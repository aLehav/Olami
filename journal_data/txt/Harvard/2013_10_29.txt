After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The words of Lucie Brock-Broido’s poetry collection “Stay, Illusion” shift enticingly in and out of clarity, reminiscent of the way that the illusions of the past haunt us even as they yield to the immediacy of life in the present. Brock-Broido’s words, however, are freighted with a strong human weight that prevents them from being frivolous. Her book itself, with its insubstantial size, is also an illusion of sorts—a slim volume, coming in just under 100 pages. Most poems are only a page long, with the longest running to three pages, but “Stay, Illusion” is no less profound for its brevity. Brock-Broido writes with an impressive agility of language throughout the collection, delivering short meditation-like poems where each word stands out as an unexpected and yet resonating presence. “Stay, Illusion” performs as a series of poetic autopsies that celebrate and commiserate with the human responses to mortality.
Such autopsies span a great variety of subjects across Brock-Broido’s poems. She inhabits dead social misfits, controversial figures like Glenn Gould and Tookie Williams, and anonymous ordinary individuals like a sheltered Norman monk. In some poems the figure of the poet as herself appears; in others, it is incarnated in an animal. “For a Snow Leopard in October,” for example, is about the soul of a buried lynx who addresses a cub playing in the snow by its grave. All of the poems, despite their variety of human and non-human experiences, are illusions covering the same image: a living soul contending with the chill of death. Fantastic deathbed visions flash in the poems: a haunting example is seen in “Observations from the Glasgow Coma Scale” when a woman tells retrospectively of her comatose state in a way that recalls the uncanniness of Dickinson’s “I Heard a Fly Buzz—When I Died.”
The result, in these works, is often a profoundly empathetic re-coloring of a picture that has already bled out all its ink. One poem has Ophelia, after her death, elegantly delivering a soliloquy that could match any of Hamlet’s seven: “I have made promises I may not keep, go on with my / Soliloquy and was some kind of beautiful.” This dead Ophelia is, if deeply pained, resigned and intelligent. The acute consciousness of mortality, like the mud that sucks Ophelia down under the peaceful flower-strewn surface of the water, is the latent violence under the surface of Brock-Broido’s tranquil language.
Despite this morbid undercurrent, Brock-Broido maintains impressive control of tone throughout her poetry collection. She renders most of her sentences in the form of flat declarative statements. Every poem ends with a quiet period—there is no storming, no trailing off in indecision, no frantic question marks—all is known, as far as it can be known, and what exists is accepted.
Most remarkable of all, then, is the quiet resuscitations and life-affirmations that Brock-Broido creates at the level of her individual words. As a poet, she becomes a courageous hero who gives fresh life not only to dead beings, but also to dead meanings of words. “Stay, Illusion,” as a result, has a distinctive serenity of language. “I was uncertain of certain mythologies, / Invisible as the milk waiting to happen / To the newborn litter of opossums,” she says in one poem. The subtle pun on “certain” changes the rhythm of her sentence, yet it pearls out all the same—uncertain of how it would arrive, but natural and effortless once it appears on the page. She walks through the ages of language, reviving neglected worthy words such as “cummerbund,” “feckless,” and “spindling,” on whom dust has settled for some time, and with a wand she reanimates these words, giving each one new glories and a revivified career. Her words move with grace and solemnity, well-bred, true to their subject matter, and never arbitrary. Yet, it cannot be charged that they are “posturing” either, since they feel uncannily natural and fitting even if one cannot entirely explain or immediately comprehend all of what they mean.
At her best, Brock-Broido has a beautiful touch that is neither too heavy nor too weak—her poems have such a vigorous and historically saturated command of the English language that they might almost be said to impart a tactile sensation. This is most beautifully demonstrated in “Pax Arcana,” her portrait of an Amish maid-servant’s life:
Her linens were chenille and bumpy, worn. Her only jewels were bobby pins. 
 After supper, after covering the crust of the rhubarb pie with a tea towel,
She retired early to her room. She took off her cotton cap.
She undid the hooks and eyes of her stiff black apron-dress,
Stood reading the chapter from the longsome blue-bound book.
The quiet domestic tone and rich evocation of textures in Brock-Broido’s language makes this poem feel like a verbal rendering of a Vermeer painting. “Pax Arcana” translates roughly from Latin to “Mysterious Peace.” This phrase is, perhaps, the best for describing the whole of her poems—a feeling of timelessness, a reminder that the end of death is beauty.
The first lines of “Lucid Interval” fiercely evoke the wondrous tie between Brock-Broido’s words and her subjects: “Tread very gingerly; you’ve used up almost all the words.” Words, like the breadcrumbs in the tale of Hansel and Gretel or the yarn Theseus used in the labyrinth of the Minotaur, are for Brock-Broido lifelines that must be used as carefully and sparingly as possible. Though an accomplished poet, Brock-Broido has great humility: “Sphinx, small print, you are inscrutable,” she declares in “Infinite Riches in the Smallest Room,” teasing her own poetry as “inscrutable” and of tiny aspect. Another time, she interrupts her poem to say, “I could barely stand to write what I just wrote just now.” For a moment, even the poet herself confesses a fear of being overmastered by the force of her own subject matter. But she must tread bravely on. Brock-Broido is herself in awe of the power she wields through words, even afraid that she may go wrong. But, like living people, she must carry on, conjuring her little words as the only way to battle the vastness of what existed before and will exist after she has said them.

“Peace man. It’s CG. I believe we can blur the lines of academia and hip-hop in a very subtle way. Get the ball rolling with new leaders of industry at esteemed Ivy institutions, etc. All through what we converse about, you know? Peace.”
 
This is the first text message I receive from Charmingly Ghetto, the Boston rapper I’ve chosen to profile next for this column. I receive it on a Tuesday mid-morning while I was in class, and it was a lot to digest. But then again, there’s a lot to digest about Charmingly Ghetto: as his name suggests, he’s one of the most earnest and contradictory figures in Boston hip-hop right now. He’s immersed in music, yet never took formal lessons on any instrument. He has a global outlook, but his sound is distinctly American. He’s working hard on his music craft, but he’s also putting in hours as a teacher for elementary school kids. All in all, Charmingly Ghetto is a puzzle—who happens to be an excellent rapper with a sharp ear for hooks.
 
Charmingly Ghetto grew up in Boston and has released a slew of mixtapes since 2011, with producers contributing beats from all over the world—Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden, and Atlanta, to name a few. He was nominated by the Boston Music Awards as one of Boston’s best rappers in 2012, and then proclaimed the Best Rapper in Boston by Noisey, Vice’s music channel, soon after. Given his quick rise and all of his accolades, it’s quite surprising to hear how noncommittal he is about diving into the music business. “All my eggs aren’t in that basket. It’s like the NBA,” he explains to me. “Some people are gonna make it, others aren’t.”
 
If the rap game was based strictly on talent, then Charmingly Ghetto would be in the big leagues by now. His rhymes are pressing, musical, and sometimes devastating— “the raw papers in rotation / or encircled with purple / the verbal got ’em leavin’ their herbal alone,” he raps on “Dreams Are,” the fifth song off his 2013 mixtape “On the Meaning of Progress.” When he performed a set at the Middle East for the XXL’s Future of Boston Showcase, his aggressive, nonstop barrage left the host emcee shaking his head and laughing afterwards (although admittedly, some of the more vulgar, trap-influenced posses onstage got the crowd more fired up). His beats are piano-driven and jazz-influenced, but they go beyond just novelty throwback—they complement his poetic lyricism perfectly. The groove on 2012’s “Hollyhood” could be a vintage Just Blaze beat and pushes his energetic optimism to new levels.
 
Charmingly Ghetto is shy about some topics and exuberant about others. When asked about the main issues he addresses, he answers vaguely, “I don’t feel like I’m trying to address anything, I just think I’m speaking...I don’t like boxes.” However, he gets psyched talking about his musical influences. “I’m so heavily into jazz right now. I’ve been listening to Miles Davis, Charles Mingus…. I can come and kick something poetic over it. We could do something real dope. ”
 
He’s most excited about the prospects of moving hip-hop into the academic world. It’s a connection that makes sense on a personal level—he’s a youth educator who claims he’s willing to go teach “anywhere I’m needed.” But he also is thinking bigger, trying to follow in the footsteps of his idol Nas, who just lent his name to the Nasir Jones Hip-Hop Fellowship at the Hip Hop Archives of Harvard. “Think about Latin. How did that survive?” he queries. “Because people are still studying it. It’s supposed to be irrelevant, but it’s not. That’s what hip-hop is gonna be one day. Who’s gonna keep speaking it? Who’s gonna give it a platform to reach people that it might not reach?”
 
For the answers, Charmingly Ghetto turns to W.E.B. DuBois, whose theory of double consciousness inspired the rapper’s two-part stage name. “DuBois grew up seeing no one that looked like him and saying, “I can go to Harvard with kids who don’t look like me and still kill it. It’s a testament to being able to assimilate and yet not forget who he is.”
 Charmingly Ghetto. Rap educator. Street intellectual. When the Boston rapper figures out who he is, the results could be monumental. Until then, I’m fine with putting on his dense beats and reveling in his contradictory, complex lyricism.

It’s official: Arcade Fire are indie rock legends. The Montreal-based collective that brought you the millennial magnum opus of 2004’s “Funeral” now have an Album of the Year Grammy under their belt and pop up regularly on “Saturday Night Live.” Their latest album, “Reflektor,” is their first release as true megastars—or as close to megastars as a French-Canadian baroque-pop-meets-punky-art-rock outfit can be—and they’ve tried their best to back up their stardom by pulling out all the stops on the new album.
 
Indeed, though they’ve always been characterized by grandiose gestures, “Reflektor” is the band’s biggest and most eclectic undertaking yet. Labyrinthine viral marketing campaigns aside, the double album’s 13 tracks tackle themes ranging from Haiti to Kierkegaard and feature production work from another indie icon, LCD Soundsystem maestro James Murphy. But while Arcade Fire are capitalizing on their newfound fame, they also seem uncomfortable with it, and unfortunately, there’s a good chance their fans will soon share this ambivalence. Yes, even though it’s no debacle, “Reflektor” is the first true disappointment of the band’s career, for even as it features a solid helping of epic Arcade Fire-ness and slickly produced grooves, it’s also overlong, disjointed, and lacking the anthemic power of the group’s best work.
 
“Reflektor” continues the Arcade Fire tradition of dealing with every event in the grandest of terms, no matter how personal. Coping with paparazzi is, to frontman Win Butler, a spiritual battle; on “Flashbulb Eyes” he sings, “What if the camera / Really do / Take your soul / Oh no.” And “Afterlife,” for which the music video features a sequence from Marcel Camus’s 1959 film “Black Orpheus,” lends a mythic guise to the aftermath of a romance. “After all the breath and the dirt and the fires are burnt,” Butler pleads with his wavering tenor, “Can we work it out?”
 
What unites these various themes is a pervasive feeling of aloneness. But the pain of the lyrics often rings hollow when paired with the album’s sleek, dance-ready disco aesthetic. The title track is an anguished chronicle of isolation in the digital age, but you wouldn’t know that from its tight Blondie-esque drums and stabbing saxophone riffs that seem crafted for a nightclub audience. The song’s ear-catching fragments—its snappy “just a Reflektor” hook, for instance—are just that: short digestible phrases that a liquored-up audience can grab onto while bobbing along to the solid but repetitive beat. The song simply isn’t an adequate vehicle for its heavy content.
 
Elsewhere on the album, though, Murphy’s electronic touches work to expand the already cinematic Arcade Fire sound. The refrain of “We Exist” would be at home on any of the band’s projects; twinkling piano lines spar with jagged violin interjections over a guitar texture with just enough classic-rock distortion. But Murphy kicks the track up a notch, adding a deep, buzzing bass and reverb-heavy drums that build to a well-earned release.
 
Murphy may be the album’s marquee guest star, but its most thrilling moments actually come from Butler’s wife, singer Régine Chassagne, who is woefully underutilized as a vocalist. While her solo songs rank among the highlights of the band’s past albums, she is here relegated mostly to the background. When she does pop in, though, she’s glorious, saving weaker tracks from total failure. “Normal Person” is a generic guitar-driven rocker, but Chassagne pierces its overwhelming fuzz with an uplifting, angelic interlude that steals the otherwise boring and unoriginal song.
 
Even as “Reflektor” shows flashes of excitement, there’s no truly great song on the album. The rousing shout-along chorus of 2004’s “Wake Up”? The percussive, satirical hook of their last album’s “Rococo”? “Reflektor” has no moments like these. Too many tracks show potential and fail to deliver, a fault that carries over to the whole album. Sure, the material will make for a great live show. It’ll probably get some decent airplay, too, with the few hooks it has. And hey, at least they’re still experimenting, right? That question might excuse a lesser band, but this is Arcade Fire in 2013. They’ve stepped out of their neighborhood, out of the suburbs, onto the world stage. They’re indie rock legends, and they’re better than this.

On YouTube, anyone can find a home. There are the amateur twerkers, the singers trying to go viral with their renditions of “Wrecking Ball,” the comedians, the rappers, the cats, the news reporters’ bloopers, and the politicians’ filibusters. I am happy all of these different types of videos have found a haven on YouTube and personally spend many hours watching marriage proposal fails. But lately, it seems more and more that YouTube’s welcoming nature towards content is also dangerous. It has become an outlet for crime, criminals, and violence. With videos of everything from beheadings to gang initiations, YouTube too often gives violence a popular forum where an audience can watch and learn. When a video of a gang shooting is on the same feed as a talking dog, we begin to think of crime as just another form of entertainment.
 Why is this dangerous? Violence is a daily part of pop culture, you may say, so we should be used to it by now. It’s impossible to turn on the news without hearing about some atrocious story. But the presence of crime on social media sites, specifically YouTube but also Facebook and Instagram, is uniquely worrying because it offers a constant outlet for perpetrators. With the speed it takes to upload a video and the huge amount of content on YouTube, the outpouring of violent images makes it much easier for predators to feel as if their actions are normal and acceptable. For viewers, these videos offer a chance to vicariously participate in a crime. Viewers are constantly in the role of bystanders, looking on at a crime and never intervening—which is terrible preparation for an everyday situation where you actually may be called on to help. Jumping into action to intervene in violence is probably much harder when you are used to the role of immobile audience member. 
 YouTube also has become a site of modern-day warfare for gang violence in cities like New York and Chicago. Graffiti tagging used to be a popular way to identify oneself as a gang member and to incite crime with rivals in the area. Now, social media and videos are taking over. Just this last summer in August, after a suspected gang member, Blake Lamb, was shot and killed in Chicago, a YouTube video was quickly posted which showed rival gang members taunting Lamb’s body at the scene of the crime. Rap videos with threats towards other gang members have also spread widely. Instagram and Facebook have many of these same issues as well; it’s become popular on Instagram, for example, for criminals to post pictures of their guns and money, to brag about their sway. But YouTube specifically has become a safe haven for the most graphic threats—countless videos show what happens when you mess with the wrong gang. 
 And what’s even worse, finding a solution seems to be very complex. Censorship becomes such a sticky question, as once you censor one video it’s very easy to find excuses to censor many more without a good reason. But while the issue of censoring videos is a difficult one to tackle, we must be on the lookout for other creative ways to address the problem of making violence such a publically accepted norm. Cracking down on punishments for gangs that post threatening videos or even just widespread cultural condemnation, rather than acceptance, of the practice would be a start. Law enforcement should also take advantage of these criminal advertisements to find the perpetrators and stop them before more crimes are committed, videos recorded, and people murdered.
 Interestingly, this week we saw a positive side of crime’s presence on YouTube. In September, an Ohio man named Matthew Cordle confessed to killing a man in a hit and run in a YouTube video. He was sentenced this week to six and a half years in prison and a lifetime suspension of violence. Cordle made the video with the intention to come clean and to accept whatever consequences came his way, unable to bear the guilt any longer. The victim’s family has since said that Cordle’s video, with its sincerity and honesty, encouraged them to not seek the maximum sentence in his case. Cordle’s brave initiative to admit to his wrongdoings in a public video show the positive possibilities that could exist for crime’s relationship with YouTube. Perhaps, instead of a place where violence is greedily gorged upon, we can strive to make it become a site where people seek forgiveness and justice. This sounds too idealistic, maybe, but worth a try. 
 There is already so much violence in everyday life—on the streets or on the news. We should do our best to make sure hate and fear are constantly quashed and denied, and this can mean helping someone in need or on a smaller level, contributing to the online community in a positive way—maybe flagging a violent video or two. The frightening thing about posting videos is that somewhere, someone is watching and maybe sharing. It’s crucial to remember that with one click, more hate spreads and it becomes much harder to contain.

“Story of My Life”
 One Direction, “Midnight Memories”
 
For a band whose oldest member has yet to turn 22, it seems a little premature to release a song entitled “Story of My Life.” For One Direction, however, youth is no deterrent to heartache. Their newest single is a kick-drum happy anthem in the vein of Mumford & Sons that seems content to skate by with lyrics that would be clichés if they were coherent—“written on these walls are the colors that I can’t change”—before bursting into a soaring chorus that feels all the more empty for its bombastic attempts to create emotional depth.
 

 
“Venus”
Lady Gaga, “ARTPOP” 
“ARTPOP” is rapidly approaching, and with her most recent single from the album, “Venus,” Lady Gaga herself is entering new territory: outer space. An electronic, galactic romp, “Venus” is a whole lot of noise with just enough substance to succeed as a single. It’s true that Gaga’s power belting feels a little flat on this newest track, and she seems to have traded in some of her signature wit for the like of the stunted pre-chorus line “take me to your planet.” However, the track is saved by a campy roll call of the planets at the end of the track, and a whole lot of Gaga verve.
 
"Let Me Go" ft. Chad Kroeger
Avril Lavigne, "Avril Lavigne" 
 
In her newest single, Avril seems to be dead-set on convincing her listeners that she is now very, very mature. Instead of being polished or adventurous, however, "Let Me Go" is ponderous and heavy. Seemingly centered on some kind of trauma, the lyrics are at once histrionic and hollow: "I've said goodbye / Set it all on fire." The instrumentation is similarly uninspired, alternating between a sickly-sad piano melody accompanied by violins and a muddy drum beat during more expansive moments. If nothing else, "Let Me Go" has spawned a terrific music video, which features unfortunate product placement, a shape-shifting Chad Kroeger, and the subtle symbolism of an hourglass that runs in reverse.

The CW’s new series, “Reign,” is one of many series that attempts to inject sex into history. The teen drama about Mary, Queen of Scots, is not the first—nor will it be the last—television show to force historic figures into every sex position and pairing possible and lead to wonderfully misinformed high school history papers. Recently, however, “Reign” has caught the attention of critics because of the CW’s decision to cut a masturbation scene from the pilot episode, highlighting network television’s aversion to self-pleasure.
 
In the pilot episode, Mary and her female handmaidens observe a post-marital bedding scene. Afterwards, one of the handmaidens, Kenna (played by Caitlin Stasey), sits in an empty stairwell and reaches under her dress and begins to masturbate. In the edited version, however, Kenna only gets to lift her skirts before the King of France (Alan Van Sprang) interrupts with “May I?” In a boring twist of events, the monarch takes over and the two “form the beast with two backs.”
 
The Shakespeare reference is from a play written nearly four decades after Mary, Queen of Scots died, but since “Reign” sacrifices period realism to the softcore sex gods, I’m going to give myself a break on this one. Examples include inventing a roguish half-brother of the actual King of France and portraying Nostradamus, who would have been in his 50s or 60sin the series’s setting, as a young stud.
 
Critics have posited many possible reasons why the masturbation scene was cut. Spoiler alert: none of them are particularly flattering. Tracy Clark-Flory writes in Salon that the masturbation came to a premature end because female masturbation places women in control of their sexuality, which does not fit in with conventional depictions of sex. “Women are supposed to be the undesiring sex—or rather, the sex that desires the things we can get through intercourse, not the act itself,” Clark-Flory writes “Why is masturbation more shocking then sex?” This line of thought finds support in the sequence of events of the episode itself. The public masturbator, Kenna, is aroused by watching a couple consummate their marriage. Instead of bringing herself to climax, a man, a monarch, nonetheless takes over, which Kenna accepts. The cause and the product of her desire both revolve around heterosexual, conventional acts of sex. If the King had not swooped in to save Kenna from self-pleasure, the CW would have actually aired a woman engaging in sexual activity for no other reason than her own satisfaction.
 
In response to Clark-Flory, however, Katy Waldman of Slate argues that sexism is less relevant than the distance between sex and masturbation: romance. (I was tempted to write female orgasm, but that wouldn’t be fair to the King of France). “From a network perspective, masturbation is more shocking than public intercourse not because it returns sexual agency to women but because it severs pleasure from intimacy or emotional connection,” Waldman writes. “People tune into a network television period drama for fantasy and escape, not to watch characters do what you do alone on a Tuesday night in between loads of laundry.”
 
Though I am reluctant to separate gender politics from the CW’s decision to cut the masturbation scene, Waldman does make a worthwhile point. A handmaiden being sought after by a monarch is much better fodder for escapist pleasure than a servant masturbating in an empty stairwell. Furthermore, as in life, sex is not just sex in television. Though “Reign” is not necessarily high art, it is a narrative and conflict is integral. Sex is where characters and their desires can intersect or conflict. The absence of a sexual partner leaves a dramatic vacancy that is hard to fill by one’s own hand, regardless of pleasure. Clark-Flory writes that women are supposed to be “the sex that desires the things we can get through intercourse, not the act itself,” but it’s arguable that in narrative, characters act with goals in mind. Sexual acts are not exceptions to the demands of plot. Though Kenna’s masturbation scene would have been a step forward for network television, Kenna sleeping with Mary’s husband will probably create more drama than a muffled orgasm in a stairwell.
 
Though excluding masturbation from the episode can be justified by the demands of plot, “Reign” has raised questions about network television’s sexual politics by choosing to present a masturbation scene and interrupting it. Since “Reign” is a television series instead of a sex education program, it is not required to represent female masturbation; most series don’t. But by presenting a masturbation scene and interrupting, “Reign” raised a lot of questions about network television’s sexual politics. Perhaps the CW feared that parents would have to have awkward conversations with their children about self-pleasure; those conversations shouldn’t have to be awkward, but that’s a topic for another article. Replacing the masturbation scene with an act of infidelity committed between a man of high status and a much younger woman in order to make the episode more appropriate underscores taboos towards self-pleasure. If masturbation is not fit for public consumption but graphic sex is, then perhaps we have become desensitized to sex and fearful of sexuality. How network television deems graphic sex more fit for public consumption than masturbation paints a grim portrait of the industry’s attitudes towards sex and its viewers. An audience that subscribes to the values reinforced by series such as “Reign” would have to be desensitized to sex but fearful of sexuality.

Remember mixtapes? Crimson Arts does. Welcome to our biweekly feature, where we create mixtapes for every emotion and every season—for breakups, breakdowns, and breakdancing. This week our mixtape is a two-part feature dedicated to all the creepy crawlies you may encouter this Halloween. 
We’ve all heard “Monster Mash” and the bevy of other campy, themed songs that are purposefully churned out as Halloween party anthems. Even more critically laudable tracks like “Thriller” are intentionally focused on being bumped full-volume at costume parties. The redundancy of All Hallow’s Eve playlists carries with it a certain beautiful nostalgia. That being said, it’s time to find songs about monsters, ghouls, and hauntings that can be raged to—but aren’t so stale and obviously Halloween-centric that you find yourself rolling your eyes ten seconds in. Here’s Part I, focusing on external demons, of a two-part mixtape spectacular featuring spooky songs that weren’t obviously written with Oct. 31 in mind. Listen along. And stay tuned for part two.
 
“Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps),” David Bowie 
Bowie’s werewolf growls punctuate the screeching Robert Fripp guitar-solo intro to the title track of Bowie’s 1980 LP. Uptempo acoustic strumming accompanies Bowie’s harrowing story of a sociopathic lover whose potentially homicidal qualities keep him “running scared.” Fripp’s acidic line soars into the stratosphere as ghoulish moans and utterances bring the tale to a frenzied conclusion.

 
“Monster,” Kanye West (ft. Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Bon Iver)
A six-minute opus about the inevitable pairing of success and villainization, West laments how his consistent brilliance makes him grotesque. Buoyed by a guttural, almost unrecognizable Bon Iver (especially scary for those familiar with the rest of his output), a schizophrenic Nicki Minaj, and an incensed Jay-Z (“All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers”), the track bounces on a sample-free, minimalist beat. For extra scaries, check out the (frighteningly misogynistic) music video.
 
“Halloween,” The Dead Kennedys
 
The fact that the big day is in the title sort of goes against theme, but here Halloween acts as a metaphor for the moments where humans admit their daily dress-up routine. Jello Biafra acerbically challenges the listener to acknowledge her “mold” and asks “why not every day?” The call to meta-cognition is accompanied by a frenetic bass line that is easy to get lost in, especially if you aren’t up to Biafra’s call to confront all of your illusions.

 
“Spooky Mormon Hell Dream,” The Book of Mormon
 
Elder Price, the protagonist of the Broadway smash “The Book of Mormon,” is transported into a hellish landscape after confronting his guilt for getting his brother in trouble as a small child. The surrealistic descent into Hades, replete with bravura musical appearances from Genghis Khan, Hitler, and Jeffrey Dahmer, as well as a spine-chilling full gospel choir and a fantastic guitar solo, is ideal for those looking to condemn Halloween’s paganism in good fun.

 
“Creep,” TLC
Although the song is clearly about choosing to “creep” around (i.e. cheat) in response to a partner’s infidelity—as opposed to anything inherently “creepy” or Halloween-centric—something about the laid-back beat and horn line is chilly and unsettling. The complete absence of malice in Left Eye’s voice, even when dealing with ostensibly upsetting subject matter, adds to the emotional distance of the track, which feels more than a little spooky especially considering the extremely creepy story of Left Eye’s premonitions of her own demise.
 
“Dance Cadaverous,” Wayne Shorter
 
Perfect for the pre or post-game to a Halloween rage, sit back with a pumpkin cocktail and spin Wayne Shorter’s meandering and foreboding track from his 1965 album “Speak No Evil.” The title evokes a skeletal polka, which is is musically mirrored by the sparse, pale Herbie Hancock piano and Freddie Hubbard trumpet. Shorter’s sax takes the cake though, with a minor, often dissonant line oozing with fear.

 
“Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But…,” Arctic Monkeys
 
This adrenaline-drenched jam features a sexy, cynical, and paranoid line from prodigious Alex Turner that proclaims, “All you people are vampires!” A middle finger to fake fans, the song works equally well in the literal. The extended, complex bridge sounds like a chase with a bloodthirsty beast; guitars intermingle in their impossibly fast arpeggios up, down, and around the fretboard before a climactic scream from Turner, which blossoms into a final frenzied solo.

 
“So Haunted,” Cut Copy
 
This electro-pop gem by underappreciated Australian group Cut Copy is the sonic equivalent of a trippy haunted house. From the Lou Reed-esque ghoulish crooning of lead singer Dan Whitford to the shaky synth that accompanies the chorus (“Get so haunted I’ll fall in your dreams tonight”), the track oozes macabre. Listen for the incredibly groovy and danceable keyboard breakdown near the end of the song that flirts with building back up before it curiously fades out.

 
“Voodoo Child (Slight Return),” The Jimi Hendrix Experience
 
One of the funkiest opening riffs of all time descends into a thrashing, schizophrenic guitar concerto. Hendrix proclaims his self-identification as a “Voodoo Chile!” before unleashing some of his most possessed guitar work of all time. One can’t help but imagine a Hendrix doll being poked by needles as his notes seem to writhe, shake, and vanish in a devilish blaze of glory. 
  
“Transylvania,” Tyler, The Creator
 
The most offensive and disturbing song on “Goblin,” an album full of them, Tyler imagines himself as Dracula, biting the necks of women the world over. The pitch-modulated vocals, which bring Tyler’s vicious lyrics deep into the bass register, complement the catchy and foreboding horror movie-inspired synth beat. Scarier than any production are Tyler’s violently sexual sentiments, which have caused extensive controversy and make for truly chilling listening.

Remember mixtapes? Crimson Arts does. Welcome to our biweekly feature, where we create mixtapes for every emotion and every season—for breakups, breakdowns, and breakdancing. This week our mixtape is a two-part feature dedicated to all the creepy crawlies you may encouter this Halloween.
Welcome to part two of our Halloween mixtape spectacular. Whereas we can run from the monsters we met on Pt.1, we often find ourselves unable to escape our inner demons.  We have the ability to create our own personal Frankensteins that are scarier than anything we can find jumping out of the grave. Consider staying in this Halloween and taking a listen through this mixtape. Although these ten tracks don’t address the ghosts, vampires, and zombies that will prowl the streets, they are certainly horrifying in their own right. Listen along.
 
“You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are,” Keaton Henson
 
It begins with a simple guitar melody, messy harmonics played over a thin whir that sounds like ringing wine glasses. If you’re imagining a handsomely unhandsome man with sad eyes and an inconsolable beard hunched over a guitar in an empty room, you’re not far from the truth. Henson sings, hushed and insistent, “Does his love make your head spin? Does his love make your head spin?”
 
“Casimir Pulaski Day,” Sufjan Stevens
 
Casual listeners might grossly misinterpret “Casimir Pulaski Day.” A bouncing guitar riff, a banjo line, and a triumphant brass section accompany Stevens as he recalls that after his love’s death from a terminal illness, her father drove his car into the Navy Yard, just to prove that he was sorry. Stevens quietly describes the moment she dies with the image of a cardinal hitting a window—the banjo plays on.
 
“virginia,” Julia Brown
 
“I watched the sun rise in your kitchen,” begins lead singer Sam Ray, skirting the line between pedestrian and intimate. This memory’s poignant specificity turns into “virginia,” a fuzzy, lo-fi waltz that flits back and forth between nostalgia, thoughts of suicide, and the quickly fading memory of a road trip, expertly tied together in a mere five lines.
 
“So You Wanna Be a Superhero,” Carissa’s Wierd
 
Lead singer Jenn Ghetto wants to be a superhero—that’s what she keeps insisting as she essentially lists symptoms of depression in her verses. The hardest-hitting part of the track is when she finally admits that her dreams may be realized too late. Her voice rings almost as if it’s just in your head. “I’ll make you proud someday,” she promises. “I just won’t be around to see your face.”
 
“Wake,” The Antlers
 
After his terminally ill loved one passes away, the narrator of Peter Silberman’s concept album “Hospice” confides that “Now that everyone’s an enemy, my heart sinks.” The entire song is one long apology, culminating in “When your helicopter came and tried to lift me out, I put its rope around my neck.” But by the end, he’s the one who’s forgiving her—the song ends with eight repetitions of the line “don’t ever let anyone tell you you deserve that.”  
 
“Breakfast in Bed,” Dntel ft. Conor Oberst 
 
Watching someone you love go through pain is worse than taking it all upon yourself. That’s why Conor Oberst’s accusations (“You said you wanna die, now you say you wanna live”) turn so quickly into brutally honest admissions of love (“We can lay around, you can kiss me until the maids come kick us out”). 
 
“How To Disappear Completely,” Radiohead
 
It only lasts for about four seconds, but the chillingly quiet note cluster that opens “How To Disappear Completely” might be the most magical moment on “Kid A.” The eerie tone transforms into a backdrop for Thom Yorke, who seems to be reciting from the diary of a madman—half of the lines Yorke delivers are “I’m not here / This isn’t happening / I’m not here / I’m not here.”
 
“Amy In The White Coat,” Bright Eyes
 
We can imagine a different world—one in which Bright Eyes singer Oberst decides that maybe an unforgivingly explicit song about a girl who gets abused by her father just isn’t necessary. But Oberst instead decides to speak in shockingly specific detail, his voice wavering wildly as he plays the part of the father, whispering, “Your older sisters, I had them, too / but you’re my favorite, you know it’s true.”
 
“Sing About Me, I’m Dying Of Thirst,” Kendrick Lamar
 
“good kid, m.A.A.d city” is a turbulent and emotionally charged journey through growing up in Compton. “Sing About Me, I’m Dying Of Thirst” is the album’s heartbreaking version of a posse cut, but with Lamar taking all three characters’ verses, one for Dave’s brother, one for Keisha’s sister, and one for himself. By the end of the track, Kendrick is alone—one verse ends abruptly in gunshots and the other just fades away.
 
“Say Yes,” Elliott Smith
 
It could be argued that “Say Yes” is one of Smith’s more optimistic songs. A pop chord progression accompanies Smith’s assertion that he’s turned his life around and is finally in love with the world. But in the context of the rest of his shortened career, “Say Yes” seems more like a desperate attempt to manufacture happiness than any genuine expression of it.

The most frustrating scene in “12 Years a Slave” occurs fairly early on in the film, once the free black man Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has been kidnapped and awaits his sale as a slave. Trapped in a Washington, D.C. prison, he cries out, “Help me!  Somebody help me!” Slowly, the camera pans up—past the bars of his prison, past the rooftops, until it finally settles on the imposing dome of the US Capitol. The most irksome thing about this shot is how it suggests the rest of the film will be just as heavy-handed. Instead, “12 Years a Slave” is a remarkably subtle film. Though it has a strong sense of morality, it rarely moralizes, letting the atrocities onscreen speak for themselves. Brutal, painful, and harrowing, it stands as one of the finest films of the year. 
 “12 Years a Slave” is based on the eponymous book by Northup, who was tricked into leaving his home in Saratoga Springs, New York and ended up as a slave in the Deep South for more than a decade. At the heart of this story, there’s a terrifying absurdity—terrifying because this is Northup’s new reality. Director Steve McQueen smartly capitalizes on this, lending the earlier scenes of the film an almost Kafkaesque quality; whenever Northup tries to assert his identity as a free and educated man, he’s mercilessly beaten and told that his name is “Platt.” These scenes have a pummeling effect, and not just because of the constant violence—they forcefully present the cruelty of slavery in a hauntingly absurdist manner.
 These early scenes also display the magnificent talents of Ejiofor. Northup is a complex character—he’s traumatized but somehow supercilious, polite yet defiant, and tortured but guarded—but Ejiofor manages to carry off these diverse attitudes convincingly. One of the final shots in the film simply focuses on Ejiofor’s face as he silently stares into the camera; it’s a long take, and it would have been wasted on a less subtly expressive actor. 
 Had Ejiofor faltered, “12 Years a Slave” would likely have fallen apart; despite the considerable talents of supporting actors like Michael Fassbender, Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, and, yes, Brad Pitt, the film’s only consistent thread is Northup, who’s shuttled around from slaveowner to slaveowner . The film’s closest analogue is Roman Polanski’s “The Pianist,” another story of a hapless individual caught up in tragedy on a massive scale. Like that film’s protagonist, Wladysaw Szpilman, Northup doesn’t so much make history as experience it; random events befall him, and somehow he survives. This randomness of the film turns into one of its most compelling aspects, as it mirrors the uncertain nature of life on a plantation. Violence erupts out of thin air, and often from unlikely sources: one of the film’s most shocking moments comes when Fassbender’s jealous wife throws a crystal decanter at a slave girl, piercing her cheek. Despite the Hans Zimmer score, this is ferociously unsentimental stuff.
Thankfully, the loose plotting doesn’t only function as commentary; it also allows McQueen to develop the various characters at a natural pace. Had the episodic quality of “12 Years” been contorted into a clear narrative arc—or worse, had each episode been devised as a moral fable—characters like Cumberbatch’s kind slave-owner would have become mere stereotypes. Only Brad Pitt, who plays a Canadian saint deposited into the Deep South, is forced to make do with a less than three-dimensional figure; even the outrageously cruel slaveowner Epps, played by Fassbender, is distinguished by his unsettling religious fervor.
Although the film doesn’t exhibit a three-act structure or a classical dramatic arc, it never lacks purpose. When the real Northup published “Twelve Years a Slave” in 1853, his aim was to inform the public of the horrors of slavery. McQueen’s film will surely remind its audience of that blight on American history. But it doesn’t limit itself to that. Subtly but surely, it shows the awakening of Northup’s conscience. Early on in the film, Northup, playing a fiddle at a slave auction, witnesses a mother being torn from her son. As she cries hysterically, he doesn’t know how to react; all he can do is pick up his instrument and frantically saw away. By the end of his twelve-year sentence, he knows exactly what to do.

A seductress and killer in 1930s Shanghai. A guerilla fighter in Civil War-era Missouri. An Indian man sharing a lifeboat with a tiger. A 19th-century English gentleman in love.
Ang Lee has brought all of these characters to life. Over his 21 years as a professional director, Lee has explored many challenging and riveting stories through cinema, including “Sense and Sensibility” (1995), “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (2000), “Hulk” (2003), and “Brokeback Mountain” (2005). On Friday, Lee participated in a symposium at the Harvard Sackler Museum celebrating his diverse works. The symposium featured a panel with Lee and his collaborative partner, producer and screenwriter James Schamus, and four acclaimed professors who discussed various aspects of Lee’s body of work.
During the symposium, Lee and Schamus reminisced on their careers. Schamus joked that when Lee came to him to pitch his first movie, 1992’s “Pushing Hands,” the meeting was “horrific.” “I thought it was one of the worst professional moments I had ever had,” he said. Despite this inauspicious beginning, the two teamed up for 11 consecutive films, and Lee compared his relationship with Schamus to that of a boxer and his cornerman.
The Taiwanese-born Lee has made movies in both English and Chinese and in both the United States and China, leading Boston College Professor Christina Klein to call him a wholly diasporic filmmaker. Lee responded by acknowledging that there are traces of his Taiwanese heritage in all of his movies, even the cowboy romance “Brokeback Mountain.” He also contrasted censorship in Hollywood and China, suggesting that L.A. bigshots could be just as restrictive if not more than government censorship. “Because of commercial pressure, it’s harder to make a movie in the states than it is under the Chinese government,” he said.
After the panel, Lee sat down with The Crimson.
The Harvard Crimson: How do you prepare yourself for directing movies?
Ang Lee: I never feel like a movie is work. It’s like something possesses me. I feel the call and respond to it. If you’re thinking hard, you get really stiff. If you think the other way around, naturally you’re modest and perceptive, and things will open up.
THC: What kinds of stories particularly resonate with you?
AL: Themes that are are familiar but different, like gay cowboys. People that are on the disadvantaged side, or on the fringe: in “Ride With The Devil,” for instance, you see a slave self-emancipating in the South instead of an owner saving a slave. It’s an odd angle, not conventional, but it makes human sense. Maybe it’s because I grew up in Taiwan, and we’re always losing. So those on the wrong side of history, to grow up with that, my heart races to those characters very easily.
THC: Can you speak to the Asian-American experience and say how you try to capture it through film?
AL: It’s hard to sum up what that experience is, because things keep changing, I think, for the better. I wouldn’t do “The Wedding Banquet” now. “The Wedding Banquet, released in 1993, portrays a false marriage between two Asians in New York that serves to cover up a gay relationship.] The story doesn’t relate. When I was making the movie, Taiwan was conservative, and it was taboo to even mention [homosexuality]. The convention was, a person in the closet finds freedom in America. But less than 10 years after that movie, Taiwan has changed so much. It’s a lot more liberal than here.
THC: “Life of Pi” was hailed as a major breakthrough in 3D exploration. In terms of the 3D medium, do you think that groundbreaking films like “Life of Pi” and “Gravity” now are just the tip of the iceberg?
AL: Yes. We have not even started yet. A lot of filmmakers would disagree. They hope it comes and goes. But I think there’s a whole new art form to be embraced.
I don’t want to talk about it too much because I’m going to explore it in the next movie, I hope. [Lee’s next movie will portray the Ali-Frazier fights in 3D.] But there will be better resolution, and the treatment of colors, lighting and performance will have to change accordingly. I think that right now, people are doing 3D like a 3D enhancement of 2D—they’re just dimensionalizing 2D thinking. I think the thinking will change; the experience will be different. But right now, we’re not even equipped to do that.
THC: You’ve dramatized periods like the Civil War, Qing Dynasty China, and hippie-era Woodstock in your films. How does history inspire you?
AL: Naturally, working in a different period gives a distance to create art. “Once upon a time, far far away” is a good way to tell a story: you know what happened, and you also know the consequences. You have a complete view.
Ironically, we have a theatrical tradition that becomes part of history and culture. A lot of what we believe matter-of-factly, and even history in the textbooks, is actually wrong. But if you want to do the right thing, you could end up on the wrong side of the audience. I’m still learning how to hit the sweet spot: I don’t want to make pictures that make me feel righteous, but also are flops.
THC: After 2003’s “The Hulk,” you briefly considered retiring. How long are you going to stay in the business?
AL: I don’t think about that anymore. I used to have that anxiety. I think my body and my audience will let me know. If people are really lukewarm three pictures in a row, maybe it’s time to retire [laughs]. But I know if I start a project, I will want to finish it. For better or worse, I hate the feeling of incompletion.

In a meta-theatrical moment in “Not Another Horror Movie,” Kevin (Joseph F. Tabasco ’15) ran away from his killer, turned to the audience, and seized control of his fate, transforming his character from victim to murderer. “Not Another Horror Movie,” a play directed by Daniel A. Citron ’16, ran through Sunday in the Adams Pool Theatre. The show succeeded as a comedy and also questioned the timeworn horror movie plot—high school students camping in the woods with an axe-murderer on the prowl diverged into an unexpected change of events. The script, written by Citron and Hayden S. Betts ’16, is nuanced and provides an interesting twist on the generic horror story, while the good acting helped alleviate some of the script’s awkwardness. 
Kevin is the nerd among a group of six students who embody different high school stereotypes. Along with the nerd, there is a stoner, Trent (Curtis H. Stone ’17); a jock, Greg (Kyle R. Whelihan ’17); a loser, Harriett (Kathryn A. McCawley ’17); a good girl, Alice (Aurelia R. Paquette ’17); and a bad girl, Stacey (Emilie G. C. Thompson ’16). The story follows their school trip into the woods.
 
Along with the six high school students, there is an ominous and ruthless Killer (Steven Kunis ’17) terrorizing the woods. When Kevin, Harriett, and Kevin’s crush, Alice, stumble upon a dead body, Kevin and Alice flee, leaving Harriett to be the Killer’s first victim. Poised to be the second victim in what is turning into a predictable sequence of murders—one student killed after the other until there is only one left—Kevin makes his mark. Kevin, previously perceived as a nerdy goody-two-shoes, stabs the Killer to death.
This shocking action is a new plot twist to an age-old story. Now, with Kevin as the murderer confronting the remaining students one at a time, the plot sequence takes an unexpected turn. Tabasco’s performance was convincing and his soliloquies, though long-winded and sometimes hard to follow, gave depth to his role and the show. His soliloquies approach meta-theater and emphasize the relatively little control the characters in the show have over their actions. This interplay is at the heart of the show; the writers explore whether the characters are part of a preconceived story or have the ability to affect the events of which they are a part.
 
This more profound angle compensates for the rest of the show’s sometimes juvenile script. The jokes are immature and trivial, and various attempts of the actors to deliver witty remarks frankly flopped. On the other hand, the actors personified their characters’ stereotypes to the fullest—a strength of both the directing and acting. The characters were entertaining: Greg’s descriptions of his high school athletic glory and Trent’s love of smoking marijuana provided comic relief.
 
Furthermore, the script portrayed teenage romance in interesting ways throughout the production: Kevin’s obsession with Alice and his unrequited love spurs him to anger and murder, and Greg pursues Stacey—a girl who brags about being an easy conquest—in a shallow manner until her rejection of him reveals she has higher standards than she admits. Ultimately and surprisingly, when Alice turns favorably to Kevin, he has already become a murdering monster, not the good, nerdy boy that he was.
 
The show explores conventionalism in its structure as a traditional horror story. By altering the standard recipe for a scary movie, the show gives a fresh twist to a classic genre. The actors portraying average high school stereotypes were appealing in their roles. Though the script sometimes falls flat, its monologues illustrate the intellectual aspects in the production. Citron and Betts told a fresh story, the strength of which was in its well-performed characters and its challenge of  a typical horror narrative.

“Nearly 40 years ago Greil, California-born and Berkeley-trained, changed the landscape of American music criticism,” began Werner M. Sollors, professor of English and African-American studies, as he introduced the first of Greil Marcus’s contributions to the William E. Massey Lectures. “He described in surprising and vivid metaphors the rock and roll he heard,” Sollors said.
 
Now, after working as a rock critic and columnist for Rolling Stone in its early years, as well as writing for Salon, The New York Times, Artforum, Esquire, and The Village Voice and publishing several books, Marcus has brought criticism of popular music into the academy, teaching at Berkeley and the New School in New York and delivering lectures on music.
 
The talk he delivered Monday in the Sackler Auditorium was part of the William E. Massey, Sr., Lectures in American Studies, which have been an annual tradition since 1983, endowed by an anonymous donor in honor of the former president of A.T. Massey Coal Company to bring distinguished figures in the arts and letters to speak at Harvard.
 
Past lecturers have included Gish Jen, Richard Rorty, Toni Morrison and Gore Vidal. Marcus was chosen in part, Sollors said, because, “he boldly consider[s] popular culture equivalent to canonical literature in shaping a national discourse.” Monday’s lecture was the first in a series of three titled, “Three Songs, Three Singers, Three Nations,” and each night’s lecture focused on a particular song by a particular folk singer: first was Bob Dylan, followed by the lesser-known Geeshie Wiley and Bascom Lamar Lunsford.
 
Marcus, who sees folk songs as bedrock documents of American identity, focused the first lecture on Dylan’s “Ballad of Hollis Brown,” and through examining the song’s history and its sound, Marcus spoke of how it has transcended its origins as a song and story invented by Dylan to become as classic as any old folk standard.
 
He began by vividly detailing an early performance of the song on a 1963 Westinghouse television special hosted by John Henry Faulk. In the midst of lively cartoons and performances celebrating the folk revival as a new American patriotism, Dylan’s performance of “Hollis Brown” was hauntingly minimalist, Marcus said. “As the cartoon landscape disappears into a black backdrop, you’re brought into the story: A failing farm, a starving family, and a father who kills them all.”
 
Marcus explained the history of the song’s conception, most broadly that it was based on the blues form of songs such as “Pretty Polly,” a traditional murder ballad. “The structure of ‘Pretty Polly’…is always the shape of the blues; that’s what the structure of ‘Hollis Brown’ is: Those first two verses and then a third verse knocking them dead,” he said.
 
“Hollis Brown” was recorded on Dylan’s 1964’s album “The Times They Are  a-Changin’.” It had taken Dylan several years of  working on the song before he was ready to record this powerful performance.
 
“When he first sang [“Hollis Brown”] in public there’s no sense of event, there’s no sense that something’s happening as you listen,” Marcus said. Dylan’s subsequent performances, Marcus said, were still too preachy. “He’s giving a speech,” Marcus said of an earlier recording of the song. “‘There is a farm problem! We need a new farm policy!’” he said, speaking in jest of Dylan’s uninviting delivery.
 
In the song’s final form, Marcus explained, Dylan brings the listener in and makes him or her complicit in the crime. “What is happening in the song is happening as you listen,” Marcus said. “[The farmer] is standing in front of you, and he’s holding out his hand.”
 
“With that, the song walked away from Bob Dylan and into the world as if it had always been there, which it had,” Marcus said.  According to Marcus, part of this timelessness is its relation to the theme of poverty, which could have made it a song of the 1930s or even a ballad from the depression of the 1890s. “‘The Ballad of Hollis Brown’ seems set in the past because American poverty is so easily turned into art,” Marcus said.
 
To Marcus, folk music blurs the line between originality and tradition, as all new music is deeply rooted in the folk canon and every singer puts a unique stamp on the classics. “In the American folk song, there’s a language that, as people speak the same phrases as everyone else, seduces or compels them to add their own shadings,” he said. “Any statement can appear at once as commonplace and individual, something that anyone might say, but now heard in a way that no one else would ever say it.”
 
To complement his detailed description of the song’s sound, Marcus finally played the recording of the song from “The Times They Are a-Changin’.” The audience sat in silence as they listened to Dylan’s recorded voice sing, “Well there’s seven people dead / On a South Dakota farm / Somewheres in the distance / There’s seven new people born.”

Anne Carson is one of the most renowned Canadian poets alive today, having received, among other awards, the T.S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, a MacArthur Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Known for the genre-breaking original works “Short Talks,” “Autobiography of Red,” and “Red doc>,” much of her oeuvre is also the translation and reinterpretation of ancient Greek works. One such reinterpretation, “Antigonick,” is a book of dialogue printed in the poet’s original handwriting and illustrated by hand by Bianca Stone. The work is being performed this weekend by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club at the Loeb Ex Theatre, under the direction of visiting director Ianthe Demos. Carson, who is travelling and could only be reached by email, discussed her work with The Crimson. Answers are printed as given.
 
The Harvard Crimson: Your work as a translator has focused mainly on the archaic and classical Greek canon (Sappho, the tragedians), rather than on the Hellenistic and later neoteric works. Why do you choose to translate the things you do?
Anne Carson: i like concision and drive in a writer
the Hellenistic authors give me a sense of amplitude and drift
 
THC: What's it like to be a woman working in the field of Classics?
AC: when i do Classics i belong to a third gender, the clear one
 
THC: “Antigonick,” as printed, is very clearly meant to be a physical object of beauty in addition to a work of literature. When you were working on it, did you intend it for performance, which divorces it from the physical object?
AC: i didn't think about staging it, but i did think about the sound of the language and making the lines sayable
there is a small theatre inside the mind that i aim at (i think) when i write lines of verse drama
beyond that i have no theatrical imagination
 
THC: Do you have any recommendations for the students who are putting on “Antigonick” here at Harvard?
AC: no screaming
 
THC: Do you frequently encounter the question, "Why are the classics important?” and what is your response?
AC: usually in the form "how can we the Classics relevant to people today" and my thought is, how can we make ourselves relevant to them
 
THC: Do you find that the loss of classical knowledge in the general public affects how you write?
AC: yes, i need to explain more. explanation however is a deep and democratic thing, i can a lot from explaining things that seemed obvious
 
THC: To return briefly to “Antigonick”: in your version of the play, you depart fairly radically from Sophocles' text; however, in your translation of Sappho, your approach is very literal, even reflecting the spacing of individual words on the papyri fragments in your translation. Why the difference in treatment?
AC: i am never sure what anyone means by "literal"
but in fact the treatment of Sappho (spacing etc) is not any kind of replica of the original but a conceptual gesture toward the fact of fragmentation and the changing power of time
a translation is a folding of the original, a fold within a fold or unfolding to the following fold
i don't think Antigonick "departs" from the original so much as unfolds it in a way it hadn't been before
Hegel and Beckett are part of the original in the way that the inside of a fold is just the inside of the outside of the fold
 
THC: In the case of Sappho, do you anticipate returning to “If Not, Winter,” should new fragments come to light?
AC: no i don't like going back
 
THC: What projects or interests are you involved with now? Any hints about things in the pipeline for which we should keep an eye out?
AC: i have given up writing for a while
and doing drawings instead
 
THC: Is there anything else you'd like to mention?
AC: i always like to mention Homer 
 
Ianthe Demos is the artistic director of the One Year Lease Theater Company, an ensemble-based experimental theater in New York. She is directing the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Anne Carson’s “Antigonick,” which debuted on Friday and will be being performed through this Sunday. 
 
The Harvard Crimson: How is this production different from ones you’ve done before?
Ianthe Demos: It’s a take on an ancient Greek tragedy that’s not only untraditional…. She [Anne Carson] takes an ancient Greek tragedy and comments on it in a very modern, a very Anne Carson way—it deviates, it goes into poetics, it goes into Hegel, it goes into Beckett, and it goes into, I think, something very personal for her and her understanding of the story of “Antigone.” And as such, it’s as if you were in Anne Carson’s head when reading “Antigone”…. I think it’s one of those unproduceable plays.
 
THC: Do you try to translate the physical aspects of “Antigonick”—the illustrations, the hand-lettering—to the stage somehow, and if so, how?
ID: Yes, I have tried to translate what those images evoke for me to the stage somehow. Not translating the images as such, because I don’t believe in any theatrical work that what you’re doing is taking what’s on the page and trying to make it happen; you’re interpreting it, and so it is an interpretation of those images as well. That said, what do those images evoke for each of us? For me, they evoke this sense of vastness, this sense of the smallness of our existence in this vast universe, and yet perhaps the anger, the grief, the frustration, and also the humor that comes in that, when we can kind of understand a little bit about our place in this vastness, how it is laughable in one sense.
 
THC: Do you try to reach behind Anne Carson to Sophocles, or are you just interacting with the text as Carson presents it?
ID: I think you’re always trying to reach back, because she’s reaching back. I think one of the points of her text is this idea of how the ancient fuses into our modern understanding of the world, and that what’s inescapable about “Antigone” is the recurrence, not in a cyclical fashion, but… in that the same story plays out in different versions. So I think Carson taps back into it, and I think as a result, we can’t help but tap back into it. So one of the things I’ve played with—who knows if it’s successful or not—is at times to go toward what I think is very traditional staging and then blow it up.
 
THC: What made you want to do “Antigonick” in the first place?
ID: That it was impossible. That it was absolutely a challenge for me, that I think when we approach things for the stage we should always be challenging ourselves, and also that I was compelled by it.… It was that terrifying moment of “I have no idea of what I would do with this—so let’s give it a shot.”

It is rare to see lost art come alive before your very eyes, but the Boston Ballet performs such a resurrection in this season’s revival of the 1877 classic Russian ballet “La Bayadère.” Beyond the ballet’s most famous scene, “The Kingdom of the Shades,” which has become a staple in the classical ballet repertoire, the show itself has been widely forgotten by most Western audiences. The Boston Ballet’s rendition of the somewhat less-famous piece in its entirety was a successful revival that brings it back into the modern era. The production runs through November 3.
 The story follows Nikiya, the beautiful, virginal bayadère, or temple dancer, who has sworn her eternal love to Solor, the strong, handsome warrior. Solor is betrothed to the Rajah’s daughter Gamzatti, and the evil High Brahmin, smitten by Nikiya, schemes to keep her for himself. In a traditional plotline, the High Brahmin tries to kill Solor and Gamzatti fights Nikiya for Solor’s affection.  
While the plot is not especially striking, the Boston Ballet’s portrayal of it takes an unconventional and stylized approach. The ballet is set in ancient India, and this Eastern influence permeates all aspects of the show, transforming this routine tale into a fantastical journey. 
As with any ethnic-inspired performance, the show toes a fine line between tasteful nods to foreign cultures and racist reappropriations. For the most part, the Boston Ballet successfully navigates this tenuous dichotomy and uses nontraditional lines, movements, and motifs to make this lesser-known ballet relevant.
 The most unusual and iconoclastic aspect of the performance is the unusual lines of the dancers’ bodies. Classical ballet is known for its clear, straight lines, where dancer’s arms and legs hit perfectly straight diagonals across the space. However, the choreographer of Bayadère, Florence Clerc uses Oriental-inspired arms to stylize the movement, giving the show a whimsical and ethereal quality. While this incorporation of non-Western dance technique is not unique to the show itself, Clerc’s interpretation of the theme was particularly memorable.
One of the most common and striking motifs in Clerc’s choreography is the flexed mudra hand. Rather than traditional splayed or relaxed ballet hands, throughout the show, Clerc has dancers hit a flexed-wrist, mudra position, where dancers touch their thumb to index finger. This subtle variation on the traditional ballet line is a simple yet effective nod to the show’s East Asian inspiration and reminds the audience of its whimsical and foreign nature. 
Clerc also incorporates more contemporary fluid arm motions into the choreography, which she masterfully uses to extend the show’s otherworldly feel in a way that is more suggestive of modern dance than classical ballet. One of the best examples of this is the Fakir’s dance, where the temple slaves gather around the sacred fire. While the fire itself is never shown, the dancers lean into full back bends and wave their arms, visually representing the flames in a beautifully organic way. 
Prima ballerina Lia Cirio also uses unconventional arm motions to extend the ballet’s ethereal feel. Her first entrance and solo as Nikiya are marked by simple choreography consisting of slow turns and bourrées. Clerc uses this uncomplicated choreography to draw the audience’s attention to Cirio’s smooth, undulating arms. These nontraditional lines also come back in Cirio’s pas de deux in Act II. As Cirio turns into an attitude, rather than raising her hands into the traditional fifth position, she laces her arms into an elegant swan dive, prayer position and slowly leans into a full ponché.
Visually, one of the most iconic moments of “La Bayadère” is the Golden Idol solo, here performed by Jeffrey Cirio. While the dance is barely three minutes long, it is by far one of the most striking and memorable pieces in the show. Cirio enters with Clerc’s flexed mudra hand positions and full gold body paint, which is reminiscent of depictions of East Asian deities. With phenomenal stage presence, he executes a series of breathtaking leaps and turns, starting with a powerful succession of turning double sous de chats, a quad tour, and ending with a series of rotating stag leaps. Throughout his solo, Cirio also hits several very sharp flexed-wrist mudra positions, further connecting the dance to the show’s overall Oriental motif. 
However, “La Bayadère’s” costumes and makeup choices often play to racist tropes and fail to parallel the choreography’s subtle and tasteful references to East Asian cultures. The High Brahmin, the ballet’s main antagonist, is given slanted eyes, high cheekbones, a bald head, and long flowing robes—in short, nothing more than the horrendously racist Fu Manchu stereotype. Another number features a corps of what the show refers to as “Indian” dancers, all of whom wear ostentatiously fringed and feathered outfits and headdresses, which reappropriates the anachronistic Native American trope. Several performers have also darkened their skin in a blackface-esque manner, all of which feels inherently racially insensitive. 
For the most part, the show successfully combines unconventional techniques to take a fresh spin on the choreography and revive this forgotten ballet. Clerc’s clever use of East Asian-inspired gestural phrases and motions challenges the classical ballet repertoire and ties the choreography together in a cohesive and elegantly iconoclastic fashion. Despite its off-putting racial caricatures, the Boston Ballet successfully brings this lesser-known show back to the forefront.

If a person were to pick up a copy of “Antigonick,” by Anne Carson, the cover will say it is a translation of Sophocles’s “Antigone.” The script of “Antigonick,” however, is more than a translation; it is an interpretation intertwined with artistic renderings, an odd mix between a graphic novel and a lyrical retelling—more a contained, visual experience than a traditional read. For those reasons, the text does not exactly lend itself to a theatrical production. However, Ianthe Demos, this year’s Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club visiting director, is able to capture successfully the eccentricities of the text through her brilliant direction, which is reinforced by her actors’ admirable commitment to their roles.
The premise of the play is simple enough. Antigone (Laura J. A. Trosser ’16), the daughter of Oedipus, buries her brother’s body, although it is decreed unlawful, and Kreon (Max R. McGillivray ’16), the king of Thebes, sentences her to death. Each character is inextricably connected to another, and each action comes to affect the life of another character. Demos’s staging highlights the interconnectedness as the characters move together. When Kreon and Antigone debate about the tenets of justice they walk in opposition to each other: when Kreon moves left, Antigone moves right and so forth. The characters are not independent, for they are subject to fate, and their movement hints at this by not being entirely under their control. When Eurydice (Mariel N. Pettee ’14) is revealed, she is strapped to a white wall, spread like a starfish. She is a true victim of her circumstances, and so she is incapable of action and cannot engage, at least initially.
“We are standing in the nick of time,” says the Chorus after Tiresias prophesizes Kreon’s ruin. Time is like a viper in Demos’s “Antigonick”; it strikes quickly and effectively, leaving its victim wounded as it slithers away. A decision made in a split second can lead to disastrous consequences. The use of sound best indicates the disjointedness and ephemerality of time by giving it a sonic presence. In the scene where Kreon and Antigone are arguing about justice, the sound of a clock’s tick-tock accompanies their movement, simulating the hands of a clock. A sharp slicing sound, quick and vicious, indicates scene transitions, and the quietness afterwards is treated with reverence. Sound also punctures and emphasizes words. “Antigone is a person in love with the impossible,” complains Ismene (Alona Bach ’16), Antigone’s sister. The ball that they pass to each other in many of the scenes is thrown with more force on “impossible,” giving it a poignant resonance. In a landscape of silence, these sharp instances of sound carry the words of the play.
The play excels in contrasts, highlighting the absurdity of Antigone’s situation as well as the emotional highs and lows. The set design by Daniel J. Prosky ’16 particularly brings this out: it is distinctly desolate with its bluish-gray tones and sparse set pieces. At the center of the stage lies a circle that can be separated into smaller pieces, and surrounding that are broken parts of walls. The stage is at the same time contained and open, an effect created by both the set design and the the lighting by Max B. Schaffer ’17. At a particularly climactic scene, Kreon races to retrieve Antigone from her death sentence, and the play oddly devolves into a rendition of Judy Garland’s “Get Happy.” The hue of the stage becomes red, contrasting with the previous blue, and the cast crowds the stage’s empty space with dance. This stark emotional switch highlights the apparent wrongness of Antigone’s situation—the contrast in staging and lighting is sometimes drastically different from scene to scene.
McGillivray and Trosser’s successful interpretations of their characters help underscore the emotional gravitas of the play. It is not that either actor brings a particularly unique take to their respective characters, but that they fine-tune and master each character’s most salient traits to perfection. McGillivray’s Kreon is every bit the man-child king, full of the rage and vice that the part calls for. Likewise, Trosser’s Antigone is proud and valiant as she discusses Hegel and clashes with Kreon over the injustice done to her brother.
Demos’s rendition of Carson’s “Antigonick” is dense and probably requires another viewing to gather all of its intricacies. This is not a fault, but rather a testament to the play’s success in bringing the richness of the text to stage. Retaining its classic roots while being innovative in its own right, Demos’s “Antigonick” is a crowning achievement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“Harvard isn’t always the glossy ivy-covered utopia that many conceive it to be. There are moments of that place, yes. Walking past Memorial Church in the fall with reds and oranges on the ground around you, the first warm day in the spring when students on blankets adorn the Yard. Brochure Harvard does exist. The reality of the situation, however, is that this is not the Harvard that many students must wake up to and battle every single day. It is not always a place where conversations about mental health are necessarily encouraged.”
Penned for The Crimson two years ago by an anonymous student, the essay from which this excerpt originates brought campus-wide attention to certain realities about mental health at Harvard, serving as the catalyst for a wave of discussions among faculty and students about the issue. A similar anonymous op-ed published just last semester, "In Sight, Out of Mind" further highlighted what many construed to be unsympathetic policies and a lack of accessibility to mental health resources at Harvard, spurring additional conversation about mental health services and reform. Student response to these pieces was overwhelming—from an impromptu rally outside Massachusetts Hall to a town hall event sponsored by the Undergraduate Council, mental health quickly rose to the forefront of campus discussion.
Active in the effort to raise awareness of mental health issues have been Harvard’s artists—for instance, spoken word organization Harvard Speak Out Loud has hosted an annual mental health open mic for the past three years. Other artists have sought to generate awareness about the subject by creating public installations around campus.
Through a variety of different disciplines, the arts have collectively provided Harvard students with an outlet for creative self-expression, allowing them to explore issues of mental health in safe spaces and with a freedom of expression that allows for emotional catharsis. One campus artist who has utilized art to generate discussion about mental health, Bex H. Kwan ’14, sees the two as inseparable: “What is art not on mental health issues?”
THE TORTURED ARTIST
The arts have long found themselves linked to mental health, especially due to the myth of the tortured artist that perpetuates a certain stereotype about artists and the creative process. Critics across the world have praised the works of Boston-born poet Sylvia Plath, yet her infamous suicide is as well known as her seminal novel “The Bell Jar.” Writer David Foster Wallace, who similarly suffered from depression throughout his life, committed suicide at the age of 46 and has often been referred to as a literary genius—but one whose tortured brilliance was prematurely terminated. Even the post-Impressionist master Vincent van Gogh is popularly recognized as having struggled with mental illness, his prolific career cut short by a self-inflicted gunshot wound at age 37. Already larger-than-life figures, these artists have gained a greater air of mystery due to their tumultuous lives.
Although it may be tempting to characterize artists as solitary individuals manifesting inner distress in their artwork, student artists argue that this romanticization of mental illness trivializes depression and misrepresents the artistic process. English concentrator Jennifer T. Soong ’14, an inactive Crimson Arts writer, thinks that mental illness and the creative process are often erroneously conflated. “I see [them] as very separate things. I think it’s very dangerous to superimpose [them], and I don’t think there’s anything romantic about either one, and especially not the two together,” Soong says. “Mental health is just your mental state, which is your way of being.”
For last year’s Arts First festival, Soong collaborated with psychology concentrator My Ngoc C. To ’15 on plans for a public art installation that would provoke students to think more introspectively about their lives. Titled “Mental Space,” the piece was conceived as a large spiral structure in the middle of Harvard Yard. “The walls would be covered with objects that people would bring to the spiral, to show the emotional topography of Harvard students,” To says. The two assembled a team of artists and even established an official student organization called Harvard College Mental Space, which allowed them to secure grant funding from various sources. “We wanted it to be a public art project because mental health issues are often such an isolated phenomenon,” she says. “Having something so private be put in a public space where everyone could interact with it would help stimulate some more dialogue.” However, bureaucratic hurdles involving the construction of such a large piece ultimately stonewalled the project, and it was never completed.
Before “Mental Space,” To also worked on another installation in Pforzheimer House consisting of full-length mirrors placed in common areas. Each mirror was labeled “This is what depression looks like” and covered with sticky notes representing common stigmas such as “Depression is the result of a character flaw.” As students walked past the mirrors, they were encouraged to remove sticky notes, literally peeling away the stigmas surrounding depression, until only an uncovered mirror remained. “I think that art is a really powerful way of moving people, and sometimes it takes something like art to really understand what mental illness is like,” To says.
Mental health remains a deeply personal subject for To, who has previously struggled with depression. “Being depressed, it sinks you in such lows that normally you wouldn’t be able to comprehend, so you see a darkness that is beyond what normal life is like, and that’s something that’s very powerful,” To says. She ultimately took a gap year as a result of her mental illness. During this time, she wrote a memoir titled “The Washing Room,” which describes her experiences with suicide and psychiatric care and frames them within the context of her Vietnamese-American background. Her book, which was published this year, was exhibited in the 2013 Boston Book Festival.
For To, writing was both a healing process and a way to move on. "Writing about my experiences really helped for me to turn a painful experience into something that was much more than that—into a work of art,” she says. “Being able to write my story and frame it into a book with a happy ending is really therapeutic." However, To decries the trope of the tortured artist, stating that depression in no way fueled her writing process. “I think that creativity and mental illness are completely separate things. I feel even more creative now that I'm healthy and on top of things.”
 
MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD 
On a Friday evening in mid-October of this year, students gather in Boylston Hall’s Ticknor Lounge. The room’s comfortable red armchairs have been rearranged into a semicircle, and students sit facing the chalkboard at the center of the room. A solitary microphone stands at this stage, under dim yellow lighting that complements the warm wood paneling of the lounge. More groups of students enter and make themselves comfortable on the floor or a windowsill as Harvard Speak Out Loud’s mental health open mic, “Words on the Mind,” begins.
For the third year in a row, “Words on the Mind” has drawn an ever larger and more varied audience. Representatives from all five undergraduate peer-counseling groups are also present in addition to staff from Student Mental Health Services. The audience itself is a veritable cross-section of the College, with some attendees never having been to a spoken word event before. One student rises to describe her struggle with identity as a woman of color; another laments the isolation engendered by the superficiality of social interactions on campus. The sheer passion and raw emotion pouring forth from each speaker is a testament to the community that Speak Out Loud has established. Maura D. Church ’14, a member of the organization’s board, considers these events a supportive forum for student self-expression. “This can be a positive space and a space for mental health and art to kind of be joined in a positive way. It may not necessarily be a certain kind of emotion that’s generating the art or generating the poem, but the space is framed in a way that allows any kind of art to happen,” Church says.
Cassandra E. Euphrat Weston ’14, current member and former co-president of Speak Out Loud, appreciates the openness of the space in encouraging audience members to share their experiences. “People come and tell stories that they didn’t plan to share, but they were sitting in the audience and they feel moved to share something, and all of these kinds of sharing tend to be very personal and brave, and it’s a beautiful space every year,” Euphrat Weston says. “I think that each person approaches their art and this topic in their own way, and our hope is that people find this a healing space. I’ve also had friends tell me personally either that they [found] or they expect[ed] to find it a triggering space.”
A speaker will occasionally preface their piece with the phrase “trigger warning,” cautioning the audience that the deeply personal nature of the forthcoming content may serve as an emotional trigger. Yet everything that is shared—from stories about physical and emotional insecurities to encounters with depression and suicide to commentaries about Harvard in general—is affecting not only because of its content, but also because each vignette resonates with the audience members and their own personal experiences. Particularly insightful moments are met with a chorus of snaps from listeners.
“This is a great way to make the issue visible, make the help visible, and make the fact that there’s a supportive, strong community that’s willing to listen also visible as well,” Church says. In addition to open mics, Speak Out Loud also runs weekly workshops, which are open to all students and encourage conversation about any subject. The workshop before this year’s “Words on the Mind” featured conversation about mental health issues, balancing this heavier topic with a corresponding focus on the benefits of self-care.
Current co-president Oluwaseun L. Animashaun ’14 sees workshops as a way in which the organization promotes discussion about important issues through writing and sharing. “I definitely think now—with the structures we have in place—that people can actually not only take what they’ve heard and talk about it with their roommates, but also use that to create art in their own right.”
“A MORE ANALYTICAL LENS”
For Kwan, art is simultaneously a reflection of personal experience and a cerebral process that provokes thought in both the artist and the audience. Last fall, Kwan worked on a show titled “Counterpoint” at the Loeb Drama Center Mainstage, a collaboration between the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company and the Harvard Ballet Company. Kwan’s piece, “Safe Space,” channeled dance to discuss sexual assault on campus.
With the piece, Kwan hoped to raise certain questions about a subject that often goes undiscussed: “What does it mean to feel safe on campus? What does it mean to create something that ensures someone’s safety? Is that even possible? Those kinds of issues,” Kwan says. In the spring, Kwan also worked with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response and the Harvard College Women’s Center to produce an experimental show called “Yes or No?” at the Agassiz Theatre that explored similar themes.
To Kwan, these performances were meant to intellectually examine deeply personal issues and engage the audience in important dialogues. While acknowledging the raw emotional power of events such as the mental health open mic, Kwan also see a place for more structured investigations of the same ideas. “When you listen to a poem that is someone pouring their heart out in terms of their emotional experience, hopefully the audience has a visceral reaction to that. But then, when you see something thoughtful, that looks at something through a more analytical lens, hopefully the audience thinks about that too,” Kwan says.
 
Perhaps the greatest strength of Harvard’s arts community is its solidarity. Although every individual approaches the issue of mental health from a different perspective, the community hopes to be an accessible way to address difficult issues. Artists often explore deeply personal and sensitive topics, and their artwork provides a powerful medium from which discussions can originate. As students increasingly call for mental health reform and dialogue, Kwan views art as an essential tool for catalyzing the changes many want to see. “[Art] has the power to make the audience think and feel, and both at the same time—and hopefully in the future, do.”

Oh, Ryan Murphy. You try so hard.
 
Murphy has had quite an interesting career trajectory—he’s the creator of a varied assortment of shows including “Nip/Tuck,” “Glee,” “American Horror Story,” and “The New Normal.” Also, he’s crazy. Besides the not-so-dearly departed “The New Normal,” Murphy’s shows are notable for their off the wall, crazy plot developments, outrageous characters, and nonsensical story arcs.

Take “Glee” for instance. Poor, poor, “Glee.” I remember being in high school when the promise of “Glee” was so exciting—a musical TV show with kids singing everything from Lady Gaga to "Cabaret!" It’s funny to look back now and see the naiveté. The schtick was endearing for maybe a season—okay, Lea Michele is talented; Matthew Morrison plays the worst teacher alive who nevertheless means well; Jane Lynch is quite funny—but it soon devolved into a mess of faux-"KidzBop" pageantry, glitter, and feelings.
 
This leads us to what is arguably the most commercially and critically successful cog in the Ryan Murphy machine, “American Horror Story” (or “Jessica Lange is Fabulous and There Are Also Monsters I Guess”). Season one, retroactively titled “Murder House,” was an abject disaster and, to me, indicative of the problems that still plague this improved but still confounding show. “Murder House” had no sense of self—it fell victim to Murphy’s “throw everything on the wall and hope something sticks” approach to television.
 
However, there was one bright spot in this muddy mess—the queen of the Southern drawl (her Blanche DuBois is legendary), Jessica Lange. Playing Constance, the neighbor from hell, Lange gave pedigree and critical clout to a floundering freshman show. And Murphy is particularly lucky she did, because her Emmy and Golden Globe-winning turn led the show to be picked up for a second, vastly improved season, entitled “Asylum.” This was the show “AHS” had been striving to be since the beginning—moody and atmospheric, with hearty injections of camp (“The Name Game” anyone?) and legitimate frights.
 
Now we are well into the third season, called “Coven,” and I’m worried. The show seems to be back to its old tricks, throwing plot points around nonsensically and hoping something is shocking enough to cause dramatic tension. The shock-and-awe approach, so ingrained in the sense of place and time of “Asylum,” is proving to be a downfall to “Coven.” Just in the last episode alone, plots involving religious fanaticism, incest, and bestiality were all introduced, while a key character was killed off. And the narrative is… what, exactly? The conflict between Lange and Angela Bassett’s characters? It’s remarkable that three episodes in I really can’t tell you what the show is about. I can pick out lots of insane moments, but nothing really tied to the forward action of the plot (something that “Asylum” excelled at)—just moments.
 
Murphy’s rather eclectic group of TV shows is perhaps indicative of the type of person he is. So here’s hoping that the erratic creator and his team can figure out what story they’re trying to tell—and if it involves Lange and Patti LuPone having an angry, belty duet together, all will be forgiven.

Sunday was a satisfying day in Massachusetts; apart from the Red Sox’s strong and decisive sixth inning against the Cardinals in the 2013 World Series, Massachusetts ranked first among the states in academic performance in a U.S. global education study. But Sunday was also a somber one; another study from Northeastern University found that income inequality in Massachusetts is both greater than ever before and worse than the nation at large.
Massachusetts has distinguished itself as a knowledge-based economy, serving as a hub of many industries like biotechnology and finance, which demand a class of skilled and educated workers. Given its participation at the vanguard of many technical fields, it is unsurprising that the educated and elite have little difficulty finding well-compensating jobs. But when this comes at the cost of leaving blue-collared workers behind, it is unacceptable. As a state renowned for its premier educational opportunities, the Commonwealth should focus on expanding the reach of its educational excellence to the low-income, low-education workers who, as the study suggests, are being left on the sidelines in this period of rapid development.
A reason for this growing gap probably comes from the wide variation in educational attainment and graduation rates among the communities in Massachusetts, where low-income districts see much lower graduation rates. Students in low-income areas aren’t being offered the support and resources necessary to earn degrees in a knowledge economy, and effort needs to be made to change that. Based on the successes of the Turnaround program in places like Lawrence and Salem, we see promise in the Turnaround model and other programs like it.
Another contributing factor to this growing disparity between the rich and poor is the growing disparity in the quality of different post-secondary opportunities. While Massachusetts is the home of many elite, private universities, graduation rates in its community colleges are below the national average. Even in Massachusetts, many jobs only require two-year degrees rather than four-year degrees. The Commonwealth would benefit by seriously considering the allocation of resources toward improving its community college system, as put forth by the Boston Foundation. By making associate’s degrees more available to the workforce, particularly those who wouldn’t otherwise attend four-year accredited schools, Massachusetts could begin bridging the achievement gap.
In a knowledge-based economy, education is the key to financial mobility, and educational equality—which can exist both at the secondary level with programs like Turnaround and at the post-secondary level with a stronger community college system—is the key to minimizing the achievement gap. By ensuring that premier education is available not just from premier institutions, Massachusetts can race ahead in all its hot industries without racing away from a large number of its workers.

As you might know, this past week was Sex Week. Harvard College Munch hosted events. Free vibrators abounded. But this past week was also “White Ribbon Against Pornography Week,” a series of events hosted by—among others—the Anscombe Society. WRAP week was seemingly planned as a sort of protest of Sex Week, an “alternative” to it, and included events with titles such as “Collateral Damage: How Pornography Affects Women” and “Hookup Culture: Slavery or Freedom?” Beyond the highly offensive terminology of these titles, they underline the Anscombe Society’s long and strange history of pretending that it is fundamentally acting in women’s interests.
Back when I was a first-year student and it was still called “True Love Revolution,” I remember being drawn to a table at the activities fair with a sign that promised “true feminism!” and then jetting away like a speed demon once I was informed that “true feminism” involved lots of abstinence and probably housework. The group has continued, over the years, to speak out against abortion availability, deny that genderqueer people exist, and bring speakers to campus to bemoan the evils of hook-up culture, all under the guise of “women’s rights.”
So their choice of pornography as a topic for a week-long event does not seem surprising: an opposition to pornography is often espoused in feminist circles, and the desire to paint various kinds of sex workers as victims and only victims is something that is present both on the left and on the right. And from liberal Nicholas D. Kristof ’81’s New York Times column that explores the evils of sex trafficking (not to say that this isn’t an awful reality that needs to be addressed) to right-wing depictions of the sex-worker-as-victim, popular discussions of sex work are very one-sided and tend to deny sex workers across the board—be they prostitutes or porn stars—any agency. In reality, there are, of course, porn stars happy with what they do. Pornography is a fascinating issue to discuss, but it cannot be productively discussed if we write it off as evil from the start.
So WRAP Week, with its pat regurgitations of conservative norms, makes all too clear the fact that the need for nuanced discussion around issues like pornography and sex is real. And though I do think that Sex Week provides a necessary pushback against such conservatism, I am interested in questioning the way that it pushes back, and in examining the sex positivity that pervades the entire week.
The question of sex positivity has a fraught history within feminist and queer movements. For decades, the political left and many strains of feminism in particular have adhered fast to a certain discourse: Our sexualities as women and queer individuals are repressed, and we need to free them. Furthermore, sexuality is a part of every person’s identity, and it holds a certain truth about us that we must reconcile ourselves with in order to be our fullest selves. With this sort of discourse, however, often comes certain imperatives—you must want to talk about sex; if you are uncomfortable talking about sex or listening to others talk about sex, your discomfort is a useful and productive kind of discomfort, and it should teach you to change your ways.
I would argue that this is not necessarily a useful sort of discomfort, and that aiming toward a world where everyone is completely comfortable talking about sex isn’t necessarily an essential or important goal. Aversions to discussing sex can indeed be heavily colored by homophobia, misogyny, and other sorts of oppressive ways of approaching the world, and these cases are, of course, political and legitimate sites for change-making.
But for some, talking about sex—across the board, no matter the form, no matter the iteration—just makes them uncomfortable, and no one has the right to tell those people that this is not okay, or that it’s something they have to work on. For some survivors of sexual assault, being expected to talk about and be deeply comfortable with issues surrounding sex can be alienating and triggering. Sex-positive doctrines also punish and goad people who are uncomfortable talking about sex for religious reasons. And then there are those for whom sex is relatively unrelated to their personal conceptions of themselves, and talking about sex is not a site of liberation, usefulness, or interest.
So as much as WRAP clearly requires a response and a pushback, I find myself surprised to be saying that I think Sex Week might need a pushback, too—to a much, much smaller degree, of course, and coming from a very different direction. We need to think critically about the usefulness of discomfort, and the relationship between the personal and political dimensions of talking about sex. Attending Sex Week events was entirely optional, but the sort of unflagging sex positivity that pervaded the week is definitely not optional in many feminist and left-of-center circles—and we certainly shouldn’t let WRAP Week be the alternative for those made uncomfortable by the giant vagina outside the science center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wracked by recent debates on the decline of academic integrity and deficiencies in mental health services, Harvard is in a period of soul-searching. At the center of all this existential introspection is Harvard’s overworked student body. Crushed under the weight of demanding course loads and extracurricular activities, most Harvard students would admit that, at least once, they have questioned the meaning of their toil—or wondered whether their efforts are truly worth it all. As a recent Crimson column explains, Harvard students may be more likely to struggle with “certain basic issues of existence: mortality, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness.” For a potential answer to our existential woes, we should look to the writings of the absurdist philosopher Albert Camus.
In his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus recounts the story of the mortal Sisyphus—condemned by the gods to roll a stone up a mountain for all eternity. Every time Sisyphus reaches the summit, the stone rolls back down, forcing Sisyphus to begin the task again. Faced with a seemingly endless cycle of problem sets, papers, and midterms, many Harvard students can relate to Sisyphus’s plight. The completion of each week’s assignments signals only a brief reprieve until the proverbial stone rolls back down and the assault of the next week’s work begins. And when the work piles up and stress builds, finishing yet another paper can seem as meaningless and frustrating as pushing a stone up a mountain. Indeed, Camus saw the fate of “the workman of today, [who] works every day in his life at the same tasks…[as] no less absurd” than that of Sisyphus.
For the industrious Greeks, Sisyphus’s punishment was the ultimate torment—a meaningless task with no hope of completion (many Harvard students, with their Alexandrian ambitions and Stoic work ethics, might concur with this viewpoint). Sisyphus was a pitiable figure, an object lesson for those who dared defy the gods.
Camus, however, had a different perspective. As an absurdist, Camus believed that human beings seek meaning in existence, yet the universe is inherently meaningless, indifferent to this need. In Camus’s view, Sisyphus was the archetypal absurdist hero—burdened by this meaningless task and facing an uncaring universe, Sisyphus acknowledges and accepts the absurdity of his fate.
For Camus, this acceptance is crucial. At Harvard, many of us feel indignant or resentful when life seems unfair or when the burden we carry—personal, academic, or otherwise—grows too heavy. Yet when Camus’s Sisyphus makes the long walk down the slope to retrieve his stone, he is not sad. On the contrary, Sisyphus is at peace. Left by fate with no other options, Sisyphus revolts in the only way he can—by accepting his absurd situation, joyfully shouldering his burden and making his ascent once again. In Camus’s famous words, “one must imagine Sisyphus happy.”
I don’t agree with Camus’s assertion that life is totally meaningless—after all, we are all at Harvard to pursue meaningful personal, intellectual, and professional goals. Nor do I think that the work and toil of our everyday lives, however Sisyphean, is inherently meaningless. Nonetheless, Camus’s conclusion remains rather profound. Sisyphus’s acceptance of his fate has a certain nobility—his eternal struggle against fate gives us inspiration when the universe seems arranged against us. Regardless of whether we choose to accept the absurd, or if we believe that life has inherent meaning, the lesson of Sisyphus is that when we feel as if the universe is indifferent or uncaring, the best response may be to happily accept this injustice and move on.
Indeed, it is inevitable in the hustle and bustle of life at Harvard that we’ll occasionally lose sight of the greater meaning in our lives. It is precisely in these moments of desperation that we should heed Sisyphus’s example. So next time you shoulder that burden and prepare to climb that academic hill, crack a smile. Laugh in the face of a silent universe indifferent to your lack of sleep, your stress level, or the fact that you haven’t left the library all day. Faced with the absurdity of a 15-page paper due the next week, it’s your best means of revolt.

Another Halloween comes around, another Heaven and Hell, another Sweet and Nasty, and amid these festivities, we miss another opportunity to discuss the racial implications behind students’ choices in Halloween costumes. In recent years, college students around the country have initiated dialogue and action regarding offensive Halloween costumes. We would like to encourage our fellow students at Harvard to join the movement this year: Choose respect over insensitive humor when assembling your costumes. Even more importantly, take this opportunity to educate yourself. Engage in dialogue about why certain costumes can be perceived as offensive and how humor and caricature have historically been used to perpetuate racial and cultural stereotypes. In other words, we would like our campus to discuss how Halloween costumes can serve as mechanisms for cultural appropriation.
According to the blog Unsettling America, cultural appropriation can be defined as “the adoption or theft of icons, rituals, aesthetic standards, and behavior from one culture or subculture by another [generally] when the subject culture is a minority culture. This ‘appropriation’ often occurs without any real understanding of why the original culture took part in these activities or the meanings behind these activities.”
Western culture has a history of finding entertainment in mocking and perpetuating stereotypes of oppressed groups (refer to the history of blackface) and selling products by depicting minority cultures as exotic, edgy, and desirable (see Urban Outfitters’ use of the Navajo name and Victoria Secret’s Sexy Little Geisha lingerie).  When you dress in blackface or a Native American headdress for Halloween, you’re placing yourself in association with a history of Western imperialism, slavery, and violence against minority groups. When you dress as “ghetto fab,” as a “redneck,” or as an “illegal alien,” you’re mocking the racial and socioeconomic inequalities in our society and appropriating what you think is minority culture for your one night of fun.
 
We can already hear the objections:
“But I didn’t personally contribute to the oppression of these minority groups and I don’t mean any harm.” The fact that you didn’t intend it to does not mean that your costume can’t offend others. By wearing a costume that mimics a minority culture, you’re publicly associating yourself with the Western history of oppressing minority groups and appropriating their cultures for humor or fashion. The impact on those who see and are affected by your costume still stands. Furthermore, in a setting like a college Halloween party, you often do not even have the opportunity to explain your intentions.
“I just love (insert minority identity here) culture and I want to show my appreciation.” In the context of Western tendencies to force their own culture upon others and selectively take what they want in return, you should ask yourself if you’re coming from a place of sincere respect, humility, and mutual understanding—i.e. were you invited to partake in this cultural appreciation? You should also ask yourself whether a Halloween party is really the place to show appreciation for a culture that is sacred and deeply personal to others. Halloween costumes are largely associated with a spooky, humorous, or partying atmosphere, and we think that there are more appropriate spaces to express cultural appreciation.
“My friend is (insert minority identity here) and he doesn’t find my costume offensive.” One individual does not speak for an entire racial, cultural, or religious group. Just because one member of the group is not offended, it does not mean that another member of the group will not be.
“How come you don’t have any problems with appropriating ‘white culture’—for example, if someone wore a blonde wig and dressed up as Marilyn Monroe?” Because historically, “white culture,” defined as mainstream Western culture in this context, has not been systematically subjugated by another racial or cultural group. Because white privilege still exists in the U.S. Because whiteness is considered the norm in our society, unlike minority groups with histories of systematic oppression, exotification, and stereotyping.
We use these concepts not to intellectualize our social scene or dampen a day of seemingly harmless fun, but instead to draw connections to the historical and contemporary implications of problematic costumes. We want you to have fun, but without ruining someone else’s fun or coming across as ignorant or malicious. And don’t think that this never happens on Harvard’s campus, given that Sigma Chi’s “Conquistabros and Navajos” party controversy was only three years ago. We do not bring this issue up to point fingers, but to show that our campus is not immune from these issues.
We hope that this article serves as a starting point for more discussions regarding Halloween costumes and party culture at Harvard. We ourselves have more questions regarding issues such as costumes that “sexualize” certain professions, such as the sexy nurse, secretary, or flight attendant. To provide a space to share our experiences and perspectives, Sustained Dialogue, a student organization committed to dialogue on issues of identity and diversity, is planning a dialogue event on Halloween costumes on Tuesday, October 29 from 5 to 6:30 p.m. in Ticknor Lounge. We would love to hear your thoughts, work through ambiguities, and raise more questions together. This Halloween, we hope you choose respect, empathy, and education.

Harvard Business School’s newest addition--Tata Hall, future home for HBS’ Executive Education program--will be officially dedicated on Dec. 9 of this year, according to Andrew F. O’Brien, chief of operations at HBS and overseer of the project.
The dedication will come about two years after the construction of Tata Hall began on Dec. 5, 2011. Construction has been on or ahead of schedule since the initial development of the project began on Oct. 31, 2011, and no major construction or design plans have altered since that time, according to O’Brien. The initial estimate of the total costs were $100 million.
“Building construction work is nearing completion, with furniture installation starting this week. The exterior site improvements and landscaping work is in progress, scheduled for completion by the end of November,” O’Brien said. Additionally, development of the building’s interior mechanical, electrical, and plumbing fixtures and installation of exterior glass and window frames are ongoing, according to this week’s updated construction notice.
Tata Hall was funded by a $50 million gift from the Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group.
Due to its close proximity to other HBS facilities--Tata Hall will sit behind HBS’ central social space for meals and meetings, Kresge Hall--construction of the building has required careful attention to minimize impact on neighboring buildings.
“The location of the building adjacent to other occupied buildings on the HBS campus has created challenges in terms of controlling noise, dust, vibrations and other construction related issues,” O’Brien said, adding that these challenges were managed by meeting frequently with the construction contractor, as well as having proactive communications to inform faculty, students and staff of project’s impact on a weekly basis.
Tata Hall will comprise approximately 150,000 square feet, feature 180 bedrooms to house visiting executives, and span at least six floors, O’Brien said. It has been designed in accordance with LEED Gold certification--the second-highest sustainability rating awarded by the United States Green Building Council--and will feature triple-glazed windows and a green roof.
Members of the Executive Education program will begin using the building in January 2014, following initial occupancy by HBS staff after the dedication. The program brings together business leaders from all over the world to develop management and leadership skills.
“Tata Hall marks the shift to a new global century of business, and is a special marker as we look forward to a renewed, more interconnected world,” HBS Dean Nitin Nohria said during the 2011 unveiling ceremony of the project.

War Photographer--the award-winning 2001 documentary depicting the work of photojournalist James Nachtwey--opens with a quotation by world-renowned photographer Robert Capa: “If your pictures aren’t good enough, you're not close enough.”
Attendees at a screening of the film Monday evening in the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs had their own opportunity to zoom in on Nachtwey’s process.
The film was shown as part of Humanity Explored, a series of events that examine the role of art in human rights advocacy. The series hopes to highlight artistic representations of major human rights challenges and abuses, and places a particular focus on current humanitarian crises, according to Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Executive Director Vincenzo Bollettino.
“We’re looking at other ways that art is used, both for expressing trauma, coping with it, and researching it,” he said. The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative co-hosted the screening with the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard and the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at HKS.
The documentary describes the field of photojournalism and then transitions into the details of Nachtwey’s experiences in a number of warzones, including post-war Kosovo and Indonesia. Much of the movie is filmed by a video camera mounted on top of Nachtwey’s still camera, giving the viewer a unique perspective into the choices Nachtwey makes as he shoots photographs of the gruesome effects of war on daily life.
“What’s really interesting about the film is it provides a bird’s eye view...you see the decisions of what he chooses to shoot and what ends up in mass media,” said Sarah Peck, administrative and fellows coordinator at the Carr Center. She said that Nachtwey is one of the most prominent war photographers today.
That sentiment was echoed by Gregory Marinovich, a close friend and colleague of Nachtwey who introduced the event. Marinovich is a current Nieman Fellow at Harvard and a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer who spent many years in the field with Nachtwey since first meeting him in South Africa 23 years ago.
“We’re both very humanist. It’s not what you decide to shoot but how, and how you treat the subjects around you,” he said. Nachtwey shares this ethical perspective, Marinovich added. Despite the unpredictability of the subjects they are shooting, Marinovich said Nachtwey “wants control” over the process. “He doesn’t do accidents,” he said.
“I was very deeply moved,” said Shradha Balakrishnan, a student at HKSl. “Two things that stayed with me were how they deal with fear...he channels into his work and that’s a message that a lot of us can take into our own work.”

A crowd of students gathered in the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Monday to watch a live video stream of Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 at a viewing party to launch her “Lean In on Campus Campaign.”
Co-hosted by Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business, the Harvard College Women’s Center, and The Seneca, Inc., the event engaged a room full of Harvard students as well as thousands of students from more than 150 campuses around the world through virtual connections.
“Whether it’s the local town hall to the boardroom to our schoolhouses to our Congress, our voices aren’t equally heard at those tables,” Sandberg said.
Sandberg argued that deeply ingrained gender biases have led to the gap in the number of women in high leadership positions.
“We believe men should be aggressive, assertive, speak out, decide things,” she said. “All over the world, we believe women should give to others, be communal, speak when spoken to.”
Sandberg was optimistic about the prospects of combatting gender biases, telling the audience, “You are and will be the Lean In generation, the generation that brings the promise of equality to fruition.”
She advised women to exhibit greater confidence, as women are more likely than men to attribute their success to external factors, rather than to themselves.
“When a man is successful, he will believe that it is because of his own skill,” Sandberg said. “When a woman is successful, she and other people will ascribe that success to getting lucky, help from others, and working hard.”
Sandberg also made the case for men to “lean in,” explaining that men who have a better understanding of gender biases will have more influence in the workplace and “many more marriages proposals, more dates, [and] more nights out.”
According to Sandberg, men do not hold all of the blame for gender bias---which even she admitted to being guilty of at times--but she stressed that what women need the most from men is a greater understanding of this bias.
Sandberg also advised women who were entering “the real world” to first and foremost negotiate their entry salaries to ensure they are getting the same pay as men in the same position.
Audience reaction was positive, with applause and laughter following many of Sandberg’s remarks.
“I think there are really two main purposes of Lean In. I think the first one being to raise awareness, and the second to give support,” said Jasmine Griffin ’15, one of the event’s organizers.
“We think it in our heads, but we don’t actually realize that we apply [labels like ‘bossy’ and ‘aggressive’]  to women as opposed to men,” said Sarah K. Schachman ’16, who signed up to be a Lean In leader at the event.

Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study will seek to raise $70 million in its segment of The Harvard Campaign, Radcliffe Campaign co-chair Susan S. Wallach ’68 announced Monday night at a campaign launch event in Agassiz Hall in Radcliffe Yard.
Wallach also announced that the Institute has already raised $26 million, or 37 percent of its goal. According to Radcliffe spokesperson Alison Franklin, that figure represents the sum of 8,123 gifts.
These donations to Radcliffe are counted as part of Harvard’s $6.5 billion University-wide campaign, of which Radcliffe’s goal represents a little more than 1 percent. The Institute is the third University-affiliated body to launch its fundraising drive in the last week. The School of Public Health formally launched its campaign on Thursday, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences just concluded a weekend of launch festivities.
At an address delivered at a dinner Monday night for donors and supporters in Radcliffe’s Knafel Center, Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth A. Cohen unveiled the Institute’s fundraising priorities, which emphasize collaboration across the University, increased engagement between Radcliffe fellows and Harvard students, and the diversification of the Institute’s programming and research funding.
“We must continue to support advanced study, for the sake of those eager to undertake it and for the sake of our society,” Cohen said, according to her prepared remarks.
Monday’s events began with a dedication ceremony of the Institute's public garden, now named in honor of Wallach and her husband, Kenneth L. Wallach ’68. In addition to the garden dedication, Cohen introduced several art exhibitions, which attendees viewed during a subsequent reception.
A cocktail event later in the evening featured a speech from University President Drew G. Faust as well an address by Tarik O’Regan, a composer who spent a year as a fellow at Radcliffe in 2005, and a short musical performance.
A number of prominent Harvard figures attended the event along with Faust, including FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, Harvard Corporation member Paul J. Finnegan ’75, and prolific donor Sidney R. Knafel ’52, who serves as a co-chair for the University-wide capital campaign as well as for the Radcliffe fundraising effort.
Faust, who served as Radcliffe’s first dean from 2001-2007, told the crowd of about 100 that, as President, she has not forgotten the lessons she learned while leading the Institute.
“A lot of what Radcliffe is and represents has had so much influence on how I thought about the broader University, and what it could be and what it should be,” Faust said.
She said that “One University,” a phrase referring to an interconnected, interdisciplinary campus that she and others have used to describe her vision, is a concept conceived from her work at Radcliffe.
“Bringing the strengths of the University together across many fields, many schools, many disciplines, to make each of us stronger than we would be on our own—this really became part of my understanding of what Harvard could do when I arrived here at Radcliffe,” Faust said.

Audience members at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday night watched a political advertisement in which a middle-aged man from Indiana recounted the loss of his job. Aided by sorrowful background music and black-and-white stills of a closed power plant, the man explained that 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s firm, Bain Capital, made $100 million off of his personal tragedy.
“This, to me, was the most successful political ad, not only in 2012, but in any advertising for a long time,” said Frank I. Luntz, founder and president of Luntz Global and moderator of the event.
Luntz, a Republican party strategist famous for coining phrases like “climate change” and “the death tax,” led a discussion titled, “Is This Any Way to Pick a President?”  Jim Margolis, senior advisor for the Obama 2012 campaign, and Larry C. McCarthy, media advisor for the Romney-supporting Super PAC Restore Our Future, joined the conversations about campaign advertising today.
The speakers agreed that to create effective campaign ads, strategists should listen to the public and target potential voters. Margolis explained that the Obama campaign had separate tracks of advertising to reach out to different demographic groups.
“We’re able to start relevant conversations when we know something about the person and what their concerns are,” said Margolis in an interview with The Crimson.
According to Luntz, candidates often fail to engage with the public and instead simply repeat talking points. He recalled a moment in the 2012 presidential election when Romney was asked whether a college student could find a job after graduation.
“Why didn’t [Romney] say, ‘What job do you want?’” Luntz asked. “Why didn’t he ask, ‘How many of you are nervous you won’t find a job?’ The camera would’ve zoomed out on everyone raising their hands.”
Luntz said that both candidates failed to take advantage of the opportunity for reciprocal communication.
“You’re in a town hall, ask people a question!” he said. “Are you so arrogant that you can’t do that?”
The talk turned to the ubiquity of negative advertising.
“People say over and over that they don’t like negative ads,” said McCarthy, who produced the infamous 1988 Willy Horton attack ad. “But you see in focus groups and data that they respond to them.”
The speakers expressed regret about the current state of political advertising and discourse.
“When politicians do town hall meetings, they’re taking their lives into their hands,” Luntz said. “People stand in the back and start screaming the moment the candidate starts. They’re not listening to anything being said.”
Margolis agreed. “We’ve lost the ability to have conversations with any sort of moderation, and that’s reflected in Congress and on our news channels,” he said.
Yet Margolis also expressed hope for the future of campaign advertising. “When we get people involved in campaigns, their ability to inspire change can be incredible,” he said. “It’s powerful and it’s awesome.”

With kegs banned, U-Haul access restricted, and student tailgates housed on tennis courts, tailgating before this year’s Harvard-Yale football game in New Haven may look much as it does in Cambridge.
Before Harvard takes the field against the Bulldogs on Nov. 23, students will be allowed to tailgate between 8:30 a.m. and 12 p.m. at the “student tailgate village” on courts of Yale’s Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center, similar to the set-up of recent Games hosted at Harvard. Unlike at Harvard, hard alcohol is not explicitly prohibited in Yale’s Harvard-Yale Game tailgating policy, though hard alcohol is prohibited in the tailgating area, according to Yale Assistant Athletic Director Andy Dunn.
Although Harvard’s notoriously strict policies banning kegs and hard alcohol at tailgates have been in place for a number of years, The Game at Yale has traditionally been known for its more relaxed rules. But this November will mark the first time that Harvard students travel to New Haven for The Game since Yale put in place stricter tailgating policies in the wake of a U-Haul accident that resulted in a woman’s death at the 2011 Harvard-Yale game in New Haven.
In January 2012, just weeks after that accident, Yale administrators announced that they, like Harvard, would ban kegs at tailgates. The new regulations also restricted U-Haul access of the tailgate area to approved vendors and required student tailgates to end at kick-off time.
Yale’s efforts to tighten its tailgating policies have not been limited to the restrictions enacted in 2012. Prior to the November 2011 accident, Yale banned glass containers and required attendees over 21 to present IDs and wear wristbands to consume alcohol. Those regulations are still in place.
Reflecting on this year’s tailgating policies, Eliot House Committee Co-Chair  Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14 said she was concerned about the requirement that student tailgates be broken down by 1:30 p.m., just an hour and a half after the conclusion of the tailgate.
“That’s too early,” Acevedo said. “That puts a lot of burden on HoCo to clean up quickly.”
In light of this restriction, Acevedo said, “Everyone may err on the side of being more simplistic, with less decorations.”
For Harvard’s part, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich said that the Office of Student Life’s goal is to ensure that Harvard students are aware of Yale’s policies.
“We work to prepare both the students [who will be] running the tailgate or just attending the tailgate to understand what those are and to know that we have expectations that they’re going to represent Harvard well,” Friedrich said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Nov. 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that Yale’s tailgating policy for the football game against Harvard does not prohibit hard alcohol. To clarify, while the policy does not explicitly forbid hard liquor, hard alcohol is prohibited in the tailgating area, according to Yale Assistant Athletic Director Andy Dunn.

Although Boston’s mayoral candidates never appeared onstage together Monday night, both trumpeted the importance of innovation to the city’s future in two separate conversations with economics professor Edward L. Glaeser.
The two men who will face off in next Tuesday’s mayoral election, Martin J. “Marty” Walsh and John R. Connolly ’95, each spoke with Glaeser before taking questions from the audience at the hour-long event, which was held in Boston and co-sponsored by several Harvard institutes and centers. Both candidates said that under their leadership, the city government would do more to support and retain entrepreneurs and innovators.
“The next industry is innovation,” said Walsh, a former union leader and a member of state House of Representatives.
Connolly, a former public school teacher and an at-large Boston City Councilor, praised outgoing Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s efforts to support innovation, calling the Menino administration’s Seaport Innovation District initiative “one of the greatest accomplishments of the Menino administration.”
In both conversations, which also included broader discussion of the city’s economy, the candidates also put forth different ideas about how they would run City Hall. While Connolly highlighted public transportation and education, Walsh emphasized land leasing and the relationship between the City Council and labor unions.
Walsh and Connolly are entering next week’s election in a dead heat. In a MassINC Polling Group poll of 503 likely voters last week, 35 percent of the likely voters expressed their support for Connolly, while 34 percent of voters said they intended to vote for Walsh.
In an interview after Monday’s event, Glaeser, who is also director of the Rappaport Institute of Greater Boston, said he was “deeply honored” to speak with Walsh and Connolly.“I think Boston is very blessed to have two very capable, very energetic candidates,” Glaeser said.
In these same remarks, Glaeser also identified three key challenges that the next mayor of Boston is likely to face: making the city affordable to rich, middle-income, and lower-income communities alike; reforming the permitting system to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses in Boston, and improving education in the city.
In interviews after the event, members of the audience said they enjoyed the opportunity to listen to the candidates in advance of the election, saying they thought the discussions were informed and interesting. Several, however, offered suggestions for further improvements to the city.
Steve Hollinger, a Boston resident who has lived in the city for 23 years, expressed concerns about the way the Seaport Innovation District initiative and the city more broadly are being planned.
“About every five years, the city introduces a completely new vision for the district, so there is never one consistent plan,” Hollinger said.
Diane Williams, an entrepreneur who works in Boston, said she was glad that Connolly mentioned public-private partnerships, saying she believes they have the potential to help expand awareness of educational and entrepreneurial opportunities in the city.
“Boston is so incredibly rich with education and startups,” Williams said. “But the Bostonian kids are not being given the information…about the awesome, amazing, remarkable opportunities there are in the Boston area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 29, 2013, at 10:07 p.m.
A petition to make gender-neutral housing options available for all students at the College has reached the requisite 670-signature threshold to appear as a referendum question on next month’s Undergraduate Council presidential ballot, petition organizer Julia R. Geiger ’16 confirmed Tuesday.
 
“I thought there was going to be a lot of support for this from conversations with students around campus, but I was frankly surprised at how quickly the signatures came in,” said petition writer Jordan T. Weiers ’16, mentioning that petition had garnered 720 signatures in a little less than a week.
If the signatures are confirmed by the UC Rules Committee, the petition will go before student voters in the Nov. 18-21 UC presidential election. 
Currently, gender-neutral housing options are not available for freshmen, and upperclassmen living in mixed-gender suites in some Houses must have locks on their bedroom doors. But a gender-neutral housing pilot program launched in 2011 lifted that requirement in six upperclassman Houses. This past spring, Winthrop joined the Houses already participating in the pilot program.
 
Weiers said that the referendum is just one of the ways he and his colleagues are pushing for the permanent expansion of gender-neutral housing on campus.
 
“We’re taking a multi-faceted approach gender-neutral housing in all the Houses,” Weiers said. “The referendum is to show the administration that there is a lot of student support for this.”
 
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14, petition organizer Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, and Weiers will be meeting with Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94 on Friday.
 
“The meeting is going to be about sharing information and discussing next steps with the [gender neutral housing pilot] program,” Raghuveer said.
According to UC Rules Committee Chair Kevin H. Xiong ’17, two other groups are seeking a place on the ballot. The Environmental Action Committee is petitioning for a ban on the sale and distribution of single-use plastic water bottles on campus, and Students for a Just and Sustainable Future is calling on Harvard to purchase an MBTA pass for every student, given that the MBTA provides a 50 percent discount under the UPass system. 
Following a change in procedure from last fall, all potential referendum questions will be checked for neutral wording and a group opposing a petition question may submit a 300-word con-statement, which will appear on the ballot along with a 300-word pro-statement from petition supporters.
If any petition is approved, it will mark the second time in two years that at least one referendum question will make the ballot. Last November, all three referenda on the ballot—petitions to establish a social choice endowment fund, divest University funds from the fossil fuel industry, and reform the College’s sexual assault policies—passed with the support of decisive majorities of undergraduate voters.
If successfully passed in an election in which the majority of the student body votes, referenda become the official position of the UC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 29, 2013, at 8:08 p.m.
Intellectual property lawyer William F. Lee ’72 will become the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation—Harvard’s highest governing body—in the summer of 2014, the University announced in a press release Tuesday afternoon. His promotion comes as current Senior Fellow Robert D. Reischauer ’63 and Corporation member Robert E. Rubin ’60 prepare to leave their posts next summer.
The University has yet to announce who will fill the two resulting vacancies.
“I have long treasured my relationship with Harvard,” said Reischauer, who joined the Corporation in 2002, in the press release. “It has been a particular privilege to work with Harvard’s presidents and my Corporation and Overseer colleagues to strengthen the University during these times of unprecedented challenge, promise, and institutional change.”
Reischauer has worked closely with University President Drew G. Faust to launch internal reforms aimed at increasing the transparency and diversity of the Corporation.
These include the expansion of the board from 7 to 13 members and the initiation of a term limit for members—both changes that were implemented this summer upon completion of a three-year review of the Corporation.
By their official departure date of June 30, 2014, Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and president emeritus of the Urban Institute, and Rubin, co-chair of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former treasury secretary, each will have served on the Corporation for 12 years, in accordance with the new term limit.
Faust, who as University president is also a member of the Corporation, lauded Reischauer dedication and efficacy as senior fellow in a press release.
“His legacy, as the senior fellow who did so much to shape and implement our recent governance reforms, will carry on for decades ahead,” she said. “I’m immensely grateful for his leadership, his insight and counsel, and his unwavering personal support.”
Reischauer currently chairs the Corporation’s governance committee and has previously spearheaded the Corporation's finance and shareholder responsibility committees.
Similarly, Lee, who was elected to the Corporation in 2010, serves on several committees and, like Reischauer, joined the Corporation after serving on the University’s other governing body, the Board of Overseers.
In an interview Tuesday afternoon, Lee said that the role of the senior fellow had become better defined with the implementation of governance reforms, particularly given the group’s expanded size. With 13 people comprising what he called an “extraordinary and interesting group,” Lee said that discussions featured a greater variety of opinions—a good thing, he added.
“An academic institution ought to be a place where there is a diversity of opinions,” said Lee, who added that, as senior fellow, he would encourage the “free exchange” of such ideas.
Lee also said, however, that he did not foresee the Corporation taking a markedly new direction with the changes announced Tuesday.
“I think for an institution like Harvard, it’s important to have a governance structure that ensures that it is robust, but also consistent,” he said. “It’s not something that’s determined by the particular identity of the senior fellow.”
Calling Lee a “worthy” successor to Reischauer, Faust praised Lee’s “blend of imagination and pragmatism” and “his savvy about organizations and about people” in a press release.
“His interests, concerns, and relationships range across the University, and he knows that innovation is one of Harvard’s proudest traditions,” Faust said in the announcement. “All of us on the Corporation consider ourselves fortunate to have, in Bill Lee, so worthy a successor to Bob Reischauer.”
In the press release, Lee said that he looked forward to helping ensure that Harvard remains the “most extraordinary academic institution in the world.”
“I am deeply honored and humbled to have been chosen to serve as senior fellow,” he said. “Bob Reischauer has been a wonderful leader, pioneering fundamental changes in our governance. I can only hope that we will build upon all he has accomplished.”

Like many of her colleagues across the College, Jennifer J. Malin ’09 was very invested in the intellectual growth of her students when she served as a teaching fellow for undergraduates. But she also went above the call of duty, taking special note of the physical comfort of those under her charge. When she taught Visual and Environmental Studies 50: “Introduction to Nonfiction Filmmaking,” Malin shared a technique of standing while using heavy cameras to help students avoid pulling their muscles.
According to professors and students, this was the type of warmth and care that characterized Malin, who passed away from injuries sustained during a car crash Saturday night in West Austin, Texas.
“She just thought of things other people didn't, and always challenged and encouraged you at the same time,” wrote Rebecca C. Maddalo ’13 in an email to The Crimson. Maddalo, who was a student of Malin’s in several classes, said she was very dedicated to her teaching.
“Jenny was one of the sweetest, brightest TFs I've ever had,” Maddalo said. “She was engaging and involved in her students' work, often staying late to help give Final Cut workshops or give feedback on the latest cut of your film.”
Malin became a TF at Harvard after her graduation from the College, but she was known for her keen eye as a filmmaker even as a student. A joint concentrator in VES and Folklore and Mythology, she produced videos about topics ranging from followers of the Hare Krishna movement in Boston to African Diaspora Dance. She was actively involved in many art forms around campus as an actress, sound designer, and photographer, and her thesis—a film about mega-churches in Texas—won both the Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize and the Swapna Dev Memorial Book Prize in Folklore and Mythology.
“The film was remarkable in the clarity and acceptance of the world she was filming,” wrote.
Malin’s thesis advisor, VES professor of practice Ross McElwee, in an email to The Crimson. “It was a world which was not really hers, but one which she explored with sensitivity, curiosity, humor, and respect.”
“We’ll miss her tremendously,” McElwee added. “Her radiant smile and cheerful greeting come back to me now.”
Deborah D. Foster, a senior lecturer in folklore and mythology who worked closely with Malin, said that the same approachability that made Malin a good teacher helped her create her own thoughtful work.
“She found a way of making these huge institutions close and personal,” said Foster. “She made people have empathy for mega-churches no matter what your views on them were. People trusted her and opened up to her—they told her their stories.”
Malin interned at a number of mental health hotlines after graduating from Harvard. She hoped to pursue a career in psychology.
“The entire department is devastated by her passing away,” said Foster. “She was warm, kind, and had a spirit of openness and non-judgment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú has donated $74 million to the Broad Institute to continue studying the genomic basis of human disease—the second gift he has given for this effort—according to an announcement made by Slim and Broad President and Director Eric S. Lander at the Broad Institute on Monday.
The donation will build upon the success of research initiated by his first grant, $65 million donated in 2010 for phase one of the Slim Initiative for Genomic Medicine in the Americas—a partnership between the Broad Institute, the Carlos Slim Health Institute, and the National Institute of Genomic Medicine of Mexico.
SIGMA has focused on Latin American populations, which have traditionally been under-researched in genetic studies relative to samples from people of European descent.
“Most genomic research has focused on European or European-derived populations,” said Lander during the announcement on Monday. “It is like doing science with one eye closed.”
Phase one efforts by SIGMA researchers have led to a number of findings, including the identification of new genetic drivers for breast cancer and lymphoma as well as the discovery of a genetic variant that predisposes Latin Americans to type II diabetes.
Phase two of the program will address high-burden diseases, including cancer, kidney disease, and type II diabetes. The project will also emphasize discoveries that can be translated to a clinical setting.
“In truth, this is the next logical extension of the human genome project,” said Joan E. Bailey-Wilson, a branch chief at the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health. “This research will be provide more tools for our toolbox by giving us decent sequencing coverage over populations that have simply not been studied thoroughly.”
The Broad Institute, a joint venture of Harvard and MIT, brings together faculty and students from both universities as well as biomedical researchers from hundreds of private and public institutions around the globe.
“The Broad Institute is a world leader in genomic medicine and shares our own vision for overcoming some of the greatest challenges and solutions in public health,” said Slim at the announcement. “I am convinced that the discoveries we make together will strongly impact the population in Mexico and worldwide.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-eight yards and one second were all freshman forward Midge Purce needed to send Princeton into a tailspin Saturday night at Soldier’s Field.
The jaw-dropping shot was one of two scored by Purce as she helped the Crimson women’s soccer team gain revenge on the Tigers for last year’s 3-1 loss.
With Purce’s fiery offensive performance, Harvard not only avenged the loss, but also put up its best showing against the team since 2010, with four goals and a defensive shutout.
“It was my first game against them,” Purce said. “They were a really fun team to play, they brought a lot of energy and really had great possession... It was just a really exciting day.”
And an exciting day it was for Purce, who shined in the contest.  Purce notched her second multi-goal performance of the season, proceeding to take over the position as scoring leader in the Ivy league conference with a total of 10 goals scored.
The freshman is no stranger to powerful offensive play. In addition to leading the Ivy League in goals scored, Purce also leads the entire conference in points, with 23, and shots taken, with 66 attempts on goals.
The last player to lead in all three of these categories for the entire league was Katherine Sheeleigh ’11 in the 2010 season. The achievement accurately reflects a consistently successful season for the rookie.
“She’s done well the whole season,” Head Coach Ray Leone said.  “But this was a particularly special game. She had high energy the whole time and played very well.”
The highlight of the game was without a doubt the midfield shot that Purce fired into Tiger territory with just one tick left on the clock before halftime.  The shot sailed 48 yards and just out of the goalie’s reach, stunning the Princeton defense and wrapping up the first frame with a bang.
In a game against such an intense rival, the goal was exactly what Harvard needed to take command of the game once and for all.
“She had a few chances, and she just really got a hold of that one,” Leone said. “At night, a well struck ball like that is hard to handle”
Purce’s second goal came at the end of the second half, as she stole the ball and proceeded to evade three Princeton defenders while driving to the goal. This athletic display ended in the fourth and final goal for Harvard, which comfortably secured the 4-0 victory.
The win over Princeton has propelled Purce and the rest of the Crimson squad into the first-place spot in the Ivy League for the first time since 2011 with 15 points. The next closest competitor is Penn, with 10 points. The squad is undefeated in Ivy League play, an achievement which is in part owed to Purce’s noteworthy offensive performance thus far.
“First of all, she’s got an amazing drive,” Leone said. “She has a determination that is at the highest level, every time she steps on the field whether it be for practice or games... She’s a very athletic player; she’s very explosive and exciting on the ball.”
In spite of her impressive individual showing this year, Purce is quick to give her entire team credit for the offensive success she has been consistently posting on the field.
“It’s the way the team has been playing together,” Purce said.  “We are learning what type of players we are, and how to play with each other. It’s really connecting, and it’s making good things happen on the field... We play for each other as a team, and that’s the reason why we’ve been successful thus far.”
It is this strong sense of team that drives Purce to perform at her best each time she steps onto the field.
“This [season] is the last time we’ll ever have the exact same team,” Purce said. “So we want to make it special for the girls who are leaving, and whoever’s last few games these are.”
With only two more conference games left in the season, maintaining this high level of play will be instrumental in finishing the season on a strong note, as the squad attempts to clinch the ultimate goal of an Ivy League title.
“We want to win,” Purce said. “We want to play the best game that we can play.”
Purce will look to cotinue making defenses sweat as the Crimson takes to the road for a matchup with Brown on Tuesday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team continues its quest for redemption as it looks to defeat No. 10 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in what could be the Engineers’ first loss at home this season.
The Crimson (1-0-0, 0-0-0 ECAC) will travel to Houston Field House on Tuesday evening to face RPI (4-1-0, 0-0-0 ECAC), commencing conference play for both teams. Harvard will confront the Engineers again on Friday, completing the home-and-home series at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Last season, the Crimson matched up against the Engineers twice. Harvard raked in the win in its first meeting of the 2012-’13 season, besting RPI 4-0. However, in its second contest, the Engineers found the back of the net three times while a strong defense held the Crimson scoreless.
In its opening game against Bentley on Saturday, the Crimson kept the Falcons off the board for the entirety of the game. But Harvard’s defense struggled with some key aspects of play.
“We need to block some more shots,” sophomore Kyle Criscuolo said. “[Bentley] got 43 shots against our team.”
Veteran goaltender Raphael Girard was crucial to the Crimson’s success against Bentley.
“Girard has an unbelievable game. He can make some really hard saves look easy,” junior Tommy O’Regan said.
Harvard will look to Girard again in the upcoming two games against RPI to lead the team defensively against some strong Engineer attackers. Ryan Haggerty, the nation’s leading scorer so far this season, comes into the game with eight goals to his name; but, the Crimson held Haggerty goalless in its last meeting.
“We had some trouble getting the puck out sometimes,” O’Regan said. “And RPI will definitely take advantage of those opportunities if we are slow to transition.”
Harvard was also unable to capitalize on man-up opportunities against the Falcons. Despite this struggle on special teams the team is not concerned about its ability to score on power plays.
“We’ll practice and go over some specifics,” O’Regan said. “We will end up scoring on the power play…. It’s early in the season and everyone is still figuring everything out.”
The Crimson will depend on a number of newcomers to help the team capture the victory against the Engineers. Rookies Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone—the team’s only two NHL draft picks in the recruiting class of 2017—each tallied an assist against Bentley.
“We have a lot of young guys, who are looking pretty comfortable especially for their first college games,” O’Regan said. “They are definitely going to help the team a lot.”
Kerfoot and Malone skate alongside classmate forwards Luke Esposito, Tyler Moy, Devin Tringale, and Phil Zielonka, and their three defensive counterparts, Clay Anderson, Victor Newell, and Kevin Guiltinan.
Some returning forwards have already shined for Harvard early in the season, including Criscuolo, who added two to the scoreboard against Bentley.
O’Regan also tallied a point against Bentley. But finding the back of the net may be harder against a physical Engineers defense.
“RPI has some big defenseman so we’re going to have to work on getting it behind them coming in the zone and then pressuring hard,” O’Regan said.
RPI’s strong defense has held opponents to an average of 1.30 goals per game in the Engineer’s three-game winning streak. In last year’s loss against Rensselaer, the Engineer’s back line held the Crimson to just 11 shots on the night.
“We got a slow start [against Bentley],” Criscuolo said. “The first period we have to keep it simple against RPI. They’re a big team so we know we’re going to have to get guys behind their defensemen and use our own speed…. This year they have already proven themselves. They have played quite a few good teams and have been successful.”
No. 13/14 Boston University has been one of RPI’s big name opponents in the season thus far. The Engineers topped the Terriers earlier this month, 3-1, with two goals from Ryan Haggerty. Their only loss came against then No. 5 Boston College, a 7-2 defeat suffered last Wednesday.
“We played pretty well as a team for the first game,” O’Regan said. “We are coming into the game with the confidence that we can definitely hold our own against a big RPI lineup.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the wind that proved dominant this weekend, as the Harvard Sailing team struggled against surprisingly strong gusts on both Saturday and Sunday in four regional regattas. Despite some impressive individual finishes, the team overall faltered in the heavy wind, placing in the bottom half of all four competitions.
75TH ANNUAL OBERG TROPHY
In its strongest performance of the weekend, the Crimson took 11th on its home course on the Charles. Harvard crews were forced to deal with both unusually heavy winds for the basin and an unfamiliar type of boat.
“This weekend was a pretty odd weekend for the Charles,” freshman skipper Matt Mollerus said. “Usually we don’t get that much wind, but this weekend we saw probably an average of the upper teens on Saturday, and then Sunday was also very windy and puffy. Sailing on the Charles we’re used to very light and consistent conditions, so that’s something we had to adjust to.”
Mollerus and his crew, junior Sydney Karnovsky, were one of the bright spots for the team at the regatta. The two earned four victories in the B division on their way to a second place finish, just behind Boston University.
“At this regatta, we sailed a boat that we don’t usually sail, the Firefly,” Mollerus said. “But I feel like Sydney and I have sort of figured that out better than really any other team, so we were pretty dominant.”
Sophomore Marek Zaleski and freshman Emma Wheeler also performed well, earning two wins in the A division on their way to an 11th place finish, while junior Reid Bergsund and freshman Olivia Kjorlien earned two runner-up finishes on their way to placing 14th in the C division.
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
The Crimson had a tougher time competing on Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, as the team finished 14th out of 17 teams for its worst finish overall.
Racing in 420s, Michael Drumm, Isabel Ruane, and Luke O’Connor struggled after their early success, finishing 16th in the A Division.
In the B Division, Ruane joined forces with junior Gram Slattery, sophomore Jacob Bradt, and freshman Julia Lord, all of whom contributed throughout the regatta.
CENTRAL SERIES 6
Sixteen teams from 13 schools came together for the Central Series 6 hosted by Boston College. After consistent racing from both boats over the two days, Harvard finished in 12th while two teams from Tufts claimed both first and second place overall.
The Crimson once again struggled with windier than usual conditions, as the sailors were forced to focus on just keeping the boat upright as opposed to more tactical matters.
“A lot of dealing with the wind is really just focusing,” freshman crew Bennett Capozzi said. “When it’s really windy your boat can be overpowered, which means it’s a lot of work to really keep your boat going fast and going forward and even not flipping, to an extent.”
Sophomores Dan Leichus and Adam Brodheim earned two top-ten finishes in the B division to place 10th. Capozzi handled crew responsibilities for all eight races junior while Ansel Duff and freshman William Bloxham rotated in and out as skipper as the Crimson’s A-division boat placed 13th.
STU NELSON TROPHY
As the coeds competed across Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the women headed to Connecticut to compete in the Stu Nelson Trophy hosted by Connecticut College. Yale and Brown went back and forth all weekend, with Yale ultimately taking first.
Harvard was bolstered by the strong performance of junior crew Ashleigh English and sophomore skipper Sophie Bermudez. The two teamed up to take seventh in the B division on a victory and two runner-up finishes.
The Crimson’s performance varied throughout the regatta. In the A division, Harvard could not establish a rhythm, as senior Caitlin Watson and sophomore Kristina Jakobson placed all over the board as they struggled to a 16th-place finish. The Crimson finished the regatta 12th out of 18 teams, and, moving forward, will look to learn from its experiences with the challenging wind.
“We knew going into the weekend that heavy wind sailing was one of our weaknesses that we really need to work on,” Drumm said. “Our main focus now is our big qualifier this weekend at MIT for the Atlantic Coast Championships, so we’re focusing more on that at practice this week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Women’s Golf wrapped up its third tournament victory of the season at the Lehigh Invitational over the past two days, providing a successful conclusion to an excellent fall season.
The team romped home by twelve strokes in the end over Ivy rival Princeton following an initially close first day.
“It was windy and kind of cold so a lot of the teams were distracted and weren’t able to score as well as they normally would,” Coach Kevin Rhoads said. “However, we were able to score pretty close to what we normally do and came away with the good result.”
It was a high-quality performance from the Crimson squad, as all four of the players whose scores counted towards the team total had high individual finishes.
Bonnie Hu, Anne Cheng and Courtney Hooton all finished tied for fourth place, while junior Tiffany Lim claimed second place with very consistent rounds of 74 and 72, both under tough conditions.
“She hit a lot of good shots and then when she was fooled by the wind or it was hard for her to know what to do, she hunkered down and made some good putts,” Rhoads said. “She also managed herself and the golf course really well so I’m really pleased for her.”
Throughout the tournament, observers and players alike could not help but comment on the tough playing conditions, which served as a timely reminder that the mild autumn days will now inevitably begin to fade into the frigid grips of winter in the northeast.
Coach Rhoads was keen to stress that the course itself was not to blame, but rather the late-October weather, which incurred a frost delay on both days.
While the rough weather surely impacted almost all aspects of play over the course of the weekend, senior captain Hu thought that the greens were made particularly tough by the elements.
“The course conditions were very hard because it was really windy and the greens were incredibly fast,” Hu said. “But I would say everyone on the team concentrated on their own game and played their best. Ultimately we were rewarded.”
The conditions were harsher on Sunday and proved particularly tough for Navy. The Midshipmen’s total score improved from 380 on Sunday, when two of its players shot triple digits, to 346 on Monday.
Throughout the tournament, only one round was under par, courtesy of reigning Ivy League champion and eventual winner Kelly Shon of Princeton.
This marks the end of a successful fall season for the Crimson. The team has positioned itself as the premier Ivy squad, twice ousting old foes in the Tigers, including on their own course.
Not only has Harvard won all three tournaments played on the East Coast, but it has also managed a more than respectable finish of sixth against extremely high-level of competition at the Golfweek Conference Challenge.
The weather now gets cooler and the golfers will move inside before emerging to battle again in the spring.
As a whole, the team emphasizes the process of improving and competing over specific outcomes, yet to this point in the season, its outcomes have failed to disappoint.
“It is fun at artificial breaks, like the end of the season for example, to ask ‘How did we do?’, and ‘Are we working on the right things?’,” Rhoads said. “If we measure ourselves against the competition we had, we had three wins and… it was a pretty successful fall. I am very proud of what the team did. I am very proud of how we worked as a team. Nobody takes days off, nobody is selfish.”
“To have good team results all the time in such an individual sport, everyone really has to do the right things day in day out,” he continued. “The fact that we do that and have some nice results to show for it—I think that’s quite a successful fall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Princeton Three-Mile Chase on Sunday, Harvard Men’s Lightweight Crew gained an important win after falling to Princeton in the lightweight varsity eight race at the Head of the Charles Regatta the previous weekend.
For the third year in a row, the varsity lightweight four won its race. This year the first varsity four boat was manned by coxswain Shane Bouchard, junior Andrew Campbell, sophomore Samuel Frum, freshman Jack Kelly, and stroke Alexander Bonorris.  The boat finished the race in 14:40.194, a full nine seconds ahead of the runner up, Yale.
The win brings reassurance to a team in transition. The Crimson has brought on a new coach and a core of young players to the team.  Coach Michiel Bartman had previously coached the Radcliffe women’s lightweight team before being called upon by the Harvard lightweights to fill their coaching void.
“That was a good event for the team today,” captain Alexander Bonorris said. “I think that breaking down into fours is helpful because we were pleased with that result for sure. We were racing against both Yale and Princeton who have very good lightweight crews so we are pleased to have beaten them.”
Harvard’s second varsity four boat finished 15th with a time of 15:57.656. The Crimson’s third and fourth varsity four boats placed 19th and 20th respectively, finishing less than a second apart. Their respective times were 16:04.338 and 16:04.955.
“I think where we’re at right now sets us up for a really good winter training session that will in turn set us up for success in the spring,” Bonorrois said. “We’re hungry for more competition in the days, weeks, and months to come.”
The lightweight men’s eights did not encounter the same success as the lightweight fours, with none of the three boats entered in the race finishing in the top ten for the first time in three years. The fastest boat for Harvard was the second varsity eight boat, which finished the race in 14:06.074.
The race for the second varsity eights started out on a straight course with minimal wind, which allowed the boat to push forward, but as it turned the corner and entered the second part of the race the winds picked up, forcing the team to rely on technical rowing to get them to the finish.
“Everybody pulled hard at the beginning and then pushed through the finish,” junior Robert Hawthorne said. “In long races it is really important to make sure you keep your head about you the entire time. It’s a rewarding race because you finish at the boathouse where you have everybody cheering for you.”
The first varsity eight boat, which is rowing with only two returning members after six of last year’s eight graduated, suffered a penalty during the race that added a minute to its finishing time. Originally the team finished the race in 13:48.196, but because of the penalty the crew ended up in 21st place with an official time of 14:48.196.
“The most important thing is to get guys into boats to get them experience so we have the best spring season that we can have,” Hawthorne said.
The third varsity eights boat finished ahead of the first boat, placing 19th with a time of 14:33.229.
“There are always expectations going into a race…and we had some results that we weren’t necessarily satisfied with, but we want to emphasize that this is the fall season,” Bonorris said. “We’re in a constant build coming out of the fall… we have good momentum.”
The two lightweight freshman boats that were entered in the race placed ninth and 28th among their competition. The first freshman boat finished with a time of 14:25.460, while the second freshman boat finished in 17:16.231.
But for a young team, this weekend’s showing is just another step toward becoming a competitive force in the spring.
“We have to start storing up excitement for the entire program,” Bonorris said. “It’s about the team rising up and improving all together, which is something that takes a lot of work, patience, and persistence, which is something that we have and something we’re looking forward to as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Midge Purce's two goals were enough to earn the women's soccer freshman our Athlete of the Week honors, she wasn't the only one to have a stand-out weekend for Harvard.
Raphael Girard, Men’s Ice Hockey
 
Senior goaltender Raphael Girard of the Men’s Ice Hockey team was simply dominant against Bentley this past weekend, shutting out the Falcons’ offense en route to a 3-0 victory for the Crimson in its season opener. Saturday’s game marked Girard’s third shutout as a Harvard goalie—interestingly enough, his first shutout, which came last fall, was also against Bentley.
 
Emerance Maschmeyer, Women’s Ice Hockey
 
It seems as if the men’s and women’s ice hockey teams were both on a defensive roll this past weekend, as sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer of the women’s ice hockey team also posted a career-highlight game, playing a crucial role in the Crimson’s 4-0 shutout of Princeton. Thanks to Maschmeyer’s dominance in front of the net, Harvard has improved to a perfect 2-0-0 for the season. Maschmeyer notched 44 saves, a huge career high, and silenced the Tigers’ offense throughout the game.
 
Ricky Zorn, Football
 
While the 51-48 triple-overtime loss to Princeton last Saturday was a tough one for the Crimson to take, senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn put his offensive talent on display once again. Zorn caught eight passes for a career-high 168 yards and a touchdown, including an impressive 33-yard completion in the second quarter off of a Princeton attempt to deflect quarterback Connor Hempel’s pass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took nearly 100 minutes for someone to score Tuesday night in Providence, but with a second overtime looming in the rafters, senior co-captain Elizabeth Weisman delivered for the Harvard women’s soccer team.
For the Crimson (10-3-2, 5-0 Ivy), it was the second time in two weeks facing Brown (8-5-1, 3-1-1). Unlike the 3-1 victory on October 19, yesterday’s matchup did not count toward the conference standings.
This time around, the teams were able to hold each other off until Weisman capitalized, giving Harvard the 1-0 victory in overtime.
“It’s always tough playing a team two times in a row,” senior co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “We had to get creative and try new things and in the end it came down to being incredibly competitive and determined to win a game.”
That determination paid off in overtime with Weisman’s header.
The ball started wide on the right side with junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby who then crossed and passed it over the back line to the far post on the left where Weisman was waiting.
Despite being six inches shorter than her defender, Weisman was able to head the ball into the net, sealing the victory for the Crimson.
“I’m very happy I was able to contribute to the team’s win after a hard fought game,” Weisman said. “My main goal now is to stay in the moment.”
The first half of the game was dry for Harvard’s offense, with only four shots on goal by the Crimson. After the half the offense was able to pick up the pace pressuring the Bears and recording five more opportunities.
“There were some opportunities we missed that we will have to go back and look at on tape,” coach Ray Leone said. “That is something we will work on this week in order to get better for the next game.”
On the defensive side of the ball, Harvard allowed no member of Brown’s offense to take multiple shots. The Bears were unable to get anything going all night recording only four shots.
“They did a great job blocking shots and the goal keeper was excellent,” Leone said. “They were very disciplined… Brown had a lot of opportunities and we just absorbed them as much as we could. It was a very physical game and I’m proud of the team’s resilience.”
The Crimson split time in net between freshman Lizzie Durack, who was awarded the win, and junior Cheta Emba.
Durack played during the overtime period and saved all three shots that got through to her, while Emba was in goal for the entire first half and was able to stop the lone shot she faced from getting past her.
For Brown, senior MC Barrett let Weisman’s header go by to seal the victory for Harvard.
Senior Amber Bledsoe also played in net for the Bears and was able to stop all five shots on goal she received. Although Weisman scored the lone goal of the match, other members of the Crimson presented offensive threats throughout the game.
Freshmen forwards Margaret Purce, Joan Fleischman, and Karly Zlatic all had two shots on goal, while Cassells-Hamby and junior defender Marie Margolius each added one a piece.
“Brown came prepared today and changed their play to fit our passing lines,” Weisman said. “Over the course of the game we figured out how to play around them and how to get shots on the goal.”
For Harvard, this is the team’s fourth win in a row, and it has not lost a game since September 11. In its last 10 games, the Crimson has scored one goal or less only twice.
During that span, Harvard has held its opponent scoreless five times. Harvard stands atop the Ivy League standings, a full five points ahead of second place Penn.
“I can’t talk enough about the maturity of this team and their ability to take each practice one at a time and with that each game one at time,” Johnson said. “We try to have the mentality that the next game is always the most important team so we will just take it one step at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team climbed out of an early hole to tie No. 10 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 3-3, in Troy, N.Y., Tuesday night.
After 15 minutes of play at the Houston Field House, things looked dire for the Crimson (1-0-1, 0-0-1 ECAC). Sophomore Steve Michalek yielded three goals on the Engineers’ (4-1-1, 0-0-1 ECAC) first four shots as RPI’s skilled forwards blew by Harvard defensemen with ease.
Harvard appeared well on its way to repeating its last result in Troy—a  3-0 shutout loss in the midst of its longest losing streak of the 2012-13 season. But in the final two frames of regulation, a different Crimson squad found another gear.
“I thought it was a real character-building game for us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We really stayed with the game plan.”
Goals from freshman Alexander Kerfoot and sophomores Greg Gozzo and Brian Hart allowed Harvard to earn a point in the ECAC standings.
Kerfoot’s first career NCAA goal put Harvard on the comeback trail early in the second period. The freshman center tapped in a rebound in the slot from sophomore linemate Jimmy Vesey after the Crimson put on an extra skater for a pending RPI penalty.
The Crimson carried the momentum generated by Kerfoot’s strike through the last two periods of regulation.
Harvard dominated the third period, outshooting RPI, 15-8. Freshman center Sean Malone threaded a slick tape-to-tape pass to Gozzo in the slot to bring the Crimson within one.
“I think the guys could taste then that the game was well within reach,” Donato said.
Sophomore forward Brian Hart knocked in the tying goal with less than ten minutes left in regulation. Freshman Kevin Guiltinan unleashed a shot at the point that deflected off two RPI sticks before Hart corralled it for the score.
“We had a good cycle set up,” said Guiltinan, who recorded his first two NCAA points on Tuesday. “We had lots of pressure on them at that point.”
Harvard had several opportunities to grab the decisive goal in regulation. Sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo forced RPI goaltender Scott Diebold to make a glove save minutes after Hart’s tying marker.
RPI rediscovered some of their edge in the extra frame, but four blocked shots by Crimson skaters kept the Engineers at bay.
“I think [RPI] responded well,” Donato said. “I don’t think they got any great looks in overtime, but we would like to have some more chances ourselves.”
Harvard pressured the Engineers well in the opening shifts, but RPI forward Johnny Rogic led an offensive flurry for the hosts four and a half minutes into the first. Junior Crimson defenseman Mark Luzar was unable to track the senior Engineer, who swept the puck from the blueline to the crease almost uncontested.
Less than three minutes later, junior forward Ryan Haggerty delivered the Engineers’ second goal on the power play. The nation’s leading scorer blasted a one-timer from the top of the left faceoff circle for his ninth goal of the year.
Brock Higgs added RPI’s third off a long lead pass from junior linemate Zach Schroeder. Higgs skated around Michalek’s poke-check to slide the puck through an unguarded crease.
Harvard nevertheless managed to reset after the first intermission. The initial miscues did not seem to faze the Crimson.
“We knew we had the team in here to get the job done,” Guiltinan said.
After an inauspicious start in his first game in over a year, Michalek settled in net to turn away RPI’s last 21 shots, a few from point-blank range.
“I think [Michalek] really responded from a tough start, dug in and played very good,” Donato said. “For the second and third periods, and as a group, we really learned a lot about ourselves tonight, so that was a positive.”
As Donato continues to assess his team’s goaltending, Harvard will likely turn to senior Raphael Girard when the Crimson hosts RPI at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Friday night. The young squad is also still getting a feel for its offensive capabilities.
“We’ll continue to make adjustments and continue to learn as any team does early in the season, but especially with the amount of underclassmen we have,” Donato said. “I think there’s a lot to be improved on, but I like the effort and the comeback was certainly a real team-builder.”
On Friday, the home team will look to limit the bad bounces and errors of Tuesday night’s first 20 minutes. The last 45 give Guiltinan confidence.
“I think we have more in the tank,” Guiltinan said.

Editor’s Note: While we at Flyby love giving you advice, we’ll be the first to admit that we don’t always quite know what we’re talking about when we do. But rest assured, dear readers—here is some advice worth taking notes on. In the hope of helping you to land that dream internship and/or job, we’re proud to present the advice of a real live Silicon Valley Professional, Jeremy L. Lizt ’97. Take it away, Jeremy.
As a Harvard undergrad applying for jobs, I had a substantially different idea of what made for a successful interview than I have now. My primary objective then was to perform the same way I was used to performing on every other test I had taken until that point in my life, namely, get the right answer to every question and demonstrate knowledge and intelligence.
Things look a lot different from the other side of the table. Having hired and managed dozens of software engineers (and having interviewed more than 800) over the past seven years, I have an evolved perspective on what to look for in a candidate. I share a few tips here in hopes they will help you become a better interviewee than I was.
Put Yourself in Her ShoesYou will be a far more effective interviewee the better you can sympathize with the motivations of the person on the other side of the phone or desk. What kinds of challenges does she face? What does she look for in a candidate? You may not be able to answer these in advance of the interview; that’s okay, they are perfectly good questions for you to ask directly.
Perhaps the most fundamental thing I didn’t recognize as an undergrad but that is shockingly obvious to me now is this: as a hiring manager, my primary motivation is not specifically hiring the most talented individuals, but building the most effective team. With that in mind, I think about three key dimensions when evaluating a candidate: capability, communication, and attitude. The last two are far more important to me than I ever would have guessed years ago.
Communicate, Don’t DazzleGood communication skills are critical to any team enterprise. An engineer may be sufficiently bright, knowledgeable, and individually capable, but if she is unable to communicate her thoughts, feelings, and ideas in clear and concise language, there will be commensurate cost to the effectiveness of the team.
Communication is about effectively transmitting information and enabling others to understand something new. When a candidate regales me with esoteric jargon, I feel that only two things have been communicated: she knows what she’s talking about, and she’s not a particularly good communicator.
Give 'Em AttitudeI value a positive attitude far, far more than I ever would have imagined when I was an undergrad. Remember, I am hiring to build an effective team. An individual’s attitude can have an outsized effect (in either direction) on the entire team.
“Attitude” can mean a lot of things, so let me suggest a few concrete behaviors you can exhibit in an interview to demonstrate a positive attitude. The first I hope is obvious: show humility, not arrogance, and don’t be afraid to admit when you don’t know something.
Second, work hard. Some candidates give me the distinct sense that they will continue to think about a problem long after the interview is over; this is often more instructive to me than someone’s quickly getting to a correct answer.
Third—and I hope this is obvious as well—do your homework! Read through the company’s website at a minimum; look up your interviewer on LinkedIn (you expect her to review your resumé, right?); and prepare a handful of intelligent questions.
Don’t Worry Too MuchThere’s only so much you can do to prepare for an interview. You’re not going to meaningfully improve your technical capabilities or core communication skills in a short period of time.
Try not to beat yourself up over an interview performance, especially because your feelings about how it went may be wildly off-base. Some candidates think they did badly because they didn’t get a particular answer, while some think they did well because they weren’t challenged. In fact, both may be wrong. When I find a promising candidate, I’d like to see how they work through a problem they might not solve; when a candidate is clearly not a fit, it’s not worth doing the exercise.
The job interview is an awfully imperfect process, riddled with both false positives (candidates who get jobs in which they won’t succeed) and even more false negatives.
A job is a relationship, a pretty serious relationship that often lasts years. Know that the real goal of an interview is not simply “getting a job,” but evaluating whether it’s a relationship worthy of investment.

October marks the beginning of flu season, which usually reaches its peak in January and February. Given that it would be ideal to avoid the kind of public health emergency that rocked the Boston area last winter, we put together a list of where you can get your flu shot before winter hits.
Harvard University Health Services holds flu vaccination clinics weekly from 12-3 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays. This service is provided at no cost to anyone with a Harvard ID, a HUGHP insurance card, or a HUSHP Blue Cross Blue Shield card and takes place on the second floor of HUHS Holyoke Center in the Monks Library.
 
CVS offers flu vaccines during normal business hours to patrons. Insurance is accepted and recipients of Medicare Part B are also eligible for this service. You can either walk in or make an appointment. Check here for more locations and FAQs.
 
Rite Aid also provides flu shots to customers and rewards them with wellness points. Flu shots are covered by most insurance plans and, if not, are competitively priced.
Stay healthy!

As we all know, last week was Sex Week at Harvard. However, we here at Flyby think that Sex Week missed a few things. In order to enjoy the benefits ot Sex Week to their full potential, we want to take a few minutes to keep in mind what turns us Harvard students on—just in case. 
Telling people we go to HarvardThere’s nothing better than that moment when you’re introduced to someone and they ask where you go to college. If you ever want to feel turned on, I suggest that you walk up to a random person, start a conversation with them, and wait for them to drop the question.
Wearing our Harvard Class t-shirtEveryone in Harvard Square wears Harvard apparel—your typical Harvard sweatshirt or hat. But, only we Harvard students own our Harvard class tee. Nothing feels better than walking through the square—or anywhere in the world for that matter—flaunting our “Class of ____” shirts and proving that we do in fact attend Harvard. We aren’t just wannabes.
Sleepovers at LamontNothing turns us on more than those all-nighters at Lamont. That late night essay in one of those ever-so-comfortable wooden chairs at Lamont is indescribable. Once a Lamonster, always a Lamonster.
Turning in those p-setsWalking up to that TF box, a finished p-set in hand (after an incredible all-nighter at Lamont) is fantastic. Who needs some artificial, overpriced sex toy when you can feel the same pleasure throwing that loose-leaf problem set into the box?
This number varies from school to school and from year to year—sometimes hundreds will be admitted, but sometimes none will. Harvard's dean of admissions, William Fitzsimmons, told The Crimson earlier this year that in recent years, Harvard has accepted between zero and 228 waitlisted students.
The number of students taken off a waitlist is connected to a school's yield, which is the number of admitted students who decide to matriculate. Schools know that not 100 percent of students they admit will say yes, and they plan for this. Still, if fewer students matriculate than expected, they start taking students off the waitlist.
