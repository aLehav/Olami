After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At what point did filmmakers decide that Nazis without supernatural powers were not evil enough? The first Indiana Jones film, an early exemplar of this presumption, featured Steven Spielberg’s Nazis on a manic quest to capture the Ark of the Covenant. Similarly, “Captain America: The First Avenger” enhances its insufficiently nefarious Nazis by granting them some nondescript power “of the gods” with which to commit their sinister acts. This sort of basic thematic coding—Nazis, bad; Nazis plus supernatural force, very bad—runs rampant in the formulaic “Captain America,” a film that substitutes clichés and poor gestures at genuine plotting for real filmmaking.
It is no doubt difficult to make a truly interesting film out of a dated propaganda premise, but the shortcomings of “Captain America” would not be so galling if the film didn’t, in its finer moments, provide sublime glimpses of something greater. At its best, “Captain America” captures a pristine sense of nostalgia, offering elegant shots of a bygone New York and peppering them with snappy dialogue reminiscent of older movies. The grace of these occasional moments is buoyed by the occasional humorous aside that lets the audience know that the film isn’t taking itself too seriously. When Captain America (Chris Evans) tests out his newfound powers in pursuit of a foreign spy, he finds himself in the sort of moral quandary that would have sunk Batman or Spiderman: the villain has taken a little boy and thrown him off a pier into the water. When Captain America sprints to the side of the pier to leap to the boy’s rescue, the child gleefully calls up “Don’t worry—I can swim!” This sort of lightheartedness suits the first avenger’s story best.
The film, however, forsakes its whimsical levity with unannounced sea changes in tone. Pleasant characters who have only just been introduced soon die tragic deaths that beg for collective mourning; a ragged crew of recently emancipated POWs raises up a painfully earnest cry of “Let’s hear it for Captain America!” These nearly schizophrenic shifts in register are destabilizing, pulling the light net of irony and fun from beneath the audience’s feet and submerging them in absurd, clumsy melodrama. This failing is most apparent in the brewing romance between Captain America and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), which turns from playful banter to soul-crushing love in order to provide an emotional undercurrent to the seemingly avoidable sacrifice that concludes the film.
The film’s unbalanced tone is mirrored in its aesthetic confusion. On the one hand, it features drab, soft-focus shots of old-fashioned set pieces. Filled with bomber jackets, classic army helmets, and art deco furnishings, these nostalgic scenes unabashedly revel in the past. Yet Johnston throws the odd futuristic element into the mix, dressing the enemy forces like the stormtroopers of “Star Wars” and implanting a variety of implausibly futuristic sinister technologies.
Were the filmmakers more decisive about what type of film they were making, “Captain America” would undoubtedly have been more successful. All the ingredients were present for campy throwback, full-throated action, or melodramatic nostalgia, yet none of these possibilities is carried through.
Instead, the film’s jarring shifts are aggravated by its singularly bizarre pacing. There is roughly an hour of plodding set-up in which—save for a few humorous moments—there is no character development. Pre-serum, the most defining trait of Steve Rogers, the future Captain America, is that he is small but has a big heart—a mantra that is hammered into the viewer’s skull repeatedly by nearly every character encountered. The title of the film might as well have been “Captain America: The Small Avenger Who Has a Big Heart and, Eventually, Equally Large Muscles.” After this unnecessarily long prelude, the film launches several action sequences, the most important of which happen in long-form montage. Had the filmmakers given Captain America more screen time with which to bash people with his shield, the film might have been more immediate and fulfilling. Alas, the film’s action happens in awkward, disconnected bursts and its emotion is left languishing in poorly developed scenes.
The artistic attraction of producing a Captain America film in the current socio-political climate lies in the incongruity between his America and our own—that is, the contrast between the economically stagnant, politically deadlocked United States of today and the decisive country of yesteryear where cheering on a flamboyantly dressed superhero named “Captain America” would not seem so ridiculous due to the existence of clearly defined external enemies. As if to underscore this irony, “Captain America” came prancing onto screens across the country at a time when the nation was mired in an unnecessarily traumatic fiscal crisis. Watching the film, one gets the feeling that if Captain America were in on the budget talks, Speaker John Boehner would have been felled by a flying shield early on in his obstinacy, at which point Captain America would have turned his attention to the real problem: Nazis with supernatural powers. Yet despite the abundant potential for social commentary or simple self-conscious satire, this plodding film makes no bold statements, provides little fodder for even old-fashioned escapism, and amounts to little more than a strangely compelling, unfulfilled promise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It could fairly be said that the Harry Potter books and movies are  to our generation what the Beatles were to our parents. What began in  June 1997 with just 500 printed copies of J.K. Rowling’s original “Harry  Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” concluded this summer almost  exactly fourteen years later with a film that grossed $168.5 million on  its opening weekend. The set of seven books has become the bestselling  series of all time, with 450 million copies sold, and has been  translated into 67 languages. The intensity of fanatical Pottermania has  only grown as successive cohorts of children grew old enough to deal  with its morbid themes.
As Rowling became conscious of her growing fanbase, she began  making small concessions to our impatience in the days leading up to the  publication of a new installment—character names, chapter titles, and  other tantalizing details were released even as the new book itself was  viciously guarded until its official release date. It is to her credit  that the plot of the series did not capitulate to avid readers’ wild  demands; indeed, the only stamp that popularity seems to have left on  the last few books of the series is their length. Yet the eighth movie  of the Warner Bros. series, even more so than the book on which it is  based, seems to speak volumes specifically to us college-aged men and  women old enough to have eagerly anticipated the release of every Potter  book and movie since “Philosopher’s Stone.” With the final installment  of the film franchise, director David Yates and his creative team have  constructed a deliciously dark conclusion to the series, built entirely  around the theme of letting go.
As the cinematic counterpart to just the conclusion of the last  book of the Potter series, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part  2” revels in its freedom to focus on the action-packed splendor of a  good old-fashioned castle siege without having to worry about dramatic  buildup or the explanation of fantastical minutiae. The film begins in  media res, with nary a production company logo or opening credit to be  seen, with a shot of dark wizard Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) robbing a  fresh tomb. Yates makes it clear from the start that this is a movie  with great tragic gravitas, not a gimmicky adaptation of a children’s  book replete with cloying magical quirks and cozy fireside chats in the  Gryffindor Common Room. This is a movie in which the entire magical  world we have come to know and love implodes before our very eyes. One  can’t help but feel a strange, convulsive excitement as symbol after  symbol of childhood gaiety and security—the Quidditch pitch, the Room of  Requirement, the bridge on which Lupin (David Thewlis) and Harry  (Daniel Radcliffe) once bonded—burn to the ground. Rowling giveth, and  Rowling taketh away, and with every newly crumbling antediluvian edifice  a little part of the Potter world dies.
And each part dies, of course, in spectacularly expensive fashion.  “A lot of Hollywood films tend to be bloated, bombastic, loud,” Yates  told the British magazine The Observer in 2007, a couple years after  signing on to the Potter project. “At the same time, I do like the  infrastructure of making a blockbuster; it’s like having a big train  set.” If a blockbuster is a big train set, then “Deathly Hallows – Part  2” is the TGV. The special effects of the film are an absolute triumph,  from the reassuringly solid crunch as the titanic stone guardians of  Hogwarts fall into rank and file to protect their home to the foggy  green narcotic cloud of the Imperio curse as it slithers into the  crooked nose of a remarkably realistic goblin. At one point, after a  squadron of wizards magically erects a shimmering electric-blue  hemisphere of a shield around the castle, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch)  aptly remarks, “It’s very impressive, isn’t it?”
For the most part, Eduardo Serra’s cinematography shows off these  effects to their best advantage. The camera’s movement fortifies the  magical fabric of the film as it zooms through invisibility cloaks and  portraits concealing tunnels to give a sense of the secret and otherwise  invisible structure of Potter’s universe. At times, however, Serra’s  dramatic choices—including hackneyed slants and sways—distract attention  from the action of the film. Alexandre Desplat’s original score, on the  other hand, consistently complements the rich visual tapestry of the  movie without overdoing it. One haunting choral motif, first heard at  the absolute beginning of the film when Voldemort finds the wand that  can make him master of death, returns in an elegant reprise at his own  demise near the end. Periods of silence, too, are well-placed to evoke  the emptiness felt in the wake of great destruction.
Such technical mastery, however, would be nothing without the  company of some of the best actors England has to offer. Of all his  performances over the course of the Harry Potter series, Alan Rickman’s  latest portrayal of Snape is by far the most multidimensional and  moving. He is equally powerful in Snape’s supercilious and guarded  public guise and as the sensitive, fragile private man that emerges in  this last film. The full revelations of Snape’s loyalty to Dumbledore  (Michael Gambon) and his deep, unrequited love for Lily Potter  (Geraldine Somerville) paint a tragic and moving vision of the  complications in his relationship with Harry. Ralph Fiennes, as usual,  is a perfect embodiment of the cruel ego of Voldemort, and Helena Bonham  Carter deserves particular recognition for her astonishingly realistic  appropriation of Hermione’s mannerisms during the short Polyjuice Potion  scene in which the young witch impersonates Bellatrix Lestrange.
That said, there remains a disparity between the skill of the  older, prestigious stage actors that the Harry Potter film enterprise  has been so successful in attracting and the greener talent recruited to  portray the three main protagonists. Emma Watson’s Hermione remains  somewhat flat and one-dimensional, while Daniel Radcliffe almost looks  as though he’s constantly trying to remember his next line. Rupert Grint  has his weak moments, although the guttural howl he lets forth upon  seeing his dead brother for the first time is truly striking.
The flaws of the film are minor, but not few in number. Most  noticeable is the weak and stilted dialogue, which somehow rests well in  the mouth of an actor like Ciarán Hinds but shines out in all its  awkward glory in that of, say, Radcliffe. Repeated moments of clunky  exposition become distracting and almost laughable by the end of the  film. Likewise, the staging is often corny and overly calculated, as in  the stiffly choreographed Great Hall scene in which characters group  themselves quite obviously in terms of allegiance; the hackneyed slo-mo  crawl-off that takes place between Harry and Voldemort during their  duel; or any number of scenes in which Harry converses seriously in the  foreground of a shot while Ron and Hermione linger uselessly in the  shadow of a doorway behind him. Even hair and make-up, used to such  wonderful effect in magical creatures, has its weaker points. Aberforth  quite clearly sports penciled eyebrows, and Snape looks like a drag  queen in the great swaths of dark eyeshadow piled on by the make-up  team. Hermione doesn’t seem to have aged one jot “nineteen years later”  in the epilogue, and there is a conspicuous lack of ruffled hair on all  characters throughout the long and gruesome castle siege.
Other moments one might be tempted to call weaknesses in the film  are those in which the plot deviates from that of the book. Ideas are  attributed to different characters; the timeline of events is slightly  twisted; and the complexities of certain subplots, most notably the  subplot in which Neville (Matthew Lewis) might just as easily have taken  Harry’s place as Voldemort’s arch-nemesis, are entirely glossed over in  what seems to be an attempt to save time. It is indeed a shame that  certain debates and controversies, which lend the events of the book a  higher grade of realism, must be omitted. Yet the healthy 130-minute run  time seems worth it, and avid readers will likely be appeased by nods  to their favorite minor dramatic threads. Yet on the other hand, one  might even have hoped that more of the book be left out of the movie;  what’s silly on the page is—unsurprisingly—just as silly on camera. The  sickeningly saccharine epilogue, complete with cringe-worthy inherited  nomenclature, unfortunately made it past the cuts. Its naïve optimism  clashes terribly with the macabre sobriety of the rest of the film, just  like confectioner’s sugar on a freshly cut New York strip.
For it is precisely the lack of any kind of feel-good factor that  makes this last installment in the Harry Potter epic so compelling. This  is no longer a story about magic itself, but about childhood and its  bittersweet demise. The most moving moments of the film are encounters  with human aging and transience; the gravelly timbre of old Ollivander’s  voice strikes the same mournful chord as Harry’s wobbly tremors as he  speaks face-to-face with the ghosts of his dead relatives and friends.  Yet alongside the end of youth something is gained: a final triumph over  the childish caprice so clearly delineated in the serpentine lines of  Voldemort’s eerily pale face, and perhaps even a little perspective on  what has gone before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lately, there have been some rather terrible franchise reboots  occupying box offices, from Disney’s “Tron: Legacy,” to “Clash of the  Titans.” But those failures pale in comparison to the wreck that was  2009’s “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” which was universally panned by  critics and seemingly left its franchise for dead. Surprisingly, though,  Matthew Vaughn’s “X-Men: First Class” succeeds in being everything that  “Origins” was not: exciting, deep, and coherent. “First Class” delves  into the relationships and back-stories of some of the most notable  characters in the X-Men universe—namely Charles Xavier/Professor X  (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender)—and   succeeds in complicating an aging franchise without sacrificing the  characteristic sense of action and adventure of the X-Men movies.
The standout features of “First Class” are the dark and  oft-disturbing origin stories of the mutants that later come to be known  as the X-Men, and the fraught relationship between Xavier and  Lehnsherr. Instead of gamma rays and spider bites—the catalysts of  lesser films of similar bent—“First Class” gives its characters  emotional, rather than supernatural, coloring. The cast includes a  little girl who can only survive by stealing food because the world  doesn’t accept her appearance, and a boy who watches as a man murders  his mother in a concentration camp.
Thus, even though the film’s characters are not homo sapiens per  se, there is something distinctly human about the pain they are forced  to endure due to the world’s intolerance. And due to the characters’  unmistakable humanity, the conflict between the good-hearted Xavier and  the jaded, embittered Lehnsherr is powerfully endowed with moral  ambiguity. “First Class” is more than the standard struggle between good  and evil found in most superhero movies. Instead, it is about two  equally valid but radically different world views. Xavier—ever the  optimist—refuses to turn his back on the humans, while Lehnsherr refuses  to continue to allow humanity to oppress him and those like him. The  uniqueness of “First Class” is that it gives the audience the chance to  assess the morality of both viewpoints without passing judgment itself.
Another triumph for “First Class” is its fresh-faced cast. James  McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence (Raven/Mystique) give  the 48-year-old franchise a new look and bring a youthful energy to the  film that hasn’t been present in previous iterations. At one point in  the movie, the mutants even throw a dorm party of sorts, complete with  funky ’60s music and someone dangling upside-down from the ceiling. This  departure from the norm will surely help the franchise expand its  fanbase and keep the X-Men story relevant.
Not that the film is without the occasional misstep. As  entertaining as “First Class” is, anybody completely unfamiliar with the  X-Men franchise will likely be thoroughly mystified by it.  Unfortunately, fluency with the story—the mission of Professor X, the  conflict between Magneto’s Brotherhood of Mutants and the X-Men—is  required to understand the significance of the characters’ back-stories.  Without knowledge of the events that lie ahead, the background provided  in the movie simply will not mean as much to the audience. And while  the relationship between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr is thoroughly  developed, their connections with other characters often leave a lot to  be desired. Take, for example, the romance between Xavier and  government operative Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) that culminates in a  kiss at film’s close, despite the lack of build-up and explanation as to  how this attraction came to be in the first place. But the strengths of  “First Class” far outweigh these scattered weaknesses.
Perhaps the reason that “First Class” was able to far outshine its  predecessor is that it once again carries the classic X-Men mantra of  tolerance. Ever since the first X-Men comic debuted in 1963 in the midst  of heightened racial strife in the United States, its message of  acceptance has continued to be relevant in an ever-divided society. For  its part, “First Class” suggests that the key to surviving in a world  where it is still difficult to be different is to foster a sense of  belonging, much like Xavier attempts to do with the mutants by  constantly reminding them that they are not alone in their struggle to  be accepted into society. With this poignant message, a winning cast and  a compelling plot, “X-Men: First Class” is a breath of fresh air in a  franchise that has long needed some kind of mutation of its own.

As the screen settles on a sunlit Southern kitchen, the interviewer  asks her question: “What does it feel like to raise a white child, when  your own child’s at home being looked after by somebody else?” The  maid, Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), begins, “it feels...”, but her  expression becomes clouded and she trails off. It’s the sort of  uncomfortable moment emblematic of the “The Help.” Though the film—based  on the book by Kathryn Stockett—takes for its subject the stories of  the lives of maids working in Jackson, Miss. in the 1960s, it is not a  means of scrupulously documenting the difficulties of their lives.  Rather, the film tells a story about how these difficulties affect the  lives of the maids and their relationships.
The storyline is not that revolutionary: a young college student,  Eugenia “Skeeter” Phelan (Emma Stone), returns home to the South with  sky-high journalistic aspirations, gets a job at the local paper, and  then slowly grows conscious of some of the difficulties of the  African-American maids, in particular those who work for her friends.  She begins a book telling the stories of these maids, predictably  causing outrage in the community.
“The Help” offers a breadth-oriented rather than a depth-oriented  approach to this narrative. There are a lot of maids, and a large  assortment of other characters as well, and most of them are extremely  well acted and painted with realism and clarity. The exceptions to this  are the budding journalist Skeeter, and the film’s villain, Hilly  Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard). Hilly is racist, pouty, and popular, and  wears cute dresses, and that’s about all there is to her. Skeeter is,  of course, a “strong and independent” woman with fierce opinions and  educated ideals. Though she is in some ways the protagonist of the film,  her role is arguably more functional than substantive, existing to  connect and coordinate the movie’s portrayal of some far more  interesting characters, such as the maids and her mother. In this way,  her character becomes problematic—she is given just enough detail to get  in the way of the other, more interesting stories, without being nearly  as engaging. To the film’s credit, Skeeter is portrayed realistically;  she’s not quite a saint because she’s writing the book partly to impress  her editors in New York, though she’s certainly passionate about her  cause. But her realism doesn’t quite endow her with depth.
For all its flaws, though, “The Help” is at heart a movie that  relies on its characters, and as such showcases some well filled roles.  The most important of these is Aibileen, the maid whom Skeeter first  interviews, and the film’s narrator. Viola Davis’s character provides a  great counterpoint to Skeeter; she is a strong woman in and of herself,  not solely because she says what she’s thinking and has great  aspirations. Other standout performances include Skeeter’s mother,  played by Allison Janney, and Aibileen’s friend Minny, portrayed by  Octavia Spencer. These actors’ gifts allow them to flesh out vivid  characters even in a crowd of colorful roles. Indeed, aforementioned  exceptions aside, almost all of the acting is superb in “The Help,” and  the film’s performers succeed in bringing out the tapestry of lives that  the story seeks to weave.
And it is a beautiful sort of portrait, though it’s not altogether  satisfying. The movie takes an interesting artistic angle by portraying  the deep South unconventionally—that is, instead of presenting the sort  of exhaustive, troubling inwardness of the Southern gothic conceit, it  shows us the paroxysm of an entire community, an entire demographic.   But the trouble with this bird’s-eye approach is that although the  maid characters like Aibileen and Minny are wonderfully done, they just  don’t have enough presence in the film. To be fair, the point of “The  Help” isn’t to delve exhaustively into any one particular character’s  storyline—but by casting so wide a narrative net, the film skates a  little bit too lightly over the issues it tries to portray. We never see  the brutality of Aibileen’s story, we only hear her recount it, and  though her face reveals to us some of the pain that she has endured,  such passing acknowledgement seems inadequate in the face of some of the  fluffier parts of the film. A bunch of white women gossiping about  Skeeter’s chances of nabbing a husband just aren’t a satisfying  replacement for a serious account of the story’s slighted suffering. For  this reason, “The Help” proves both an entertaining yet unsettlingly  uneven affair.

In her sparkling white-walled office at the Harvard Dance Center, Jill Johnson described the study of épaulement: the placement of the torso and arms in classical ballet technique. “It alarms me that classical ballet technique is so often portrayed as a dogmatic practice,” she said as she gracefully rotated her shoulders in demonstration. “Épaulement is a demonstration of tremendously beautiful balanced and torqued configurations within the body. [They] can be translated, transposed and taken apart ... quite like those alignments found in the structures of architecture—or philosophy, or math, or science,” she said.
This compelling description of épaulement is fitting evidence of the artistic perspective that Jill Johnson has to offer Harvard’s community. Appointed by the Office for the Arts at Harvard, Johnson succeeds Elizabeth Weil Bergmann as the new Harvard University Dance Director. Her career is prolific: a school graduate and former soloist with the National Ballet of Canada, Johnson went on to become a principal dancer with Frankfurt Ballet—the company of William Forsythe, one of today’s most renowned contemporary ballet choreographers. Johnson’s decade-long career in Forsythe’s company transformed into a 20-year collaboration, and she continues to stage Forsythe’s work for companies around the world.
Johnson is also a choreographer and teacher in her own right, balancing a dance career between the worlds of professional dance and academia. She worked with dancers at Princeton University, Yale University, The Julliard School, The Alvin Ailey School, and The Joffrey Ballet School, among many others, before accepting her new position at Harvard. “I feel a tremendous amount of responsibility for my art form,” she said, “and Harvard presented, amongst many things, an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to dance education.”
One of Johnson’s first priorities as Dance Director is to open up the Harvard Dance Program to a more global approach to dance education. “I hope to have guest artists from all over the world, including Ohad Naharin, William Forsythe, Desmond Richardson, Dwight Rhoden, Andrea Miller, and Mikko Nissinen,” she said. Johnson’s first guest artist is Danielle Agami, an Israeli dancer and choreographer who will give a master class on September 9 on Gaga technique, a dance form developed by Israeli contemporary choreographer Ohad Naharin. “I’ve quickly learned we must delineate this Gaga from the Lady, whom we love—albeit in terms of a different kind of artistic expression,” Johnson said with a laugh.
Johnson hopes to extend these projects to the greater Boston community as well. She plans to bring Ronald K. Brown—the choreographer of the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) current production of “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess”—for a master class open to both Harvard students and high school students involved with the A.R.T.
In addition to leading these collaborations as Dance Director, Johnson will also facilitate interaction between Harvard’s Dance and Music departments as a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Music. “Dance and music are natural allies,” said Alexander Rehding, Fanny Peabody Professor of Music and Chair of the Music Department. “Musicians study ballets through scores, and dancers study ballets through the choreography. It will be nice for our departments to study both aspects of the dance together ... Jill could not have come at a better time,” Rehding said. As Senior Lecturer, Johnson will be teaching two courses. This fall, she will be leading Music 105r: “Fundamentals of Improvisation and Composition: Dance,” a class about dance improvisation that will include input from jazz colleagues who will present fundamentals of their own musical improvisation. In the spring, she will teach Music 103r: “Dance Workshop Process: Forsythe.” This spring course will be an in-depth study of Forsythe’s work, ‘One Flat Thing, reproduced,’ and will culminate in her choreography of an original work. “I’d like to bring a spirit of curiosity to my classes—dancing is about ideas,” Johnson said.
Through both the Harvard Dance and Music departments, Johnson aims to integrate her expertise from the professional dance world with the wealth of resources at a research university. “Often, I get the sense that arts education is still seen as separate from education,” she said, “and I would love for there to be a time when the distinction is no longer apparent. We will uphold and develop the performance aspect of dance, but in terms of dance history and other artistic research, we can tap into the abundance of Harvard’s resources to explore an entirely different facet of dance learning,” she continued.
Whether it be choreographic work, musical collaboration, or archiving dancers’ stories, Jill Johnson looks to what she calls “the points of connection” where academic and professional artistic life collide. “It is citizenship that is really needed in dance, not perfection,” she said. “I think the time is past for dancers to be partitioned behind the techniques in which they have been trained. It is just a great time to have conversations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Old Man Pericles, the wisest character in Horacio Castellanos Moya’s latest novel “Tyrant Memory,” has a cigar in one hand, a glass of whiskey in the other. “The difference, Chélon, is that you believe there’s something beyond this, an afterlife, that’s why you can forgive. I don’t,” he mutters to the epilogue’s narrator.
Forgiveness and the afterlife—these are two things that might bring a semblance of peace to the closing pages of a novel ravaged by death and betrayal. But it is the collective memory of El Salvador in its years of despotism, and individual memories of personal hurts and betrayals, which prohibit forgiveness and peace. Indeed the epigraph, an extract from Canetti’s “House of Flies,” implores: “Would it be better if nothing remained of our lives, nothing at all? If death meant our instant obliteration in the minds of all who have had images of us?”
“Tyrant Memory,” translated by Katherine Silver, is a novel of revolution: of curfews, firing squads, illicit meetings, and ecstatic bravado in moments of hope and success. But it isn’t a novel about the romance of revolution, or the success of idealistic youth as they successfully depose the Nazi-warlock known as “the man.” Its bravado thinly veils a tangle of corruption which has spread so deep that members of the failed military coup are as perverse as the regime they tried to topple.
The novel takes place in the last few months of the militant regime of Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, who was the presidentof El Salvador from 1931 until 1944. It opens with the military coup of 1944, following its rise and fall, and spans the weeks before the eventual deposition of “the warlock” with a city-wide strike in San Salvador. The book follows the revolution through the eyes of Haydée, a wealthy socialite and wife to a political prisoner, whose motives are perhaps the purest in the book: she is simply a mother and wife attempting to protect her family. Interspersed with Haydée’s journal entries are sequences of narrative related by two fugitives from the failed coup. This component is more crudely painted than Haydée’s diary, and initially seems out of place. However, its protagonists—who are as comic as they are grotesque—glaringly highlight the ambiguity of the failed coup: the most pressing, violent demands of the “heroic insurgents” are for alcohol and cigarettes rather than peace and justice.
It is, however, in the epilogue that Castellanos Moya’s latest novel acquires its multidimensionality. Told from the perspective of a peripheral character, the closing pages swing between memory and the present day of 1973—nearly 40 years after the president’s fall. The section centers on Pericles as he confronts his own impending death. His and Chélon’s meditations on death and man’s absolute end provides a nostalgic, Heideggerian culmination to a novel in which death has been treated entirely as a form of political action rather than a personal experience.
In Haydée’s diary, murders and death are ubiquitious; every few pages the number of fatalities multiplies. However, as is the case in moments of human depravity, she is no longer able to conceive of the death of the individual. Each death becomes either a number, or a cog in the deposition of “the man.” This is the case for Haydee’s narrative, strikingly immediate in its tenseand its snappy sentence structure, which moves from death to death in much the same way as Haydée herself rotates through a vibrant social calendar of lunches and parties. Thus the epilogue succeeds in upending this state of affairs: Pericles’ personal crisis in the face of his own absolute end reflects back upon the many deaths during the revolutionary period. Here, the horror is actualized in a way that its mere telling in Haydée’s diary never achieves.
Despite the novel’s title, the story is largely devoid of memory or fragments of the past: Haydée’s diary is  composed entirely of her present. Thus, the reader is thrown into the tumultuous streets of San Salvador. Haydée’s narrative, which lurches from event to event, is bedecked in characters and names we barely have the time to process before being flung urgently onwards. It is effective. The reader is left just as overwhelmed and confused as Haydée.
Herein lies one of the novel’s flaws. Haydée’s section, urgent, vibrant and wrenchingly poignant at times, can founder in painful clichés as Haydée struggles to convey emotions almost alien in their extremity. “Our hearts in our mouths;” “A day from hell;” such phraseology can appear trite in the face of the horrifying events described. However, Haydée’s narrative includes a handful of sentences so poetic it is easy to ignore moments of cliché: “The city felt dismal, as if the wind were fear, blowing through the streets.”
This poetic clarity is perhaps most keenly felt in the epilogue about Pericles and the artist Chélon, which indulges in imaginative diversions for the first time. This section pulls the creases of the novel together. Nevertheless it is the deepest flaw of the novel that this poetic discourse and philosophical enquiry into death only comes at its conclusion. It feels clumsily attached, and the reader is left wishing it had appeared earlier, so that one might read the other sections of the novel with Chélon’s insights at the forefront of one’s thoughts.
Castellanos Moya’s novel addresses the success of communal uprising, and the perversity of the human condition. It does so with wit, black humour and creativity—although its methods are crude at times. Throughout, the novel seeks a method of dealing with death as a component of the human condition: Haydée’s religious faith; Chélon’s occultist leanings; and Pericles’ cynical acceptance of “no return.” It does not succeed in proffering any concrete resolution; rather, “Tyrant Memory” serves as a testament to the endurance of human action, to the knowledge that regardless of death itself, our actions are permanent and will remain—in the memory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard often finds itself the central focus of artistic projects, ranging from Facebook docudrama “The Social Network” to the superfluously fictitious film—and now Broadway musical—“Legally Blonde.” While Hollywood tends to obsess over the venerable university’s more opulent stories, Tony A. Speciale, a New York-based theater director, spent eight years developing the production “Unnatural Acts,” a deeply disturbing true story about Harvard’s less savory side. Conceived and co-authored by Speciale, “Unnatural Acts” tells the story of Harvard’s Secret Court of 1920, a disciplinary body that interrogated and eventually expelled a number of male students and staff for their involvement in homosexual activities.
“I remember exactly where I was when I first read about Harvard’s Secret Court,” Speciale says, “and it felt like a massive truck had hit me in the chest.” In the summer of 2003, OUT Magazine printed full coverage of the story that was gaining mass media attention across America, and Speciale found himself increasingly intrigued by the developments.
The OUT article told of a series of three stories published in The Crimson in December 2002 by Amit R. Paley ’04 detailing the witch-hunt, which was orchestrated by a hastily assembled group of administrators known as the Secret Court in May and June of 1920. As soon as Speciale read the article, he knew he wanted to make the story into a show. “I filed away the OUT article for a future project, and continued to collect and add to the file over the years,” he says.
In May 1920 Cyril Wilcox, a College sophomore on academic probation, blocked his bedroom door and released gas from the lighting fixtures, killing himself in his sleep. After Wilcox’s death his brother, Lester, received letters addressed to Cyril that divulged intimate details of Cyril’s sexual activities.
Appalled, Lester demanded that the President of the University, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, bring cases against the men Cyril had named as participating in homosexual acts. Through violence, threats, rumors and confession, 38 men were brought before the Secret Court and 14 were eventually convicted of “homosexualism.”
It wasn’t until 2005 that Speciale began to work with a group of actors on the project, beginning in an improvisational setting. “It was exciting going into this project without an initial script. We were writing and exploring the play on our feet, which was exciting and liberating, as the ideas of the directors and actor mingle together,” Speciale says.
One of the actors in the project was Harvard graduate Jess R. Burkle ’06, who found the six hour-long improvisations a new and insightful way to work on a developing play. “It was like writing with a Ouija board: the group would move it one way or another way and we could just go with it. It helped create a unique and intimate role, as we worked so closely together as an ensemble for over a year,” Burkle says.
Over the next few years, the show was workshopped, performed, and rewritten. In 2011, the Classic Stage Company offered the opportunity to have the project honed with a group of six writers and ultimately have the play, now known as “Unnatural Acts,” performed as part of the theater’s summer season.
The finalized script had to ensure the right balance between fiction and real-life events. “I was always fully aware that this was a dramatic imagining of true events, rather than a docudrama,” Speciale says. “We took liberties with dialogue, since everything they were saying was merely speculative.” Even with the artistic liberties taken, the whole team made sure they grounded the show around the facts they had gathered.
For Burkle, this presented an unusual challenge for character development. “My philosophy was in creating a character that served the dramatic purpose of the story as a whole, in order to convey a larger truth,” he says. According to the actor, if any individual focused too much on defending the actions of their character, then the show would be crippled.
Despite any artistic flourishes, those intimately connected with the case found the show fair and compelling. Bob Percy, grandson of Lester Wilcox and nephew of Cyril, saw the show as a resounding success. “There are some well-dressed men up there looking down on your efforts with great satisfaction,” he says.
The Harvard community may not have to wait too long to learn about Harvard’s Secret Courts. “Cambridge is the most important city for this story to be told in,” Speciale says, “but we’re working to get the financial backing to bring the show on tour.”
The director thinks “Unnatural Acts” could contribute to the Cambridge theater scene, but he doesn’t see it as a social mission or a propaganda piece. “The show is essentially the intersection of art and life. Art showing treatment of homosexuals in that period,” Speciale says. “I never wanted to piss anyone off, especially the families, I just wanted to tell their stories.”

“Porgy and Bess” has always been a controversial piece, and it has been both claimed and rejected by the African-American community over its lifetime. The American Repertory Theater’s new rendition, directed by Diane M. Paulus ’87, faces its own additional controversy over its radical reinterpretation of the original. In converting the opera into a musical, Paulus has updated its language and reimagined a number of characters. These changes, among others, prompted Stephen Sondheim to write a critical open letter in the New York Times: “Advertise it honestly as ‘Diane Paulus’s Porgy & Bess,’” he wrote scathingly, “and to hell with the real one.” Despite the strife it has caused in the theater community, Paulus’s reinterpretation, which runs until October 2 on the Loeb Mainstage, hits many high notes. Vibrantly emotional performances by Norm Lewis (Porgy), Audra McDonald (Bess), and supporting cast coalesce effectively and the show’s technical aspects are refreshing and appropriate. However, the show’s pacing and transitions seem to have suffered in the conversion from opera to musical; the tonal oscillations between manic and tragic sometimes feel contrived.
DuBose Heyward and George and Ira Gershwin debuted “Porgy and Bess” in 1935. A tale of impoverished blacks living on “Catfish Row” in 1920s South Carolina, it is simultaneously immersed in racial controversy and lauded as the Gershwins’ magnum opus. Bess, the fast-living girlfriend of Crown (Phillip Boykin), falls in love with beggar and cripple Porgy after Crown violently murders one of Catfish Row’s inhabitants and is forced to flee. However, Crown’s eventual return and murder at the hands of Porgy, as well as Sporting Life’s (David Alan Grier) seductive siren call of hedonism and cocaine (“Happy Dust”), compel Bess to make a choice between leaving Catfish Row and staying with Porgy.
McDonald plays Bess as both a wild-eyed Happy Dust addict and a woman desperately wanting to live a “decent life.” Her voice seamlessly floats between operatic highs and bitter, grating lows, meshing well with Lewis’s Porgy (“Bess, You Is My Woman Now”) in ethereal duets. Her stage presence is packed with kinetic wrath, but also descends on occasion into a strangely vulnerable and childish attitude.
Lewis’s voice serves as the perfect complement—smooth, strong, and assured in contrast to McDonald’s sporadic trills. “I’ve Got Plenty of Nothing,” Porgy’s joyful claim that he is content with his material poverty—“got my gal, got my Lord, got my song”—highlights Lewis’s purposeful tone, along with the outstanding closing number “I’m On My Way.”
Boykin’s Crown is the brash villain of the piece, but his characterization undergoes a drastic shift from the Gershwins’ version. Originally a more menacing presence, Boykin plays Crown as a confused, impulsive addict. This interpretation conflicts uncomfortably with some of the best moments in the stage design, which features a semi-circular backdrop that is lifted asymmetrically to create the feel of a spinning hurricane. When Crown returns from hiding, the backdrop lopsidedly rises to reveal his outline in the pouring rain, prepared to take Bess away from Catfish Row; however, his confusion and immediate departure to look for bereaved soon-to-be widow Clara (Nikki Renée Daniels) dampens what could have been a more striking moment. The other technical aspects shine, as the orchestra handles the difficult score superbly, and the costuming and choreography blend naturally even though there are often a dozen people on the stage.
As comic relief, Grier’s Sporting Life and NaTasha Yvette Williams’s Mariah create the memorable “I Hate Your Strutting Style” where Mariah chases Sporting Life around the stage with a brandished knife for peddling Happy Dust. However, the upbeat interludes provided by Grief and Williams perpetuate the show’s greatest failing: its vacillating emotional timbre. The original opera is certainly filled with ups and downs. As soon as Porgy or Bess gains something, it is cruelly taken away. However, in Paulus’s rendition, the oscillation between upbeat and emotional numbers seems inappropriately abrupt. When Bess comes to pay her respects to Serena (Bryonha Maria Parham) after Crown kills her husband, Parham sings the tragic “My Man’s Gone Now,” a beautiful, operatic dirge. The transition from this into “Leaving for the Promised Land,” a gospel in which Catfish Row accepts Bess, goes from zero to 60 in tempo as the cast suddenly begin to dance around the corpse. Similarly, the transition between the climactic “Bess, You Is My Woman Now” and “Oh, I Can’t Sit Down” is rushed and seems to exist solely to finish the first act on a dancing number.
“The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” functions best as a showcase of Lewis and McDonald’s impressive performances. The technical aspects are top-notch, and the supporting cast shines; the updated language doesn’t seem out of place or distracting, and each musical number on its own is electric. However, the transitions between the numbers distracts from the overarching love story within, and some of the original’s coherence has been lost in the conversion.

Edie Meidav’s “Lola, California” is a veritable epic of a novel, in which one word will never suffice when a paragraph can be written, and any omission is a deathly oversight. The book careens wildly between grandiosity and humbleness, and bounces constantly between cliché and emotional honesty to result in a confusing and exhausting reading experience.
The primary plotline follows the lives of Lana and Rose, two women coming of age in Berkeley, Calif. It is a tale of finding one’s identity in a chaotic world. Lana, the protagonist of the story, is the daughter of two hippie professors deeply engaged with the self-help movement. Rose is a self-searching foster child, a girl craving normalcy, something she futilely attempts to find in Lana’s life. The two girls dream up a new being, an amalgamation of both of them, a girl who embodies the best of Rose and Lana. Interpreting their lives through the lens of their favorite songs, they become a being they call “Lola,” an homage to the transvestite titular character in the Kinks’ most famous song. This being encompasses the two of them, combining the best of each girl in one identity behind which they can hide.
This idea of Lola, the togetherness upon which they can rely, is the linchpin of the book as the girls wander, at once apart and together, through their lives, always returning to each other in moments of trial. This unity persists through the novel’s vast array of dates and times and places, transcending the book’s deeply fractured plot.
Rose and Lana—together becoming Lola—are complex and deeply recognizable because they represent a fantasy of female experience: they are everything that 17-year-old girls dream of being, and everything that 35-year-old women remember themselves as. There is something deeply universal about the relationship they share with each other that manages to negate the wildly fantastic plotline. Although their stories are extravagant—incorporating nudist health spas, year-long jaunts through Europe, and a stint as high-class prostitutes while attending NYU—they are grounded because the girls experience them as normal. Instead of being tempted to disengage from the more wild elements and approach them with absurdity, Meidav contextualizes, approaching psychedelic, larger-than-life experiences in a down-to-earth, realistic prose style.
Lana’s and Rose’s experiences are universal, and they feel like women that you could know, women that you could have been. Near the beginning she describes them as “newly set loose on the world, fairly oblivious to everyone else. Masters or meteors: two girls at seventeen.” In many ways, despite the long timeline of the story, this is Meidav’s ultimate goal, to capture the experience of being a 17-year-old girl. This is where the novel is most successful. That experience, that feeling, is distilled perfectly, with just the right balance of nostalgia and blunt honesty.
Alongside Lola, Meidav also explores the story of Vic, Lana’s professor-cum-prophet of a father who is dying in jail, on death row for the murder of his wife. In many ways, he embodies the glue holding the friends together, as well as the adversity they face in a male-dominated world in which they are trying to live and thrive. Nevertheless, he often seems to get short shrift. Whether intentionally or not, his worldviews and his body of work are so ridiculous that his character ceases to be real. His motivations are never adequately explained, which makes his sections some of the most confusing of the novel, since it is impossible to grasp his character as a real person.
Although Meidav’s female characters can be truly beautiful, her entire cast of male characters often comes off as flat. They are caricatures, used to further her story about women, to validate their existence instead of to have lives and realities of their own. The book’s fathers, brothers, boyfriends, and fiancés are more or less interchangeable, and the superficiality of this aspect of the novel makes it more difficult to process the depth and realism of the female characters’ experiences. This is unfortunate because “Lola, alifornia” is so uniquely about the female experience, about attempting to exist in a world that undervalues and exploits girls, and does not take seriously the traumas that these particular characters face. The instances of sexual assault are frequent and casual, and although these events in themselves do make a point, Meidav has missed an opportunity. When the men who are abusing the women are the same depthless, bland ones who are caring for them, there can be no dimension to Meidav’s exploration of sexual assault.
There are beautiful and evocative moments in this novel. Some are even heart-wrenching but their power is diluted by Meidav’s circumlocution. “Lola, California” could easily have been half its length and still have been just as somber and beautiful. The middle drags, with several chapters at a time offering nothing more than meandering descriptions and platitudes about growing up female in America. Rose is especially shortchanged in this regard, as her plots are often secondary to Lana’s, used as nothing more than ways to further the primary story of the book. Meidav’s decision here is, once again, unfortunate, as it makes it easy to dislike a very well-written character. Meidav’s prose is incisive and insightful, especially when she describes the girls’ brief stint as prostitutes. But these flashes of insight can often feel muddled by the sheer amount of material through which they try to shine.
“Lola, California” is, in many ways, like a life. There are moments of transcendence and moments of glorious truth, but there are also long stretches of the mundane, of itchy boredom punctuated by abstract truisms. If only Meidav had leaned less heavily on cliché so that the moments of authentic life could be left to stand on their own, without being cheapened by the book’s excess baggage.

Banana Yoshimoto chose her first name because she likes banana flowers. Her books are littered with characters with premonitory powers, inspired by people she claims to have met in real life. She gathers her own ideas from dreams. But even though Yoshimoto might dabble in the whimsical and the light, her most recent novel, “The Lake,” deals deftly with grief, death, and fear during an intense romance. Translated by Michael Emmerich, it stands out amongst other, fluffier romances for its crisply described settings, realistic and reserved characters, and intelligent meditations about the nature of intimacy.
“The Lake” centers around young muralist Chihiro’s narration of her mother’s recent death and the development of her relationship with the obsessive academic Nakajima. But instead of  romantic storybook heroes, Chihiro and Nakajima are reticent people tormented by loss, drawn to each other because of their mutual habit of gazing out of their apartment windows.
The characters themselves are compatible opposites. Chihiro embodies the sensory artist, living fully in the present, observing the world around her with a wise eye. She is dispassionate about her past in provincial Japan, and paints murals as a way to live fully in her body. Nakajima lives in the past, deeply scarred from mysterious abuse; he is completely a creature of the mind, nearly dying from forgetting to sleep or eat while voraciously studying—a means of coping with his mother’s death. Yoshimoto develops Nakajima and Chihiro’s companionable relationship while also revealing Nakajima’s past, closely related to an otherworldly lake.
While “The Lake” is primarily a romance, Yoshimoto inserts supernatural elements to provide mystery, but these sometimes read as awkward and unnecessary. The most important of these are a brother and sister who live on the eponymous lake, one of whom functions as an oracle who can see the futures and inner desires of Chihiro and Nakajima. Given the refreshing, lighthearted tone of the novel as the couple gets to know one another, having a character that can suddenly divine personalities seems like a cheap way to speed up that process. A more reserved oracle could have kept the eerie tone without taking a major shortcut.
However, while some supernatural elements seem forced, Yoshimoto’s settings—especially the lake itself—are written with such care and realism that they overshadow the flashy dreams and oracles. Chihiro’s Tokyo apartment, the site where she paints her mural, and the hospital where her mother dies are so timeless that when Chihiro and Nakajima finally visit the lake halfway through the novel, the mystical and spiritual locale merely takes its place amongst the novel’s parade of vivid environments.
The greatest strength of “The Lake,” however, lies not in its environments or even its carefully drawn characters, but in how Yoshimoto takes no feeling for granted. She nimbly avoids the preconceived notions, clichés, and traps into which romances often fall. There is no melodramatic unraveling of psyches, no madness, not even hostility. There are just two characters slowly, hesitantly sharing their lives with each other. That uncertainty is the most realistic and compelling aspect of Nakajima and Chihiro’s relationship. Granted, there are moments in “The Lake” that seem too eccentric upon first reading. The novel begins with Nakajima crying during sex; he sleeps with a small metal cooking rack; sometimes, his conversation sounds stilted and inaccessible. However, when Chihiro finds out the reasons behind Nakajima’s odd manner, the revelation provides a satisfying finish to the novel.
Yoshimoto cites Stephen King, Truman Capote, and Augusten Burroughs as her writing influences, and “The Lake” borrows from those authors’ trademark stylistic tics. King’s uncomfortable, lurking darkness, Capote’s lilting cadences, and Burrough’s quirky, familiar diction combine with Yoshimoto’s tactile description and fresh observation in an arresting, readable style. Composed mostly of dialogue and Chihiro’s confident narration, it is a book that can be read once for the romance, twice for the supremely-crafted settings, and thrice for the immutable wisdom in its pages.
While the comparison between Yoshimoto and Haruki Murakami as two successful Japanese surrealists is inevitable, “The Lake” has the finality and accessibility that most Murakami novels avoid. Nakajima and Chihiro’s romance can be summarized by a particularly poignant line—“When someone tells you something big, it’s like you’re taking money from them, and there’s no way it will ever go back to being the way it was. You have to take responsibility for listening.”  With its careful craft and intellectual flavor, Yoshimoto’s latest certainly is “something big.” It is a pleasure to take the responsibility of listening.

As if to celebrate the departure of Irene only hours before, at 6 p.m. last Monday evening music began to echo off the walls of the upper courtyard of the Charles Hotel. No, the Regattabar hadn’t forgotten to close a window. Rather, the Caili O’Doherty Trio, a group of three young jazz musicians from the Berklee College of Music just down the Charles River, entertained both those familiar with the Cambridge jazz scene and unknowing hotel guests with a free two-hour concert in the best weather New England can muster.
The Regattabar is known for attracting some of the most renowned talent in the jazz world, and this young trio is no exception. Caili S. O’Doherty may be a 19-year-old junior at Berklee, but her credentials are already dazzling. Composition and performance awards from DownBeat magazine, a full scholarship to Berklee, and a list of past teachers including some of the biggest names in contemporary jazz—such as Greg Osby and Danilo Perez—suggest that O’Doherty is nothing short of a prodigious talent on the piano. Her trio—including drummer Roberto Giaquinto, originally from Italy, and bassist Shin Sakaino, originally from Japan—sound synchronized and unmistakably professional, a testament to the breadth of their talent and the rigor of their higher education. In presenting performers of this caliber to the broader public, Berklee is attempting to publicize their name and highlight the quality of their programs.
As part of a series of summer concerts known as “Courtyard Series: Berklee at the Regattabar,” this concert represents Berklee’s outreach efforts to the Boston community and beyond, with the philosophy that there’s no better way to advertise Berklee than through the musical talent of its own students. “Many people have been coming back every week, several of them prospective students,” says Ben S. Roberts, producer of the Regattabar series. He describes the origin of the idea three years back, when Michael Borgida, a Berklee student turned staff member, decided it would be great publicity to host concerts throughout the Boston area, including near the Prudential Center, at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), and, of course, at Cambridge’s primary jazz venue, the Regattabar. “The bands have been great, and they’re only getting better,” Borgida says.
Monday’s concert was the last to take place at the Regattabar this summer, but its success suggests that this tradition of free concerts will be back for many summers to come. As the trio progressed through a set of standards, hard bop gems, and some of O’Doherty’s own compositions, the upper courtyard’s many tables filled until listeners lined the planters framing the space. Jeong Kwon, an Arlington resident who passes through the area on her way home from work, knew about the concert series from a concert she had attended last year. “It’s such a great area to have a concert,” she said. The Regattabar pulled out all the stops in making its attendees comfortable by setting up a wine and burger bar both casual and classy in equal measure. Just as the flyers for the series advertised, the event was a perfect mix of “summer music, summer drinks, [and] summer fun.”
The concert became especially fun when the Trio played some of O’Doherty’s original compositions, one of which was the rock-inspired “Stumptown,” featuring a modal, bass-heavy vamp that allowed the musicians to open up far more than in the jazz standards that comprised the majority of the set. In interview, O’Doherty expressed what she tries to bring to her pieces. “I really like incorporating different types of music into my compositions,” she said. “I try to write music that has a simpler form that’s easier to catch on to, something like a verse-chorus.” Such a simpler form in “Stumptown” permitted O’Doherty’s piano solo to develop according to a distinct logic of its own, as short, fragmented phrases gave way to longer, meandering lines. The resulting solo was one of the most exciting parts of the evening, an exquisite example of O’Doherty’s improvisational and compositional prowess.
As the concert came to a close, the Charles Hotel’s upper courtyard fell silent, not to come alive again until 2012. However, the Regattabar concerts are part of the “Berklee Summer in the City,” a much wider series of concerts spread all throughout the Cambridge and Boston areas. There are still many free outdoor concerts scheduled elsewhere, including at the Harvard Longwood Campus, at the corner of Newbury and Exeter Streets, and at the ICA. As Berklee continues to publicize its program, it also provides a unique opportunity for the Boston public to enjoy the sounds of some of its finest musical talent.

The first impression that the Rita J. and Stanley H. Kaplan Family Foundation Gallery makes is that of an art heist: a crowd overpowers the tiny room, blocking the view of any artwork and leaving the impression that they are staring at nothing. As the group dissipates, however, it becomes clear that it is not a crime scene that commands such attention, but a diverse display of jewelry from many different centuries and world regions.
The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) is currently featuring a host of exhibitions, including a few that highlight some of the art world’s most prominent figures. Throughout this fall, the paintings, prints, and drawings of Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, and Odilon Redon, among others, will play an important role in adding variety and allure to the museum’s permanent collection. While the masters may be the first to turn heads, the MFA’s most exciting displays this fall are those featuring neither big names nor the most traditional media. With the Kaplan Gallery’s inaugural display, an impressive showing of African textiles, and the first color photography exhibition to be shown in one of the MFA’s prominent photo galleries, the museum is branching out to celebrate a greater diversity of artistic achievement.
“Jewels, Gems, and Treasures: Ancient to Modern” recently inaugurated the Kaplan Gallery, the MFA’s first room intended exclusively for jewelry. Perhaps the exhibit that resonates most soundly with returning museum-goers, the display examines the notion of what has been considered precious throughout history. It encompasses a wide variety of works, including ancient Egyptian ivory pendants, a 19th-century European jewelry suite made of stuffed hummingbirds, and a 20th century Tiffany’s necklace. Since its opening, both the exhibit and the new gallery seem to have successfully attracted anticipated attention. Says patron Jeanene M. Devlin, “this gallery was long overdue. It’s fantastic that the MFA is finally branching out into something like this.” MFA member Ron Bento expresses a similar sentiment. “The room they chose is probably going to be too small for the popularity that it’s already receiving. The pieces are exquisite—setting aside the materials themselves—because each is so beautifully crafted by hand.”
Another of the current displays is a diverse African textile collection that emphasizes the influence of outside cultures on textile development. The exhibit showcases many traditional adornments such as hats, headdresses, and wraps principally from sub-Saharan cultures, and also highlights the fascinating changes garments have undergone since colonialism. Textiles styled in the traditional fashion, yet featuring designs of Coca Cola cans and computers, are placed alongside the South African Ndebele people’s characteristic beadwork that became a hallmark of Ndebele apparel upon the arrival of Europeans. Devlin says she thoroughly enjoyed the display. “I loved it. There’s so much more to art than painting on canvas, and it’s also great that they show how the global art world is truly integrated through works like these.”
Even in the photographic medium, the MFA seems to be making an effort to try something new. The museum’s Herb Ritts Gallery for Photography is currently featuring its first color exhibition, entitled “Violet Isle: A Photographic Portrait of Cuba by Alex Webb and Rebecca Norris Webb.” A visual essay of sorts, the show imbues everyday scenes of people, animals, and landscapes with the intensity of chromogenic effects. Museum visitor and senior at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Molly A. Kozminsky says she found the works intriguing. “There seems to be a lot of eye contact with the people in the pictures. It makes you wonder what they’re thinking.” Kozminsky also comments on the stark contrast between “Violet Isle” and the adjacent exhibit, an exposition of 19th-century prints and drawings by Redon and fellow French artist Rodolphe Bresdin. “There’s such difference between the black and white etchings that also focus so much on the artists who created them and these photos of nameless people. It makes you think about what’s important in different kinds of art.”
Of course, the current displays that might be considered more conventional still display a wealth of artistic achievement to museum visitors. The aforementioned Bresdin and Redon exhibit provides a probing look into the fantastic worlds of those two artists, just as the show “Modernist Photography: 1910-1950” is a thought-provoking grouping of the innovative work of American photographers from that era. Likewise, the juxtaposition of Lichtenstein’s Rouen cathedrals with the Monet series that inspired them is well worth a visit. Yet it still may be the jewelry, textiles, and chromogenic prints that serve most to inspire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What do Jay-Z, Beyonce, and Justin Vernon, leader of Bon Iver, all have in common? All of them have collaborated with Kanye West and have a penchant for crafting extensive self-mythologies. Until recently, Vernon seemed destined to remain an indie favorite. However, after being featured last year on West’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” and again on “Watch the Throne,” Vernon’s career has taken a sharp turn towards the mainstream. Fortunately, this dose of the limelight has altered only the superficial trappings of Vernon’s sound while leaving intact the raw emotion, lyrical inventiveness, and musical skill that made him so appealing in the first place.
One of the most immediately recognizable shifts in Bon Iver’s sound is the open embrace of modern musical technology that was largely absent on the band’s debut. The songwriting on “For Emma, Forever Ago,” focused primarily on quiet, acoustic folk arrangements. His most recent release, “Bon Iver,” expands Vernon’s compelling sonic palette by adding horns, synths, and pretty much everything in between. Moody album opener “Perth” begins with military drum flourishes and evolves into a sprawling, somber march accented with brassy horn riffs. The album closer “Beth/Rest” opens like a melodramatic 80s synth ballad until Vernon’s mangled vocal track takes over. Despite his rampant adventurousness, though, Vernon manages to retain an indefinable yet instantly recognizable sound.
The artist has also clearly been inspired by his experiences with Kanye West, especially with regard to his vocals. Taking a few cues from his collaborator, he runs his falsetto through a number of alterations and tuning mechanisms. At times, in songs such as “Michicant” and “Hinnom, TX,” it can be difficult to tell whether his voice is pitch-perfect or has been thoroughly Auto-Tuned. On earlier songs, his raw, vulnerable falsetto contributed to the intimacy of his songwriting, but on “Bon Iver,” his pristinely modified vocals create a sense of ghostly, glacial detachment. It’s certainly a different approach, but fortunately it doesn’t sacrifice any of the songwriting’s emotional power.
Some things remain unchanged: Vernon’s lyrics are still just as moody, reflective, and sorrowful as ever. On the album’s finest track, the ethereal “Holocene,” Vernon muses, “Someway baby, it’s a part of me, apart from me ... And at once I knew I was not magnificent / Strayed above the highway aisle / I could see for miles,” over a lilting steel-string guitar. Vernon has a gift for abstract and poetic lyrics that generally touch upon themes of heartbreak, nostalgia, and coming to grips with adulthood. He most frequently employs language involving nature and the human figure, often switching quickly between the two, as in “Towers,” when he sings, “From the faun forever gone / In the towers of your honeycomb / I’d have tore your hair out just to climb back darling.” The abstruseness of his lyrics allows the listener to become lost in the sonic textures that Vernon and his band create.
Vernon remains an artist very much committed to the notion of a record as a cohesive piece of work, but at times “Bon Iver” is almost too unified. The songs bleed into each other with little or no transition, often picking up with the same melodic ideas as the previous track. To some extent, in a digital era in which many popular artists release albums with marketable singles sandwiched between filler, it’s refreshing to see a band that still values consistency across an album. On the other hand, while the band’s earlier work balanced introspective songwriting with memorable hooks, the tracks on “Bon Iver” are largely devoid of catchy melodies. Hardly any of the songs follow traditional verse-chorus structures; in fact, the album would much more accurately be described as a collection of soundscapes. The appropriately titled “Wash.” plays more like timid background music rather than a fully developed musical idea. The album might have been better served with a few more songs like first single “Calgary,” which starts as a somber ballad and goes on to erupt with driving guitars, pounding drums, and considerably more energy than the whole of the album’s middle portion.
As “Bon Iver” and its surrounding hype have clearly demonstrated, Justin Vernon is no longer a struggling folk singer camping out in the woods of Wisconsin. He has become a sought-after collaborator, critical darling, and college rock staple, and his latest proves he merits the attention. While it may not have any one song as memorable as “Skinny Love” or “Re: Stacks,” “Bon Iver” is nonetheless one of the year’s most impressive and moving records.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Beyoncé does something, she does it big. When Destiny’s Child first belted their way into the music world, they announced themselves with unstoppable hits like “No No No.” When she dropped her first solo album, “Dangerously in Love,” it debuted at number one on Billboard and sold over 4 million copies. She began her film career opposite Mike Myers in “Goldmember,” and then earned a Golden Globe nomination for her role in “Dreamgirls.”
But “4” is different. Though the Beyoncé singing on “4” is still the strong, independent woman of “I Am...Sasha Fierce,” many of her new songs focus on her wholly committed lifestyle, most recently confirmed by her pregnancy. On “1+1,” the first love song on an album filled with expressions of love and commitment, Beyoncé croons that “If I ain’t got nothin’ I got you,” a marked departure from “If you liked it then you should’ve put a ring on it.” Her crystal-clear high notes on the word “you” only emphasize the depth of her affection, and set the otherwise standard, solid ballad apart. “1+1” establishes the themes of romantic commitment and loving companionship that she dutifully follows throughout the album, which sometimes feels like one long love song.
On “The Best Thing I Never Had,” Beyoncé stops celebrating monogamy to deliver a triumphant breakup song. The song signals a break between the sentimentality of the first few songs and the idiosyncratic funk of the rest of the album. The song benefits from the use of backup vocalists to sing the chorus. At moments, Beyoncé’s strong soul voice disappears and is replaced with a sweet soprano chorus that reiterates that he was the “best thing [she] never had.” The effect makes her voice cut even more sharply through lyrics like “thank God you blew it,” and gives an angelic quality to the otherwise bitter theme.
The real fun begins about a third through the album, with the old-school jam “Party” featuring André 3000. This solidifies the change from Beyoncé’s standard style to an almost indie-retro turn. The funky beat and André 3000’s smooth talking hearken back to the days of boombox hip-hop, and, although she did not recruit any famous saxophone players like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry recently have, “Party” is clearly a tribute to the great musicians and styles of the past.
“Love on Top” also uses the signatures of old-school R&B and soul, but Beyoncé outdoes her predecessors with not one, but four voice-bending key changes. She holds her own through each shift and sells the song, but even her phenomenal voice can only carry a fairly repetitive tune for nearly 4 and a half minutes. “Love on Top” has a great brass section and a very talented chorus of back-up singers, but the song tries to keep the party going for just a little bit too long.
The album’s sonic diversity is only expanded by the almost military drumlines of “Countdown,” “End of Time,” and “Rule the World.” “End of Time” and “Rule the World” are both brawny, stripped-down anthems to girl power, each of which work well on their own, but become redundant when played in succession. “Countdown” is the most confusing song of the album—the vocals soar as if it were a love song while a brass band plays a funky march—but also the most compelling. It may not be especially aesthetically pleasing—the transitions between the hyperactive parts are slightly jarring—but it serves as a neat metaphor for the experimentation of the album—and her career—as a whole.
Beyoncé is in top form on “4.” Although it may not be perfect, the album captures the singer at a moment of artistic maturation. Beyoncé has clearly settled into her role as the queen of R&B, and seems to feel more free to experiment with both new and old styles. This transformation suits her.

“Someone’s giving French-kiss lessons / How else will we learn to love?” is one of the earliest lyrics on “Spazz,” a song from Stephen Malkmus & the Jicks’ new release “Mirror Traffic.” The lyric is characteristic of the album’s pervasive disaffected irony and its eye to absurdity. Stephen Malkmus is often associated with a ‘slacker’ aesthetic, and this album does its part to forward that image with both an understated emotional tone in its vocals and irony in its lyrics. Yet the album itself is inconsistent, and its overbearing, often self-deprecating irony is excessive. The sort of nascent urgency Malkmus’s vocals manage to conjure, while interesting, is also incongruous with the instrumentals, which too often subvert rather than support the lyrics.
The band has a sizeable following, especially among old Pavement fans, and this album certainly has qualities to recommend it. The songs are characterized by Malkmus’s drawling guitar. The dreamy and drawn-out intro to “Long Hard Book,” and the thoughtfully unadorned beginning to “Asking Price,” are especially exemplary of his skill. The few guitar solos on the album conjure a striking urgency. Despite these musical successes, the core of the songs is frequently obscured by seemingly hasty overdubs. This is particularly noticeable in some of Malkmus’ more energetic songs, such as “Forever 28,” and “All Over Gently.” On these tracks, the guitar riffs are overly distorted, and the vocals sound thin and tinny.
Overall, the pieces that do swim into focus are gripping—lines like “you want it / You got it / The lockjaw with animus on it,” and, of more dubious interest, “There’s a long hard book that needs reading,” with a long, legato ‘reading’. He’s known for his clever and vaguely satirical lyrics along the lines of “I know what the senator wants / What the senator wants is a blow job” from “Senator.” It takes several listens to suss out his meaning completely, because his voice tends to be rather amelodic and affectless. The uniformity of his emotional tone—or lack thereof—renders many of the songs indistinguishable, despite the often fascinating lyrical content. Though  he seems to hint at the album’s inscrutability on “Brain Gallop”—“Sometimes these words are such bitter ends / Come back to bite you in the rearest of ends”—The energy of his band lends an edge to some of the irony—while songs like “Long Hard Book” are laid back, “Tigers” and “Asking Price” have a bit of indignation in their irony; Malkmus seems almost sarcastic as he says “Too busy putzin’ round the internet / To revel in the disconnect.”
This biting irony, however, doesn’t quite pan out into a coherent conceptual intent. Occasionally, it seems that Malkmus has partly transcended his slacker aesthetic by using it as a way to mock hipsters—“I can’t even do one sit-up! / Sit-ups are so bourgeoise.” However, using a sort of bored irony to make fun of bored irony is a questionable accomplishment, since the approach does not seem to require much of an aesthetic shift. The emotional effect of irony satirizing itself is somewhat nihilistic, or at least defeatist and anhedonic. The more promising parts of the album are built off the tension he and his capable band occasionally strike. Malkmus seems to have something to say that’s a bit more urgent than usual, yet despite his infrequent and successful tonal shifts, he seems unable to break completely from the habits of his past work.

Unless you’re a comedy band like Spinal Tap, it takes guts to name an album “Suck It and See.” It takes serious bravado, or simply a desire to appear controversial, to display that title with no cover art to hide it. In its cocky abrasiveness, “Suck it and See” remains true to the Arctic Monkeys’ Yorkshire roots—a feat that is especially impressive given their transatlantic success. But while this album does not by any means play it safe, it doesn’t quite meet the expectations entertained by its brazen title. Devotees of the group’s sound will find much to praise in “Suck it and See,” except perhaps an adequate dose of daring.
On “Suck it and See,” lead singer and lyricist Alex Turner extends and overextends his famed wordplay. The effects are varied, including spectacular triumphs and laughable gaffes, often both in the same song. Take “The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala.” Though the first lyrics are strong, they soon stray into contrition. In the first verse, Turner delivers the wonderfully suggestive and sultry line, “Makes me wanna blow the candles out / Just to see if you glow in the dark,” but he follows it with the painful “Took the batteries out my mysticism / And put them in my thinking cap.” Thankfully, the lyrics are generally evocative, and together construct a series of dark,  intriguing images.
Darkness is a prevailing theme, which recurs in “Black Treacle,” a melancholy tale of an abuser of some unnamed substance. The effects of the narcotics on the unfortunate addict are reflected in the state of the night sky: “Somebody told the stars you’re not coming out tonight / And so they found a place to hide.” On this track and almost all the others, Turner takes his time, enunciating with sometimes startling precision that renders his thick accent clear as a bell. The intent is clear: the lyrics are meant to be savored. Gone are the Arctic Monkeys who sang rapidly of fluorescent adolescents, fishnets, and nightdresses. Heavy basslines, pounding drums, and guitar chords heavy with feedback all recall the band’s pre-“Humbug” bad-boy British rock sound, yet they’ve slowed down considerably. Though there is still something of the moody teenager on this album, Turner moves towards mid-tempos in an attempt to clarify the portraits of rambunctious youth he’s been crafting since the group’s very first release.
The album’s title track, “Suck it and See,” marks the group’s subtle departure from their typical testosterone-fuelled adolescent sound, producing a much-needed boost before the flaccid last track. The song starts out in the same vein as many of the other tracks on the album, going heavy on the loaded, creepy similes—“Your love is like a studded leather headlock”—but abandons lyrical flourish in favour of raw emotion and a sparer sound. The switch is refreshing and appropriate on the album’s penultimate track. Turner throws pontificating to the wind and belts, with little regard to meter, “You have got that face that just says, ‘Baby, I was meant to break your heart.’” It doesn’t sound hackneyed, but rather effectively candid.
However, the album too often neglects this sort of stylistic breakthrough in an attempt to cater to all tastes. “Library Pictures” sounds like a warmed-over track from “Favourite Worst Nightmare,” plodding along lifelessly for two minutes and 22 seconds. “That’s Where You’re Wrong” falls as flat as its title, and is a disappointment in its role as album closer.
On the whole, however, “Suck it and See” does best when it challenges the old formula. It is sure to please old fans on some of its more traditional tracks, too, though these seem perhaps less exciting than they once did. For all the title’s promise of scandalous swagger, it’s a surprisingly tame—albeit successful—attempt to stoke the fires of hype that have propelled their career. But the flashes of brilliance, coupled with more than enough of their tried-and-true musical instincts, redeem the album’s more cautious aspects.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week the Class of 2015 was asked by College administration to sign a pledge promising to act with integrity, respect, and industry during their time at Harvard. The pledge has drawn diverse reactions from leaders in our community. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis called the pledge “very unscholarly” and “very unlike Harvard.”  Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 defended the pledge as a means of disseminating Harvard’s overarching values. However, the Freshman Pledge should be controversial only because of its moderate scope; it is only the beginning of the moral education Harvard should impart on undergraduates.
In a spring 2011 freshman survey, members of the Class of 2014 ranked success as the value Harvard most stands for. They ranked compassion as one of the values it least stands for, among the options provided, although they ranked it high among the values they personally stood for. This is more than “unfortunate,” as The Crimson was told; it is completely unacceptable.
The misalignment between students’ values and those they perceive this institution as having is worrisome. It stands that we joined this community to become better versions of ourselves. However, the survey conveyed that the Class of 2014 does not believe Harvard prioritizes the same type of self-improvement they do.
This seems one more piece of evidence that the College needs to provide a stronger moral education. While is true that students hear of promoting understanding and serving society, at Commencement, both this instance and the pledge, are momentary messages. The fact is that students receive more reminders to turn in their study cards than they do to be nice.
This education should encompass, at the least, a forceful honor code, that is referenced frequently and specifically in classes and in the Houses. The honor code should encompass much more than a simple commitment to academic honesty—it should instead offer a wider moral vision like those at certain peer institutions like Princeton, which encourages integrity among undergraduates in all spheres of student life. Moreover, Harvard would have significant advantage in creating an honor code today; it would be able to learn from the mistakes of its peer institutions and create a more modern system of academic and community regulations in light of the Internet and other new technologies.
Advocating for an overarching honor code is not at all a new idea. Harvard University and Harvard College have believed in the idea of a moral education for years. On June 10, 1962, for instance, President Nathan M. Pusey explained his conception of a “moral education” as “Harvard’s hope that there will develop here generation after generation—now as in the past—of thoughtful men who through their beliefs and actions will go on to renew and strengthen true quality in the world’s life.” In fact, the view of a moral education has been in American national discourse throughout recent decades, and Harvard would be well within its means to codify a set of moral values for its students beyond the overly simple encouragement of “kindness,” which could mean many things.
In order to ensure that our college and university is a “place where all can thrive,” the student body needs an explicit affirmation of the moral value set that should guide the Harvard community, if it is to be a happy and fulfilling place to spend one’s formative years. As long as the signing of the freshman pledge remains voluntary, there is no good reason why the student body and the administration cannot embark together upon a bolder course of action with respect to the codification of morality at Harvard.  An honor system to be presented at the beginning of one’s Harvard career, and impressed at many intervals until graduation, would strengthen and better define community values. It would curb academic dishonesty. And it would truly bring integrity, respect, compassion, and kindness on par with success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, hundreds of Harvard’s dining hall workers, security guards, and custodians marched through Harvard Yard demanding “sustainable jobs.”
All three of these groups of workers are negotiating union contracts with the University this fall. In their contract negotiations with the University, workers have asked for more than wage raises or better benefits. Instead, Harvard’s employees have asked that the University embrace a new movement that defines “sustainability” not only in terms of the environment, but in terms of jobs.
Despite contractual wage increases, the average Harvard dining hall worker lost $900 in wages, between the past academic year and the one before, due to working fewer hours, according to the Student Labor Action Movement. These losses significantly affect workers already straining to afford food and rent, at rising prices.
Most dining hall workers are laid off during the summer and during J-term, and struggle to find summer jobs. However, many hour cuts have taken place during the school year itself, leaving dining hall workers with less than full-time work at Harvard. They must find second jobs or depend on other income just to pay their rent or raise their kids. Their jobs at Harvard are not sustainable ways of living.
Moreover, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services cuts these hours by employing practices which are environmentally unsustainable. Dining hall workers report that the University purchases an increasing amount of packaged and pre-prepared food, which is cut, baked, or cooked off-site and shipped to Harvard pre-made.
Not only does this necessitate the environmentally unfriendly costs of packaging and transportation, it also reduces the amount of work that Harvard’s dining hall workers must do to prepare food, which separates them from the food production process and reduces the number of hours they can work.
So, as they explained in a leaflet handed to incoming freshmen on move-in day this fall, entitled “Sustainable Food and Sustainable Jobs,” participating workers are asking that tasks like cutting vegetables and baking bread be brought back in-house to increase workers’ hours and make the dining hall food as sustainable—and fresh and tasteful—as it used to be.
The relationship between the labor movement and the green movement has been rocky at times in the past. For example, in the interest of job creation, the Teamsters union supported President Bush’s plan to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 2004. Similarly, the United Auto Workers has opposed proposals to raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for cars, fearing that increased production prices will lead to job losses.
This tension stems in part from the perception of the green movement as privileged, elitist, and removed from the realities of working class life. Today, though, coalitions like the BlueGreen Alliance advocate for “green jobs,” and organizations such as Labor Network for Sustainability seek to inspire those in the labor movement about environmental issues.
At the same time, sustainability activist groups, especially those which focus on students, have begun revising the traditional definition of “sustainability” to incorporate workers’ rights.  For example, Real Food Challenge, a student movement to redefine “real” food as food which “nourishes producers, consumers, communities, and the earth,” includes the wellbeing of both farm workers and food service workers as part of its definition of real food. Harvard’s Food Literacy Project and HUHDS both plan to sponsor events for Food Day, which presses for sustainable and humane food to “support fair conditions for food and farm workers.”
Harvard’s workers are currently engaged in one of the first campaigns to unite the environmental movement and the labor movement on college campuses. Now, workers who want to prepare and serve high-quality food serve as the strongest advocates for greener dining halls. Environmentalists who view fair work practices as a component of sustainability now support workers in their campaign for full-time work. And student activists (like me) who care both about the environment and labor rights can form large coalitions that press for true systemic change in the food system.
So when you see posters, buttons, or leaflets around campus calling for “sustainable jobs,” don’t just think about organic food. Think about Harvard’s dining hall workers, security guards, and custodians. Think about full-time jobs. Think about the environmental movement and the labor movement working together at last. And think about how Harvard’s workers are redefining sustainability in a campaign that brings together students, workers, and activists in one unified fight.

Last week, Harvard freshmen adopted for the first time a pledge to act with “integrity, respect, and industry, and to sustain a community characterized by inclusiveness and civility.” This year’s freshman class was asked to use the Dean’s traditional commencement message to our graduates (“to advance knowledge, to promote understanding, and to serve society”) as a kind of moral compass for their Harvard education, thus opening their experience the way we have historically closed it.
In recent days, the pledge has generated a bit of controversy, with some suggesting that a pledge of any kind subverts intellectual freedom and is contrary to Harvard tradition. Others have argued that the public display of a framed pledge with student signatures might pressure students to act against their own wishes. In particular, some have questioned why Harvard is in the business of promoting kindness, which the current version of the pledge asserts should hold “a place on par with intellectual attainment.”
These discussions about the new Freshman pledge have come to be configured as a debate between intellectual freedom and the pursuit of truth on the one hand, and civility and empathy on the other. But we think this is a false dichotomy. The pursuit of knowledge is enhanced, not hindered, by a commitment to live respectfully and to understand the perspectives of others.
Indeed, this ability to assume the perspective of other people—empathy—is thought to be a key feature of academic and professional success. Psychologists relatedly speak of a “theory of mind”: the ability to recognize that one’s observations, beliefs and desires are distinct from those of other people. A person who bombastically hijacks a class discussion or rips down a sign in support of a group with which he or she disagrees could be said to be unaware of the experiences and feelings of others.
A healthy university should absolutely be unafraid to engage in the rough and tumble of intellectual discourse, about any topic whatsoever. We don’t expect to treat people with kid gloves. But we shouldn’t allow our commitment to intellectual integrity as an abstraction to undermine our commitment to intellectual integrity in reality. While some invoke inapt metaphors of “group think” and “mind control” in the setting of discussing the meaning and utility of a freshman pledge, we would argue that a civil society is synonymous with an open society. In our experience as House Masters and educators, it is very hard for students to engage in learning in an atmosphere of disrespect.
But to be clear: This is not a simple matter of hurt feelings; 21st century learning requires levels of communication, collaboration, and cross-disciplinary creativity that were not conceived of even a decade ago. If we intend our graduates to serve and advance society, surely we can ask them to put their own interests in a broader context while at Harvard College.
This year at Pforzheimer House, we have invited the incoming class of 2014 to help us generate their vision of an open society. We are collecting words and phrases that capture the community to which they aspire. We are not deluded in thinking that this simple activity will magically transform our community or magically improve every individual’s behavior. But the notion of building a community centered on, and committed to, truth is a singular task, one that people have struggled with since we began to organize ourselves into societies. The purpose of the freshmen pledge, and the conversations it was meant to stimulate among freshman, was to help in this age-old task. We think we should have more, not fewer, discussions about how to create a more civil society.
We can have legitimate discussion about how best to implement the freshman pledge. Indeed, the present circumstances present a good opportunity to model how such discussions might optimally take place. New initiatives often have to be retooled after a trial run. But we stand absolutely firm in our commitment to encourage students—indeed, to expect students—to approach their Harvard careers with an open, thoughtful, and generous mind. Too often, our students can forget, in the business of their own lives, that their individual search for truth depends on the generosity and hard work of other people: fellow students, families, professors, administrators, tutors and proctors, coaches, dining hall and custodial staff, the list goes on—even to include the generations of previous scholars and countless prior supporters of our institution.
We live in an increasingly interconnected world and depend on one another. A freshman pledge can assert this simple truth, asking students to embrace it. Our strength as a university depends on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was very disappointed to read The Crimson’s recent editorial on Marc D. Hauser. Not satisfied to have helped run Professor Hauser out of academia, The Crimson complains that the university failed to heed its call last spring to fire Hauser, thus allowing him the face-saving gesture of resigning.
The Crimson, usually such an ardent champion of those whose rights have been trampled, is on the wrong side of this issue. Harvard has not made clear what Hauser is actually accused of doing, much less the evidence underlying the conclusion that misconduct occurred. In fact, the tide of information slowly trickling out is swinging in the opposite direction, calling into question just how serious Hauser’s infractions really were. I agree with The Crimson that the Harvard administration has badly handled this case; its silence has let The Crimson and many others jump to conclusions that cannot be justified on the basis of what is known. Rather than hopping on this bandwagon, The Crimson should have been standing up for due process and counseling patience. Both fairness and prudence should have dictated a “let’s wait until the facts are known” stance.
The basis for The Crimson’s position is that a secret Harvard investigation concluded that Hauser engaged in some undefined misconduct. Many, The Crimson included, assumed the worst, but the available information does not justify such conclusions. Here’s what we know: Four years ago, lab members contacted the University, alleging that Hauser had ignored colleagues who disagreed with his scoring of experimental data; when they on their own reviewed tapes of the monkey trials, they concluded that Hauser’s scoring was wrong, and that publications based on his scorings were thus faulty. They claimed that Hauser refused to consider their concerns and pushed forward with publishing the data. After a three-year review, Harvard’s investigative panel concluded that Hauser had engaged in scientific misconduct on eight projects, three of which were published in the scientific literature. Subsequently, a research assistant leaked an affidavit to the press; Harvard then took the unusual step of confirming that an investigation had taken place and that Hauser had been found to have engaged in misconduct, but refused to provide any further details because a federal review is now ongoing. Whether compelled by the University or advised by his attorneys, Hauser has not commented either on the investigation or on the speculations in the press.
So, what do we know about this misconduct? A wide variety of actions qualify as “misconduct” and some are more serious than others. I’ll start with the three published papers. In the first, which appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Hauser and a colleague last year published a “correction” in the same journal because “It has been discovered that the video records and field notes are incomplete for two of the conditions.” As a result, they returned to the field site, re-did the experiment, and confirmed their previous findings. Certainly, one cannot condone the loss of crucial data records underlying a paper, but it is important to recognize that the results reported initially appear to be correct. This example would not seem to be a grievous form of misconduct.
The second paper was published in Science. In April, that journal issued an announcement that original data for this study, too, had been lost, but that Hauser and colleagues had re-run the experiment and the results were found—after extremely careful review by the journal (much greater than that to which most papers are subjected)—to completely corroborate the initial study. In other words, this sounds very similar to the previous case: poor record-keeping, not something more serious that resulted in the publication of incorrect results.
The third paper, published in the journal Cognition, was retracted, which means that the results reported in the paper are in some way faulty. Without more information, we cannot know what happened. The lab members complained that Hauser ignored them when they informed him of doubts about the data scoring, and apparently the investigative committee agreed and considered this misconduct. But misconduct of what sort? Did Hauser just make up the data or knowingly publish incorrect results, as many seem to believe? Or is there some more mundane—if not condonable—explanation, such as that he trusted his own observations more than his associates, that he was too lazy to go back and re-examine the tapes, or too stubborn to consider that he might have made a mistake? Or maybe he has a perfectly plausible explanation which failed to convince the investigating committee. Personally, I’d like to hear the full story before accepting the absolute worst case scenario.
Lastly, Hauser was found to have engaged in misconduct in five other projects which were either never published or in which the problems were corrected prior to publication. As a scientist myself, I have to wonder what kind of misconduct that might have involved. It’s one thing to accuse somebody of publishing a paper based on made up data or knowingly incorrect analyses, but irregularities in the research project that do not lead to publication are a potentially less serious matter.  Perhaps, in fact, the problems were recognized by Hauser, and that’s why the projects weren’t published or were corrected before publication. Of course, I can think of very serious types of misconduct that occur even in the absence of publication of a paper, but I can also think of many much less serious breaches. In the absence of more information on these projects, I have trouble assuming that these are terrible offenses, given that no paper including incorrect results was published.
Finally, I’m bemused that The Crimson has so much faith in Harvard’s secret investigative committees, given its usual skepticism of University procedures and motives. University investigations are not legal proceedings, and the standards of evidence and fairness are not the same as in a courtroom. Moreover, the University’s objectives are not just to treat the accused fairly, but also to protect the accuser and the university’s interests. Many believe that these conflicting goals lead the accused individual to be treated unfairly, and there are some famous examples of such investigations being overturned upon further review.
So, what’s the bottom line? Does the information publically available support The Crimson’s position that Hauser should have been fired last spring? To me, the answer is a resounding “no.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bonds from Harvard University, MIT, and Princeton University were the best performers among US investment-grade bonds in the month of August.
These institutions, whose bonds traded for more than 120 cents on the dollar, saw at least a 9 percent rise in value during August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. MIT’s 100 year bonds made the greatest gains, rising from 104 cents in July to  121.9 cents on the dollar on Aug. 26.
Some attribute this rise—which follows Standard & Poor’s downgrade of US Treasury bonds from AAA to AA+ in early August—to the financial stability of major universities, such as Harvard, which have maintained a AAA rating from both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service.
By comparison, the U.S. Treasuries gained only 2.8 percent in August.
“Risk aversion, a flight to quality and also with S&P downgrading Treasuries to AA+, I think it’s enhanced the bid for AAA securities because there aren’t that many left,” James Lee, a senior analyst at Calvert Investments, told Bloomberg News.
Harvard’s 6.5 percent bonds maturing this year rose 9.8 percent to 136.4 cents on the dollar, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
University President Drew G. Faust has said that Harvard would ween itself off of borrowing, a method it had in recent years used to finance new building construction.
During the 2008 financial crisis, Harvard sold $2.5 billion in bonds, and issued debt as recently as November 2010, when the University sold $601 million in bonds.
In June, Harvard bought back $300 million of the 2008 bonds, hoping a smaller debt load would allow the University more flexibility to make new investments, according to Bloomberg.

Rep. Michael E. Capuano has decided not to run for a seat in the Senate.
“After serious personal reflection, I have decided not to seek the United States Senate seat for Massachusetts at this time,” Capuano wrote in a statement released Friday. “There are several good candidates currently in the race and I am fully satisfied that any nominee from this group will represent Massachusetts effectively in the Senate.”
Capuano, a Democrat, represents the 8th Congressional district that includes Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, and Chelsea.
He previously ran for the Senate seat currently held by Republican Scott P. Brown, but was unsuccessful in winning the Democratic nomination in the January 2010 special election after the death of the late Senator Ted Kennedy ’54-’56.
Brown defeated Attorney General Martha Coakley, a surprising upset in a traditionally blue state.
Brown’s inauguration broke the Democratic supermajority in the Senate, and was followed by a wave of Republicans elected to Congress in the mid-term election last November.
Harvard Law School professor and former Obama Administration advisor Elizabeth Warren has hinted over the past weeks that she plans to run against Brown in the upcoming election. Warren, who has spent the past year beefing up consumer protection regulations, has garnered respect from her Democrat peers in Washington, many of whom are now urging her to run.
Some analysts say that the excitement surrounding Warren has drawn the spotlight away from other possible candidates.
“She is sucking all of the oxygen out of the race,” said Mass. Democratic Strategist Scott Ferson. “No one else has figured out how to be even mentioned. She has momentum because she is legitimately an exciting candidate.”
Capuano said that he intends to run for re-election in the House.
“Thanks to everyone who has encouraged me to seek the Senate seat,” he wrote. “I very much appreciate your support and your insight. I look forward to seeking re-election to the House in 2012.”
Alison Mills, Capuano’s press secretary, could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the newspaper industry in a state of flux, a time when the editors of The New York Times were scratching their heads over how to build a sustainable financial model for a 21st century newspaper, then-Managing Editor for News Jill E. Abramson ’76 hit the pause button on her daily duties and embarked on a six month sabbatical known as “Jill’s Big Adventure.”
During that time, Abramson immersed herself in the paper’s digital operations and toured the newsrooms of innovative online publications like The Huffington Post and Politico, an effort that in hindsight seems geared toward digitally grooming the future executive editor of the Times.
Today, Abramson takes over from Bill Keller as the executive editor of the nation’s arguably most prestigious daily newspaper.
But Abramson’s path to the top of the Gray Lady’s masthead has been anything but smooth, beginning at Harvard College and snaking through a series of American publications.
According to her friends and media reports, Abramson is a gritty, fearless editor unafraid of taking on daunting challenges while at the same time rising above one of the paper’s darker chapters in recent years.
Now, the Times—like nearly every other newspaper—must make hard decisions about how to position itself to ensure its survival, a challenge that has many worrying about the future of journalism.
But in Abramson the Times now has an executive editor who has overcome her own share of challenges—as a woman navigating the male dominated culture of American newsrooms, recovering after being hit by a truck outside Times headquarters, and moving beyond the Times often criticized coverage of the run-up to the Iraq war, which as Washington bureau chief Abramson oversaw.
Abramson began her career at Harvard just a year after the University implemented a co-ed living system. Abramson’s degree bears the name of Harvard-Radcliffe, and during her time in Cambridge the gender segregation of the previous era lingered.
Now, Abramson is the first woman to hold the position of executive editor at The Times.
A New York native, Abramson’s time at Harvard passed in the fashion typical of most students. She tried her hand on stage to mediocre reviews, wrote her History and Literature thesis on the unemployed in Britain during the Great Depression, and edited the Radcliffe Union of Students newsletter. She also met her future husband, Henry Little Griggs III ’76, at the College.
But Abramson’s path through journalism eschewed the traditional path of many professional journalists who have attended the College. During her college years she wrote as a stringer for Time Magazine. Then, in 1976, she covered that year’s presidential race for the magazine.
“I remember being in the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer the night of the New Hampshire primary, so proud of the press credential dangling from my neck. I gazed at all the famous ‘boys on the bus,’ including Jack Germond and Hunter Thompson. But as a very young woman, I didn’t dare belly up to the bar. Those days are over,” she told the Times in 2010.
Shortly after graduating, Abramson was recruited to work at a start-up magazine, the American Lawyer.
But because the industry had previously received little coverage, lawyers were hesitant to talk to any reporter—regardless of age or gender.
American Lawyer, where tight-lipped sources were the norm, gave Abramson and her colleagues invaluable training as reporters.
Ellen Pollack, a good friend of Abramson who also worked at the paper, remembers her as a dogged reporter with a knack for getting the story.
“Her instincts on a story are amazing,” Pollack said. “It’s like she has a magical radar. It’s experience but also intuition and smarts.”
Steven J. Brill, the founder of American Lawyer, echoed that praise.
“She was eager,” Brill said. “She really shined quickly and progressed very rapidly where all the reporting was hard.”
But maybe more importantly, as a cub reporter at the paper, she was more than willing to put in long hours.
“A lot of people would do a story and make a few phone calls—we would have to make 100 phone calls and do a story,” Pollack said. “But we were also having a huge amount of fun. We had a little tiny space at Esquire magazine and we were all huddled together. It was like we are all dorm mates working on these stories. We were practically sitting on each other’s laps, and we all came into work on Sundays.”
So when Abramson relocated to Washington D.C. because of her husband’s job, Brill says her decision to move was a driving factor behind his decision to start a D.C. branch of American Lawyer.
When it was announced in June, Abramson’s appointment as the Times’ executive editor was not seen as a surprise by most observers. Pollack claims she knew long ago that Abramson would eventually take over.
“I always knew she was going to get this job,” Pollack said. “I told her 13 years ago that she was going to run the Times.”
In a newsroom where many of its reporters and editors have spent the entirety of their careers, Abramson is an exception. She also has not worked as a foreign correspondent for the paper, a position that many see as a required credential for the paper’s top editor.
But as a New Yorker, Abramson grew up in a family that she says worshipped the paper.
“In my house growing up, the Times substituted for religion,” she said in the Times article that accompanied the announcement that she would succeed Keller. “If the Times said it, it was the absolute truth.”
But it was at Times rival The Wall Street Journal that Abramson established herself as a top-tier reporter, working as one of the Journal’s White House correspondents.
Eventually, however, the opportunity to work at her first journalistic love presented itself. Despite reportedly being offered more money to stay, Abramson left the Journal much to the disappointment of then-Managing Editor Paul Steiger.
“Jill’s [departure] was one of the very few, one of the only I can think of, that 6 months after she left I could feel her loss in our coverage,” Stieger said. “In most cases when a star left, the system kind of reacted and someone came along, stuck to the job, developed it and we didn’t miss a beat. Jill’s departure was felt, I felt, for quite some time afterwards.”
After leaving the Journal, Abramson ascended to the position of Washington bureau chief, overseeing a controversial period in the Times’ editorial history.
Abramson ran the paper’s Washington bureau from 2001 to 2003, a period that included the run-up to the Iraq war. During that time, the Times ran a series of stories, many authored by reporter Judith Miller, that supported the Bush administration’s contention that Iraq had pursued the development of weapons of mass destruction. That turned out to be false, and many of the stories that backed the White House’s line on WMDs came out of Abramson’s Washington bureau.
Abramson has not ducked responsibility for its coverage during that time. In a review of four books by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward about the Bush administration, Abramson stepped back and admitted that she should have done more to push back against the Bush White House’s claims about Saddam Hussein’s pursuit of WMDs.
New York Times staff writer James Risen and Woodward had independently produced similar stories that cast doubt on Bush administration intelligence reports regarding Iraqi WMDs, but Abramson says she was not a sufficiently strong advocate for the story.
“I was Washington bureau chief for The Times while this was happening, and I failed to push hard enough for an almost identical, skeptical article, written by James Risen,” she wrote in September of 2008. “This was a period when there were too many credulous accounts of the administration’s claims about Iraq’s WMDs (including some published in The Times and The Post).”
In 2004, the Times published an extensive editor’s note describing how it had failed in its coverage during the lead up to the invasion of Iraq, but despite overseeing much of that coverage Abramson has continued to rise through the paper’s ranks.
Now, Abramson faces the challenge of fully implementing the paper’s digital strategy. The Times recently put in place a metered pay wall that gives readers access to 20 articles per month before requiring purchase of a paid subscription.
The system has been criticized for being easy to bypass, but early reports suggest that the Times may have found a model to generate significant revenue from its digital operations. Since launching in March, the paper has garnered 224,000 digital subscribers while at the same time maintaining a healthy 33 million unique visitors per month, which was in line with its pre-paywall volume.
In the second quarter of this year, the Times logged an operating loss of $114.1 million, but excluding the write down of a significant chunk of debt, the paper made a profit of about 14 cents per share, according to Forbes.
These results are encouraging for a paper that has gone through newsroom buyouts and layoffs but by no means implies that the paper has reached sound financial footing.
Additionally, the paper still has to transition fully from its print-centric heritage to a model that places the web at the forefront of its wide range of content. But preliminary signs indicate that Abramson may be the woman for the job.
Jen Preston, a social media repoter at the Times, tweeted, “For all of you wondering about Jill Abramson and the Web? Jill gets it. And she’s fearless. We’re lucky.”
Her editor from the American Lawyer agrees.
Brill said, “She is singularly equipped among the leading editors in the country to take the New York Times from the preeminent organization that chops down trees and delivers the news to your doorstep, to the leader that delivers the best news in whatever way you want it.”

CORRECTION: SEP. 6, 2011
The Sep. 6 article "Jill Abramson Takes Top Post at New York Times" misidentified Jen Preston's position at the paper. She is currently a social media reporter and not the social media editor, though she formerly worked in the latter role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost one in three students from the Class of 2011 working for pay this year will take jobs in the financial services or consulting sectors, according to Senior Surveys conducted by the Office of Career Services last spring.
It’s a statistic that embodies the extent to which Harvard students gravitate towards high-profile and high-paying jobs.
Now a group of entrepreneurs are looking to give students another option.
Drawing lessons from the successful Teach for America program that sends college graduates into classrooms across the country, the new program—Venture for America—will connect graduates with start-up companies.
The program, whose board includes a number of Harvard alumni and professors, will give 50 hopeful entrepreneurs two-year jobs at 50 separate start-ups beginning next summer.
The arrangement is “win-win-win,” said VFA’s founder Andrew Yang. College graduates will gain coveted entrepreneurial experience, while start-ups without the recruiting resources of larger companies will be able to entice the country’s best and brightest, he said. And by sending students to start-ups in three “low-cost” cities—Detroit, New Orleans, and Providence—program organizers also hope to foster community development.
“We think that there are hundreds of seniors who very badly want to learn how to start a business, but those ambitions are difficult to fulfill on your own,” Yang said.
The program is gaining momentum. Although its formal recruiting process has not begun, more than 400 students from schools across the country have submitted applications.
Yang hopes VFA will become a “runway” for students interested in entrepreneurship. Following a three-round application process that includes a written application, phone interview, and trip to New York, each selected “fellow” will receive five weeks of training at Brown University.
Participants will be matched with 1 of 50 partner start-ups and will receive normal employment benefits and an annual salary of approximately $35,000.
Gaibrielle A. Bryant ’12, a Detroit native who has already applied to VFA, said the program is more than an internship.
“This is a job that you have for two years,” she said.
And for one talented fellow per class, there is an extra reward at the end of the program: $100,000 in feed investment to start his or her own business.
Jinzhao Wang ’14, co-president of the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum, said this incentive is an important aspect of what makes VFA innovative.
“VFA will give people the satisfactory feeling that they are doing something good—but they are making this opportunity just as economically satisfying as other opportunities,” she said.
HCEF is coordinating with VFA to organize a recruitment event on campus early in the fall.
Chris S. Paik ’09, a member of VFA’s Board, said he thinks VFA’s message is a particularly important one for the Harvard community, which is generally very “risk-averse.”
Calling the financial services “prestigious, well paying, safe,” and “logical,” he acknowledged that starting a business means accepting a high rate of failure—an idea that Harvard students may have trouble taking to heart, he said.
He said students mistakenly see enterpreneurship as only high-risk, high-reward. “If you get it right, you’re Mark Zuckerberg, and if you get it wrong, you live in your parents’ garage for the rest of your life,” he said about students' perceptions.
But Paik hopes that VFA can gain the prestige of TFA—and start to eliminate the stigma of risk Harvard students associate with entrepreneurship.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
Clarification: An earlier version of the Sept. 6 news article "New Program Leads Grads to Start-Ups" incorrectly implied that a quote from Chris S. Paik '09 reflected his beiefs rather than students' misperceptions.

Adams House Master and Harvard Medical School Professor of Pediatrics Judith S. “Judy” Palfrey ’67 has been named Executive Director of Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” Initiative, the White House announced on Friday.
Palfrey will take a leave from Harvard for up to two years to run the First Lady’s pet project, which is dedicated to combatting the growing American childhood obesity epidemic.
Palfrey left for Washington on Monday afternoon, but her husband, John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, will stay in Cambridge and continue to serve as House Master.
Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell will assume the role of interim House Master in addition to her regular duties.
Judith Palfrey, who has long been a part of the Let’s Move Initiative and spoke at its inaugural event in 2010, said her experience with Harvard House life has prepared her for the challenges she might face in Washington.
“Living in a community like Harvard and like the Houses, you really learn how communities work together, how people share responsibility, how teams form,” Palfrey said. “That’s what this is all about really—rebuilding communities all over the United States.”
Although she will spend her weeks in Washington, she will return to Cambridge on the weekends and continue to be a part of Adams House, where she has been a House Master for 12 years.
But, she said, she is ready to take on the fight against childhood obesity.
“It’s a difficult problem,” Palfrey said. “It won’t be easy, but I’m honored to have this opportunity and excited to get started.”
A healthy lifestyle has long been a professional and personal priority for Palfrey, said her son, John G. Palfrey Jr. ’94, who is also a professor at Harvard Law School.
“Sports were always a central element of our life together as a family,” her son said. “Part of her vision of what a healthy society looks like is one where diet habits and exercise are part of family life.”
Previously, Judith Palfrey served as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics as a Senior Associate in Medicine at the Children’s Hospital Boston.
“Her tremendous experience and insight in pediatrics and community health will make her a strong leader for Let’s Move! and make a real difference in the lives of our nation’s children,” First Lady Michelle Obama said in a White House press release.
Palfrey joins a growing list of Harvard professors who have left academia to join the Obama administration, including Harvard Law School Professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75 and Harvard Kennedy School Professor Samantha Power.

Harvard Business School released the first set of admissions decisions Sept. 1 for the 2+2 Class of 2016, an early acceptance program for college seniors who are expected to work for two years before matriculating at the Business School.
This is the first year HBS has extended the 2+2 application process beyond the summer, offering three further application rounds later this academic year.
The Business School will not release a statistical break-down of admissions information until the application cycle ends this spring.
“Speculating on how many offers we will make or on what kinds of profiles or applicants will be successful based on what has happened so far would be a mistake,” said Deirdre C. Leopold, managing director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid.
Among this year’s accepted students is Adams House senior Elizabeth C. Ahern ’12, who applied to the 2+2 program during the summer admissions round.
Ahern, who currently serves as the co-president of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business, said she feels very lucky to have been granted the opportunity to attend HBS.
“I love the case study method at HBS,” she said of her reasons for applying to the Business School. “You’re constantly thinking like a leader and making the same tough decisions in the classroom that business people make.”
Though she has not decided where to work after graduation, Ahern said she is interested in returning to Paul Mitchell—a professional hair products manufacturer—where she spent her summer after freshman year interning in the marketing and advertising department.
Last year, 828 people applied for admission to the 2+2 Class of 2015 and 100 were accepted, resulting in an acceptance rate of 12 percent. The number of applicants rose from 630 in 2008, when 106 students were accepted to the program.
“The most important part of the application is taking the time to be self-reflective and convey your personality through your essays,” Ahern said of the admissions process. “They really dig deep into your story. They want to hear more about who you are and during the interview they want to simulate what you’ll experience in the classroom with the on-the-spot questions they ask.”
For seniors still interested in applying to the 2+2 Program, Leopold said members of the Business School will be hosting events at the College over the course of the year to talk to students about the program.
“We plan to do a number of information sessions at Harvard College this fall to help seniors decide whether they would like to apply,” she said.

Harvard has expanded the resources for the Dumbarton Oaks research library with the purchase of a property in Washington, D.C., that will eventually house the institute’s research fellows.
The new building, located at 1700 Wisconsin Avenue, was purchased in May for $7 million.
The property will provide the fellows with a much-needed residence, according to Dumbarton Oaks director Jan M. Ziolkowski. The proximity of the new building will allow fellows to “take full advantage of access to collections and colleagues at the institute,” he said.
Dumbarton Oaks is a satellite library and research institution housed in an historic building in the Georgetown neighborhood of D.C. It runs several fellowship programs devoted to its area of focus on Byzantine studies, Pre-Columbian studies, and garden and landscape studies.
As with the finances of other Harvard institutions, Dumbarton Oaks’s endowments are managed as dedicated funds within the overall endowment, according to a University spokesman.
The institution’s endowment income has outpaced its expenditures in recent years, and the resulting reserves will be used to fund capital projects, including the purchase of the building.
According to a University spokesman, Dumbarton Oaks has been looking for an opportunity to expand for several years, and the current real estate market made this an auspicious time to buy.
Ziolkowski said in a statement that the building will be remodeled to reflect its new role as a residential complex.
Proposed renovations to the building will include window replacements, new heating and cooling systems, 25 residential units for the fellows, and the addition of a fourth floor and a side annex, according to GeorgetownPatch.
The property may also receive some more modern touches, such as the creation of vertical garden on one side of the building, and a glass window running up the center of the building.
The property is currently inhabited by the Cameroon Embassy, which leases the building from the current owners of the property.
Dumbarton Oaks plans to renovate the space after the Cameroon Embassy vacates following the end of its lease in January.
The Cameroon Embassy did not return requests for comment.
Though the property does fall within an official landmark district, the renovations will not have to follow the D.C. Historic Preservation Office’s guidelines. Instead, the renovations must be approved by the Old Georgetown Board before they are executed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A change of plea hearing has been set for Sept. 30 in the case of Brittany J. Smith—the former Harvard student charged as an accessory in the May 2009 killing of a Cambridge drug dealer.
Smith appeared in court today for the continuation of sentencing negotiations with the prosecution, as she may choose to plead guilty and not stand trial.
“We expect the case to be resolved at that time [Sept. 30] or a trial date to be set,” said Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85, a prosecutor on the case. Bennett could not confirm whether the sentence was the issue of contention holding up the case.
Smith’s attorney John P. Osler did not immediately return a request for comment.
It has been reported that Smith and her attorneys are currently in the midst of plea negotiations with prosecutors, but it is unclear what progress has been made during those talks and what type of sentence Smith might face if she agrees to a deal.
Today’s decision to schedule another hearing at the end of September gives Smith another three weeks to make a decision over whether to accept a deal.
Smith was just two weeks away from graduating when, on May 18, 2009, her boyfriend Jabrai Jordan Copney and two accomplices shot and killed Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland’s J entryway.
Copney, an aspiring songwriter from New York City, was found guilty of felony murder of the first degree at the conclusion of his trial in April. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
His accomplices Blayn Jiggetts and Jason F. Aquino pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter prior to the start of Copney’s trial in exchange for cooperating with the prosecution. Aquino was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set for Jiggetts.
A senior in Lowell House at the time, Smith allegedly saw Jiggetts load the gun in her room before the shooting. Prosecutors say she then gave Copney her Harvard ID to gain access to Kirkland, where he was to meet with Cosby as part of a “drug rip.” Cosby was shot in the entryway and died from the bullet wound to his abdomen.
Upon Copney’s return from the scene of the shooting in Kirkland, Smith allegedly hid the gun in her blockmate’s room. She then called a taxi to help with the defendants’ getaway to South Station, where the four boarded a bus to New York. Smith returned to Harvard the next day.
Smith entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the district attorney’s office in July 2009, but prosecutors say she broke the terms of the agreement by lying to investigators and misleading a grand jury.
Smith’s attorney filed a motion to dismiss the violation, but that motion was denied by Superior Court Justice Diane M. Kottmyer in June. The prosecution has since continued to pursue Smith’s case.
Smith, a native of Harlem, is the only Harvard student to be charged for any involvement with the murder. She, along with Chanequa N. Campbell, a senior in Kirkland House at the time who was also implicated in the murder but never charged, did not receive Harvard diplomas. Campbell also signed a non-prosecution agreement in exchange for her cooperation with the investigation.
Smith’s father and many members of her family were present in the courtroom, as well as Denise Cosby, the victim’s mother.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social spaces across campus—from the Cabot Cafe in the Quad to the Eliot Grille on the river—will undergo renovations this year, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced on Tuesday.
The College has also tapped the Quad Grille in Pforzheimer House and the first floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles as other venues that will be updated in the coming year. In addition, Hammonds announced the creation of a new multimedia lab in Mather House, where students will have access to media production equipment, among other technologies.
Hammonds said the renovations are part of the College’s “ongoing effort to expand and improve the social spaces available”—an oft-criticized aspect of undergraduate life.
“The lecture hall is not the only place where students encounter new ideas at Harvard,” she said in a statement. “By making campus social spaces more inviting, we make it easier for students to connect with—and learn from—one another.”
The money for the renovations will come from a combination of College and Faculty of Arts and Sciences funds budgeted at the end of the last fiscal year, FAS spokesman Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mail.
Eliot Grille, which Hammonds said would be the of first the spaces to be finished, began improvements over the summer, with the purchase of new furniture and audio equipment. Other planned changes, including new lighting and a new coat of paint, will be implemented in time for an “early fall” opening.
The former Pfoho Grille, which was rebranded as the “Quad Grille” last October, will be similarly renovated this winter.
Pfoho House Masters Nicholas A. and Erika L. Christakis ’86 hinted at the possibility of a revamped Junior Common Room, which houses the Quad Grille, in an email to Pfoho students over the summer. In a July 8 email, the House Masters asked for student opinions about buying arcade games for the space, if money were “unexpectedly and improbably” available.
Tuesday morning, the Christakises officially announced the renovation of the JCR, inviting students to participate in an informal brainstorming session during the afternoon. Follow-up meetings are planned for Sept. 26 and Oct. 13. The masters’ email indicated that the House hopes to finalize plans by Oct. 20 and complete construction over winter break, allowing the space to be used in the spring. Possible updates to the Grille include new paint and flooring, the installation of booth seating, and the purchase of vintage arcade games such as Pac-Man.
Another social space in the Quad will also be updated this year. Housed in the former Television Room in the basement of Cabot, the new Cabot Cafe will receive new furniture and lighting after a successful four day preview period last May.
The renovations, which take into account suggestions from students, dining hall workers, and Cabot House administrators, will help align the Cafe’s standards with those of Cambridge licensing laws for shops selling food, according to Cabot Cafe general manager Jesse J. Kaplan ’13. While some of the renovations will be completed before the Cafe opens in late September, Kaplan said that the changes will continue throughout the year.
In addition, Mather’s underutilized woodshop, which is currently used for storage, will be transformed into a new “Mather Multimedia Lab,” featuring video production equipment and a conference area.
Mather House Committee Co-Chair Daniel I. Brandt’ 12, who was involved in the planning of the lab, said it was “the first room of its kind” at Harvard.
Beyond the House system, Hammonds said she will be making changes to the ground floor of the SOCH, currently a largely empty former library lobby. Plans for the renovation are still undecided, and options include the construction of a small stage, increased seating spaces, and expanded food service in addition to the current vending machines in order to create a “living room” for the College, according to SOCH manager Douglas J.D. Walo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent opening of Goorin Brothers—a hat shop located at 43 Brattle Street—brings back a vintage feel to historic Harvard Square.
The new Square location is Goorin Brothers’ 20th store and only the second store on the east coast, following the opening of the Newbury Street store in January.
“After the success of that store was apparent, the company saw that Boston was the place to be,” said Chanelle K. John, the Harvard Square branch’s shopkeeper. “Cambridge has a classic feel and history that suits Goorin’s history.”
John chooses store-featured hats based on local trends. Popular styles in Harvard Square include stingy brim fedoras and straw sun hats, she said.
“[Merchants] talk to designers about what sells, and they listen,” John said. “The designers asked me if there’s something that Harvard wants, and we’ll look out for that.”
The store features new products every few weeks and has collections for each season in both classic and modern styles. Their product lines include Heritage, which are handmade in Pittsburgh, PA, and Panama, which are handwoven in Ecuador. Modern style limited edition baseball caps in the Minna collection are designed by tattoo and graffiti artists from San Francisco.
“Hats are such a great accessory that people can forget about,” said Stephanie D. Vedus, a 22-year-old merchant, who attended Emerson College. “It’s cool to see how much more personality people will have when they’re wearing a hat.”
Each hat features the company’s castle logo inspired by founder Cassel Goorin, who sold hats from a horse cart in Pittsburgh starting in 1895.
The interior design of the store also speaks to the brand, according to John, with a staircase in the center, antique props from the early 1900s, and pictures of the Goorin family, which has continued to manage the business for four generations since its founding. John said she plans to add a library ladder and handmade paintings on the windows.
The San Francisco-based company started opening retail stores seven years ago. Previously they sold hats wholesale through their catalogue.
“We’re known on the west coast as a brand, but we have a strong family vibe,” John said. “Every shopkeeper knows each other, and we connect to each community.”
The store will host hat parties, poetry readings, and charity events throughout the year, starting with a grand opening in October and a food drive in the winter.
John said she treats customers as family and friends and wants their experiences to be fun and educational.
“As a hatter, I want to be able to fit everyone in a hat,” she said. “We want you to walk out feeling confident and excited about the experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Hong Kong restaurant has received approval to extend its dining room hours to 3 a.m. seven days a week.
Paul Lee, the manager of the popular late night food joint, appeared in front of the Cambridge License Commission on Tuesday with his attorney Kevin P. Crane ’73, stating that he wished to provide food in the restaurant area, in addition to take out and delivery services later into the night. The lounge will still close earlier in accordance with its liquor license.
Lee noted that his current license permitted him to stay open until 1 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday and until 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday. Because his restaurant usually served the last call for alcohol 15 minutes before closing, the original closing time only gave customers a short period of time to eat food prior to leaving.
Crane pointed out that there was a precedent in Harvard Square for eateries to serve food past 2 a.m., including the IHOP on Eliot Street, which is open until 4 a.m. and Falafel Corner, which remains open until 3 a.m.
Lee also asked that his Sunday opening hours be moved earlier—from 12 p.m. to 11 a.m. to match his liquor license for Sundays, a discrepancy which technically allowed customers to order alcohol without being able to purchase food.
Over the past month, Lee gathered more than 800 signatures from customers in favor of his proposal, including a large number of Harvard students who signed once they returned to campus, Lee told The Crimson after the meeting.
Students at the time spread unfounded rumors that the City had pressured Lee to close early, which led to outrage over several House email lists.
The effort came out in Lee’s favor.
The Cambridge License Commission, which consisted of Chairman Michael P. Gardner, Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas, and Fire Chief Gerald R. Reardon, approved the restaurant’s application with a 2-1 vote Tuesday night. Gardner dissented, noting he would prefer a trial period that stipulated a 2:30 a.m. closing, as opposed to a 3 a.m. one.
Denise A. Jillson, Harvard Square Business Association executive director appeared in front of the board and spoke in favor of Lee’s petition and in support of more late-night food options in the Square.
The application was also supported by Cambridge City Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, who honored Lee’s father and restaurant founder Sen Lee with a plaque many years ago.
“I’m very happy,” Lee told The Crimson after he heard the board members’ decision.
Lee’s restaurant will undergo a probation period with the new hours for six months before he reappears in front of the board for re-evaluation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours before the men’s soccer team emerged victorious in a nail-biter over Northeastern, the fans at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium witnessed another dramatic win Sunday.
Earlier that afternoon, the Harvard women’s soccer team knocked in the deciding goal with just three minutes left to play, taking down Elon, 2-1.
After dropping a 2-1 decision at Long Island on Friday, the Crimson (1-1) returned to Cambridge determined to win its first home matchup of the season.
Against the Phoenix, Harvard dominated possession and had the clearest chances of the game, but it took until the second half for the Crimson to break a scoreless deadlock.
Co-captain Melanie Baskind scored off a through ball from freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby 11 minutes into the half, but Phoenix midfielder Kimmie Krauss responded in the 83rd minute with a goal to tie the game. The comeback was quickly quelled four minutes later when sophomore Elizabeth Weisman put away a rebound to give the Crimson the win.
“Obviously you want to hold the game and not give up a goal here or there, but to go give up a goal, how you respond really will tell you how the team is going to be,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “That happened Friday night, and we responded; that happened [Sunday] and we responded.”
HARVARD 2, ELON 1
The Crimson found its rhythm and set the contest’s offensive tempo early in the game.
Harvard’s first chance came in the 14th minute when sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro connected with a cross from the right flank only to see her header fly high over an open net.
A minute later, Baskind created enough space from the right to test Elon goaltender Shannon Cosgrove with a shot on goal. The senior led the attack with 10 shots, six of which were on target.
“We ended up in the negative result on Friday, so [Baskind] had to reach deep down today,” Leone said. “She showed great leadership and poise, and she had a really great performance for us.”
The veteran had plenty of help coming from rookie Casscells-Hamby, who was critical in the setup of the game’s first goal. Halfway through the first half, the freshman cut through the middle of the field to send a powerful shot from outside the box to trouble Cosgrove. Casscells-Hamby was second on the team in attempted shots with four.
The Crimson continued attacking the Phoenix goal, creating another opportunity with three minutes left in the first half. A long throw-in from junior Aisha Price led to a scramble in the box, and the Elon defenders failed to clear the ball. Freshman Kate Makaroff ended up with an open shot on goal that she could not put away.
“The freshmen did great stepping up to fill in the holes,” Baskind said. “We definitely have some holes from the graduating class last year, so I think everyone is doing really well coming off the bench.”
Another key performance came from rookie defender Lauren Urke, who took on a more offensive role in the second half.
The freshman demonstrated confidence by dribbling down the right flank several times to get a couple of shots off and cross the ball into the box.
“The kid wants to win,” Leone said. “She saw her moment and she went for it. That’s it; the timing was right.”
With 32:52 left in the second period, Casscells-Hamby slipped a through ball to Baskind, who did not hesitate to put the ball in the right back corner of the net.
A similar play put Elon on the scoreboard. Krauss received a well-timed pass from Catherine Brinkman and imitated Baskind in sending a low shot past rookie goaltender Bethany Kanten with 7:54 left to play.
Baskind responded right away, dribbling the ball straight at the Elon defense and mustering a shot on goal. Another attempt by Baskind with 3:29 on the clock was too strong for the goaltender to wrap up, and Weisman took advantage of the deflected shot to give Harvard the victory.
LONG ISLAND 2, HARVARD 1
The Crimson’s close win came after an equally close loss against Long Island University on Friday.
“It was a great game, played really fast,” Leone said. “The only bad part about the game was the result. We really played hard; so did LIU. They just got two goals, and we got one.”
LIU scored first on Jen Spicer’s shot in the 27th minute that got past junior goalkeeper AJ Millet, who made her first appearance for Harvard since a season-ending injury last year.
The Blackbirds continued to hold onto a one-goal lead until the middle of the second half when Crimson sophomore Peyton Johnson slammed a pass from Casscells-Hamby into the net. The rookie recorded a game-high five attempted shots in addition to the assist.
“[LIU] was a big physical team, but we were able to possess and really play our game,” co-captain Lindsey Kowal said. “It’s a great indication of where our season is going to end up.”
But while Harvard recorded seven more shots on goal than the Blackbirds in the second half, LIU notched the win thanks to junior Ruby Leon’s accuracy against Kanten.
“It’s always hard playing as a fall start,” Baskind said. “We don’t know each other yet, meeting people, trying to make things happen on the field, but it’s going pretty smoothly. We’re creating a ton of chances, which is really nice for this early in the season. We’re getting there—we just need to put the ball in the back of the goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (2-0) completed an undefeated opening weekend, overcoming a negated buzzer-beating goal to win in overtime to cap off the weekend with a 3-2 win over Lafayette (0-2).
The Crimson started the weekend with a 4-0 shutout of Holy Cross (0-3) on Friday at Hart Turf Field in Worcester before taking the field against the Leopards at Jordan Field.
“Great opening weekend,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “It is an opportunity to learn about the team and see what we do well and see how we execute under pressure against two really good opponents—especially Lafayette, a well-coached team—so that was a significant win.”
The Crimson will look to continue the success into next weekend at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
HARVARD 3, LAFAYETTE 2
The Crimson rallied after a call negated the winning goal for Harvard at the end of regulation, pulling out the victory in overtime.
“It was a pretty difficulty opening weekend,” sophomore Bridget McGillivray said. “We usually don’t have such a challenging and strong team on opening weekend such as Lafayette, and I think we stepped up to that challenge.”
Harvard had appeared to score a goal as the regulation buzzer sounded, but as the team swarmed at center field to celebrate, the referees gathered and negated the goal due to an infraction.
“It would have been a wonderful way to walk off the field but there was a foul,” Caples said. “We were able to leave it and transition into overtime, and I think that speaks volumes for the leadership out there and the players being able to make that transition.”
The team then had to regroup and try to win the game again in overtime, during which the Crimson used the momentum of its regulation goal to lead its strong performance in overtime.
“That was pretty difficult [having the goal negated] but I actually think that is the reason why we came out so hard in overtime,” McGillivray said. “We wanted to settle it right away.”
The Crimson came out on fire to start the extra frame, drawing multiple penalties from the Leopards.
Five minutes into overtime, Harvard freshman Sydney Jenkins took the ball into the Lafayette zone and drew a foul.
The Crimson then entered the ball from the corner to Georgia McGillivray, who rifled a shot that her younger sister Bridget redirected into the goal, setting off a second—and official—celebration for Harvard.
“We all really wanted to end it [after the penalty],” Bridget McGillivray said. “Such a great opportunity: [on an] overtime short corner, they only have three players, so we can really use our skills, and Georgia put a great ball in, and I just put the stick down [and deflected it in].”
HARVARD 4, HOLY CROSS 0
The Crimson got off to a great start in the first half, taking a 3-0 lead before finishing off the Crusaders.
“We had lots of preparations and pregame talks,” Bridget McGillivray said. “Our coaches had scouted out these teams beforehand, so we knew what to expect. We were definitely ready.”
The Crimson was led behind the strong play of goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, who recorded four saves leading to the shutout.
Georgia McGillivray got Harvard on the board with her penalty corner goal nine and a half minutes into the contest.
Sophomore teammate Rachel Rosenfeld added to the lead by scoring off a pass from co-captain Carly Dickson.
The Crimson’s Jenkins deflected a shot into the goal making the score 3-0 with 1:17 left in the first half. The lead proved too much for Holy Cross to overcome.
“You get exposed by good teams,” Caples said. “And so we learned a lot about ourselves: things we will work on, but also the strengths, and we are pretty excited about what those are.”
Harvard continued to play well in the second half and completed the shut-out behind the work of Tassopoulos and an added goal from Bridget McGillivray.
“It is so awesome to win right from the start [of the season],” the younger McGillivray said. “We really need that boost of confidence. We are off to a strong start and we hope it carry it on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a cloudless sky and a boisterous crowd of over 2,500 Crimson faithful lining the sidelines, the Harvard men’s soccer team could not have asked for a more picture-perfect season opener.
In its second season as the home field for the Crimson, Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium was filled with an electric atmosphere Sunday night as the capacity crowd spurred Harvard (1-0) to a 1-0 win over cross-town rival Northeastern (2-1).
Sunday’s victory marked the Crimson’s first win of the season and its fifth consecutive victory over the Huskies.
“We had done our homework and we knew that Northeastern was going to be a strong team this year,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “But I knew that if we were disciplined, we could come away with a win.”
After nearly 83 minutes of stalemate, the game was decided by junior forward Brian Rogers, who blasted the ball past Huskies goalkeeper and caused the sidelines, filled with fans, to erupt with cheers.
“I think that it was an absolutely electric crowd tonight,” Junot said. “The two teams on the field were evenly matched tonight, and you could say that our fans lifted us to victory.”
The game began with the home side immediately establishing control of the ball and pressing deep into Huskies territory. By the first minute of play, the Crimson had wrested a corner kick off Northeastern’s defense and looked poised to score. But the Huskies back line held strong and fended off Harvard’s early offensive chances.
Midway into the first half, the Crimson failed to capitalize on a scoring opportunity when co-captain Tim Linden failed to keep his shot on target and missed wide of the net.
Five minutes later, Northeastern earned its own scoring opportunity when sophomore forward Ricardo McDonald received a short pass in the penalty box and blasted a shot toward the left post. Senior goalkeeper Austin Harms, in an acrobatic display, lunged to his right and deflected the ball out of play.
Harms’ save drew gasps followed by thunderous applause from the crowd, re-injecting some energy into the atmosphere.
The end of the first half saw Harvard and Northeastern evenly matched, with the Huskies holding the edge in shots on goal, 6-4.
The second half saw the Crimson slowly increasing pressure on Northeastern. Within the first six minutes of play in the second half, senior midfielder Jamie Rees delivered two shots on goal, each flying just wide of the net.
Halfway into the second half, with the raucous crowd chanting spiritedly, the game’s momentum and transferred firmly into the hands of the home side. Harvard had scoring opportunity after opportunity, but the Huskies back line held firm and kept all threats at bay.
In the 66th minute, Rogers had a good chance on goal when his height, positioning, and hustle produced a header that flew high over the crossbar.
Rogers’ attempt on goal was a harbinger of what would come late in the second half, when the junior forward, working off a deflected corner kick by Linden, hustled his way past the Huskies back line to blast the game-winning goal past Northeastern goalkeeper Oliver Blum.
“After that goal, all I felt was pure happiness and excitement,” Rogers said. “It was a tight game, and I think that it was a bit of luck that the ball landed in front of me, but I was happy that I was able to put it away.”
With just seven minutes left in the game, the goal proved to be the difference maker in the contest, as it further emboldened the Crimson’s attack. In the waning minutes of the game, Harvard would record two additional shots on goal.
“It was a strong team effort overall,” Junot said. “We tend to focus more on the character of our team rather than just on the soccer tactics, and I was impressed with the character of our group tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing a cross-town rival and then a nationally ranked California team all on its opening day, Harvard men’s water polo plunged right into the excitement of the fall season this weekend at the MIT Invitational.
The Crimson downed MIT, 13-5, early Saturday morning with scoring contributions from eight Harvard players. But, later that day, the Crimson found itself on the opposite end of the board when it fell, 13-9, to No. 17 Cal Baptist,
“It was a great way to start off the season,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “MIT is our rival, and they beat us twice last year ... [and] Cal Baptist is really tough, so I was really happy with the starting play.”
Senior goalie Alex Popp led Harvard defensively with 18 saves over the two games.
He had three one-on-nobody blocks against the Lancers’ attackers, and provided the Crimson with a consistency that is usually hard to find this early in the season.
“He is the cornerstone of our defense,” Minnis said. “He’s going to allow us to do so many things this year in our defense that we weren’t able to do last year.”
CAL BAPTIST 13, HARVARD 9
Despite keeping pace with Cal Baptist throughout the second and third quarters, Harvard was unable to overcome its poor performances in the two rough quarters that book-ended the afternoon competition.
The Lancers had speed on their side and were able to spring to a quick 3-0 lead in the opening minutes of the game. Minnis called a time-out four minutes in to give the Crimson a very important reminder.
“Let’s focus on the defense, get stops, and the offense will come,” Minnis said. “We just settled down and started playing defense.”
The reminder proved helpful as Harvard caught up in the following quarters and knotted the score at both four and five goals apiece.
Harvard ran with its nationally ranked opponent up until the last five minutes of the game, when the score was again tied, this time at nine goals apiece.
A series of mistakes on the Crimson’s behalf allowed the Lancers to capitalize and create a four-goal gap in the last few minutes of the game.
“Mental mistakes took us out of the game,” Popp said. “They were looking for the counter, and we just let them get past us rather than anticipate that movement. “
HARVARD 13, MIT 5
After nearly three weeks of preseason practices and intra-squad scrimmages, the Harvard men were more than ready to start the season and face the Engineers by the time Saturday morning rolled around.
But, according to Minnis, this excitement may have actually hurt the Crimson in the first quarter.
“We had been doing two-a-days all month and six of our guys had never played in a college game—we were ready to play someone else,” Minnis said. “Everyone was so revved up that we missed eight shots in the first quarter.”
Once the team settled, Harvard was able to execute its plays much more effectively, scoring five goals in the second quarter alone.
After graduating its top three scorers from last season, the Crimson proved it will have to rely on its depth, rather than star power, to have a successful season this fall.
“We are a way deeper team than last year and are able to use quick subbing rotations,” Minnis said. “We slowed [MIT] down until the fourth quarter rolled around. We were fresh and countering and they couldn’t keep up.”
Eight Crimson players put up points in the MIT game, including Luka Babic, Kevin DiSilvestro, Max Eliot, Will Roller, and Evan Zepfel, who all scored two goals apiece.
“Where we are right now is leaps and bounds ahead of where we were last year at the end of the season,” Popp said. “We just need to keep working hard at practice and take a step forward everyday and, hopefully, by the end of November, we will by playing our best water polo at Easterns.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although its first game of the Georgia State Invitational was not the ideal way to start the season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team rallied from a 3-2 loss against the College of Charleston to take home a pair of wins to close its opening weekend.
The Crimson started off strong in its first match of the weekend against the Cougars­—the eventual tournament winners—taking the first two games, before College of Charleston fought back to capture the remaining three games.
“After the first match we were obviously disappointed because we had won the first two sets,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “But we saw some good things along with the bad ... and tried to focus on the positive.”
Harvard certainly found its groove after the initial match, battling in a second five-set match and dominating in a 3-0 shutout against Georgia State and Jacksonville State, respectively.
HARVARD 3, JACKSONVILLE STATE 0
After being forced into five-set matches in the previous two games, the Crimson did not let its momentum slip in its final match against the Gamecocks, posting a dominant 3-0 win.
Harvard began the match in the same fashion it had against its preceding opponents: with a two-game lead. However, unlike in its earlier two matches, the Crimson never relinquished its early advantage.
In the first set of the match, both teams put up a fight, drawing even at 22-22 before Harvard took control of the game, taking advantage of Gamecock errors. Co-captain Sandra Lynn Fryhofer sealed the deal with a kill for the 25-23 win.
The second set was much of the same, with the victor determined late in the game. Harvard improved to a .421 hitting percentage and recorded a strong 17 kills en route to its 25-22 win.
The Crimson left nothing to chance in the third and final set, garnering a 17-15 lead over the Jacksonville State and refusing to give it up. Harvard took the game, 25-20, and ultimately the match without a dropped set.
Junior Taylor Docter and sophomore Erin Cooney led the offensive effort, recording 11 and 10 kills respectively, while junior Beth Kinsella contributed with an impressive 35 assists in the victory. Sophomore Teresa Skelly and Fryhofer bolstered the defense, posting four blocks each for the Crimson.
“We played amazing in the final match,” Wu said. “It was a solid ending to a great opening weekend.”
HARVARD 3, GEORGIA STATE 2
Coming off of a loss in its opening match against the Cougars, Harvard revived and came off on the winning end of another competitive match against Georgia State.
The situation going into the fifth set was all too familiar for the Crimson, which had taken the first two games of the match, 25-22 and 25-16, but was facing an opponent that had turned the tables in the third and fourth sets with a pair of 25-22 game victories.
But Harvard ended the Panthers comeback in the decisive fifth set, recapturing the momentum for an exciting 3-2 win over the hosts. Docter, Cooney, and Skelly again led the offense, with 17, 11, and 13 kills respectively, while Kinsella added a notable 50 assists. Fryhofer worked well on both ends, posting 13 blocks and six kills for the Crimson in the victory.
“By the second match, we had a lot more confidence and had gotten more used to playing with each other,”  Fryhofer said. “We had to fight back again ... but we came out really strong.”
COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON 3,    HARVARD 2
After entering its opening weekend with high hopes, Harvard left its first match with a sense of disappointment, after falling to the College of Charleston in a thrilling but ultimately losing endeavor.
The Crimson came out with a bang, securing the first two games of the match, 25-19 and 25-23, respectively, and it looked as if it would have smooth sailing to a 1-0 record, but the Cougars came back with a bite.
The College of Charleston opened the third set on a 8-1 run that culminated in a dominant 25-13 win.
Harvard fell behind again in the fourth set, only to recover and level the playing field at 21 and again at 22, before finally losing following a Cougar ace.
Both teams went back and forth in the final game, tying at 10-10, but the College of Charleston answered with three kills that effectively determined the match. A final kill from the Cougars decided the 15-12 victory.
It was a disappointing start, but a start that did not determine the tone for the remainder of the tournament for a young Crimson squad.
“I thought it was one of the best preseason tournaments Harvard has had since I’ve been here,” Fryhofer said. “It’s a good indicator that we can hold our own against strong teams ... and persevere in tough situations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two former Crimson men’s soccer standouts currently playing in Major League Soccer—Michael Fucito ’09 and Andre Akpan ’10—are making their presences felt as the 2011 MLS season continues into the late regular season and into the CONCACAF Champions League Group Stage.
On Aug. 16, former Crimson midfielder Fucito scored two goals for the Seattle Sounders in the team's 4-1 Champions League victory against Guatemalan side Comunicaciones. While a day later, former Harvard forward Andre Akpan had a goal and an assist to lead the Colorado Rapids to a 3-2 comeback win over the El Salvadoran club Metapán. On Aug. 27, Fucito scored the fourth goal in the Sounders’ 6-2 demolition of the Columbus Crew.
Fucito, who has been receiving more playing time with the Sounders as of late, has appeared in 17 games and started in 10 so far in 2011. Out of his 17 appearances, 13 have come in regular-season MLS play, with his remaining appearances shared between the U.S. Open Cup and during continental club play in the 2011 CONCACAF Champions League.
At 13-5-9 on the year, Fucito and the Sounders currently hold the second-best record in MLS and stand in second in the Western Conference with 48 points, four points behind the LA Galaxy.
During his time at Harvard, Fucito completed his collegiate career ranked fourth in scoring in Crimson soccer annals with 32 career goals. He also boasts 24 assists despite playing injured in his final two seasons.
In just his second year in the MLS, Akpan has similarly been featured in many of the Colorado Rapids games this season. In his 12 game appearances, Akpan has started in five. During his time at Harvard, Akpan scored 47 goals and added 33 assists to finish his collegiate career as the Crimson’s all-time leading scorer.
At 10-7-11, the Rapids currently stand in fifth in the Western Conference with 41 points.

When September ends, students in the Quad will be able to sip on freshly brewed coffee and nibble on fudge walnut brownies at the new student-run coffee house in the vicinity of their Houses.
Cabot Café, located in Cabot E-007 in the basement of Cabot E entryway, will officially open in late September. In addition to offering coffee, tea, espresso drinks, and baked goods late at night, the café aims to serve as a social space for students to hang out and as a venue for artists to perform.
Cabot Café was the brainchild of Cabot residents Laura S. Hinton '13, Jesse J. Kaplan '13, Chandan G. Lodha '13, and Crimson photo editor Daniel M. Lynch '13. After realizing the need for a social space, these four friends proposed the idea of a coffee house to their House Masters and tested it during the spring preview.
Roisin L. Duffy-Gideon '12, who attended the café's four-day preview period last May, said she was amazed by the transformation of the space, which was formally known as "the Television Room."
"[Cabot Café] feels like a regular coffee house, except you are surrounded by all your friends," Duffy-Gideon said, adding that the pastries and coffee at Cabot Café are much more delicious than the food served during Brain Break in the dining halls.
Kaplan, who now serves as the general manager of Cabot Café, said the café is unique in that it also provides a space for student musicians to perform and photographers and artists to display their artwork.
"We intend to have students play their guitar or piano, sing, perform spoken word or slam poetry, and put up their artworks," Kaplan said.
Spatially, Hinton said Cabot Café caters to the students in the Quad, providing a smaller and more personal place to hang out.
"Lamont Café is not convenient for people in the Quad," she said.
Though the café hours are still tentative, Kaplan said it will probably be open from 8 p.m. to midnight, Sunday through Thursday. Cabot Café accepts cash, BoardPlus, and Crimson Cash.
Cabot Café is currently hiring between 10 and 15 baristas, who will get paid $10 an hour to prepare drinks and serve food to the customers, as well as help to coordinate student performances.

When "The Social Network" came out around a year ago, everyone became fascinated by the story of Mark E. Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook. A year later the question arises, "what's the next big thing?"
 
Comedy group Fatawesome attempts to answer this question in their video featured on Cracked.com called "Trying to Recreate 'The Social Network' at Harvard Today." 
 
The video follows the group interviewing various people around the Yard in an attempt to discover what amazing and, more importantly, profitable projects and ideas people are developing. The trolling results in explanations of everything from a Matrix-Second-Life-Sims game to a soccer ball that generates electricity. The video concludes with Fatawesome giving an underachieving proposal of their idea to what appear to be investors.
 
Although the video is an attempt at humor, it also shows that for every "next big thing" Harvard students discover, there are numerous "meh" things they discover as well.
