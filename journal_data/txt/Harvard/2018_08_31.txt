After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser and Economics Professor David I. Laibson ’88 will serve as the faculty deans of Lowell House beginning next academic year, Lowell’s current faculty deans announced in an email  to House affiliates Thursday.
Zipser and Laibson will take over from  Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin, who will hold the job until the end of this academic year. Eck and Austin — affectionately known as “D & D” — have served as Lowell’s faculty deans for 20 years.
The new deans will take over during the first year after the renovated Lowell House opens. Lowell — the fifth of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate residential houses to be renewed — is currently in the second year of its two-year renovation project.
In the meantime, Zipser and Laibson will join Lowell’s Senior Common Room — a group of nonresidential House affiliates — and adjust to leading the House this year, per Eck and Austin’s email.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email announcing the appointment to College affiliates that he thinks Zipser and Laibson will be great faculty deans.
“Nina and David bring extraordinary passion and remarkable commitment to fostering the education of the next generation of leaders, and they will be tremendous assets to Lowell House and Harvard’s residential community,” he wrote.
Eck and Austin announced in March that they would step down next year, and wrote that a search committee comprising students, staff, and members of Lowell’s Senior Common Room would choose their successors before the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year.
In an interview Thursday, Laibson said he and Zipser are “ecstatic” to be leading Lowell next academic year.
“We see our students going on to do so many exciting and important things and to be a bigger part of their lives is very important to us,” he said.
Zipser and Laibson will come to their new posts with years of experience at Harvard. Zipser, who earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard in 2000, began teaching math at the University in 2003 and became Dean for Faculty Affairs in 2008. After earning his undergraduate degree from the College and studying at the London School of Economics as a Marshall Scholar, Laibson returned to Harvard in 1994 and has taught at the University ever since. From 2015-2018, he served as chair of the economics department.
In their email, Eck and Austin wrote they think Zisper and Laibson are a “perfect ‘fit’ for the House.”
“David and Nina are deeply humanistic and interested in the people-oriented aspect of their vocational calling,” Eck and Austin wrote. “They are fun to be with and full of ideas.”
Khurana praised Eck and Austin for creating a “vibrant intergenerational community” at Lowell.
“I am so grateful to Diana and Dorothy for the immeasurable work they have done supporting our students in ways large and small,” he wrote. “They will leave behind a legacy of inclusiveness and bringing out the best in those around them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-five Harvard student and alumni groups argued in court documents Thursday that the University’s race-conscious admissions policies are vital to the school’s educational mission.
“Given racial bias in standardized testing and endemic racial inequities in educational opportunities in primary and secondary school, Harvard must consider race if it is to assemble a diverse student body and achieve the educational benefits thereof,” lawyers representing the students wrote in the filing.
The students’ brief comes as part of an ongoing lawsuit that alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants, a charge the University has repeatedly denied. Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions brought the suit in 2014.
The student groups are partly being represented by lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Some of the groups seek to promote diversity or public service on Harvard’s campus, while others are affinity organizations. Ten of the groups are specifically targeted to Asian or Asian-American students.
The students’ brief was one of several filed Thursday. Economists, social scientists, and academics — as well as prominent legal organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union — also entered amicus briefs in support of Harvard’s admissions practices.
At least one brief fell decidedly on the other side of the issue. The United States Department of Justice on Thursday morning filed a statement of interest asserting Harvard’s admissions process inflicts “unlawful racial discrimination” against Asian-American hopefuls.
In their brief, the students noted that SFFA’s goal is to eliminate the use of race in college admissions — something the group’s president Edward Blum previously admitted to The Crimson in an email. The students’ filing argues the loss of affirmative action would lead to discrimination against minority students including Asian Americans.
If universities could no longer consider race, the filing states, “applicants would no longer be able to present their authentic selves in their applications, deterring and disadvantaging applicants whose leadership and other experiences are inextricably intertwined with their racial and cultural heritage.”
Contrary to SFFA’s rhetoric, the student groups argue that race-conscious admissions actually benefits some Asian American applicants, especially those who are flagged as coming from “disadvantaged” backgrounds.
“Within the category of disadvantaged applicants, Asian Americans receive the largest preference in admissions,” the document reads. “Attention to the particular disadvantages faced by Asian Americans is important because this group has the highest intra-racial inequality.”
The students’ filing is specifically arguing against SFFA’s motion to decide the case without a trial. Experts have said that is unlikely.
The suit is set to go to trial in a Boston courtroom on Oct. 15.
The groups that signed the brief include:
21 Colorful Crimson
Harvard Black Alumni Society
Association of Black Harvard Women
Coalition for a Diverse Harvard
First Generation Harvard Alumni
Fuerza Latina of Harvard
Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance
Harvard Asian American Brotherhood
Harvard Islamic Society
Harvard Japan Society
Harvard Korean Association
Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance
Harvard Minority Association of Pre-Medical Students
Harvard Phillips Brooks House Association
Harvard South Asian Association

Correction: Sept. 5, 2018
A previous version of this story indicated that the 25 student groups are partly being represented by lawyers from the NAACP. In fact, they are being represented by lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New Title IX policies the U.S. Department of Education is reportedly considering would likely force Harvard to change its policy and procedures for addressing sexual assault and harassment, according to legal experts.
The New York Times first reported that the department is considering changing its policies Wednesday, though the DOE has yet to make an official announcement. The Times reported that the updated guidance would mean schools are no longer responsible for incidences of sexual harassment that take place off-campus; would change the standards for filing Title IX complaints against universities; and would apply a narrower definition of sexual harassment, among other changes.
Many schools — including Harvard — based their current policies for addressing sexual misconduct on Obama-era guidelines issued in 2011. DeVos rescinded those guidelines in Sept. 2017 and offered a fresh set in their place. None required Harvard to shift its policies and the University’s top Title IX administrators pledged to stick to the old rules.
Now, though, keeping the status quo may not be an option, according to experts. Colby Bruno, a lawyer with the Victim Rights Law Center, said the reported changes would require universities like Harvard to revise their Title IX policies.
Unlike the Obama-era guidance, DeVos’s proposed regulations, if enacted, will carry legal weight because they will have passed through the federal rulemaking process.
Liz Hill, an Education Department spokesperson, told the Times that the department is “in the midst of a deliberative process” and that the Times’s information “is premature and speculative, and therefore, we have no comment.”
Bruno said the changes to Title IX rules could generate confusion on campuses across the country.
“If every four years we keep swinging from one side to the other, it just doesn’t help us,” Bruno said. “If I’m a school, I don’t know what I’m doing.”
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that “the safety and well-being of our community remains the University’s top priority.”
“We have worked hard in recent years to develop strong and fair policies and procedures, to increase the support services available to our community members, and to raise awareness of them across campus,” she wrote.
Harvard’s current Title IX policy was forged in 2014 and uses the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, the lowest legal standard of proof and the one suggested in the 2011 guidance. The new policies, however, would allow schools to choose between “preponderance of the evidence” or a stricter “clear and convincing” standard initially laid out in DeVos’s 2017 guidelines, according to the Times.
Harvard's policy and procedures have drawn controversy in their four years of existence. A group of professors at Harvard Law School charged that the definition of sexual assault laid out in Harvard’s policy is inappropriate and that the University’s procedures deny due process to the accused. The professors successfully led the charge for Law School-specific procedures in 2014 — and several submitted a memo to the Dept. of Education in Sept. 2017 calling for a narrower federal definition of sexual harassment.
In a break from precedent, the proposed rules define sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school’s education program or activity.”
Harvard’s current definition of sexual harassment, based on the Obama administration’s broader definition, is “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, graphic, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”
The new policies also reportedly alter the standard the department will use when judging whether a school took the right steps to address allegations of sexual assault. The standard, called “deliberately indifferent,” would only find the school to be in violation of Title IX if its “response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.”
Bruno said such a policy shift would make it nearly impossible to bring an Office of Civil Rights complaint against a school’s handling of a Title IX complaint. Harvard currently faces three OCR investigations into its handling of complaints opened in 2014, 2016, and 2017.
Under the DeVos policy, schools would also only be responsible for conduct that takes place on campus or within its own programs, which would exclude off-campus parties and events. The 2011 Obama administration guidance required schools to investigate complaints even if they took place off campus.
The change would mean that incidents that occur at final clubs or properties not owned by Harvard would no longer fall under the University’s purview — at least in the eyes of the government. A 2015 campus climate survey found that 47 percent of senior women who reported participating in final clubs — as members or as attendees of male final club events — reported “experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college,” the highest figure among any student group included in the data.
The government would also hold schools responsible only for investigating formal complaints, which are those made to “an official who has the authority to institute corrective measures.” This would remove Harvard’s legal responsibility for incidents brought to the attention of faculty and staff via more casual channels.
The new rules would also make it optional for schools to offer appeals processes and recommend schools use mediation to settle Title IX disputes, according to the Times report. The Obama administration recommended allowing appeals and advised against mediation. An FAQ document accompanying Harvard’s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and Procedures says the school will not use mediation in cases of sexual assault.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization, said the new policies would force schools to “walk back” changes they’ve made to Title IX policies and procedures in recent years.
“Harvard is going to have to recognize that its policies will be impacted by this process,” Goldberg said. “That means that protecting its students and preserving its position as a leader among its peer institutions must include actively participating in this policymaking process.”
