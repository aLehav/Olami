After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 19th century, American railroads were the engine of rapid industrialization and growth, bringing new Americans and their attendant prosperity to far-off corners of the then-unsettled country. American passenger trains carried millions of new soldiers to their training depots and their ports of call during the two World Wars, and, until the expansion of the interstate highway system in the 1950s, rail travel remained the only reliable and affordable method for traversing the country. But, since then, American passenger rail has steadily declined in both prestige and ridership; in 1971, the federal government effectively bought out the dying industry under the aegis of the taxpayer-backed firm Amtrak.
Today, the vast majority of Americans travel by either car or airplane, depending on the distance of their journey. This has contributed to our debilitating dependence on foreign oil and has made our transportation system lag behind others in the developed world, as countries like South Korea, France, Taiwan, and Spain have invested heavily in relatively efficient, fast, and safe high-speed trains that connect major metropolitan areas. Even China, the world’s largest developing economy, is making strides in this area—one can now take a high-speed bullet train from Pudong airport to downtown Shanghai in less than 20 minutes.
But change may soon be coming to America. On Thursday, President Obama outlined a proposal that would revitalize the passenger rail network of the United States by providing $8 billion in funding from the recently passed $787 billion stimulus package for high-speed rail networks, especially along the Northeast Corridor. We applaud the president’s bold maneuver and hope to see him follow through on his lofty rhetoric with real change in the way that the federal government treats the entire issue of high-speed rail travel. 
Compared to the interstate highway system and the massive network of domestic airlines, high-speed rail is more energy-efficient and less costly per mile and provides an easy, efficient, and safe method of transportation. As such, we believe that a new national program of high-speed rail construction will be a worthwhile investment in infrastructure and job creation in the midst of the worst recession in more than two decades. In addition to the immediate benefits of job creation in the construction industry, the expansion of passenger rail travel will also provide jobs far into the future across the country. 
Of course, building a viable system of high-speed rail lines is far easier said than done. Critics of Amtrak, the government-owned corporation that currently administers America’s aging and inefficient passenger rail system, have correctly pointed out that the current system is not only unprofitable, but also horrendously mismanaged. Moreover, ticket prices remain prohibitively expensive on the only real high-speed network in the country, the Acela Express that runs between Washington and Boston. 
As such, for high-speed rail to become a viable form of mass transportation in this country, any new initiative must be a truly competitive alternative to the dominant automotive and airline industries. Amtrak’s poor track record has given rise to the false assumption that American culture is somehow incompatible with mass transit or railroads; this is absolutely false. Poor management practices should be remedied by decisive action—for starters, President Obama ought to encourage private industry to cooperate with Amtrak by offering tax breaks for those firms willing to cooperate on the proposed renovation plan for the Acela. 
While there is no doubt that this is a challenging task, encouraging trends have emerged in recent years. Just one day after Obama’s speech, the governors of eight Midwestern states sent the president a letter urging him to support a new proposed plan that would connect Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, and Madison, Wisconsin with a network of fast passenger trains. And, while, Amtrak’s trans-continental lines may be the object of ridicule, ridership on the Acela line has grown rapidly as fuel prices have made air and car travel less attractive to business commuters. We hope that new plans for high-speed rail expansion will build on this progress and make American rail travel a viable option once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At his town hall meeting last week, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said that he had identified some reductions in discretionary spending but that these only accounted for about a third of the unprecedented $220 million deficit. Though the faculty is edging toward layoffs and has already mothballed construction projects, it is unlikely that these will be enough to plug the deficit. Instead of obfuscating and offering platitudes, university administrators ought to get serious about fiscal reform. To that end, Harvard’s leaders must lead by example and call for more shared sacrifices from faculty and students. 
For starters, Harvard’s top brass should reduce their own salaries. This goes for the president, the provost, the deans of the faculty and College, and all of their top managers. During his last year as president, Lawrence H. Summers earned just under $600,000. In general, deans make good money too: according to her federal disclosure forms, former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan earned $437,000 last year. Pay cuts of $50,000 to $100,000 for each senior manager would show that they too are feeling the pain of the downturn and could save well over a million dollars if implemented broadly. 
Second, Harvard should ask its faculty to take temporary pay reductions—perhaps through furlough days—to bring their salaries in line with those of our peer institutions. This academic year, Harvard paid its full professors an average of $192,600, according to the American Association of University Professors. By contrast, Stanford paid its professors $181,900, Princeton paid $180,300, and Yale paid $174,700. Asking our professors to accept the same salaries as their counterparts at Stanford seems fair, especially considering that, just two years ago, the average salary at Harvard was $177,400. The faculty has about 450 full professors, and paying at Stanford levels would save about $10,000 per head, a total savings of about $4.5 million.
As Harvard asks its faculty to pitch in, it should call for similar sacrifice from students and parents who can afford to pay a bit more. While pulling back on financial aid—just as Smith’s predecessor, the late Jeremy R. Knowles, did during an earlier fiscal crisis—would generate bad press, doing so is necessary and, ultimately, fair. Such a reduction should be confined to the newest aid initiative—the one that benefits those families earning up to $180,000—and not the previous programs for those earning less than $60,000. 
Under the current 10-percent plan, families earning $180,000 pay just $18,000 per year. For the next few years, we can justifiably ask these upper-income families to kick in a bit more—say, $22,000 or 12 percent. Scaling back half of the newest initiative, which was projected to cost $22 million but will likely cost significantly more, would leave our financial aid program between where it was at the end of the Summers presidency (very good) and where it is now (extraordinarily generous).
Finally, Harvard should cut its wasteful internal public relations division. The Harvard Gazette and the other fluff put out by the Harvard Office of Communications, like The Yard, ought to be axed on both financial and environmental grounds. The publications and their staffs cost a few million dollars each year. Externally, they do nothing to strengthen Harvard’s brand. Internally, they are rightfully regarded as propaganda. 
Harvard’s leaders are right in focusing our limited resources on our core missions: research and teaching. Staff layoffs, construction slowdowns, and faculty recruitment freezes will be necessary. But the magnitude of the endowment decline makes it unlikely that the budget can be balanced without more shared sacrifice. 
Given the political realities of the university, it may be tempting to just either float debt or ask for more money from the endowment. But kicking this ball down the road, either by mortgaging the university or drawing down its savings, simply leaves the problem for our successors to clean up. All of us—administrators, faculty, and students—will simply have to make do without some of what we’re used to.Paras D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rational part of me knows that the new HOLLIS search system is much improved. It’s got a snazzy new look, it integrates different types of media in one search, and it’s even got spelling suggestions. But I still find myself clinging to the classic HOLLIS system like an old security blanket. It may be simple and worn out, but at least it’s familiar.
Fortunately, my irrational dislike of change has a scientific explanation. People generally prefer things they have seen before, which is something psychologists call the “mere exposure effect.” The frequency of contact consumers have with a product also plays a role. If Delta Air Lines announces a new design for its signs and logos, it’s not a huge deal because people only fly infrequently. On the other hand, when customers use a product every day, the effects of a redesign can be jarring. 
People rarely approve when a newspaper, the quintessential quotidian good, changes its layout. Similarly, when Starbucks briefly started using its old logo on coffee cups about a year ago, daily drinkers weren’t happy. And, when the Red Sox announced they would be wearing new “retro” gray road uniforms last December, the fan response was tepid at best, with the greatest vitriol directed at the biggest change—putting hanging socks on the hat. Baseball games occur almost daily during the summer months, so it’s not surprising that fans would bristle.
The issue of daily usage helps explain the most reviled design change this year, the latest version of Facebook that aired in Februrary. The newest Facebook is a perfect storm of redesign hatred because of the website’s widespread use and the intense need for familiarity by its users. 
By its own count, Facebook has more than 200 million active users, half of whom log on once per day. Users obsess over their profile photo and information in the “About Me” section, and they certainly don’t want the look of their profile changed without permission.
In the past, Facebook has been fairly sensitive to its customers when adding new features that were initially unpopular. The addition in 2006 of a news feed—a box brimming with information about friends’ actions, such as changing relationship statuses or uploading photos—was criticized for infringing upon user privacy. Founder Mark Zuckerberg responded by asking people to “calm down” and then introduced settings that allowed users to limit the information that would appear in other users’ feeds. Last summer, people were given an option of switching to a new layout before everyone was automatically switched over in September 2008. 
But the changes made during the last two months did more than just add features. They altered the core concept behind the website, essentially condensing all of its features, including posts between friends, into a constant stream of Twitter-esque news snippets. This time, there was no “trial” period, but only a short notice about a week before the changes took effect.
Things quickly got ugly. In a poll on Facebook’s website, 94 percent of voters were against the new design. Even Facebook employees apparently were dissatisfied, leading Zuckerberg to send an internal email saying that companies shouldn’t listen to their customers. 
But Zuckerberg must be at least partially right, because no one is leaving. In fact, Facebook continues to grow. Are users too addicted to quit? It’s more likely that Facebook usage became so widespread that, like cell phones and e-mail, people of a certain age would be more inconvenienced by signing off than by sticking with a flawed system. 
For newspapers, an industry already in steep decline, an unpopular redesign can be the last straw that pushes readers to cancel their subscription. A survey of major paper redesigns in the last five years suggests that most papers either continued to slide or did worse after changing their design. Thus, back in 2006, when Facebook was still an upstart company trying to compete with MySpace, Zuckerberg had to tread more lightly to cater to his fledgling user base. With Facebook now as healthy as ever, Zuckerberg is free to change what he wants, when he wants to.
Personally, I don’t care for the changes. I think of Facebook as a way to organize group photos and learn about parties, not a social news ticker. However, it’s entirely possible that I don’t like the new Facebook because I simply crave familiarity like the rest of humanity. If Facebook had these features from the beginning and the management tried to remove them, I’m sure that the outcry would be just as loud. Since Facebook has no incentive to budge, we might as well try to get used to the changes. That’s the beauty of the exposure effect: Pretty soon, everything new becomes familiar again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, members of the Student Labor Action Movement (SLAM) invaded Eliot House during University President Drew Faust’s lunch, rudely interrupting her and the group of students she was speaking with to deliver a message: “Greed is the new Crimson.” After effectively mocking Faust’s own “green” initiative, SLAM unconditionally demanded that Faust meet with them within the next two weeks and rescind all layoffs of university employees since October 2008. This hyperbole, rudeness, and radicalism runs contrary to the spirit of academic debate, and Harvard’s students and administration should reject both SLAM’s tactics and its untenable message.
SLAM’s campaign, called “No Layoffs,” rests on the faulty assumption that Harvard in some way “owes” work and high wages to its employees. A SLAM flyer asserts that, “Harvard enjoys the financial benefits of a nonprofit, without the responsibility. If Harvard is to receive so much from tax-payers, it must provide secure jobs that support the economy.” But Harvard does have an enormous responsibility—that of educating around 20,000 individuals a year. The university is tasked with producing knowledge and research that ranges from cures for diseases to models for understanding modernity. Harvard exists as a center of teaching and scholarship, and it is these activities that the government and taxpayers have deemed valuable enough to afford it tax-exempt status.
Like any institution, Harvard provides low-level jobs, but they arise as a secondary benefit to individuals and the community. To argue that exemption from taxes implies some obligation to provide “secure” jobs would be to argue that other institutions, such as churches, must also hire a certain number of people. This claim is ridiculous, just as is SLAM’s belief that Harvard has a responsibility to create low-level employment opportunities.
The No Layoffs Campaign blog argues that, “Workers—every worker, including the lowest paid janitor or library technician—are vital to the ‘core mission’ of educating and intellectual research.” It is certainly true that every worker contributes to our current quality of life here at Harvard, and they are to be thanked for this. But not every job, and therefore not every worker, is “vital.” Part of the discussion regarding layoffs has involved reducing the amount of work that must be done, such as cleaning public spaces less often. Certain “quality of life” elements are luxuries; entryway staircases do not need to be mopped every week, and students could clean their own bathrooms as they do at other universities. By reconsidering what kind of work is considered essential, Harvard could easily eliminate the necessity for some workers.
Further, Harvard is currently slowing down construction in Allston, freezing budgets, and slowing the hiring of new faculty. Some academic programs have had to cut the number of students they admit. If Harvard does not even have enough money for these activities central to a research and teaching institution, then luxuries should certainly be dispensed with, even if this means less work for janitors and other staff.
In any case, SLAM’s expectations are contradictory. The group argues, on the one hand, that Harvard does not need to fire workers. It claims that Harvard could do more and that the university could be more creative in dealing with the crisis. At the same time, it demands that Harvard release more information regarding its finances. It is unreasonable to condemn Harvard’s decisions while simultaneously admitting ignorance of the university’s financial situation and current efforts. This lack of reason only disincentivizes Harvard from providing more information—in SLAM’s view, Harvard’s guilt and nefarious motives are a foregone conclusion, and releasing additional data will not change that.
To viscerally and hyperbolically condemn Harvard’s actions and motives while demanding that administrators sacrifice time and energy to their complaints, however, is only too typical of SLAM’s general approach. SLAM’s interruption of Faust’s lunch is only one example of their bully tactics. Slogans in past campaigns have included such gems as “Harvard you’ve got cash, why do you pay your workers trash?” and “What’s outrageous? Harvard’s wages.” And SLAM’s continued references to Harvard’s “greed” in considering laying off workers following an institutional loss of around $16 billion this year stretches the bounds of credibility.
In fact, on the issue of worker layoffs, Harvard has been far from “greedy.” Instead of simply firing workers, it has offered them lucrative early retirement plans and has limited layoffs at a time when many institutions are cutting hundreds or even thousands of workers. While the Harvard community rightly values workers on campus, in the end Harvard’s primary mission as a teaching and research institution must come before protecting unnecessary jobs. SLAM defies that primary goal by stifling academic debate through their coercive approach, and creating a divisive, charged environment inconducive to the cooperation our university needs to productively address the crisis it faces.

In the war against Harvard staff layoffs, the Student Labor Action Movement (SLAM) has just chosen a new battlefront for its latest guerilla attack—the desktop backgrounds on Lamont computers.
Members have apparently been changing the backgrounds to display the group’s slogan, “Greed is the new Crimson,” prompting one student worker at Lamont to gripe in an email, “Note the absence of ‘constantly resetting desktop backgrounds’ in the above list [of my job responsibilities].  While I know you enjoy creating more work opportunities for others, please spare me the courtesy.”  Ouch.  Sorry, SLAM, we’re sure you meant well.
More on how the group’s been slamming Harvard, after the jump.
SLAM has a petition, that sets out its demands, including a meeting with university administration, the suspension of layoffs, and the recall of all workers let go since October 2008.
SLAM’s other strategies have included unfurling banners in public places—everywhere from Annenberg to Dean Smith’s town hall meeting
to President Faust’s lunch at Eliot.  The group has also staged rallies against layoffs, most recently this past Thursday, in front of the Holyoke Center.
So is Harvard listening?  Are the new desktop backgrounds working?  We can’t judge yet whether or not SLAM’s tactics are actually helping workers, but at least students seem to be paying attention—kind of.  Some were taken by the grammatical implications of the phrase “Greed is the new Crimson.”  We were especially amused by this highly Harvardian response to a SLAM email:
“Perhaps they haven't responded because ‘greed’ unlike ‘crimson’ is not a color, and therefore saying ‘greed is the new crimson’ would be lexically similar to saying to ‘koala is the new circle’—a situation in which you are trying to include a member of a class of nouns (in my case animals) into a pre-existing class of nouns (such as shapes).  Perhaps if you had refined your message into a nuanced argument comprised of phrases that made coherent sense instead of a mindless slogan, then the President and Corporation would be better able to understand and respond to your concerns.”
FlyBy isn’t by any means against labor rights, but we might have to agree—with a philosophy that seems to boil down to the poster slogan “Harvard is rich, no layoffs,”—nuance just isn’t one of the SLAM’s strengths.

It's Market Day for Pfoho, Currier, Eliot, and Kirkland!
Today, students can pick up the goods that they purchased from Costco Wholesalers through "Market Day," a program run by Harvard Student Agencies that let's students buy items online and have them delivered to their Houses once a month.
Who wouldn't want a 3-lb. bag of pistachios ($15.75)? Or maybe 22 cans of V-8 Vegetable Juice ($22.49) sound more appealing? You can even buy 36 AA Duracell batteries ($15.75) if you've got some 20 electrical appliances to run in your dorm room.
You see, Costco operates under this simple principle: the more, the better. So if you're looking to stock up on food for the looming exam season, you can buy bulk through Market Day.
Students who purchased their goods through these Houses can pick them up today at:
Happy food-caching!

Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren took time away from trying to save the U.S. economy earlier this week to sit down with Daily Show anchor Jon Stewart
As chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Warren pretty much supervises the bailout.
But near the beginning of the interview, Warren told Stewart that there was "a little dispute on some of the numbers" as to how much money has gone out the doors of the Treasury Department as part of the bailout. Turns out we're down a lot of money and she doesn't know exactly how much.
"Do they have Excel?" Stewart asked.
More witty banter after the jump.
When Stewart asked Warren what she does to monitor the distribution of billions of dollars in government money, she said she, "stands on the outside and asks for more transparency and clarity." Hmm... sounds like what most students want from the Ad Board. Maybe she'll be successful.
Then Warren launched into an explanation of a lot of things Ec concentrators probably understand. FlyBy started paying attention again when she mentioned PPIP (sounds like pee-pip), an acronym she had a bit of trouble pronouncing. Oh, and she couldn't remember what it meant. "It's an investment thing," she says. But then she remembers—"Public-private investment program"—eh, not as exciting as PPIP.
Before her time was up, Warren gave Stewart a brief history lesson about the financial panics the U.S. endured about every 10 to 15 years until the Great Depression hit. She said that the regulation after the Great Depression was what kept the economy stable for so long, but since the govenment has started cutting back on regulations, the country is again been ravaged by financial programs.
She suggested that the govenment quickly needs to decide to ensure there are strong regulations protecting the financial sector.
"And that," Stewart said, "is socialism."
Check out the whole interview here.
