After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The motivation behind Women’s Week has always baffled me, but I took direct offense at the insinuations of a recent op-ed on the subject. Shauna Shames ’01 claims that Women’s Week “helps women to feel like they are equal citizens of this college.” Pardon? I am an equal citizen, and I need no assistance in being made to “feel like” one. In fact, that statement, along with the article’s emphasis on “women’s issues,” made me feel less equal than any other comment has in my time at Harvard.
True equality demands treatment as an ordinary member of society, yet the entire purpose of Women’s Week is to promote women as a special interest group. The very notion of a certain status or identity that unites all Harvard women emphasizes gender division, while women who largely define themselves according to their gender detract from the notion of equal status. Far from erasing gender barriers, the Women’s Week principle of targeting women as a separate and distinct group merely propagates gender inequality.
As far as “female empowerment” is concerned, excessive focus on the “female” has a detrimental impact on “empowerment.” Empowerment demands success regardless of gender and has been achieved by many women at Harvard. None of my Harvard experiences has indicated the gender gap in leadership positions that the forthcoming Women’s Center report promises to show, as women hold top spots in every one of my extracurricular activities. Indeed, both the UC president and vice president are currently women, as is the president of Harvard. But these women have been elected due to their abilities, not their gender.
Gender equality demands that women should not be defined by their sexuality, but by their characteristics and achievements. Harvard women have accomplished much in a wide range of non-gender related roles, and Women Week’s attempt to reduce these achievements to “women’s issues” frankly detracts from their status as equal citizens. While female-focused activities are not necessarily a bad thing—organizations such as Women in Business and the Circle of Women, for example, enable real impact—Women’s Week seems to solely focus on  allowing women to wallow in their sexuality.
The need for a Women’s Week is further diminished by the lack of issues that unify all women at Harvard. Such lack of cohesion is demonstrated by Women’s Week’s effort to link disparate topics  such as “strength training” and “women in music.” Indeed, the one issue that truly unites Harvard women is the inherent sexism in the college’s social scene, yet this matter is given no attention during the week’s programs. The dearth of concerns that unify Harvard’s women suggests that there is no need for us to be upheld or treated as a special interest group and that doing so is more likely to create women’s issues than solve them.
Women at Harvard share two defining characteristics: their sexuality and their choice of college. To emphasize “woman” over “Harvard student” brings women further from equal status, not closer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago, on the Thursday before spring break, the College announced that it would suspend its transfer admissions program. The 1,308 applications vying for an estimated 40 spots were returned uninspected. The student body briefly broke out in protest over the move to eliminate the program, which had allowed approximately 20 students per semester last year and greater numbers in the preceding years, to join the Harvard community. In the short time since the program’s suspension, the outrage over this substantial loss has all too quickly evaporated. With most of the remaining transfers graduating this year and the rest slated to graduate in 2010, the entire institutional memory of the program will soon be lost. A small but important portion of our population will be forgotten.
The transfer admission program has been an important part of the College’s history, allowing notable graduates like John F. Kennedy ’40, Henry Kissinger ’50, and W.E.B. DuBois, Class of 1890, to attend Harvard after doing time at other institutions. The talented pool of transfers that Harvard would admit had already proven themselves exceedingly capable elsewhere before recognizing that they would be best able to learn and contribute here. Yet, despite the March 2007 statement by then-Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 that we “always want to have space for some exceptional transfer students,” this option has been closed indefinitely.
Transfer students have brought to the student body a special kind of the diversity that Harvard prizes. In addition to simply generating exceptional candidates who belonged at Harvard, transfer admissions also brought in students from very distinct institutions. Deep Springs, a two-year, all-male college and ranch in the California desert, is considered one of the most selective and intellectually engaged undergraduate institutions in the country. Formerly, significant numbers of its graduates finished their undergraduate careers at Harvard. Moreover, typical transfer classes included students from all of the military academies who had distinguished themselves in particularly difficult environments and then realized that Harvard, not the military, would provide them with the best chance to give back to their communities and their country. These students, with their highly diverse perspectives, have been locked out.
Although the suspension, as originally announced, was intended to last for only two years until the housing crisis—the supposed reason for the halt—was fixed, the College has since changed its position and “suspended indefinitely” the program. The admissions website now states that, “Instead, the College has embarked on a planning process for substantial capital investment to renovate and revitalize its residential spaces.” It is deeply troubling that the College has reneged on its promise to bring back the transfer program and has no real plan to do so.
The financial situation should not be cause for objection to the reinstatement of the transfer program. New transfer students will pay tuition while adding a very limited marginal cost to the College’s budget, requiring no new professors and being placed into existing advising programs. Although the addition of a few transfer students might require better selectivity in freshman admissions or a slightly greater burden on the House system, the benefits that they bring to the community far outweigh the costs. Harvard must reopen the option of accepting gifted transfer students, whether one, five, 20, or more. Divided among 12 Houses, the burden would be so small, and the gain so great, that the continuation of the suspension is a detriment to the College.

Everyone knows that most upperclass Houses show about as much spirit as the average Harvard cheerleader (that is, aside from the strange creatures that run Mather and Currier HoCo). Ever since the College instituted randomization and Houses lost all semblances of unity and character, cheering on a regular basis for your randomly selected, heterogeneous sample of the Harvard population has been less than appealing. But there is one time of year that’s an exception to this rule, and that’s Housing Day (and Eve). We are thrilled to announce that University Hall has finally realized this and decided to implement a new system modeled on River Run festivities: Instead of being lotteried into their Houses-to-be, freshman blocking groups will now compete in a race to the House (and room) of their choice! 
With the fate of our freshmen now hanging on athletic and strategic prowess, we here at The Crimson compiled a list of suggestions to ensure that our readers dominate this new—and promising—high stakes Race to the River.
First off, take heed when choosing your blocking group. Think you want to live with your freshman roommate or that nice gal you met on FOP? Think again. We’ve heard that the Harvard track team really knows how to run.
The night of River Run usually involves large-scale consumption of alcohol. We recommend that you use this to your advantage. Offer drinks to your frenemies in other blocking groups, ensuring that when the race begins, all they can do is stumble (and maybe puke behind Grays).
Strategically plan your route beforehand. Consider bypassing the mob on the steps outside of Adams and making a beeline for Kirkland instead. If you know you can’t run, maybe choose Leverett just to be safe. Hey, it’s better than the Quad.
Rumor has it that tunnels exist below Harvard Square, connecting each House in a large web-like maze. Acquire access to these tunnels. It will be like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, except without the basilisk (just beware of giant cockroaches).
For the ruthless among you, plan on playing tough. Dickson Brothers has a whole lot of tacks, and if you sprinkle them behind you as you run down Plympton St., you’ll have a clear shot at Quincy.
If you’re not that into competition and don’t mind taking the easy way out (hey there, legacies!), why not just rent a ZipCar? But be careful—we’ve heard there might be tacks on Plympton!
Aim for Lampoon Castle. Word has it that if you scale the side and steal the ibis on top, the River Gods will speed you along to the House of your choice.
We commend the College for what promises to be a new era in Harvard history, filled with the true spirit that comes from earning your place in a House community. Likewise, we expect to see a new generation of fitter, more attractive underclassmen, who will have no choice but to lose the Freshman 15 as they train (hard-core) to race on that fateful Housing Day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, following a graffiti-themed party at Lowell Grille, students in the Chinese Students Association found racist remarks including “Chinese people perform genocide” and “Chinese people suck” scrawled on the walls. Responding in outrage, several Asian-associated student organizations—including the Asian American Brotherhood, Chinese Student Association, Harvard Vietnamese Association, Asian American Association, Half-Asian People’s Association, Harvard Philippine Forum, and Korean Student Association—united to organize a rally that took place yesterday decrying this act of racism.
Though I am proud to be Chinese, I fundamentally disagree with the way in which these organizations responded to the messages left at the party. The rally was a symbolic and reactionary gesture that did not begin to address the underlying, Harvard-specific issues that may have incited these incendiary comments in the first place. Though it may have raised some awareness about issues of discrimination and intolerance, the blanket statement it issued against racism was so uncontroversial as to be ineffectual—in the end, the rally was just action for action’s sake.
It’s a shame that the Asian-American response was not more substantial, for anti-Asian racism is a real problem that deserves serious discussion. Subtle racism is particularly pervasive in the American media; the reporting on Chinese affairs in the New York Times, for instance, is not so different in spirit from the comments left on the Lowell walls. Take for example, a recent New York Times article on the “50th Anniversary of Democratic Reforms in Tibet,” which has a headline reading, “Tibet Atrocities Dot Official Chinese History.” The first line of the article succinctly sums up hundreds of years of history with one line of anti-Chinese rhetoric: “Gone from Tibet are the shackled slaves, the thumbscrews and the scorpion pits that awaited serfs who defied their masters.”
The words at the graffiti party expressed similar sentiments, but they were especially hurtful due to their simplicity. They took misconceptions and stereotypes like those of the New York Times and boiled them down to their most black and white expression. The starkness of those messages that “Chinese people suck” and “Chinese people perform genocides”—their immediacy and lack of any attempt at explanation or qualification—are what we find so provocative.
In that sense, then, perhaps the slurs were a mixed blessing—though they were hurtful, hate-laden, and extremely inappropriate, they spurred us into action. This is not the first time we have heard slighting remarks about the Asian population, but, now that they are appearing on our own walls, we cannot ignore them as we do when we see them in our newspapers. It is unfortunate that we need to wait for the writing on the wall to be motivated into action, but at least a moment for awareness has now come.
Real change, however, won’t come through a rally alone. Rather, we need student organizations on campus to teach us the unique aspects of each culture so that we can have the tools to deal with the discrimination. Cultural events like Eastbound do more to combat intolerance than a weeklong rally, because instead of preaching to us about a pervasive problem, they inspire us to find common ground and appreciate diversity.
The rally was a good opportunity for students and student leaders to unite. Now comes the time for the real efforts in fighting discrimination to begin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jingoism is in the air. You can smell it in the halls of Congress, where pandering politicians wax patriotic while inserting protectionist measures into recovery legislation. But you can also find it wafting from the eggplant parmesan in Harvard’s dining halls, which have adopted a rash of interhouse restrictions that make things dicey for those not lucky enough to sport an Adams sticker on their ID cards. 
The economic nationalism plaguing Washington requires more than House masters to stop. But the gustatory nationalism sweeping Cambridge is within our control, and maybe the time has come to reconsider the way we regulate student meals. 
Restrictions on interhouse dining are widespread and, unsurprisingly, follow a geographical pattern: The far-flung houses—Currier, Cabot, Pforzheimer, Dunster, and Mather—have no regulations at all. Meanwhile, the more conveniently located guard their prime real estate carefully. All require non-residents to come accompanied by a house member for weekday dining. On top of that, Adams, Quincy, and Kirkland have adopted “community nights,” banning outsiders altogether once every week. Combine this with Lowell’s wholesale blockade during opera season, and you have a cumbersome set of barriers standing between students and their chickwiches.
Perhaps more notable than the regulations themselves, though, is the fervor with which they have been enforced this winter. In mid-February, Eliot residents symbolically removed their pants during dinner in a peculiar protest of non-resident diners. And, last Tuesday, Adams resident Vincent M. Chiappini ’09 decided to take matters into his own hands to keep undesirables out of his dining hall. Donning shorts and a T-shirt, Chiappini sat on top of a lifeguard chair and wielded a bullhorn, shouting down interlopers and casting them out into the street. 
When asked about his antics, Chiapinni explained to me that “It’s really a question of capitalism. Some win, some lose.” But, like the pleas of inefficient industries looking to the government for protection from foreign competition, his logic is flawed. The current system does not, in any way, resemble capitalism. In fact, it represents a kind of blind socialism in which a central planner distributes resources with no consideration for efficiency or equity and then walks away. 
This arrangement manages to combine the inefficiency of state direction with the unequal distribution of the free market. Under HUDS-ism, students have no control over where they are allowed to eat, so Quadlings who spend long nights working at The Crimson or Matherites returning from rowing practice just as dining halls are closing find themselves out to dry. The system is also not, in any meaningful sense, “fair.” The common assumption that house residents have a right to eat in their dining halls unhindered by overcrowding stands on shaky foundations—what did any of us do to merit such treatment?
As an Adams resident, I enjoy privileged access to one of the most convenient dining halls on campus, but I owe my providence to nothing more than the random output of the computer program that sorted my blocking group. I won the housing lottery, but I just as easily could have lost. Behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance, I know that I would not want to run the risk of not only being forced to live in the Quad, but also having to eat there.
So here’s a proposal for dining hall restrictions whose effectiveness is belied by its simplicity: There should be no restrictions of any kind. Any upperclass student should be allowed to eat in any dining hall at any time. Resources for food and staff should be allocated by HUDS in proportion to mealtime swipes to ensure that there are enough supplies and service at each location. Some of the more popular locales will no doubt be plagued by overcrowding, but this is a sacrifice that I—and that I think we all, behind the veil of ignorance—would be willing to make. Moreover, the problem should, to some extent, take care of itself as students with greater flexibility decide to relocate to less popular dining halls in order to avoid the rush. 
 In the long term, with House renovations on the horizon, overcrowding could be more thoroughly addressed by expanding the most conveniently located dining halls. Adams House master Sean Palfrey, for example, has long campaigned for the administration to add a second floor to his dining hall. If he ever gets his wish, then dining hall lifeguards will become a thing of the past.
In the meantime, though, it’s time for Cambridge to internalize the lesson that Washington should have learned back in 1930, when the restrictive Smoot-Hawley Tariff helped plunge the United States into the Great Depression: Protectionism may be intuitively appealing and politically convenient, but it’s a one-way street to nowhere.
To paraphrase a Harvard grad: There is not an Eliot College and a Lowell College and a Kirkland College and a Cabot College—there’s Harvard College. While I may just be a skinny kid with a funny name, that’s some change I can believe in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How is it that, after winning more votes than any presidential candidate before him and having the largest Democratic congressional majorities in a generation (which are even larger when you consider that they do not include the “solid South” conservative Democrats of old), Barack Obama and his administration still lack sufficient votes just to bring urgently necessary—not to mention popular—legislation to a vote? 	
The biggest challenge to effective policy as we attempt to climb our way out of this recession, administer universal health care, reform public education, and push through a climate-change bill is the de facto supermajority requirement for any bill in the Senate. 
So the question poses itself: Do the Democrats take a page from the Republican playbook and threaten to “go nuclear” (as the Republicans threatened in 2005 out of frustration at Democratic cloture holds on conservative judicial nominees)? 
Filibusters, in moderation, are a good way for the minority to prevent or, at the very least, delay the sometimes-overreaching ambitions of the majority. That can be a good thing. Indeed, it is particularly useful in times of crisis and populist hysteria to have a braking mechanism that causes Congress to at least stop and think before it acts.
Still, after 233 years of constitutional development, a supermajority is only required in five cases: to override a presidential veto, to amend the constitution, to pass treaties with foreign nations, to convict impeached public officials, and to expel members of the House or Senate. Nowhere does the Constitution say you need 60 votes just to debate contentious legislation. 
Furthermore, the cloture/filibuster rule is not something enshrined by centuries of observance. The rule, as practiced currently, is a quite recent invention. Prior to the late ’60s, it was primarily used by Southern senators seeking to block civil-rights legislation. Filibusters were not a factor in enacting the legislative agendas of presidents from Roosevelt through Bush Sr. The filibuster has only entered into wide usage in the last 15 years, beginning in Bill Clinton’s first term, when Republicans filibustered 32 times during the 103rd Congress. That number has grown steadily since, thanks to both Republicans and Democrats. The latest Congress filibustered 112 times, 51 of which were successful. The institutionalization of the filibuster is perhaps the premier bipartisan accomplishment of the last two decades, even as it is obviously a product of the hyper-partisanship of this epoch. 
The result is that, today, all it takes is 41 votes to bring legislation you don’t like to a halt, perhaps permanently. This is a maneuver particularly suited to the Republicans’ current strategic weakness and characteristic tactics: Oppose everything, constantly whip up the base, feed a steady, daily diet of red-meat attacks to Fox News, hope that something develops traction and slowly begins to erode Obama’s or the Democrats’ credibility, and, above all, show that Obama and the Democrats are “ineffective.”
Democrats just don’t have the cojones for this level of relentless obstructionism. During the Bush years, Democrats mounted many filibusters, but they were almost entirely with regard to highly partisan judicial appointments. For his major initiatives—No Child Left Behind, prescription drugs, tax cuts, the Iraq and Afghan wars, immigration—Bush received significant Democratic support. Democrats struck a deal about judicial appointments through the “gang of 14,” which smoothed the way for the confirmation of a slew of Bush appointments. There were no serious challenges to the appointments of Supreme Court justices Samuel A. Alito and John G. Roberts ’76, in spite of their manifestly conservative philosophies. 
Yet, when it came to the stimulus package, an urgently necessary and popular measure, it took significant concessions to get three Republicans (all from states where Obama is wildly popular) on board to clear the filibuster, and, aside from them, no Republican even came to the table. This may only be the beginning of a long series of filibusters to Obama initiatives and judicial appointments that continue through the off-year 2010 elections, when the party out of power would ordinarily be expected to win back some seats. Even if Obama’s personal popularity may be hard to overcome, Republicans are hoping for a repeat of the Clinton presidency: a popular president at the mercy of an agenda-setting Congress where the Republicans either dominate or at least hold far greater sway than they do today. 
Changing the rules is a risky proposition. Democrats hold 57, soon to be 58, seats in the Senate, so changing filibuster procedures may turn out to be unnecessary until at least 2010, when the deck will be reshuffled again. Yet, if current trends continue, a point may arrive when some type of adjustment in the rules should at least be threatened, perhaps not by the administration or party leadership, but at least by individual Democratic senators.

Every March, housing day makes or breaks more than a thousand Harvard freshmen as they discover the fate of their next three years. Whether they tear open their envelopes and cheer over getting Adams, or cry when they find they’ll actually have to come to the Quad sober, there’s one thing every incoming sophomore should be acquainted with: their house’s party suite. FM has compiled a list of the best and the brightest in each house for your convenience. While any of Mather’s low-rise suites could host a good party, none of them stand out from the pack. Leverett is also excluded from this list because Harvard’s biggest house is all about quantity, not quality.Quincy: The Balcony SuiteTake the elevator in New Quincy to the third floor, where you’ll find the one balcony suite in Quincy that isn’t taken up by tutors. Currently home to eight senior athletes, the beirut table may not stay next year, but the infamous terrace definitely will.  “The terrace, with a fantastic view of the courtyard, is great in the fall and the spring, where people come and play games or just hang out and drink, “ describes rower Edward W. “Teddy” Schreck ’09. This suite, which is actually made up of two regular Quincy duplex suites, has eight spacious singles, two common rooms, and two bathrooms.  With a built-in bar and fairly sound-proof walls, this tri-level is definitely one of the best suites on campus.Currier: The Ten ManWhat more could you ask for than a personal elevator that opens up directly in the middle of your common room? This ten-bedroom suite on the second floor of A-entryway serves as Heaven in Currier’s annual Heaven and Hell party. The massive common room comfortably houses various couches, a beirut table, a large screen TV and still has plenty of room for the drunken masses. Although the ten single bedrooms aren’t as large as other Currier singles, the mere fact that this suite is the only one on campus with its own elevator and staircase places it near the top of our list—but it’s still in the Quad.Winthrop: ‘The Palatial Penthouse Palace’The fifth floor of Winthrop’s C-entryway boasts this mammoth suite, home to seven seniors each year. With fantastically insulated walls and prime views of the courtyard on one side and the Charles River on the other, the suite’s long hallways host everything from dance parties to beer bottle bowling. Switzerland native Alexandre N. Maurice ’09 says that he turned the giant common room this year into a “European discotheque, equipped with an excellent sound system whose speakers have been known to blow out on occasion.”Pforzheimer: The Bell TowerRight beneath Pfoho’s belltower sits this four-bedroom suite. It technically has four residents, but it also connects to two other four-person duplexes which, when hosting a blocking group of 12, makes it the largest party suite on campus. Slanted skylights grace the ceiling of the giant common room with its built-in bar. “Our space is great because it’s more intimate than massive dining hall parties and more welcoming than the final clubs,” says resident Krista E. Weiss ’09. “We throw frequent parties and everyone is invited.”Eliot: The CockpitCurrently, this co-ed suite on the fifth floor of Eliot’s C-entryway houses 10 people, and is located just a floor above another notorious Eliot party suite, the fourth floor’s “Ground Zero.” “Since we’re right above Ground Zero, which itself is on top of the Eliot Library, we never get noise complaints,” says current resident Eva L. Mihalis ’09. The giant common room with views of the courtyard fits comfortably in the middle of the suite, which has two wings, connected by two bathrooms. Lowell: The Labyrinth“It’s called the labyrinth because when there’s a party and it’s dark and you’re a little out of it, all the winding halls and bedrooms can be a bit confusing,” says current resident and former Crimson Associate Business Manager Tyler W. Bosmeny ’09. The suite is made up of three rooms all connected by fire doors, creating haphazardly placed hallways that run through this eight-bedroom senior suite. However, with its fourth floor D-entryway location, views of the courtyard, large common room and two master bedrooms, the Labyrinth nabs our pick for Lowell house’s best party suite.Dunster: ‘The G-Spot’Although Dunster house is infamous for walk-through bedrooms, this 10-person suite occupying the entire fifth floor of G-entryway is home to a set of spacious non-walk-through singles. “Both last year and this year, the suite has been home to nine guys and one girl,” says current resident Katharine T. Waterman, Jr. ’09. Since the common room looks over Cowperthwaite Street, non-registered parties are tough to conceal. If your blocking group is looking for a party suite with some privacy, we recommend buddying up to your housemasters now.Kirkland: ‘The Swamp’This maze of a suite on the second floor of I-entryway has eight connecting rooms, with three common rooms and five bedrooms. “This year we’ve kind of been known for the ‘smash-up/mash-up’ parties we’ve hosted, where we play a lot of mash-ups of music,” says James A. Fish ’10. Shaped like the letter C, the suite is mostly comprised of walk-throughs, but the view of the MAC quad and homey feel of the suite make it ideal for both comfortable living and partying alike. One of the bedroom windows even opens out onto the roof of the dining hall, where you can go out and tan or just bask on a sunny day.Cabot: The Library SuiteNothing says Ivy League academia like turning an old library into a student residence. This suite sits on the third floor of Cabot’s secluded B-entryway and is among the smaller suites on the list, typically housing five students every year. The ample common room has old, mahogany bookshelves filled with various books collected over the years, a fireplace, window seats, and a beautiful view of the Quad yard. With five singles and a bathroom, this is the perfect suite for the smaller blocking group that loves both books and booze.Adams: ‘Heaven’Every year, the five residents of Adams A-47 turn their room into Heaven as part of the annual Adams Heaven and Hell party. Four bedrooms, one of which is a double, surround the 400 square foot common room. The spacious bedrooms make up for the suite’s smaller size.  This year’s inhabitants love the suite so much that they are hesitant to welcome newbies. “We might let the bar stay if next year’s residents give us a good offer.” says Nicholas K. Tabor ’09, a current resident and former Crimson editor.

It was nearing 2 a.m. last night and Lamont Café, the social headquarters of the freshman class, was abuzz with angst. As I sauntered over to the barista to grab a study break snack, I couldn’t help but notice feisty premeds pounding numbers into past problem-sets to prepare for their last mid-term exams. Wannabe MBAs were schmoozing in the basement, and on the steps outside, anyone too alt to function was smoking American Spirits and counting down to spring break. But if there was one thing in the back of every freshman mind in Lamont last night, it was that in a few wee hours, Housing Day would soon be upon them. It might seem inconvenient that the big day falls in the midst of mid-terms. For some, Housing Day is nothing but the unsolvable end sum of a complex mathematical algorithm by which they will be assigned a place of living. And for others, it’s just an annoyance; a lack of perfect information in Harvard’s centrally planned real estate market. But for one subset of the freshman class, Housing Day is the culmination of an intensive, nearly year-long study of Harvard’s winding social staircase. For these climbers, today is one of the most crucial exams of a Harvard career—and there’s no curve. Alexander F. Carmichaels III ’12, for instance, had been studying for this trial since just after Thanksgiving break. I spotted the Jersey-native sipping a latte near the magazine racks in the café, surrounded by a cadre of 2012’s most well heeled aspiring final clubbers. But rumor has it he hadn’t always been in such bourgeois company. “I hear he only wore Knicks jerseys at the beginning of the year,” one girl whispered near the vending machines. “And like, they don’t even like him, he just got a fake in the City and they use him to buy alcohol,” another responded. “Yea, well I know for a fact that both the ‘III’ at the end of his name and his Prada loafers are completely bootleg,” sneered the first girl.Illegitimately outfitted or not, it was undeniable that Carmichaels had made himself just tolerable enough to sit on the periphery of first-year aristocracy. He hoped tomorrow would move him closer to his ultimate goal. He would be practically legally bound to bunk with these Eton elites and Cantabrigian Brahmins he’d studied so well.  “Nah she’s fat,” I heard one of the Brahmins say to the others as he moved on to a different Facebook profile. “Wait go back, Stefan. Look at her profile pictures,” another pleaded. “So do you think she’d still hook up with you after last weekend,” yet another chimed in with a British accent to an uproarious laughter from the group. “Do you fellas think we should get going?” Carmichaels said to no response. “We should get going on this River Run thing, right?” The others acted as if they couldn’t hear him, and sat transfixed in front of the computer screen. It was as if they were playing a high-stakes game in which the first to respond to [the semi-outsider lost social clout].  A few minutes later they responded. Not to Carmichaels, but to a vibrating iPhone.“Dude let’s go to Drake’s club. He said we could hang out with the guys,” the British one said, excited. The group picked up their monogrammed L.L. Bean backpacks and headed towards Winthrop, Carmichaels scurrying along after them. As I settled into a carrel a few floors above the café, ready to study for an important midterm of my own, I couldn’t help but overhear Carmichaels’ raucous roommate, Ken G. Singer ’12, whispering just a bit too loudly.  “He loves using StickyNotes on his Mac,” I heard Singer say to a study-buddy in a hushed tone, “once, I was looking for a song on his computer and just happened to see a whole bunch of them stuck to the desktop of his computer.” “I mean, that’s not that weird,” I heard in response, “I use them all the time to remind myself to finish my homework and stuff.” “Yea but do you use them to remind yourself to schedule a ‘luncheon’ with someone from the A.D.? Or to have dinner with a Delphic member? These weren’t just to-do lists I’m talking about, Alana. These were plans of social action more intricate than the Stimulus Package.” As daybreak approached, I left Lamont. Heading down Mount Auburn Street back to Winthrop, I couldn’t help but see the outline of a boy knocking on the door of the Phoenix. As I moved closer, the pounding grew louder and more desperate, echoing in the empty streets.  “Yo guys,” I heard Carmichaels’ voice, “guys. Let me in.” But there was no response. All I could hear as I passed the brick building was the inorganic crunching of numbers into Carmichaels’ recently purchased BlackBerry Storm.

Although Lil Wayne’s “Lollipop” is certainly a crowd pleaser, it may not capture hip-hop’s original spirit of activism, according to the Harvard’s Hiphop Archive founder and Executive Director, Marcyliena Morgan.“You get [radio stations saying] ‘let’s play these songs about someone’s butt,’” said Morgan, a professor of African and African American Studies.To exchange ideas and promote dialogue surrounding issues of global hip-hop, the Hiphop Archive hosted a conference this week entitled “Hiphop Worldwide: More than a Nation,” which brought together hip-hop artists, scholars, DJs, and authors. Founded in 2002, the mission of the Hiphop Archive is to gather resources for the research of the past and present of hip-hop culture. “The Archive opens up the doors to the idea that hip-hop is a respectable and important academic field,” said Akshata Kadagathur ’11, an intern at the Archive. “It’s a great resource, especially on a campus where hip-hop doesn’t have a very big venue.”Courtney E. Rose, a graduate student of Professor Morgan, agreed that hip-hop does not have a strong presence at Harvard, but noted, “I think hip-hop is getting a stronger voice here at Harvard because of people like Marcy Morgan, and this week is part of that.”Running from March 10-13, the conference featured a lecture by rapper and activist, Chuck D. of Public Enemy, who discussed how loving hip-hop is about knowing the facts behind the music. The thirst to learn these facts and to share knowledge, according to Morgan, is part of hip-hop’s motivation, which facilitates the exchange of ideas on both a local and global scale. “Hip-hop is an ideal place to start thinking, making sure we are socially responsible,” said Morgan. “It’s just about the everyday, and the beauty of the everyday, the frustration and hope of the everyday.”Word.

Harvard’s Faculty Room is often cited as one of the most impressive spaces on campus, and it is easy to see why. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, light shines in through the windows, and the busts and portraits of Harvard legends line the walls. Located on the second floor of University Hall, the room has been renovated to look identical to the way it was 100 years ago, when former University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, presided over Faculty meetings. English Professor Louis Menand recalled feeling thrilled when the Harvard Faculty finally approved the new curriculum at the last Faculty meeting of the 2006-2007 academic year. Menand, who helped author the Report of the Task Force on General Education, said that almost the entire room—168 professors, to be exact—raised their hands as the Secretary of the Faculty counted the votes. At that meeting, the Faculty moved to eliminate the nearly 30-year-old Core program and implement the new Gen Ed curriculum over a period of two years. Now—nearly two years later—Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris leans back in his chair and crosses his arms. His sparsely decorated office marks a striking contrast to the Faculty Room just a floor above. The walls are bare. As I interview him, my eyes fall upon Eliot’s Harvard Classics series on a small gray bookshelf nearby, their gold letters glittering against the red binding. On an adjacent bookshelf I see “General Education in a Free Society”—more commonly known as the Red Book, Harvard’s famous 1945 treatise that changed the face of American education. I point to the books. When I mention the Harvard Classics to Harris, he emphasizes that the names of many of these authors no longer ring a bell. Tastes change. So do curricula. And so do the people in charge of implementing academic programs. HARRIS AT THE HELM In the summer 2007, Harris was appointed chair of the newly formed Standing Committee on General Education. Already chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and instructor of a popular Core course, Moral Reasoning 54: “If There is No God, All Is Permitted,” Harris had a significant stake in the trajectory of General Education. The Gen Ed committee is responsible for soliciting and approving prosposals for new courses and departmental alternatives. And, as chair of the committee, Harris was charged with translating the ideals of the final report into a workable curriculum. As Faculty enthusiasm remains low and Harvard’s resources diminish, the fall 2009 launch date looms. The Gen Ed program now appears more difficult to implement than the Faculty may have anticipated. CURRICULA: A REVIEW Harvard is known as a college that holds fast to its traditions. When the Harvard Corporation voted to change the calendar in 2007—after significant pressure from the Undergraduate Council—it was only the second time in Harvard’s 373-year history that the University had done so. The last time that the calendar had changed was in 1838. But occasionally, there are those titans who do away with tradition and help shape history. One of Harvard’s greatest figures was President Eliot, who governed the University from 1869 to 1909. He expanded the student body and eliminated the College’s fixed curriculum of Latin, Greek, logic, and other prescribed subjects, replacing it with a free-for-all elective system. Of academic subjects, he said, “We would have them all, and at their best.” The president who succeeded Eliot—Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877—moved away from Eliot’s elective system, instead requiring students to declare concentrations. In the search for order, Lowell turned to specialization—not general education. It was not until World War II that Harvard established a general education curriculum. University President James B. Conant ’14 vested then-Dean of the Faculty Paul H. Buck with an epic task: to chair a committee that would reevaluate secondary and higher American education. The new initiative involved promoting and preserving democratic ideals. The resulting manifesto, the Red Book, not only proposed an answer for how to mold students into educated citizens, but also how to mold a more cohesive world community. Thousands of copies were disseminated across the United States, and the nation noticed. It took several years, however, for the grand treatise to be implemented at Harvard—in the form of Harvard’s first General Education program. But when it did make it into the course catalogs, its introductory lower-level courses excited many. History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 recalled taking Social Sciences 2: “Western Thought and Institutions”—a kind of predecessor to Social Studies 10: “Introduction to Social Studies,” which required readings like Weber and Rousseau. While at first, Gen Ed’s required lower-level classes in the Humanities and Social Sciences, such as Social Sciences 2, would cover a broad array of thought—like the definition of love by different philosophers—they eventually devolved into more specialized classes, like Humanities 25: “Civilization of Continental and Island Portugal.” Gen Ed’s middle-level courses—which could be replaced with two departmental alternatives for each slot—were even more specialized. After almost 25 years, then-Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky called for a reevaluation of the current system. After much debate, the Faculty moved to eliminate the first Gen Ed program and establish the Core. While the first Gen Ed focused on categories of thought, the Core asked students to think strictly within a discipline. Many Harvard professors said that college curricula need renewal every generation. Menand explained that over time, as small modifications accumulate, the Faculty loses track of the overall objectives of the curriculum. That is when it is time to begin anew. So, about a quarter-century later, University President Lawrence H. Summers decided it was time to evaluate the curriculum again. As specialized courses infiltrated the Core Curriculum, the program became more difficult to define. The Faculty then decided to return to the interdisciplinary study that the first Gen Ed program espoused. “The Red Book defined Harvard to the whole country for a period of 20 years,” said former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who graduated under the first Gen Ed curriculum. “The Harvard Faculty actually thought they were doing something important for the world by teaching these kinds of courses. There’s nothing in the air of that kind now.” As the Gen Ed committee searches for new classes to incorporate into its program next year, professors worry that loopholes in the new curriculum’s structure may allow for specialized courses that deviate from the ideal of a general education. “The structure is the same, of course,” said Gross, “because institutions are comfortable with what they’re used to.” THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT SUMMERS Professors say that when then-University President Summers officially launched the curricular review in 2002, he aspired to leave his mark on Harvard. “He wanted something that would be a legacy for him...that would really look like he had put his stamp on it,” said former Government Professor Lisa L. Martin, who worked with Summers on the original Curricular Review Steering Committee in 2003-2004 and now teaches at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. “I think that was really important to him.” But according to some professors, that ambition may have undermined his ability to work with others. Maier, who also served on the committee, said that Summers did not realize that regularly voicing his own opinions was stifling the discussion. “When the president intervenes in something like this, he comes with more than his voice,” Maier said. “He comes with his office.” A tug-of-war ensued, between Summers, then-Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby, and then-Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross, and amongst the members of the committee. Professors said that even toward the beginning, the curricular review was slowed by a lack of compromise, as professors wanted to make sure that there was a place for them. “Whenever we’d propose a program, they’d say, ‘Where’s my course?’” Gross said. Philosophy Professor Alison Simmons, who co-chaired the later committee that produced the final Gen Ed legislation, agreed. “Nobody was in charge of the discussion,” she said. “It was like a section that’s a free-for-all.” Between 2004 and 2006, with 12 other committees exploring different areas of the undergraduate experience, and no one clearly in charge of the main Gen Ed committee, progress was slow. In January 2006, the committee finally agreed on a distribution requirement that would include all classes in the FAS course catalog, Simmons said, because it was simply the only thing they could agree on: a “common denominator.” “It seemed the least aggressive,” Simmons said. “It seemed it would make the most people happy—or at least the fewest people unhappy.” But not everyone would be pleased with the compromise. BOK IS BACK In March 2006, incoming interim University President Derek C. Bok called together a group of around ten professors from the Committee on General Education, including the future architects of the new General Education program—Menand and Simmons. These professors sat in a Loeb House conference room, where the Harvard Corporation meets to decide the direction of the University. After Summers and Kirby resigned, one right after the other, Bok thought it was time to reevaluate the direction of the curricular review. “He yelled at us,” Menand said. “He felt that we could do better, and this was not up to Harvard’s standards.” Bok said in a recent phone interview that when he took over, he feared that the curricular review might die. It was of the utmost importance to sustain the committee’s momentum. Until then, a 26-member Gen Ed committee had taken three years to produce their proposal—one, professors say, that did not excite much of the Faculty. Bok wanted to start over. He appointed a more manageable nine-person committee who started from scratch. With that goal in mind, the new Task Force—co-chaired by Menand and Simmons—produced a piece of legislation that met Bok’s expectations. After releasing their initial report in October 2006, they visited departments to discuss the proposal and then released a revised report in February 2007 to be reviewed by the full Faculty. Participants at those Faculty meetings agree that the next four months were characterized by turf battles—professors jockeying to make sure that their discipline would find its place in Gen Ed. “It’s a herding cats kind of operation in FAS,” Menand said. “The Faculty is filled with people who are accustomed to doing their own thing.” According to Menand, he and the rest of the Task Force decided to withdraw from the discussion at that point, since they wanted the Faculty to feel as though the curriculum was theirs. Lewis said that, as temporary leaders, Bok and interim Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles were unwilling to substantially shape the discussions. “This curriculum happened through a democratic process, but it’s the kind of democracy you’d have in Congress if neither the President nor the party leadership was around,” Lewis said. The Faculty revised the legislation line by line during meetings. Even so, not all Faculty members felt as though they had the chance to make the curriculum their own. “[The legislation] was really this sort of thing that we were given that we had to modify,” said Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor David A. Haig, who added he would have preferred to see a distribution requirement. “I thought there was never any real serious bit of philosophical discussions of the pros and cons of different forms of general education.” But if there was anyone to make sure that the review kept going, it was Bok. Since Bok had decided to take on the presidency for a second time without being paid, and he himself had overseen the creation of the Core Curriculum, his determination to finish the curricular review was “this sort of heroic thing,” according to Menand. If Bok wanted Gen Ed passed by the end of his term as president, it was going to get passed. GEN ED FOR DUMMIES What is Gen Ed? For some students, the answer to this question remains unclear. The only reference to Gen Ed Elizabeth R. Holly ’12 could remember happened during freshman week. Her academic adviser did not know much about the new program either, though she assured Holly that more information would come. Six months later, according to Holly, that information has yet to arrive. Unlike the Core, Gen Ed does not exempt students from any of its categories. All Harvard students, starting with the class of 2013, must take courses in all eight categories: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and the United States in the World. Back in his office, Harris describes the philosophy behind the Gen Ed program. “Students really need to be able to situate themselves in traditions of culture, evaluate data-driven claims, display scientific literacy, engage the world ethically,” he says. What will set this curriculum apart from previous ones may be the extent to which Gen Ed courses tie the subject matter to students’ lives outside of the classroom. Harris adds that Gen Ed aims “to connect what students learn to their lives outside of college, most emphatically not in the vocational sense.” The curricular review, however, set out to change more than just the curriculum. The Faculty also approved the creation of secondary fields, expanded the Advising and Freshman Seminar Programs, and transformed study abroad from a taboo practice to a full-fledged program that is common, encouraged, and well funded. STUDENTS’ SAY Many students at Harvard seem to prefer a distribution requirement, which would provide students with more freedom in their course selection. “As soon as you allocate Core classes, everyone’s just going to look for the easiest one,” said William A. Scott ’10, an Engineering concentrator in Leverett House. Joan Xu ’11 said that she sees a distribution requirement as an opportunity to avoid the “fake [Quantitative Reasoning] courses that professors don’t take seriously and students know are there just to fulfill a requirement.” In their own way, the new Gen Ed categories are broad enough to give professors the leeway to teach the subject matter they want. But with a limited selection of departmental alternatives, student choice may remain narrow. In the meantime, freshmen are relatively uninformed about the change. “I don’t think I’ve received any information on [Gen Ed],” said Charlotte C.L. Chang ’12, a freshman in Greenough Hall. “I think I may have received an e-mail or two about it, but I don’t know what it is.” THE PRESSURE IS ON On paper and in Task Force meetings Menand and Simmons’s legislation seemed like the answer to Bok’s expectations. But now, as Gen Ed’s launch date approaches, translating the ideals of general education into a workable program presents unexpected challenges. As of February 26, 2009, only 81 courses have been approved for Gen Ed credit, and most of them have been carried over as existing department or Core classes. According to Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron, the Economics department, Harvard’s largest, has no plans to develop any new Gen Ed classes. Instead, they are hoping to get two departmental classes approved. This approach is not uncommon across departments. As Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith recently slashed the number of searches for visiting professors and ladder faculty in light of the economic downturn, departments will be hard pressed to support their existing courses next year—let alone create new Gen Ed courses. In the meantime, demand for Gen Ed classes in the next few years is guaranteed to be high. More than 1,600 incoming freshmen will fall under Gen Ed this September, and College administrators say that they expect nearly half of rising sophomores to choose Gen Ed over the Core. Older students are also likely to jockey for newly created Gen Ed classes, since they also count toward the Core. But in spite of increased demand, the Gen Ed committee is finding it difficult to recruit professors to teach within the new program. Some professors have said that they would like to see Faust and Smith taking action to recruit new classes. “It’s important for the deans—especially for Dean Smith and for President Faust—to get out front on this issue and help to beat the drums for it,” Menand said. “Just so people understand what we’re doing and why it’s innovative.” Menand remembered feeling excited when Bok invited 15 professors who helped guide the curricular review to a celebratory dinner in Loeb House. They celebrated the conclusion of the review process in the same building where Bok had chewed them out, a little over a year earlier. A string quartet played music. Menand presented Bok with a shirt that said, “BOK,” on the back and, “168-14-11” on the front—the final vote. But professors now worry about whether Gen Ed will even be ready to launch next fall. “I haven’t given up hope they can launch Gen Ed with a bang,” Simmons said. “I haven’t given up hope. It’s a slightly dimmer hope, but I think it can still happen.” Meanwhile, members of the Gen Ed committee have been working hard to get Gen Ed off the ground. Tomorrow is the official deadline for Gen Ed course offerings to be printed in the 2009-2010 course catalog. The clock is ticking. —Kate A. Borowitz and Noah S. Rayman contributed to the reporting of this story.

by GULUS EMREHe’s a Harvard grad with an M.D., a Master of Philosophy, and a certification in clinical hypnotherapy. But Alex Benzer ’93, author of “The Tao of Dating for Men” and “The Tao of Dating for Women”, just wants to help you find “the middle path.” FM chatted with Benzer about dating, dropping the H-bomb, and picking up the phone for Mom mid-makeout. 1.  Fifteen Minutes: What compelled you to write your books and articles about dating?Alex Benzer: I was a pre-med tutor at Cabot House a few years ago, and I’d sit down with the students, have dinner with them, and one of the favorite topics of conversation was dating, and how little of it happens on the Harvard campus. I had gone and figured out some things and taken some classes and gathered some resources, so I thought “Harvard students, they’re exceptionally good at learning stuff that’s inside books!”  2.  FM: Why do you think that smart people are bad at dating? Shouldn’t we be good at it? We’re good at a lot of things.AB: People in general are not very good at dating because it’s not a skill that’s taught, and very few parents actually spend time on this kind of thing...and yet it’s probably one of the most if not the most important aspects of life—connecting meaningfully to other human beings. 3. FM: What do you think of the college hook-up culture?AB: It’s important to do something and practice something in order to get better at it, and dating is no different. So you have to figure out what your preferences are, you have to figure out what the things are to say and what the behaviors are to really draw people into your life, and then have a basis upon which to make an informed judgment. So the drunken hook-up thing...eh. Perhaps not the best arena for developing that skill. But on the other hand, being a hermit is not the solution either.4.  FM: The common perception is that when females say they go to Harvard, they are written off, whereas men are considered more attractive. In your opinion, why is that?AB: As a man who went to Harvard, I can tell you it didn’t do a hell of a lot for my dating life. Generally, the H-bomb, when it’s dropped, tends to change the interaction in some way. But at the same time, consider it a blessing. If somebody disqualifies himself from the outset based on that, he probably wasn’t going to be a good choice in the first place. If he can’t handle your fabulousness, then phooey on him.  5. FM: Can you rank the Ivies in terms of social awkwardness/inability to date normally?AB: The less other stuff there is to do in town, the more you’re going to just sit around and drink and party, so I’m going to say Princeton probably had more fun than we did, just by virtue of being in Princeton, New Jersey. My impression is that Brown and Dartmouth also have a lot more fun just because it’s kind of the culture they’ve got. Harvard has a particular history of clamping down on anything resembling fun. But it’s gotten a lot better.  6.FM: You were a biology concentrator at Harvard. What was your love life like?AB: My love life as a Harvard student was pretty much non-existent. This is the problem with campuses like Harvard and other very high-achieving, high-strung campuses—it’s that people become devalued. A human being­—a friend, a girlfriend, a boyfriend—is number six or seven on the list of extracurriculars, if that. So if people are reading this, one thing I would encourage them to do is to really value those human connections.  7. FM: How has your Harvardian background helped you in your profession, if at all?AB: That certainly does help. Harvard is a recognized global brand, and a brand means a very small amount of information which stands in for a huge amount of information that is reliable. So all you lucky ducks at Harvard: well played. 8. FM: You were a TF in a chemistry class. How is teaching chemistry like teaching dating?AB: The first step is to reassure the students that “you can do this.” It’s not a big deal and it’s not difficult at all. I mean, let’s face it: if you’re sitting there right now, you are proof-positive that every single one of your ancestors, going back to Australopithecus down to the very first amoeba, they got it on, at least once, successfully, with somebody, so it can’t be that tough. The second step is to make it fun...if you give them strategies to make it fun and interesting such that they look forward to doing it instead of being afraid of doing it, then they’re going to have a lot more success.  9.FM: What is the worst dating advice you have ever heard?AB: This book called “The Rules” for women. Don’t touch it; just burn it. Anything that smacks of an absolute rule is not necessarily bound to serve you. You want to use your own best judgment according to every situation that arises.  The principle is the middle path.  10. FM: Feel free to decline answering this one: Do you have any personal dating horror stories that you would be willing to share?AB: Oh absolutely...this is a piece of advice for the ladies: turn your cell phone off when you’re on a date.  Picking up the phone right in the makeout zone and talking to mom, of all people, is the world’s most potent anti-aphrodisiac. 11. FM: You’re also a hypnotherapist. What led you to pursue that profession?AB: In med school they had a class entitled “Clinical Hypnotherapy,” and being of a scientific bent I thought I’m going to go in there and heckle these cats because this is a whole bunch of nonsense. So I go in there, and just listening to the guy, boom, I’m out in five minutes. So I’m like, okay, something’s up here. So I ended up taking the class. 12. FM: How did your parents react to your switch from medical school to dating?AB: I think my mom’s words were “My life has now ended.” But at the same time, she understands, and my dad has always been understanding.  13. FM: You have a Master of Philosophy from Cambridge. Which Cambridge is better and why?AB: You can’t really do much better than Boston. But Cambridge, England is an amazing place...I always say, Cambridge: surly people, inedible food, crappy weather, best year of my life. 14. FM: What is the most rewarding aspect of helping people with relationships?AB: For me, it’s just the gratification of seeing people apply the knowledge and get results...really, it’s about people getting back their personal power.  15. FM: How can we nerds lead normal love lives and normal lives in general? AB: It’s mostly about courage, just being willing to put yourself out there and try a couple of new things...meet lots of people, hang out with them, go out on dates, go to all the formals, and be willing to extend yourself and put yourself out there and ask people out. In parting words: don’t let the fact that you are smart and accomplished and intelligent become a handicap when it comes to relating to other people. You can learn from anybody. Just realize that the whole purpose of a relationship is for both of you to grow, and that’s possible in many, many contexts.

Freshmen have eagerly examined each of the Houses, particularly while drinking and peeing in their courtyards. Some superstitious first-years even sent flaming boats down the Charles, like that’s some sort of joke. Right, sure, flaming boats are funny. How about, we all remember the MAINE! How quickly we forget. 
Jingoism aside, we do not care to profile the Houses. We are not in the architecture business, and you probably already know that if you get Dunster, you’ll spend the next three years inside an irregular dodecahedron cell in Roger Porter’s attic. [1] We are in the people business. Just ask the dining hall workers to whom we give performance reviews after each brunch. 
Prestige and Mobility still encourage you to rejoice in the rivers of champagne that flow in Adams like the mighty Euphrates and we would not dissuade you from wallowing in self-pity as you walk the trail of tears down Garden Street to the forgotten, volcanic, dinosaur-plagued underworld of Currier. However, as Aristotle once said, “Man is a political animal (as relates to blocking groups and also women).” [2]  
Never inclined to disagree with Aristotle, we, men marked by prestigiosity and a mobilious nature, instead want to offer advice on dealing with your blocking group for the next three years. Find your group and then heed our counsel. 
The Models and Bottles Group: You’ve done it. You’ve gone to parties at the Pudding and not just to steal alcohol and leave. Fat kids you don’t know know you. You were the first kid in your class to make your Facebook profile private. By blocking with the other freshmen who prefer status to human beings, you have guaranteed yourself three years of final club punches, beautiful people, and raging parties. In reality, your ambitions will lead you to civil war. The best House for this group is Cabot. You could use the humility. 
The Henry Clay Memorial Great Compromise Group: This is a group that no one is happy with. It likely emerged in the eleventh hour from as many as eight different groups. All are wary of each other and just looking for any way out. It’s like getting married after forty. Because you understand the pain of treachery from blocking, you should all be kind during rooming. Yet as the political animal you are (see above), you will still Machiavelli your way your way into a triple with the other two non-Asians. The best house for you is Leverett, a symbol of the blah lack of distinction you embody. 
The We-Only-Do-One-Thing Group: You spend all your time together, so why not spend ALL your time together? Whether in the IOP Forum, the concert halls, or anime dungeons, these people are like family. Imagine a room in which every one was in your a capella group. Life really could be a musical! No a ca-politics in that utopia! What if you blocked with all your friends from Harvard Dems? Sarah Palin jokes are a growth industry. Of course, you’ll end up running against the same people to be president of your organization, SOMETHING VERY RESPECTED BY MANY EMPLOYERS, and then you won’t talk anymore. The best House for these people is Winthrop. We don’t go to Winthrop, and we don’t want to see these people.  
The $75 Shaq Rookie Card Group: As all Harvard College athletes go on to the big leagues to make the big bucks, they should only associate with other athletes who they can be sure aren’t parasites gaming to one day be their agent, lawyer, accountant, or Kabbala guru. Living with other athletes would be a paradise for you. You could have a Matt Christopher book club—solely with your roommates! Think of the new insights you’ll glean for your Gov thesis on “The Kid Who Only Hit Homers.” Just remember, 50 percent of athlete blocking groups fail because jock itch is a communicable disease. The best House for athletes is PfoHo, so they can stay extra fit on their walks to practice and bring one home for Fair Harvard! 
The High School Stereotypes Group: This is for kids who embraced every ’80s teen movie in the worst way possible. Instead of running from your label, you embraced your identity and subsumed yourself in it. They include stoners, drama FANATICS, band chicks (slutty, right?), class presidents (except this time, through the UC, student politics will bring about real change), and most prominently, monora(c)i(a)l blocking groups. You have identified yourself as an individual in the reality TV sense of the word—someone who can be identified in seconds by the stereotype they embody. Just like in high school, your House will ostracize you, and aren’t they justified? The best house for you is Lowell. Its social hierarchy mimics the high school ambiance you yearn for. 
Floaters: You are unique. So unique in fact that you couldn’t find one person out of 1650 to block with. [3] Welcome to the rest of your existence, a single point in a limitless void. Hell, you might be on to something.

The Harvard Computer Society sent me a Valentine’s Day gift this year: the names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of ten Harvard girls. According to HCS, I was highly compatible with all of them.  
They were my Datamatch results, the product of 28 questions carefully crafted by the guys I see passed out on Cabot Library couches in the middle of the day. Probably because they stayed up late playing World ofWarcraft. I glanced at the list of girls, and was surprised I knew almost none of them. The e-mail ended: “You’re under no obligation to contact the people on your list, but heck, why not?”  Heck, indeed. 
So, I asked myself, why not?  I’m a senior. I’m single. If one of these girls goes Fatal Attraction on me, I’m out of here in three months. And when am I going to receive contact information for ten (most likely) intelligent, (probably) interesting, and (hopefully) attractive girls ever again? 
I came up with a game plan: e-mail my top results, set up some dates over the next week, and see how things went. I opened up my Facebook profile so they could see what they were getting themselves into. None of the girls knew I was asking my other results. None of them knew that they would end up—anonymously—in FM. 
I poked around a bit, asked some mutual friends about the girls, and feedback started coming in. My #1 result, a senior, received nothing but praise. A mutual friend said, “She just has this presence with her smile when she walks into a room. She’s great to be around.”  Well played, Datamatch. I knew I had to treat #1 right, so I wanted to do dinner in Boston. I asked her out to Figs on Charles Street. She wrote back the next day, and we settled on Wednesday night. 
I got there a little early and waited for her in the restaurant. We shook hands, and, just like a Government thesis writer, I started my argument off with numbers. “We are 96.92 percent compatible, so this should be the greatest date of our lives. No pressure.”   
Datamatch is genius at common interest. There aren’t many other people at Harvard who love country music, but both of us did. We liked the same movies, read the same books, and might both be across the pond in six months. She was cool. When the check came, I put

my card down immediately, yet she offered to pay. When I waved her off, she didn’t argue. Harvard women: take note. 
Full disclosure: Datamatch did have one glitch that night. She liked the Red Sox. Still, it was nice to finally meet a Sox fan who could be diplomatic towards my Yankees loyalty.  
A few days later, I met up with my #10, another senior. Not quite as compatible (93.07), so I suggested getting burritos at Felipe’s. Datamatch strikes again!  I love Bill Clinton, and she had interned at the Clinton Foundation. Conversation was easy, but I couldn’t tell if she 


was single or if she even thought it was a date. Maybe I shouldn’t have picked burritos.  
I picked Peet’s Coffee for #6 and #7. No, not at the same time. #7 didn’t order anything, and #6 ordered the same drink as me, a Masala Chai Latte. Since Peet’s is usually packed, I walked over both times to the Forum at the Kennedy School to hang out. I had never met or seen either of them before. #7 was cool and confident. When she told me she wanted to be a screenwriter, I asked her a million questions because I love movies, so it ended up being more like an interrogation than a friendly coffee date. My fault, not Datamatch’s. #6 was a politico like me, but dwelled on it a bit too much. I worked for Hillary for two summers, but a conversation about politics on a first date is like a chicken running through a minefield. It never gets off the ground, and the results aren’t pretty.  
And that was all. #2 and #9, both freshmen, sent apologetic e-mails declining my offer. #9 wrote, “Life is just a little too complicated for me right now,” while #2 replied, “I forgot to remove myself from the system before the deadline.”  I hope their excuse-making skills improve before senior year. I actually knew #5, and so I believed her when she said she was busy practicing for Ghungroo and writing her thesis. But is anyone really too busy for ice cream?  #3, another senior, was a roommate of someone with whom I had a little history, and she waved me off by suggesting we meet up at senior bar. I was supposed to go out to Cambridge 1 with #4, and she agreed, but then got “busy,” too. I never used to think I had much more free time than most people, but that has got to be the reason. 
I had no overarching philosophy for Datamatch, but I agree with N. Gregory Mankiw: Harvard is the world’s most elite dating service. It makes JDate.com look like Craigslist. Why don’t we take more advantage of it?  Worst case scenario, you spend a little time with someone, learn about their lives and their interests. You might learn something new about yourself. You find out what you really value. And, maybe, just maybe, you get a second date.

Take the envelope, Patrick,” my blockmate urged me.  As if still frozen from the previous night’s chilly River Run, I remained motionless and stared blankly at two over-eager gentlemen, clad in Pforzheimer gear. I was unable to take the envelope. They gently placed the death notice in my blockmate’s outstretched hand and assured us that everything would turn out well as the door closed. I whipped an already-beat Top-Sider at my poster-clad Pennypacker wall. After a year of scabies, long walks to Annenberg, and gazing at a parking-lot vista from my common room window, the prospect of river views and convenient access to the Square was tantalizing. The Union dormite-to-Quadling story is equivalent to a rags-to-new-rags tale.   Friends who had been placed in a dumpy river House insisted I was welcome to move in with them. They jest, I thought. Inspired by the likes of Oprah and the Pope, I spent the summer contemplating the positives of Quaddage. I recalled my tour of Pforzheimer House on that fateful March day. Everyone in PfoHo did seem quite happy about their unfortunate circumstances. I’d never seen such happy people before—except for people on drugs. And like people on drugs, these citizens of PfoHo made grand promises. 210 square foot singles. Perpetual ragers in the “Belltower.” Many mirrors lining the hallway walls. I like looking at myself, I thought. Maybe things could be bearable. Then came rooming assignments.  Some sort of technology glitch must have occurred, for my roommate and I were given two adjacent cupboards under the pretense of a double. And the view from the cramped quarters inspired nothing but nostalgia in me—another year to be spent looking out on pavement and fading skid marks. Rereading the interhouse transfer policy for the umpteenth time, I accepted the fact that PfoHo was my unchangeable fate for a predetermined period. Nine months, in fact. Like the baby daddy of a pregnant Catholic schoolgirl, I had to stay with the carrier of my pfetus until I could find another woman.Yet I needed a little loving myself during this awkward time. Like many a baby daddy, I started seeing someone else to take my mind off PfoHo. Her name was Dunster. Surprising to some, I became smitten with a cockroach-riddled dame who is far more beautiful on the outside than on the inside. But it wasn’t the physical building that drew me; it was the people.  To be honest, the affair began the same day I moved to the Quad. After an evening of bacchanalian revelry with my Meese friends, I jaunted to Dunster and slept in a makeshift bed on the suite’s floor. This recurred the next two nights. Soon I was like a crossbreed of a bag lady and walk-of-shamer. Every other day or so, I would trudge back to the Quad with a gym bag stuffed full of laundry, returning with a fresh supply of duds, contact lenses, and the like. Yet the delight of arriving back “home” to Dunster overshadowed any inconvenience of vagabonding.Still, a more permanent solution seemed necessary.   Days after my official PfoHo move-in, a second move-in commenced. Armed with a single Harvard Mail Service dolly, two of my adoptive Dunster “blockmates” and I rolled my six-foot-long black pleather Chesterfield-esque foldout couch to my new home.  With such a wide load, we literally took to the streets, navigating Brattle and Mt. Auburn Streets amidst honking cars and gaping pedestrians. I loved being a spectacle, pushing this symbol of permanence to my friends’ digs. This sofa would be my bed for the next nine months.  The move-in continued gradually. Late weekend nights in the Quad became an excuse to lug my speakers, a box of ties, or my worn Hillary Clinton poster to my new room.  These new roomies didn’t merely let me store my junk in the ready-to-burst walk through. My personal memorabilia joined theirs on the wall, in this room I now referred to as “our room.” Indeed, Dunster became my adoptive house. House residents largely forgot my status as a squatter. Once my roommate secured me a room key, so did I.  Yes, PfoHo tried to win my love back with subtle interventions staged by various individuals, and my parents questioned my sanity (and that of my foster blockmates). But the Dunster community’s magnetism provided too strong of a pull towards the Charles. Plus, my ID magically swipes into all Dunster entryways after midnight. This isn’t supposed to happen. Next fall, I will officially be a Moose. Yet my reputation as Dunster’s gypsy (or creeper to some) will likely stick. Sure, I’ll no longer need to take naps in Lamont while waiting for a roommate to unlock the suite door. And a dresser will certainly be a welcome replacement to the current system of placing my wardrobe in various cubbies throughout the room.  But I chose to be a roving nomad for a year because I couldn’t find what I needed elsewhere: my peeps.  —D. Patrick Knoth ’11 is a History and Literature concentrator In Pforzheimer Dunster House. He still rocks baglady chic.

Last Friday night in the MAC, around twenty eager competitors attired in everything from boat shoes and a Polo to full athletic gear and a “Balls of Fury” shirt ascended to the basketball courts. Here, they battled for the intramural sport championship treasured most by every House: table tennis.This was not the ping pong played in your basement back home; this was an all-out, Forrest Gump-style paddle whacking session. And to those that question the legitimacy of table tennis as a sport, Winthrop resident and team member Norman Y. Yao ’09, president of the Harvard Table Tennis Club and commonly regarded as the best player on campus, adamantly defended the sport. “They are taking away baseball in the Olympics but you better damn well believe that they will have table tennis,” he said.The most glaring issue with the tournament was that, out of the 20 or so players, only one was female, a surprising fact. “Steroids are not an issue in ping pong. This is the one sport where there should be as many girls as guys,” said Christopher J. Carothers ’11, an Eliot resident and team member.The most famous person in attendance was Enoch Kyerematen, a table tennis celebrity in his own right. Kyerematen, a former member of Ghana’s national table tennis team, is now a Winthrop security guard. With his 71 years of wisdom and astounding skills, Kyerematen is the sensei of table tennis players at Harvard. “He taught everybody on the team everything they know,” said Ronald K. Kamdem ’10, a teammate of Kyerematen. In the tournament, Kyerematen lent his talents to the champion Winthrop A squad.Winthrop continued their dominance of the IM scene by placing two teams in the semifinals of the tournament, with their A team easily defeating Eliot and then Kirkland to ultimately clinch the title.

If you went to the gym last weekend for a pickup game of basketball, or maybe mistakenly showed up for an intramural volleyball game, you might have been surprised to find hundreds of high heeled women in flashy makeup and men dressed to the nines, instead of a few sweaty students in gym shorts.  Why this dramatic change in scenery? The 18th Annual Harvard Ballroom Invitational, which converted the fourth floor of the Malkin Athletic Center into a sea of sequins and bright colors as dancers from all over the country took to the gymnasium floor.  According to Masha Maystrovskaya ’11, the Harvard team’s captain, the competition takes place over the span of two days, with around 700 competitors and probably more than 1000 spectators. “Our team has been doing really well competitively this year with the Tufts, BU, and Brown competitions, so I think we’re set up to do pretty well,” she said. And pretty well they did. Chun Xue Patricia Hao ’09 came away with a win in the Gold Level Latin competition, happy to see her hard work pay off. “Since freshman year I’ve been running off in the middle of the night for five hour practices,” she said. “My friends all ask, ‘what are you doing with your time?’ Certainly not schoolwork. It’s great to have my friends here to see what I’m doing during my disappearances from the dorm.” Hao’s partner, Adrian L. Sanborn ’11, rookie captain for the team, echoed Maystrovskaya’s sentiments. “They’ve been doing really well at past competitions and I’m looking forward to seeing them do well again,” he said. These rookies might not be rookies for long, though. As Sorina Casian, a Harvard Business School student dancing with the team, said, “dancing is a virus—once you start you can’t stop.”

As an Adams man, I would fight for interhouse dining restrictions, perhaps not quite to the death, but at least to the breaking of any bones which would not affect my ability to climb stairs or play one-armed basketball. We live in a society. There are rules. I respect that.Each year on the Thursday before spring break, the gods make a judgment regarding your freshman year conduct. If you acted like a cool sophomore or at least a moderately popular junior, they reward you with Adams. On the other hand, if you used a baby picture for your facebook.com profile to look cute to girls, they give you Cabot. Thus, dining hall restrictions reinforce the Will of the Gods. However, there are fair critiques of some houses’ restrictions. Hey, Eliot, you aren’t fooling anyone. We don’t want what you’re selling. Quincy, your panini grill is hot on all sides, not just the grill side. It burns people, and no one likes you. Dear Kirkland, nice face. Lowell, I’m just going to accuse you of having cockroaches.Yet Adams deserves every ounce of prestige credited to it. So, if you stroll in like you are the cock of the walk, despite being a freshman or, even grosser, a Dunster resident, and a handsome gentleman in a lifeguard chair re-stolen from the MAC blows a whistle, mocks you on a megaphone, and leads two hundred people hand-picked by the gods in booing you, deal with it. Turn around and go to Mather. Don’t try coming in the back, either. I used to sneak into dining halls too, then my dad got a job.

As a proud Radcliffe resident, I’ll be the first to say it: Quad life is rough. Roll out of bed two minutes late for class? You’re already 20 minutes late, shuttle time. Want to schedule a meeting in your neighborhood? Just try to get friends to venture north and watch as their faces contort in disbelief. Have an hour between classes? Two hours? Three? You’ll be spending a good amount of time playing the “is it worth it?” game in your head and probably miss the shuttle doing it. Forget to bring your notes to section in half an hour? Guess you’ll be taking a vow of silence. 
But a life of lateness prepared me for this perennial tardiness. In fact, my northern abode has given me a convenient excuse. 
What I wasn’t prepared for was starvation. For example, a week ago I strolled into Adams—a Quadling safe-house of sorts—to swipe in for my nighttime sustenance, only to be confronted by a foreboding sign “No Interhouse Dining”. The sign could just as well have been in Quincy, Lowell, or Winthrop. It might as well have read “Community Dining,” or “Screw you, Asli. Eat your left pinkie, for all I care.” 
Interhouse restrictions are a blatant injustice. Freshmen have Annenberg, but what do Quadlings have? Boloco? The guys there know me as “Regular Mediterranean Tofu” from all my post-rejection visits and I am, accordingly, ashamed. 
Adams House was the latest strike in this culinary crusade to make commuters second-class citizens. Listen up, river dwellers and your HUDS accomplices: we won’t stand for it. Le Resistance is slowly forming against you and your delusion that the arbitrary housing lottery somehow made you more entitled to sustenance. And thanks, random girl in Adams for refusing to call me your “guest.” You will be the first to go.

In part of a University-wide trend to share intellectual property, Harvard Kennedy School faculty voted overwhelmingly last week to allow open access for all scholarly articles written by faculty.The change—which took effect immediately after a vote at a faculty meeting last Tuesday—means that all faculty will permit the Kennedy School to distribute their articles through DASH (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard) repository, which is an online database currently being developed by the Office for Scholarly Communication. This makes the Kennedy School the third Harvard school to allow open access for its journals, following the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Law School.According to Doug L. Gavel, media relations manager at the Kennedy School, approximately 98 percent of faculty members who attended the meeting voted in favor of the new policy.“As an academic, I’m very excited to be able to publish my articles broadly,” said Erich J. Muehlegger, an assistant professor at the Kennedy School.While the professors recognized that the move towards open access will likely hurt the journal industry, most still support open access.“I understand the economic pressures the publishing houses are under. They have been losing money for a long time,” said Professor Matthew A. Baum. “But I think it’s unfortunate when intellectual property gets put under lock and key.”Similarly, Professor Stuart M. Shieber said that while there was a worry that allowing open access might affect the business model of subscription-based journals, he personally felt there are no drawbacks to an open access program. He added that faculty members who would prefer that their articles not be accessed by the general public can opt out of the program for any article.Professor and Director of the University Library Robert C. Darnton said he saw no immediate threat to scholarly journals. He said support for open access has been overwhelming because many faculty members believe that they have a responsibility to the larger public. Associate Dean for Research Matthew L. Alper added that faculty are focused on the issue of the public good, with a desire to share their research quickly and cheaply, particularly in the developing world where library access is limited. While many students were not aware of the policy change, they said they thought it was a positive development. Kennedy School students Daniel C.I. Bjorkegren and Dan M. Rakove  said they thought making academic information available to the public was an important part of the school’s mission.Darnton said he expects that more Harvard schools will adopt open access. “I feel that the momentum is building up so that Harvard’s example will spread far and wide,” he said.—Staff writer Niha S.

For the freshmen who will wake up to a horde of drunken Cabot, Currier, or Pforzheimer House residents outside their dorm rooms tomorrow morning, the simple realization of being quaded may not be the sole reason for their angst.
According to George J.J. Hayward ’11, a Currier House resident and member of the Undergraduate Council, several security issues have recently been raised by Quad residents, including inconsistent cellphone reception that poses a potential safety hazard for students.
The sophomore—whose cellphone reception was cut off twice during the course of this interview—said that emergency calls could be compromised if cellphone reception is very poor or non-existent.
“If you’re running in the Currier House cardio room, and go into cardiac arrest, like what unfortunately happened to a student earlier this year on the River Run, there would be no way to call an ambulance,” said Hayward, who is also a current Crimson editorial editor. “It’s a tragedy waiting to happen.”
Such concerns have been voiced before. A former Cabot House resident, Allegra J.S. Lichauco ’08, pushed for Cingular Wireless to improve cell phone service in the fall of 2005. More recently, Hayward said he spearheaded a move to install a small cellphone tower in the quad, which would enhance the quality of reception for students with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon phones. 
He added that installing transmitters, wireless boosters, and fire-optic cables would also improve cellphone reception, supplementing more short-term, inexpensive options that the University is exploring. 
But Hayward said University Hall is still grappling with how to fund the $1.2 million proposed plan—especially in the current economic downturn. 
“Harvard must act this year,” Hayward added. “These aren’t questions to ask after someone’s been hurt.”
Pfoho resident dean Lisa Boes said that the issue of shoddy reception was brought to the fore at the beginning of this academic year, in light of last semester’s muggings in Cambridge Common—crimes that prompted the Harvard University Police Department to assign several additional officers to the Quad.
COMING CHANGES
What quadlings may receive are ATMs conveniently located in close proximity to residential Houses.
Currently, Quad residents have to walk to either Porter or Harvard Squares to withdraw money—which becomes a problem when students need fast cash at night, when regular shuttle service is not available. 
HUPD has agreed to complete an audit to assess the potential safety hazards that might arise from installing an ATM in a residential area—such as piggybacking and muggings, according to a HUPD representative at last month’s Committee on House Life meeting.
The audit is slated to be finished by Commencement, said Associate Dean of Residential Life Suzy M. Nelson.
“We have to continually remind students about the elementary levels of safety,” Nelson said, adding above all, to “use common sense.”

Harvard Law School professor Ryan Goodman will depart for New York University this fall, NYU officials announced yesterday.Goodman, who specializes in international law, has taught at Harvard since 2002, and received tenure in 2006. He currently serves as the director of the Law School’s Human Rights Program, and co-taught a workshop on international law with Law School professor William P. Alford last semester. “He’s been a wonderful colleague in addition to being a very distinguished scholar and a very accomplished teacher, and I’m sorry to see him go,” Alford said, adding that they would remain colleagues and friends even after Goodman’s move south.Goodman, who received both a Ph.D in sociology and a JD from Yale, conducts research on patterns in the development of legal institutions around the world, integrating sociological and legal analysis approaches.At NYU, Goodman will assume a full professorship at the law school, and will also be affiliated with the sociology and politics departments.Goodman could not be reached for comment yesterday.Alford said that although Goodman would be a loss to the Law School, his colleagues would continue to produce strong scholarship in the field, since Harvard had built a strong contingent of international law scholars during the tenure of Law School dean Elena Kagan.“We have probably the most intellectually diverse group of faculty in the United States working on international and comparative law issues, with all kinds of different viewpoints,” Alford said. “Once in a while, someone chooses to go elsewhere.”During the few years he spent at the Law School, Goodman encouraged study on national human rights institutions and on the relationship between medical professionals and human rights, said Mindy J. Roseman, academic director of the Human Rights Program.“When he came, he had a certain vision for the program that we worked together to implement,” she said.Goodman’s departure marks one of the rare instances of tenured professors leaving the Law School in recent years—the hiring frenzy in the past five years has seen Harvard poach more than a few distinguished legal scholars from rival institutions, including NYU.But NYU has also embarked upon an ambitious faculty recruitment campaign, hiring almost 20 full professors away from other law schools since 2004.Several professors at the Law School said that Goodman chose to relocate largely because of his and his family’s preference to live in New York, rather than the Boston area.In addition to boasting a roster of international law stars, NYU has the attraction of being situated near the United Nations and Wall Street, both of which provide ample opportunities to study globally relevant issues, Alford said.As a result, he said, he was not surprised that Goodman had received an offer to continue his scholarship in what may be the country’s most internationally diverse city.“[Goodman]’s been in great demand, and he’s very highly regarded,” he said. “A number of institutions would love to have him on their faculty.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

Folk and acoustic music are no longer the only substances flowing freely at Club Passim—the legendary Harvard Square venue has begun serving beer and wine, breaking its dry spell for the first time since its founding in 1958. The historic 47 Palmer Street establishment—which has served as a stepping stone to many music legends, including Bob Dylan and Joan Baez—served its first beer last Friday. Managers said that the decision took into consideration both the organization’s current financial straits and the repeated requests by customers for a wider range of beverages. According to Passim’s public relations coordinator Susan Scotti, the owners’ desire to preserve the intimate, sedate culture of the venue led Passim to limit its beverage options to non-alcoholic teas, coffee, and sodas. But recently, Passim’s budget difficulties have led its owners to reconsider the dry policy in the hopes that serving alcohol might increase revenue.“Some people may have avoided coming here before and may have gone to another venue for drinks,” said Scotti. “Now they can have both an amazing artist and the chance to relax and have a couple of beers or a glass of wine.”Club Passim is managed by the non-profit umbrella organization Passim Folk Music and Culture Center, which also operates several music-related programs. The organization has recently seen its main sources of revenue—donations, fund-raising, and membership fees—decline during the recession. In 2008, Passim’s financial hurdles, which Scotti attributed in part to lackluster ticket sales, resulted in a 30% staff cut.Club Passim, nestled between Church and Brattle Streets, has been in existence under various guises since it first opened as the jazz venue Club 47 more than five decades ago. Matt Smith, Passim’s manager and booking agent, said that he did not foresee alcohol affecting Passim’s culture. “We’re just providing something else for customers and giving them an option that they didn’t have before,” he said.Smith said that Passim’s lack of a bar and its limited alcohol offerings—only two types of beer and wine and no hard liquor—would prevent the venue from becoming drunken and noisy.Smith said that so far, the move to serve alcohol has been a “resounding success.” Sales over the weekend were “very good” as customers collectively imbibed two kegs of beer. “Our first two performers last week went up on stage with beers in hand,” Smith said, laughing.Club Passim also adjoins the restaurant Veggie Planet, which shares a close business relationship with the music venue. While Club Passim owns the liquor license, it is Veggie Planet that actually serves the alcohol and keeps 30% of the profits from drink sales. Veggie Planet owner Adam Penn said he was optimistic about the decision’s potential to benefit both Veggie Planet and Club Passim.Beside offering alcohol, Passim is also testing other tactics to increase its financial viability. In addition to expanding its non-profit offerings, Scotti said that Passim is reaching out to Harvard students by offering discounted shows and memberships, marketing its Tuesday open mike nights, and featuring artists signed with student-run Veritas Records.But Maxwell A. Newman-Plotnick ’11, who has seen music performances there and is currently working on a documentary about Club Passim for a VES class, said that he did not anticipate more Harvard students frequenting the space.“It’s a niche venue,” he said. “People go there because they’re going to see folk music or a specific performer, not because they want to get a beer.”—Staff Writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

In reaction to her nomination by President Barack Obama as Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, friends and teachers of Margaret A. Hamburg ’77 described the former New York City health commissioner as a lively student with varied interests during her time on campus. “She wasn’t a blindly channelled science geek from the get-go,” said Janine P. Scott ’77, Hamburg’s roommate during her freshman and senior years. After her undergraduate years, Hamburg studied at Harvard Medical School. She then went on to conduct neuroscience research at The Rockefeller University in New York before becoming one of the youngest people ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine. Her FDA nomination, announced last week, awaits confirmation by the Senate. In his weekly address on Saturday, Obama praised Hamburg for having a “reputation of integrity...[and] a record of achievement in making Americans safer.” From Hamburg’s days as an undergraduate, Scott said that she fondly remembers their many exploits together, from travelling all the way to Charleston, SC to see a play by Mark P. O’Donnell ’76, a friend who would go on to win a Tony for “Hairspray,” to simply hanging out with friends at The Harvard Crimson, for which they both reported. Hamburg penned several in-depth reviews on rock and roll albums, including ‘Black and Blue,’ the Rolling Stones’ 1976 album. Former Medical School professor Leon Eisenberg said that he recognized Hamburg’s academic potential and unique scholarly interests quite early in her Harvard Medical School career. “From the beginning, she proved to be one of our best students. What made her different was her interest in population health as well as patient-doctor relationships and care,” said Eisenberg. Eisenberg’s wife and former Dean of Students at Harvard Medical School, Carola Eisenberg, said that she is particularly excited for Hamburg’s nomination because of its implications for women. “I don’t have to tell you that there are difficulties for women to succeed, particularly in academic centers,” said Eisenberg. Mark P. Szpak ’77, another undergraduate classmate, said that he recalls frequently seeing Hamburg around campus. The two both lived in Mower freshman year, then became Adams House residents together and both concentrated in Psychology and Social Relations. Szpak said that he has faith in her ability. “You couldn’t entrust the FDA to better hands,” he said. Last week, Obama tapped another Harvard Medical School alumnus, Joshua M. Sharfstein ’91, to serve as Deputy Commissioner of the FDA.

While six courses were approved for General Education credit late last month, one of the curriculum’s eight required categories now only lists one newly created course, and another still offers no new classes.As 1600 incoming freshman and approximately half of the Class of 2012 prepare to fulfill Gen Ed requirements, whether or not the nascent program has taken its intended shape remains in question. While two of the courses approved on February 26 are brand new, four of them are currently offered. There will be no changes to Government 20: “Introduction to Comparative Politics,” which will now fulfill the Societies of the World requirement, said the course’s professor, Steven R. Levitsky.Levitsky, whose class is one of the most popular undergraduate courses, said that there was no clear set of criteria to make Gov 20 fit within Gen Ed’s goals.“I am on the Gen Ed committee and I still don’t know what the philosophy is,” Levitsky said.Three other courses currently offered at Harvard—Government 10: “Introduction to Political Thought,” Government 50: “Introduction to Political Science Research Methods,” and Science A-41: “The Einstein Revolution”—have also been approved for General Education credit. The other two approved courses are newly-developed, but there is still some uncertainty about whether one of them will even be available next year. The Gen Ed Web site notes that Science of the Physical Universe 16: “Physics in the 21st Century” is to be offered in the Spring of 2010, but the professor of the course, Christopher W. Stubbs, said that this might not be the case. “Gen Ed and the Core are not the only teaching demands our department has,” Stubbs said, adding that his probable sabbatical in the 2010-2011 academic year might also contribute to the course’s postponement. So far, this is the only newly-developed course to have been approved for the Science of the Physical Universe category, one of the eight required fields under the new curriculum. Stubbs said his department has been trying hard to provide students with an adequate selection of courses, adding that he is sure students will have good offerings. The other newly-developed course—Societies of the World 20: “China in the Wider World 1600-2000”—has yet to post a description.—Staff writer Rachel A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a symposium last night in Harvard Hall, four scholars from prominent universities presented research that stretches the limits of traditional economics with modern scientific advances.The two-hour event—entitled “A Symposium on Economic Decision Making”—focused on the nascent field of neuroeconomics, a combination of neuroscience, psychology, and economics that challenges classical assumptions of economic theory.“Economics is actually an abstract, profoundly wrong model of human behavior,” said Drazen Prelec ’78, a professor of management science at MIT, later redeeming the postulates behind economics by saying that “without those false assumptions, we could not have been making the progress we have been making.”Others voiced similar criticisms of economics. Harvard Economics Professor David I. Laibson ’88 noted that economics reduces individuals into simple decision-makers instead of acknowledging that people have several competing mental processes. Brown Neurobiology Professor Peter E. Politser argued that economics ignores the nuances of decision making. “To understand decisions across many contexts, we often have to ask not just what people choose, but how and why,” he said.Throughout the symposium, the professors stressed the discipline’s infancy.“I think the field of neuroeconomics is not fully defined,” said Yale Neurobiology Professor Daeyeol Lee at the beginning of his presentation on the similarity between human and monkey decision making paradigms.Laibson cautioned against applying preliminary findings of the developing field—which at present may have primarily microeconomic implications—to the current recession, but maintained that “unambiguously, the current crisis has extraordinarily rich psychological origins.”The event was co-sponsored by the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior and the Harvard Undergraduate Economics Association. Sophie R. Wharton ’11, secretary of the HSMBB and one of the lead organizers of the symposium, said that organizers were pleased with the event, which drew students from Tufts and Harvard Medical School.“I think it’s cool to see an important area of study at the very beginning,” said attendee Aaron P. Mattis ’12. “It seems like something where undergraduates can have a lot of input.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the economy continuing in a state of peril, business schools—including Harvard’s—have started to take heat from critics.
Analysts and academics have started to doubt the education given to students at business schools, and have asserted that a better business education could perhaps have helped diminish fallout from the current economic crisis.
An article in The New York Times earlier this week noted that common complaints have included a focus on approaches that are overly scientific, and that business schools do not produce entrepreneurs or leaders, only individuals intent on making financial gains. 
The article also noted complaints that business schools instruct students by having them solve unrealistic problems in a short amount of time.
Harvard Business School was repeatedly referenced in the article, but many students at the Business School said they disagree with such sentiments. 
“Yes, we are taught to solve problems in as little as 3 hours, but this gives us more of a realization of the true complexities rather than giving us the unrealistic ambition that we can solve real problems in that time,” said Jason V. Bhardwaj, a student at the Business School. “The school errs on the side of giving us less time per problem to expose us to a variety of situations.”
Shweta Agarwal, also an MBA candidate, agreed. 
“HBS provides us with a general management education with required courses in leadership, corporate responsibility and accountability,” she said. “The trend of some students selecting Wall Street over management in industry was a result of the market, not the education.” 
Faculty members added that the Business School has taken many steps in the past to revise the curriculum and address previous concerns. 
“When it comes to issues of leadership, values, ethics, you can have standalone courses and you can embed the issues into discipline based courses like finance, marketing and strategy,”
In light of these reports, Benjamin G. Edelman—an assistant professor at the Business School—said that he sees a new opportunity to emphasize the school’s revised curriculum. 
“My students see an opportunity here, much to their credit, to re–double their efforts–to start companies or join startups where just a year ago they would primarily have joined multinationals firms almost by default,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 2000, three of the major political organizations on campus—the Undergraduate Council, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Student Advisory Committee to the Institute of Politics—are headed up by female leaders. Andrea R. Flores ’10 serves as president of the UC, Eva Z. Lam ’10 is president of the Dems, and Mary K.B. Cox ’10 is president of the SAC. All three women came together last Thursday to discuss leadership as part of the Women’s Center’s “Women’s Week 2009: Engendering Change.” But while they all are at the helm of three of Harvard’s largest  political organizations, their experiences and perceptions of bias have been shaped by the cultures of their respective clubs.The Dems and the IOP both have a 1:1 ratio of males to female members, versus 2:1 on the UC.Of the three, Flores is the most vocal about the double standards she has faced as a woman on the council. Cox, who is the third consecutive woman to inherit the organization’s presidency, said she still faces the vestiges of a male-dominated IOP. By contrast, Lam, whose organization is one of the most progressive on campus, said she has experienced relatively little discrimination as an ambitious woman. Despite this variation, all three have spoken to the importance of getting more women involved in politics and leadership on campus. But thus far, their experiences as leaders seem to be more representative of present attitudes toward woman leaders than emblematic of a shift in perspective brought about by their election.ANDREA R. FLORESFlores is the first female UC president in six years—putting her at the helm of the organization that has been slowest among the three political clubs to make strides towards gender equity. When Flores joined the UC her freshman year, she was one of only two freshman women on the Council. She said she has faced sexism throughout her time on the Council and does not see Harvard’s student governing body as any more progressive than that of other institutions.“I very much had to prove myself in a way male freshman reps did not,” she said.In the second semester of her sophomore year, she served as Finance Committee chair and held that position for the first semester of her junior year.Yet when it came time for well-positioned juniors to consider running for president, Flores said, she was asked by two potential candidates to serve as their vice-president.She said she did not believe a man with her qualifications would have been presumed to be merely a vice-presidential candidate.Flores said she believed she had to prove herself each year in a way that men on the Council did not have to.Flores also said she is held to a “higher standard” when she is out on a Friday and Saturday night than the male members of the council.But despite years-long female underrepresentation on the Council that still exists today, three of the four highest leadership posts are held by women—who may now be in the position to serve as role models for a new batch of woman leaders.MARY K.B. COXCox said she initially felt that the IOP was “very much an old boys’ club,” and despite a recent rise in female participation at the IOP, she felt that her gender ultimately served as both an asset and a liability in her bid for SAC President.Cox entered the IOP as a freshman and was initially put off by the lack of diversity in its forums. “There was basically a feeling when you came to an IOP event that there were a bunch of men,” she said. “They were all very similar and knew everything about politics.”Eventually drawn back to the IOP by the strength of its fellows program. Cox became Fellows Chair in her sophomore year and began contemplating the presidency. Despite her motivation, Cox said she lacked a role model for how to run a campaign because the previous female SAC presidents had either been appointed or had run uncontested.Cox eventually competed against Tejas A. Sathian ’10 for the presidency. “People say things—‘she’s really intense, she’s really hardcore,’” Cox recalled. “Tejas was equally intense and hardcore, and I don’t know why it took a different tone when it came to me.”Nonetheless, Cox said her gender also helped her to connect to women in the IOP.While the IOP now boasts 50 percent female participation in its advisory council, Cox’s experience seems to underlie a continuing double-standard for the way voters regard ambitious female candidates.EVA Z. LAMLam said she did not see her sex as a major factor in her candidacy for the  Dems’     top spot, nor has she seen overt sexism as a member of the club.“I didn’t wake up in the morning and say I, Eva Lam, am going to run as the female president of the Harvard Democrats,” she said. “I had the good fortune of not having to think about gender too much when I was running.”Lam represents two groups traditionally underrepresented in Harvard politics: she is a woman and she is a lesbian.While she said she does not believe her political ambitions at Harvard were greatly affected by her gender, this does her not affect her belief that it was important to get more qualified women to run for elected positions.She said that if there was a hypothetical race between a man and a woman of equal qualification “there is more value to having a woman,” adding that certainly does not translate into unyielding support for female candidates. “I didn’t vote for Sarah Palin,” she said.Nor did she support Hillary Clinton in the primary race against Barack Obama.Men alone are not the problem, she said.“There are women who are uncomfortable with other women in leadership roles,” Lam said. “Women have been socialized into a lot of the same views that men have been socialized into.”Lam said that she herself has been guilty of bias against women.“I judge debate occasionally, and I almost find myself holding women to higher standards,” but she said she tries to take that into consideration before giving out scores.—Staff writer Eric P.

It might have been St. Patrick’s Day, but the Harvard men’s volleyball team (8-6, 3-1 EIVA Hay Division) would need no luck to beat the Engineers of MIT (22-11). With a raucous crowd cheering on the Crimson, Harvard swept its cross-town rival 3-0 (30-23, 30-17, 30-26), giving the team its fifth win in the last six games. 
“With the exception of the Princeton match last weekend, we’ve really been playing well each game,” coach Brian Baise said. “Last Saturday against East Stroudsburg, we were in control the entire game, and tonight we did it again. I feel great at this point.”
“They beat us last year, which was one of the worst games we ever played,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd added. “We were pretty pissed off, so it feels really good to get a win.”
The Crimson started off the match on fire, jumping to a 12-7 lead off of a block by junior Soren Rosier. While Rosier and junior co-captain Gil Weintraub were stalwarts on the defensive front, contributing three of the six total blocks earned by Harvard in the first set, Weissbourd and junior Erik Kuld took care of the offense by notching six and four kills, respectively. Six of the seven players who played in the game registered a kill for the Crimson, providing balance across the board.
“We have a lot of well-rounded players this year and they play all over the court,” Weissbourd said. “They do everything.”
An error committed by MIT allowed Harvard to take the first set with a solid 30-23 win.
With momentum in hand, the Crimson continued to dominate all aspects of the game in the second set. Crisp and powerful serves prevented the Engineers from establishing any sort of offense all evening, limiting MIT to a .182 hitting percentage in the second set. 
“Their big advantage is their serving,” MIT coach Paul Dill said. “It’s more than we’re used to seeing, so that took us out of our offense.”
Weissbourd was once again Mr. Do-it-all, serving up back-to-back aces to give Harvard a comfortable 11-4 lead. A few plays later, Weissbourd then smashed a powerful serve to the opponent before forcefully killing the ball to give the Crimson a ten point lead. The senior standout would finish the game with 21 kills and an incredible .667 hitting percentage.
“[Weissbourd] is just such a dominant player at this level,” Dill said. “We wanted to contain him as best as we could, and there were times when we could, but they had too many weapons. I won’t be sorry to see him leave, but he’s been fun to watch for the last four years.”
Enjoying a .440 team attack percentage, Harvard took the second set 30-17 and looked focused on finishing off the Engineers. 
But MIT was not ready to take the T home quite yet. The Engineers finally got their offensive game going, setting balls effectively and jumping out ahead for a 11-6 lead. Looking for any sort of spark, MIT and its fans were suddenly reenergized after a successful block by freshman David Thomas of a Weissbourd potential kill. 
The Crimson, having faced enthusiastic squads many times before, would not relent. Eventually, the team turned to Weissbourd once again to even the frame at 21. 
“Often in the third game, the team facing elimination is fighting for its life,” Baise said. I think we’ve reached a spot where we don’t panic, where we can settle down and focus on our serves, and don’t give up leads as much anymore. I attribute that to our mental game, and we’re playing with more confidence.”
With the game still close, Harvard started to pull away slowly, relying on another service ace by Weissbourd and a kill by senior Jeff Nathan to put the Crimson up by two. Finally, an attack error by MIT junior Eric Reuland gave Harvard the win. 
“Everybody’s been playing pretty much as well as they could possibly be,” Weissbourd said. “It feels good playing on the court with these guys, and even though the freshmen are young, they’ve really stepped up.” 
The Crimson will have a week off before traveling down to NYU and Sacred Hart for two crucial league matches. In the meantime, the team will take a few days to nurse injuries before getting back on the court. 
“We have a lot of injuries, and there are only nine of us,” Weissbourd said. “We’ll take two to three days off and then resume training. NYU is going to be a huge game, and that’s the one team we hate the most.”

All work and no play? Not with Harvard coach Jay Weiss and the Crimson wrestling team. When first told a feature would be written about him in the paper, Weiss chuckled, asking, “Who put you up to this?”Apparently pranks and jokes are common amongst the team, which is not surprising, due to Weiss’s accessible and infectious personality.“I like to have fun, and there are a lot of things we do to promote that,” Weiss said.He brings his team together as a unit, generating relationships on and off the mat.“This year we are especially cohesive,” junior co-captain Louis Caputo said. “We cannot seem to get enough of each other.”Harvard grapplers do not consider wrestling purely individual, nor merely just a team sport, but rather as a family. The Harvard Wrestling Family is a significant theme, if not the central tenet, of Weiss’s program.“The way my personality is…I need it to be close-knit,” Weiss said. “I think the sport dictates that as well, meaning wrestlers are different, and the more close-knit the group is, the team is, the more success you are going to have and the more fun you are going to have.”In the high-intensity atmosphere that surrounds wrestling, it may seem ironic that having fun is a primary concern of the coach. But with 14 All-Americans in 14 seasons—including national champion Jesse Jantzen ’04—under his belt, Weiss seems to have figured out the secret to what makes his athletes and program tick. He is a two-time EIWA Coach of the Year, and before Weiss took the reins of the program, Harvard boasted only seven-All Americans in almost eight decades. “We have a ton of respect for the coaches,” Caputo said. “They are fantastic people to be around. With our team, unlike compared to others, the coaches are mentors but also really close friends.”Weiss is concerned with not only influencing his wrestlers on the mat but also in their lives outside the sport. His program focuses on the growth of individuals through the development of a “family” that transcends the walls of the university. This home away from home has been perpetuated by Weiss throughout his career at Harvard. A vital component of such a program is recruiting the right people.“Character,” Weiss said, “that comes first and Harvard taught me that. You realize that is what you want to coach. I learned that from being here and that is the kind of student-athlete I want to deal with.”Caputo recounted his recruiting process with Weiss, appreciating his upfront attitude and straightforwardness.“He didn’t sugarcoat anything,” Caputo said. “He was honest about the whole process and told me it would be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. And as far as I can tell, he was right.”Weiss’s ability to recruit and cultivate highly motivated and talented athletes like Caputo has been an important aspect of his coaching success. In seven of his 14 years, Crimson grapplers have been named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year. “From day one I have always told a recruit that as an individual sport you can come here and become a national champion, and by the way get the best education in the country,” Weiss says. “And if you do that with enough people, the program is going to keep going.”In his eyes, the willingness and work ethic of each individual are the most important pieces of the puzzle and lay the foundation for a successful program and team. According to Harvard’s mission statement, Crimson wrestling is unique because diverse individual goals combine to advance the common mission of the team. Through wrestling, Harvard grapplers acquire the tools together to face adversity and navigate through life.“Coach Weiss has helped me in pretty much every part of my athletic career,” Caputo said. “He makes sure that if he can’t teach me something, he can find someone who can. He is a general caring guy about not only people in the program, but outside it as well.” Leadership and individual development shape the mission of Harvard wrestling, so in the eyes of his grapplers, Jay Weiss—recipient of the 2007 United States Marine Corps Excellence in Leadership Award—fits the bill better than anyone to lead the growth of this team.

Setting records is not important to sophomore Kate Mills.Mills has enjoyed a tremendous season for Harvard, shattering the school’s top times race after race and qualifying for the 2009 NCAA Championships that take place later this week. Personal successes, however, aren’t the world to her. Instead, Mills cares about how many seconds her teammates are shaving off their personal times and how hard they’re pushing themselves to become better.Rather than promoting her own success, there is nothing that gives Mills more satisfaction than to see her teammates come out on top in their races or to see that they have improved. “It was nice [to break records],” Mills remarked. “But for me it was all about seeing many of my teammates break personal records and becoming better swimmers.”The Sacramento, Calif. native knows that even though swimming can be about personal achievement, at the end of day victories rely on the cumulative success of each member of the team. If one falls, the others need to step up, so it’s no coincidence that Mills enjoys competing in relays.“Kate is the ultimate team player,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said. “She loves to compete in relays because it’s not only her that’s out to win but three of her teammates are also part of the victory.”Team spirit is an essential trait for a top athlete looking to demonstrate leadership, but Mills equally exemplified the importance of resilience this past season.After undergoing knee surgery during the summer for a waterpolo injury she sustained in high school, Mills knew that she had to work hard to recuperate and surpass her level of swimming from last season in a very successful freshman campaign.She was, however, confident that the team could step up during her recovery to ensure that Harvard remained on top in the Ivy League. Mills was extremely careful with her rehabilitation. She met religiously with her strength and conditioning trainers to slowly apply more and more force on her knee to bring her leg back to pristine form.While the team would kick 1000 yards for practice, coach Morawski would only allow Mills to swim 400 yards so that she wouldn’t overexert the fragile joint.Morawski knew it was tough for such a competitive athlete to take baby steps to reach the level she wanted, but the coach felt Mills was taking the right steps in the right direction.“She never pushed it too far, she was very careful,” Morawski commented. “We would always check in on her and [the trainers] would ask her how she was doing. The process helped her leg and she never pushed past a dangerous point. She was right on schedule with predictions from the doctors.”When Mills was cleared to compete, it was still all about a gradual process to reach the high potential she has. Morawski quickly realized that Mills had to switch to events that would better suit her condition.Morawski didn’t allow Mills to swim the individual medleys and instead let her swim freestyle or backstroke.At the beginning of the season, Mills continued to combat the effects of her injury, as she was once forced to start a 500-yard freestyle race in the water instead of the on the diving blocks.Even with this setback, Mills dominated the race and broke the five-minute barrier that eludes many full-strength swimmers. She didn’t let her state interfere with her competitive drive to get another win for Harvard.During the winter campaign, Mills fully recovered from her complication, and started swimming at an extremely high level.Mills began to show signs that she had hit prime form in the Ivy League Championships when she faced-off in the 800-yard relay against extremely tough competition.“Mills really showed what she was capable of at the Ivy League championships,” Morawski recalled. “She held off the top Princeton swimmer who competed in the Olympics. Going against someone who’s in the top eight and who caught up after five laps and still keeping her from overtaking the race was a special moment for Mills.”Her top speed and great swimming form made Mills stand out from the rest. She qualified for the NCAA Championships—taking place at Texas A&M’s Student Rec Center Natatorium in College Station—where she, junior Alexandra Clarke, and Coach Morawski are currently training for the competition.“I think [Clarke and I] are swimming at a really fast pace,” Mills declared. “It’s been fun these past weeks training for the championships. There is a lot of excitement since we have been working hard all season. We’re ready to go.” Mills and Clarke are both seeded 19th in their respective events. Mills hopes to exceed expectations at this competition, but never forgets that her team comes first in her life. “I mean, I hope to go places,” Mills reflected. “My goal is to make top 16 in the NCAA Championships. But most importantly, this team needs to excel so that we can show the country that we really are not only phenomenal students but also phenomenal swimmers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team made sure its opponent never left the doghouse yesterday afternoon, taking down Connecticut, 14-12, in a non-league matchup. The Crimson (3-3, 0-1 Ivy) nearly blew a five-goal halftime lead, but in the end it did just enough to stave off a late charge by the winless Huskies (0-8).“We came out strong, but we didn’t finish the way that we wanted to,” senior Kaitlin Martin said. “We want to be the team that puts them away in the beginning and doesn’t give them any chance to come back.”Harvard’s top two scorers, Martin and sophomore Jess Halpern, once again led the attack with five goals apiece. Martin threw in two assists while Halpern had one, as four of their teammates also got on the scoreboard. Tri-captain Sara Flood and freshman standout Tyler Petropulous each contributed a score and an assist. Husky captain Whitney Michele led all scorers with eight points in the loss, tallying five goals and three helpers.Coming off a disappointing performance Saturday in its Ivy opener, a 12-8 loss at Brown, Harvard was well aware that it needed to make a vast improvement, especially in the game’s first minutes.“Against Brown, we started really slowly…We were down 7-1, and it took us a while to get into our rhythm and play our game,” Halpern said. “We started a lot better today…We had a lot of intensity right from the get go.”Although Connecticut did find the net first, scoring 47 seconds into the game, this time it was Harvard that would jump out to an insurmountable lead. The top scorer in the Ivies, Halpern made a mockery of the Husky defense, garnering a trio of goals to give her team a 3-1 lead through eight minutes of action. A couple of minutes later the hosts pulled back within one, but the Crimson strung together four straight points to solidify the advantage. Petropulous got the party started, sinking her eighth goal of the season on a pass from Martin, who then exploded for two scores of her own. Freshman Chelsey Bowman punctuated the run with her second collegiate goal, putting Harvard ahead, 7-2.The Huskies twice cut the deficit to four, but Martin’s third and fourth goals made it 9-4 with six minutes to play in the half. Two and a half minutes later, freshman Katie Doherty and junior tri-captain Sara Flood scored 11 seconds apart to open up a seven-goal lead for the Crimson, which exhibited a stellar team effort.“Freshmen Tyler Petropulous and Katie Doherty did a great job on the draws today, and that really allows the ball to stay on the offensive end,” Martin said. “People did a good job of finishing as well.”Connecticut scored two goals in the final 1:37 of the half to cut the lead to 11-6. It was an unfavorable conclusion to a fine start by Harvard, which took 23 shots and had six turnovers to the Huskies’ 13 and 11, respectively, in the stanza.The momentum seemed to have permanently shifted the Huskies’ way. Michele pounced on a free position opportunity a minute into the second frame, after which Halpern and Martin notched goals to send the lead back to a margin of six.After another Michele score, Halpern’s free position shot found the back of the net, but the game’s final 19 minutes would be all Huskies, as the home team slowly crawled its way back from a 14-8 disadvantage.The four-goal run to close out the contest brought Connecticut within two, but neither team was able to get on the board following Michele’s goal with 3:39 to play. Freshman goaltender Kerry Clark came up big as Crimson managed to keep its slim lead from dwindling even further—a less than ideal finish that left Harvard with a bittersweet victory.“We didn’t have enough intensity, and [we] played down to the level of our opponent,” Martin said.The Crimson cannot afford do the same at 1 p.m. Saturday, when it takes on nationally-ranked crosstown rival Boston University at Nickerson Field.—Staff writer Dennis J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When sophomore Tyler Albright sits behind the plate calling the pitch, he knows exactly where he wants the ball to end up. Like any good catcher, Albright’s looking for the ball to nestle in his glove for a strike. But if it doesn’t wind up with him, he’s got a couple of classmates ready and waiting to make the play.
“We try to get guys to ground out to Sean [O’Hara]—Sean’s potentially the best shortstop in the northeast,” Albright says. “And if it’s in the air, we want batters to pop out to Dillon [O’Neill]—Dillon can run down everything for us in the outfield.”
With Albright behind the plate, O’Hara at shortstop, and O’Neill patrolling center field, the three sophomores form the backbone of the Harvard baseball team.
“Right now, they are the heart and soul of our team,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh says. “With them up the middle, I just keep thinking that good things are going to happen.”
Albright, O’Hara, and O’Neill burst onto the scene last year as rookies, and very quickly became mainstays in the lineup. Their play was perhaps the one bright spot in Harvard’s 10-30 2008 season.
Adapting to the high level of Division I pitching takes every freshman a great deal of time, and Albright, O’Hara, and O’Neill were no different. But while their bats may have been slightly quiet, the three of them were able to make names for themselves immediately with some outstanding play in the field.
Albright had the highest fielding percentage of any Crimson player (with a minimum of 20 appearances), and he and O’Neill tied for the fewest errors on the squad. O’Hara was moved all around the infield, but was able to provide solid defense wherever he was used. This year, he’s back at home at short.
If there is to be a Harvard resurgence in 2009, the three of them will have a lot to do with it.
In Albright, the Crimson has a backstop with a rocket arm, capable of slowing down even the fastest of teams. The Long Beach, Calif. native has also been lauded for his game-calling skills. 
Walsh recalls his recruiting trip to watch Albright play. He had just spent the entire summer looking for a catcher to bring in, with little success. But in October, he got the chance to see Albright’s Woodrow Wilson High School in action. 
“When you think of a catcher, you think of defense and being able to shut down the running game,” Walsh says. “I saw one inning of Tyler, and I knew he was our guy.”
While Albright’s arm strength stops teams from stealing bases, the same attribute helps O’Hara keep runners off the basepaths altogether. The shortstop has already made some tremendous plays this season, exhibiting a calm demeanor throughout.
“Sean’s very smooth, and he makes plays that are difficult look pretty routine,” O’Neill says. “He never really looks like he’s trying too hard, which inspires confidence in the team.”
On the team’s latest trip down to Florida, legendary Mississippi State coach Ron Polk—now an assistant with UAB—took notice of O’Hara’s nifty glove. 
“Ron, who basically is college baseball for me, goes, ‘I love your shortstop,’” Walsh recounts.
If the ball does find its way out of the infield, the team has total faith in its next line of defense. O’Neill—known for his speed—covers a ton of ground in the outfield.
“Dillon’s a real emotional guy,” Albright says. “On the field he really tries to take control—he’s going to go after a ball in the outfield every time, and anything he can get to, the other outfielders let him take, even if it’s not his ball.”
The three players seem to know each other inside out. Albright and O’Neill are roommates on campus, and O’Neill and O’Hara tend to room together when the team travels. The relationships come full circle on the field, where O’Hara communicates with Albright through signals, helping the catcher deal with runners on base.
The fact that the three sophomores have been counted on for nearly errorless defense so far in 2009 hasn’t shocked anyone. 
But in Harvard’s opening eight games, there has been one unpleasant surprise for its opponents: these guys can hit too.
All three have already developed into serious double-threats in their short Crimson careers. 
The end of last season saw Albright, O’Hara, and O’Neill become more comfortable at the plate. Albright finished with a .370 batting average and a .412 on-base percentage in Ivy games, while O’Hara hit safely in 14 of the team’s final 15 contests. 
O’Neill had always been the prototype leadoff man with his knack for drawing walks and stealing bases, but was also able to increase his batting average by nearly 40 points in league play.
And the three have showed even more improvement with the bat this year. 
O’Neill started the season with a two-hit performance against Jacksonville St., and continues to display the athleticism, patience and speed that make him the first name on Walsh’s lineup card every game.
Meanwhile, Albright has gained 15 pounds and seems to be hitting the ball a lot harder than last season. What’s more, he actually leads the team in runs.
What allows a catcher who hits in the No. 5 spot to lead the team in runs? The Crimson has been getting significant production from the bottom of its order. O’Hara, who has been hitting seventh, is batting .345 on the year.
At the plate and in the field, Albright, O’Hara, and O’Neill have quickly become key components for Harvard. Together, they form a very solid young core up the middle.
“They’ll be the foundation of our baseball team in the next couple of years,” Walsh says.

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you’ll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
One of the seven original houses, Winthrop House has a rich history, sheltering three Kennedy brothers in its heyday. But, as they say, the more things change…the more things change. Winthrop lacks much of its former glamour and desirability. But what it lacks in singles, it makes up for in occasional sewage leaks! Score! (Am I right? Guys? Guys?!)
Location: Sweet suite? With the most riverfront property of any house, Winthrop’s location is definitely a boon. Seniors are basically guaranteed views of the Charles, and Winthrop residents can be found lounging in the courtyards overlooking the river on sunny spring days (all three of them).
Just steps from the MAC and the Charles, Winthrop residents are situated perfectly for a jog beside the river or a quick dip in the swimming pool. For all you night owls and party animals, Winthrop’s doors are located just a hop, skip, and a jump from ’Lipes, ’Nochs, and Stillman Infirmary.
Rooming:  Close your eyes and repeat after me: “At least I have a river view. At least I have a river view.”
Winthrop operates by the motto: "Keep your friends close and your frenemies closer." If you want to get to know your blockmates (and the people through the fire door, and the people those people are sleeping with, etc.), Winthrop is the place to do it. Almost all sophomores live in miniscule doubles, and residents are sometimes forced to squeeze into double bedrooms even during their senior year. But with common rooms in every suite, Winthrop lodging is ideal for forced socialization. Plus, humans bond over trauma, and if murdering a six-inch cockroach in your bedroom isn’t trauma, I don’t know what is. Um…at least you have a river view?
Dining Hall:  Subterranean: an unparalleled. if underground, dining experience. The ID-swiper, Sonia, makes a point to know every Winthropian’s name—and even the names of their most frequent guests. The dining hall stays open 24 hours, drawing problem-set troglodytes and mixer-seeking second-semester seniors  on a nightly basis.
The other drawback to Winthrop’s subterranean dining paradise is that the kitchen has been known to flood…with sewage. For reference, look at the infamous incident of February 2008, which spurred Resident Dean Gregg Peeples to e-mail residents with this solemn warning: “Until things are brought under control, every thing you flush or otherwise send down the drain in our building will end up in the basement.” Gross.  Might as well throw in a mention of that hideous wall sitting right in the middle of the room, too.  Really detracts from the rest of the beauty?  I guess?
House List: Dictatorial. Throptalk is perhaps best known for its tyrannical moderators, who require all posters to introduce themselves with a “fun fact” or risk seeing their message bounced by particularly vehement subscribers. Some people (predominantly tutors) are entertained by this. Most residents simply want to borrow a copy of “10 Things I Hate About You” and move on with their lives.
House Masters:  Freakishly spirited. Masters Stephen P. Rosen ’74 and Mandana Sassanfar bring a maniacal devotion to IM sports (Winthrop is the reigning Straus Cup champion), and weekly Sunday-night Masters’ Open Houses are the kind of gorge-fests that give stress-eating its good name.
Other house administrators of repute are Peeples (mildly terrifying but ultimately harmless), Superintendent David Simms, and Enoch, a Ghanaian table-tennis champion-turned-security guard. Ronald S. Sullivan and Stephanie Robinson were recently selected to assume the duties of House Masters in June, with Rosen and Sassanfar set to step down after a six-year stint at the helm. Sullivan (who met Barack Obama on the basketball court in their HLS days), and Robinson will be the first black couple to serve as House Masters at Harvard, fulfilling Winthrop’s longstanding commitment to diversity (it was the first house to accept Catholics and Jews).
House Culture:  Divided. Some hard-core Winthropians have mystifying Griffin pride, but the majority of the house is blasé about ’Throp culture. Although it plays host to campus “traditions” like Debauchery and Thropstock (the house’s outdoor carnival), Winthrop residents don’t summon a lot of energy for the house on the whole. The exception to this apathy is IM sports. IM victories are frequently broadcast over Throptalk, complete with suggestions that Winthrop’s athletes channel superhuman vigor and inexplicable devotion to sports on a regular basis. Power to them. (You can find me in my common room, summoning superhuman heroism on a regular basis in order to kill a midsize colony of cockroaches that have taken up residence there.)
Overall rating:  Subprime. * There’s only so much that the devoted House Masters, friendly staff, and scarily committed amateur athletes can do to make up for the miniscule bedrooms, scanty house spirit, and (literally) crappy dining hall. Just know that you can eat your tears away on Housing Day when Winthrop lures you to the river with food and beverage. "But really?!" you exclaim. "Worse than Dunster?!! Did any other house actually get a 'subprime”'rating??...BUT WE HAVE RIVER VIEWS!!!"
 Just keep telling yourself that.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
"You don't go looking for it,
It finds you;
You cannot escape it,
It smothers you;
You cannot alter it,
It does not yield,
You cannot confront it,
It does not care;
You cannot cry out for help,
No one can hear you."
~Anonymous
Such is the VOID according to one of our frequent fliers.  We know its tough...but you're oh so close to the end.  Whether it be River Run tomorrow night, or going crazy at Annenberg just a few hours after that, you'll get that release you need.
In the meantime, go through the VOID and beyond with this clay version of The Deathly Hallows, catch up on the freshest dance moves in time for SB, and ponder the joys of crack (a must see!).

As house spirit reaches a crescendo heading into Thursday, a few have gone the extra mile to make videos celebrating the endless virtues of their houses.  All the clips, after the jump.
Mather has been on point with their videos for quite some time now.  So it's of no surprise that they were the first to drop theirs, which is an equal opportunity offender of every house (besides Currier??):

Not to be outdone, Leverett has cooked up a video of its own.  Prominently featuring the Leverett bunny, this 7-minute video covers all its bases:

Next up is Dunster, whose video is...well, let's just say it's in true Dumpster form (you can see where this one's going) who took down their initial attempt...again, we'll reference what will probably be their best bet:

Though not officially sanctioned from the HoCo, there was even some fledgling Winthrop spirit (don't know why), courtesy of The Harvard Hooligans:

Yeah...that was a picture of Leverett at the end, but who's counting.  Finally, Eliot has a little piece of propaganda of its own, staging a dramatic battle with Kirkland for all the freshman in Annenberg to see:

The battle ends in part 2, with a victory for the mighty Domus.  FlyBy is absolutely loving the house spirit all around...but we follows the motto that you play to win the game. Who came out on top?

As Housing Day approaches, FlyBy will serve as your personal rating agency with a complete rundown by a resident of each House. Not that you have any say (River Gods notwithstanding), but at least you’ll know whether your portfolio is getting a downgrade.
Somewhere, in a land known among common folk as “the Quad,” there is a House called Cabot. Trouble is, no one’s quite certain of where that fabled complex lies, and few other than its mostly anonymous residents have actually been there.
Location: Anyone? Ironically, although Cabot buildings surround three quarters of the Quad yard, most visitors automatically assume they’re at Pfoho and couldn’t point to Cabot it they tried.
Rooming: One word – hype. Caboteers convince themselves on Housing Day that the mythic spatial bounty of Cabot’s rooms will amply compensate for the erstwhile frustration of Quad life. In reality, it’s those (rare) days spent sunning in the yard that make it okay that the River deities chose not to smile on your blocking group.
The truth about rooming is that most rising sophomores looking for a single next year will get one. Before you pee yourself, though, consider: communal bathrooms (with spotty shower-curtain coverage), no party space on your floor (or in your building, for that matter), and the likelihood that you’ll be living adjacent to someone who’s either genuinely crazy (or a sex maniac) might deflate your excitement.  Upperclassmen have more to look forward to, as Cabot has a wide variety of spacious suites. But with an interior design scheme conceivably chosen by former resident Helen Keller, Cabot’s social spaces leave much to be desired.
Dining Hall: Geriatric. Cabot, its dining space marked by a horrific “retirement home” ambiance, impresses as Havard’s most reliable example of d-hall fail. And while the staff always manages to maintain a chipper demeanor, it’s rarely enough to kick the feeling that you’re eating in Pfoho’s afterthought of a basement.
Also, don’t count on Cabot’s brain-break to satisfy your p.m. hunger. A penchant for frenzied mutilation must run strong in Cabot’s veins, because by 9:30/10, what’s left on the snack table is typically little more than crust-less scraps of bread and the wrangled remains of what was once a cupcake. 
House List: Cabot-open, while generally confined to activity-related spam, is nonetheless the venue of several heated threads each semester. Recent debates have pitted tutors Fiery Cushman ’03 against Sam Lipoff over whether batteries are safely disposable, as well as sparking public admonitions on the part of some residents of other Caboteers’ smoking/incense habits. 
House Masters: After a six-year tenure as Masters, Jay and Cheryl Harris have certainly carved out a perfect place in Cabot life. The couple feels as comfortable joining students for dinner as they do welcoming them into their home for the frequent Open Houses, which Cheryl is known to provision with baked goods of her own creation. House administrator Susan Livingston is the lovable director of Cabot’s storied theater program, and superintendent Mike Russell is the ever-patient warden of Cabot’s physical facilities. In a House where the Masters know every student by name, the administrative staff is a definite strong point. 
House Culture: Periodic. Bi-monthly Stein clubs and Open Houses aside, let’s get down to the meat of the matter – Cabot’s residents don’t really spend too much time cultivating House culture. Don’t get me wrong, 63 Linnaean is home to a colorful variety of folks – Powerade-downing bros, Pudding members, and everyone in between – but many of Cabot’s more interesting spaces (a darkroom?!?) remain empty.
What’s more, Cabot’s main House-wide party, Mardi Gras, pales in comparison to those thrown by neighboring Currier and Pfoho. This year, the event attracted more security staff and bartenders than students – I guess Chex-mix and DJ Strauss no longer pull in the crowd they used to. 
The Verdict: Junk.* Cabot may fall short of the spirit of some River Houses, and lacks the party reputation that Currier has so carefully cultivated, but it offers a peaceful, reliable shelter from the bustle of Harvard Square proper. Whether that’s enough to offset the many missed shuttles caused by the dining hall’s erratic digital shuttle schedule is a question with which new residents will be forced to grapple…

“We’ve been in touch with proctors to tell them to be aware of any shenanigans the night before housing day,” Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 warned in a recent interview.
Shenanigans? Housing Day Eve? FlyBy was intrigued. From whence did this the ritualistic traditions of “River Run” stem? “The notion of appealing to the gods for special attention to their [freshmen’s] wishes has really surfaced in the last couple years,” said Dingman. But, of course, we wanted to know more. Who was the first Harvardian to supplicate himself before the river gods in hopes of avoiding the quad…and Dunster…and Mather…yes even Mather though this is sweet.
A little archival research and some phone calls and here you have it, the history of “River Run," after the jump:
In 1995, Harvard College Dean L. Fred Jewett '57 introduced full randomization of the housing process to avoid the increasingly non-diverse student groupings. Students could choose a maximum of 16 students to block with, but could no longer request to be in a particular house; in other words, fate was introduced to the housing process. William F. Abely ’99, Bill, now an attorney in Boston, and his blocking group would become the first to perform a sacrificial rite the night before housing day.
“I don’t know where the genesis for the idea came from but we ended up taking our plant from PBHA sale at the beginning of the year and brought it down to the Weeks foot bridge, doused it in Jack Daniels and lit it on fire and dumped it over the edge of the bridge and hoped for the river,” said Abely. An original incantation was read facing Leverett House. The blocking group ended up in a Leverett suite overlooking the river.
Abely passed the tradition down to his friend, Adam G. Kosberg ’00, currently a filmmaker in L.A.  Kosberg and his group, choosing Jim Beam instead of Jack Daniels, introduced their own spin on the ritual. Using the same incantation and standing on Weeks Bridge, the group set aflame two voodoo dolls of blocking mates who had dropped out of the group last minute, as well as various remnants of old girlfriends. Kosberg and group were placed in Leverett as well. Fate? We don’t think so.
After Kosberg the history of River Run becomes fuzzy. Kosberg said he passed down the ritual to a fellow student in HRTV. But in 2001 the tradition seemed to disappear for a year, to resurface in recent years with minor additions and metamorphose. However, in 1997 the Crimson published an article publishing Kosberg’s exploits, so in our small way, Flyby and The Crimson would like to think that we have contributed to the posterity of this most excellent tradition.
What should you do tonight?  All FlyBy can tell you is that the River Gods are a fickle bunch.  Perhaps you show the proper contrition, and give sacrifices worthy of their praise, you may avoid a most terrible fate. But please, don't get too carried away.
