To celebrate the release of Billie Eilish’s new James Bond theme song, “No Time To Die,” here’s a definitive ranking of the top five Bond themes, from rock bangers to orchestral classics.
5. “The World Is Not Enough” by Garbage
Rock band Garbage’s take on the Bond theme for “The World Is Not Enough” (1999) follows many conventions of the traditional Bond song subgenre, such as the song’s commanding orchestral opening, but is set apart by Shirley Manson’s brooding, lilting vocals and an undeniable ‘90s alt-rock influence. The song is ominous and beckons you to lose yourself in its angst-filled lyrics, all while echoing the established musicality of other Bond themes.
4. “Goldfinger” by Shirley Bassey
Shirley Bassey is the quintessential Bond singer and “Goldfinger” (1964), the best of her three contributions to the franchise, is the quintessential Bond song. The track features a booming orchestral section that still doesn’t overpower Bassey’s vocals as she belts out lyrics about Mr. Goldfinger and his kiss of death. The song’s strongest quality is Bassey’s voice, which croons sultrily above the classic instrumentation we’ve come to associate with the Bond theme.
3. “Skyfall” by Adele
Probably the best-known Bond theme, Adele’s track for “Skyfall” (2012) checks all the boxes — powerful vocals that take influence from Bassey, a signature orchestral section, and nonsensical lyrics scrambling to match the film title — though its chart success could be attributed to Adele’s own popularity at the time. Still, the song breaks free from the genre’s bounds to become a certified earworm and the first Bond theme to secure an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
2. “No Time To Die” by Billie Eilish
Eilish’s haunting vocals on the theme for the upcoming Bond film, “No Time to Die,” are painfully beautiful from start to finish. Though the song features the lulling harmonies characteristic of Eilish’s music, the underlying piano melody, whirling strings, and powerful orchestral bridge of the song are reminiscent of past Bond staples, giving the genre of the Bond theme a modern edge.
1. “Live and Let Die” by Paul McCartney & Wings
The theme song for “Live and Let Die” (1973) has been an iconic powerhouse and cultural mainstay since its release, and it’s no surprise why. McCartney’s piano ballad turned rock n’ roll banger is one of his best songs with Wings, and its lyricism and musicality are unmatched in the realm of Bond themes. It was the first rock song to be used as a theme in a James Bond film — and the only one whose lyrics make some semblance of sense. The song is infectious, energizing, and timeless beyond its connection to Bond, making it a clear ringer for number one on this list.

Over the long run of Netflix’s first animated series, “Bojack Horseman,” the show touched on the both difficult and fun topics of life: sex, drugs, alcohol, substance dependence, love, mistakes, and facing fear, to name a few. The show, although certainly an adult cartoon, brought to the forefront important and essential conversational topics that had been taboo in animated shows for far too long.
The rampant destruction caused by Horseman's inability to confront his own inner demons permeated the show. Horseman himself, voiced by Will Arnett, was a difficult character to watch at times: he could be deeply flawed, manipulative, and wholly apathetic. The topics consistently felt relevant and the delivery packed a punch. Despite the constant malaise caused by Horseman, the show was always intrinsically good, incredibly entertaining, and simply human — even though it featured an anthropomorphic horse as its protagonist.
Sadly, the final half of the last season forgets almost all of what made “Bojack Horseman” great. Given the doom that has slowly encroached on this beloved yet despised centaur-adjacent caricature, expectations for the show’s final installments were not high.
In the episode titled, “That’s Too Much, Man!” from Season Three, in a bender after losing his grip on reality, Horseman ripped Sara Lynn, voiced by Kristen Schaal, out of sobriety and into a cocaine, alcohol, and prescription pill-fueled spiral. As this episode ended, so did the life of Sarah Lynn. The bender — which left Horseman with only a headache — resulted in the tragic loss of the life of the one person he believed he could love, the one person with whom he could be a friend. The severity of this situation and Horseman’s incredulous dodging of its consequences continued for almost three full seasons. In the final season, the audience and Horseman alike deserved and needed closure for this and all other terrible acts. For what would be the first and only time, Horseman needed to understand the consequences of his most deeply hidden, secret mistake. He had to face the light about what he did to Sarah Lynn. Horseman had to grapple with the true significance of his action and his crippling sense of guilt.
Instead, in the final two episodes of Season Six, Horseman again got off the hook without addressing any of his issues. After the death of Sarah Lynn became public, he apologized and received praise for being a man willing to own up to his actions, talk to her family, and shed light on the difficulty of addiction. He couldn’t stop there, though. After the praise and the fame he received for coming clean, he chose to stay in the spotlight. Accordingly, the darkest parts of his past were laid bare for all to see. This washed-up horse actor with the potential to make amends and move forward in a positive way instead chose to succumb to his narcissism.
Horseman, forced to confront his mistakes in front of the world, instead decided, in his usual way, to address his issues through alcohol and drug abuse. He broke into the mansion he was forced to sell in bankruptcy and overdosed on pills, vodka, and pool water. In the incredible penultimate episode, deep in Horseman’s unconscious mind as he came to terms with the deaths of the many people no longer in his life, it seemed as if Horseman was finally reconciling his mistakes. Sadly, just as he was beginning to let go of all the deaths and struggles of his life, Horseman woke up in the hospital. He finally made amends for his wrongs. For the first time, he accepted his flaws.
In these last moments, Bojack Horseman should have died. Drowning in his own pool, finally living up to his failures, and cementing the many dangers of self-loathing and addiction shown throughout the show’s run would have been the perfectly destructive end to a beautifully broken show. But instead, he once again failed to face the consequences of his actions. In the final episode, Horseman fell back into his old habits and ended the show as he began it, on the roof smoking a cigarette with Diane.
By choosing to allow Horseman to never learn and never face his reality, by ending one of the greatest of Netflix’s original shows 29 minutes too late — four minutes and one episode — the show lost its touch. “Bojack Horseman” was a powerful series about meaningful topics. Its last two episodes don’t do it justice. As sad as it is to say, the titular character should have died in his pool, dealing with the consequences of his deeply flawed life at its only fitting end.

“Thirty-nine days! Twenty people! One survivor!” The iconic tagline was heard nationwide on Feb. 12 as “Survivor” kicked off its 40th season: “Winners at War.” Only the fifth all-star season in its 20-year history, “Winners at War” sees 20 former champions return to compete for the title of Sole Survivor and the two million dollar prize that goes with it.
“Survivor” is a game based on relationships, usually between strangers coming together to control the weekly vote. The fact that this cast comprises all winners complicates things immensely — not only do the castaways know how their tribemates competed on their winning seasons, but many have become friends outside of the game (two competing winners, Amber and Rob Mariano, even got married following their flagship seasons). Being part of a duo can be a blessing or a curse on “Survivor,” usually depending on how well the players can downplay their bond. In that regard, Jeremy Collins and Natalie Anderson are an interesting test case.
Both players began their “Survivor” journey in Season 29, where they immediately formed a tight friendship. Anderson went on to win the season, while Collins returned just one year later for a second chance and pulled off a unanimous victory. Now both “Survivor” champions, Collins and Anderson were placed on the blue “Sele” tribe and returned with huge targets on their back for their in-game and post-game friendship. When Sele lost the first immunity challenge, splitting up the power couple became the primary goal of the group: Anderson became the first castaway voted off the island in a 7-2-1 vote.
Counterintuitively, it seems that lacking a prior connection to fellow tribe mates will be a big advantage this season. On the red “Dakal” tribe, Yul Kwon, winner of the 13th season, was quickly able to put an alliance together between himself and tribe mates Sophie Georgina Clarke, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland, predicated on the fact that they’re not closely tied to any other players. Much like Anderson, Amber Mariano soon found herself in a tricky spot — having her husband on the island essentially serves as neon “VOTE ME OUT” sign. And not 40 minutes later she faced the same fate as Anderson, becoming the first player voted off of her tribe with six votes.
If you're new to “Survivor,” it might be intimidating to jump right into an “all winners” season. The tangled web of relationships both inside and outside of the game might be difficult to grasp right away, but stick with it — the show does a great job at getting new viewers up to speed on the relationship dynamics of the contestants. Clips from prior seasons and expository confessionals quickly and effectively convey the depth of the various relationships and, more importantly, how these relationships will impact this season. Veteran viewers quickly find that they cannot take past relationships for granted; despite spending 36 days together as island mentors to a new cast just last season, any presumptions of an alliance between Rob and Sandra Diaz-Twine are quickly dashed. Sandra, currently “Survivor”’s only two-time winner, spearheaded the move to blindside his wife.
The gameplay this season promises to be cutthroat. The $2 million cash prize — upped from the usual $1 million and now the largest grand prize in reality show history — seems to be a major factor: “It’s $2 million. I mean, that in itself will cause a lot of people to just do anything,” Sandra Diaz-Twine said moments before the second vote. “And if friends have to be lost along the way, then I think it’s a price every single person out here will be willing to pay.” Survivor’s 40th season is a welcome return for this long running reality competition, whose brutal conditions and ruthless gameplay ensure its continued relevance. Thirty-nine days! Twenty people! Who will be the Sole Survivor?

On her recent Boston stop for the “A Black Woman Created This” tour, two-time Grammy nominee Rapsody owned The Sinclair’s stage. Rapsody, who hails from Snow Hill, North Carolina, made a name for herself collaborating with artists like 9th Wonder, Mac Miller, and Kendrick Lamar, ultimately signing with Jay-Z’s label Roc Nation and earning two Grammy nominations for her 2017 album, “Laila’s Wisdom.” She shined during the Feb. 7 concert, where her smooth flow and incredibly powerful raps showcased her unique style and left a lasting impression on Boston.
Dutch ReBelle, a Boston-based rapper, opened the night, energizing the crowd while keeping it personal and even giving out her phone number at the end of her act. Then Heather Victoria came onstage with smoother vocals and high-pitched notes, belting out R&B songs that complemented Dutch ReBelle’s hard-hitting raps. Most captivating of all was Sa-Roc, a veteran rapper whose relaxed presence, combined with her rapid-fire words, kept listeners at the edge with spillover rhymes and intricate wordplay.
All three openers warmed the stage for Rapsody who, after a few minutes of suspense, waltzed out in an oversized white windbreaker and baggy camouflage pants and jumped into action before the dim red lights could illuminate her face. She asserted her power with “Nina,” the first song on her album “Eve,” and declared to the Sinclair, “Emit light, rap, or Emmet Till / I drew a line without showing my body, that’s a skill.” With tenacity and spunk in each word and step, she moved back and forth from the stage not just as a performer, but as a woman with something to say. She kept the energy alive with “Cleo” and “Whoopi,” two more songs from “Eve” that allowed her to address her status in the music industry and her strength throughout her ordeals.
With a now-energized crowd, she slowed down and introduced the “A Black Woman Created This” tour, a smile in her voice as she acknowledged the accomplished women that headed every aspect of her show. The theme was all the more prevalent considering that “Eve” is dedicated to black women she admires, each individual track named after one of her idols. As the performance went on, she continued to balance pride in her own ability with respect for her heroes.
Throughout the concert, Rapsody performed incredible songs from her past albums like “Pay Up,” where she highlighted the injustice of a male gold digger preying on independent women, a reversal of the roles usually seen in rap songs. The inflections and irony in her voice were clear as she lamented, “Thought your love one day would help him grow up / But, he just want a baby girl that he know can / Pay up,” and she animated the song the way only a live performer can. Using an almost bitter tone and high-powered bounces and movements, she both expressed her scorn for the male lover and seemed to connect these feelings to frustration with the hip hop industry’s general disregard for women in their ranks.
As a rapper who is unafraid to credit her role models, Rapsody also spent a lot of her performance honoring women like Lauryn Hill, Maya Angelou, and Aaliyah for their legacy and impact. In one segment of the concert, Rapsody invited a (single) man to come onstage and delivered a tribute to Hill as she performed Hill’s cover of “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” for him. She continued to take him on a journey of love, singing songs like “Rollercoaster Jam Called Love” and dancing with him onstage as she expressed hope about a budding romance through her fluid movements and aptly worded verses. In the end, he left the stage so that she could leave the crowd with a powerful reminder to put self-love above all, and ended the show’s three-part depiction of love with “Maya,” an empowering song performed with gusto and pride.
Rapsody remained as potent and compelling throughout the rest of her concert. Sometimes, she’d strip the music from the song and perform her raps like spoken word, each line clear, punctuated, and meaningful. Other times, she’d hype up the crowd with call and response phrases, like “Can I kick it y’all?” taken from the prolific rap group A Tribe Called Quest, exciting the crowd and paying homage to her roots. In one of the rare moments of quiet, Rapsody addressed her fans and said, “I’m just a reflection of you and a reflection of what I see, so I appreciate you for the inspiration.” With conviction and passion, Rapsody’s “A Black Woman Created This” tour was a tribute to the people before her, a thank you to the people with her now, and a promise for an even greater future.

Perhaps there really is no such thing as a free lunch. After running out of funding for the rest of the year, Classroom to Table — a popular program that subsidizes meals for College undergraduates and their professors in Harvard Square — is now “on hiatus” for the remainder of the spring semester. The program, which started in 2015, has been suspended mid-semester each term between spring 2018 and spring 2019, and its future direction is now under review.
Since its inception, we have been extremely supportive of Classroom to Table for providing a non-academic setting in which students and faculty can get to know each other on a more intimate level. Though exchanges during class and office hours are no doubt productive and meaningful, they are often restricted to dissecting readings or planning upcoming assignments. In contrast, dinner conversations are more comfortable and friendly, enabling students to form personal relationships with professors who they may otherwise only see in the half-light of the academic’s reading lamp.
The persistent shortage of funds demonstrates that students and in turn the faculty they invite recognize the value and joy of these meals. As such, in putting the program on hold — and stronger still under review — the College sends a sort of mixed message about the relationships and forms of engagement they want to promote and their ultimate willingness to make them financially possible. Our conclusion, if simplistic, is that Harvard should, for lack of a better phrase, pony up.
Still more, a sustainable solution to this constant funding problem would seem to also involve creating other forums to fill what is obviously a void in personal engagement between faculty and students. One idea would be to increase the number of faculty dinners in Annenberg and the Houses, which would seem to be more cost-efficient as well as inclusive.
But we’d also like to make an appeal to faculty members themselves. Of course, we understand that as leaders in their fields — not to mention family members, friends, and private persons — Harvard faculty balance busy schedules. And we want to acknowledge the incredible dedication so many faculty members show to their students. But it’s worth remembering that, as teachers, faculty have a critical responsibility — and we’d hope, given the caliber, not to mention charm, of students here, desire — to get to know their students as people. It’s the sort of practice that seems to be done best at small liberal arts colleges, but that need not prevent the same from happening here.
The fight for programs like Classroom to Table should not be taken up by students alone. A faculty-student meal should be a pleasure and privilege on both sides of the table.

The Hong Kong International Airport is a good half an hour away from the center of Hong Kong Island, even on the airport express, the direct train between the busy city and the busy airport. Whenever I come back from the States, after a semester of school and after a 15-hour flight back, I board that airport express, headed towards home. During the ride, I look out the window and glimpse the familiar scenes. There is the Tsing Ma Bridge with its suspending cables that twinkle at night, the cargo docks that operate even at the early hours when my flight lands, and right before the terminal stop, the station which a few of my friends live right above. When the train passes, I send a text to say “hi.”
It feels like I am back in my whole past world, a dazzling place that I have always known, as if the entire horizon is painted in a nostalgic mix of sepia tones. In fact, every time I come home, I do the things that I have always enjoyed doing: visit the restaurants that my mum and I love, play football (soccer) with my interclass team, hang out with friends in Causeway Bay, and stay up at sleepovers, squeezing every minute of the night into Alex Hunter’s FIFA career. At some moments, when I happen to forget about choosing classes on my.harvard.edu, logging on my college email, and checking the buzzing notifications from my friends in the United States, I almost feel like I have never left.
Don’t get me wrong — I enjoy my classes (not so much checking emails) and really appreciate the friends that I have gotten to know and rely on at Harvard. I do feel like I belong at this place. Maybe you think that I am still lonely on the inside and simply do not dare to admit it. But I know what it feels like to be at home, and I feel that way when I am at Harvard with my friends and in Hong Kong with my friends and family.
So what is this strange feeling that I cannot seem to shake off? On the first few nights back home, I always get jet-lagged at 3 or 4 a.m. As my phone lights up with messages from my U.S. friends, the city is softly asleep. I can stare out the window and see yellow street lights on empty roads, dark figures of highrises cast against the sky, and the occasional apartment light that stays on throughout the night. At that time, I feel the rift between two parts of my life, the two places that I call home. Like a secret agent, I live my double lives, with only so many insiders who are in on my secrets and can understand both worlds.
They say you get a chance to start anew at college, that no one knows who you were, so you get to press the reset button and reinvent yourself. Even the first prompt from the First-Year Experience Office’s Journal Project asked, “What parts of your pre-Harvard self do you choose to leave behind?” But why should I leave a part of myself behind? How can I distance myself from the past that has brought me to where I am, from the friends and family who have witnessed my baby steps and giant strides, and most of all, from my own self? And even if I choose not to leave behind parts of myself, how do I reconcile the new parts with the old?
It is no secret that Harvard “transforms” you, from the way you dress to the way you act and talk. But any experience, by definition, changes you. So I guess this feeling of change is just a natural occurrence that I should and will eventually get used to.
But even as I grow accustomed to Lyft’s designation of 945 Memorial Drive as “Home” and get closer to changing my Facebook cover photo, taken a few years ago when my friends and I sat by the reservoir after an afternoon of biking, I am still tightly holding onto the people and things I belong with and adapting to the distant parts of my life.

What is political correctness? To some it is a key reason why the Democrats lost their way and the 2016 election. Others argue that it is a right-wing fiction, a means to rile up the base against an imaginary enemy. Political correctness hasn’t featured prominently in discussions thus far, but as the Democratic primary progresses, it is fairly likely that it will make a reappearance in pundit discussions of 2020, especially if the Democrats lose again. Within Harvard at least, political correctness is more than a phantasmic foe. It is how, despite the diverse backgrounds and ambitions of the greater Harvard community, most come to abide by a consensus view about what is acceptable, especially in public conversation.
In fact, taking Harvard as its own miniature society with a distinct culture, political correctness is a testament to Edmund Burke’s arguments about the positive power of prejudice, whereby our unconscious and instantaneous acts are really a reflection of accumulated societal wisdom and virtue. The ability to immediately recognize politically “incorrect” phrases and react to them, even with humor, presupposes the existence of common norms and beliefs about what is correct.
Yet our miniature society is not completely separate from the outside world. I believe that political correctness has become a needlessly charged topic in society outside of the Harvard bubble partially because of the values that belie the state of political correctness within it. We promote a divisive emphasis on retributive justice and neglect the value of dignity rooted in common humanity.
Within the framework of retributive justice, individuals see themselves as moral agents obligated to restore or create a moral equilibrium. This justice encourages a Manichean conception of moral action: corruption of the moral equilibrium is attributed to the deliberate actions of evil groups (the billionaires, the WASPs, the privileged) and institutions (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and now The Crimson). Individualized examples of actual wrongdoing only typify this mentality. Jeffrey E. Epstein and Harvey Weinstein are not viewed as flawed individuals but as manifestations of latent, structural injustice.
Crucially, this sense of justice is not limited to political correctness. If anything, other examples of societies motivated primarily by a sense of justice — such as the one which animated multiple generations of Christian crusades — provide a worrisome model of how an overemphasis on justice promotes a virtue of zealotry. If the world is divided into “us” and “them'', virtue is calling out and challenging the injustices perpetrated by “them”, especially where injustice is least obvious. The overall culture, however, especially among the apathetic, is one of reluctance or even fearful compliance to an ever-expanding set of norms of what is politically correct. Thus a culture of political correctness rooted only in justice, that attempts to address fundamental societal issues of inequality, will fail on its own terms. The more that one describes a looming threat and berates others for their insensitivity and lack of acknowledgment, the more one alienates potential allies to combat this very threat of an all-consuming, immoral “them”.
The more persuasive grounding for a culture of political correctness is one which recognizes a dignity in each individual. This dignity is not dependent on the status of the individual as a moral agent who identifies and combats evil, but stems from a mutual recognition of human weakness. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a victim of some of the greatest acts of institutional oppression perpetrated against an entire people, still wrote after his experiences that “the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” This conception of humanity is not a coping mechanism nor an idealistic fantasy, but a necessity for change. “The really terrible thing,” writes James Baldwin to his nephew, is that “you must accept them and accept them with love. For these ‘innocent’ people have no other hope.”
One might argue that this degree of love expects too much out of victims or detracts from the original impetus of justice, but I disagree. Solzhenitsyn and Baldwin were writing even as they lived under institutions of oppression, and still were capable of critiquing these dehumanizing, oppressive institutions while acknowledging the humanity of their oppressors. The recognition of the dignity of others is the best display of one’s own. This moral standard set by Solzhenitsyn and Baldwin is high, but that is where Burke’s prejudice works to make up for our deficiencies. The mechanics of prejudice work to transform an ideal of virtue into a reality of action as we are both agents and objects of change.
A politically correct society can still strive towards retributive justice, but this justice ought to be dependent on and tempered by a conception of individual dignity. If virtue within this society is acknowledging the dignity of others, then culture is one of constant mutual encouragement and self-examination, because no one's virtue is guaranteed.
To the reader eminently concerned with social justice, I thank you for reading this far. I also challenge you to take Baldwin and recognize the flawed individual humanity of not just those most downtrodden and oppressed by society, but also of its most powerful and privileged members.

Scientists at Harvard and Columbia released a study examining the structures and cooling mechanisms of butterfly wings, with possible implications for construction and aeronautical engineering.
The paper, published at the end of last month, reported the presence of a “wing heart” that pumps hemolymph — a circulating fluid equivalent to blood in insects — through butterfly wings, providing evidence that these wings are living, dynamic systems.
Naomi E. Pierce, a Harvard professor of biology and co-author of the paper, said that while previous research had identified wing hearts in the thorax of insects, the study found them in a formerly undescribed location.
“This wing heart was right smack in the middle of the wing,” Pierce said.
Nanfang Yu, a professor of applied physics at Columbia University and co-author of the study, wrote in an email that the research team hypothesizes butterflies have cooling mechanisms to protect their wings.
“Butterfly wings have intrinsically poor thermodynamic properties: given their small thermal capacity, wings can overheat rapidly in the sun to physiologically disastrous high temperatures,” Yu wrote. “Our thermodynamic experiments show that the wings of living butterflies in the sun can reach a peak temperature as high as 60 degrees Celsius within 10 seconds.”
Yu added that butterflies had adapted to reduce solar absorption in near-infrared light and emit more heat at dynamic parts of the wing. Alongside these physical mechanisms, the study also described several behavioral adaptations of butterflies that help keep their wings cool.
“In an experiment, we locally heated up the living regions of the wings of living butterflies using a small laser spot,” Yu wrote. “All species tested responded with specialized behaviors to prevent overheating of their wings. Some flap their wings, some turn around, and others walk away from the laser spot.”
Cheng-Chia Tsai, a graduate student at Columbia and lead author of the study, said these cooling processes are crucial to butterflies, as overheating the wings impeded their capabilities.
“The butterfly wing started to become insensitive,” Tsai said. “They don’t feel the temperature anymore. So this means overheating will damage the sensors, which includes the mechanical sensors.”
Pierce said the findings from the study are already being applied towards the making of a new type of paint that is similar to butterfly wing nanostructures and forms “little bubbles” as it dries. When used in a building, the paint cut down costs of air-conditioning by 30 percent, according to Pierce.
Yu wrote that the results of the study can also provide insights for airplane wing construction.
“The sensory networks discovered in the wings certainly provide us a lesson that the design of the wings of flying machines should not be solely based on considerations of aerodynamics,” Yu wrote. “Maybe we can create bioinspired, robust, and multifunctional sensory networks for airplane wings that can detect the external environment and the internal state of the wing, and provide a real-time fail-safe against failure of individual elements in the network.”

Within Harvard’s gates, the University maintains its own police force with all the powers of a municipal department — but in many cases, when a call comes in about a crime on campus, officers from that department may not be the only responders.
According to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick and Harvard University Police Department Steven G. Catalano, HUPD and CPD maintain a close, long-standing relationship in Cambridge. Both departments have assisted each other in the past, splitting their jurisdiction based on location and property ownership.
“There is a pretty lengthy relationship in terms how far we go back and a strong relationship between the two agencies,” Warnick said in an interview Monday.
HUPD officers are appointed as special state police officers by the Colonel of the Massachusetts State Police pursuant to Massachusetts General Law. The statute grants HUPD officers the authority to make arrests as regular police officers, granting them authority over land and buildings owned, used, or occupied by the University.
CPD, on the other hand, possesses primary authority over the city of Cambridge, including its schools, campuses, businesses and state roadways, Warnick said.
He added that in certain areas across Cambridge, other agencies — including the Transit Police, Massachusetts state police, and other universities’ police departments — may have primary authority.
“If an incident occurs on Memorial Drive, for example, the agency that has primary jurisdiction over that is the state police,” he said. “If an incident occurs in the Red Line, or with a MBTA bus, the Transit Police have primary jurisdiction over that.”
If incidents take place off campus but involve Harvard affiliates, HUPD will call in neighboring police departments, including CPD, according to Catalano.
“Depending on where they are and what else is occurring on campus officers may respond to their location directly or assist them in connecting with the appropriate jurisdiction,” Catalano wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday.
Warnick added that, when protests and demonstrations take place, CPD has set plans for a variety of “contingencies” in which it might assist HUPD.
“We're always looking to ensure the first amendment rights are being honored by those that are involved, but then also ensuring the safety and security of the area in which these are taking place,” he said. “If those protests, say, for example, became violent, for whatever reason, or became disruptive in a sense that they started to block traffic, you're now on campus, you're now on city property. And now it's becoming a much greater incident.”
CPD may also step in when departments such as HUPD require additional assistance or resources for a particular response, according to Warnick. For instance, he said that if smaller departments like HUPD receive a report of a bomb threat, CPD will assist with its specialized bomb squad as well as its canines unit.
In December, CPD assisted with security during the graduate student union’s strike, billing the University $185,000.
HUPD also occasionally returns the favor, collaborating with other local police departments to ensure “the most appropriate response” to incidents near campus, per its annual security report. For instance, in September 2019, HUPD assisted Cambridge police officers in arresting 12 people protesting at Amazon’s Kendall Square office over the company’s ties to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Campus Christian group Harvard College Faith and Action continues to receive funding from the non-profit organization Christian Union, despite the College’s Feb. 2018 statement that HCFA must disaffiliate from its “parent ministry” to remain a recognized student group.
Current HCFA co-presidents Mattia A. Mah’moud ’20 and Allen Y. Lai ’20 wrote in an emailed statement that Christian Union currently provides them with office space, food, and scholarships for retreats, as well as full-time and part-time staff “who serve as spiritual mentors and advisors to students."
Christian Union’s tax filings show that the organization gave HCFA a sum of $796,180 between July 2017 and June 2018.
That period overlaps with the year-long “administrative probation” which the College imposed on HCFA in Feb. 2018. The decision to place HCFA on probation came following the resignation of a bisexual assistant Bible course leader who said HCFA leadership pressured her to step down after learning of her same-sex relationship.
Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in a statement at the time that, in order to reverse its probationary status, HCFA would have to demonstrate compliance both with Harvard’s non-discrimination policies and with “stated expectations regarding local governance” — namely the requirement that student groups maintain “local autonomy.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in another Feb. 2018 statement that HCFA would need to sever ties with Christian Union in order to regain recognition from the College at the end of the probation.
At the time, Christian Union — a national organization that bankrolls religious groups at all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford — provided HCFA with financial support and “ministry fellows” to lead Bible study courses.
HCFA’s probation concluded in March 2019, and the club was restored to its regular recognized status, despite its last pair of co-presidents acknowledging that HCFA continued to be “resourced” by Christian Union.
Dane declined to comment on behalf of the Dean of Students Office on Christian Union’s continued funding of HCFA in a Wednesday email.
Christian Union’s website lists six full-time staff members as part of its Harvard-based team. The organization’s 2017-2018 tax filings do not include the salaries of its Harvard staff, though they list the salaries of its highest-paid employees, such as former Columbia University ministry director Lane Young, who earned $130,717 in that fiscal year.
Mah’moud and Lai maintained that, despite the presence of these six advisors, HCFA is autonomous in its policy-making decisions.
"HCFA is happy to accept outside support just like many other organizations on Harvard’s campus. HCFA is a student-led organization — students have made and continue to make all policy decisions,” they wrote in an email Wednesday.
Don Weiss, Christian Union’s director of undergraduate ministry at Harvard, reiterated the point.
“HCFA leaders make all policy decisions,” he wrote in a Wednesday email.
Mah’moud and Lai did not directly answer questions as to whether HCFA made changes to its policies on its expectations for leaders during or after their probation period.
“Our leadership standards are commensurate with the standards of other devout religious, moral, and ethical communities on our campus. We are a fully recognized student organization in good standing with the college,” they wrote in a follow-up email Thursday.
The Crimson reported in May 2018 that former Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis allegedly told a group of undergraduates in a private meeting that the College was reticent to sanction HCFA because Harvard did not want to be perceived as waging war on Christianity.

Rahul J. Mehrotra has been appointed chair of the Harvard Graduate School of Design’s Department of Urban Planning and Design, the Design School announced last week.
Mehrotra was also appointed the John T. Dunlap Professor in Housing and Urbanization at the Design School. He will assume both roles in July.
He is succeeding Urban Design Professor Alex Krieger, who served as interim chair while Regional Planning and Urbanism Professor Diane E. Davis was on leave for the 2019-2020 academic year.
Mehrotra has been a member of the Design faculty since 2010. He has previously served as chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Design between 2010 and 2015. He then served as the director of the Master of Architecture in Urban Design Degree Program as well as the co-director of the Master of Landscape Architecture in Urban Design Degree Program.
Prior to joining the GSD, Mehrotra taught at both the University of Michigan and MIT. He is also the founder of the firm RMA Architects, which is based in both Boston and Mumbai.
While Mehrotra had previously served as chair of the department, he said in an interview Monday that he hopes to bring a renewed focus to the intersections between design and planning programs.
“These are completely disparate groups, but it also is an opportunity because if one can construct a forum for the appropriate dialogues between these groups it can be incredibly productive for both groups. Designers learning about planning and planners learning about design,” he said. “I think there’s an amazing opportunity for a planning program to be in a design school.”
As a new housing and urbanization professor, Mehrotra will take over from Professor Emeritus Gerald M. McCue, who has served in the John T. Dunlap professorship since 1996.
Mehrotra said he is looking forward to this new role, which he said will provide a new focus to his work.
“It’s very exciting. I think the professorship is a real honor and it’s going to help me focus my work, which has been in the areas of urbanization and housing, but to have a formal title will help me to distill the many disparate things I have done with regard to urbanization and housing,” he said.
Design School Dean Sarah M. Whiting said in a press release that Mehrotra will help the school and its students study modern “debates and discoveries” in design.
“As we look toward our collective ‘near future,' Rahul brings an unmatched depth of insight to this contemporary moment,” she said. “His extraordinary synthesis of pedagogy, practice, and a generous ethos will continue to guide us into challenging but essential debates and discoveries.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James B. Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who was fired by President Donald J. Trump in 2017, defended his controversial tenure as head of the FBI at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Monday night.
In a more than hour-long discussion with Eric B. Rosenbach, co-director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, Comey acknowledged that decisions he made in handling investigations into Trump and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “hurt the FBI.” However, he insisted repeatedly during the discussion that he made the best possible choices given the situations he was in.
“Decisions that I made hurt the FBI — and that’s important,” Comey said in response to a question from Rosenbach about public trust in the Bureau. “I still believe if I had chosen the other door, I would’ve hurt the FBI worse. But there’s no doubt, I knew we were spending the FBI’s credibility.”
Less than two weeks before Election Day 2016, Comey sent shockwaves through the political sphere when he reopened an investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she served as Secretary of State under then-President Barack Obama.
Comey has also drawn criticism for publicly assailing Clinton as being “careless” during a July 2016 press conference during which he announced the FBI would not recommend charges against her.
Following her loss to Trump, Clinton publicly said Comey was a factor in her defeat. Asked by audience member Benjamin B. Bolger whether he would apologize to Clinton for his actions, Comey said he would not.
“If you really understand the position we were in — that I was in — on October 28, you walk away saying, ‘Oh my god, that was a very hard decision,’” Comey said. “So I’d want her to understand that.”
Comey said he has never met Clinton, but added it was “painful” for him that she wrote in her book she had been “shivved” by him.
Asked by an audience member if he would have written a different report than former Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, Comey assented.
“If I had to do it over again in the benefit of hindsight, I would either not include any of the facts about obstruction or lay them all out and make the accusation,” Comey said.
He added that he also would have tried to “communicate in a way that Americans consume information today,” as opposed to a 448-page report, which Mueller released to the public last April.
In his report, Mueller found 10 actions by Trump that could have constituted obstruction of justice, but he declined to make a determination as to whether or not Trump broke any laws.
Rosenbach also asked Comey about academic espionage and brought up the controversy surrounding Harvard Chemistry Chair Charles M. Lieber, who was placed on leave last month after being charged in federal court for failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government. Rosenbach called Lieber’s alleged actions “inappropriate.”
“What we have to do in places like the FBI is simply sensitize the academic community to know everyone’s not a friend, and some people want to collaborate to develop better ideas — better formulas — but some people are working for an adversary to steal your stuff,” Comey said, though he added he was not familiar with Lieber’s case.
Experts told The Crimson that Lieber’s arrest was part of an ongoing crackdown on academic espionage.
Attendee Erin M. Guetzloe ’23 said she left Monday’s forum with a newfound respect for Comey.
“I’m still skeptical of the decisions that he made, but I think that I leave with a more positive impression of him as a person,” Guetzloe said.
Comey, who published a best-selling book in 2018, said at the event he was satisfied with his actions as FBI director.
“I’m really proud of the way we conducted ourselves,” Comey said.

Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 outlined efforts taken by the Law School to confront instances of judicial misconduct and sexual harassment against clerks in a school-wide email Thursday.
The email follows Law School graduate Olivia A. Warren’s Feb. 13 testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, in which she described repeated instances of sexual harassment by the late federal judge Stephen R. Reinhardt.
Warren said in her statement to the Committee that she met with Manning and other Law School administrators about the harassment but was not informed of any subsequent action.
Manning wrote in his email that the Law School has taken steps to warn students applying for clerkships about judicial misconduct and will assist students and graduates in finding new employment if necessary.
“We’ve instituted new programs focused on sexual harassment, navigating workplace misconduct, and bystander intervention, and enhanced our communications efforts to ensure students and graduates understand their options, recourse, and remedies should they experience harassment during a clerkship,” Manning wrote.
Several students responded to the email on Twitter, noting the lack of an apology in Manning’s message.
“No acknowledgement of, let alone apology for, the fact that Liv Warren specifically talked about meeting with Dean Manning about the abuse in question and getting no follow-up whatsoever,” Law School student Andre R. Manuel wrote in a Tweet.
Law School graduate Jacqueline M. Trudeau pointed out that Manning’s sympathy came after Warren criticized administrators’ inaction in her testimony.
“To clarify, was he saddened and appalled only when he listened to her testimony before the committee?” Trudeau wrote in a tweet. “What about when he met with her? Was he not saddened and appalled then?”
Other Law School students questioned the legitimacy of the efforts to stop sexual harassment described by Manning.
“He claims there have been ‘efforts’ & ‘new programs,’ but if these exist (??) this is the first we’ve heard about it in our past 2 years of advocacy,” Law School student A. Vail Kohnert-Yount wrote in a tweet.
“It is not just embarrassing but truly demoralizing that this man is our dean,” she added.
Law School spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an email that the school has increased “information sharing and support resources” for current and prospective judicial clerks, such as by publicizing the judiciary’s mechanisms for reporting misconduct.
The school also publishes blog posts and information on the Office of Career Services website to inform clerkship applicants — both students and alumni — of the resources available for researching judges and finding alternative employment, according to Jackson.
In 2018, the Law School proposed changes to the Code of Conduct and Judicial Conduct and Disability Rules for U.S. judges, calling for a central office to receive misconduct complaints and systemic reviews.
Manning acknowledged in his email that, despite these efforts, there is “much work” still to be done.
“We are committed to that crucial work,” Manning wrote.

The Harvard Graduate Council discussed a trio of programs spanning the University’s 12 graduate schools in a meeting featuring representatives from each school Monday night.
The group began the meeting by reviewing the One Harvard Catalyst Fund, an opportunity for graduate schools to invite other schools to collaborate on and host various events and projects.
“The HGC One Harvard Catalyst Fund is for if you have an idea for something that you want to bring students from different schools together,” Chanthia C. Ma, the vice president of the Council, said.
The Fund offers two different options for applicants. A “fast-track” option is for those who have project proposals that need funding immediately, offering them up to $500. The traditional fund, which involves a longer review process, awards grantees up to $2500.
Jacqueline “Jackie” Yun, the executive director of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Center, also discussed the launch of Engage — a new hub meant to modernize and facilitate graduate student involvement in activities — at the meeting.
Initially offered at Yale, the new platform was created by Campus Labs, a software company that creates software specifically tailored for colleges and universities.
Yun cited the lack of a centralized system where student organizations could publicize, promote, and process different activities as a plus of the new system.
“Before, there was no real way to connect students with groups in GSAS,” Yun said.
The meeting concluded with a presentation from Robert “Rob” C. Watson Jr. ’09, the Director of Student Programs at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. He discussed the Harvard Votes Challenge, an initiative launched in 2014 to mobilize the Harvard community to engage more in civic responsibilities.
“The Harvard Votes Challenge is a university-wide program to increase and institutionalize student voter readiness efforts across the university,” Watson said.
Watson said the percentage of eligible Harvard voters who casted ballots has increased by 24.6% since HVC’s advent in 2014. He also offered each graduate school an opportunity to participate in the program.
“Through the President’s Administrative Innovation Fund, we’re supporting each Harvard school to form a voting team made up of faculty staff and students to establish a basic infrastructure for voting,” Watson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Lowell House reopened in fall 2019 — after two years of renovations — the sounds of construction in River Central gave way to the peals of bells.
The bells are rung by the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers, an organization of “earplug-wearing and weather-braving” undergraduate bell ringers — and are officially known as “Klappermeisters,” according to the Lowell House website.
The bells sound every Sunday at 1 p.m., in addition to other special events, such as an annual performance of Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” or other “important House or University occasions.”
Still, despite their musical charms, some undergraduates reported mixed feelings about the bells.
Some students said the bells can be distracting or disturbing during hours when they are studying or napping in their rooms. Leverett resident Lana M. Gorlinski ’20 said she thinks the bells are “obnoxious” and can be disruptive to her day.
“I think there's definitely a trade off between tradition and preserving it, and convenience of the students that have to listen to that tradition, which frankly, sounds awful to anybody that's not actively ringing the bell,” she said. “Whenever I walk by, when they're ringing, I get irrationally angry.”
Numerous posts on Harvard Confessions — a Facebook page which allows students to anonymously opine on their personal lives or Harvard related subjects — have also referenced the Lowell bells negatively.
The Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers declined to comment for this article.
Several students, however, have come to the defense of the bells. Aidan B. Carey ’21 — a former Crimson news editor and Lowell resident — acknowledged that he understands why people find the bells “annoying.” He also said he believes the dislike among residents of other nearby Houses stems from a lack of knowledge of the bells’ history.
“If you're in Lowell, you can complain about the noise but at least you can appreciate the history associated with the house,” he said. “Yeah, I'll admit that it's annoying, but I think the historical elements outweigh the annoyance of having to listen to it.”
According to the Lowell website, bells of this nature held a “religious and civic significance” in Russian history. Lowell House originally held a set of bells from the Danilovsky Monastery — installed in the 1930s — that escaped the Stalininst policy of removing and melting church and monastery bells during the 1920s. In 2008, this set was removed and returned to Danilovsky and replaced by a new set of bells.
Kevin T. Stephen ’20, another Lowell resident, said he believes bellringing is an “important method” for preserving the culture associated with the bells, and added he thinks the Society of Russian Bell Ringers does an “excellent job” in this regard. He also said “jealousy” and “ignorance” of the bells’ history are the reasons behind students’ dislike.
“I think the Lowell bells are a reminder to everyone else on the river that Lowell House is the best house and a reinforcing of our superiority on the river,” he said. “So yeah, for everyone else who hears the Lowell bells, it’s a majestic symphony every Sunday afternoon. You're welcome.”

After a Friday bargaining session, Harvard’s graduate student union accused the University of “hiding behind the Trump administration” to undermine contract negotiations in an email to members Monday.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University met for a bargaining session last Friday, joined for the fifth time by a federal mediator. No new tentative agreements were reached, and the two sides remain at an impasse over key issues including compensation and procedures for discrimination and harassment.
In Monday’s email to members, HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Jennifer “Jenni” K. Austiff wrote that the University “has no intention of bargaining in good faith toward an agreement.” Austiff wrote that throughout the six weeks of mediated bargaining sessions, “the administration has refused to bring even a single proposal” regarding the union’s “core demand” of protections against discrimination and harassment.
HGSU-UAW has argued that its members should be given the option to raise complaints of sexual harassment and discrimination through a union grievance procedure — a dispute resolution mechanism outside Harvard’s extant internal channels, and one that could in some cases lead to third-party arbitration. The University, on the other hand, has insisted that these complaints be handled through internal discrimination procedures.
In Monday’s email, Austiff wrote that Harvard’s refusal to engage with the union’s proposal comes at a time of particular frustration, as colleges and universities across the nation await the imminent release of new federal Title IX guidelines.
“[Harvard is] continuing to deny these protections, even as Betsy Devos’s Department of Education is working to roll back Title IX protections and other civil rights protections on campus,” Austiff wrote.
Austiff also alleged in the email that, in recent bargaining sessions, the University has engaged in what she termed “regressive bargaining,” reneging on previously agreed upon proposals over issues such as workload provisions.
“We had agreed on a conceptual framework on this issue for nine months and had agreed on specific language for nearly 3 months—with language that had come from the administration itself,” Austiff wrote. “But yesterday, the administration rejected both the language and the principle of these workload protections.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the updates from the new bargaining session, citing the confidentiality of the mediation process.
Austiff further alleged that, under the National Labor Relations Act, “regressive bargaining” is illegal. She wrote that the University is relying on “the Trump National Labor Relations Board” — which is responsible for carrying out the law — to “not enforce student workers’ labor rights.”
Former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said in an interview that the behavior Austiff termed “regressive bargaining” does not constitute bargaining in bad faith, and thus, per the NLRA, is not illegal.
“To take a position that is less favorable to a union, which would be regressive bargaining, is not in and of itself an unfair labor practice,” Gould said.
“I’m not even sure that it could be said that Harvard is engaging in what would generally be called regressive bargaining based on these facts,” he added.
HGSU’s email also stated that the University will not guarantee a “union security” provision to ensure all student workers pay dues to the union.
“In contrast, the administration continues to insist on a ‘right-to-work’ provision that would starve our union of the resources that we need to represent student workers in grievances and bargain subsequent contracts,” the email reads.
Austiff wrote in the email that, after asking to meet with administrators to discuss these complaints, the University asked the union to instead file an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB. She wrote that, given that the federal board is currently dominated by Trump appointees, bringing a charge before it might lead the NLRB to reverse the 2016 decision that permits student unionization at private universities across the country.
“The administration knows that to file a charge now would put all student workers at private universities at risk,” Austiff said. “They are waiting for the Trump administration to take away our legal rights.”
Gould said that asking HGSU-UAW to file such a charge could be illegal, especially without an explanation for the changed position.
“Now we know why they want them to file a charge here because the Trump Board will hold that the graduate students are not employees within the meaning of the law,” Gould said.

Outside law enforcement experts will review the internal climate of Harvard’s police department as well as its dealings with the University more broadly following accounts of racism and sexism within HUPD that surfaced last month, according to an internal department email.
HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley announced the review earlier this month, citing a Crimson investigation that found repeated instances of racism and sexism in HUPD over three decades. In court documents and interviews, 21 current and former employees alleged that Riley created what they described as a hostile work environment.
In an email sent to HUPD employees Monday morning and obtained by The Crimson, Riley announced the appointments of national policing experts Ronald L. Davis and Brenda J. Bond-Fortier to lead the review alongside five HUPD employees and Harvard Human Resources representative Maria Mejia. 
Riley laid out the scope and goal of the forthcoming investigation, which he will oversee alongside University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp.
“The review’s scope will include both internal operations and support for our uniform and non-uniform ranks, as well as how our Department engages with the broader community, ensuring that we are in the strongest position possible to effectively, honestly and respectfully carry out the public safety mission we are charged with,” he wrote.
In seven bullet points, Riley charged the committee with responsibilities including revamping department procedures for handling internal complaints, promoting retention of minority officers, improving department morale, and soliciting feedback from University affiliates.
The committee will periodically update Riley and Lapp with its progress and will then share its findings and recommendations with the department by the end of the academic year, according to his email. After writing its report, the committee will help the department implement its recommendations.
The pair of outside experts who will lead the review bring federal experience with criminal justice to Cambridge.
Davis previously served as a top official in the United States Department of Justice, where he oversaw efforts to implement community-oriented policing. In 2014, then-President Barack Obama appointed Davis to direct a task force on modern policing practices.
Bond-Fortier, an associate professor of public service at Suffolk University, also has ties to the Justice Department, where she provides expertise to the Smart Policing Initiative. She has conducted research in criminal justice policy at both the National Police Foundation and the Harvard Kennedy School.
Riley wrote in the email that he hopes the review will bring substantive change to the department’s climate and its relationship with the University at large.
“I have great pride in this Department. Each day our commitment to the safety and wellbeing of our community helps ensure that Harvard is a place where we all can do our best work,” he wrote. “However, in light of the recent Crimson articles, I remain concerned about our internal department climate, as well as the perception and interactions we have with members of our community.”
Lapp declined to comment beyond Riley’s email.
The review comes as the department faces fresh scrutiny following a trespassing arrest at the Smith Campus Center on Thursday. Several witnesses alleged the HUPD officer involved used excessive force during the arrest, which was partially captured on video.
On Monday evening, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on whether the department will formally review the arrest, citing longstanding HUPD policy not to comment on ongoing criminal cases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted to bring a proposed affordable housing overlay before the planning board and ordinance committee during their meeting Monday night.
The overlay — which was a key issue in the last election cycle — is a zoning proposal that would allow affordable housing developers to compete with market rates by streamlining permitting processes for housing units that are considered 100 percent affordable.
Cambridge’s municipal zoning laws require a minimum of six votes to pass the council; in September, city councilors unanimously voted to table the overlay after months of heated debate indicated that the measure would not pass if put to a vote.
The policy order that the council approved Monday will bring the 2020 version of the overlay back to the planning board and ordinance committee for further discussion.
During the public comment section of Monday’s meeting, Cambridge residents said they had mixed feelings about the measure’s revival.
Harvard Square Neighborhood Association president and Fine Arts and African American Studies professor at Harvard Suzanne P. Blier said she was “disappointed” to see the overlay return “without new study or discussion about key problems and touch points in it.”
Blier said that an amended housing overlay should take the environment, sustainability, and social equity in housing into consideration.
“We need to look at the root causes of these concerns and not advocate for a band-aid that does not stop the bleeding and does not resolve the core problems,” she added.
Other residents during the public comment section said that the reintroduction of the housing overlay is a necessary step that the city must take to create affordable housing.
Eva Martin-Blythe, executive director of the Young Women’s Christian Association in Cambridge, said the overlay “may not be perfect” but offers a “manageable solution” to the city’s housing crisis.
“We've micromanaged and weighed down the overlay proposal so much that continued discussion and continued work on it and continued changes and amendments to it run the risk of it being non-functional,” Martin-Blythe said.
“I don't believe that that's what we want,” she added. “Every time there's a proposal on the table, like the hundred percent housing overlay that is in any way reasonable, we will support it.”
During Monday’s meeting, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, who sponsored the proposal to re-introduce the overlay alongside Councilor E. Denise Simmons, Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr., spoke about how the new proposal includes discussion and deliberation that took place last year.
McGovern said the overlay was discussed in “over twenty community meetings” and that ordinance committee discussions totaled roughly 2700 hours last term.
He also noted that out of 62 proposed amendments, 46 amendments were approved throughout previous deliberation. All 46 amendments have been incorporated into the new version of the overlay, according to McGovern.
“We have done a lot of work on this, and all we're doing tonight is moving into ordinance where we're going to do more work,” McGovern said.
“I hope we can just move this forward and dig deeper into the merits and any other amendments that we're going to adopt in the ordinance committee,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lack of snow in Cambridge this year has not stopped the Harvard Alpine and Nordic ski teams from having a historic season. Last week, the ski team concluded its regular season by placing 10th out of 26 teams at the Williams Carnival. Crimson skiers dug deep, with sophomore Emma Ryan and senior Dillon Smith posting career bests, along with five men finishing in the top 50 and three women in the top 45 for the slalom race.
Last week’s carnival especially resonated with junior captain Nellie Ide, who described the race as the culmination of not only intense dedication and training from all members of the team, but of their resilience and persistence through challenges.
“Everyone has handled [injuries and other challenges] really well,” Ide said. “We’ve had a little bit of challenges with injuries, having some people not able to race, but we’ve definitely had some really strong results from pretty much everyone on the team. We’ve been getting a lot of career best finishes, which is really exciting.”
Practices for the ski team are a greater ordeal than most other teams’ walks across the river. On three separate days during the start of the week, the Alpine team leaves a dark and sleepy campus at 5:30 A.M. for a two-hour drive. After a few hours of training in the New Hampshire mountains, they return to campus in time for noon classes. Thursday afternoons see the team travel to carnival sites throughout New England, and Fridays and Saturdays bring intense and competitive races.
The Nordic team’s schedule follows a similar weekly structure. Three mornings bring productive practices that take place at a ski track 15 minutes away from campus. The team also leaves Thursday afternoons to inspect the courses and to get in the zone for its weekend race. Surprisingly, the least amount of training for the year is done during the winter.
“Most of the hours people put in come during the summer and the fall,” sophomore James Kitch said, chalking the lack of in-season training up to travelling and races.
Front-loading training allowed both teams to start the season on a high note at the first ever Harvard Carnival. This kickoff was the culmination of efforts from the team and coaching staff, along with the athletic department, in organizing this inaugural race. Both teams showed up in force, with many skiers notching top 10, 20, and 30 finishes in their respective races. One skier’s performance stood out amidst these impressive results — in his first ever race for the Crimson, first-year Rémi Drolet placed second in the men’s 20km classic race.
Both Kitch and Ide expressed high levels of optimism, not only for the first-years on the team but for future classes of Harvard skiing. The sophomore described this season’s team as the most “competitive and promising” it’s ever been. This is largely in part to outstanding performances from first-years like Drolet, as well as Annabel Hagen, Lily Brunelle, and Phoebe Meyerson. Ide, along with witnessing the improvements of every new addition to the team, credited Alpine head coach Scott MacPherson for his contributions to recruiting this current class of great skiers.
“The program is becoming a lot more competitive in the East,” Kitch said. “We’ve been attracting many talented [and] motivated skiers.”
In addition to successful outings at races hosted by other teams such as UVM and Colby, the Bates Carnival was most indicative of the Crimson’s fantastic season. Drolet won the men’s 20km classic race — the first men’s nordic skier from Harvard to win a race since the 1972-1973 season. Compounded with Kitch’s seventh place finish and sophomore Liam McInroy’s career best at 19th, the men’s Nordic team recorded a historic second place in the race. Ide also recorded a career best, as well as one of the Crimson’s best finishes in recent history, by placing fifth in the women’s slalom.
The ski team looks to continue its success at the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association regional carnival next week at Middlebury after this weekend of rest. Ide hopes the whole team can be healthy and ready to suit up for this last race, and both she and Kitch believe that Harvard will be represented at the NCAA championships in Montana in March. Ending the season is never easy, but, in light of this year’s success and the incoming additions to the Crimson’s already talented team, Kitch emphasized that “it’s a really exciting time to be a Harvard skier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard hosted a pair of high-leverage showdowns last weekend as it welcomed to Cambridge two teams in the hunt for Ivy League tournament bids. The fluid nature of the conference meant that the Crimson, which entered action in a three-team tie for third place, could have finished the weekend anywhere between first and fifth in the Ivies. Harvard did its part, edging Princeton and then Penn in tight games to avenge losses at the home stadiums of the southernmost Ancient Eight schools and improve to 7-3 in league play, two games ahead of the fifth-best Quakers.
Here are some takeaways from a crucial home sweep, which allowed the Crimson (18-7, 7-3 Ivy League) to maintain a perfect home record and brought it closer to securing a top seed in next month’s Ivy Madness:
Tight Throughout: Harvard’s two wins came by a combined five points, but beyond that, there were no huge runs to extend leads or come back from large deficits. The Crimson neither led nor trailed by double-figures all weekend; its largest deficit was nine points, and its biggest lead was eight.
“All of these games have been similar thoughts of how important and desperate the games are for everyone,” said head coach Tommy Amaker after Saturday’s win. “I think that is indicative of the level of play in our league and how tough our league is and how teams are fighting and scratching and clawing their way at this time of the year.”
This was a departure from the games in Philadelphia and Princeton three weeks back, when Harvard lost by a combined four points but had to come back from early deficits of 19 and 16 points — and trailed substantially even late in each — respectively.
But like it had three weeks earlier, the Crimson trailed for most of both games and faced six point deficits at halftime both Friday and Saturday. Easy wins have come few and far between for Harvard in Ivy League play. Of its 17 league wins since the start of last season, just three — and one this year — have come by double-digits, which makes the Crimson’s success in close games under Amaker all the more important.
Free Throw Shooting Woes: A 4-for-13 performance from the stripe on Friday nearly did Harvard in. The Crimson’s leading playmaker, sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood, had an especially difficult weekend from the line. He missed all five of his attempts, including the front end of a one-and-one with eight seconds left Friday that gave the Tigers a final chance to steal a win at Lavietes Pavilion.
Harvard’s struggles from the line are nothing new. The Crimson is shooting just 60 percent from the charity stripe in conference play, 10 percentage points worse than next-worst Cornell. That is down from 73 percent in nonconference play and would rank fourth worst in the country over the full season.
This is perhaps where Harvard most misses senior guard Bryce Aiken, who remains out indefinitely with a sprained foot. Aiken is a career 85 percent free throw shooter, and as the lead ball-handler he was usually the one tasked with putting games away late with pressure free throws.
Without Aiken and with Kirkwood and senior wing Justin Bassey struggling from the line, Amaker can perhaps only be confident when senior guard Christian Juzang heads to the stripe late in tight games. But Juzang has attempted just two free throws in the last five games and 37 on the season, two fewer than Aiken, who has played in 16 fewer games. Getting the ball into his hands more late in games could go a long way to ensuring cleaner conversions of late leads to victories.
Clutch Kirkwood: Free throws aside, Kirkwood was impressive again and looks more and more comfortable as the Crimson’s leading man. When the offense struggles to create open looks, it looks to the sophomore. He went to his patented step-back three — or in some cases, long two — on crucial possessions and was the only player to score for Harvard in the first six minutes against the Quakers.
The Ottawa native is averaging upwards of 15 points per game over the last nine and has consistently shown an ability to hit difficult shots. He is shooting a stellar 53 percent from midrange and 40 percent from beyond the arc in conference play.
“[Kirkwood] has a tendency to hit a lot of really timely buckets for us,” said Bassey. “Whether that’s when the other team’s on a run, and he can silence them with his step-back. He is one of the few guys for our team who can really create his own shot, but also being super unselfish about it. It’s really uplifting.”
Kirkwood’s 4-for-6 performance from beyond the arc this weekend was particularly important given the extent to which the rest of the team struggled on long range efforts. Everyone else combined to shoot 5-for-26, and Harvard’s bench missed all 14 of its three point attempts in the two games, a continuation of a trend started when the Crimson nearly bricked itself to a home loss to Columbia last Saturday, making just eight of its 43 shots from deep. Many of the misses in the last three games have been ugly, and Harvard clearly scaled back its attempts against Penn and Princeton, taking fewer than half as many triples as it had the previous weekend.
That the Crimson could win both games this weekend despite those struggles is evidence of its strengths elsewhere and particularly of its rebounding on both ends and rim protection. But Harvard must find perimeter threats not named Noah Kirkwood if it hopes to improve offensively down the stretch. Its next chance to do so will be this weekend, when the Crimson travels to face Ancient Eight doormats Columbia and Cornell.

As Harvard students, we love saying yes to things. Sure, 10 p.m. is an awfully inconvenient time to mark green on the When2Meet, but it’s not like you have anything planned then (at the moment, at least). And sure, you can definitely make it to the meeting later this week. Does your friend want to go shopping together? That sounds so fun, and you’ve been needing to get out of the Harvard bubble lately anyway!
Pretty soon, you’ll find that your GCal has an eerie resemblance to a color swatch template at Home Depot, or you’ll discover that your schedule doesn’t account for things like mealtimes and sleep. For the sake of maintaining a healthy baseline of human functioning, or if you’re just not feeling it anymore, here are a few ways to say no without sounding like a flake.
The “Unavoidable Conflict”
Humans make mistakes. Sometimes, you’ll realize that you can’t make it to Responsibility A because you just happened to schedule Responsibility B at the same time! If the thought of cancelling is still enough to make you wince with guilt, you can always ask to reschedule or to make it up another way.
The Visiting Friend
Meetings are important, but so is your high school friend who you haven’t seen in two years. As the saying probably goes, logistical meetings are a dime a dozen, but memories with loved ones are a lifetime. People will understand that you have to show your friend the deceptively dry foot of John Harvard, and no one else can do it other than you.
The Common Cold
It’s called common for a reason — it’s not your fault that this is the third time you’re calling in sick this semester. Consider it as a favor to others for not walking around with a contagious disease. There’s no such thing as too much rest, and pushing yourself will only lead to another obligation that you’ll be even sicker to attend.
Mental Health Day
As terrifying as it may seem, it’s okay to call off a commitment to take some time for yourself. You may be the treasurer of a club or a social butterfly, but you’re also a full-time student who is capable of burning out. Sometimes, being honest about your situation and acknowledging your limits — both in time and energy — is the best and most valid excuse. Extensions are available for a reason, and the club president who asked for your deliverable will understand. Most likely, they’ve been there, too.
These methods are tried and true for getting yourself out of that commitment you truly want to avoid, but use them as sparingly as you would a Get Out of Jail Free card. Ultimately, the responsibility you shirk becomes the work someone else must pick up, and the best suggestion of all is to take on only as much as you can handle. While it may weigh on your conscience, saying no early on is better than flaking on something that you know you won’t be able to commit to.
