After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LA ROCHELLE, France — Like many other unsuspecting American travelers, I came to Europe with a rather rosy idea of European train travel.  Every guidebook that I have ever read expounds on the virtues of the system—travelers can hop on and off trains whenever and wherever they desire at very little expense!  When I arrived in Paris, I came equipped with a Eurail flexi pass, allowing me to travel on four days within two months anywhere in France and Spain.  A cheap and flexible option, or so I thought.  
Train travel in Europe is actually a paradox:  It’s only cheap if you book way in advance, and only flexible if you don’t mind paying extra for the privilege and don’t have a set itinerary.  High-speed lines seem like a logical choice if you want to travel a sizeable distance, since local lines will take all day.  However, because these trains are apparently very popular, rail pass holders must pay an additional fee to reserve a seat (anywhere from 3 to 45 Euros and up).  Most trains require a reservation, and it has to be done at a train station, not online.  The timetable that comes with the pass isn’t very useful either –the train station agent had to explain to me that she only had two itineraries for the day I planned to travel (I think she thought I was being very demanding for not wanting to arrive in a strange city at 4 a.m.).  After wrangling with her for about 45 minutes, trying to negotiate the cheapest itineraries, I came away with three tickets for journeys that take on average 10 hours each, and I still have to book one in Spain because apparently I couldn’t reserve that particular route in France.  Europe’s comprehensive rail system is still a great achievement, but navigating the thing is definitely no simple task.

SEOUL, South Korea — In Seoul, I’m staying at Ewha Womans’ University, or as some people call the area, Ewha Beauty Shop. This is in reference to the multitude of shoe shops, clothing kiosks, makeup stores and, of course, beauty shops, that hit you in a tidal wave of pink as soon as you step outside the gates. Short skirts, sky-high heels, bows, and sparkles abound. It seems strange that the college at the center of this Barbie-land has been the source of tremendous empowerment for Korean women. South Korea’s first female prime minister, its first female justice on the Constitutional Court, and the youngest international soccer referee all went to Ewha. Living in this area of mixed signals, a living representation of the dichotomy embodied by Legally Blonde’s Elle Woods, keeps issues of gender equality and femininity constantly on the mind.
Korea is certainly a conservative country in terms of gender-relations. On the whole, women are often seen as fragile, shy, and in need of protection. Korea’s hottest music group is the nine-member teen girl group “Girls’ Generation,” has rocketed to stardom with cutesy outfits and “who, me?” Lolita looks. All Korean men must serve two years in the army; Korean women have no such national service obligation. In my workplace, too, a 200-employee public research institute, the entire management corps is male. The Korean traditional clothing for women, the hanbok, has no waist—it is fitted under the shoulders to reveal no womanly shape.
To my untrained eye, I cannot see how sequestering a girl in a dollhouse like the Ewha area can possibly prepare them to be strong leaders and build a more equal society. In my mind, female CEOs, politicians, and presidents wear power suits, not frills. Perhaps this mentality—that in business and politics, women get ahead by adapting to the male status quo, at least superficially—is dated. Vogue put Michelle Obama on its March cover partly because, as its Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour commented, “She believes, as we do at Vogue, that to be an independent, working woman doesn't mean that you have to walk around with a brown paper bag on.” But, perhaps it’s not as dated as we think. A recent Ewha graduate who served as president of the Harvard College in Asia Program in Korea told me of her time at the school, “I had a hard time because I’m not the ‘typical’ Ewha girl, I’m not so interested in makeup or clothes. But I don’t think I would have had the leadership positions I had here at a [co-ed] college.” Maybe, despite the opportunities Ewha affords Korean women, the real solution is less pink.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brett C. Sweet, dean of administration and finance for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will leave Harvard in late July to assume the role of Vice Chancellor and Chief Financial Officer at Vanderbilt University, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced Thursday morning.  Sweet will leave less than a year after he first arrived on campus in September, as Harvard's endowment was on its way to an unprecedented four-month decline of 22 percent that would mean sweeping budget cuts for Harvard's largest school. A stalwart presence at Smith's side during these cutbacks and layoffs, Sweet has served a crucial role in the FAS administration, which has found itself saddled with a $220 million annual deficit to close over the next two years.  Sweet, who worked closely on the budgetary planning that so prominently dictated the University's operations this past year, is not the only high-profile finance administrator to leave the University this summer. Harvard announced little more than a month ago that its Executive Vice President, Edward C. Forst ’82, would leave Harvard in August for Wall Street, where he had worked for 26 years. Forst worked closely with Sweet in his role overseeing University finances amid the economic downturn.   “These positions are critical to our future. That’s why, as I understood there was no way to keep Brett, we immediately started to look at how we could fill in for him,” Smith said in an interview Thursday, adding that he has made adjustments to his own schedule to ensure that the national search for a replacement becomes a high priority. “We’re not wasting any time.”  Smith said Sweet told him of the news “just recently,” sometime during June, but he declined to provide a precise date. The news came as a surprise, Smith said, adding that despite the FAS leader’s best efforts to convince Sweet to stay, the finance dean stood firm.  “He made his decision, and I respected that,” Smith said.   After realizing that Sweet could not be swayed, Smith said he immediately initiated the search for an acting dean and reached out to officials throughout the University, asking them to extend their responsibilities slightly and take over portions of Sweet's duties. "Right now, we're stretching," Smith said. But he added that he has no plans to institute a mass restructuring of administrative positions.  Though Smith has not been privy to all of the details surrounding Sweet’s determination to leave, Smith said he believes that the Vanderbilt position constitutes a “wonderful opportunity” and “a step up.” Smith said he does not know if there were any other institutions besides Vanderbilt that Sweet had been considering as a future home.  Smith said that his conversation with Sweet had largely been focused on the remainder of Sweet’s tenure at Harvard and plans for continuing initiatives that had been started before Sweet announced his departure.   Sweet could not be reached for comment Thursday, but in a Vanderbilt press release, he said he was attracted to the "number of exciting strategic endeavors that many universities only talk about doing" and Vanderbilt's reputation for collaboration between faculty and staff.   “Universities struggle with this," Sweet said in the release. "Vanderbilt has cracked the code in this area, which is evidenced by the shared sense of vision and support by faculty, students and staff.”  Sweet's appointment as CFO will be effective in August, pending approval from the members on the Vanderbilt Board of Trust—the group vested with the governance of the University.  According to Vanderbilt spokeswoman Elizabeth L. Latt, Vanderbilt's CFO does not have direct oversight of the university's endowment, which had experienced a 16 percent decline as of December. Rather, the CFO manages the more "day-to-day" finances by dealing with specific units across the University.   A search committee was created in February to fill the vacancy left by former CFO Lauren Brisky's retirement, according to Latt. But she said she does not know if Sweet had been a candidate for the position since the committee's inception. Though Vanderbilt made its official announcement today, discussions between Sweet and the Vanderbilt administration to finalize the move transpired in June, Latt said.   Sweet, a former cryptographic researcher, has brought sharp insight to Harvard's finances for not only top Faculty deans but also the departments and centers that must translate the deluge of figures into real-life budget cuts, Smith said. After Smith delivered a mandate to departments to cut their budgets by 15 percent in December, Sweet became the go-to man who could bring reality to the numbers.   "Down through the organization, he's made it much easier for people in departments and centers to make decisions based on real information about what's happening in the system," Smith said on Thursday. "He has done a terrific job coming in and strengthening our organization."   “This last year, he's been pretty phenomenal, experienced or new, with all of the budget changes we’re going though,” said Nancy M. Cline, the head of the Harvard College Library, in an interview in May. “The breadth of problem-solving that a person has had usually makes a difference.”   The departure of Sweet, along with those traits that have made him a valuable financial administrator, may bode poorly for a University that will have to weather the financial storm without his aid.   “It’s unfortunate for Harvard because we clearly are in a very serious financial state,” said Harry R. Lewis ’68, former dean of Harvard College. “This is a place where it takes a lot to understand how it works. The learning curve is not overnight.”   But Smith said he is confident that Sweet has set a standard for excellence that will ease the entrance of the next dean for administration and finance. Plus, Sweet’s successor will know full well the severity of the current fiscal picture, which only became fully clear after Sweet arrived at Harvard.   "I actually think it's a little bit better for the new incoming person than it was for Brett," Smith said. “[Sweet] has been extremely organized in his time here and has a lot of what’s going on recorded in ways that I think would be—I wouldn’t say easy—but absolutely possible for a new person to come in and get up to speed quickly."   Sweet, who once served as a special projects officer with the National Security Agency, has been hopping between employers and even countries for much of his professional life. After serving as a nuclear submarine officer on the USS Georgia in the 1990s, Sweet opted for finance over an offer to teach at the Naval Academy, according to his mother Carolyn Sweet.   After receiving his degree from Harvard Business School in 2000, Sweet started a four-year stint as a principal for the Boston Consulting Group—traveling to different states and even consulting for BMW in Germany for a year, according to Mrs. Sweet. He then served as executive vice president for administration and finance at Baylor College of Medicine before taking the reins of FAS finances last September.   —Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has eliminated 77 staff positions and reduced work hours for another 15 employees as part of the recent University-wide downsizing, Dean Michael D. Smith announced Wednesday.
The cuts amount to a 2.5 percent reduction in the School's staff workforce, according to FAS spokesman Steve Bradt, who also said that no faculty were affected by the downsizing. He declined to state where the layoffs occurred, saying only that they were spread throughout FAS. But Harvard College Library, a unit of FAS, was the source of roughly 20 of those 77 layoffs, according to an announcement last week that also said the libraries had cut hours for several others employees.
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, said that roughly 30 staff from FAS in his union had been laid off, mostly in "ones and twos" from 13 different departments and offices across FAS. Some of the eliminated jobs corresponded to services that administrators previously announced would be cut, Jaeger said. But he also noted that his tally's methodology and his definition of a "layoff" may differ from the School's, since the union's count does not include workers who volunteered to be laid off, nor those who were offered alternative jobs at the same time that their positions were eliminated.
The savings achieved by the latest staff cuts, as well as those arising from personnel attrition and the University's voluntary early retirement incentive program, are part of the $77 million of FAS budget cuts announced in May, Bradt said. But even after the recent downsizing and other service reductions, FAS, the University's largest school, still has a projected $143 million annual deficit that Smith says must be eliminated by fiscal year 2011. As a result, the School has now embarked on a process of "resizing and reshaping" its operations.
In the letter, Smith wrote that the global economic downturn forced FAS to reexamine all of its spending, including the compensation costs that make up nearly half of the School's operating budget. He said that previous cost-cutting measures such as the early retirement program, salary freezes for faculty and exempt staff, limitations on new hiring, and offers of reduced hours did not achieve the necessary budget reductions.
"This difficult step was necessary to ensure that we can continue vital programs core to our mission," Smith wrote.
Bradt said that the recent layoffs "are all that are planned," but he noted that the six ad hoc working groups tasked with guiding FAS's restructuring—in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the College, and FAS's Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities Divisions—would be "discussing and weighing future courses of action well into the fall."
In their letters announcing the downsizing last week, University President Drew G. Faust and Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote that 275 employees from throughout the University would be laid off in the coming days, split evenly between union and non-union staff. But Jaeger said he thought the announcement seemed somewhat premature and that even today he was not sure how administrators arrived at that precise number.
He said that based on the most recent analyses conducted by the Union, which should include almost all of the cuts at the University's various schools and campuses, roughly 130 HUCTW workers had been slated for layoffs. But 35 of those layoffs have been avoided through the use of "creative solutions" proposed by the union, he said, such as by consolidating work done by temporary or casual employees into full-time jobs, placing eliminated workers in vacancies that had been created by the early retirement program, and asking for volunteers to be laid off.
He noted that union negotiators still have "serious questions" about a handful of personnel cases and are continuing to engage with human resource officials about the cuts.
Despite the layoffs, Jaeger said he remained optimistic that all laid-off HUCTW staff would be able to find replacement jobs at the University, especially given the generous severance packages and job placement services provided for affected workers. The number of jobs posted throughout the University is sizable and growing, Jaeger said, adding that on the day the layoffs were announced last week, he counted 233 available jobs on the University's Web site. On Thursday, he said he noticed 17 new HUCTW job postings.
Although the media has scrutinized the layoffs and Harvard's financial planning in recent weeks, emphasizing that even the world's richest university is being forced to slash budgets, the staff cuts are not unprecedented. In 2004, while the endowment was growing, Harvard laid off over 200 employees, citing the need to eliminate multi-million dollar "systemic" budget deficits wrought by capital expansions and a slumping national economy.
Those workforce cuts similarly included large numbers of administrative and professional staff, unionized technical and clerical workers, and even some service and trade workers. Harvard College Library saw substantial staff reductions, and the University's central administration laid off 60 employees in an effort to cut costs and increase efficiency.
Protesters at the time also questioned the legitimacy of the University's budget-cutting justifications and pointed to the millions of dollars paid to endowment managers as evidence of Harvard's alleged corporatization. The "No Layoffs Campaign," the coalition of union activists, staff, and students that has spearheaded the recent protests of layoffs on campus, took shape during the 2004 downsizing. And some of the chants used in recent rallies are recitations of those heard five years earlier.
The faces that challenged the layoffs in 2004 have reappeared today as well. Geoff P. Carens, an HCL librarian vocally opposed to any kind of layoffs, organized rallies for the Campaign then as now, while Jaeger and other HUCTW leaders said in both instances that their focus is on negotiating with the University to find creative layoff alternatives.
