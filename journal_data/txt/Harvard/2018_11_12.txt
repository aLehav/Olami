When tackling the monstrous task of Mahler’s Second Symphony, one might aptly describe the process by borrowing a term from the visual arts: chiaroscuro. Hefty and deeply spiritual in every musical stroke, the “Resurrection” symphony requires a domineering vision and deft balance of dramatic elements to deliver the tormented soul of its subject from oblivion to salvation. And aside from select moments of unwieldiness, conductor Andris Nelsons delivered exactly this at his Oct. 27 concert. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, along with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, led by James Burton, gripped the abrupt temporal and textural shifts with ready but spontaneous vigor. The result was a stunning ascent to radiant triumph.
The concert opened with the Boston premiere of Maija Einfelde’s “Lux Aeterna,” the second of two pieces of the season commemorating the centennial of Latvian independence. The piece is one of several Latvian compositions slated for this season.
Nelsons’ homage to the rich cultural and artistic densities of his roots rung throughout the piece: The pleated, ghostly fabric of the vocal lines tinkered with hallowed reverence, plucked like a handkerchief with punctuated peals of crotales. Turns of harmony slip-faulted into dissonance, only to spiral off again in fascinating dissonances. Intervals of silence ebb and surged as calm between successive storms. The final note of the six minute composition sustained into almost ten seconds of silence, yet instead of fading, the intriguing tension infused into the hall as though bored into wood — a telling launch for the trajectory of the rest of the program.
The ethereal translucency of Einfelde immediately threw a stark contrast to Mahler’s first movement as Nelsons raised his baton. The upper strings voices hid away while the cellos launched into their signature theme with the self assurance of a war proclamation. Already fiery, the theme was torn between brass and horns in a monopolizing tug-of-war before being reclaimed by the lower strings. Although the movement is dominated by dark and twisted overtones of the movement, occasionally a wistful violin passage punctuates through before being submerged once again in sorrow. Unlike in previous concerts, Nelsons chose not to observe the five minute pause at the end of the first movement as Mahler indicated, instead organically transitioning to the second movement with the thrums of the former still resonating in the hall.
The contrast payed off — the second movement’s cheery nonchalance provided a much needed reprieve from the mortal broil of the first. Full fleshed violins covered the melody with a sweet and dense cloud, conversationally bantering with the winds as though each were paired in ballroom dancing. A delightfully understated violin solo gave the section a subtle edge. The melody passed seamlessly to the harps and flutes, only to be infiltrated by the pained returning theme from cellos. As the minor hints colored into the violin section, they were repelled by the undulating rise and fall of timpani and horns. A ghostly pluck of strings, sharp tinges of harp, and lower string echoes remained. The major seventh tremolos from the violins signaled the return of cold, regimented march, ending on three solemn plucks.
The third movement featured a dark scherzo and the return of the opening urgency via timpani. The already ominous melodies were punched with percussive blows of bows on the bridge, demarcated like the frenzied passage of train over railroad tracks. One was struck by an urgent sense of flight, and the mood building was almost cartoonish. Caricatured characters emerged, only to be turned on their heads as they were derailed by other sections. The orchestra cumulated in a single unbridled scream, a disturbing antithesis of the conclusion of “Lux Aeterna.”
The final movement “Urlicht” opened with a series of explosions, which teemed with the coy promise of energy yet unleashed. As the exposed exchange of French horn and cello sections was dominated by violins, one could trace the passage of each melodic line by the visual feast of physical vigor, interspersed throughout by the warning of the timpani. However, a brief transition of muted drums shifted the downward spiral into its final linear ascension. Here was the jewel of the program: As the orchestra drew back with the flight of flutes announcing a higher future, the chorus emerged in full, bringing a yearning backdrop to mezzo-soprano Bernarda Fink and soprano Ying Fang’s joyful lines. As the tubular bells punctuated the swells of organ, the Tanglewood Festival Chorus sang with dynamic exchanges and perfect enunciation, delivering the finale into its final triumphant divinity. Mahler’s ending explosion scarcely finished before being overtaken by three standing ovations of thunderous applause — beyond resurrection, the performance delivered a rapture which continued long after the ending notes faded.

“The Twilight Saga” has long been dead and buried, but the CW’s new series “Legacies” attempts to resurrect the vampire-werewolf craze that the franchise made iconic. As a spin-off of “The Originals,” which itself is a spin-off of “The Vampire Diaries,” “Legacies” is an apt title for a show that rides on the coattails of its predecessors and desperately tries to inherit their lucrative formula of moody, unrealistically attractive supernatural beings plus familial issues, along with a heaping serving of convoluted romances.
“Legacies” centers around Hope Mikaelson (Danielle Rose Russell), a 17-year-old “tribrid” – a unique being that possesses the powers of vampires, werewolves, and witches simultaneously – who attends a boarding school for supernatural children and seeks to protect the non-human identities of her classmates from the outside world. In the series premiere, “This is the Part Where You Run,” Landon (Aria Shahghasemi) appears to be an ordinary boy who gets dragged into the supernatural world when his foster brother Rafael (Peyton ‘Alex’ Smith) turns out to be a werewolf, and he crosses paths again with Hope, a former flame.
Unfortunately, “Legacies” cannot make up for its lackluster characters: By the end of the series premiere, the most prominent identifiers of each character are still their physical features, or at most, a stereotypical label such as “orphaned heroine” for Hope, “dumb blonde” for Lizzie Saltzman (Jenny Boyd), and “quiet pushover” for Josie Saltzman (Kaylee Bryant). Even when the script attempts to distinguish various characters by giving them trite, self-reflective lines — like Hope’s comment that “I try not to get close to anyone anymore” — the series is too obviously telling rather than showing their personalities.
Despite the abundance of tropes in character design, one thing that “Legacies” handles appropriately is the absence of the dated coming out plotline from the portrayal of its LGBTQ characters, namely Josie and her ex-girlfriend Penelope (Lulu Antariksa). The overemphasis on the struggles of coming out usually only allows a single (often negative) facet of LGBTQ experiences to be represented in popular media, and “Legacies” wisely skips the sexual identity crisis and tosses Josie and Penelope the same will-they-won’t-they storyline as the other romantic pairings in the show.
The plot’s focus on attraction and rivalries for love is disappointing and a bit counterintuitive considering the series’ magical premise of witches, werewolves, and vampires attending a supernatural boarding school. The fantasy elements are often relegated to the background, used to set the mood for romance (such as when Hope holds Landon’s hands and conjures up a canopy of stars to help him fall asleep) or as an excuse for gratuitous special effects (like the brief demonstration of the magical sport of “wickery,” an imitation of Quidditch).
Like Hope, “Legacies” has difficulty settling on a single identity — it aims to be an intersection of various popular genres — namely teenage drama, romance, fantasy, and horror — yet comes across as a haphazard collage rather than a smooth blend. The diverse mix of cinematic techniques tug the viewer’s perception of the show this way and that with every new scene. One moment, wide, high-exposure shots depict Hope wistfully staring out a window after the departing figure of Landon, her potential love interest. However, within the next few minutes, the episode turns towards horror, using dim lighting, zoom-ins on drips of blood, and trippy, abruptly alternating fast-forward and slow-motion clips.
Despite shortcomings in character and plot-building, “Legacies” offers flashy special effects and a flawlessly beautiful cast, giving it the potential to be a guilty pleasure show of eye candy indulgence. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that — not every piece of media needs to be a deep commentary on society. However, if “Legacies” ever learns to take itself less seriously — perhaps satirizing teenage angst or making fun of its premise as a mashup of all the most popular book-movie franchises (ahem, “Harry Potter” and “Twilight”) — it could become a lot more engaging without having to change its core elements.

Have you ever wanted to watch a middle aged lawyer in a prison jumpsuit and an oversized thong realize her internalized racism and class privilege half way through an overeager “Chicago” parody?
Welcome to the world of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” One of the most heartfelt shows on TV, the CW veteran is fresh and unpredictable at every turn. In the new installments of its penultimate season, it promises even more fantastic surprises.
The brainchild of Rebecca Bloom, who also stars as its lovestruck, music-theater loving lead, “Crazy Ex Girlfriend” centers around the journey of New York lawyer turned suburban California inmate, Rebecca Bunch. In Season One, after a chance reunion with a high school summer camp fling, Rebecca quits her job to move to uneventful West Covina, California (“Only two hours from the beach — four in traffic”).
Of course, as the show’s demonstrated from the beginning, Rebecca’s surface-level “boy craziness” is more than some vacant-ingenue cliché. She’s been using her relationships and hyperactive imagination as a band-aid for the fact that she’s unhappy with her career, family, and relationships since the first episode. But, after finally hitting rock bottom at the end of the previous season, in Season Four she’s determined to come to terms with who she really is. That means, for the first time, not relying on men, or tried-on scripted female narratives, to construct a socially-acceptable identity.
“I Want to Be Here,” the season premiere, sees “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” seamlessly settling into this new paradigm, starting with Rebecca, finally, accepting the consequences of nearly killing someone. It’s the series’ first-ever episode not to include the name of a male romantic interest in the title, and debuts a theme song that is also, for the first time, not about another of Rebecca’s various “stereotypes.” In addition to that amazing “Chicago” homage, the second of its two musical numbers is an on-the-nose group number about the ironic universality of loneliness. In classic “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” style, the number is both tongue-in-cheek, with a 12-person unison chorus of “No one else is singing my song,” and, briefly, poignantly serious. Though each person singing is in a different place, every member of the cast can hear the others by the end of the number — except for Rebecca. It’s a subtle nod to the unique isolation that stems from her struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder, a deeper challenge that can’t be resolved in a neat four minutes.
The musical numbers in “I Am Ashamed” are similarly strong, if not particularly exceptional (they can’t all be “I Go To the Zoo.”) A feature from comedian Patton Oswalt and some great skeleton dresses make “The Cringe” harmless Halloween-themed fun. The second number, “Time To Seize the Day,” while not lyrically outstanding, achieves a rare tonal balance as it turns agoraphobia, self-sabotage, and six hours of Rebecca’s wallowing into two minutes of cheesy, comedic catharsis. In fact, it ends up being an emotional gut-puncher with enough time to simmer.
Unfortunately, the Halloween-inspired ghost storyline in the episode was less successful, and the writers failed to make Rebecca’s sudden obsession with the supernatural feel anything but out of character. Rebecca and her friends summoning a ghost as an exaggerated metaphor for Rebecca’s inability to let go of the past may have filled some kind of CW-witchcraft quota, but it took far too much time away from the otherwise excellent emotional arc of the episode.
All in all, Season Four is off to a promising start, with the wide-ranging musical numbers, spot-on comedy, and witty self-awareness that have always made it so irresistibly fun. The show is a master at balancing entertainment and introspection, with a human core always lying just beneath the extravagant, hare-brained comedy. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” is taking the risk of leaning in to the full range of its self-destructive protagonist, in all of her morally questionable, even near-fatal decisions. That boldness pays off in dividends, as the show manages to create a woman who’s capable of every hallmark crime of a “crazy” woman, but whose brokenness is so understandable, and so familiar, that she’s all but impossible not to love.

A week after the conclusion of the Harvard admissions trial, it is important to recognize that once-hidden details brought to light in court may have profound effects on University donations. The rather unsurprising revelation that children of major donors get a leg up in the admissions process — a practice that we oppose — could spur more donations from those willing, or a decrease due to negative perceptions. For many experts, it is simply too early to predict what effect, if any, the lawsuit will have on giving.
Still, the University should prepare for the worst.
Fiscal responsibility is something that both former University President Drew G. Faust and current University President Lawrence S. Bacow have emphasized. In particular, Bacow has asked that Harvard schools engage in “scenario planning” for when the next economic recession comes. This emphasis is important, and one that should remain — the University’s ability to advance its mission should depend as little as possible on outside economic factors.
While it is unclear whether or not the admissions trial’s impact on donations will become a significant concern for Harvard’s budget, the University should continue — as it has in the past — to err on the side of caution.
In prepation for an eventuality in which Harvard sees a significant decrease in donations, Bacow will need to take precautionary measures. One method for which there is already precedent would be for Bacow to ask all Harvard schools to engage in further “scenario planning.” This strategy allows the University and the entities that comprise it to examine many different possibilities in depth, making it an effective strategy at preparing for worst-case scenarios. Strategic planning in the present can also allow Harvard administrators to see a wider range of future possibilities. This allows those in power to more effectively take advantage of opportunities that arise in the present. In turn, administrators can prepare the University for the unexpected.
Despite our caution, we remain hopeful that alumni will continue donating and giving back to Harvard. No matter how they might feel about Harvard’s stance in this trial or the court’s verdict, we hope that alumni’s devotion to their alma mater will drive them to continue supporting current students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many reserve the honorific "hero" for those in the armed services. For them, a hero fearlessly charges into battle, ignoring all risk of death in service of their country. I served as an officer in the United States Navy for five years before coming to Harvard Law School, but I was never a hero. I was never deployed, never even touched a weapon, and never had to make a personal choice between life and liberty.
Everything changed when I came out as transgender.
Now, the battlefield is America, and I am on the front line, fighting for my life and rights. Transgender lives and rights are under attack. And whether or not I choose to fight this war, I will still face its consequences.
Several weeks ago, in the midst of my first semester here at Harvard, I found myself fighting alongside other BGLTQ individuals and allies at Harvard against the Trump administration, which is threatening to redefine gender and eliminate legal protections for transgender individuals. For several days, we worked to form a response to the actions, and we planned our participation in the subsequent protest in Boston.
I will not try to convince you to care about my fate because I think you already do. I believe that most people are good and want to do the right thing. Yet, still, many do not act. Despite our politically vocal student body, the majority of students I encountered seemed apathetic to the crisis, and, of the thousands of students at Harvard, only a small fraction actually protested the action by the administration. While disappointed by your inaction, I am not surprised: I think you do not act because you are afraid. I know I am too.
I have been afraid my entire life. When I was a young child, I was afraid of what my family and friends might think of me if I spoke my mind. In school, I was afraid of what a bully might do if I attracted their attention. As I grew older, I became afraid of standing out in a world where I just wanted to fit in. When I realized that I was transgender a year and a half ago, these fears were amplified a thousandfold. Coming to the Law School this fall, I was more anxious about how people would receive me than about the tremendous amount of work that was awaiting me.
However, living openly as a trans woman has finally taught me to be courageous.
Courage does not mean fearlessness. We are all human, after all. Nor does courage involve charging headfirst into battle. Few people crave conflict, and I am surely not one of them. Courage only requires that one transform belief into action in the face of fear. Anyone can be courageous, from the soldier on the front line to the conscientious objector who actively practices nonviolence in defiance of the state.
Even those who oppose trans rights are courageous: They fear us greatly, and they turn their beliefs into action every day. They spit out slurs, assault us, and, sometimes, even murder us. They elect politicians who strip us of our rights and try to legally erase our existence. They ignore our cries as we are abused in prisons and as we sell our bodies to survive. They are not evil, but they are both ignorant of our existence and apathetic to your judgement.
Those who harm us do not know what it is like to be transgender and to feel a need to break free of society and of our own bodies. They do not know of the pain we feel, being told we are unworthy of love, of freedom, and of justice. They see us as sexual deviants, criminals, or, if we are lucky, mentally-ill fetishists. As many have done in the past, sometimes with inhumane results, they deny our humanity. And although they fear us, they do not fear you, and why should they?
Some of you do act. Some schools at Harvard put out statements in support of trans rights in the wake of the revelation in October. Some protested the Trump administration. However, most of you stood idly by as the news broke. You still laugh at jokes made at our expense. Some of you do not even vote because the issues do not affect you. You do not raise your voice nor your hand, nor do you issue any objection at all. Your silence is our death. And you refrain from standing up because you are afraid, not of us but of them. You are afraid of the same things I am, of their judgement and their hand, of being different and not fitting in.
Let our fear unite us in purpose.
No one is asking you to fight our battle, but I am asking you to be courageous. Stand up for our humanity, even if it means standing up to family and your Harvard classmates. You do not have to be our sword, but I am asking you to be our shield, to stand firm beside us as we face our fears together, whether in the streets or in the classroom. I do not want you to suffer for us, but to comfort us in our suffering. Donate money to, volunteer for, and promote transgender causes, especially BGLTQ student groups here at Harvard. Live fiercely, proudly, and openly in support of transgender people, and show those who oppose trans rights that fear will not stop you from doing what is right.
I am asking you to be a hero.

I’m a graduate of an all-girls’ prep school. Our rigorous academic high school curriculum intended to prepare us, women, to lead the future of society. Among coursework that included calculus and principles of physics, I remember life advice most — those heart-to-heart moments when teachers shared what we really needed to know.
As in any good Catholic institution, instructors prepped for us for the heterosexual (and, in our case, upper-middle-class) life cycle. Accordingly, a statistics teacher informed us that numerically, STEM fields offered the best prospects for finding a husband. A drama teacher warned us that a woman should never marry a man prettier than her. Our school’s strict principal allowed us to write in our yearbooks that our dream futures involved marrying a lacrosse playing all boys’ prep school graduate and raising two children in the suburbs.
You see, our high school preparation was not just for a bachelor’s degree, but for the “Mrs.” For the uninitiated, attending college in pursuit of the “Mrs.” means the real purpose of four years of academic coursework is to find a mate — particularly one with a high earning potential. The “Mrs.” doesn’t require you tie the knot during undergrad (a time for sociality that marriage may impede); you just have to lock down a future spouse before anyone else in the post-grad “real world” gets a chance.
How lovely that proposition once sounded. Trust me, in spite of all the feminist principles and gender constructivism I claim to support, I’ve never been opposed to entertaining talk of marrying rich. In fact, some might say securing the bag through matrimony is the most feminist thing you can do. (Don’t bother searching the Internet for support of that claim. “Some” is just me half-joking about my gender politics.)
After spending time on the spousal hunting ground that is the college campus, I wager that seeking the “Mrs.” as an undergrad is a terrible idea, particularly on Harvard’s campus, but not because it’s a sexist idea that flies in the face of feminist efforts. The reality is that most college campuses lack eligible bachelors. Even beyond a heterosexual, woman-seeks-man context. Nobody should be seeking to find a future spouse in a fellow undergrad.
Science backs me up on this. As college students, we are burdened by personality traits and developmental circumstances that hamper our spousal potential. College brings a host of unique stressors and emotional challenges we’ve got to work through. If we can barely commit ourselves to eight hours of sleep, how can we commit ourselves to an impending lifelong partnership?
The blogosphere contends we’ve got a lot to learn in our 20s. We’ll probably be very different people by the time we finally tie the knot, so attaining the “Mrs.” may not appreciate in value. Our brains aren’t event done developing yet! We’re prone to succumbing to peer pressure, failure to seeing tasks through, and control by our impulses. Our brains still have a lot of developing to do. Between the tender ages of 18 and 22, we’re still emotionally immature. We’re rather selfish, hyper-competitive, and unempathetic — none of which bode particularly well for your sexual or marital satisfaction.
Harvard’s campus in particular fosters some potentially undesirable spousal traits. We intellectualize everything, using unnecessarily big words to analyze things that would be more enjoyable left alone. If you’re not convinced, reading The Crimson editorial section should be a strong enough deterrent. Try earning your “Mrs.” the Ivy Route and you might end up with a Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.
This is not all to say college folks are bad people for struggling, that the undergraduate population is entirely undateable, or that personal development and being in a relationship are mutually exclusive. Nor is it a call to close your legs. This is a warning — one I wish my high school teachers had given me — not to get your hopes up and not to spend your undergraduate years in nuptial planning.
Rarely is any issue black and white. There are a few decent people on this campus. But they’re probably either boo’d up or not looking to date you. If you’re in a relationship and have found “the one”: congratulations; I swear I’m not bitter; and thanks for taking the time to read anyway.
If not building the foundation for a holy matrimony, how is a college student to spend their time? Here are some things that are likely to go better for you than courting a Harvard student. First, try adopting a therapy animal. If the clean-up is too much to bear, try playing an instrument. The Harvard Band is doing pretty well without you, so you should probably just start your own. Finally, rumor has it God will always love you, regardless of what your title is or who your last name came from.
Hold off on the “Mrs.” for now. The pieces of paper that are B.A. or B.S. will get you farther than a marriage license anyway. But maybe not as far as an M.S. will (I’m talking about the master’s degree, of course).

The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers bargaining committee went to their first-ever bargaining session with the University in October bearing an 80-count wish list and cheering optimistic chants. Just a month later, they say those goals will likely be hard-won.
The committee wrote in an email to union members on Nov. 6 that their first two bargaining sessions — one in October and one in November — were marked by forceful pushback from Harvard administrators. In particular, the committee wrote the union took issue with University counter-proposals seeking to maintain existing procedures surrounding sexual harassment allegations and to exclude hourly workers from the bargaining unit.
Efforts to change Harvard’s grievance procedures surrounding sexual misconduct allegations have been a central pillar of HGSU-UAW’s contract goals. Before negotiations began, union members said bargaining for these changes would be among their first asks of Harvard — a strategy they have pursued.
The committee wrote in the email that “the administration dismissed our non-discrimination and harassment proposal” and responded by “offering just the current policies.”
“Our members have been loud and clear that the current system is broken, but the administration has so far refused to make any substantive changes to their policies,” the email reads. “Under their proposal, discrimination and harassment would not be subject to the grievance procedure.”
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an email that Harvard “is committed to the safety and well-being of all members of our community, which is which is why we have invested significant resources in recent years to strengthen our policies, grievance procedures, training and support.”
“Harvard's nondiscrimination and harassment policies are strong and clear and have been strengthened in recent years with vast community input,” she wrote. “Let there be no mistake that the University is actively engaged in negotiating this proposed article and more than 30 others that are currently on the table.”
HGSU-UAW is not alone among graduate unions in pushing for contract provisions related to sexual misconduct. Graduate unions at the University of Connecticut and New York University — both of which HGSU-UAW has cited in the run-up to negotiations — have successfully bargained for reforms in this area. The UConn contract allows union officials to advocate for members who have filed allegations of harassment with the university, and the NYU contract specifies that violations of its nondiscrimination agreement constitute grounds for a formal union grievance.
Administrators also disputed HGSU-UAW’s characterization of members’ workloads over the course of negotiations, according to the email from union organizers. To support their proposals, bargaining committee members recounted personal experiences they had asked union members to share with them.
Per the email, administrators allegedly called the testimony “a good story, if true.”
Despite their description of the University’s pushback, the bargaining committee will continue to marshal members’ stories, the committee wrote. The email ends with a call for additional accounts of “discrimination, harassment, unsafe working conditions, or unfair workloads.”
In response to the first two sessions, the bargaining committee also wrote it plans to ask Harvard to schedule longer and more frequent negotiations. Earlier this semester, HGSU-UAW members said they hoped to meet administrators five or six times before winter break.
“To reach an agreement in any reasonable time, Harvard needs to demonstrate that it is committed to addressing students’ demands and meet on a more frequent basis,” the email reads.
Bargaining committee member Madeleine F. Jennewein wrote in an emailed statement that, after receiving a “thoughtful proposal” from HGSU-UAW, the University proposed an “unacceptable” response.
“The administration has so far denied our proposal and instead proposed maintaining the status quo, which leaves survivors in the hands of a system that most student workers believe is ill-equipped to deliver a fair investigation and recourse,” Jennewein wrote. “We will continue to call on the administration inside and outside of the negotiation room to reach a fair agreement.”
Jennewein wrote it is “no secret” that some students feel “widespread dissatisfaction” with University procedures for responding to sexual misconduct allegations.
In her statement, Jackson wrote that while the University has “no desire to prolong this process unnecessarily,” it is “important to remember we are starting from scratch and care must be taken in drafting contractual language.”
“Our priority is to create an agreement that is fair for the university, the members of this union, and all the students we serve,” she wrote. “Let there be no mistake that the University is actively engaged in negotiating [articles surrounding grievance procedures] and more than 30 others that are currently on the table.”
The union and University have not announced the date of a third bargaining session.

To honor the life of emeritus Philosophy emeritus professor Stanley L. Cavell, Harvard’s Philosophy Department held a tribute at Memorial Church followed by an all-day conference on Friday and Saturday.
Cavell passed away on June 19. He was 91. Cavell was appointed to be a professor at Harvard in 1963 and published 18 books throughout his academic career. His academic research focused on applying philosophical concepts to film, theater, and other artistic works.
The event was attended by several faculty members in the philosophy department, including Philosophy Professor Richard Moran and acting Philosophy Chair Alison J. Simmons; former students and colleagues; as well as members of Cavell’s family.
Moran opened the tribute in Memorial Church late Friday afternoon, attesting to Cavell’s influence on academic philosophy and calling his writing a “model of passion, brilliance, and sheer beauty.” In a subsequent speech, Rabbi Matthew V. Soffer discussed Cavell’s legacy as an academic and as an individual.
“Certain characters are privileged with the grace of having their life lessons passed down to the next generation and the next,” Soffer said.
Cavell’s son, David F. Cavell, moderated Friday’s tribute, which featured speeches from the elder Cavell’s daughter Rachel L. Cavell, his son Benjamin W. Cavell, and his daughters-in-law Emily Cavell and Kate Cavell.
“We never really had to say goodbye to someone who left so much of himself behind,” David Cavell said of his late father.
Nancy F. Bauer ’82, a philosophy professor and dean of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University, spoke after the Cavell family members, highlighting Cavell’s exemplary conduct as a colleague.
“We learned from Stanley that believing in and reaching for our higher selves is of the utmost ethical importance,” Bauer said.
Saturday’s all-day conference — held in Emerson Hall — focused on Cavell’s academic influence and work. Conference attendees, many of whom had known each other and Cavell for years, waved at and greeted each other jovially before speakers took to the podium.
Eleven professors hailing from a variety of institutions took turns speaking about Cavell’s influence on both their intellectual pursuits and their personal lives.
Alice M. Crary ’89, a philosophy professor at Oxford University, spoke about Stanley Cavell’s empathy during her battle with depression and his role as officiant for her commitment ceremony with her partner. Crary recalled once revealing to Cavell her need for “someone to tell me that they believed I could do this.”
“He showed his appreciation of my words by responding to me in his slow, winning manner, ‘Anyday,’” Crary said.
The academic portion of the conference concluded with a round-table discussion of Cavell’s works held by seven of Cavell’s former colleagues. The discussion was followed by an evening reception in the Philosophy Department’s Robbins Library.
In an interview during the reception, Gary Ebbs, a philosophy professor at Indiana University Bloomington, recalled a poignant memory of his former colleague. After telling Cavell one time that he was feeling frustrated with philosophy, Cavell responded to Ebbs simply, “Yes, well, there’s also pleasure there.”
“This is the kind of remark for which he’s well known for,” Ebbs said. “To see what’s needed to make the transformation away from conventional ways of thinking to something that is more genuine, but takes courage to do. I think of that remark quite often.”
Conference attendee James Laff, who said he wrote his thesis on Cavell, said he hoped the philosopher’s work will continue to remain relevant in the future.
“Today was a great event, but hopefully the beginning of many such events,” Laff said. “What today symbolizes is the planting of the seed that will hopefully be the way in which Stanley’s work will continue to impact future generations of philosophers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 80 students and professors gathered on the top floor of the Smith Campus Center for the Association for Black Harvard Women’s 16th annual Road to Success Conference on Saturday afternoon.
The conference, sponsored by the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, the Undergraduate Council, and the national hospital network MedStar Health, aimed to facilitate pre-professional development and mentoring opportunities for black women on campus, according to organizers.
“I don’t think Harvard does enough to really prepare, particularly black women, for the unique challenges that come when we do enter spaces, whether it be finance, consulting, entertainment, whatever,” Kacey E. Gill ’20, President of ABHW, said. “Our goal for the event this year was really to make sure that we are trying to fill that gap.”
In contrast from past events, this year’s iteration of the conference featured guest speakers in addition to the recurring breakout discussion sessions, where participants could reflect on topics addressed during the conference.
“Those attending the event are also amazing people, so we want to make sure that they have the space to talk to and learn from each other,” Adinawa D. Adjagbodjou, Vice-President of ABHW, said. “Sessions cover topics on what to do once you have your foot in the door of your dream job, and how to continue growing.”
The conference’s featured keynote speaker was Loretta Y. Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer of MedStar Health. Walker said that when she started her executive career, there were few black women in senior level positions.
“I absolutely feel like the tides are shifting,” Walker said when asked about the role of women of color in the workplace. “I think the more diverse decision-making body is, in any industry, the better decisions you will make. It is really important to me when I get the opportunity to give back and to help others see a path that may not necessarily be clear to them that I take that extra step.”
Gill said after the event that the conference played a necessary role in addressing the many obstacles faced by minorities after college.
“I think that everyone who is a person of color, everyone who is a woman knows that entering the professional world has unique challenges,” she said. “Oftentimes people consider box braids to be unprofessional in the workplace, but that is one of the most important protective styles for black women.”
Several attendees said they went to the conference in hopes of gaining perspectives from currently successful professionals at the conference.
“I’m undecided in what I want to study,” Unique O. Hodge ’22 said. “Hearing from other black woman professionals is very important to me when I’m deciding how to channel my interests in my future career.”
Other students at the conference said that the program provided support in more ways that just pre-professional guidance.
“What is so empowering is that [ABHW] is not just about the professional side of college,”
Alexis A. Elliot ’22 said. “It is also a great place to build communities. The Association of Black Harvard Woman provides this space for people like me.”
Both women said they thought Harvard should encourage more events like this in the future.
When asked what advice she had for undergraduates unable to attend, Walker implored conference attendees and undergraduate women to take advantage of all the resources that the College provides.
“To all the young women of color,” Walker said, “I would say never fail to seize the opportunity to learn something new and meet different people. Always exhibit intellectual curiosity. It can only help you to continue to grow.”
Gill said that ABHW members are planning similar conferences and on-campus board meetings in the near future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Sociology Professor Devah I. Pager, a groundbreaking researcher, advisor, teacher, and mother beloved by her students and family, died on Nov. 2. She was 46 years old.
“She was a magnet,” Sociology professor William J. Wilson said. “Students wanted to work with her, not only because of her dedication, but her personality and sensitivity and the ease in which she related to students.”
Pager forged new methods in sociological research and authored a pioneering dissertation on racial bias in employment. She died in her home after a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer.
Pager’s 2003 dissertation earned recognition from the American Sociological Association as one of the best studies in the field. The paper, which prompted national media attention, found that white job applicants with felony records fare better in their search for employment than African Americans without a criminal background.
Pager’s research transcended academica and had a tangible effect on modern politics. In the mid-2000s, her research featured heavily in political promotions for “ban the box” legislation, which in some states bars employers from asking applicants for their criminal records.
Sociology Department chair Jason Beckfield said the dissertation was groundbreaking, calling it “amazingly rigorous and important.”
“That paper is one of the most highly cited papers in all of sociology,” Beckfield said. “It’s a very, very important piece.”
Wilson agreed.
“Her work provided some of the most rigorous research on the continuing significance of racial discrimination in the United States,” he said.
Pager’s work appeared widely in electronic and print media, earning attention from policymakers in the Bush administration. In 2007, former United States President George W. Bush signed the Second Chance Act, which created a program to help convicted felons re-enter the job market. Then-Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Jim Towey credited Pager’s 2003 dissertation with helping shape the legislation.
Early in her career, Pager earned a reputation as a highly competent researcher.
“She was extraordinary from the get-go,” Stanford Sociology professor David B. Grusky said. “Devah was a clear superstar, a brilliant person from the beginning.”
Friends said Pager inspired love and respect in students and colleagues throughout her career. As her illness worsened, nearly 100 Sociology Department students and faculty members gathered to film a video in Pager's honor, singing and dancing as they carried signs bearing slogans like “Thank You, Devah” and “We Love You, Devah.”
Her colleagues said Pager remained devoted to her students throughout her life. She continued to teach even as her cancer progressed.
“Students could always count on Devah Pager. She was always available, even during the period when she was suffering from her cancer,” Wilson said.
Government Department chair and professor of African and African American studies Jennifer L. Hochschild said she exchanged emails with Pager a few weeks before she died. The two wrote back and forth about the future of the graduate sociology seminar they co-taught.
Hochschild said Pager’s upbeat personality shone through her teaching.
“She had this enormously vivid, strong, warm personality, which came through very clearly,” Hochschild said. “She was very engaged with the students. She cared a lot about what they were doing.”
Grusky added that Pager’s energy stood out to her colleagues and students.
“She was willing to share her ideas and energy with everyone and anyone. She was beloved. She was truly beloved,” he said.
Pager is survived by her husband, Michael Shohl, and her son Atticus. A memorial service is scheduled to take place Dec. 1 at the First Parish Unitarian Church in Cambridge. The Harvard and Princeton Sociology Departments will host a memorial celebration for Pager on Aug. 9, 2019 in New York City.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to place two referenda challenging Harvard's investment decisions on the ballot for its presidential election this week.
The first referendum asks voters whether the University should “completely divest its endowment from holdings in the fossil fuel industry.” Administrators have repeatedly called fossil fuel divestment — a goal long sought by some student activists — unrealistic and misguided.
The second question asks whether Harvard should divest its “holdings in the Prison-Industrial Complex.”
Students in recent weeks launched an organized effort to convince administrators to reconsider Harvard's investments in prisons. A newly formed group called the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign held its first public event on Nov. 1, drawing roughly 100 attendees.
University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in an emailed statement last week that Harvard will continue to play a “crucial” role in “tackling” climate change, but will not divest from fossil fuel companies.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it,” she wrote. “Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.”
“And Harvard Management Company will continue to actively incorporate environmental, social, and governance factors – including climate change – into its investment work,” she added, referring to the group that shepherds the University’s endowment.
Asked in an October interview whether Harvard would consider divesting from prisons, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said shifting the endowment is not the appropriate mechanism to enact social change.
“The University should not use the endowment... to achieve political ends or particular policy ends,” he said. “There are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don't think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.”
There are two ways referenda make it onto UC ballots; either the Council can vote to add the questions — as happened with the divestment referenda — or the student body can vote to do so. Both referenda failed to garner the requisite number of undergraduate signatures — equal to 10 percent of the student body — before Tuesday evening’s deadline, the first time in multiple years that no referenda made it through the petition process.
UC referenda are typically meant to gauge student opinion on campus issues ranging from Harvard's sexual assault policies to more light-hearted initiatives including a past push to make the “Harvard Turkey” the University’s official mascot.
Students have weighed in on fossil fuel divestment before. In the 2012 UC election, 72 percent of voters — or roughly 2,600 students — voted in favor of urging the University to divest from fossil fuel companies. At the time, administrators said they had no plans to do so; though in 2017, HMC’s head of natural resources Colin Butterfield said Harvard was “pausing” investments in some fossil fuel companies for financial reasons.
University administrators have pursued a number of environmental initiatives in recent years. Earlier this year, former University President Drew G. Faust laid out an ambitious plan to make the University fossil fuel-free by 2050.
UC members said Sunday that, though they understand administrators’ long-standing objections to divestment in fossil fuels, they believe students should have a chance to weigh in on the issue.
“Even if I don’t know if it’s going to pass and I’m not sure if I’d support the referendum as is, I still think that we should give students a chance to express their voice,” said Elm Yard Representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22.
James H. Coleman ’21, co-president of the Harvard Environmental Justice group — which gathered roughly 400 signatures in an attempt to put the referenda on the ballot — said the recent presidential transition offered a perfect way for students to send a clear signal to administrators that they still support the divestment campaign.
“We believe that it is important, now more than ever, to put this on the UC ballot, because of the new administration of Larry Bacow and with the resurgence of the divest movement,” he said. “We believe it is every-important to have the students have another opportunity to tell the University....to believe they can invest in areas that are moral and sustainable.”
Salma Abdelrahman ’20, co-president of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, said at Sunday’s meeting that the campaign has so far mostly involved graduate students. A UC referendum, she said, would give undergraduates the ability to weigh in on the issue, too.
“We want undergraduate voices to be represented in the room and not just have this be a campaign that’s dominated by grad students,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Socialists converged on campus Saturday for the first Harvard-based New England Marxism Conference — and urged fellow attendees to resist the Trump administration.
The event — hosted for the first time by the Harvard International Socialists — included wide-ranging discussions on a variety of social issues. It attracted more than 200 attendees, who traveled from as near as Cambridge and as far as France to listen to panels such as “Capitalism and Climate Change” and “Intersectionality and Oppression.”
The Harvard-based group received assistance in organizing the conference from the International Socialist Organization, a socialist group that strategizes alternatives to capitalist institutions.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Andrew B. Keefe, the president of the Harvard International Socialists, said the conference had a strong connection to current activism at the University. Keefe cited several movements led by Harvard organizers, including members of the Student Labor Action Movement, who protested Harvard’s patronage of Marriott hotels last week.
“It’s really wonderful to be participating in an event like this at Harvard,” Keefe said. “We need to take all of these ideas and make life at Harvard and in Boston and beyond better for working people.”
Ashley Smith, a member of the International Socialist Review editorial board, opened the conference with a talk titled “Building a Socialist Alternative to Trump’s America.” In his speech, Smith said there is a pressing need for socialists to lead the resistance against the Trump administration due to frustration with the two-party system.
“We need confrontation. We need struggle,” Smith said. “We need to take down the Trump Administration.”
At the conference’s final event, Jen Roesch — the co-host of a socialist podcast titled “Better Off Red” — outlined the challenges facing organizers in today’s political climate in a speech titled “What Kind of Party Do We Need?”
Roesch advocated for a “radical and hopefully revolutionary” socialist party to meet the challenges of the Trump era. She also mentioned her frustration with politicians on both sides of the aisle.
In an interview after her talk, Roesch expressed hope for social transformation among a new generation.
“There's an entire generation of people who are clearly looking for socialism and looking for big answers, beyond just the ballot box,” she said. “I think people are trying to envision a whole different kind of society.”
Though similar conferences have been held annually for more than a decade around New England, this year’s iteration attracted a larger and younger audience, according to Akunna Eneh, a member of the International Socialist Organization and one of this year’s event organizers.
Keefe said he has noticed increasing enthusiasm for socialism across the country in recent years.
“You have membership in socialist organizations everywhere increasing,” Keefe noted. “[That’s] why our conference was so successful.”
Attendee Cobalt A. Tolbert said he traveled from Vermont to Harvard to connect with fellow socialists from outside his local organization.
Tolbert also said these conferences are “a lot of fun.”
David Wood, a Massachusetts resident and member of the International Socialist Organization, said he came to the event to strategize and debate with like-minded activists.
"I see this as an important place to share ideas for how we can win the movements we're a part of today, how we can defeat the emboldened right wing… to engage other people from around New England,” Wood said.
The Harvard International Socialists have participated in other campus events this year. During the September hearings on the nomination of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the International Socialists protested in Harvard Yard carrying signs reading “We Believe Survivors” to voice their opposition to the nomination.

The three presidential tickets running to lead the Undergraduate Council faced off in the UC-Crimson “Crossfire” Debate Saturday evening, sparring over controversial issues including the ongoing admissions lawsuit and the possible elimination of shopping week.
Current UC members made up two of three tickets that participated in the debate: Education Committee Chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Lowell House Representative Julia M. Huesa ’20, as well as UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20 and chair of the UC’s Student Life Committee Arnav Agrawal ’20. The outsider ticket included Daniel K. Ragheb ’20 of Currier House and Samyra C. Miller ’21 of Lowell House.
The ongoing lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants marked one of the central issues canvassed in the Crossfire Debate. All three tickets said they believe the University's repeated assertions that it does not discriminate — but disagreed over what the College and the UC should do in response to the suit.
Agrawal and Khoury said they supported Harvard’s plan, as stated during the suit, to “expand diversity and to implement affirmative action.”
“We believe that a part of this transformative experience we’ve had is being able to immerse ourselves in the diversity on campus, whether it’s racial, ethnic, religious, or so forth,” Agrawal said. “However, at the same time, we believe it’s also important the College is more transparent about how it makes decisions.”
Ragheb and Miller said that, while they also agree with Harvard, they believe that the UC should not take a formal position on the matter.

“Samyra and I believe that Harvard is in the right here,” Ragheb said. “But again, the UC isn’t supposed to be the voice of two people, it’s supposed to be the voice of an entire student body.”
Current UC President and Vice President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 have previously stated that the UC should not take a formal position on the admissions lawsuit.
Huesa said that, while she understands the rationale behind Zhang and Boucher’s position, she believes that it is important to support “communities of color [who] are under attack.”

“These are elected representatives who have political ideologies. And the fact that they all have a majority vote on something, that must mean they represent the majority opinion,” Huesa said.
Anticipated changes to shopping week also marked a key point of discussion. Faculty and administrators are currently weighing a proposal that would end the week-long period at the beginning of the semester during which students can freely walk in and out of classes before finalizing their enrollment.
While all three tickets indicated support for preserving shopping week, their approaches to addressing the issue varied.
For Palaniappan and Huesa, a “four-prong strategy” is the answer.
“We are targeting the alumni network, we are talking to the grad student union, we are talking to the faculty, and we are also mobilizing other students in order to address this issue,” Palaniappan said.
Agrawal spoke about his role distributing the student survey on shopping week and promoting a discussion in Leverett House between students and administrators.
Khoury cited actions she took to support shopping week while serving as UC treasurer.
“I increased the Education Committee funding by 150 percent so that they have those resources to lobby for [shopping week]," Khoury said.
Though Ragheb said he thinks the conversations surrounding shopping week are a good start, he said he would like to see more opportunities for the general student body to express their opinions.
“The UC should’ve given students on this campus a bigger role in doing this, more than just the listening conversations that we had,” he said.
All three tickets later said they favor the College’s sanctions on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, though they raised concerns over what they called the disproportionate impact the policy has had on female groups and female empowerment on campus. Since the penalties' debut over two years ago, every single one of Harvard's all-female social group has promised to accept individuals of all genders. By contrast, several all-male groups have vowed to fight the penalties to the bitter end.
Other topics discussed Saturday included a proposal floated by Ragheb and Miller to bring back hot breakfast in the upperclassman houses; a proposal by Khoury and Agrawal to change Pusey Library into a social space for first year students; and a proposal by Palaniappan and Huesa to offer social inclusion grants for undergraduate parties and social events.
Voting for the 2018 UC election begins Nov. 12 at 12 p.m. and closes Nov. 15 at 12 p.m. Results will be announced at 10 p.m. on Nov. 15.

On Sunday afternoon, the curtain fell on a record-setting season by No. 6 Harvard field hockey as the Crimson came up short, 1-2, against No. 3 Princeton in Harvard’s first-ever NCAA quarterfinal match.
In addition to earning its first-ever NCAA playoff win — a commanding 6-1 defeat of No. 9 Penn State (12-6, 6-2 Big 10) — Harvard (17-2, 7-0 Ivy) posted several other program records this season: most wins (17), longest win streak (14), highest national ranking (6), and most hat tricks (4).
“It was a really great season to be a part of,” co-captain forward Kathleen Young said. “What I was really proud about is how we were able to elevate our game with every competition, and we really rose up to challenges, whether it was BC, or Princeton the first time around. Even our loss to Maryland was really stepping out of our comfort zone as a team and kind of establishing ourselves as a winning program.”
Harvard’s seniors, who played their final game in a collegiate uniform on Sunday in Princeton, N.J., set a record of their own, notching 51 wins across their four years with Harvard, the most by any group in program history.
“I couldn’t be prouder of the seniors,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “They took a chance on Harvard field hockey. Five or six years ago [when the seniors committed], we were number 50 or number 60 in the nation, and the leaders established this program to what it is right now.”
The Crimson and Tigers’ goal-scoring abilities emerged as forces to be reckoned with over the course of the season, with 3.7 and 3.3 goals per game, respectively. However, in this matchup between two teams defined by offensive production, the season came down to defense.
A save by senior back Olivia Allin, the second of her career and the first save of the game by either side, shut down a chance from Princeton (15-4, 6-1) in the sixth minute and set the defensive tone for the half.
Both back lines were impenetrable for the first 35. The Tigers held Harvard to two shots and the Crimson returned the favor, allowing only five shots by Princeton. The half ended, scoreless, with no clear leader.
“I think all the seniors were thinking, as we stepped out onto the field for that last half, that it could and ended up being our last chance to play for Harvard field hockey,” Young said. “Even if we were going to lose that game, we were going to be proud of how we played, and proud of how we represented Harvard in our last time putting on the school uniform.”
A green card against the Tigers four minutes into the second half offered the Crimson an opportunity to build momentum. Carefully calculated passing outside the arc gave the Harvard time to set up. By the time sophomore midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen found junior forward and Ivy League scoring leader Maddie Earle in the box, everything was positioned perfectly.
Princeton’s green card expired, and Earle chipped a short pass to Young, who stretched and dove. The ball, tapped by Young’s stick, skimmed by junior goalie Grace Baylis and into the back of the net in the 42nd minute.
Unyielding defense from both sides marked the next stretch, with the Crimson managing one shot and the hosts two in the next 17 minutes. Then, a penalty was called on Harvard.
“I think we prepared well, and we were ready for [Princeton],” van Herwaarden said. “We got an unlucky momentum shift when they got [the penalty] stroke.”
Princeton gave the shot to sophomore midfielder Julianna Tornetta, who entered the game with a perfect four-for-four penalty stroke conversion this season. Despite freshman goalie Ellie Shahbo’s number one in the nation save percentage, Tornetta managed to sneak the ball past to tie the game.
Harvard shut down two penalty corners, but the third proved to be the charm for Princeton. Six minutes after her game-tying goal, Tornetta struck again. A behind the back slice to junior back Maddie Backsai, a long drive skirting by Shahbo, and Harvard’s fate was sealed. Neither side managed to get a shot off in the remaining five minutes before time expired.
“We all feel really fortunate to be part of the team this season,” said co-captain Kathleen Young. “When we all committed to this program [five or six years ago], we were ranked 50s, 60s…. To be here for that meteoric rise has been really special.”
With this season in the books, and with strong talent across the freshman, sophomore, and junior classes returning for 2019, the Crimson’s field hockey’s journey is far from over. Earle led the Ivy League in goals scored, with junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen second, while Shahbo led the nation in goals against average and save percentage.
“Although right now it’s painful, it hurts the way it ended, the future looks bright, and the season has told us that,” van Herwaarden said.
First, though, van Herwaarden plans to appreciate all they achieved in a truly historic season.
“I think it’s first time to celebrate what we were able to accomplish, and look at those things before we move on to what’s next,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I wanted to come to America to swim. That was my plan.”
Growing up in South Africa, freshman golfer Chloe Royston was always a tremendous competitor. In the classroom, she excelled as a student. In the pool, she aspired to become a Division I swimmer. Halfway through high school, however, she hit a major health roadblock and her athletic career was thrown into jeopardy.
Persistent ear infections and complications from Type I Diabetes forced her to give up her swimming career as doctors advised her to stay out of the pool. Under such conditions, one would probably assume that Division I sports were out of the picture — but not for Chloe.
“I always wanted to come to a Division I school for sports,” Chloe said. “[I] just changed sports in the middle of high school.”
Determined to reach the pinnacle of college athletics, she pivoted her focus to golf, a sport she had played all her life, but not yet at top competitive levels. Fortunately, she did have a mentor to help her through this daunting process: her brother, Greg Royston ‘18, 2017 Ivy League Player of the year in golf.
Golf runs in the family for the Roystons, so Chloe has always had experience. Over holidays growing up, she had gotten out on the course with her brother and picked up a strong repertoire of skills even before she transitioned away from swimming. That being said, the Division I pursuit presented a whole new set of challenges, and the learning curve was steep. As a swimmer, Chloe had reached the top of South Africa’s competitive ranks — she had made a name for herself as a prolific swimmer and earned a level of comfort with her craft that every athlete hopes to achieve after enough years of experience. With swimming now out of the question, Chloe had to return to square one.
“I had a bit of humbling experience having to go back to the beginning,” Royston said. “Having really been high up in competitive swimming, and then now having to start in the B-division again, was interesting, but I loved it. Now, looking back, I prefer golf to swimming.”
Coach Kevin Rhoads, coach of both the Harvard men’s and women’s golf teams, reflected on the rarity of Chloe in being able to achieve the swimming to golf transition so quickly and completely.
“That, in it of itself, is such an outlier — people don’t do that,” Rhoads said. “The fact that she was able to excel really speaks for, yes her physical talent level, but just what she’s like. She’s fearless and basically just sets her mind on stuff that she’s going to do and goes after it really hard.”
In the second half of high school, now fully committed to golf, Chloe had to push her game to the next level. Royston had a tremendous foundation from playing throughout her childhood, but she still needed that next level of precision in shot-making.
“Because I started so late, I didn’t have all the shots to start with, and I’m still learning,” Chloe said. “He would say, ‘Oh, just try this, just try that,’ and that really [helped] me develop as a player.”
Greg stressed that the key to helping someone learn new skills in golf is to take a trial-and-error approach. Because different players’ games can be very different, he felt that it was crucial to present Chloe with the range of different shots possible and allow her to find her own niche.
“I played more golf growing up; I was very passionate about it from a very young age,” Greg said. “I developed the feel and ability to see the shots, so maybe more than teaching specific skills, I encouraged her to try stuff. Golf is a game where different people achieve things in slightly different ways.”
Similarly, Rhoads emphasized that something he saw in Greg’s time at Harvard was his attention for detail and shot-making precision. According to Rhoads, in golf teaching circles in the last few years, there has been a huge increase in attention on standardized technique. Over the last few years, golf swings have generally grown to become more similar amongst players, which on one hand has brought new efficiency to the game. On the other hand, the trend has led to a decrease in crafty shot-making. Greg, however, was able to reconcile the efficiency with creativity.
“Greg really was able to work both of those big values,” Rhoads said. “He continued to get more efficient with his big technique, but he’s also a really, really creative player. He’s able to see shots and put those into physical manifestations better than most people of this newer, younger generation…[Chloe] is definitely able to bring some of that to the table, and if she continues to develop her game, I think she’ll just have more and more access to that.”
One specific area of the game that Greg tried to highlight to Chloe was the difference in short game approaches. Compared to other elements of golf, chipping and putting may be the most dependent on course and grass conditions. In South Africa, the tropical kikuyu grass, a tropical species is the norm, and the ball will generally sit relatively nicely on the grass for a solid lie. Conditions in the Northeast, however, can be significantly less temperate. The rough can be gnarly, and the ball can sink deep.
“The grass is very different in the U.S. compared to South Africa, so I struggled with my short game and chipping,” Greg said. “The ball would sit in the grass a little more than in South Africa.”
Chloe conveyed a similar thought, describing short game conditions as “particularly quite different compared to home.” Nonetheless, she mentioned that she values the opportunity to broaden her game to new conditions.
Realizing that Chloe would probably (and did) experience this challenge, Greg made sure to highlight it to her. That being said, he tried to make the lesson a more universal one than just a golf tip, hoping to remind her that challenges are not a reflection on ability.
“I told her to expect finding it difficult at the start and not to be too hard on herself,” Greg said. “If you’re more attuned to the change, you’ll know it’s not just that you’re all of the sudden struggling with chipping.”
More broadly, a lot of the advice Greg did strive to impart did in fact go beyond golf, addressing topics like positive mindset on the course and the transition to college in the States.
“I had no idea what Harvard was going to be like,” Greg said. “The whole experience was learning what Harvard was about. The Northeast can be very different from South Africa.”
In learning what Harvard was about, Greg reflected that one of the most important lessons he learned was a new mindset: an ability to to truly analyze practice and the game in a way that he hadn’t been exposed to before. He credits the coaches with teaching him this skill, one that can also be universalized to academics and broader life at Harvard. Chloe has seen this skill manifest in her life at Harvard in many areas of the transition to college, but especially on the course.
Although Greg and Chloe never did overlap at Harvard, she stressed that that didn’t mean he wasn’t a resource, as he always was just one phone call away. While she would have loved to overlap with him at least for a year, the fact that Greg had already graduated also gave a certain retrospect to his advice.
“I think this has allowed him to give even more advice looking back over his experiences,” Chloe said.
In giving advice, Greg too explained that he strayed away from incredibly specific details in order to avoid forcing his vision of Harvard onto her. Echoing a similar trend, Rhoads also noted that, from a coaching perspective, the staff will highlight the older sibling as resource but make sure that the experience is completely individualized.
“We also have a huge value for treating this as its own experience,” Rhoads said. “We try not to reference the older sibling on a regular basis.”
Reflecting on Greg’s advice about trying new approaches, staying resilient, and keeping a positive, focused mindset, Chloe appreciates that the words of wisdom have always been very applicable to her own experiences. In no way did she ever feel that Greg tried to force his four years onto her.
“He’s been very careful not to push his experience on me, which has been amazing, but at the same time been able to give me a lot of advice about everything,” Chloe said.
Outside of advice and guidance, friendly competition has contributed to both siblings’ respective successes. In fact, the siblings both mentioned how competition between them drives them to their bests. As Greg said, “golf can be anonymous,” and the bond between them helped to break down that anonymity. They haven’t been able to play together in a while living on different continents, but they both made sure to emphasize that they can’t wait for their next competition over the semester break.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the six freshmen joining Harvard’s storied squash program this year, three hail from Cairo, Egypt. They are the latest set of top recruits from a country that dominates the international squash scene.
Egypt cruised to the World Squash Federation World Team Championships last year and populates the top of the PSA World Squash Rankings, accounting for the top four men’s and the top three women’s squash players. The Middle Eastern country has been a squash superpower for decades, which junior Saadeldin Abouaish, the only non-freshman Egyptian on the squash team, partially attributes to former president Hosni Mubarak’s love for the game.
“It started in the ‘90s when there was a tournament in the pyramids,” Abouaish said. “We had one good Egyptian player at that time [Ahmed Barada] and he got a lot of publicity because the president was very into squash at that time too.”
Egyptian players are renowned for their exciting, attack-minded style of play. Admirers of creativity and flair are sure to be drawn to the Egyptian technique, which is set to become more prevalent at the college level as more and more Egyptian players make the move over to the United States.
“They are so skilled with the racket and are very offensive players,” freshman Marwan Tarek said. “They maybe aren’t as strong physically as Europeans or South Americans but they have the know-how to win.”
Freshman Hana Moatez said that squash is an expensive sport played mainly by wealthy people in Cairo and, to a lesser extent, Alexandria. But over time, Tarek claimed, it has become significantly more accessible for less well-off Egyptians.
“If you asked me 10 years ago I would have told you that it was only wealthy people playing squash in Egypt but now I think the availability of the sport has increased,” Tarek said. “There are now coaches who take less money. It’s become more for the people who are workhorses rather than just being for the wealthy.”
This accessibility has led to an explosion of participation in squash at the youth levels. And young Egyptian squash players have plenty of role models to look up to, which freshman Amina Yousry believes is a catalyst for her success on the squash court.
“We have many players who went down the same path before we did,” Yousry said. “They succeeded and we’ve grown up having big role models to look up to and follow their paths. Amr Shabana, Ramy Ashour, Karim Darwish to name a few. They are Egyptian squash legends.”
Among the scores of emerging Egyptian squash players are Tarek, Moatez, and Yousry, Harvard’s three standout freshmen. They have known each other for years and all three have played for Egypt in international competitions. Moatez and Yousry have competed against each other since they were nine years old. Abouaish, has also long known the younger Egyptians. He played on the same club team as Tarek in Egypt, and the two have been friends for nine years. But the decision to play squash for the Crimson was not equally easy for all of them.
“Since I was a kid I had my eyes on a few schools in the US since my brother moved here six years ago,” Yousry said. “I didn’t want to ditch academics or squash and I found it hard to do both in Egypt. Here in the US and especially at Harvard it’s way easier to balance between both.”
While Yousry knew for years that she wanted to play college squash in the United States, the decision was much tougher for Tarek and Abouaish.
“I wasn’t thinking of coming to a school in the US. I just wanted to finish my junior tournaments and go pro,” Tarek said. “But then I got an email from the Harvard coaches, Princeton coaches, and Yale coaches about coming to the US. I visited and felt so excited about coming here.”
Abouaish explained that he was extremely hesitant to join the Crimson because he was extremely close to his family and friends. In the end, he said he was convinced to come by Ali Farag ’14, whom he labeled a pioneer of Egyptian squash at Harvard. Two years later, he played a similar role to the one that Farag — currently ranked No. 2 in the world — played for him.
“I think me being close in age to the three freshmen allowed me to advise them and push them to come here,” Abouaish said. “It started with Ali and he kind of led the way.”
The four Crimson Egyptians universally agree that their time with the Crimson has been made much more enjoyable by the fact that there are other Egyptians around to support them and talk to them. Abouaish, the lone upperclassman, has been making Tarek feel at home and enjoys having someone to speak Arabic with. And the pair of freshmen women has the added benefit of entering college together.
“I’ve never been part of a team before so being here with international people and having one of my best friends [Moatez] along with me on the team is the best thing I have here,” Yousry said. “This is actually what’s keeping me going.”
There is no reason to believe that the pipeline from Egypt to Harvard’s squash team will close anytime soon. Given Egypt’s squash dominance and the Crimson’s recent success on the court — the women have won four straight Howe Cups and are on a 53 match winning streak, while the men have finished as national runner-ups to Trinity College twice in a row — it seems to be a connection that should endure going forward.

With The Game at Fenway, the ticketing process required precise coordination of friends’ schedules and arduous hikes across the river. Like everything else, though, Yale found a way to do it worse. We caught up with one frustrated Yalie for the scoop on how ticketing went for folks in New Haven this year.
Flyby: So, we heard the ticketing process at Yale was a bit difficult?
Michelle J. Fang: Yes! Basically, the tickets were sold at Payne Whitney Gym, which is the large gym here. My friends and I expected for there to be a booth outside the gym where we could line up for the tickets. When we got there, we did find a line out the door, only the booth wasn’t outside the gym. Instead, we had to walk through hallway after hallway after hallway, with a ton of people waiting everywhere. People had started camping out to get tickets starting at 2 a.m., so there were sleeping bags, homework, laptops everywhere...
2 a.m.? Last year we thought going from Cabot to Currier to buy a ticket off someone was a rough time.
Flyby: Wait…When you say that people “camped” out, does that mean that there weren’t enough tickets for everyone?
MJF: There was definitely a fear that we wouldn’t get a ticket. At the end of the day, they didn’t sell out until around 2 to 3 p.m., so it probably wasn’t worth setting up camp at 2 a.m., but they made it seem like being there hours before was necessary. There was literally a Facebook event that was called “Camping Out for Harvard-Yale Tickets.” But I know some people that wanted a ticket and didn’t end up getting one…
Pro tip: ask a Harvard friend to put you on a House mailing list. We hear there are tons of tickets being…given away. Not sold! That’s an Ad Board-able offense, and we are rule-abiding students.
Flyby: Do people have a theory on why there were a limited number of tickets?
MJF: We thought it was because there isn’t enough room [at Fenway]. Some people say Fenway is bigger, some people say it’s smaller...
Smaller? We see why you guys go to Yale...
Flyby: Moving on, was there anything else related to ticketing that was annoying, besides the camping out part?
MJF: At one point, someone sent a very official-looking prank email saying that tickets would be offered in a “flash sale” sort of thing across campus. People went to the location hoping to secure tickets and found paper taped all over the floor. Needless to say, people weren’t too happy.
Ah yes, Yale kids too eager to “flash” — sounds familiar. 
So sure, having the Game at Fenway is making our lives a bit more difficult (or a lot more, if you go to Yale). The bright side? Considering Yale’s inferior ticketing process, we may have a chance at winning the Game after all. In comparison, making the trek to the Murr Center all the way across the Charles wasn’t so bad after all.

Harvard-Yale szn is back again and we’re already hype for all the game day festivities. If you’re anything like us, you know that watching the weird things that happen around game time is even more fun than the game itself, whether that be the latest Harvard-Yale pranks, the most wild tailgaters, or the best signs in the stands. What better way to prepare for all this inevitable craziness than with a look at some of the weirdest things to happen at past games?
Papier-mâché Bulldog Abuse?
With Yale having won nearly every single match leading up to the 1908 game, the pressure was on for Harvard to finally make a comeback. Legend has it, the football coach at the time strangled a papier-mâché bulldog and drove around Cambridge with it attached to his car to raise morale and get the team ready for The Game. Some even say that he actually strangled a live bulldog, but we’re gonna assume that this one at least is a little too weird to be true.
A 4 a.m. Band Performance
Forget the weekly trek back to your dorm from Pfoho Igloo; in 1962, Harvard took late night entertainment to a new level with a band parade through New Haven – at 4 a.m. Sure the police and locals weren’t too happy (er, seven band members were tossed in jail), but what better way to get ready for a game day win! We can only hope that this night also ended with a midnight snack at some Jefe’s equivalent. After the members made bail, of course.
Taking L’s… Even from the Team Manager
If you’ve seen any CEB poster you already know this game is all about “Payback Time” after a two-year Yale winning streak, but this was not the case in 1952. With Yale ahead by nearly 25 points, they decided to add insult to injury and put in their student team manager to catch a two-point conversion on Harvard’s own turf. Let’s just cross our fingers we don’t get a repeat of that this Saturday.
MIT Joins the Party (...for some reason)
As tensions grew between Harvard and Yale for the 1982 Game, MIT apparently felt left out and decided to join in on the fun. In what they like to call one of their most iconic “hacks” (because of course that’s what MIT would call pranks), halfway through the game a giant weather balloon with “MIT” written on it rose out of the ground and popped, leaving powder all over the field and anyone nearby. With many newspaper articles declaring that they stole the show, and even a press conference proclaiming this the “the greatest college prank of all time,” we’re glad MIT got to feel included.
After seeing some of the weirdest things to happen at past Harvard-Yale games, maybe your moderately-impaired decisions on gameday will seem a little less crazy. Though let’s be real, the consistently weirdest thing about The Game must be the Yale students. Imagine choosing to wear Yale Blue over Harvard Crimson.
