VENICE, Italy—On November 14th, 2009, an ironic protest was held in Venice: the funeral procession of the “city of Venice” borne in a hot pink coffin. This semi-satirical event was organized and carried out by Venessia, a somewhat renegade group of concerned Venetians devoted to preserving Venice as a functioning city. The funeral was inspired by the city’s census count drop to just under 60,000 inhabitants, the protesters arguing that a city of less than 60,000 is more of a village. Though this number rather snobbishly discounts the Venetians living on the Lido and surrounding islands, the protest evocatively highlights the strangeness of living in Venice, a strangeness that surpasses even its beauty.
The city is visited by 18 million tourists every year, a number that astronomically exceeds the number of people actually living in the city. When divided by the number of days in the year, this number averages out close to 60,000.  The city is thus overwhelmed by masses of visitors, many of whom seem vaguely bored, yet desperate to “do” Venice, to see it all—an impossible, and seemingly shallow goal.
But while tourists are the economic lifeblood of the city, their presence has rendered the city too expensive for the average Italian—leading some to categorize it as merely a theme park. An Italian recounts being asked by American tourists “excuse me, when does Venice close?” While such a question may seem insensitive or unintelligent, from a more philosophical perspective the question is entirely pertinent. What will happen now that Venice is a city that lives by parodying itself? Can it survive as a viable, living city?
In contrast with the mobile hordes of strangers who every day lay siege to the city exists another Venice. The quiet, self-effacing Venice, the Venice that groups like Venessia are trying to preserve. In many ways the critique that Venice is a “village” is all too apt. At night, a serene silence, such as one might find in a remote mountain hamlet, descends upon the darkened, narrow alleys, punctuated only by the susurration of water in the canals and the inebriated shouts of foreigners and students as they search for bars, lost in a truly Byzantine maze of canals and alleys. In fact, this silence surpasses anything one might find on the mainland: Here, the only motors are on boats. During the day, just as in a village, you meet everyone in your immediate neighborhood, seeing them every day on the vaporetto or as you go about your daily routine. This is the “real” Venice, augmented in glamour by its status as an “international city,” the Biennale, and the Venice Film Festival.
Just two centuries ago Venice was a city to contend with, a city that had to be vanquished by none other than Napoleon, a city with its own peculiar but highly successful form of independent governance, a city that defied every rule of logic, forcing its existence against the will of the Pope, empires, and the sea. All this, and to be, almost coincidentally, a city that some claim is the most beautiful in the world. To end like this, vanquished by modernization, with the images of Kate Moss and Emma Watson pouting at us from giant billboards that cover storied buildings such as the Accademia and the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, seems an ignominious end to a city that ruled the waves for so many centuries—killed, as it were, by the world’s relentless fascination with its beauty.

FREELAND, Mich.—This is the heartland. It’s a part of the country many Harvard students may not be familiar with. When I accepted my internship here as a polymer-chemist-in-training, I was more than a little bummed that I’d tacitly accepted living in a Michigan cornfield (not a joke). It’s one thing to read the daily reports of Michigan’s death spiral in the New York papers; it’s another to see it firsthand. The state has been hit hard by recession and perhaps harder by decades of painful decline before it. The scars are everywhere—shuttered factories, foreclosed homes, abandoned small businesses, decaying barns, crumbling roads. The list goes on.
But in the face of it all, the mid-westerners I’ve met show uncommon grit. Despite the challenges, or maybe because of them, they hang on to a uniquely American viewpoint: It can all be fixed. As the state arrives at something of a slow recovery, there’s a sense that what happened in Michigan wasn’t an inevitable economic reality. Rather, it was complacency that led Michiganders to unwittingly turn their backs on the promise of America. All that’s needed is a fresh embrace of innovation and hard work.
But is American manufacturing really on the cusp of a great renaissance? It’s hard to say. The emotion here isn’t exactly the infectious hyper-optimism of Silicon Valley. It’s more of a dim but steady faith that things are about to be set right. There’s also an intangible apprehension, and it gives pause. No one quite knows just when industry will make good on the peoples’ optimism. For now, hope seems propped on a very visible glut of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signs and a few proverbial bridges to nowhere—but at least it’s out there.
Back east, most people I know are resigned in their vision of a labor-lite future. It’s an easier belief to hold, but it’s counterproductive to the billions of private-sector dollars invested in reshaping American manufacturing, nor does it give a fair shake to the people of Michigan and their gritty determination to preserve their livelihood.

CAMBRIDGE, MA—As my summer of copywriting and classes in Cambridge dwindled to a close last week, two inevitabilities approached: the beginning of class at the end of August, and a visit from my parents and younger brother.
Let it be known that my parents are upstanding people, and I love them. That said, nothing brings out the dormant thirteen-year-old in me like a visit from them. Suddenly, quirky habits become intolerable, and being cool—something I like to think I don’t care about—becomes critically important, for my parents are almost criminally uncool, in the shallowest sense of the word.
Yet sometimes I wish I could be more like them. Where I am cynical and condescending, they appreciate everything. On their visit, we ate at Crema Café, The Other Side on Newbury, and a hole-in-the-wall eatery in the North End called Ida’s. The food ranged from below-average to mediocre, but my parents and brother have a habit of declaring as they sign the check that every meal was the best they’ve ever had, no matter the quality. Since childhood, I’ve found it irritating and insincere—evidence that clearly, I am a changeling and belong with a clan of discerning, hypercritical gourmands. But this weekend, I mused: What if every meal I ate was actually better than the last? Every tourist trap the best I’ve ever been to? What if everything I did was the best thing ever?
It seems like a pretty pleasant way to live, even at the risk of my offspring considering me criminally uncool.
In that spirit, I decided that damn it, I was going to enjoy our excursion to Walden Pond. Admittedly, the trip had been my idea: A nature-lover I am not, but living in Cambridge for four years without paying homage to Thoreau seems a bit sacrilegious. But I remained apprehensive: The place is a tourist Mecca, and the prospect of forty minutes in a rental car with my dad’s show tunes was less than appealing. I won’t even go into my brother’s obsession with using my phone’s voice recognition feature to place calls to various parts of the female anatomy.
I was right to be apprehensive. Although it was certainly possible to find a quiet corner, the pond was flooded with visitors; the show tunes were annoying as expected; and despite my attempts to be patient, I finally snapped my phone shut after my brother’s edict that it “call tits.”
And I was right to suggest the trip in the first place: The picnicking hordes aren’t enough to erode Walden’s serenity. I had more fun than I’ve had in months gossiping with my mom, and convincing my brother that a real man would be able to catch his sister a fish with his bare hands (he tried for over an hour).
The more time I spend at Harvard and in Cambridge, the more of a culture shock my family becomes—a pocket of earnestness in my increasingly jaded life. It’s a universal kind of angst, but no less potent for its universality. And yet it has its uses—since my family left on Monday, I can’t help but think that Cambridge may well be the best city ever, and Walden the best pond (for whatever that’s worth).
Here’s hoping it lasts.

DRANCY, France—The town of Drancy is a glum, dismal Parisian suburb a world away from the arrestingly beautiful city just a few stops south on the commuter rail. At first, it seems indistinguishable from the rest of the banlieue: poor, squalid, and populated primarily with immigrants. French (at least from what I heard) is spoken only in broken accents if at all; trash litters the streets.
A sort of Parisian analog to what F. Scott Fitzgerald calls the “Valley of the Ashes” in The Great Gatsby, Drancy is a town that, like so many others in the immediate vicinity of its capital, France would wish to forget. But something about Drancy’s particular past—and, I am sorry to relay, its present—demands the utmost amount of national and, perhaps, even worldwide attention.
Just about five hundred yards from the town center, a concrete, U-shaped structure frames a rectangular park. Ordinary enough, at least until it becomes clear that this building formerly served as the most notorious of the major internment camps from which the French government willingly deported approximately 75,000 Jews during World War II (some 67,000 of whom left from Drancy). Today, however, this same building is neither museum nor memorial but a low-rent apartment building, where, presumably, families share meals and children blow out birthday candles.
I have to wonder: Do the residents know that 40 to 50 internees were shoved into each room before those rooms became their living rooms and dining rooms? Do they know that their building was once, in the words of historians Robert O. Paxton and Michael R. Marrus, an “antechamber to Auschwitz?” Do they even care?
Of course, at one end of the park, there is a memorial to what Drancy was seventy years ago, but it feels oddly placed, almost an afterthought. A reconstructed cattle car may elicit the terror of the crimes conducted on the spot, but the vitality of the apartment building evokes an eerie juxtaposition of the darkest history with the most seemingly indifferent present, a time in which people are somehow permitted to live in such a place.
I should mention that I am not one of those people who thinks that the French government attempts to hide its indifference and complicity during World War II. As Susan R. Suleiman points out in Crises of Memory and the Second World War, the Vichy years have become somewhat of a national obsession in France since the mid-1970s, and the highly public trials of various criminals such as Klaus Barbie in 1987 and Maurice Papon ten years later have only fanned the flames of shameful awareness and embarrassed curiosity.
Nevertheless, the question still remains: how, in a nation so conscious of its past, can Drancy be allowed to be what it is today, a home as any other? It should be obvious that using the structure of an internment camp as everyday living quarters is nothing short of the utmost disrespect, for an “antechamber to Auschwitz” can never really cease to be what it once was. In other words, Drancy is not a lease; it cannot change from an internment camp into an apartment building in the same way that a butcher’s shop can easily become a florist’s.
I am not saying that the building should be torn down—quite the opposite. It should remain forever as a memorial to those victimized in a time when the universalist nature of French republicanism was invalidated and when what was perhaps Europe’s most progressive nation-state betrayed a huge number of its own citizens. Anything less would be (and is) entirely inappropriate.
In that sense, the French government would do well to liberate Drancy for a second time—this time from the most flagrant of indecencies.

ZURICH, Switzerland—Because our team—the Embrach Mustangs of the Swiss National Baseball League—has a weekend off from games, my teammates and I decide to go to Germany to see Italy play England in the European Baseball Cup.  Here in Stuttgart, on a hillside field, the Azzurri are whupping the Brits.
Looking at the English side it seems obvious. They have sloppy one-button jerseys, the type that Sunday softball leagues get for their players when the pizzeria withdraws its sponsorship.  And though the Italians may be winless in twentieth century armed conflict, they’ve learned how to play this baseball game. Maybe it’s the appearance as hitting coach of the indomitable Mike Piazza, a real pro brought over from my home in New York City, where he was everyone’s childhood hero.
After the game, after I get Piazza’s autograph (Me: Mr. Piazza can you sign my program, I’m a big Mets fan!  Mike: Sweet), we’re getting ready to head back to Switzerland, and there’s another reason other than the fact that I’ve run out of Euros that I’m feeling regretful.
Baseball is a game of regret. No one knows this more than the European baseball player.
Everyone’s got a story, me most of all, to explain how they ended up not in the pros or on their national team but in this halfway-league blinking brightly on the other side of the Atlantic, green mountain paradise to be sure but professional baseball purgatory.
Everyone’s got something a little wrong with them—a hitch in the swing, a false step on the basepaths—to limit a baseball career. They say that if you’re good baseball finds you anywhere, but if you’re only pretty good, the sport is merciless—and there are a thousand purgatories like this one on green-filled paradises the world over.
Watching the national teams brings it all out, because while the Italians are very good, I don’t have to lie to myself too much to pretend that if things had been different, I could have been a backup infielder for the English. It’s lying, and it’s probably not true, but these are the lies we tell ourselves over here while we play sort-of-professional baseball, trying to decide if we’re fulfilling little lifelong dreams that we had when we were whiffle-ball children.
And it’s difficult because the adult world is pulling so hard. My American teammate confesses that he doesn’t even love baseball like he used to. For God’s sake, baseball got us to Europe, how much more do we want? I was in Paris last week. I’m living in a room where I wake up to the find-me bells of sheep. I spend my days on the lake in Zurich, swimming, watching the way the water goes so far into the mountains that the earth turns underneath. At night they light up the bridges and people dance samba over the Limmat.
But even still the most exciting thing comes, that night at a beer festival in Wil, with other Swiss kids our age. They’re friends of a teammate, so they know all about baseball.  They know that we play for real teams. We tell them to come to our games, like major leaguers signing baseballs with their phone numbers for the pretty girls—and in my Under Armor sweatshirt and these couple of people around us I feel pro. Right now, in a town square on top of cobblestones hundreds of years old, far from baseball field lights or morning practice, I pretend that I hit the way Mike Piazza does. That I’m 6-3 and 220, the new hot-shot kid called up to the bigs. It’s easy here where no one’s checking. It’s why we hide ourselves so far away. Here, baseball is a dream, a little-kid thing getting harder and harder to let go.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA—I sat awkwardly, trying to think of an answer to a question I had now been asked one too many times: “How are you going to integrate your summer experience into your life at Harvard and beyond?”
It was my last week in Santiago, Chile, and I—along with several other students in my summer program—was meeting with representatives from Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies to talk about how we were going to apply what we’d learned in the past eight weeks. When it was my turn to speak, I quickly mumbled something about looking into some history classes on Latin America and sighed in relief when they nodded and moved on to the next student.
Even now that I’m back home in sunny California, scanning through the course catalogue and making impressively vague plans for the future like “spend some time in China, doing something,” I still can’t come up with a good answer to that question.
I landed in South America on a whim, deciding to intern at an English-language news agency in Chile only after other summer plans fell through. I didn’t know a thing about the country before I arrived, except that it once had a dictatorship, it produced wine that had its own section at Whole Foods, and it was on the other side of Argentina.
I learned a great deal over the course of two months. I followed political developments in Chile, I researched inter-state tensions between it and its Latin American neighbors, and I became well acquainted with issues like income inequality, classism, and the legacy of human rights violations. Oh, and I now speak conversational Spanish with Chilean slang.
Has any of this influenced my “personal, academic, and/or professional goals?” asks the summer funding questionnaire I’m supposed to fill out by Aug. 27.
Well, not really. And is that a bad thing?
On one hand, I understand where these kinds of inquiries are coming from. My interrogators want to make sure they haven’t thrown money at me to go live and work in Chile just to have me continue on with my life as if nothing happened.
On the other hand, I’m constantly frustrated by the narrowness with which Harvard defines how experiences “impact” students. There may be no direct connection between what I did this summer and what I do this semester, or next year, or after I graduate. At this point in my life, this summer isn’t specifically contributing to some kind of bigger picture for my future.
All I can say is that this summer was amazing and fulfilling, and that it was valuable for those reasons alone. I’d be surprised if it doesn’t have some kind of effect on my life, even if I can’t put a finger on it yet.
The penultimate item on the questionnaire says, “Comment on how this experience will influence the remainder of your time at Harvard.”
My answer: I don’t know. But I know it will!

NEW YORK, NY—On 79th street, opposite New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s townhouse, over 50 people stood chanting behind a police line: “The blood; the blood; the blood is on your hands!” The blood they lamented was that of geese.
Since the January 2009 plane crash in which Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger landed his plane safely on the Hudson River after colliding with a gaggle of geese, which destroyed the plane’s engine, the city and geese have not been the best of friends. Legislation, approved by Bloomberg authorized the United States Department of Agriculture to remove all geese from within five radial miles of airports. Rather than move the geese elsewhere, the city has gone the route of extermination—or as one protestor put it, “gassing geese to death.”
This protestor, Wayne Johnson, whose business card lists him as a psychotherapist and who says he has been a member of animal rights groups for over 20 years, leant in conspiratorially as he explained the situation.
Under the cover of night, Johnson says, the USDA, which works in tandem with the city, uses bread to lure geese toward trucks that contain gas—“the same elements that were used in the World War II gas chambers.” Last year, nearly two thousand geese met death in the trucks.
This entrapment is even more unfair because from early June through mid-July, geese moult, meaning that last year’s feathers are shed and replaced with new ones. During this period, geese are unable to fly.
The tales of these late-night animal-nappings leave me far less elated than “The Ugly Duckling”, the only other story I know of that centers on birds. But I agree with Bloomberg on the simple principle that it is better to have fewer birds in the sky than to have a plane crash into the river, and it seems those are the options being weighed.
But Johnson—who stood among a ragtag crew, waving hand-made posters—had a simple explanation for why relocation, the main alternative to the gassings, hasn’t taken hold: “People don’t like their poop,” he said. “Poop has become a capital crime.”

MALABO, Equatorial Guinea—When a friend first told me about Pedro*, I was immediately captivated by his personal biography. The son of a Spanish mother and an Equatoguinean father, Pedro is what locals here call, perhaps anachronistically, a mulatto—a “mixed” person.
But it wasn’t merely the legacy of Spanish colonialism captured in Pedro’s DNA that enticed me to meet him last weekend. Rather, I learned that Pedro, raised and schooled in Spain, had come back to the country of his father to work and raise his own family. To me, Pedro’s story seemed like the exemplification of the “brain drain” in reverse. I surmised that, having come back to Equatorial Guinea, Pedro gave up what is, in materialistic terms, a comparably more secure life in Spain.
In fact, Pedro used the same phrase—“anti-brain drain”—to characterize himself. Instead of reaping the fruits of his immigrant father’s move to Spain, Pedro told me that he had opted not to follow in the footsteps of his older brothers and make a life for himself in Madrid or Barcelona. He wanted to invest his own human capital in Equatorial Guinea, where his paternal grandmother still collects wood for cooking and continues to bathe in a stagnant stream near her rural home, he said.
But if Pedro’s conception of the brain drain in reverse is that which applies to all former expatriates and their descendants who return to this country, then Equatorial Guinea ought not to rejoice anytime soon.
After about an hour of conversation, Pedro began to speak very candidly. Living here is “shit,” he said, before adding (and later showing me) that he has two large-scale business projects in the works: a hotel and an apartment complex for foreign workers.  Having invested a personal fortune in both ventures and having “tolerated” life in a developing country to see them to completion, “no one can spite me for driving a Ferrari,” Pedro said.
The presence of foreign companies—mostly American oil giants, including Exxon Mobil—in Equatorial Guinea is stifling, to say the least. These corporations have such a stranglehold on the Equatoguinean economy and exist in such high numbers throughout the country that many locals call Malabo—the epicenter of this foreign investment—a “mini-America.” That American flags hang below many taxi rearview mirrors here speaks to the validity of this claim.
My observations aren’t meant to be self-righteous. Rather, I (optimistically) hope they induce serious reflection. Equatorial Guinea suffers from a dire lack of basic infrastructure. From hospitals to schools, the country’s relatively small population lives in an ironically impoverished state—ironic because Equatorial Guinea possesses enviable supplies of natural resources, including oil, gas, and gold.
The regrettable reality is that this wealth has by no means benefited Equatoguinean society like it could. For one, blame the fact that one of Sub-Saharan Africa’s most money-hungry dictators, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, reigns supreme in Malabo.  But there’s also something to be said about American complicity: Under President Obiang’s watch, American oil companies are exclusively exploiting the country’s vast energy resources, prompting our government to turn a blind eye toward the rampant inequality and dearth of democracy that are hallmarks of this country.
In light of such a bleak (and well-documented) picture, to learn of Pedro’s definition of anti-brain drain was disheartening. Pedro isn’t “investing” in Equatorial Guinea by helping to build the country’s primitive health care system or insufficient education sector. He, just like the thousands of American and Chinese foreign workers here, is merely investing his human capital into the same system that continues to ensure extreme wealth for the few and inhibiting impoverishment for the masses.

PARIS, France—Twenty-eight years ago, on July 14, 1982, the auburn-haired Odile Hellier opened her bookshop, the Village Voice.
In a city that was already no stranger to the Anglophone bookstore, another would-be temple commemorating the Lost Generation might have seemed trite and, indeed, might not have lasted. But the Village Voice was not conceived as a memorial to the past.
Through a careful selection of titles, Ms. Hellier said that her shop was imagined as a means of presenting the American political and intellectual vitality of the present to a customer base that may or may not, for instance, have had any idea what or who Gloria Steinem was. In other words, it was supposed to show the tired, complacent Paris of the early 1980s the richness she had absorbed in the decade she spent in the United States in the 1970s—an image of a nation transposed into bookshop form, more or less.
“I thought that France would have changed a lot in the 1970s,” she told me recently. “In fact, it had changed—but not that much. I felt that it was stuck.”
Living in Washington, D.C. in those years, she said, was a transforming experience, during which she saw first hand the Vietnam demonstrations, the internecine struggles of the feminist movement, the awakening of the gay rights cause, the rise of Native American consciousness, and, of course, the power of African-American culture.
“When I came back to Paris, all that richness was not here,” she said. “I felt like creating a bridge between the two cultures.”
It’s an interesting idea, representing the essence of a culture through the books on your shelves. And, as a customer at the shop since at least before my voice changed, I can only say—without being too overdramatic—that the image of America the Village Voice presents is the same America I wish I could call my own.
When you walk into the shop, there’s a table piled high with, more or less, every recently released book you must read should you wish to consider yourself a semi-sentient being. This summer, for instance, there was Alan Brinkley’s biography of Henry Luce, Shlomo Sand’s polemic about the origins of the Jewish people, and Peter Carey’s parody of Tocqueville’s journey through America.
That, in a nutshell, is what is so attractive about the Village Voice: with a refreshing lack of pretension, it nevertheless presupposes a certain level of intelligence among its customers, even the ones who just want to buy a book and go about their business. I, for example, learned my lesson when I was in ninth grade, waiting in the check out line. The man behind the counter made some jab about someone called Henry Miller, and I didn’t laugh because I thought it was some sort of inside joke.
Needless to say: Excoriation. Was. Received. (And, for the record, he required my mother to buy me The Tropic of Cancer, which I actually still have on my bedside table at home but, admittedly, still have yet to read.)
Nevertheless, the America that the Village Voice works so hard to re-create (even through books that have little to do with the United States)—the America of the Mary McCarthys and the Rienhold Niebuhrs, the Cornel Wests and the Betty Friedans, a culture of reading, of discussion, and, above all else, of sustained thought—is not (and probably never will be) the predominantly anti-intellectual America in which I grew up, where reading is an assignment and thinking the process by which a perceivable objective is attained.
The Village Voice, if not an entirely accurate intellectual portrait of today’s United States, is still enough to make any American proud, even of a country that does not quite exist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MUMBAI, India—I’d been dreaming of swimming through a vast black sea, and in the morning my bed was an island. Water from the night’s rains had ruptured the ceiling, miraculously leaving me untouched. At the same time, not a drop of water flowed from the pipes.
Monsoon weather could make this summer in my Bombay flat difficult. Luckily, despite my not being a priest, a male, or even a believer, Societas Verbi Divini—an international organization of missionaries—opened its residence to me.
As the cook brought out tea and jackfruit in bite-size slices, salmon-pink and sweet to taste, one of the priests, a family friend, would talk about his work in Munich. He had not liked Germany; it had been a bureaucratic country, with weather (and relationships) that seemed cold. His heart belonged to India. He especially loved the villages, to which he would return immediately if the church would let him. Everyone took things into their own hands there—once he’d illegally blasted open rocks to extract water; another time he’d realized 35 motorbikes had materialized in the impoverished village because some enterprising young men had stolen them from town. There’d been a police round-up of the thieves (with whom he clearly sympathized) and an escape from the single-room, four-barred jail, the men racing through the forest in pitch darkness. No policeman had ever returned to the area for fear of being killed.
The good and the bad mingled crazily in these stories, in which morality seemed so prey to circumstance. Who is to say that innate moral qualities exist at all? I ventured. But he was adamant: “A source exists outside us that fills us with goodness.”
Occasionally we sidled toward the void of theodicy, which fascinated and troubled us both. I brought in Augustine, Nietzsche, Descartes, other Western thinkers. But they were a tired arsenal and crumbled like dust in my hands, for he never answered my arguments with counter-arguments. “See,” he would say, then draw a metaphor, transforming a question into images or some kind of symbol. When I asked what he meant by goodness apart from good actions, he replied: “In each of us there is a diamond.”
As an alternative to what he flatteringly called “my” philosophers, he handed me Tagore’s Gitanjali, with its introduction by Yeats, and a book of discourses by the Swami Vivekananda. But don’t read too much, he warned—it wasn’t necessarily good for the mind without experience. While he was speaking I opened the Swami’s book at random and immediately fell upon this: “You have first to throw books overboard. The less you read of books, the better for you; do one thing at a time. It is a tendency in Western countries, in these modern times, to make a hotchpotch of the brain; all sorts of unassimilated ideas run riot and form a chaos without ever obtaining a chance to settle down and crystallise into a definite shape.”
Trying to keep an open mind, I went to a yoga center he recommended, where a woman swathed in the complicated, womblike folds of a white sheet took questions. The lights were then switched off and soft music piped in; all those present were asked to stare at a point of light in the center of a red egg radiating green rays, reading “SUPREME BEING” in English and Hindi. Within the dimness the pinpoint appeared to pulse and the rays to undulate. “Do you know what is meant by the pinpoint of light,” the lady’s voice floated around—or through—us. “What is meant is—God.”
This was not Christianity at all; nor did it convince me. But it was one of the many dogma-transcending beliefs I found the priests could hold, including Marxism (at the SVD ashram in the Goan jungle where I stayed) and faith in the guru Sai Baba.
Coming back to America, and Harvard, will mean returning to a different kind of island. Events will operate according to an analytical verbal logic; practically, things will probably work. But that does not mean there will not still always exist this place—where, though there is a God, though there are many gods, all things are still permitted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BEIJING, China—In a province that most people would never be able to point out on a map, eight of us Harvard juniors sit quietly, draped over a separate piece of rosewood furniture in the hotel room. It’s the fifth mandatory reflection session of our trip, a nightly ritual the administration created in hopes of broadening our understanding of China by probing us with pseudo-profound, dead-end questions (My personal favorite: What is China?). Every one of these meetings passes in uncomfortable silence. After all, what is there left to say and share when you’ve spent every waking hour of the past week with the same group of people?
Perhaps they’re recollecting how the week began, with us fifty Harvard students speeding through the Chinese wilderness, locked in train cabins playing mafia and poker to pass the hours as we trek from Beijing to Shanghai to Xi’an. We catch first glimpses of the sleepy city of Yan’an, once capitol of the Chinese Communist Party, after traveling hours more in a bus through dusty roads. There, we inhabit a local university hotel with rooms carved into the mountainside, where we stay up bonding with friends on the terrace under a rare sliver of unpolluted night sky, illuminated the unfamiliar presence of constellations. Nights generally pass peacefully, punctuated only when a giant insect invades a room and the entire floor bands together to gallantly save one of our own from the flying assailant.
Some may be trying to recall all the dishes of our extravagant twenty-course meals the government officials insist on presenting us with, where dishes move on and off the Lazy Susan so fast you don’t even have time to try and catch them between your chopsticks. During one particular formal welcome dinner with provincial officials, digital cameras immortalized the looks of pure shock on everyone’s faces when they open their gifts from the Yan’an government to find their doppelganger faces staring up at them, etched with ink onto the side of traditional Chinese waist drums. The next day, we spend two hours in the dry sun, jumping and contorting our bodies in an effort to mimic the movements of the professionals the government sent to teach us how to play those drums.
Others may be trying to relive the morning eager students bombarded us in a junior high school hallway, shoving notebooks and markers in our path, wanting to collect as many autographs from these Harvard foreigners. We emerge from the chaos a little shaken but we strut back on the bus like celebrities. That detour, though, meant that our driver had to speed through narrow unpaved mountain terrain in order to reach our next destination, even though he came harrowingly close to tipping our bus over a cliff and into the rushing Yellow River to do so.
We may also be reliving the experience of visiting the former cave dwellings of Party leaders, including Mao’s, a secular pilgrimage for party fanatics. We were led by a group of elementary school students who insisted on presenting us with several separate renditions of the unofficial communist anthem, “The East is Red”. I enjoy it almost as much as I enjoy listening to my own comrades singing “Tong Hua”, the Chinese equivalent of “Don’t Stop Believing”, in the back of the bus to pass the tedious intermissions made up of traveling between these sites.
Monday morning, back in Beijing, I am once again trapped the three-wall prison cell of my cubicle. However, my monotony is finally interrupted when a slew of emails flood my inbox from friends forged over the course of this trip, and we finally begin our real, organic reflections, no profound questions necessary.

PARIS, France—Returning on a Sunday night from a weekend trip to Switzerland, I got into my apartment building’s tiny, old-fashioned elevator and everything seemed to be going fine. Famous last words.
The elevator stopped with a jolt. There was stillness and silence. I tried to push on the doors, but they would not budge. I was left in a small dark space, with all my baggage and no escape plan.
I pressed all the buttons around me and was suddenly surrounded by weird beeping noises. They wouldn’t stop, but would often change in type and frequency. My dying phone was beeping too, meaning that it still wasn’t completely dead, which gave me a ray of hope. I tried to make a phone call, but there was no reception inside the elevator. I then started shouting “Bon soir? Bon soir?” That didn’t have the desired effect, and I switched to the more expressive “Aide-moi!” (Help me!). How is it possible to be so isolated inside an apartment building full of people?
I removed my black heels from my suitcase and started banging one of them on the elevator door. This seemed like such a “French” solution that for a moment it cheered me up. As my eyes got used to the darkness, I made out a yellow button on the side that had a bell on it. Given the situation, the yellow color felt like an insult. I held one hand on the newly discovered button and banged on the door with a heel with the other, occasionally saying “Aide-moi.” I heard voices below talking to each other, complaining that the elevator doesn’t work, but none of them were talking to me, although, if anything, I should have been complaining with them.
The yellow button started flashing in green, and a whole new set of beeping noises joined the others. I felt like I was in a casino. Or maybe, I thought, the beeps were actually taps which corresponded to the Morse code? As the scenarios were turning in my mind, a prerecorded mechanical-sounding voice made an announcement: “Welcome to the client contact center of the company Kone. Your call will be addressed in a few moments.” I was at least grateful that they didn’t tell me my call was important to them. A few minutes later, a real French voice was angrily trying to shout over all the elevator’s beeping and my shoe’s banging. It was coming from an intercom somewhere inside the elevator, asking me where I was and what was wrong. Then we got cut off. For a while there was more beeping, followed by the same very frustrated, brusque voice. I explained that I had been stuck in an elevator for a very long time.  The voice said it would send someone over, but refused to give me an estimate of when (Ça depend). I started wondering whether I would be rescued before or after my new prison runs out of air.
I couldn’t tell how fast or slowly the time had passed, but while I was dreaming about the ice cream bars in my freezer upstairs, the light suddenly turned on. I heard keys rattling and a voice asking, “Is there anyone in there?” The elevator man had come! Vive la France! When the door opened I was as happy to see him as if he were Prince Charming or a Knight in Shining Armor. I was between floors so I handed him my bags. I then had to climb out, squeeze inside an opening between the elevator and the ceiling and jump on the floor below me. I was free! This must be how the first Bastille Day felt, I thought.
What did I learn from the experience? That even if you are in a foreign country, alone, with no reception, in the dark, stuck in a tiny elevator...eventually, it will be ok. And, by extension, probably so will almost anything else.

Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser has taken a year-long leave of absence after University officials found evidence of scientific misconduct in his laboratory, the Boston Globe reported.
Hauser, the author of “Moral Minds: The Nature of Right and Wrong,” recently retracted an article published in 2002 in the journal Cognition that suggested tamarin monkeys learned rules as human infants did, after an investigation by a Harvard committee concluded that his conclusions were not supported by his data.
Hauser’s lab has been under investigation for the past three years, and Hauser described the inquiry as “painful” in a letter to his colleagues that the Globe obtained.
“An internal examination at Harvard University . . . found that the data do not support the reported findings. We therefore are retracting this article,’’ Hauser and his two co-authors stated in their retraction according to the Globe. The retraction will run in a future issue of Cognition.
Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, declined to comment on Hauser’s departure, stating that ”reviews of faculty conduct are considered confidential.”
“We take our faculty conduct policy seriously,” Neal added in the e-mailed statement. “We have a robust policy and we follow a well defined and extensive review process.”
Several of the students and graduates working in Hauser’s lab declined to comment on the investigation, but expressed respect for Hauser’s dedication to his work.
Hauser has won numerous teaching awards in his tenure at the University and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship—a grant given to artists and scholars who have proven themselves in their field of study—in 2005.
According to the Harvard student course catalog and his office voice mail message, Hauser plans to return to Harvard next fall. He is slated to teach a new class called “Psychology 1066: Origins of Evil” in the spring.
“I am on leave, working furiously on a book, and thus will only be checking e-mail irregularly,” Hauser’s automatic e-mail reply stated.

Adela Penagos, an assistant dean at the University of Notre Dame, has been named the new director of Harvard’s four-year-old Advising Programs Office.
Penagos, who will take the helm Sept. 1, will replace Interim Director Inge-Lise Ameer, who recently announced that she plans to depart for Dartmouth College in the fall.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who chaired the APO director search committee, Penagos’ experience working with a diverse student body—including her previous role as coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs and Services at Notre Dame—will be a strong asset to the APO.
“There are differences in cultural groups as far as help-seeking behavior,” Harris said. "She can really reach into the minority communities better than we have."
Penagos, who was born and raised in Mexico, wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson that her multicultural experiences have assisted her in relating to individuals from “diverse cultural backgrounds.”
“I have been able to work well with all constituencies to date, regardless of a specific cultural background, and hope to continue this trajectory at Harvard,” she wrote.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds—who has repeatedly expressed a commitment to promoting diversity within the College community—echoed Harris’ sentiments in an e-mail announcing Penagos’ appointment to members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, writing that the new director will be tasked with ensuring that the College is “meeting the advising needs of our students from a broad range of backgrounds.”
Penagos’ colleagues at Notre Dame also emphasized her deep commitment to student life.
“If there’s anything that characterizes her for me, it is a real attachment to making sure that students are having a really great experience,” said Ava Preacher, assistant dean of undergraduate studies at Notre Dame. “It has been truly remarkable having her in our office.”
Although new to the College, Penagos spoke highly of her limited experiences at Harvard.
“After interviewing with a number of people during two days, including faculty, staff, and students, I could witness the commitment these individuals have to Harvard and to the advising of highly talented undergraduate students," she wrote. "I wanted to be part of such a wonderful team."

In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten more savvy—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
This week brings us the 2010 Ivy League football media day, where each Ancient Eight coach spent 10 minutes on Tuesday discussing the upcoming season. Here are some highlights from Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s session.
Ah, media day. Ripe with preseason polls, rule changes, and coaches’ insights, this 90-minute event was full of tantalizing sound bytes.  Let’s start with one of the biggest question marks for Harvard this year—the competition at quarterback between a pair of seniors, incumbent starter Collier Winters and LSU transfer Andrew Hatch.
What Murphy said: “I think Collier did a great job last year. He’s a tough kid, very athletic, very committed to football. He’s a good decision maker, and he did a good job taking care of the football…
What we have to find out from Hatch is how is his decision making? Does he do a good job taking care of the football? We kind of hit the tip of the iceberg [with Hatch] in the spring, so we’re going to need to monitor that a lot more in preseason.”
What Murphy means: If nothing else, Winters did exactly what Murphy asked of him last season—take care of the ball. Winters’ touchdown/interception ratio (15:7) was tops in the league last season, and he finished second in total pass yardage (1,861) and third in completion percentage (57.4) en route to second-team All-Ivy honors.
On the other hand, Hatch stands as a much more prototypical quarterback for Murphy’s pro-style offense. At 6’4”, 225 lbs., Hatch has the body type and athleticism to be a standout in the Crimson’s system.
Clearly, the starting nod comes down to Murphy’s emphasis on mistake-free football. Hatch had a tepid showing in Harvard’s spring game in April, completing four passes for 81 yards, and unless the transfer blows coaches away in preseason, Murphy claims to favor Winters as a field general…
What Murphy said: “Right now our team leader and No. 1 QB is Collier Winters. Though there’s going to be competition, we think he’s going to be a little bit better player than he was a year ago, and he was a good player a year ago…But if [Hatch is] the best player, if he’s the guy that can best help us win a championship, then our players are going to support him.”
What Murphy means: To this point, the coach has played the situation perfectly in front of the media. With an incumbent like Winters, who proved himself as the emotional leader of the team last season with a memorable 14-point comeback in The Game, Murphy wants to do everything he can to instill confidence in his starter. Labeling Winters as the presumptive No. 1 should alleviate some of the jitters that hampered him early last season, when doubts abounded as to the signal caller’s ability to take over the starting role.
But by leaving the window open for “the best player who can help win a championship,” Murphy has covered his tracks in case Hatch does catch fire early on. Considering that Harvard had a championship within reach in 2009 before Penn’s defense squashed the Crimson’s hopes, much of the focus will be on which quarterback can deliver in a big-game situation. If Winters can recapture his Yale Bowl magic early in the season, it will bolster his case to keep the starting job, but Hatch’s experience on an SEC team that won the BCS National Championship (though he didn’t start) and his superior talent could prove invaluable during an Ivy title run.
Murphy is not a man accustomed to struggling, and he will not want to lay an egg again against the Quakers. The coach has done all the right things to support Winters, but at the first sign of trouble early on, look for Hatch to get his shot.
Finally, Murphy provided some insight about the offensive line, which must rebuild quickly after graduating four starters, including NFL-caliber left tackle James Williams ’10, who signed a contract with the Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday.
What Murphy said: “I do think we have some ability, we have some chance to be a strong offensive line, but it’s always a concern because it’s a position [where] you need to get some work in. I think one of the surprises of the league will be our left tackle [junior Kevin Murphy]… we think he has a chance to be as good an O-lineman as we’ve had since Matt Birk [’98].”
What Murphy means: Given the Crimson’s track record with offensive linemen—most notably the 13-year NFL standout Birk—Murphy has earned respect as a solid talent evaluator, and Kevin Murphy could be the real deal. Still, the coach’s words of caution speak volumes about the progress that this group needs to make. With four new starters joining senior guard Brent Osborne, pass blocking in particular will take a long time to come together. Until this group really gels, don’t be surprised if opponents see a healthy dose of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales on the ground.

After a year of college, many are ready to go back home and lay around for a bit. Like many of his classmates, Louis Leblanc will be heading home. But as a professional hockey player, he'll be doing anything but lying around.
After being drafted 18th in the 2009 NHL draft by his hometown team, the Montreal Canadiens, Leblanc signed with the Habs in late July after just one year in Cambridge, a year in which he led the team in goals and overall points.
The former freshman phenom is not the only Harvard hockey player turning pro. Leblanc’s former captain, Alex Biega ’10, signed with the Buffalo Sabres on May 26. Beiga was named the team’s MVP as a junior and senior and was twice an all-ECAC selection.
With the graduation of Biega and the early departure of Leblanc, the Crimson loses two of its top players, usually not a good sign for a team hoping to improve upon a 9-21-3 record. But there may be a silver lining for the Harvard skaters. With Biega and Leblanc signing professional contracts and rising sophomore Danny Biega being selected in the third round of the 2010 NHL draft, the Crimson has shown that it can develop athletes into professional material. And while Harvard’s overall record may not turn heads, its string of midseason upsets and ability to develop talent may help it attract top recruits in the future.
Meanwhile, the Crimson now has representatives in all four major professional sports—five if you include soccer. Interestingly, of the four Harvard athletes to be signed this summer fresh out of their Crimson careers—football’s James Williams, men’s basketball’s Jeremy Lin, Alex Biega, and Leblanc—none were drafted in 2010, and only the hockey players were drafted at all. While Cambridge is not exactly a Mecca for future draftees, it seems that aspiring professional athletes at Harvard are just as adept as getting hired as the rest of the student body.
