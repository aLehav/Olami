After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The current economic crisis is forcing both governments and private enterprises to scale back on many projects and expenditures. Spending on scientific research, however, is not a luxury that should be reduced in frugal times. Consequently, it is encouraging that the House of Representatives recently approved billions of dollars in additional funding for scientific research as part of the stimulus package passed by the House.
The fiscal stimulus bill is intended to create new jobs and spur the economy out of the current recession as well as promote long-term growth and development. The combined $6.5 billion of funding for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation that the package contains will be useful in promoting both of those goals.
Because NIH grants not only create jobs for researchers but also frequently result in new products and treatments, funding for the NIH generates more than double its cost in economic output.  This is exactly the sort of intelligent stimulus that Congress should be using to combat the current recession.
And increased funding for scientific research will not only help stimulate the economy but will also create long-term benefits for the country. More widespread availability of grants will encourage students to enter scientific research and help postdocs who need grants to do research and advance in their fields.
Biomedical research is a public good that would not receive enough funding if left to private companies, so government support of such research is essential. In order to continue researching important treatments and keep America on the cutting edge of scientific development, Congress must continue to adequately fund institutions like the NIH and the NSF.
Early in January, Harvard president Drew Faust, along with other members of the Massachusetts Life Science Collaborative, urged Congress to include increased funding for the NIH, the NSF, and other scientific research agencies in the stimulus package. They cited the job growth that additional funding would stimulate as well as the benefits funding for more research would create in the long-term.  Congress’s positive response to this, and other appeals for more funding, is heartening.
The news from Capitol Hill is particularly welcome in Cambridge. Massachusetts, and especially Harvard, received large percentages of the NIH’s allocated funds in earlier years and will likely benefit significantly from this increased funding.  The jobs that new grants will create in Massachusetts and at Harvard will also be beneficial to the state’s economy.
Funding for the NIH and the NSF stagnated during the Bush administration, which, combined with the rising cost of research and inflation, resulted in a decrease in funding from 2003 until now.  We applaud the Obama administration for reversing this disastrous trend and reaffirming the federal government’s support for scientific research.

It goes without saying that, in times like these, the issue of executive compensation is indeed a touchy one. Early this year, the world was shocked to learn that many of Wall Street’s besieged “masters of the universe” had still pocketed vast sums of money in bonuses and salaries—despite the sharp economic downturn that some believe was caused largely by their decisions. Following suit, a group of 10 members of the College’s Class of 1969 have called for drastically lower pay for top executives at the Harvard Management Corporation, who manage the university’s endowment. They have also requested that the managers give back their income earned during the fiscal year ending June 30, when HMC’s top six officials made a collective $26.8 million. Even given the fact that in the following four months, Harvard’s endowment plunged a record 22 percent—losing roughly $8 billion—such calls for drastically lower pay are unreasonable, as they fail to take into account the true impact these officials have on Harvard’s endowment.
The financial industry generally compensates its employees very lucratively, and it is naïve to assume that HMC should behave in any other way. Unless Harvard keeps pace, its top-caliber financial professionals might seek other jobs, leaving positions to be filled by less talented individuals. This same class of alums protested the $107.5 million HMC paid its top officials in 2003. When Harvard proceeded to sharply reduce HMC executive compensation, CEO Jack R. Meyer left the company along with many other successful money managers. It should not be forgotten that, in Meyer’s 15-year tenure as CEO, the endowment grew from $4.8 billion to $25.9 billion. The experts needed to run HMC are entitled to the salaries the financial industry would otherwise afford them; risking their departure in a knee-jerk reaction to the recent economic crisis could—in the future—place Harvard’s endowment in an even worse position than the one it now occupies.
While HMC pays top managers large bonuses, in the long term those officials more than justify their compensations by generating impressive endowment returns. Between 1995 and 2005, for instance, Harvard’s endowment garnered an annualized return of no less than 15.9 percent, which amounts to much more than the sum total of officials’ compensation packages. It is also worthwhile to note that Harvard manages its endowment in-house, so HMC officials appear only on the surface to make much more than money managers at peer institutions. In reality, other schools may pay far more in management fees and expenses, even though they do not directly employ their investors.
While the endowment has fallen recently, so has the rest of the market. The overall performance of Harvard’s endowment is still laudable given the circumstances. In short, mismanagement cannot be blamed as the reason it fell as it did this fall, and HMC officials should be compensated at rates standard in the financial industry.

A basic rule of politics is to avoid offending your allies. Apparently unaware of this tactic, the Czech Republic has decided to celebrate the start of its presidency of the European Union by commissioning a sculpture that is controversial to the point of insult. Entitled “Entropa” and mounted in the foyer of the EU, the eight ton monstrosity takes the form of a model kit, with pieces intended to humorously represent each member country.  The humor lies in the shocking nature of the stereotypes selected—Italy, for example, is depicted as a football pitch, whose players seem to be masturbating with their footballs. 
While the sculpture’s brazen impudence is certainly comic and refreshingly devoid of political correctness, its presence at the center of a major political institution is simply inappropriate. To display an offensive piece like “Entropa” is to dangerously accentuate the political divisions it mocks.
Its subtitle, for instance, is “Stereotypes are Barriers to be Demolished,” a play on the Czech EU presidency motto of “Europe without Barriers.”  In the context of the sculpture’s divisive stereotypes, this transforms the Czech Republic’s noble goal into a foolish ambition to be mocked. The inflammatory images in “Entropa” cast a similarly negative light on other EU goals, such as unity and cooperation. Such “ironic” jibes can only create hostility and division; it is unnecessarily aggravating for such provocative art to decorate a political forum when so many more positive images could have been found.
Indeed, the sculpture has already met with disapproval. Bulgaria’s piece, a series of “Turkish” squat toilets, was hidden by cloth after Bulgaria’s ambassador to the EU protested and sent a note to the Czech government.  Many other nations have been similarly offended by its crude suggestions. Portugal is represented as a cutting board with three pieces of meat in the shape of its former colonies, the UK is absent as a reference to its Euroskepticim, and some claim that Denmark, built of Legos, depicts faces similar to those of the cartoon controversy.   
Aside from its content, debate over the display’s creator also contributes to its inappropriateness. Publicized as the collaborative effort of artists from each EU nation. Czech artist David Cerný recently admitted that he falsified the names of other artists, and that two Czech colleagues were his only assistance.  “Entropa” is thus a symbol of deception and a rejection of international collaboration.
Attempting to explain the rationale behind the sculpture, Cerný explained that, “We wanted  to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself.”  Admittedly, “Entropa” is funny because many of its stereotypes have some element of truth to them. The EU is not as unified as it ideally aspires to be, and of course each of its member countries has flaws. Criticism and humorous mocking by artists can be vital and necessary to help effect change.
Such art, however, belongs outside the political arena. The role of the politician is to attempt to mend divisions and to aim toward uniting people, not to encourage divisive differences. It is dangerous and unhealthy to mock politicians within their working environments, as such jibes only accentuate divisions and hostility. Political institutions thus necessitate a sanctuary of political correctness; choosing a sculpture so contentious is inexplicably antagonistic. One can only hope that all as the Czech government takes the reins of Europe, its future decisions will be more prudent than this one.

Two weeks ago, it was the Flub Heard ’Round The World. Today, President Barack Obama’s forgettable and fumbled exchange with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 has been relegated to a historical footnote and their subsequent reenactment assigned to the annals of White House lore. As a nation, we seem ready to both trivially group Barack Obama with Chester Arthur and Calvin Coolidge—predecessors who gave the oath another go—and direct future visitors to the White House Map Room to admire the fireplace before which history was made. This is political travesty of the first order.
The inauguration of an American president bears all the signs of fine constitutional craftsmanship. As a people, we explicitly mandate that the president-elect assume his or her finely detailed duties at a precise time, on a specific day, and in a prescribed manner. The unambiguous character of our language has always rendered the recurrent execution of these commands—what Ronald Reagan characterized in his 1981 inaugural address as “nothing less than a miracle”—an awe-inspiring spectacle of constitutional clockwork. 
The expectation that events would run like clockwork was disappointed on January 20, casting the tiniest of palls on an extraordinary day certain to join our mystic chords of memory. When the chief justice rendered “faithfully” the successor to the word “president” and not the predecessor of the word “execute,” I felt betrayed of the perfection promised not by the historic character of Barack Obama’s inauguration but by the Constitution itself. Time was hardly “out of joint”—Hamlet’s famed remark, coincidentally, was also associated with taking an oath—but it was momentarily and painfully dislocated. I clenched my teeth and turned to my brother, watching along with me in Quincy House, and winced. It was an inauspicious commencement, to say the least.
Over the next day and a half, I labored—largely successfully—to banish from my mind the image of “faulty mechanics.” This, of course, is both what Obama and Roberts practiced and what they momentarily were. The sight of the President and the chief justice warmly greeting each other at the ensuing Congressional luncheon was comforting but less than redemptive. The first photos of the president conferring with his chief of staff in the Oval Office were more soothing.
Word broke the next evening that the President and Chief Justice had executed, for all intents and purposes, a private do-over at the White House. It took twenty-five seconds and was performed, according to White House counsel Greg Craig, “out of an abundance of caution.”  Strict fidelity was delayed but not denied.
The first online comment I encountered while reading this story was a vain and hate-laced suggestion that President Obama took his second oath with his hand on the Koran, not the Bible. The second comment gushed over Michelle Obama’s frock from the night before. The third attacked the chief justice for not employing a three-by-five card the first time around. Something had stirred within me from the moment I encountered the story on the Drudge Report, but these initial rapid-responders intimated that perhaps the moment was simply insignificant.
Nothing could be further from the truth. For those inclined to interrogate President Obama’s political posture respecting the second oath, nothing embodies repudiation of your predecessor’s constitutional legacy better than honoring the small details. Former President Bush repeatedly abused the large principles, and his successor frequently said so during the presidential campaign. In re-taking the oath, President Obama said so again.
But there is a more transcendent and textually self-reflexive message about American constitutionalism at play here. The linguistic coincidence is delightful, and only with its recognition did my awkwardness about the events of January 20 evaporate for good. The now-infamous verbal cog in the constitutional mechanism—the word “faithfully”—invokes the very quality most on display in the repeat performance at the White House. In other words, Mr. Obama’s very pursuit of strict constitutional fidelity powerfully confirms our new president’s understanding of—and intention to perform—his Constitutional Oath. By saying it again, he only confirmed how deeply he had meant it the first time.

When the buzzer sounded at the end of the Covenant School-Dallas Academy girls’ basketball game on January 13, the score was 100-0. Winning in a close contest is one thing, but this game didn’t even deserve to be called a blowout: it was humiliation, pure and simple. In a country where bad sportsmanship in professional sports is not only prevalent but enjoyed by spectators—see any bench-clearing brawl between the Red Sox and Yankees for proof—the story of this episode of unthinkable athletic proportions swept throughout the country in a matter of days with outrage as opposed to pleasure. Local newspapers, national news networks, and bloggers everywhere were quick to pick up the story, and it even managed to dominate the airwaves of sports-talk radio in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. 
 In the game’s aftermath, many have attempted to blame the winning coach for allowing it to happen, the athletic director and league officers for scheduling these teams to play, and even the parents and fans for egging on the Covenant School players with each successive made basket. While these are of course plausible sources for problems surrounding the game, the single most fundamental part of this game has gone untouched in the blame game: the players. Unless there is a fundamental change in the way our high-school athletes understand and are held accountable for their examples of sportsmanship, incidents like those in Dallas will continue to propagate concern and disgust to the wrong areas.
Understanding the facts at hand is important. The score at halftime was 59-0, and by the end of the third quarter, Covenant was up 88-0. While Covenant Coach Micah Grimes—who was fired the week after the game—was obviously not an example or promoter of healthy competition and good sportsmanship, a man who saw no problem with the “wide” margin of victory, neither he, nor the scheduling of this lopsided match-up, should be seen as the main problem in this event. It was the players of the Covenant girls’ basketball team, not the coach or the league staff, that continued to take three-pointers once the game was clearly out of reach, that continued to steal the ball on defense from an obviously inferior opponent, and that made the basket that marked the 100th point. This simple aspect has yet to be recognized as even apart of the problem.
More disturbing is the extent to which many commentators have gone to excuse the players on the team itself of any blame. Coaches are rarely blamed for a violent or an unnecessary hit in football, or a flagrant or personal foul in basketball or soccer—individual players are rightly penalized. Here, though, an unreasonable blowout has eclipsed the players’ realm and fallen onto the coach. The error with this partitioning of responsibility is seeing athletes as only beings acting physically on their fields and courts, with all of the mental processing being allotted to the coach. Of course, the coach is not on the playing surface and must work by mentally connecting and advising the players, but to think that these athletes have no conscious understanding, or more importantly control, of the sway of a game—especially when it becomes out of hand—is the fallacious thought process that talking heads have made across the country.
Of course, Coach Grimes was not blameless. Nor were the parents and fans, who acted as cheerleaders and affirmers of the lack of sportsmanship. It is all too easy to forget the actual players on the winning team, with normally almost any problem in youth sports being thrown onto the adults involved. While many problems do arise from overzealous coaches and parents who let ideas of grandeur make them ruthless, if we must exculpate the players from this sort of negative event, how can we ever credit them when they perform admirably?  If we are to honor players for their good sportsmanship, we must be willing to cast them in a negative light when they exhibit none.
Even the rules of this high-school basketball league have been called into question, with demands for mercy rules and protocols for when the scoreboard should be turned off. While these may be useful in younger leagues where the youth players are less able to discern and control their style of play, no rule like this is necessary for high-school competition. A level of maturity and sportsmanship has to be required of the players, and not the rulebook. 
Perhaps the most disappointing part of this entire story is that the only reason it was picked up by the media was the roundness of its score. Blowouts occur frequently in all levels of athletics, but it was the two seemingly opposite and gruesomely perfect ends of the score (100-0) that thrust this particular game into the limelight. While the absurdity of the score is substantial, this game, with or without the ink printed about it, is another instance of the absence of sportsmanship. The Covenant School of Dallas has since issued an apology for the game and asked for it to have its own team forfeit the victory to Dallas Academy, but in the end this was never about who won or lost, but how they played the game.

It’s a plot ripped from the pages of a comic book. From former president Larry Summers to Kennedy School professor Samantha Power, many of Harvard’s most famous—and infamous—super-professors are flocking to our nation’s capital to join President Obama’s team. Although the tally of professors departing Harvard to serve in the Obama administration seems to increase every day, the attendant holes in Harvard’s faculty are not cause for major concern.
Harvard will experience numerous benefits when professors take a leave in order to work in D.C. It is important to remember that President Obama’s appointments are inherently political, and thus professors serving his administration are expected to return to Harvard in four—or eight—years, if not sooner. Undoubtedly, these professors will return with new knowledge to impart upon their students, or great experiences to share at the very least. As Harvard attempts to successfully prepare its students for the world outside of academia, professors’ real-life experiences as Washington insiders will provide fodder for their courses when they return. Moreover, though many of the departing professors certainly do not need further validation with regard to their accomplishments, their actions in Washington will add to their prestige and thus benefit Harvard when they return to its faculty.
Neither will Harvard languish at all while the professors are gone. The university has a strict tenure policy that often involves passing over junior professors in favor of more established professors from other universities, effectively driving junior professors away to other institutions after a few years at Harvard. Often, the junior professors who are entirely disregarded by the tenure system are among the best teachers Harvard has to offer. With more esteemed professors out of the limelight, young professors will have increased opportunities to showcase their talent. Allowing qualified junior professors to serve in more prestigious positions due to vacancies of senior faculty will, in the end, benefit students. What’s more, every current star we have has needed to rise through the ranks in one way or another—younger professors now have a chance to shine. With an opportunity to shuffle hierarchy, it might be possible to more fully utilize faculty members.
There is another reason that absent faculty members will benefit Harvard in the short term: As demonstrated in November and again at the presidential inauguration, the media and many people in the United States and abroad are simply crazy for anything Obama-related. Although there are numerous reasons for the 29,000 applications to the Class of 2013, Obama’s connection to Harvard—and the increased prevalence of Harvard affiliates in the news as he selects them for his administration—will certainly contribute to increased interest in the university. The more Harvard professors who take their skills to Washington and create policy there, the more positive publicity Harvard will receive. 
Finally, the newfound decision-making power of Harvard professors gives them an opportunity to benefit Harvard and the causes we further. Professors understand that funding for education and research, for example, is highly important. Having been on the receiving side of the government’s mercy, they will hopefully use their new positions to advocate for policies that will benefit higher education institutions such as Harvard, such as increased funding for scientific research. Just as professors will bring a fresh perspective back to Harvard upon their return, they will also take a Harvard-influenced perspective as they move to Washington.
As important as it is to have bright minds at Harvard, it is equally important for such intelligence to steer our country in a desirable direction. Both Harvard and the nation as a whole should be excited about Harvard professors leaving Cambridge for Washington.

The greatest threat to environmentalists right now may be not insecticides or intransigent oil companies, but indifference. According to a recent Pew Center poll, 15 percent fewer voters deemed “protecting the environment” a top priority than in 2006. Such general apathy frustrates and puzzles adherents of the green movement—all indicators, after all, point to nothing less than impending doom. They thrust forth pamphlets full of statistics (bright red), CO2 graphs (alarmingly inclined), and before-and-after images of Arctic ice caps (now you see ’em, now you don’t).
But this evidence-based approach is only half the solution, for the public will only truly protect the environment if it sees the value of what it is supposed to defend. The language of environmentalism today is often clinical, sterile, and couched in terms of ethical prerogatives against which people either rebel or shoulder with the sense of assuming a heavy burden. Preserving the natural beauty around us, however, should inspire not reluctance, but joy; while retaining the urgency of messages for planetary conservation, we should also impart a sense of the wonders we risk losing. Essential to this approach is a renewed emphasis on nature writing that can bring to bear both the beauty and the transience of our surroundings.
The British writer John Fowles, embracing as he grew older the pleasures of meadow and garden, saw this clearly. “What has to be done,” he said, “is to get this vast and growing army of the indifferent to see nature as a daily pleasure of the civilized life.” He turned his own talents as a writer to this task, allowing his imagination transport back to June evenings spent with “cream-white furbelows, bee-loud and brave against an azure sea of the acacias.”
For the Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran, even the tinest flower embodied the divine being. His moving defenses of river and plain, forest and countryside drew from a deep spiritual connection to nature. “My God-state,” he wrote, “is sustained by the beauty you behold wheresoever you lift your eyes; a beauty which is Nature in all her forms.”
A thousand further examples could be plucked from the annals of history. Nature writing has a long and rich history, extending from the Greek poets; to Wordsworth, Thoreau, and Muir in the 19th century; to the 1970s renaissance of nature-based works like Annie Dillard’s “Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.” Embedded in all this lyricism is an environmental ethics—descriptions of breathtaking beauty move us to realize why nature should not be destroyed and encourage us to industrialize responsibly.
Today, such writing has largely withered on the branch. Certainly, there is no lack of popular nature books on the market, and most of them do their job well enough, alchemizing dense scientific jargon into prose digestible to the lay reader. The majority of today’s writer-activists, however, are in the mold of journalist Michael Pollan, author of “The Omnivore’s Dilemma.” Pollan lays out the case against modern agribusiness in a very persuasive, prescriptive way. But he still argues solely at the level of the intellect, and reason—as any economist or Exxon exec knows—can just as easily be turned to the defense of one’s own interests.
Reading the elegiac prose of one such as Victorian art critic John Ruskin, conversely, does far more to inspire genuine environmentalism than do blind imperatives to recycle. In his memoirs, Ruskin writes of the pristine Alps, meadows, and lilac trees of his childhood, noting that these were eventually paved through by railroads and left “filthy with cigar ashes” by travelers who “knocked the paling about, roared at the cows, and tore down what branches of blossom they could reach.” Nature writing in cases like this is not mere romanticism, for the emotional link it forges props up the reams of statistical evidence produced by science. Nor is it manipulative, for it encourages our noblest impulses (as appeals to marching penguins and Al Gore don’t, really).
Composed of equal parts science and ethics, the environmental movement must engage in a delicate balancing act. It has succeeded through graphs and PowerPoints in persuading us of the “inconvenient truth” and the duties it entails; our heads are now engaged, but not our hearts. Perhaps the wisest words come from Emerson, whose advice for the lovers of leaf and blossom in his own generation applies equally well for today’s environmentalists: “Things added to things, as statistics, civil history, are inventories. Things used as language are inexhaustibly attractive.”Jessica A. Sequeira ’11, a Crimson associate editorial editor, is a social studies concentrator in Winthrop House.

In Frank Capra’s 1939 classic, “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” a hapless governor upends his state’s political machine by appointing Jefferson Smith, the naive, all-American head of the Boy Rangers, to a vacancy in the United States Senate. Smith, played by Jimmy Stewart, wins the admiration of his colleagues when he successfully refutes false corruption charges against him through an impassioned filibuster. 
Regrettably, a similar Hollywood ending to the recent Senate appointment saga proved elusive. Following Election Day, President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all resigned their Senate seats. Nepotism, political power plays, and outright corruption sullied the search for their replacements. This should come as no surprise, since gubernatorial appointments to Senate seats are fundamentally undemocratic. They reward famous names, connections, and fundraising ability while denying the citizens of a state the chance to decide who their senator will be. Instead of relying on this outdated process for selecting interim senators, special elections should be held in the case of an unexpected death or resignation.
Governors often appoint members of political dynasties to Senate vacancies because of their name recognition and fundraising connections. This makes it easier for the newly minted senator to win a full term and puts the weight of an influential family behind the governor’s own reelection efforts. This consideration caused Governor David Paterson to initially favor Caroline Kennedy ’79 for New York’s open seat. Though Kennedy was widely panned for her inexperience and poor performance in press conferences, Paterson stood by the former first daughter, hoping to gain the Kennedy family’s support for his 2010 reelection bid. 
In most states, the governor is allowed to appoint a new senator who does not belong to the same party as the senator leaving office. But an unexpected vacancy should not be an opportunity for a governor to change the Senate’s balance of power through a partisan political ploy. Though this situation has not arisen in recent years, it nearly occurred in 2006, when Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) suffered a major stroke. Had Sen. Johnson died, Mike Rounds, the Republican governor of South Dakota, would have appointed a Republican to the vacant seat, thereby delivering the majority in the Senate back to the GOP. 
Worst of all, political appointments present a tempting opportunity for quid pro quo backroom deals, as demonstrated by Governor Rod Blagojevich’s attempted sale of Illinois’s open Senate seat. Though most governors would never engage in such brazen corruption, it takes just one light-fingered public official to tarnish the democratic process. Furthermore, even honest governors expect some sort of goodie in return for choosing a candidate, be it political support or fundraising help. As Governor Blagojevich crudely put it, “a Senate seat is a [expletive] valuable thing, you don’t just give it away for nothing.”  Governor Paterson took this lesson to heart; his eventual choice of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was designed to shore up his support from upstate New York voters as the 2010 gubernatorial election approaches.  
All of these serious conflicts of interest could be avoided if vacant Senate seats were filled through special elections. Upon a senator’s death or resignation, the governor would set a date for the election of the senator’s replacement. The election would be held within three months of the vacancy, and the winner would fill the Senate seat until the next regularly scheduled election. Special elections are used to fill open seats in the House of Representatives and many offices at the statewide level. They are practical and feasible, and would give a state’s electorate the power to make an interim appointment by itself. 
Fortunately, Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) has recognized the wisdom of such a change. This week, he will introduce a constitutional amendment that would end gubernatorial appointments of interim senators, instead mandating the replacement of senators through special elections. Given the public outcry surrounding the Senate appointments in New York and Illinois, Sen. Feingold’s amendment has a reasonable chance of passing. It would fulfill the legacy of the 17th Amendment, which instituted the direct election of senators in 1913. Like its century-old forebearer, the proposed amendment furthers the voters’ ability to choose their leaders.
If “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” had been a true story, then Mr. Smith would never have gone to Washington at all. Instead, his state’s governor would probably have selected someone with strong ties to the local political machine, a Rolodex full of influential allies and wealthy donors, and a famous name. If the 28th Amendment is ratified, the public might indeed choose the career politician over the Mr. Smiths of the world to fill Senate vacancies. But, in this case, what matters is that the choice was made by the voters, not by an electorate of one.

The Eli and Edythe Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard laid off 24 of its MIT employees who handled genetic sequencing last Tuesday citing advances in genetic sequencing technology that have made those jobs obsolete.
The Institute, which was founded through a joint venture of the two institutions in June 2003, announced in a press release that “this move is unrelated to the recent widespread economic problems.” Eli and Edythe Broad recently donated $400 million to the Institute in September 2008. 
“Absolutely no lay-offs will take place in the HMS Genetics Dept. as a result of technological advances,” wrote Cliff Tabin, chairman of the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, in an e-mail statement. “Indeed new technology will probably mean we need to hire new people to run advanced machines in our cores over time. However we are set up far differently from the Broad.”
Harvard’s genetic sequencing researchers currently hold positions at the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and the Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases at the School of Public Health. 
Harvard administrators said that the Broad Institute incident is an isolated one, and that advances in genetic sequencing technology will probably not have ripple effects on Harvard employees.
According to the press release, “The rapid evolution of DNA sequencing technologies has required the Broad Institute to transition its genome sequencing efforts from performing high-throughput work on the traditional technologies to actively developing and optimizing the use of next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies.” 
“Since the Broad’s Genome Sequencing Platform originated largely from the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research, the group consists primarily of MIT employees,” said Nicole M. Davis, the institute’s scientific communications specialist. 
Dr. Robert Kingston, vice chairman of the Department of Molecular Biology at Harvard Medical School agreed that the layoffs are unique to the Broad. 
“There is no technology that I am aware of that has gone through more dramatic changes in technology than DNA sequencing and no one associated with Harvard [as Broad is] has done [anywhere] near the volume [of] sequencing as the Broad,” said Kingston in an e-mail. “So this is more a reflection of this technology and the special situation of the Broad.”

While many Harvard students spent intersession recovering from a stressful exam period, seven volunteers from Harvard College Engineers Without Borders were busy drilling wells in the Dominican Republic.
“We were in the middle of a broccoli field covered in mud,” said Alison M. Forsyth, a research assistant in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a co-chair of the project.
The trip was the culmination of years of planning and two preliminary trips to the region that began in fall of 2007.
During their eight-day project in the semi-mountainous, rural town of Constanza, the students successfully drilled one well to provide clean water for a single Dominican family and began work on a second, which is expected to be completed by community members in Constanza after the group’s departure.
While the Dominican Republic has one of the fastest growing economies in the Caribbean and South America, the United States Agency for International Development reports that approximately 43 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
In Nov. 2007, the nascent student group, headed by founder Jacqueline E. Stenson ’08, led a preliminary expedition to the Dominican Republic to assess the public health situation in the region.
But when the group took a second trip to the area in May 2008, their attempt to build a well was unsuccessful. 
Lazarus said that this year’s trip was a big step forward for the organization.
The young engineers constructed their own drilling rig with materials from a local hardware shop in Constanza. They used a novel drilling technique developed by Terry Waller, a missionary working with Water For All International, a non-governmental organization based in Texas.
According to Forsyth, the students hope to return to the area to build more wells with the help of local community members.
“We are empowering individual families to learn how to drill their own wells, as opposed to going into a region and giving someone who is poor something they don’t know how to maintain and improve,” Forsyth said.
According to Baltazar A. Zavala ’11, who was the only Spanish-speaking member of the trip, collaboration with the community was one of the most rewarding aspects of the project.
“It wasn’t just us solving the problem for them,” he said. “It was us working together with them to solve the problems.”

The Cambridge City Council voted last night to oppose the use of Homeland Security surveillance cameras in eight locations in the city, citing concerns about the preservations of civil liberties.The cameras, which were installed last year but have yet to be activated, were funded by a federal Homeland Security grant program. The cameras were intended to monitor traffic during emergency evacuations, according to City Councillor Craig A. Kelley.But during the public comment segment of the meeting, citizens suggested that the potential civil liberties threats posed by the cameras outweighed any potential benefits.“They are the local manifestation of the closing down of our privacy,” said  Nancy Ryan, former president of the Mass. American Civil Liberties Union. Ryan was one of several ACLU associates who spoke at the meeting, which drew a crowd that filled the room and overflowed into the hallway.Other residents brought up the possibility that the cameras might have a detrimental effect on residents’ first amendment rights. Approximately 180 cameras have been installed in the Boston metropolitan area, according to Donald E. McGough, director of the Boston Office of Emergency Preparedness. As of last month, McGough stated that $4.6 million had been invested since 2004 to install the network of cameras in the area. Although the program gives municipality police commissioners control of the cameras in their district, towns can grant the Boston Office of Emergency Preparedness access to the footage.Many residents said they were concerned about how the recordings would be used—and by whom.“The reality is that we cannot control what the federal government will do with this information down the road,” resident Gail Epstein said at the meeting.At last night’s meeting, Councillor Marjorie C. Decker emphasized that the cameras were installed by a private company hired by the Boston Office,  without the involvement of the Cambridge City Council.It remains unclear what effect the council’s resolution will have on the surveillance initiative. In Brookline, a town that also falls under the program, local officials voted to proceed with the program on a trial basis, according to Nancy Daly, chairwoman of the Brookline Selectmen. “I would imagine we can stop it...It’s a matter of the Brookline police department voluntarily going along with it,” Daly said in a phone interview with The Crimson.Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that the Council should have been more vigilant in monitoring Homeland Security efforts in the city.Kelley said that “we the council should have known to press more aggressively” when asking the City Manager about Homeland Security funding.   However, not all councillors backed the resolution. Councillor Tim Toomey said that he did not think there had been enough public participation in the night’s decision-making process. “Stores, banks, residents all have cameras. I don’t see anybody raising concerns about those cameras,” Toomey said.—Staff writer Danella H. Debel can be reached at debel@fas.harvard.edu.         —Staff writer Sarah J.

In an unanimous vote, the City of Boston gave Boston College the green light to proceed with its $1.6 billion campus expansion in Brighton, but deferred decision-making on a controversial dormitory that BC proposed to build on property purchased from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.
The Institutional Master Plan for BC’s ten-year expansion—approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority at a meeting last Thursday evening—currently proposes athletic facilities as well as dormitory space for about 800 students. 
The 150-bed dormitory that remains in question has recently been approved by the Allston Brighton BC Community Task Force, but still faces strong opposition from Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, as well as some local residents.
Jessica Shumaker, a spokeswoman for the BRA, said that “after hearing the testimony of both sides, [the BRA] just thought it would be best to further study the location of the 150 beds.” 
She added that although BC’s master plan had been approved, the university cannot break ground on individual construction projects without approval by the Zoning Commission.
BC officials had hoped that the Brighton expansion would allow BC to become the first major college in the city of Boston to house all undergraduates on campus, a move that they say will reduce neighborhood complaints of disruptive student behavior. 
Currently, BC offers on-campus housing for roughly 85 percent of its student body.
The expansion plans, filed in June 2008, have encountered significant resistance from some Brighton community members, who say that they are wary of universities such as BC and Harvard encroaching on their neighborhoods. 
While Harvard has attached a $25 million community benefits package to its planned four-building science complex in Allston, BC currently has no comparable fund for the community outlined in its plans. 
Long-time Brighton resident Theresa Hynes—who is also a founding member of Brighton Neighbors United, a community organization dedicated to “preserving the residential character of Brighton”—said she would prefer that BC utilized its existing property holdings more efficiently. 
“I feel there is enough space on campus to house [all the students],” Hynes said. “All that is necessary is to increase the height [of dorms] and have some moderate high rises on campus.”
She added that college students tend to be “boisterous” by nature and keep late hours, which she said she feared would be “disruptive for the neighborhood.”
But Denis Minihane, a Brighton resident and a member of the BC Task Force, said that a dormitory expansion would bring economic benefits and “young, inquisitive minds” to Brighton. He added that concerns about neighborhood disruptions were overblown, and that “some of the most vocal [opponents of BC’s expansion plans] don’t even live close to the neighborhood.” 
Minihane said he predicted that Menino would eventually give his complete support to the Brighton dormitory plans. 
“The Mayor will review it and come out at a quiet date and approve the dorms,” Minihane said. “That’s my feeling.”

Harvard announced last week that it would receive $10 million to support research and technology development in the life sciences from a foundation headed by a Harvard Business School alum.
The Blavatnik Family Foundation, run by billionaire Business School graduate Leonard Blavatnik, designated $5 million of the gift to fund the Harvard University Technology Development Accelerator Fund, 
This fund supports budding research on promising technologies.  
The other half of the donation will support the work of Harvard Medical School assistant professors Catherine J. Wu and Nir Hacohen at the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute, where the two research cancer vaccines.
Wu’s research, which focuses on leukemia, studies how the human immune system responds to signals presented by leukemia cells, while minimizing potentially harmful side-effects, she said. 
The donation will provide support for her efforts to identify new classes of immunogens, signals that allow the immune system to recognize foreign matter in the body, Wu said. More immunogens could allow scientists to more specifically target leukemia.
Hacohen’s research focuses on determining how immune responses are triggered under different conditions, including infections and for autoimmune reactions, such as organ transplant rejection or rheumatoid arthritis.
“This collaboration with Dr. Wu combines some of my lab’s approaches with Dr. Wu’s lab’s scientific and clinical goals,” Hacohen said. “Together, we are trying to understand how to induce effective immunity against tumors.”
The other $5 million will support life sciences projects funded by the Accelerator Fund, which aims to speed scientific discoveries from the lab to the marketplace. 
The Accelerator Fund, managed by Harvard’s Office of Technology Development, provides money to move research on technologies with promising market and scientific value from early stages to the point where they can be invested in by pharmaceutical companies or industry.
“There is a funding gap at this point—researchers might discover what appears to be a really useful molecule, but it needs more work before getting to the point where a company would be ready to make an investment in it,” said Harvard science spokesman B. D. Colen. “What the accelerator fund is meant to do is to bridge that gap.”

Harvard Kennedy School Professor Samantha Power has been tapped for a senior foreign policy position on the National Security Council.
Power—who won a Pulitzer Prize for her book on human rights—will join a slew of Harvard professors moving to Washington to join the Obama administration, including many of her colleagues at the Kennedy School and her husband, Cass R. Sunstein ’75, a professor at Harvard Law School.
While the details about Power’s role remain unclear at this point, she will be required to work closely with Secretary of State Clinton as the senior director for multilateral affairs at the NSC, according to the Associated Press. 
In March 2008, Power gained notoriety during the presidential campaign for calling Hillary Clinton a “monster.” She resigned as an adviser to the Obama campaign soon after.
Her gesture to apologize to Clinton was reportedly well-received, and Power was brought back into the fold to review both the State Department and the U.S. mission to the United Nations for the presidential transition.
Power’s colleagues at HKS lauded her appointment, citing her foreign policy and academic credentials as key reasons she will be able to make a lasting contribution in the administration. 
Former Dean of the Kennedy School Joseph S. Nye—who has been offered the position of U.S. ambassador to Japan—recalled that Power played an instrumental role in building the school’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, which she founded in 1999. 
“She was energetic, intelligent, and a great success,” Nye wrote in an e-mailed statement. “She is a remarkably talented person, and I am sure she will make a major contribution on the NSC.”
Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison Jr.—who met Power when she was a third-year student at Harvard Law School and later co-edited a book on human rights with her—said that Power’s academic work may provide the best clues for how she will shape foreign policy in her new role on the NSC. 
“A Problem from Hell,” her Pulitzer Prize winning book in 2003, explores the nation’s response to genocides in Cambodia, Iraq, and Rwanda among others, throughout the twentieth century. 
Kennedy School Professor Jeffrey A. Frankel points to her “passionate” efforts in bringing the issues raised by the Rwandan genocide, for example, to national attention.
“People speculate as to why Bill Clinton did not intervene to try to stop the Rwandan genocide,” said Frankel, who served on the Council of Economic Advisors under Clinton. 
“They probably don’t realize that there was never even a meeting in the White House at which such an action would have been considered,” he added. 
Frankel said that if another similar event were to take place, Power, in her role on the NSC, would “bring it forcefully to President Obama’s attention.”

University President Drew G. Faust addressed a crowd of inquisitive students at last night’s Undergraduate Council meeting, fielding questions on subjects ranging from the University’s response to the current financial crisis to the Reserve Officer Training Corps’ absence from campus. 
“I thought she was really open with the students,” said Andrea R. Flores ’10, who officially assumed the position of UC president at yesterday’s meeting.
In her initial remarks, Faust discussed Harvard’s future, citing her optimism about recently inaugurated president Barack Obama as well as the sobering reality of the global economic downturn.
Faust spoke warmly of the sense of “hope” surrounding Obama, describing it as a “kind of contagion” and stating that his leadership would inspire the University to better career counseling for those wishing to pursue public service. 
“A whole array of Harvard alums and faculty are working in Washington right now to use their knowledge garnered at Harvard to make a difference,” Faust said, noting the University’s involvement with the new administration.
Turning her attention to a recent financial crisis that has brought unprecedented losses to Harvard’s endowment, Faust affirmed the University’s commitment to its financial aid program—a pledge that she has made on multiple occasions in the past few months. 
When two students raised concerns about possible lay-offs of Harvard employees, Faust—who wrote in a November letter to the University that “changing financial realities will require us to look carefully at compensation costs”—emphasized that 50 percent of Harvard’s budget goes to cover payroll costs.
“We are trying to figure out all the ways we can adjust to our current economic climate,” she said. “Scrutiny of our budget and how we spend money is imperative.”
One freshman representative questioned Faust about future changes in Harvard’s ROTC policy in light of Obama’s stance against the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy that currently bars openly gay individuals from serving in the armed forces. Harvard currently does not allow its ROTC students to conduct training exercises on campus.
“To get official recognition, a group cannot have any exclusionary rules,” Faust said, indicating that Harvard’s policy would remain. “I look forward to the day when we can change our position on ROTC on campus,” she said.
The implementation of a recent report of the Faust-chartered University-wide Task Force on the Arts was also discussed in light of the current financial crisis. Faust indicated that only certain parts of the report would go forward at present.
Following Faust’s remarks, Flores and Kia J. McLeod ’10, incoming vice president, recited an oath of office as they assumed leadership of the UC. Outgoing president Matthew L. Sundquist ’09 passed along a gavel to Flores, which she used to call the first meeting of her presidency to order. 
Although Flores and McLeod now assume official responsibility for the UC, Sundquist and Randall S. Sarafa ’09 will still have a presence on the Council, presenting a soon-to-be released report evaluating the UC’s effectiveness. Sundquist will continue to sit on a committee addressing Ad Board reform.
“I don’t think I’ll ride off into the sunset just yet,” he said.

The approval of four more classes for General Education credit brings the total number of approved courses to 70 across the new curriculum’s eight categories.All four courses have been adapted from the current Core Curriculum and each will satisfy a different Gen Ed category. 
Until this point, most approved classes were in humanities-based fields. Three of the courses approved by the Gen Ed committee last Thursday, however, will fulfill math or science requirements.  
“Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning,” the “Science of Living Systems,” and “Science of the Physical Universe” will see increased course variety. All three categories had previously comprised fewer than seven course selections each.
Two courses offered this past fall term, Quantitative Reasoning 50: “Medical Detectives” and Science B-60: “Origins of Knowledge,” will fulfill the “Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning” and “Science of Living Systems” requirements, respectively.
Science A-45: “Reality Physics,” last offered four years ago, will be offered in Spring 2010 and will meet the Gen Ed requirement for “Science of the Physical Universe.” 
According to Physics Professor Gerald Gabrielse, who will teach the course, the class was deemed a model Gen Ed course during the course of the curricular review. 
History of Art and Architecture Professor Thomas B. F. Cummins’ course Foreign Cultures 93: “Pathways through the Andes—History, Culture, and Politics in Andean South America,” offered this term, can be taken to meet the requirement for either “Culture and Belief” or “Societies of the World.”
At present, “United States in the World” and “Ethical Reasoning” boast the fewest offerings, with five and four classes approved, respectively.

In difficult circumstances, a team must always be able to turn to its captains for inspiration. 
Fortunately for Harvard (10-7-3, 10-4-2 ECAC), it can rely on the leadership qualities of a protagonist determined to make up for lost time.
Senior forward and tri-captain Jenny Brine, rejuvenated upon her return to the lineup following a thumb injury last November, produced a virtuoso display as the Crimson secured back-to-back five-goal performances against Union and Rensselaer to extend its winning streak to four games.
Having had almost three weeks without a game due to final exams, the Harvard tri-captain was simply pleased to relieve the tension and get back on the ice.
“It was great after a long period off due to the exam period to get our legs back underneath us,” Brine said. “We had two strong performances and two wins, so it’s just nice to start rolling again.”
Crimson coach Katey Stone also expressed her delight with the returning forward’s form at such an important stage in the season.
“It’s great to have her back in the lineup after her injury. She’s one of our most talented players,” Stone said. “It’s good to see her feeling well and being able to shoot the puck so soon after coming back from injury.”
In a challenging weekend, Brine’s contribution was decisive. 
Against Union, in the absence of fellow tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, Brine broke the ice and settled Harvard’s nerves by scoring the opening goal early in the second period. 
The Crimson’s torch lit, Brine continued to prove the scourge of the Dutchwomen with a further three assists in a 5-1 rout. Contributing to junior Cori Bassett’s power-play goal and setting up both of sophomore Katharine Chute’s goals, Brine believed that the link-up with the forwards was key to Harvard’s success.
“It was good to get some chemistry this weekend [with Chute],” Brine said.
Against Rensselaer, Brine recorded two assists, feeding the restored Vaillancourt twice in a 5-4 win. The tri-captains combined incisively to build a strong advantage and continue the winning momentum.
As her injury rehabilitation continues, the senior is relishing this season’s new-found leadership responsibilities and this weekend’s dominant display serves as evidence. “This season’s been a tough one for me,” Brine said. “As a captain, I think things are going well. It’s fun being a senior, and I’ve enjoyed being captain.”
In a campaign hampered by injury, Brine’s return is timely for Harvard. With the Beanpot, Ivy League, and ECAC Championships on the horizon, Stone will count on her tri-captain to be part of the Crimson’s offensive triumvirate.
“She’s a great kid, and I think she leads by example first,” Stone said. “It was a setback for her and for the team when she was out of the lineup, just because she plays hard, leads, and follows by example. It’s nice to have her back.”
With so much to play for, Brine is determined to secure a complete reversal of her injury problems by leading Harvard to future success.
“We’re just heading into this final stretch shooting for a good deal,” Brine said. “Everything is still open for us to achieve, and all of us have really high expectations for this part of the season.”

The Harvard women’s hockey team spends its entire season fighting—for league supremacy, home ice in the ECAC playoffs, and a trip to the NCAA tournament.
But for two Tuesdays in February, the Crimson gets a chance to compete for a different kind of title.
Tonight, Harvard (10-7-3, 10-4-2 ECAC) and Boston University (13-9-5, 7-6-3-3 Hockey East) will face off in the opening round of the 31st Beanpot to find out who plays the best hockey in Beantown. The puck drops at 5 p.m. at Northeastern’s Matthews Arena.
“There’s a little different preparation in that there’s more history to this tournament,” sophomore forward Kate Buesser said. “There’s a lot of bragging rights involved. It’s a really exciting tournament in that and because we get to play teams that aren’t in our conference, to see more of the league.”
Last year, Harvard breezed through the tournament as part of a 21-game win streak, taking the crown for the first time since 2005.
The Crimson claimed the title with a 3-1 victory over the Terriers in the finals.
But don’t expect a repeat to be easy. While the Beanpot often brings out the best in the participating teams, the competition this year is stronger than ever.
Harvard, BU and BC have all spent time in the national rankings this season, with the Eagles currently sitting at No. 7. After falling out of the polls in December, the Crimson is back in the receiving-votes category this week.
Though Northeastern has fallen below the .500 mark, the team got off to a hot 5-0-2 start and holds home-ice advantage throughout the tournament.
“Any time you know that a team has been ranked, it gives you a little bit more incentive to go out there, really play well, and see what our team can do,” Buesser said. 
The Crimson comes into the game riding a four-game win streak, its longest of the season. After struggling to find its offensive groove early in the season, Harvard has broken out with 16 goals in the last four games. 
“I think we want to take the momentum that we’ve gained from this weekend and head into the game with confidence,” tri-captain Jenny Brine said. “We know as a team that we can take on any opponent.”
Tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt leads the offense with 23 points, while Brine and senior Sarah Wilson, the reigning Beanpot MVP, are right behind with 17 points apiece. Brine has been hot as of late, coming off a six-point weekend in wins over RPI and Union.
On the defensive end, the Crimson is bolstered by the return of junior Cori Bassett, who was on the ice this weekend for the first time in over a month. Bassett had a goal and an assist in last weekend’s sweep.
The Terriers are also fresh off a weekend sweep, taking two games from Hockey East rival Vermont at home.
Junior Melissa Anderson leads BU with 23 points, while Terrier co-captain Gina Kearns sets the pace with 12 goals, including a last-minute game-winner on Friday.
Senior Allyse Wilcox has seen the majority of time in net, posting a 2.28 goals-against average. 
BU’s impressive season resumé already includes wins over Mercyhurst, New Hampshire, and BC, all of whom are currently ranked in the top 10 nationally.
The Terriers will come into the game hungry, as they have endured the longest title drought of any of the four participating teams.
The team’s only tournament win came in 1981.
History favors Harvard in this matchup, though, as the Crimson has won 19 straight meetings with BU and holds a 13-1 record against the Terriers in the Beanpot.
“[BU is] a very good team,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.
“It’s the Beanpot, so there’s a lot of added incentive, and we’d certainly like to keep it in Cambridge.”
The Crimson will also face the challenge of playing three games a week for the next three weeks, a pace that could exhaust any team.
But with Boston bragging rights on the line, there’s no doubt that Harvard will come out tonight ready to play.
“It’s definitely going to be a challenge,” Buesser said.“It can take a lot out of you, but we’re going to be really smart about recovery and taking care of our bodies. You play the sport for these games, so hopefully we can keep playing our best.”

BOSTON—If only. Although the Harvard men’s hockey team ultimately fell to No. 1 Boston University 4-3, the Crimson held its own against the top-ranked team in the nation and nearly secured a victory, as junior Alex Biega slammed in what would have been the tying goal just milliseconds after time ran out on the first round of the Beanpot tournament last night. “The game was pretty even throughout,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “But we put them on the power play, and they’re tough to stop.” While the Crimson managed to remain competitive, the Terriers, which have converted 23.8 percent of power plays and are 89 percent on the penalty kill, came through on special teams to secure the win.“Our power play won it for us,” BU coach Jack Parker said.Harvard gave the Terriers three man-advantage opportunities in the first period, but the Crimson killed each chance, with freshman Colin Moore and co-captain Brian McCafferty clearing the puck out of the defensive zone to limit BU’s persistent offensive threat.On top of that, the Terrier offense had trouble getting the puck on frame, with only seven of 22 attempts making it on target.But when the Crimson gave the opponent man-advantages in the remaining periods, BU proved its power-play mettle and broke through Harvard’s defense to score a pair of momentum-shifting goals.Terrier Nick Bonino knocked in the tying goal during a second-period power play. The game-winner was scored on a BU man-advantage created by a Crimson penalty with just over two minutes remaining in the game. Less than 20 seconds into the power play, Terrier Jason Lawrence slammed in the deciding goal to advance his team to the championship round.“This is a team that can really hurt you on the power play in a lot of ways,” Donato said. “We did a decent job killing penalties for most of the night, but when you give them opportunities in the 6, 7 range, they’re going to score a couple goals on most teams.”YOUTH CULTUREIt is a truth universally acknowledged that the Beanpot is a tournament in which seniors really come out to play.So it’s somewhat surprising to learn that some of Harvard’s biggest plays at last night’s event were made by underclassmen. Sophomores Michael Biega and Pier-Olivier Michaud slapped in two of the Crimson’s goals, while freshman Alex Killorn tallied an assist on the first score of the night. Killorn scored an unassisted power-play goal of his own one minute into the second period, firing a shot from the left side that slipped into the right pocket of the net past BU goalie Millan Kieran, who is also a freshman.Perhaps one of the most notable performances of the night came from freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle, who made 30 saves and allowed four goals, two of which were results of power plays. And although Hoyle took a period to get into a good rhythm, the rookie made a few crucial saves later in the night that kept the Crimson neck-and-neck with the Terriers. Hoyle jumped on the puck to save a long shot from a BU defenseman to keep the score tied at the end of the second period. Halfway through the final frame, Hoyle dove to block the puck with his glove, and then made another glove stop seconds later on a similar attempt from the Terriers.“It’s difficult for anybody to play their first Beanpot game,” Donato said. “There were times where Matt was excellent during the game…and there were times when he wasn’t at his best. That’s part and parcel of having a young goalie, but ultimately, I think he gave us a chance to win.”—Staff writer Courney D. Skinner can be reached at cskinner@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It would have been an upset for the ages, perhaps even more stunning than the men’s basketball team’s defeat of then-No. 17 Boston College one month ago. But time ran out before the Crimson could conjure up one last miracle, as the Harvard men’s hockey team fell 4-3 to No. 1 Boston University (20-5-1) last night in the first round of the annual Beanpot tournament. In front of 17,565 fans on the biggest stage of Boston area hockey, the Crimson (5-12-4) made a strong showing against its top-ranked foes, but junior Alex Biega’s would-be tying goal found the net a split-second after the clock expired in the third period.“I thought it was a great hockey game,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “I’m very proud of our guy. We battled not only to the last second, maybe to the last extra half-second.”The contest’s dramatic ending brought the climax of a frame marked by high tensions, as the squads entered the final period knotted at 2-2. Allowing its opponent no early shots on goal, Harvard had the first opportunity to break the tie when sophomore Michael Biega found some separation and blasted a shot off the crossbar nine minutes in.The squandered chance proved costly a few minutes later. Immediately after winning the faceoff, BU’s Zach Cohen pushed the puck past Crimson freshman goalie Matt Hoyle to give the Terriers their first lead of the game at 11:25.Cheered on not only by its small student section but also by Northeastern supporters, Harvard refused to give in and responded just three minutes later. On the fifth and final power play for the Crimson, Biega wristed a hard shot on goal from between the faceoff circles, and sophomore Pier-Olivier Michaud’s deflection dribbled between the BU netminder’s legs to tie it at three all.A Harvard hooking penalty with just over two minutes to go gave the formidable Terrier power play a chance to flex its muscles. Taking advantage of the penalty, Terrier Jason Lawrence found space in the left faceoff circle and unleashed a devastating slap shot over Hoyle’s left shoulder, sending the BU fans into a frenzy.Despite pulling its goalie with a minute left, the Crimson could not muster an equalizer to send the game into overtime. Amidst the confusion after Biega’s desperation attempt, the final ruling from a video-replay review declared that the puck went in after time had expired. The Terriers escaped with the win over the underdog, but not without a few scratches.“That’s why the Beanpot’s so special,” Biega said. “You’re guaranteed to get a great game. It was close, it was tough, but I think our team really battled through it, and we took a step forward, that’s for sure.”Aggressive from the start, Harvard certainly showed no signs of being intimidated by BU’s ranking. Crimson freshman Alex Killorn opened the first period with a solid chance to score, and later two saves by Hoyle helped kill the first Terrier power play. Having neutralized its opponent’s attack, Harvard made the most of its own scoring opportunity 11 minutes into the frame, when a soft wrister through the five-hole from sophomore Michael Biega gave him his fourth goal of the season. The younger Biega took a pass from freshman Eric Kroshus in the left circle and maneuvered his way through the defense to put the Crimson ahead.Lackluster play by BU combined with Hoyle’s solid performance in goal kept the Terriers scoreless for the rest of the period, despite two more power plays. The Harvard netminder seemed unaffected by the pressure of his first Beanpot appearance, stopping a flurry of shots in a dangerous sequence right before the first intermission.Also crucial were the two BU penalties committed during the last 12 seconds of the frame, which set up the Crimson’s 5-on-3 man advantage to start the second period. Barely a minute into the power play, Killorn came through with an unassisted shot over the Terrier goalie’s right shoulder, opening up a commanding two-goal Harvard lead. But BU responded in impressive fashion, as forward Nick Bonino erased the deficit with a pair of goals 1:43 apart, the first a one-timer from the left side off a pass out of the corner. After a subsequent Crimson hooking penalty, Bonino took a backside pass from captain Matt Gilroy and scooped a backhand past Hoyle.The next Terrier power play was successfully killed thanks in part to a sprawling save by Hoyle, and neither team found another opening the rest of the period to set up the memorable finish.After having outshot BU 9-7 in the first period, Harvard managed only seven shots to the Terriers’ 17 in the second.—Staff writer Dennis J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Nov. 22, something has been missing in my life.
After two glorious months, my weekly ritual of abusing my column-writing privileges by ripping Dartmouth’s football team for its self-loathing, doormat style of play came to a close on that date. With the end of the Ivy League season, I was left with no contemptible Ancient Eight athletic program to unleash my misguided fury and disgust upon.
That was until I found the Princeton men’s basketball team.
As I walked into Lavietes Pavillion on Saturday night to watch what would be a painful 77-71 Harvard loss, I was immediately thrown off balance by the rancid, unmistakable stench of douchebaggery. Nauseous, yet unable to stop sniffing the air for the source of this foul odor, my attention turned to the court. It was then that I identified the culprits as none other than the Tigers hoopsters.
In a Dec. 26 mailbag, ESPN.com columnist Bill Simmons wrote, “I’m still waiting to meet my first Princeton grad that I might like. I am like 0-for-79. Princeton grads carry themselves like bad guys in a sports movie.”
If Princeton’s basketball squad is any reflection of the school’s student body and alumni, the Sports Guy might be on to something.
From the early stages of the game it was obvious that the Tigers were not a very likeable collection of athletes. When I arrived about five or six minutes into the first half, the Crimson faithful was already booing Princeton’s freshman point guard, Douglas Davis, every time he touched the ball, which happened all too often.
Davis personified the idea that the point guard sets the tone for the rest of his team, in every way. Apparently more concerned with accumulating highlights for his And1 Tour audition than with the game itself, Davis followed a simple formula over and over again: receive inbounds pass, bust out several unnecessary crossovers and spin moves, find enough space to force a bad shot, release.
Everything about him—from his selfish play to his smug body language—plowed through the border that separates swagger from plain arrogance.
To make things worse, the kid was good, and the swooning of a Harvard girl a few seats away from me, whose crush on Davis caused her to actively root against the Crimson whenever he was in the game, brought back memories of every conversation I’ve had that started like this: “Look, you’re a really nice guy, but…”
And Davis was just the beginning.
With just over 30 seconds left in the game and Harvard down 68-65, Princeton shooting guard Dan Mavraides nailed a three, plunging a dagger into the Crimson’s aspirations of victory. After the shot swished through the net, Mavraides held his arm in the air, mimicking his follow-through motion.
Fine, I get it. You hit a big shot, you’re happy. But as seconds passed, the hand didn’t go down. Mavraides began to parade around with his arm up, even running up to his teammates to show them, just in case they didn’t notice. The jeers of the Harvard crowd did nothing to increase the force of gravity on Mavraides’ arm, and the sizeable Princeton contingent in the stands went nuts in support of their guy.
The whole scene made me queasy, and I tried to look away, but the only other thing to focus on was the Hair Club for Men gone horribly wrong that calls itself the Tigers’ frontcourt. Apparently one of the hazing rituals for guys over 6’7 on the Princeton basketball team involves growing your hair as long as possible and then turning the lights out in the locker room while your teammates attack your head with scissors.
I’m truly afraid to go to sleep tonight, because I don’t want to deal with the recurring dream I’ve been having where I get chased down a dark alleyway by two Rod Blagojevich impersonators and a living, breathing mullet. Look guys, as a fellow tall, goofy white dude, I can empathize. But this needs to stop.
Knowing that Princeton isn’t coming back to Cambridge this season and that I most likely won’t get to write about the Tigers again leaves me feeling bittersweet. True, I’m done for good with Princeton’s trio of Young Frankensteins and their cocky, insufferable teammates. But not since my days of bashing Dartmouth football had I drank as lustily from the Fountain of Haterade as I did during Saturday night’s game.
Now the moment is gone, the briefly reclaimed piece of my soul once again stripped away from me. With no clear object of my scorn, I can only hope to be lucky enough to be present when the next douchey Ivy squad comes to town. Either that, or travel to Providence when the Harvard baseball team goes to Brown this spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—The Harvard women’s hockey team has had more than its fair share of bad luck this season. But last night, it seemed that the squad could do no wrong.The Crimson (11-7-3, 10-4-2 ECAC) turned in a completely dominating performance, routing Boston University (13-10-5, 7-6-3-3 Hockey East), 8-0, in the first round of the Beanpot Tournament at Northeastern’s Matthews Arena.Tri-captains Sarah Vaillancourt and Jenny Brine turned in matching hat tricks to pace Harvard to its biggest offensive output since the 2007 Beanpot consolation game.“I think we’re starting to roll a little bit, get some confidence, and you can see it in the kids’ eyes,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “How they deliver the puck, share the puck, and communicate, it’s very, very different than it was a month ago.”Harvard jumped out in front just three minutes into the game, and the team never looked back.The Crimson set up on its first power play, and a series of well-executed passes from sophomore Kate Buesser and junior Anna McDonald brought the puck to junior Jen Brawn’s stick. The defenseman powered it home from just outside the left circle to give Harvard all the offense it would need on the night.But the team didn’t stop there. With junior Kathryn Farni in the box at 7:32, Vaillancourt saw an opportunity and seized it.The tri-captain stole the puck, streaked down the ice, and after evading a defender, netted the puck for a shorthanded goal.The Terriers couldn’t get anything started offensively, faltering on the power play and generating just four shots in the first frame.The second period brought more quality scoring opportunities for the Crimson, but the team didn’t break through until halfway through the frame.Senior Kati Vaughn made an outlet pass up the ice to Vaillancourt, who connected with Brine standing just to the left of the net. Brine poked the puck past BU goaltender Allyse Wilcox to make the score 3-0.Just over two minutes later, Brine did it again, this time with a little help from her linemates.Vaillancourt brought the puck up the ice and made a nice pass to sophomore Katharine Chute as she spun to avoid a defender. Chute crossed the puck to Brine, who caught Wilcox out of position and dumped the puck into the wide-open right side of the net.All told, Harvard’s first line contributed 11 of the team’s 20 points.“It just happened that the puck just kept going our way,” Brine said. “We had Chute as a new linemate and she played a very good game, kept her head up the whole time and saw the ice very well.”That was the end of the second-period scoring, but the Crimson saved its best for last. The team exploded for four goals in the final frame.Just 18 seconds into the third, Vaughn and Vaillancourt connected for the team’s second power-play goal of the night. Vaughn found an open Vaillancourt in the slot, and the tri-captain hammered the puck home.And from there, Harvard kept rolling. At 3:27, Brine took a pass from Vaillancourt at the left post and buried the puck for her fourth career hat trick. McDonald was also credited with an assist on the play.Junior defenseman Cori Bassett got in on the fun at 11:26 on another Crimson power play. After sophomore Liza Ryabkina brought the puck up the ice, Harvard set up its offense. The puck passed around the circle from Vaughn to Vaillancourt and finally to Bassett, who wristed it home from the right circle.And to complete the scoring rampage, Vaillancourt took a pass from Ryabkina on the power play and broke towards the Terrier net. She went top-shelf to earn her second hat trick in four games.“It’s one of those games where you shoot at the net and it goes in,” Vaillancourt said. “The team has been playing really hard all season, and the luck hasn’t really been on our side. Maybe [this is] a turning point.”Not to be overlooked in the offensive onslaught was the solid performance of junior goalie Christina Kessler and her defense. Kessler made 17 saves and recorded her second clean sheet of the season.“We’ve had a history this season of letting teams get back in,” Brine said. “So it was nice that we really held strong the whole way, kept going strong against them, made it 8-0 and kept the 0…it’s good momentum.”Wilcox and BU junior Ashley Leichliter, who was making her collegiate debut, combined for 29 saves.The Crimson had the clear advantage on special teams, converting four of its 10 power plays while holding the Terriers scoreless in its six opportunities.“We were as good as we’ve been all year,” Stone said. “We played some great hockey tonight. They’re a good team, good goaltending, and we were able to expose their weaknesses. We like the way we’re playing right now.”Harvard will get the chance to defend its Beanpot title next Tuesday at 8 p.m. against Boston College.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard went above and beyond in securing a spot in the Beanpot final.  The Crimson offense was particularly in top form in the first round of the tournament. It was fast, fierce and hungry for goals, earning an 8-0 victory over Boston University.  “Well certainly it’s nice to see all of our lines clicking and [the] defense play with a lot of confidence, and our goaltender play with a lot of confidence,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It’s a great time to be playing some serious, fast hockey and that’s what we did tonight and that’s why we were able to take advantage of the situation from the beginning, right off the bat, all the way to the end.” Tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt scored three goals on the night, her second hat trick in four games, and had a hand in four of the other goals.  The first time she worked her magic was on the second goal of the night, at 7:32 into the first period. Vaillancourt single-handedly snagged the puck on a shorthanded play, drove it down the rink and made a shot straight over the goalie’s shoulder.  “I think it was just one of those plays where you think at first that you are going to dump the puck and then you see a full ice in front of you so you think you have to go and try for it,” Vaillancourt said. “My coaches have been telling me all season to shoot through a screen and I finally did… and it worked!” Vaillancourt’s second goal of the night came in a flash, just 18 seconds into the third period. Assisted by senior Kati Vaughn, the tally was scored on the last leg of a power play. Vaillancourt earned her seventh point after scoring the eighth and final goal of the night. While this may seem like a grand feat, this is not unprecedented for Vaillancourt, who has a career high of eight points in one game.   HAPPY AND HEALTHY The Crimson has been plagued by injury throughout the season, but thanks to a long, hard exam period all team members are good to go.  While some practical adjustments have been made, the team’s success of late has largely been a product of its return to full health. “We made a few changes…but we are also finally healthy,” Stone said. “[You] can’t underestimate the value of having everybody healthy. And so everybody is back in the lineup. “We just had exams, and that was physically [and] emotionally taxing,” she added. “[But] we were able to rest a little bit while other teams were banging each other up. BEANPOT MEANS A LOT Harvard’s win moves the team into the final round of the tournament, in which the Crimson will take on Boston College in its quest for a 13th Beanpot title.“It means a lot to us,” Stone said. “It’s certainly the pride of Boston to win the Beanpot, but it’s also a great experience for your athletes to compete for a championship before the end of the regular season.”  With Harvard battling for both supremacy in its conference and a spot in the national rankings, the Beanpot gives the team a chance to play in a high-pressure environment before the playoffs even begin. “It’s tough, it’s mid-week, we’re shopping classes all day and people come to the rink a little tired,” tri-captain Jenny Brine said. “But [we need to] really focus in and realize what we have at stake here, a championship in mid-February, which is a big deal.” Brine, a seasoned veteran of the Boston hockey scene, knows the significance of participating in this historic tournament, and she and her classmates have made sure that the rest of the Crimson squad understands as well. “I think definitely the senior class knows the importance of the Beanpot, the history of it with Harvard hockey,” Brine said. “I think it’s our job as seniors to especially let our freshmen know how much of a big deal this really is for us.”
