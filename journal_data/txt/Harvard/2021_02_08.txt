After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I knew it was a bad idea to ask my hairdresser why he wouldn’t let his son wear a princess dress. But I never thought it was going to lead to a full-fledged screaming match in the salon, one that included a shocking declaration that anyone who respected members of the BGLTQ community had no morals or ethics. I never thought it would mean that this man cutting my hair — a friend — could look at me with such contempt. And I certainly hadn’t anticipated the overwhelming culpability for this ruined relationship as I stood, alone, on the noisy street corner outside, unfinished hair dripping down my back.
“I can’t do someone’s hair who has different values than I do.”
Was intolerance a value? Discrimination a tenet of his business? I think my hairdresser meant he could never have a client with differing political beliefs. All I heard was “you’re not welcome here.”
Who knew being socially conservative was a prerequisite to highlights and a trim?
I imagine in other places (I’m from Florida) the opposite is true. That is, there’s no way a far-right QAnon reader could openly express their views here on campus and hope to be met with anything but disdain. Rightly so, in my opinion.
Yet the fact remains: Different locations are biased towards different ideologies. This is a reality we may forget in the liberal bubble that is Harvard Square, but shouldn’t we be concerned about the repercussions for those in the political minority, wherever they may be?
I’ve witnessed classmates endure very real consequences after voicing an unpopular opinion in casual conversation — the least of which might be public humiliation. When this happens to people whose beliefs we deem “worthy” of condemnation at a party or in class, we don’t bat an eye.
What we fail to acknowledge is that these daily caustic interactions, beyond unpleasant, are actually harmful when conducted in the wrong manner. They sow animosity in an already contentious dialogue. And when we allow ostracization to happen — even to people with whom we vehemently disagree — we also harm ourselves because, somewhere else, we could be them.
Instead, we should be intentional about political conversations, going into them with the acknowledgement that there are a multitude of lived experiences and backgrounds informing our classmates' beliefs. Understanding where someone is coming from, though we might disagree, is the first step towards meaningful dialogue. Otherwise, our intolerance acts as simply the enemy of necessary, productive discourse as it did for me and my hairdresser.
Of course, I firmly disagreed with what my hairdresser said in the salon that day. His overt homophobia was something I found unacceptable and, frankly, repulsive. His intolerance for anyone who disagreed with him was all the more concerning. I would have loved nothing more than for him to consider our exchange, realize he was wrong, and reform his entire belief system; but I honestly think I might’ve had a better shot at convincing him unicorns were real. If I truly hoped to alter his perspective, I should have started by waiting for a moment where a longer, more thoughtful dialogue could occur.
Party affiliation today means more than it ever has. When we discuss politics on campus and with our friends, we’re discussing matters of principle that for many of our peers have a very real impact. Hoping to change someone’s stance on an issue that, for them, is an integral component of their identity is impractical — at least when conducted in the form of a passing conversation in the breakfast line at Annenberg, or a public and personal condemnation in class.
Yes, we might be eager to engage in a relevant debate with a friend. And yes, not talking about politics is a privilege only few can afford. We need to be having these conversations, and we need to be having them with urgency. But in my experience, where and how we center these discussions matters. (My choice of a chaotic salon as the stage for my grand intercession, for example, left me ousted and alone. Like, literally. I was stranded on the curb.)
So in a time when it’s so hard to separate politics from the daily, maybe that's exactly what we need. Turning every interaction into an opportunity to change the beliefs of those we disagree with only leaves us surrounded by those with whom we agree. And in our unrelenting battle to convince others, we are left further entrenched in our own beliefs — the epitome of polarization.
In the wrong settings, political conversations become unproductive, even harmful. We should engage in discussion with classmates about issues we care about, but we need to be careful about where and how we do it. If we don’t, we run the risk of our arguments falling on deaf ears.
Let’s save our opinions for situations where they will have an impact beyond isolating others. Explore, talk, and (more importantly) listen to others. But don’t feel compelled to have these conversations everywhere.
We can’t save the world by screaming at our hairdressers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard continues to stand up for its race-conscious admissions policies against a lawsuit widely expected to reach the Supreme Court, it is instructive to examine how affirmative action became one of the most contentious social and political issues in higher education. This column is dedicated to examining the shifting narratives surrounding affirmative action: the changing arguments in favor of it, the arguments against it, and where it fits into the American cultural and racial landscape today.
The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 represented a watershed moment in the long and arduous struggle for racial equality in the United States. The Voting Rights Act secured Black Americans the right to vote, enforcing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The Civil Rights Act — specifically Title VII, which prohibited employment discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and national religion — secured for them the right to take up jobs without fear of discrimination. Having achieved, at least on paper, a notion of racial equality, the focus of the civil rights movement turned to securing economic equality for African Americans: equality not just of status, but of opportunity. At the core of that continuing struggle stands affirmative action.
Most people, regardless of political, racial, or social affiliation, would not contest two basic facts about race relations in the United States: first, that the country has a prolonged history of oppression and discrimination against African Americans, and that this constitutes a grievous harm; second, that despite the equal legal status of African Americans, racial discrimination and inequality persist to this day. And if you accept that a historic wrong continues to be prevalent today, presumably you also accept that we (society) must do something to correct it.
In this formulation, affirmative action — a fancy name for doing something to account for a wrong — seems almost uncontroversial. It is only when we move past the need to do something and start to consider what that entails that a divergence emerges.
Scholars have long debated how a just affirmative action program should treat historically disadvantaged groups. Some advocate expanding opportunity for such groups while avoiding explicit distinctions along racial lines. Others emphasize the need for preferential policies in order to counter decades of systemic racism and ensure adequate representation.
Of those two schools of thought, the first traces its roots back to the original conception of the term “affirmative action.” In 1961, President John F. Kennedy ’40 signed Executive Order 10925, wherein the phrase was first mentioned. In the Kennedy administration’s own words, the idea was to ensure that “Americans of all colors and beliefs will have equal access to employment within the government, and with those who do business with the government.” In other words, employers should not treat any applicant unfairly on account of race; nor should any employee be subjected to racial discrimination.
In his book The Affirmative Action Puzzle, Melvin Urofsky describes this as “soft” affirmative action: a vaguely defined policy that spoke of “equal access” (best understood as encouraging all races to apply for jobs). By mandating equal treatment of applicants and employees, this approach requires nothing more than banishing race as a factor in the hiring and training of workers. At the crux of this version of affirmative action lies the belief that the law should be “colorblind,” in line with Kennedy’s proclamation in a televised speech in 1963 that “race has no place in American life or law.” Doing something to prevent discrimination, then, simply involves enforcement of existing anti-discrimination laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, and, at best, increased efforts to attract applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups.
The second school of thought traces its roots to the aftermath of the civil rights movement that culminated with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. Throughout the movement, activists had subscribed to the colorblind theory, believing that the elimination of discriminatory laws and subsequent attainment of equal legal status would be a catalyst for greater economic equality. Instead, although the civil rights legislation of the 1960s did much to improve the economic condition of Black families, not everyone benefited equally. As Urofsky describes it, “they [civil rights leaders] ignored a fact that had long been known: a merit-based economy guarantees that many people — those least qualified educationally or occupationally — will be stuck at the bottom.”
Black Americans’ overrepresentation among America’s impoverished population, especially when compared to white Americans, persisted after the passage of “colorblind” anti-discrimination laws. These practical inadequacies of the soft, colorblind notion of affirmative action led to demands for what Urofsky calls “hard” affirmative action policies — programs that involved giving preferential treatment to disadvantaged groups in order to compensate for past discrimination and ensure a “critical mass” of people from minority groups.
As we will explore in following weeks, the divergence among these two approaches — should members of a race be accorded preferential treatment to account for past discrimination? — forms the crux of modern affirmative action jurisprudence. Six decades on from Kennedy’s executive order, as the country once again struggles with a racial reckoning, affirmative action has grown ever more controversial and divisive. No lasting settlement on the issue is in sight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students often enter college bright-eyed and with aspirations to change the world. However, the state of play on campus (and by this, we mean how consulting recruitment season is as ingrained a time of year here as winter) means that we enter with this enthusiasm only to be pipelined through specific internships right into the world of finance, consulting, or tech: 63 percent of the Class of 2020 graduated into these careers.
None of these paths are inherently unworthy, but they hardly seem worthy enough to command the labor of over half of all seniors entering the workforce any given year. It’s unfortunate that landing a job in tech, finance, or consulting can feel like the only yardstick to measure the success of your four years here. For some, a Harvard education is more a travel guide to certain six-figure jobs, rather than a chance to transform their bright-eyed passion into real improvements in the outside world.
In this sense, Harvard has managed to select for butterflies, then metamorphose them back into caterpillars.
Against this backdrop, it really is no surprise that Economics has prevailed as Harvard’s most popular concentration this year, attracting almost 15 percent of all declaring sophomores. The concentration offers students a clear, well-charted path to follow if they want to nab coveted finance and consulting jobs. Of course, you can do more with an economics degree than join McKinsey or manage a hedge fund. Still, a quick survey of the Economics departmental site reveals its not-so-subtle emphasis on the many for-profit and lucrative businesses its graduates have entered, citing finance and consulting at the top of its employment prospects listing. The overbearing presence of consulting on campus and sophomores picking Ec more than any other concentration are clearly linked.
We are not disputing the importance of economics as a discipline, nor do we mean to disparage anyone’s individual career or concentration choices. But we do feel the need to lay plain that Economics doesn’t reign supreme because it represents an inherently superior path to that offered by any other concentration — believing so would be antithetical to the very core of the liberal arts education.
Our discomfort with the popularity of Ec and, by extension, finance and consulting, lies in knowing there is more to life than receiving a return offer from your hyper-competitive junior summer internship, while also knowing that the pressure to secure such positions is so high that this fact can get lost in the mix. The question is a real one: What do you even do at Harvard if not consulting?
Look no further than President Joe Biden’s inauguration, where poet and Harvard graduate Amanda S. C. Gorman ’20, a sociology concentrator during her time at Harvard, beautifully demonstrated the power of art and the humanities. Hyper-focusing on high-paying fields to the detriment of other disciplines negates their value and can prevent incredibly talented graduates from pursuing the humanities or social sciences, as Gorman so winningly did during her time at Harvard.
We have all been, some time or another, seduced by material promises, beckoned by the calls of concentrations that promise a fruitful, comfortable, and secure future. Their allure is that of the path of least resistance, of clear goals and hefty economic rewards. It is easy to stay within the confines of concentration requirements and recruitment windows, marching towards achievable prerequisites and established careers. And the uncertainty and anxiety of deviating from this are only dramatized in a society that is extremely acquisitive and competitive.
But kowtowing to such pressures probably isn’t the point of a Harvard education, not unless we take the “deeply transformative” experience admissions promotes to mean crushingly homogenizing. If the University wants to encourage students to pursue their passions it should work to demonstrate that there are, indeed, practical and gainful career avenues for concentrators outside of economics and the applied sciences. A good starting point would be ensuring that the Office of Career Services more effectively promotes resources in these overlooked areas.
Increased academic flexibility is similarly crucial. Pigeoning sophomores into a discipline and restricting their access to others — by, for example, forbidding joint degree programs — only limits our intellectual growth. Concentrations that take this or other exclusionary approaches, from Economics to the Engineering Sciences, ought to rethink their policies.
Students themselves should also be pushing the boundaries of their own academic comfort zone, probing beyond their field of study through General Education courses, secondaries, and foreign language citations. Whether it be exploring the rich offerings of classes outside one’s concentration, or the array of non-finance, non-consulting career paths that are easily accessible to Harvard graduates, we encourage our fellow students to expand their horizons; to take something for the sake of it, and not because you’re eyeing how it’ll look on your resume under “Relevant Coursework.”
The pull of Economics and the big three (finance, tech, consulting) is unlikely to stop anytime soon. But pausing to question why we have allowed just three career paths to dominate undergraduate and postgraduate life so completely is a worthwhile exercise. Surely something beautiful (or hey, at least interesting) would come from more students pursuing passion over profit and going against the grain.

Like many Harvard students, Nabin Poudel ’24 stays up late to complete his assignments in time for typical midnight deadlines.
Unlike others, though, midnight in Cambridge falls around 10 a.m. local time the next morning for Poudel, who is taking classes online from his home in Nepal this academic year.
“Sometimes I would find myself working [the] whole night on assignments,” Poudel said.
Though a federal policy barring international students enrolled in online-only academic programs — including Harvard’s — from residing in the United States was reversed last summer, the about-face did not apply to freshmen.
“I am writing today to share the difficult news that our first-year international students will not be able to come to campus this fall,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a July 21 email to international freshmen.
For the fall semester, the College welcomed freshmen in the U.S. back to campus, as well as a select number of international upperclassmen. Juniors, seniors, and students with special circumstances are living in Harvard’s dorms for the spring semester, which began on Jan. 25.
All the while, international freshmen remain locked out of Harvard’s gates. As of June, international students made up 11.5 percent of the Class of 2024.
More than 20 international freshmen interviewed said their first semester of college was marked by nocturnal schedules, social isolation, and inadequate support from the College. Many said they feel pessimistic that things will get better this spring.
Khurana told The Crimson in a late January interview that he acknowledges the College’s efforts to support international freshmen have been flawed.
“I wanted to acknowledge right up front, these efforts have not been perfect,” he said. “The College has been constrained by public health guidance, by uncertainties and unpredictabilities.”
Khurana also commended international students for adapting to their circumstances.
“I’m really grateful for their patience [and] have been inspired by the work that they are doing,” he said.
Though she tried to make the most of the fall, Matilda Marcus ’24, who took classes at home in England, said her first semester was distressing.
“There are 100 of us who are all living a unique experience that nobody at Harvard has ever experienced,” Marcus said. “And nobody seems to care.”
Less than a week before the start of the fall semester, while most students finalized course schedules and browsed syllabi, S. Tabasom H. Monfared ’24 was trying to access Zoom.
Monfared, who spent the fall at home in Iran, said she had difficulty using digital applications required for her online classes.
“Because we’re under the U.S. sanctions, I cannot use Canvas, Gradescope, even my Harvard email without using [a Virtual Private Network],” she said. “I contacted my dean [and] the [Harvard] International Office, and I told them, ‘What should I do? Because Zoom is prohibited.’”
Though Monfared was eventually able to download a VPN, she said the last-minute inconvenience was “very stressful.”
Once she gained access to Zoom, Monfared would join the video platform late at night to attend her courses from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time. Often, she said, she stayed up after class working on problem sets.
More than a dozen international freshmen also said they attended classes after 10 p.m. in their local time zones with some lectures, sections, and office hours running into the early hours of the morning.
Samuel H. Taylor ’24, who studied at home in New Zealand, said conforming to an Eastern time zone schedule — roughly 18 hours behind his local time — was necessary to participate in “anything interesting or vaguely specialized.”
In Sri Lanka, group work kept V. Suneragiri P. Liyanage ’24 up until 9:30 a.m. the next morning “many times,” he said.
Khurana said the College has introduced a new tool that will show course instructors the time zones in which their students live, enabling them to “make more informed decisions” as they plan for this semester.
Many international freshmen said teaching staff were already empathetic toward their circumstances, and that they enjoyed their coursework.
Sakiko Miyazaki ’24 said her instructors worked “their butts off” to help her.
One professor, Miyazaki said, emailed her directly about his willingness to accommodate her time difference after she indicated interest in his class.
“I really, really appreciated that because I had to cold email professors out of the blue, being like, ‘Hi, this is a random freshman from Tokyo, Japan. I would love to take your class, but your time doesn’t work. Would you be able to consider accommodations?’” she said.
Still, Wamalwa Ochieng ’24, who took classes from Kenya, said the University should be more considerate of the unique disadvantages facing international students.
“I don’t think they’d ever expect domestic students to wake up at 3 a.m. in the morning to attend class,” he said. “I don’t think they’d ever expect domestic students to choose classes that just work within specific times.”
Miles, oceans, and time zones away from Harvard Yard, international freshmen also said they felt isolated from the rest of their class, and that they sometimes questioned their connection to Harvard.
“If you were to ask me whether I’m a Harvard student right now, I would think for a second,” Liyanage said. “I’m more connected to my high school right now.”
Many students said they struggled to balance sleep with nocturnal extracurricular schedules and sought friendships transcending hemispheres to limited success.
Fadzai M. Ngwerume ’24 said her social life last semester was “a bit of a disappointment.” Due to the fact that most club meetings occurred in the middle of the night local time in South Africa, she said she “gave up” on attending.
Poudel said he had looked forward to joining clubs at Harvard to find a niche on campus. His inability to participate due to the time difference, he said, was “the worst thing that happened” during his fall semester.
Marcus said she was discouraged by the dearth of opportunities to get to know her classmates beyond Zoom breakout room discussions.
“I look at [my classmates] and I’m like, ‘I think that we would be really, really good friends,’” she said. “‘I can see a really good friendship blossoming from this,’ but not having any opportunity to explore that friendship in any way.”
Many international freshmen said the First-Year International Program — an annual pre-orientation program for students who live abroad — helped them get to know other students in similar circumstances.
Still, as they look ahead to blocking — the annual process in which freshmen choose classmates with whom they want to live in an upperclassman house — some international freshmen said they feel unprepared.
Danai-Christina Avdela ’24, who took classes from Greece, said blocking is “really weird and difficult” for international freshmen this year.
“Even if you have people you want to block with, you haven’t really met them in person,” she said. “You don’t really know if you can live with them.”
Having never spent a semester on campus, Marcus said she does not understand blocking’s significance.
“I can’t engage in any blocking discourse,” she said. “I can’t engage in the like, ‘I don’t want to be put here. I want to be put here.’”
“I don’t know what anything looks like — I’ve never seen a building,” she added.
Nekesa C. Straker, senior assistant dean of residential life and first-year students, wrote in an email that the Dean of Students Office has “coordinated” with the Office of International Education to “best support [the] international student population.”
The DSO created a new position, which has been filled by a graduate student, to serve international freshmen, Straker added.
Marcus said the rigor of the fall semester forced her to invert her sleep schedule. She said she would go to bed at 5 or 6 a.m. and start her day around 2 or 3 p.m. local time.
That lifestyle had “major effects” on her mental and physical health, including rapid weight loss, and prompted her to seek therapy.
“All of my classes were in the dark,” Marcus said. “I had to decide to either not get enough sleep or sleep enough and not see any daylight.”
“All you do is wake up and work, and go to sleep, and then wake up and work, and our mental, emotional, physical well-being is thrown aside for productivity,” she said. “It feels like I’m serving Harvard and not serving myself.”
Others said their mental health suffered without strong support networks.
“It’s really hard to text a friend and be like, ‘Hi, I’m sad. Please make me feel better,’” Miyazaki said. “There’s often a point where you’re like, ‘Oh, is it worth it?’”
Samuel Ho ’24 said he felt “caught in the middle” between his academic commitments to Harvard and his life in Singapore. Away from campus, he said he does not feel “important to anyone.”
“You just feel like you don’t really matter to anyone,” Ho said. “You really feel like you’re just out of sight, out of mind.”
Barbara Lewis, chief of the University’s Counseling and Mental Health Services, wrote in an emailed statement that CAMHS “is unable to provide individual therapy or medication management” to students living outside of the U.S. and in states with legal restrictions.
“We welcome participation in our CAMHS workshops by students who are residing anywhere, including internationally,” Lewis wrote. “We also provide initial consultations remotely and may make suggestions on how to pursue counseling or medication management locally in your area of residence.”
Palis “Fresh” Pisuttisarun ’24, who studied from home in Thailand, said he believes Harvard failed to acknowledge international freshmen’s particular mental health struggles.
“Harvard implicitly invalidated these feelings by not explicitly reciprocating and recognizing the struggles,” he said.
Ana Breznik ’24, who took classes from Slovenia, said she felt “left out” after reading Harvard’s announcement of its spring semester plans, which offered condolences to sophomores not invited to campus, but made no mention of international freshmen.
“Harvard is often telling us how crucial we are and how invaluable our unique experiences are,” Breznik said. “Sometimes we feel left out still because the actions sometimes speak otherwise.”
Many international freshmen criticized Harvard for sparse communication regarding their access to campus this spring, including whether they would be able to secure a visa. Breznik said she received only one email throughout the fall providing her information on U.S. visa guidelines.
Overall, students said they did not receive adequate support and counsel from Harvard as they struggled to navigate an unusual first semester.
Office of International Education Director Camila L. Nardozzi said her office — which provides advising to international students and students studying abroad — can only “advocate” for international students, rather than change Harvard’s policies.
“All we can do is advocate and ask people to really think about first-year international students,” she said. “We can’t enforce that those things happen.”
Nardozzi said she acknowledges “gaps existed” in the OIE’s support of international students.
Unsatisfied with the College’s communication, international freshmen took it upon themselves to contact administrators seeking answers and relaying their concerns.
Taylor said he felt compelled to pen a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow detailing his fall struggles because he does not believe the University has “any clue of what life has been like” for students abroad.
“I’ve always been a fan of the idea that education is the great leveler or the great equalizer,” he said. “The experience that the University has left us this semester has left first-year international students feeling like they are second-class members of the Harvard community.”
Marcus, who met with Khurana to air her grievances, said she thought it was unfair students bore the responsibility to contact the College to obtain vital information.
“We’re finding out incredibly fundamental parts of our college experience through the notes of one-on-one meetings,” she said.
Poudel, who also met with Khurana, said he appreciated him for taking the meeting. At the same time, Poudel said it would be more productive if College administrators hosted a forum for international freshmen to voice their concerns and brainstorm solutions.
Khurana said the College has taken a “two-pronged approach” to address international freshmen’s academic and social concerns: strengthening individual advising and offering more frequent information updates.
Even with those ongoing efforts, Ho said he feels hopeless.
“It’s so easy to be forgotten when you don’t have a physical seat at the table,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to release a statement in favor of the abolishment of Harvard's add-drop period course change fee during a Sunday meeting.
The legislation calls for a statement to be issued calling on the University to remove the fee owed by students who change their courses after the third Monday of the semester. The fee requires students to pay $10 for each class added or dropped from their schedules after this deadline.
“For whatever reason, Harvard College charges students a fee to add, drop, or change courses after the third Monday of each semester,” the statement reads. “The imposition of this fee serves as an unnecessary financial barrier that prevents many Harvard students from taking full advantage of the course add/drop period.”
The legislation was sponsored by Quincy House Representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22. Since the UC does not have the power to abolish the fee, Cheng said he hopes the statement brings the idea to the attention of the University.
The UC also voted to allocate $5,000 to the Books Fund to help offset the costs of textbooks for students experiencing financial difficulties amid the coronavirus pandemic. The fund — sponsored by Council President Noah A. Harris ’22, Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22, and First Year Class Committee Chair Esther Xiang ’23 — plans to serve up to 100 students and disburse up to $50 in aid to eligible applicants.
The UC also passed legislation to fund a printing and laundry subsidy for on-campus students.
Sponsored by Harris and Gan, the legislation will provide a $20 Crimson Cash subsidy to 200 students and will partner with Gnomon Copy to provide $11 allowances to 150 students.
In response to student feedback, the UC also introduced “open hours,” a monthly town hall to facilitate discussions between students and UC members.
“Open Hours will be available to the entirety of the student body, will serve a mode of transparent conversation between representatives and constituents, and will be recognized as an opportunity for constituents to seek clarification on, provide feedback on, and even suggest legislation,” the legislation reads.
Open hours will be scheduled at various times throughout the month to accommodate students in different time zones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a University report that indicated the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology houses the remains of formerly enslaved people within its collections, anthropology scholars and curator advocates called on Harvard to promote conversations regarding museums’ roles in perpetuating racism.
At the end of January, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the results of a Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology review, which found that the museum’s collections include the remains of 15 individuals of African descent who were likely alive during the time of slavery in the United States.
Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and chair of the presidential initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, a University-wide effort to examine the legacy of slavery at Harvard, responded to Bacow’s announcement in a note to Radcliffe staff.
“This terrible discovery calls for an urgent response,” she wrote.
Inspired by the ongoing initiative on the legacy of slavery at Harvard, Peabody Museum staff started to inspect its archives to determine if they contained remains of people of African descent who lived during the period of American slavery, museum director Jane Pickering said in an interview.
Pickering said this search, and the subsequent apology, were part of the Museum’s approach to “ethical stewardship,” which she said involves reckoning with practices it has held since its founding.
“There were collecting practices that just completely disregarded the affected communities,” she said. “That to me is at the heart of it all. Museums were part of the colonial enterprise.”
Pickering added the Museum is “very highly confident” that the remains Bacow referred to in his letter are the only ones of people who were possibly enslaved in America in the Museum’s collections.
Tamara K. Lanier, who is currently suing the University and the Peabody Museum for possession of daguerreotypes of enslaved people she says are her ancestors, said the Peabody’s possession of the remains of enslaved people in its collections is part of a larger curatorial pattern.
“They have a moral responsibility to restore dignity to these people whose bodies have been exploited and to give them the burial that they deserve,” she said. “They have an obligation to find the families of these people, and offer a formal apology for failing to do the right thing.”
“This revelation confirms for me what I have already known – that they are unethical stewards of the daguerreotypes and other cultural property,” Lanier added.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment. A Peabody Museum spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Dan Hicks, a professor of archaeology at Oxford University and the curator of world archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, said that collecting human remains was once a “central method and practice of anthropology.”
“Harvard is not alone in having significant collections of human remains of Black and brown people who were subject to colonialism, to slavery, to military violence, to a whole host of processes in which [academia] was to some degree complicit,” Hicks said.
Human remains in anthropology museums have “a central role in these histories of racism, histories of violence, histories of dispossession,” Hicks said.
“But those histories are not over, and the museum is an institution that makes those histories last,” he added.
Hicks noted the fact that these collections remain calls for a kind of work that has not yet taken place.
“It’s an indictment of how anthropology has failed to face up to its ongoing colonial legacy that we don't have the facts – the curatorial work has not been done to find out as much as we can possibly know about collections of this kind,” he said.
The Peabody Museum played a role in that history, according to Pickering. She said the work that lies ahead will require learning about the human remains in the collection and consulting with relevant groups about their future.
“We’re going to be doing a deep dive into the archives and thinking about repatriation and burial,” Pickering said. “We are really committed to trying to think with communities about our ethical responsibilities to them.”
She added that anthropology museums have a role in promoting ongoing discussions about the legacies of racism and colonialism.
“I think anthropology museums are places where you can talk about these issues because they’re very real, and so moving forward they provide a place to to act as well as to think about the past,” she said.
Hicks also said it will be important that “descendants and survivor communities” be involved in these decisions.
“We’re not going to get it right if we don’t foreground people,” he said.
Hicks added that the role is one the University is well-placed to take up.
“Harvard is in a great position – it’s got the resources, it’s got the intellectual capacity to lead and show how many other museums outside of universities are able to address these issues,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of enrolled undergraduates remains roughly 20 percent below enrollment levels during previous academic years as the College continues to operate remotely due to the pandemic.
As of Thursday, 5,177 students were enrolled at the College for the spring semester, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane. Dane noted that leaves of absence are still being processed by the Administrative Board.
In contrast, 6,755 College students enrolled during the 2019-2020 academic year, per Common Data Set filings.
Last fall, 5,382 undergraduates were enrolled as of the deadline for which students can opt to take the semester off without incurring a fee. As of that deadline this spring, Jan. 29, 5,227 students were enrolled.
The College conducted courses remotely during the fall and invited freshmen to live in Harvard’s dorms as well as students with special circumstances. This spring, the College invited seniors, juniors, and students with challenging learning environments back to campus to continue to take classes online.
Consistent with the fall semester, the Class of 2022 remains the smallest undergraduate cohort with 1,163 enrolled juniors this spring.
By contrast, 1,417 members of the Class of 2021 enrolled, making it the largest cohort. This spring, 1,354 freshmen and 1,243 sophomores enrolled.
More than 1,700 students are living on campus in the spring, including 655 seniors, 451 juniors, 414 freshmen, and 257 sophomores, as of Jan. 29, according to Dane.
Some students said they declared a leave of absence this spring after enrolling in the fall semester, but finding it marked by virtual classes, limited social opportunities, and canceled athletics.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a late January interview that he encourages students debating whether to take a leave of absence to “make the best decisions for themselves.”
“Our goal has really been to provide information and advice and resources to help facilitate those decisions,” Khurana said. “Our focus is on the students right now who are currently enrolled, whether they are off campus or on campus.”
“We look forward to welcoming back students who’ve chosen to take a leave when they decide they want to come back,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, a recent Kennedy School alum, ascended to the post of Prime Minister of Mongolia on Jan. 27 following his predecessor’s resignation in response to protests over the country’s Covid-19 response.
Luvsannamsrai, who was confirmed by Mongolia’s parliament with 87.9 percent approval is, at forty years old, the world's seventh-youngest head of state currently in office.
Luvsannamsrai was raised in the rural mining community of Berkh, Khentii, and served two terms in Parliament after graduating from the Kennedy School in 2015. During his time at Harvard, Luvsannamsrai developed a close circle of confidants among Mongolian international students, ultimately recruiting several to work in Mongolia’s government.
Among them was Business School alum Batnairamdal Otgonshar, a former Wall Street investment banker, who returned home to become Mongolia’s Vice Minister of Mining and Heavy Industry.
“There were five graduate students from Mongolia during that time, and then we used to hang out basically every Friday at the John Harvard [Brewery and Ale House],” Otgonshar said. “He used to tell us about Mongolian politics, and what we could contribute to Mongolia and how we see the long term vision for the country.”
Otgonshar said that Luvsannamsrai would use these discussions to encourage his peers to think about how what they learned in class could be applied to improve life in Mongolia.
Erdenetulga Rentsen, an HBS student from Mongolia, said Luvsannamsrai’s appointment represents a generational shift as well as a shift in national priorities towards digitally transforming Mongolia.
“It’s really a testament of change that’s about to happen in Mongolia,” Rentsen said. “With the world, the way it’s changing, right now, coal is about to get replaced with renewable energies and all sorts of other things. We only have a limited amount of time to essentially structurally change Mongolia for a different type of path and different types of prosperity.”
According to Rentsen, Luvsannamsrai is inspiring Western-educated Mongolian students to return home to shape their country’s future.
“I think in the past, when we do go to Harvard, we always have this feeling that we’ve been able to get out of a developing country, and then now we’ve finally arrived in the dream, America,” Rentsen said. “I think with Oyun-Erdene going back to Mongolia, and really creating this hope, but also bringing a lot of us back to Mongolia, I think it’s creating a new different channel.”
Zorigoo Tugsbayar ’15, another Mongolian student, said Luvsannamsrai’s return to his home country sets an example for other Mongolian students.
“He always had grand ambitions for the future of Mongolia. Obviously, I was a cynic back then, and I’m still a cynic now, but I’m truly impressed at how much he has accomplished so far,” said Tugsbayar, a former Crimson Multimedia chair. “I always have been conflicted whether to go back to Mongolia or not, but seeing someone of our generation be in such a decision-making spot makes the decision so much easier, perhaps.”
Rentsen said that only time will tell whether Luvsannamsrai’s vision will successfully translate into action.
“I think that he has been able to generate a lot of positive hope for the country, but that doesn’t mean that he has done his job,” Erdenetulga said. “He still has a lot to prove, for us and for the rest of the society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge began vaccinating residents 75 or older at the beginning of February as it entered the next phase of its Covid-19 vaccination program, though statewide and national vaccine shortages continue to hamper its rollout.
On Feb. 1, the state entered Phase Two of its vaccine distribution program, during which residents aged 75 or older became eligible to receive the vaccine.
Individuals aged 65 or older, school and public health workers, and individuals with comorbidities will also be able to receive the Covid-19 vaccine later in Phase Two, though the exact date is still unknown.
During Phase One, the City of Cambridge administered 1,231 vaccines to first responders and individuals experiencing homelessness, according to Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob, who presented an update on the city’s Covid-19 response during the Feb. 3 City Council meeting.
Per Jacob, the state of Massachusetts has capped Cambridge’s vaccination rollout at 100 vaccines per week, the same level as most other local health departments in the state. The city, however, is capable of administering roughly five times that amount — if not for statewide and nationwide vaccine shortages, according to Jacob.
To manage the limited supply, the state has been “triaging” distribution, with priority given to regional mass vaccination sites and limited allocation to cities and towns including Cambridge, Jacob said. Vaccine requests from local health departments have been limited to 100 at a time through February.
On Jan. 27, Massachusetts had vaccinated 523,721 individuals, using 67 percent of the state’s vaccine supply. As of last week, 98 percent of the state vaccine supply has been utilized or distributed. At Wednesday’s meeting, Jacob addressed rumors that the state is sitting on a stockpile of vaccines, calling them “simply not true.”
Jacob said the city plans to set up public vaccination clinics once the state provides enough doses for Cambridge to vaccinate residents who fall under Phase Two’s priority groups.
“We have the infrastructure,” Jacob said. “The issue is really about having sufficient doses on hand.”
The Massachusetts Department of Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.
Because Cambridge does not yet host a public vaccination site, residents aged 75 or older must rely on their pharmacies, medical providers, or mass vaccination sites outside of the City.
In conjunction with the state, the Cambridge Public Health Department has set in motion on-site vaccination for residents and staff of low-income, senior housing. On Feb. 1, the Cambridge Community Corps began vaccine information and registration outreach at local senior buildings. On-site vaccinations took place on Feb. 4 and Feb. 5.
The absence of public vaccination sites in Cambridge poses challenges to elderly residents who live alone, according to City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler. Sobrinho-Wheeler said residents aged 75 or older have to travel to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. — one of the state’s mass vaccination sites — or further to receive a dose, which is a difficult task for residents without cars.
“You have to make an appointment, and there aren’t enough appointments,” he said. “So that part is really frustrating.”
Cambridge resident Mary “Blue” B. Magruder ’69 said she was able to book an appointment at Gillette Stadium for her husband, who is 78.
Every time slot at the stadium had five to 25 appointments available, according to Magruder. While she said she was “very pleased” with her experience scheduling a Covid-19 vaccine, Magruder noted it might pose challenges for individuals without internet access or time to wait for an appointment opening.
Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services is providing free rides for eligible senior citizens to mass vaccination sites. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 also announced the launch of a call center on Feb. 5 to help residents book vaccine appointments if they have trouble with the state’s vaccine appointment website.
Cambridge resident Gaby Whitehouse said she and her husband — who are both over 75 years old — were able to receive the vaccine with relative ease due to her husband’s status as a minister.
“A friend of ours, who is a minister in Bedford, called us earlier in the week, and said they were giving priority to ministers,” she said. “He gave us a phone number, and just said ‘call there.’”
They received the vaccine on Feb. 1 — the first day people over 75 became eligible.
“It’s totally random and disorganized, frankly,” Whitehouse added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators across Harvard reflected on how experiences from the pandemic-afflicted academic year would affect education in the years ahead in a Graduate School of Education webinar Friday.
The latest installment in the school’s webinar series Education Now, the event featured GSE Dean Bridget Terry Long and Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Bharat N. Anand ’88, a Harvard Business School professor. The discussion was hosted by the University Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliot and moderated by Graduate School of Education lecturer Matthew L. Miller.
Though cognizant of the difficulties brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Anand said he sees several “clear advantages” to remote learning, with the first being the “collapsing” of time and space.
“Essentially, everyone is one click away from anyone else in the world,” he said.
Anand also lauded the benefits to non-linear communication, for example facilitated by the chat function on Zoom in which multiple students can participate and interact all at once without needing to go through students one by one.
Still, he noted, educators need to take advantage of these aspects of remote learning, rather than try to replicate the in-person classroom.
“If you don’t lean into these attributes of the digital media that make it better, and all you’re doing is simply trying to replicate or reproduce what you have in the in-person experience, inevitably it’ll be a worse experience,” Anand said.
Long said the shift to remote learning enabled the Graduate School of Education to hold an extra summer admissions period for its exclusively remote degree program. This allowed it to reach a broader set of students from all over the world, she said.
“What we quickly learned is that there are pools of talent all over the world who may not have been able to uproot and move to Cambridge,” Long said.
Anand and Long both said it is important not to compare and try to tailor online education to be an exact replica of residential learning.
“Treat the advantages of the digital medium on its own terms, as opposed to trying to mimic and match,” Anand said.
Long also noted that online education should not be treated as replacement of in-person learning.
“Technology is not a replacement for authentic interaction – it’s a tool,” she said.
In terms of the future of education, both administrators said educators and school leaders must be the ones to decide on the best path forward — whether remote education will be “just a blip or the new normal,” Long said.
She added online education can be very powerful if used as an expansion to residential learning rather than a replacement of it.
Anand said he and Long are part of a University-wide task force that launched Friday to examine the “transformative opportunities” for the future of teaching and learning that arise at Harvard during the remote learning period.
Like Long, he noted that merging both online and in-person methods of education can be of immense benefit, saying that the future of education can be one that joins the advantages of the different instruction methods.
“Let’s look at all the experiments, projects, initiatives that took place, and think about what this can mean for a multiplatform education going forward,” he said.

Whether you’re coming back to campus from the comforts of home and your childhood bedroom or a semester spent learning how to adult in an apartment, Flyby is here to help you readjust to the glamour and ease of dorm life — because let’s face it, we’re all clueless.
A Shower Caddy
You know them as the little baskets that carry all of your shower stuff. They’re essential to avoid making multiple trips between your dorm and your hallway bathroom, and to minimize the chance of getting locked out. Load up all of your toiletries into this baby and skamper awkwardly into the bathroom as you attempt to avoid anybody who may be walking down the hall. Alternatively, you can just not take any showers. Let us know how that works out for you!
A Mattress Protector
Or literally anything to protect your sheets from whatever else touched your bare mattress. Even your free service day t-shirt would work. You wouldn’t lie down on an uncovered dorm mattress, so why should your sheets, which touch you, be subjected to that torture? In fact, why not create as many protective layers between yourself and the mattress passed down from year to year? I’m talking about a foam mattress topper, an extra set of sheets, another blanket to lay on, you name it!
Definitely Not a Water Kettle
Since HUDS provides you with high-quality coffee and tea every morning, you will have no need for a portable kettle, so you can leave that at home! Definitely don’t bring one, since why would you want to make your own coffee in the mornings when you can’t be bothered to get dressed before your 9 a.m. (or your 12 p.m.)? And this semester, since room inspections can’t take place due to Covid, we should all be considerate and not bring a kettle. Just don’t.
Command Strips
Got some photos from times before everyone started wearing masks? String lights that you bought in an effort to make your dorm Pinterest-worthy? Get some Command strips to showcase it to the world! Whether it’s the team banner in the back of an athlete’s video feed or an organized to-do list, decorations are the easiest way to make sure everyone in your Zoom classes knows what you’re all about. And, you know, they can make the walls cheerier. That’s nice, too.
A Soul
We are still looking for the best place to buy this! This is the one thing that you ABSOLUTELY cannot skimp on. We recommend watching the new movie on Disney+ if you need help looking. Cheers!
