After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 1, Justice David H. Souter ’61 informed President Obama of his intention to resign. As the search for his successor commences, we applaud Souter for his 18 years of service as a member of the Supreme Court’s progressive caucus and encourage Obama to nominate in Souter’s stead a justice of comparable judicial philosophy.
Since he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 to replace Justice William Brennan, Souter, to the disappointment of conservatives, has proven to be a reliable liberal vote on the court. In 1992, he voted to uphold Roe v. Wade in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and ruled against prayer in schools in Lee v. Weisman. In 2000, he was among the four justices to side with former Vice President Al Gore ’69 in Bush v. Gore. Although his departure is unlikely to upset the court’s ideological status quo—as it is assumed that Obama will replace him with a similarly liberal justice—Souter also held other judicial notions that his successor ought to exemplify.
Writing in The New Republic, Gordon Silverstein labeled Souter a “judicial conservative,” explaining that, “Judicial conservatives generally have great respect for the law, and for legal decisions that have been made. This is the essence of what is called stare decisis—let the decision stand. Upholding precedent staunches the forces of change—and typically, that generates conservative results. But when the precedent you are upholding is precedent set by the Warren Court, holding back the forces of change means enforcing liberal decisions against radical demands for change from movement conservatives.”
Indeed, Souter’s conservative belief in upholding liberal precedents and stymieing the efforts of conservative activism is a quality Obama would do well to seek in his nominee. Additionally, in light of privacy concerns raised by the growing sophistication of search engines like Google and the perennial issue of net neutrality, we encourage the president to nominate an individual who is technologically proficient and well-versed in cyber law.
However, such discussion of philosophy and qualifications has been notably and disturbingly absent from the public discourse on Souter’s replacement. Instead, the discussion has been largely confined to identity politics.
Following Souter’s announcement, Sonia Sotomayor, an Hispanic federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, immediately became the de facto frontrunner to replace him. Other names that have been proffered include Virginia Representative Bobby Scott, an African American being promoted by the Congressional Black Caucus, and former Dean of Stanford Law School Kathleen Sullivan, a lesbian being promoted by the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund.
While all of these individuals are well-qualified legal minds, their race, gender, and sexual orientation should not be considered among their qualifications. 
Explaining her support for Sotomayor, La Raza president Janet Murguia explained, “There are high expectations because of the turnout we saw in the Latino community [in the 2008 election]. I think [picking a Hispanic] would go a long way to helping the Latino community feel they were recognized in terms of that support.” 
This mindset of regarding Supreme Court nominations as a means of rewarding a constituency for its political support is highly pernicious and poisons the nomination process. Furthermore, the pursuit of racial and sexual balance has no place in a process that should aspire to select justices based on the relevant criteria of intellect and principles, not the irrelevant criteria of complexion and anatomy.
In an interview for Politico, gay-rights advocate Dixon Osburn stated, “I don’t think [Obama] would shy away from [selecting a gay or lesbian nominee], but first and foremost he’s going to pick someone he thinks has constitutional gravitas.” 
Osburn is correct; while it would indeed be ideal to have a sexually and racially balanced court, concern for diversity should not compromise the ideal of meritocracy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s time for us to face the facts—all of Pakistan’s attempts at appeasing the Taliban have been a failure, and there’s no reason to expect any differently in the future.
The most recent concession came in February, when the Pakistani government accepted a peace agreement with Taliban elements active in its Swat Valley to allow Sharia law in the region. Predictably, the Taliban reneged on the agreement and encroached further on the nation’s capital, Islamabad. Another attempt to open negotiations on new terms earlier this month also failed. With such a record on its hands and the Taliban growing increasingly brazen in its maneuvers, the Pakistani government must reevaluate its policy. With the help of the international community, it can and should use all of its military resources to bring down the Taliban. 
While Pakistan does have some soldiers already in place, they are too few and inadequately organized. While it may be impractical for us to stretch our defense forces even more to send troops to Pakistan, U.S. intelligence resources and military advisers would drastically increase the effectiveness of the Pakistani army. The recent deployment of 24 U.S. military advisors to Pakistan to train the Pakistani military in counterinsurgency tactics is a good start. Promising proposed legislation in Congress also calls for $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan over the next five years to spur economic growth and development, with another $7.5 billion over the following five years. As Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, puts it himself, “I am thankful for the support that I got and thankful to the people of America to give their tax dollars to us. But I need more support.” 
The U.S. intelligence community can also actively work in the area by gathering information about the Taliban’s movements, targets, and tactics as well as recruiting allies against the Taliban. Promisingly, President Obama has continued the use of President Bush’s use of CIA covert operations and even increased them in some areas. The new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Leon Panetta, confirmed this in an interview, saying that the agency’s campaign against militants in Pakistan’s tribal areas was the “most effective weapon” the Obama administration had to combat al Qaeda’s top leadership.
These strategies will admittedly not come cheap. Though there are some ways to cut costs—implementing a World War II-style lend-lease act with the Pakistani government, for example, in which arms are provided for the purpose of combating the Taliban with the expectation that they will be returned—any international effort is bound to have significant costs. Illogical though it may seem to give foreign aid during a recession period, though, Americans should be prepared to contribute significant funds to Pakistan. Destroying the Taliban is an expensive investment now, but will yield large dividends in safety and stability in South Asia. Stability in the region benefits us by lessening the influence and power of extremist groups that are ardently anti-American.
The onus should not fall on the U.S. alone, however. One reason why Pakistan is hesitant to mobilize its army is due to fears of backlash from its bordering country, India. Tensions in Kashmir, simmering for decades, will not be resolved overnight. But considering the urgency of the crisis in Pakistan, a moratorium on troop deployment to the Kashmir region should be an immediate priority. Improbable as it is, the Indian government should supply some foreign aid to Pakistan to aid in its attempts at a change of policy.
Other countries can also lend a hand. In addition to helping provide the Pakistani military with money, arms, advising, and artillery, the international community could help with air strikes should Pakistan request them and mobilize an international coalition of troops to put down the insurgents. With limited economic capital, the international community should not entangle itself unnecessarily in wars. But the rare request in times of crisis from the Pakistani government should not fall on deaf ears.
All of these measures are crucial and should be put into motion immediately, for Pakistani national security is directly linked to the success of the democratization efforts in Pakistan and in the region. Negotiating with a group as radical as the Taliban is an exercise in futility—with a little help from its friends, the Pakistani government can and should continue mobilizing its military to take back the country for its citizens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are codependent on authority: We need authorities to underwrite our internships, write our recommendations, and evaluate our comp performance. An ambitious sociologist might even make the argument that Harvard students, so desperate to be in a position of power someday, are less than eager to constrain power’s reach today. Now, some students have proven far too eager to defend aspects of the administration’s proposals for economizing Harvard’s budget against student activists, who have allegedly engaged in what one writer on this page deemed “hyperbole, rudeness, and radicalism.”  
Everyone has the right to his or her opinion, but we ought to recognize that even a well-meaning Harvard administration is not a neutral arbitrator in this debate. In campus politics as in national politics, debate is necessary for shaping a satisfactory resolution.
While “Harvard is Rich: No Layoffs,” might seem an unconvincing oversimplification, efforts to force the administration to recognize layoffs as ruinous events in individual lives rather than mere statistics have a place in this debate. That those individuals may be recent immigrants with limited education makes it more urgent. A publicly traded company has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders—by law, it must care only about their good; a nonprofit organization has made a commitment to be run for the general social good. As such, the meaning of this goal is a matter for public, not private, debate, and having a valuable opinion on it does not, as was implied in a recent editorial, require full access to Harvard’s balance sheet.
Proposals for a nonprofit organization to trim its workforce in light of a recession are rightly controversial, even from economic point of view. In the Keynesian model, a recession can lead to a vicious circle of self-perpetuating cutbacks unless the government steps in to buttress demand. Under this logic, any actor claiming to act in the public interest (including but not limited to the government) ought to buy more goods (and labor) in a recession than a for-profit corporation under comparable constraints in order to maintain employment and demand levels.
Finally, well-meaning Harvard administrators—led as they are by a social historian—undoubtedly recognize that the future leaders who pass through this university will shape the institutions they go on to run after the institutions that raised them. One of President Drew G. Faust’s original, now quaint, initiatives was to inquire into why so many students were accepting unfulfilling jobs in the financial services industry after graduation. A case that students should instead follow their hearts and work to build a better society is inherently less convincing coming from a university that is run like an investment bank.
Students shouldn’t get the final say in Harvard’s decision-making process, but the thoughts of students, faculty, and staff have a place in making a case to administrators to look beyond a narrow view of the school’s objective. It seemed that the budget-cutting process would be closed to students, and it is heartening that two recent administration-student forums constitute an improvement in transparency compared to last month’s invitation-only town hall. This improvement is due in part to student activism at that event.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s assurances on May 3 that no “specific plans” for layoffs had then been made within FAS, and that students would have greater input in forthcoming aspects of the budgeting process, were heartening. But Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’s indication at the same forum that official student input in the process would primarily flow through already established committees ought to give some pause. These committees and their selection procedures may not be well-designed to express student interest in this moment of debate over core values—at a time when many more than the “usual suspects” have an interest in how student voices are expressed to the administration.
Today, Smith will make a major announcement about Harvard’s budgetary priorities for the next fiscal year, as well as the procedures to decide future budget cuts. While Smith has many concerns to address, I (and many others) would urge him to take the needs of Harvard’s lower-income workers into account. At an institution in which values such as diversity, sustainability, and public service—none of them “core” to Harvard’s educational mission—nonetheless inhabit the niche of respected priorities, where on the totem pole do we place the struggles of Harvard’s least fortunate?
For concerned students, the proper strategy in such a debate is not to trust the “appropriate authorities” to properly weigh interests against values through their own beneficent intelligence. If students don’t subscribe to a decision, the proper response is to shout our values from the rooftops. Indeed, facing a college administration that came of academic age in the sixties and seventies, little else but “radicalism” would suffice to convince such college functionaries that an opinion is indeed deeply held. It may ultimately be that some limited quantity of layoffs is a necessary evil in this economic storm, but at the richest university in the world, the “radical” and irresponsible thing would be to not make a stink about it.

As President Obama and Congress struggle to pass new energy legislation, we should remember that climate change is more than just an economic issue. It’s one of the most challenging moral and cultural dilemmas of our time. Any discussion of cutting emissions involves considerations about entitlement and responsibility on our no-longer-inexhaustible Earth.
On the surface, it appears we are suffering from the classic “Ec10” problem known as the tragedy of the commons: Certain people’s self-interest is destroying collective and open resources. But it’s not that simple. What action is self-interested and what’s not is hard to identify when prosperity—albeit unequal prosperity—has historically relied on the use of what was once thought to be an endless resource: the atmosphere. 
The fact is, the temperature is rising in our house, and not everyone is responsible for the heat wave to the same degree. Yet everyone must be involved in the solution. Furthermore, we cannot simply market-eer our way out of the maelstrom.
When discussing policy, both economic feasibility and a fair distribution of burdens should be considered as well as how a political action can imbue a spirit of collective responsibility and sacrifice for the environment. Hopefully large cap-and-trade schemes pass in Washington and the U.S. joins in at the U.N. Climate Conference in Copenhagen—grand-scale cap and trade is the best way to quickly reduce emissions. But we must be careful that the framework of any cap-and-trade scheme does not unfairly exonerate the responsibilities certain groups should have to face. More importantly, a cap-and-trade scheme must strengthen rather than harm communal obligation and aspiration.
The moral arguments against both cap-and-trade schemes are ubiquitous. A recent denunciation comes from Father Paul Mayer, co-founder of the Climate Crisis Coalition. Last month, he suggested that any continued pollution of the atmosphere is a sin: How can evil emitters be given the option of buying the right to sin from other groups—most likely struggling developing countries who bear little to no blame for the problem? Images of 16th-century Catholic indulgence policies come to mind. 
It’s difficult to see greenhouse-gas emissions as sins, especially since they are beneficial to the environment under a certain level. Still, Father Mayer’s overall point about escaping direct responsibility for actions that cause collective harm (even if they also bring common benefits) is an important one. His concern is most relevant in considering the distribution of international burdens.
Any cap-and-trade scheme must reflect the reality that developing countries have contributed little to climate change yet stand to be hurt the most. Unjustifiably, many in developed countries claim they should be allowed to emit more per capita than developing countries because their economy has grown to rely on emissions. It is one thing to not punish developed countries for a history of irresponsibility on the basis that they were ignorant of the harmful effects, and it is another thing to reward harmful behavior. Instead, as many other have proposed, emission credits should be pegged to U.N. population size estimates for 2050 and then traded. 
After the signing of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Michael Sandel infamously voiced a challenging concern for any cap-and-trade scheme. In a New York Times op-ed, Dr. Sandel wrote that cap-and-trade policies at any level would “undermine the ethic we should be trying to foster on the environment.” Many of Sandel’s claims in the piece regarding the economic infeasibility of a cap-and-trade scheme are weak, but the argument that cap and trade could hinder the needed spirit of collective responsibility is no joke. 
How would it appear if the U.S., the chief culprit of climate change, continued to emit and emit merely because it could financially afford to? It is a fact that the U.S. cannot trade away all of its emissions credits and will have to make cuts no matter what, but the point still stands. Although aggregate admissions rates would still fall, the sense of shared sacrifice would be lost. Sandel claims the commodification of emissions might remove the stigma associated with emissions. Paying for emissions could very well just become the price of doing business as usual. 
But does the ability to buy credits really make emissions more culturally acceptable? More importantly, does the cap-and-trade scheme raise more cultural awareness about the issue or less? It may be the case that, under a cap-and-trade scheme, emissions will become more stigmatized in light of the existence a common venture to defeat global warming, regardless of its reliance on cold market logic. There are arguments on both sides, and it ultimately depends on how cap and trade is sold to and bought by the people. If a cap-and-trade scheme is spun in the rhetoric of shared sacrifice, rather than merely increasing efficiency, it could be effective in cultivating a cultural change.
Cap-and-trade schemes can do much to mitigate the short-term effects of climate change. But it should be remembered that, although the most salient concern of the legislation in the U.S. is to quickly lower the aggregate amount of emissions with hurting the economy, this should not be the only concern. The moral and cultural dimensions of climate change must be also addressed. The only way up from the global fall from grace is to work together and consider what’s fair and important in the long run.

Americans’ concerns about catching the H1N1 swine flu have decreased substantially over the past week, though more people have been taking action to protect themselves, according to a Harvard School of Public Health survey released Friday.The survey, conducted by the Harvard Opinion Research Program at HSPH, is the first comprehensive nation-wide survey that polls the reactions, beliefs, level of alarm about the outbreak.Results were announced through the Center for Disease Control, which funds the survey, as part of the CDC’s daily update on swine flu.This is the second HSPH survey on Americans’ response to the outbreak. The first was released on May 1—just days after the first confirmed death from swine flu in the United States.The most recent survey found that about 60 percent of Americans are no longer concerned that the H1N1 flu will reach them or their immediate family in the next year, a 53 percent increase from last week’s poll.“There’s still uncertainty of what direction the swine flu could take,” said Robert J. Blendon, a professor at HSPH and director of the survey program. “But Americans are following the news closely, that’s for sure.”Of the populations surveyed, parents with children under 18 years old in school remain the most concerned. Half the parents reported not receiving any information from the schools regarding the steps they are taking to reduce the possible spread of the flu.According to Blendon, the survey aimed to gather information on how people respond to crisis so that public officials can be more effective. Knowing that nearly half of parents with young children in school are still concerned, school officials could relay more information about their responses to allay the parents’ fears, Blendon said.Though the survey showed an increase in awareness about the H1N1 flu, it also revealed several areas in which Americans still lacked knowledge.For example, many people were not aware of the CDC’s recent decision to change the name of the disease from “swine flu” to “H1N1 virus,” a third of Americans erroneously believed a vaccine against the virus is available, and a third were unaware that there are anti-viral drugs to treat the flu.The survey also found that more than half of Americans are taking action to lessen their chances of coming in contact with the virus. One in four people are avoiding air travel, and 12 percent have stopped hugging and kissing close friends and relatives.Though the survey revealed several notable trends, Blendon cautioned against drawing individual conclusions from the results.“Our expertise is to report what people are doing, not telling people what to do,” he said, adding that people should frequent the CDC website for the most up-to-date information on the flu.According to David S. Rosenthal ’59, director of Harvard University Health Services, the survey shows the power that mass media has to either spread panic or reduce concern.“It’s interesting to see how quickly people went from fear to a sort of relaxed mode,” said Rosenthal. He added that people “should not let their guard down” even though the flu outbreak has been less severe than anticipated.“[The flu] could come back more virulent in the fall,” Rosenthal said. “We’re not raising concerns yet, but we are being very observant.”—Staff Writer Helen X.

A student group leader who seeks medical assistance for an intoxicated or drug-impaired undergraduate will not face disciplinary charges from the College administration, according to the College’s revised amnesty policy, which was debuted at the Committee on House Life meeting last Thursday.But if the student leader hosting a social event fails to take an incapacitated student to University Health Services, he or she could still face disciplinary action.The policy’s new stipulations address student concerns with the former policy, specifically its “responsibility” clause, which stated that the hosts and executive leaders of a student club-sponsored party in which dangerous drinking occurs would face punishment if a party-goer seeks medical attention.Changing the rule on behalf of student leaders was a priority of the Undergraduate Council, said Tamar Holoshitz ’10, chair of the UC’s Student Affairs Committee. Last semester, student leaders approached the College administration concerned that student safety was being compromised, since they feared punitive measures for seeking medical attention. Both the UC and College administration empathized. “This proposal makes it clear that student group leaders are protected under the amnesty policy just as much as any other student,” Holoshitz said. “If it is something like hazing, then I think everyone would agree that we have the Ad Board for this reason.”In a Crimson interview last November, outgoing Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith H. Kidd recommended an “educational” component of a revised amnesty policy, a focus that is featured in the new policy. Student organization leaders are “urged” to take part in yearly “education efforts”—which may include lessons on risk reduction, event planning, and bartending—with the Office of Alcohol and other Drug Services and the Student Activities Office.“I think the revision is really important because the old policy created an environment in which social groups were hesitant to hold social events—which I think was problematic to college life,” UC president Andrea R. Flores ’10 said. “I’m happy that a lot of UC members worked to clarify it.”—Staff writer Ahmed N. Mabruk can be reached at amabruk@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Bita M.

The Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams are no strangers to the big stage, and when EARC Sprints come around, they expect to find themselves racing in the final heat.Needless to say, last year provided a shock for the Crimson’s first varsity eights when each boat missed its respective Grand Final at Easterns and had to settle for wrapping up their days in the petite final.This season, the Harvard crews reclaimed their places among the EARC’s best yesterday at Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester, Mass., winning their first heats by decisive margins to advance to the Grand Finals.“Last year was a disappointing season for the whole team,” lightweight captain Jeff Overington said. “This year was a complete 180-degree turnaround. We decided from Day 1 that we were going to turn things around this year.”Upon reaching the final heats, both first varsity boats faced stiff competition.The heavyweights found themselves in a fierce three-way battle with Wisconsin and Brown. While Harvard outpaced the Badgers by almost two seconds, its 5:42.625 finish was not enough to gain an edge over the Bears. Brown’s first boat gave its Crimson counterpart trouble in the crews’ first meeting of the season, finishing just a second behind Harvard in a dual meet. Yesterday, the Bears quickly erased an early Crimson lead and maintained its advantage to take first in 5:41.363.“There was good competition,” said heavyweight captain and second-varsity four seat Teddy Schreck. “We expected that. [The Bears] proved to be strong, especially towards the end of the race.”The first varsity lightweights turned in a similar performance to the heavies, rowing strongly but ultimately falling short to a familiar foe. Harvard blew past most of the field easily in the Grand Final, with its 5:43.990 showing beating third-place Georgetown by over four seconds. But Princeton, which had dealt the Crimson its only loss of the season on April 25, had Harvard’s number once again. The Tigers jumped out to an immediate lead, and while the Crimson stayed close and made a push around the 1000-meter mark, Princeton ultimately held on to win the race with a final time of 5:41.433.“It was disappointing to come in second place, but it’s a strong Princeton boat that won,” Overington said. “We raced well in the final.”While the varsity eight races headlined yesterday’s competition, Harvard displayed its depth as well, receiving solid performances from its other boats.The lightweights particularly turned in impressive results across the board, winning the Jope Cup by scoring 33 points on the day, two ahead of second-place finishers Yale and Princeton.The second varsity eight finished third in their race with a time of 5:59.002, trailing leader Yale by four seconds and second-place Navy by less than one tick.The lightweight 3V garnered the best results of any Crimson boat, dominating its race to dust runner-up Cornell by over three seconds with a 6:07.190 finish.“It was great to see the third boat win their race,” Overington said. “They had an awesome couple of weeks of training leading up to this. They executed their plan really well.”The first and second freshman lights turned in second and third place finishes, respectively.The heavyweights also notched 33 team points while contending for the Rowe Cup. Unfortunately for Harvard, Brown paced the field with 41 to take first.After easily winning its first heat, the second varsity eight faltered in the Grand Final, dropping down to fifth place and wrapping up the race almost 10 seconds behind first-place Brown at 5:56.657. The 3V came in at 6:03.246, good enough to take second, but was no match for an overwhelming Wisconsin boat that crossed the finish line at 5:57.455.“There are a lot of guys in the third and foruth boats that could easily step up in the first and second boats,” Schreck said. “It’s nice to have guys who can push each other all the time.”The freshman heavyweights also continued to show a competitive edge, with the first boat taking second while the second took third in its race.Both Harvard crews have ample time off to prepare themselves for the IRA National Championships, which begin on June 4 in Sacramento, Calif.—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field team traveled to Franklin Field in Philadelphia for the Outdoor Ivy League Championships, marking the culmination of its outdoor season. While the Heps doesn’t exactly have the same high-profile significance of the Penn Relays—held annually at the same site—the Crimson posted numerous exciting performances that would have arguably made any spectator believe that the most storied competition in track was being held last weekend.“[Franklin Field] wasn’t really full, but along the finishing straight-away, it was packed with all different teams. People were yelling and cheering. It was a great Ivy League bonding opportunity.”Six individual Ivy League titles were brought in on both sides, as the speed and strength of the Harvard athletes helped the men and women finish sixth and fourth, respectively, in competition. Overall, powerhouses Cornell and Princeton continued to dominate the Ivy League, with the Big Red finishing 1-2 in the men’s competition and the Tigers doing the same on the women’s side.“I was really pleased with the men and women’s team’s performances,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “[Our success] is a continuation of what we did in the indoor season. It’s great to see the women’s team consistently vie in the top half of the team and have a real chance to be in the top three.”The Crimson came out of the gates running on Saturday with impressive performances from rookies and seniors alike. And though the first day of competition was mostly preliminary rounds, Harvard still managed to bring home two individual championships.Leading the way was freshman sensation Nico Weiler, who won his first outdoor Heps championship in the pole vault by clearing 5.20 meters.“Nico had a great outdoor season. He really rebounded well after a somewhat disappointing Indoor Championship. He’s a great competitor and he has a tendency to rise up when the stakes are the highest.”Sophomore Jessica Fronk also had no problem taking care of her competition. After winning the Outdoor title last year, Fronk followed up with an encore by winning the javelin event once again with a toss of 43.31 meters.The Crimson continued its success the following day with four more great individual performances.In the highly competitive 5,000 meter run, sophomore Claire Richardson beat out three other Princeton competitors with a time of 16:43.10 to claim her first Heps title. In doing so, she also became the first Harvard runner to win the event since Suzanne Jones did it back in 1990.“Going in, my expectations were just to try to compete hard,” Richardson said. “That’s all you can do on any given day. Coach Saretsky is so good at telling me what to do in order to win. It was fun and it’s good to know that I got the most points for my team.”Senior Shannon Flahive had another outstanding Heps, winning the Heptathlon and becoming the first Crimson athlete to win the title since 1982.“Shannon was great. She’s just so consistent, and is such a good performer,” Richardson said.Flahive finished the event by winning the 100 hurdles and the 200 meter run. She earned 4940 points along the way, earning 186 more than the runner up.On the men’s side, junior Justin Grinstead blazed by his competition in the 400 meter hurdles, reaching the finish line with a time of 52.44 seconds. His victory marked another milestone for the track program, as Grinstead became the first Crimson man to win the event in over 24 years.“Justin had a great weekend,” Saretsky said. “It was great to see him become the dominant sprinter in the heat from start to finish.”Senior Becky Christensen terrorized Ivy League opponents one last time with her jaw-dropping athletic ability in the high jump. The All American won the event with a mark of 6’0’’ ½, joining just two other Ivy League competitors in history to win the event all four years.Strong individual performances such as these have given Saretsky and his staff plenty of optimism as the team finished the outdoor season with a strong statement to its competitors.“We had six individual Ivy League Champions,” Saretsky said. “I think that in itself is a great achievement. There were some really great performances from our youngsters. On such a young team, it bodes really well for the future.”—Staff writer Kevin T. Chen can be reached at ktchen@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This time of year is a busy time for most Harvard students as the year comes to a close.  For members of the Crimson’s women’s golf team, the weeks leading up to the end of the semester period are no different. With especially full schedules after missing school during their recent victory at the Ivy League Championships, the Harvard female golfers found time to practice a bit harder to come by recently than they probably would have liked.  The busy academic workload and limited practice time caught up to the team this past weekend, as the Crimson placed 19th out of a 21-team field at the NCAA Central Regional Championship in Columbus, Ohio, matching its performance from a year ago. “We definitely struggled this weekend,” junior Claire Sheldon said.  “I don’t think we struggled from a lack of preparation because we prepared as much and as best we could.  We just have not had that much time to practice recently.” Totaling the scores of its four best performers on each day, Harvard shot rounds of 318, 323, and 338 for the three-day affair on the par-72 course. Senior Emily Balmert led the Crimson’s efforts this past weekend at the tournament held on the Scarlet Course on the campus of The Ohio State University.  She shot rounds of six, seven, and eight over par, finishing with 11 pars on the final day of competition. “It was a tough weekend for us,” Balmert said.  “We did not play as well as we would have liked or probably as well as we could have based on our performances this year.  We are a little disappointed, but I don’t think this weekend can erase the strong year that we did have.” Sheldon had Harvard’s only birdie in the final round of the event.  She ended the day with a score of 87, while senior Ali Bode matched her with a score of 15 over par as well.  Freshman Christine Cho registered the Crimson’s second best total on Saturday, as she shot an 87, while sophomore Mia Kabasakalis finished with a round of 93. Harvard needed a top-eight finish in order to advance to Nationals, a feat that the Crimson felt was indeed attainable with a great performance this weekend. “We were hoping things would come together this weekend, and we would do something special,” Sheldon said.  “While top eight may have been a bit ambitious, I think it was a good goal for Harvard to have.” The second-ranked Bruins of UCLA won the tournament by 19 strokes over the Boilermakers of Purdue. Despite the struggles this weekend, the Crimson believes it is headed in the right direction for next year, as it attempts to stay atop the Ivy League for a third consecutive year. “The team has gotten stronger every year over the past four years,” Balmert said.  “We have amazing depth, as you could take any five of us to any tournament and get a similar result.  That type of team can withstand the test of time, and our recruits next year will be great additions.” Sheldon echoed the graduating Balmert’s words on what to takeaway from the regional tournament this weekend. “This was our second time at this regional tournament, and I feel it can act as a huge learning experience for us,” Sheldon said.  “We can gain a great message from this event, and while it will be tough to recover next year with the three seniors that we lose, I feel next year has the chance to be a really fun year for us.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

If you hit up a House formal sometime this week, chances are the person you have to thank for playing "Low" right when you want to dance with that girl in the short red dress is none other than Harvard's current DJ of the moment, DJ Straus.
DJ Straus, otherwise known as George Zisiadis '11, has been DJing for a year and a half and has played about a dozen gigs since beginning to DJ at Harvard earlier this semester. 
Straus, who provided musical enjoyment for the attendees of the Lowell, Leverett, and Cabot/Pfoho formals was also originally planning to play the Mather formal last night, but the gig seems to have fallen through at the last minute. The reason, after the jump.
According to his blog, "it wasn't clear to some that booking a DJ Straus performance doesn't involve micromanaging the music playlist."  Sounds like a bit of a "creative control" tussle.
But never fear if you're a Matherite saddened by DJ Straus's absence. In addition to navigating the Harvard party circuit better than an FC girl, each month the Adams House resident puts up a new "Straus Mix" on his website, a compilation of what he said are "only the best songs that I think have shown up in the last month."
This month's mix contains everything from R.E.M. (we know them) to DJ Ghadi Tha Great (no idea).
"The goal of these mixes and the parties is to raise people's musical standards here at Harvard, and give them a musical experience they can gain value from," said Zisiadis.  Lofty words.

With approximately 1600 people in your class, it must say something when you're deemed one of the 15 hottest freshmen. We applaud you, you fresh-faced and virile youngsters. We look forward to seeing what three more years at this place will do to your physiques and states of mind.
With that sober introduction, check out some of our favorite moments (and more pictures of beautiful people!) below:
Jonathan R. Mason's best trait is not any old smile. It's this one: ;-)
More glamor after the jump.
Elizabeth C. Ahern's favorite thing about being a sophomore: "Punch events!" No shame, this one.
Crystal Y. Coser loves her "booty." Maybe this is the wrong picture, then?
Christophe A.T. Van (of "Mr. Asian Sensation" fame, if you recall) likes to describe himself with adverbs. We think that's what adjectives are for, Christophe, but hey, NBD.
Adam B. Vartikar will marry you for your money.
Check out the rest of the hottest freshmen online! Also, for the lascivious and lovelorn amongst you: Dunster Dining Hall and Adams House got some serious shout-outs, and it looks as though most of these freshmen are single, so if you find yourself lonely and heartbroken this fall, make sure to head over to those two places to snatch up some (hopefully still) single sexy sophomores.
