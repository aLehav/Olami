After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looks like the characters of “Riverdale” celebrated Thanksgiving early, and as anyone could have guessed, no one got a quiet, relaxing dinner with their family. Instead, there were guns drawn, rum bottles broken, and murder plots partially unravelled. The plot holes that riddled “The Ice Storm” this week unfortunately overshadowed some of the sweeter, more nostalgic moments of the episode.
For one, Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos) announced his run for mayor just two episodes ago and because he ran unopposed, apparently he’s just automatically mayor. When Sheriff Jones (Skeet Ulrich) admits to Archie (KJ Apa) that Hiram told him to shut down the community center’s Thanksgiving, Jones explains, “He’s mayor now. He can do anything.” Either Riverdale goes by its own rules, or the writers of the show are blissfully unaware of how government in the real world works.
After Veronica (Camila Mendes) rips the tablecloth out from under her family’s expensive Thanksgiving meal — she’s mad about all the murdering, backstabbing, and the recent betrayal of her boyfriend — she uses her ever-expanding checkbook to buy fancy Thanksgiving food for Archie’s community dinner. Unfortunately Dodger’s mother, Darla (Azura Skye), shows up to avenge her son, who has been put in a coma after being attacked. What ensues is unpleasant: Darla draws her gun after a kid makes a grab for it during dinner and points it at Archie execution-style, insisting he confess to hurting Dodger (Juan Riedinger) despite Archie’s innocence. Then the kids at the dinner stand up and confess in rapid succession in what feels like a blatant rip-off of the “O Captain, my Captain” scene from “Dead Poets Society.” Darla even throws around some fighting words: “You know what I think, carrot top? I think you’ve got a hero complex.” While she isn’t wrong, it seems extreme to shoot him for this. Luckily the turkey fryer explodes and Archie’s mom gets her hands on a gun. It’s just not Thanksgiving without Molly Ringwald wielding a firearm!
Meanwhile, Betty (Lili Reinhart) travels to Stonewall Prep to spend Thanksgiving break with Jughead (Cole Sprouse). It’s pretty illogical for Betty to travel in an ice storm to the abandoned boarding school (why is this even allowed, actually?) when Jughead could just come home to his family. After all, Jughead and Betty’s parents live together in the same house now! And once the steamy reunion scene is over, Jughead ventures to the vending machine for some dinner only to find they’re not alone! Bret (Sean Depner) and Donna (Sarah Desjardins) are there in bunny masks holding axes. Luckily, it’s some weird prank, but Betty can’t help herself and is convinced there’s foul play. After an extremely-unsubtle game of “Never Have I Ever,” Betty breaks into Donna’s room and finds Mr. Chipping’s (Sam Witwer) tie pin — which is a bit suspicious because Mr. Chipping jumped out of a window during class just last week.
Eventually, Donna confesses to Betty that she was having an affair with Mr. Chipping, but she threatened to break it off just a day before he jumped. While Jughead is convinced and feels awful for Donna, Betty isn’t so sure. Now “Riverdale” writers have added an unsavory twist, in which viewers are not sure whether they should trust a student’s word that she was abused by a teacher.
But by far the most bizarre storyline, as always, is the nonsense that happens at Thistlewood. Cheryl (Madeline Petsch) has truly lost it. Last week Cheryl and Toni (Vanessa Morgan) killed Cheryl’s uncle, but unfortunately couldn’t dump his body in the river because Cheryl’s aunt is staking them out. Cheryl invites her aunt to Thanksgiving dinner, where she convinces her that the meat pie she was just served is actually her dead husband. When her aunt doesn’t believe her at first, Cheryl says, “We Blossoms have always been highly carnivorous. I mean, I ate my brother in the womb.” Cheryl’s aunt runs out in horror. So, all in all, a pretty standard Thanksgiving.
This episode does absolutely nothing for the overall plot of the season, which is perhaps fair because it is a holiday episode. Though the writers tried to put in some feel-good family moments and shout outs to the late Luke Perry, the episode is overshadowed by the unconventional — and nonsensical — events that take place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Americans should care about race in our country.” Who knew the key to racial change in America was so easy? In “Meaning Train,” Carrie Cunningham ’93 proposes that her collection of short essays on religion and politics will create a “nonviolent and good moral compass humans can embrace to make the world a better place.” But with oversimplified resolutions and extraordinarily brief remarks, Cunningham’s agglomerated essays more closely resemble an annotated bibliography than the intricate book she claims to write.
The essays that make up “Meaning Train” are short and only loosely related to each other within five parts: Race, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Ecumenism and America. In “Part 1: Race,” Cunningham begins by explaining how Abraham Lincoln helped make America what it is today — “a place of promise and hope… that elected Obama its first black president.” In actuality, Cunningham doesn’t explain at all; instead, she details how Doris Kearns Goodwin how Lincoln changed America in the book “Team of Rivals.” Her extrapolation of Lincoln’s significance in Obama’s election seems distant from the substance of her essay, but these unrelated conclusions become common throughout “Meaning Train.” Rather than use paragraphs to back an argument, Cunningham summarizes a book, person, or interview before jumping to an unbacked solution of something that “should” be: “We should advocate for measures that will help people, not divide them”; “We should center our aid on giving love and hope for the helpless”; “We should all exhibit grace to Native Americans.” Rather than create a moral foundation, these prescriptive statements grossly oversimplify current issues in contemporary media and come across as distant from reality.
Cunningham’s style is consistent from cover to cover: She tends to open with a broad moral statement, then introduce a figure or book that exemplifies the statement. The simple structure feeds the oversimplification of the issues regarded in the book. But even more so, it undermines Cunningham’s goal of weaving together ideas of race, religion, and politics. A compilation of essays should build on each other. Instead, this collection lacks synthesis and each essay offers its own ideas, and the realms of religion, race, and politics rarely intersect in any meaningful way.
The true tragedy of “Meaning Train” is that it fails to give meaning to anything. Broad ideas of what the world should be doing better are more likely to take away meaning than provide it without a direction for action. Cunningham provides no effective direction to create change, which seems to be a critical void when the book is intended to be a foundation to make the world a better place.
Even so, what little value the essays have comes from the books and people Cunningham references. Her summaries are as effective as they are brief, but this might give “Meaning Train” a purpose of pointing readers toward a better choice of literature. The intended audience is altogether unclear throughout. Because of the simple structure and broad claims, it is hard to identify any reader who would benefit from “Meaning Train.” Cunningham’s use of overly technical vocabulary makes the essays less available to younger and less educated readers, while also failing to introduce new ideas in the realm of social justice. As a progressive Christian, Cunningham speaks on general ideas of faith and Christianity, but fails to uproot much theological meaning, skirting on the outside of valuable spiritual literature. “Meaning Train” may best be suited to introduce topics of social justice, but in 2019, there is a host of better options.
While “Meaning Train” adds little value to today’s social context, Cunningham has perhaps set her own moral compass for writing on social change in the future. There is a breadth of topics that Cuningham may be more successful pursuing individually, and hopefully with a stronger evaluative voice of her own. However, that is all to come; for now, “Meaning Train” can wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 27, 2019 at 12:51 a.m.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an email to University affiliates Tuesday that Harvard’s graduate student union’s planned strike will neither “clarify” either side’s position nor “resolve areas of disagreement.”
The email comes as the two sides hold their final scheduled bargaining session before the strike deadline on Dec. 3. Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers announced their plans earlier this month to go on strike if a contract is not reached. A bargaining session last Friday failed to resolve any of the core issues that have deadlocked the negotiations, including compensation, health benefits, and a procedure to resolve sexual harassment and discrimination claims.
Garber — the top administrator overseeing negotiations — detailed the University’s positions on several of these issues in the email, also noting that Harvard’s full proposals have been posted online, as have several HGSU proposals.
HGSU did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
Garber wrote that the current negotiation timeline is consistent with first contract bargaining between universities and graduate student unions across the country.
“The fact that we are still meeting 13 months after negotiations began is not due to a lack of good faith by the HGSU-UAW or the University, but is rather a reflection of the complexity of negotiating a first contract with such a large and diverse union,” Garber wrote. “At other universities, first contracts with graduate student worker unions have taken 12-18 months.”
Garber also noted that the University’s benefits and compensation proposals on the table “compare well” with other peer institutions, and that Harvard’s proposal would constitute a seven percent increase in pay for teaching fellows over three years, and an eight percent jump for research assistants.
In response to the union’s proposals on healthcare, the University has proposed creating pool funds to support union members’ health insurance and dental health plan premium payments, as well as child care.
“The proposed financial assistance funds are greater than those found in comparable union contracts at other universities and add to the benefits already provided to Harvard students,” Garber wrote.
HGSU, on the other hand, has called for greater annual compensation increases for its members. According to their most recent proposal posted to their website, they are seeking an annual payment increase of 4.25 percent on top of a first-year salary increase of 8 percent more than current pay rates for research assistants. They have proposed a 5 percent annual increase for salaried teaching fellows. The union has also called for complete full health, mental health, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage for all eligible members and their dependents.
Another issue of contention has been the union’s proposal for handling claims of sexual harassment and discrimination. The union has argued that student workers should be given an option to raise such complaints through a union grievance procedure — a dispute resolution mechanism outside of current internal Harvard channels, and one that could eventually lead to third-party arbitration.
Garber wrote in his email that the University believes the union’s proposal is “inconsistent” with the University’s legal obligations under Title IX.
“Federal Title IX regulations require that the University provide an equitable process and that trained investigators conduct investigations,” Garber wrote. “A labor arbitration is not an investigation, nor is an arbitrator an investigator. Rather, labor arbitration is an adversarial process between an employer and a union to settle potential contract violations.”
Garber also noted the University’s concerns that the union has proposed the right to open grades and academic assessments to grievance procedures if the union member feels it was “retaliatory in nature.” He wrote that he does not believe an arbitrator would be able to sufficiently make judgments on academic matters.
As soon as the union announced its strike authorization vote in October, administrators began to urge faculty to prepare for the potential impact of the strike. According to Garber’s email, departments across the University have started to implement “contingency plans” for the impending strike.
“Faculty (and staff) are free to support the union’s goals, but they also must fulfill their academic responsibilities to their students, just as students must fulfill their academic requirements and continue to make progress toward their degrees,” Garber wrote.
In his email, Garber wrote that those who do not work should not expect to be paid, and that departments will have to continue tracking workers’ hours in order to comply with federal grant rules.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a separate email to undergraduates and their parents Tuesday afternoon that the College is taking steps to “minimize any negative impact” on students’ coursework and research.
“In the event of a strike on or after December 3, your course leaders will communicate directly with you about any changes to courses or other academic activities,” Khurana wrote.
Khurana wrote that though each student is responsible for fulfilling their academic obligations, the College respects all perspectives on the strike.
“While HGSU-UAW members have the right to strike, student workers who are striking should be in touch with their faculty members and their advisors,” Khurana wrote. “Students who are not members of the HGSU-UAW also have a right to decide how they may choose to support the strike.”
Roughly 450 to 500 undergraduates who work as teaching staff are members of HGSU.
Garber and Khurana’s emails followed one sent by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay to faculty and staff. In the email, Gay highlighted the preparations being taken to prevent the strike from disrupting the “academic progress of our students.”
Gay wrote that the Office of Undergraduate Educatation has been working with Directors of Undergraduate Studies and Department Administrators to create guidance for faculty on a variety of issues that could come up during a strike. Her email specifically contained a link to guidance for tracking grant-funded research during the strike, and referenced several other FAQs to address different teaching activities expected to be impacted during the strike.
“Among the topics they have addressed are exam proctoring, grading for large courses, grading for junior tutorials and other special courses, and protocols for asking your teaching staff if they will be teaching once the strike is underway,” Gay wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty people were arrested — including 11 Harvard students and alumni and at least 19  Yale students and alumni — after hundreds of people stormed the field during the 136th edition of The Game Saturday.
The New Haven Police Department announced in a press release that the divestment protesters will appear at New Haven Superior Court Dec. 6.
Initially, dozens of protesters ran onto the field roughly three minutes before halftime ended and displayed banners calling for divestment. Minutes later, several hundred spectators joined the protesters’ sit-in and chanted “Divest.”
The demonstration continued for roughly half an hour in the center of the field until several protesters returned to the stands and police officers arrested those who insisted they would not leave. Forty-eight students — including all Harvard students arrested — were charged with disorderly conduct and given a misdemeanor summons. The protestors continued their chants off the football field near an entrance gate to the stadium.
For nearly a decade, Harvard students, alumni, and faculty have called on the Harvard administration to divest the school’s endowment holdings from fossil fuels — organizing rallies, meeting directly with administrators, and even blockading the entrance of Massachusetts Hall to protest for divestment.
Despite these efforts, several University presidents, including current University President Lawrence S. Bacow, have long rejected divestment and maintained that the endowment should not be used as a tool for political change.
Two of the arrests — neither of which involved Harvard students — were custodial arrests, which were processed at Union Avenue Detention Facility in New Haven, Conn. One of the custodial arrests involved disorderly conduct and first-degree trespassing. The other arrest involved disorderly conduct, first degree criminal trespassing, and interfering with the police, according to the press release.
Divest Harvard declined to comment on the arrests.
Fossil Free Yale, a co-organizer of the protest, announced on Twitter Saturday that they are raising money to cover the legal fees for arrested protesters. They currently set a goal of $20,000. As of Tuesday morning, they had raised more than $13,000.
According to their GoFundMe page, the maximum fine for disorderly conduct is $500. They wrote that they plan to use the money to also help Harvard students attend their court date in New Haven.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Tuesday that 15 professors will serve on an advisory committee to help select the next dean of Harvard Business School.
Current Business School Dean Nitin Nohria announced earlier this month that he would step down at the end of the academic year after a decade as dean. He is set to officially leave office on June 30.
Bacow and Garber announced the creation of the advisory committee in an email to University affiliates Tuesday afternoon. The group includes faculty from the Business School’s 10 academic units that comprise its primary fields of study. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay will also serve on the committee.
Nohria has been praised by colleagues for his leadership, his focus on diversity at the Business School, and his close relationships with faculty and students.
In the email, Bacow and Garber wrote that Nohria had completed a “decade of extraordinary leadership.”
Bacow and Garber also wrote that they encourage, students, alumni, faculty and staff to provide feedback during the search process.
“We particularly welcome your observations on the principal opportunities and challenges facing HBS in the years to come, on the qualities and experience most important to seek in the next dean, and on any individuals you regard as worthy of serious consideration,” they wrote.
The members of the search committee are Business School professor Dennis W. Campbell, Business School professor Rohit Deshpandé, Business School professor Robin J. Ely, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, Business School professor Francesca Gino, Business School Senior Associate Dean for Culture and Community Janice Hammond, Business School Professor Rebecca Henderson, Kennedy School and Business School professor Herman “Dutch” B.

A group of Harvard faculty will formally propose that the Harvard Corporation divest the University’s $40.9 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies, according to documents shared with members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday afternoon.
English professor Nicholas J. Watson will present the proposal — which was written by 11 FAS professors — at the FAS’s monthly meeting Dec. 3, according to the agenda for the meeting. In a white paper released to FAS faculty along with the agenda, the 11 professors call on the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to use divestment as a tool to reject the “ethically abhorrent behavior” of fossil fuel companies and address an “urgent need for change” to help combat the global climate crisis.
“The Corporation should instruct the Harvard Management Company to withdraw from, and henceforth not pursue, investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels, or in companies that provide direct support for such exploration and development,” the agenda reads.
The faculty members also call for the Corporation to ensure that any HMC investment adviser “unwilling or unable to comply is replaced by one who is willing to carry out these instructions,” adding in the white paper that they demand “bold, decisive action” from Harvard as a leader in higher education.
“Harvard has primarily approached the climate crisis from a mainstream, business-as-usual, incrementalist approach. It is time for that to change: as the wealthiest university in the world, Harvard should take a much more ambitious ethical lead,” the paper reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the white paper.
The meeting agenda states that because the divestment proposal is “substantive,” Watson will present it for discussion only, rather than putting it up to a vote by the faculty. Watson wrote in an email that he and the other authors of the white paper hope the proposal will be voted upon at the following Faculty meeting, which is scheduled for Feb. 4.
In a survey of FAS faculty administered by The Crimson in May 2018, 67 percent of respondents indicated they support fossil fuel divestment. In December, a group of Harvard professors using the name “Harvard Faculty for Divestment” vowed to issue a “renewed call” for divestment; since then, more than 390 faculty have signed a petition by the group.
Such increasingly vocal calls for divestment have come as student activism around the issue has ramped up: Last weekend, 11 Harvard students and alumni were arrested after hundreds of people stormed the field at the Harvard-Yale football game, displaying banners and shouting chants in support of divestment.
At last month’s Faculty meeting, FAS professors debated the merits of divestment to a packed room of more than 200 faculty members and guests. Five faculty offered impassioned support for the strategy, while three others argued that alternative measures — like increased support for teaching and research related to climate change — would be more appropriate ways for the University to use its power to effect change.
Though they write that divestment would be “single most effective example of civic leadership that Harvard could take,” the 11 faculty who wrote the white paper also included roughly two dozen other suggestions for Harvard to combat climate change, spanning categories including teaching, research, and public outreach.
For instance, they suggest creating robust new curriculum around climate and the environment, including new General Education courses and a “Hum 10-style” colloquium on the environment. They also ask that the University alter its tenure processes to be “more accommodating of solutions-based interdisciplinary research,” in an attempt to empower junior faculty to study “problems of immediate relevance.”
The faculty wrote that a “crucial first step” to implementing all of their suggestions would be for Harvard to undertake a “high-profile fundraising campaign” to finance the new climate efforts.
“Harvard’s statement of its intention to divest will be all the more powerful if presented as one essential part of a comprehensive, ambitious leadership agenda,” the white paper reads. “Here we begin the conversation about what such an agenda should contain.”
The faculty who authored the white paper include Watson, History professor Joyce E. Chaplin, Astronomy professor Charles Conroy, English professor James Engell, Romance Languages and Literatures professor Virginie Greene, Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, Economics professor Stephen A. Marglin, History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes, Harvard Medical School professor Caren Solomon, Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, and History professor Kirsten A. Weld.

Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 announced plans to develop a new seal for the Law School in an email to students on Tuesday.
In 2016, Harvard Law School retired its former seal following historical research that revealed it has ties to slavery.
“As many of you know, HLS retired its former shield in 2016 after historical research revealed that Isaac Royall, Jr., on whose family crest the shield was based following a bequest to Harvard College in 1781, earned his wealth through the labor of enslaved people,” Manning wrote.
Prior to the seal’s removal, it featured three sheaves of wheat and adorned the school’s doors, chairs, apparel, letterheads, web pages, social media avatars, and the banners that typically served as the backdrop to each graduating class’ commencement ceremony.
In the spring of 2016, the law school replaced the Royall crests with a crimson seal with “Harvard Law” written in bold across the front.
Manning wrote that the new seal will need to fit within Harvard’s current suite of seals.
“Working in conjunction with the University and the Harvard Corporation, we will move forward with the proposal of a new shield that fits within Harvard’s suite of shields and that represents the broad aspirations of Harvard Law School,” he wrote.
Law School and History professor Annette Gordon-Reed will serve as the chair of the working group tasked with developing the new seal. Associate Dean for Strategic Initiatives Jessica L. Soban ’02 will serve as the project manager.
The working group will comprise faculty, staff, alumni, and two current students. Currently, the group consists of Director of Facilities and Operations John Arciprete, Law School professor I. Glenn Cohen, Harvard Law School Association President Daniel E. Eaton, Associate Dean for Communications and Public Affairs Melodie L. Jackson, and Staff Attorney with the American Civil Liberty Union’s Racial Justice Program Amreeta S. Mathai.
Two Law School students will also be chosen to join the working group, and interested students are invited to submit an online application to the Dean of Students Office by Dec. 23.
Manning wrote in his email that the process will benefit from the creativity of the Law School.
“This process will benefit greatly from the thoughtful and creative input of the HLS community,” Manning wrote. “As such, the Working Group will create a number of opportunities for community members to share their ideas and perspectives, and I want to thank you in advance for your input.”

Harvard’s graduate student union and the University agreed Tuesday to schedule one additional bargaining session for Dec. 2, one day before the union’s looming Dec. 3 strike deadline, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers is set to go on strike if a contract agreement is not reached after the next bargaining session. In the event of a strike, student teaching staff could choose to halt their paid instructional work, including holding sections and office hours and grading assignments and exams. Graduate research assistants on strike would withhold 20 hours of their paid research work not related to their academic program.
The additional negotiating date was confirmed during a bargaining session Tuesday, which was originally scheduled to be the final session before the deadline. During Tuesday’s session, the union and the University exchanged counterproposals, but were unable to reach any new tentative agreements, according to Swain.
The union did not respond to a request for comment.
Following Tuesday’s session, the union sent an “official strike notice” and guidelines for action during the strike to members.
According to the guidelines, striking union members will turn over grade books, papers, and all other materials for courses they teach at 10 a.m. on Dec. 3 and proceed to “strike headquarters” at the Phillips Brooks House in Harvard Yard.
From there, the union members will proceed to picket lines or conduct other related duties. The strike is planned to continue indefinitely until a contract is reached.
“Strikers take on a variety of duties during the strike to ensure its success,” the guidance reads. “We recommend that every striker spend 10 hours at the picket line or on other strike duty per week.”
Picket lines in Cambridge will be held each day from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. “until further notice,” and picket lines on Harvard’s Longwood campus will run from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. each day, according to the guidelines. The picket locations will be “variable” and not announced ahead of time.
During the strike, HGSU members can continue their “academic work as normal” in their typical place of work, and picket lines will be “porous” to accommodate this, according to union’s guidance.
The guidelines note that striking workers who lose pay are eligible to access a strike fund, though they must work an average of four hours of strike duty per week to qualify.
In Tuesday’s session, the University offered counterproposals on provisions regarding employee appointment letters, union access and rights, a no-strike policy, discipline and discharge, and workload, according to Swain.
The University also separated a provision on academic retaliation from the discipline and discharge provision.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates Tuesday afternoon, University Provost Alan M. Garber highlighted his concerns with the union’s academic retaliation proposal, which would give union members the right to file complaints over grades and academic assessments through the union grievance procedure. Garber wrote that he does not believe arbitrators would have the “expertise” needed to make judgements on academic matters.
HGSU and the University remain at loggerheads over economic proposals on compensation and health benefits, and noneconomic proposals such as the grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
In a bargaining session last Friday, the union presented an updated compensation proposal with a lower annual wage increase than it previously asked for. The University also increased the amount of money it pledged for funds dedicated to health, dental, and child care. No agreement on compensation and health care was reached in the session.
