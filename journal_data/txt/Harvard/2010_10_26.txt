After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Toward the middle of “Trust,” this year’s Visiting Director’s Project on the Loeb Mainstage, a character analyzes the dating world. How can it be that he never gets the girl, even when he tries so hard? He paces and muses, and finally comes to this explanation: “It’s not a jungle out there. A jungle—no problem—you bring a guide, some bug spray, and a big gun. But, this is way more than a jungle. This is a mystery.”
The line gets right to the core of what makes “Trust,” directed by Scott Zigler and running through October 30, such a frustrating show to watch. The play has great ideas about love and friendships, and is willing to explore them big-heartedly on stage. But it just doesn’t have the words to say what it wants to. While well-acted and cohesively directed, “Trust” cannot overcome the hurdle of its writing.
At the center of the play’s ever-evolving relationships are Cody Brown and Becca, a couple engaged to be married. Cody (the suave Paris K. Ellsworth ’14) is a rising musician with a slick demeanor. Becca (Kelly E. Perron ’11), by contrast, is uncertain and flighty. Her discomfort with her surroundings is usually expressed by the nervous habit of running her hands through her hair. “She is clawing at the hair, nails grazing her scalp,” comments another character narrating the scene.
Around them flit a host of coarsely-drawn personas whose desires shift seemingly at random. Gretchen (Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11) starts out as Becca’s wedding dressmaker, reluctantly becomes her friend, and then unexpectedly ends up her lover. Holly (the exuberant Emily B. Hyman ’13) toys with the men around her as if to prove her own understanding of their psyche. “I’m doing it. Being a little shit,” she frequently apologizes proudly. These relationships often seem forced, which is perhaps partly a product of the play’s constraints; only with such a small cast would such recently-made acquaintances become the staple of a wedding shower.
Still, strong acting enlivens even these flat characters. As Leah, a washed-up singer destroyed by the “agents and babes” of musical fame, Isabel Q. Carey ’12 is smooth and confident. It’s not hard to imagine why so many other characters are seduced by her; she carries herself with particular poise. Her occasional moments of forced perspicuity about the music industry—“They want you to be an asshole,” she says—may come across as grating, but Carey is an able actress and is not overwhelmed by the heavy language.
Ryan P. Halprin ’12 is funny as Roy, a public radio announcer who has no luck with girls. His monologue about dating frustrations is the play’s most engaging scene. As he explains his anxieties about women, he pulls out the results of a day’s nervous shoplifting—a long plastic hose, a skateboard. The sequence has a particularly sketch-like humor. “Whenever I get nervous about women, I drink any beer but Coors, and I steal,” is a joke one could imagine in a 1990s television show.
This is a sensibility that is carried throughout the play. The set, designed by Jessica X. Zuo ’13, evokes the set-up of a sitcom. A carefully-crafted bridge in the back of the stage is partly obscured by large images of buildings—the same austere apartment complexes that characterize a city comedy like “Seinfeld” or “Friends.” A couch is placed in the back, and characters occasionally sit there between scenes, as if watching the drama from the comfort of their own living room. These references are unfortunately never picked up or played upon, though. Zigler meekly leaves his characters in the vacuum of their own relationships.
The play is all the more disappointing because its ideas aren’t completely off the chart. Zigler was right when he told The Crimson last week, “It’s about a lot of things that the students are going to face after graduation.” But even the best actors can’t make platitudes like “Every kiss is a betrayal” and “I lost sight of where she began and where I stopped” carry the weight with which they are intended. It is a jungle out there, or maybe it’s just a mystery, but what’s needed isn’t bug spray and a gun—it’s subtlety.

Open any of the email promotions sitting in your inbox, flip through any of the standard fashion magazines from Vogue to V, or scroll through any of the seemingly never-ending fashion blogs available, and you’ll be inundated with the same hollow phrases—“absolutely gorgeous,” “perfectly tailored,” “just stunning,” “brilliantly simple,” “effortlessly chic,” etc. For how cutthroat the fashion world is portrayed to be, it’s also strangely and irritatingly positivist. Negative criticism is largely non-existent; I’m not talking about the criticism that stems from outsider media grumbling about high fashion’s extravagant prices and outrageous antics, but constructive and substantiated criticism as discussed by an informed critic. The industry’s refusal to engage in such a discourse only hinders it, confirming the sweeping generalization and public perception of fashion as being a trivial and superficial practice.
Glance at the table of contents of such a magazine and there are trend reports, a showcase of a few looks from the newest season, styling advice, advertisements, beauty product pages, party pictures of people wearing the described clothing, features on charity/art/travel/food, contact information of large distributors, etc. This is not a forum for discussion of high fashion on its own merits, but an endorsement machine—magazines serve to encourage people to spend money, as can best be seen in Vogue’s sponsored Fashion’s Night Out in September and upcoming Fashion’s Night In, events promoting in-store and online shopping
Cathy Horyn, the New York Times fashion critic, is an exception to this monotonous sugarcoating of fashion writing, penning strong criticism of the industry. In return, she has been largely attacked—designers Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana, Helmut Lang, and others have barred her from shows (a tactic rarely, if ever, found in the performing or visual arts). This refusal to recognize the importance of writing like Horyn’s delimits fashion to fluff.
Recently, criticism has surfaced, but in the form of satire; the blog “The Man Repeller” and online-only DIS Magazine, a pun on the prefix ‘dis’ (as in discover, distaste, and dystopia), are capable of saying what seemingly cannot be said in more traditional realms. “The Man Repeller,” started by Leandra Medine, is her colorful confessional of why all her on-trend clothing from jodphurs to double denim is far from concerned with flattering the body and thus far from helping her love life—hence, the title. Medine does not criticize fashion the way Horyn does, but does highlight the most ridiculous and outrageous aspects of the industry, positing the questions of what exactly high fashion’s aims are and what the criteria is to judge collections. However, because Medine discusses the industry from this humorous perspective and is a participant in the sometimes esoteric culture, her blog is not rejected or alienated by the industry like Horyn’s writing is. Instead, its steadily garnering attention in magazines.
DIS Magazine takes a more scathing approach than Medine, posting “photo editorials” of individuals sporting orthopedic devices as the new “It Accessory” and women photoshopped with the trademark Balmain sharp elongated shoulders. DIS is neither a blog nor a website emulating the issue organization of a magazine; its format extends into multiple mediums—photo editorials, videos, music, animations, and text. This approach eschews the constraints and conventions—personal blogs that read like a laundry list of clichés (“Fashion is an art form” apparently never gets old); fashion websites that are a constant stream of the trend reports and celebrity profiles; magazines that are reduced to cheerleading. Instead of the positivist norm of the industry, DIS operates almost solely in the negative. With this construction, it occupies a novel position. It is not a blog aggregator taking a runway look out of context and ridiculing its impracticality, nor is it anti-fashion, but defining itself as an antithesis to the industry as it exists. In a way, DIS does what Horyn and critics in fashion cannot from more “legitimate” positions. Yet, DIS cannot fit in the industry either because it’s founded as a dystopia, or as it states, “DIS is a dissection of fashion, art and commerce which seeks to dissolve conventions, distort realities, disturb ideologies and disrupt the dismal dissemination of fashion discourse.”
If high fashion wants to be taken more seriously than a superficial adornment of the body, then it should allow writing to treat it as such and self-perceived antidotes like DIS will be no more.

It is a rare opportunity to be able to peek inside the lives of people in different times and on different continents, and to feel an ardent connection to their desires and problems. This, however, is exactly what Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer offers in her collection of short stories, “Life Times.” In 38 pieces written between 1952 and 2007, Gordimer explores the full range of human emotion through tales of love and intimacy; of survival and segregation.
Underlying the majority of the stories in “Life Times” is a sense of importance of location; almost every one either takes place in or makes mention of Johannesburg, South Africa. Racial tension plays a significant role in her stories as she draws upon the history of the area. The presence of this conflict is subtly hidden in some stories and more blatant in others. It is especially evident in a story entitled “Six Feet of the Country,” in which a white man is faced with the burden of dealing with the local authorities when the body of the deceased brother of his black worker is misplaced. The man describes the discomfort he feels in facing his worker: “He just kept on looking at me, out of his knowledge that white men have everything, can do anything; if they don’t, it is because they won’t.”
Gordimer is not hesitant to divulge the desolate side of the human experience in any of her stories. In her opening piece, entitled “The Soft Voice of the Serpent,” she tells of a man in Johannesburg who has recently lost a limb. Though his dignity is clearly shaken, he finds hope in the form of a small locust that shares the same affliction. The story is initially full of optimism as the man realizes that his situation is not as devastating as he imagined, and that the small creature is in the same predicament as he. When the locust flies away, however, he is disheartened. Though the locust has the power of flight, he is left behind in a wheelchair, depending on others for mobility.
The setting for Gordimer’s stories is clearly drawn from her own experience; she was born in Springs, Gauteng, a small town outside Johannesburg. Gordimer worked as a political activist in the 1960s, witnessing effects of racial segregation first-hand. Because Gordimer has spent much of her life addressing racial conflict, it is no wonder that she would choose to incorporate it in her various works of fiction. Her stories are peppered with astute observations about race and equality. “Once there were blacks wanting to be white,” she writes in one story. “Now there are whites wanting to be black. It’s the same secret.”
It is unfortunate that the nature of short stories does not allow for extensive development of characters or setting. As opposed to systematically listing the background information of each tale in its first paragraph to counteract this lack of development, Gordimer opens each piece in medias res. One story, for example, begins: “Somehow it wasn’t altogether a surprise when Waldeck Brand and his wife bumped into Carlitta at a theatre in New York in 1953.” It is as if Gordimer has already introduced Waldeck, his wife, and Carlitta.
Gordimer also separates her tales into smaller groups with a common subtitle, giving them slightly more context. However, one could easily imagine some of the stories being developed into novels—at certain moments, her characters seem to be abandoned too soon.
Nevertheless, “Life Times” manages to portray, in a series of short episodes, the many degrees of human emotion and struggle within the cultural and historical terrain of South Africa. Yet even as she ponders such weighty themes, Gordimer manages to keep her stories light and accessible. Though she writes with the intent of conveying a larger message, her language is always enjoyable and easy to understand. As she analyzes the harsh realities of racial tension and personal loss, Gordimer shows that the human experience is always relatable, even in its bleakest moments.

I grew up in Hackensack, New Jersey. My house stood one block from Clinton Place, a street locally renowned for the fervor with which its residents devote themselves to their Halloween decorations. Skeletons hang from trees, hearses park in front yards, and speakers concealed in bushes play endless loops of “Monster Mash.” On Halloween night, droves of trick-or-treaters and sightseers from around the state descend on Clinton Place. I, in my Supergirl costume and braces, was routinely scared shitless. I loved it.
Halloween is, after all, approaching quickly; it’s time to ready your Netflix queue with films that attempt to recapture that distinct feeling of Halloweens past. While there’s plenty of Eli Roth-curated torture porn to choose from, you could always rewatch “The Exorcist” and speculate as to whether Linda Blair’s head would spin counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. And, of course, there’s no shortage of family-friendly fare for the holiday—“The Nightmare Before Christmas,” say, or even “Hocus Pocus.”  But what I recommend to you is not a Halloween film for kids, but a Halloween film for former kids: Michael Dougherty’s “Trick ‘r Treat” (2007).
The brilliance of “Trick ‘r Treat” lies in its wonderful, primal blend of fear and excitement. It is slick, clever, and fast-paced, with an all-important sense of humor about itself—a dark comedy for those of us who prefer the Michael Myers of the “Austin Powers” variety.The movie was subjected to what barely qualifies as a public release, condemned straight-to-video with criminally little exposure outside of festival screenings. Nevertheless, the movie’s cult popularity has gradually built up momentum, and a sequel is rumored to be in the works.
The film is composed of four interlocking stories. The best of these stars Dylan Baker as the town’s sinister school principal. Baker is most recognizable from his role as a pedophile in 1998’s “Happiness,” and has apparently heartily accepted the creepy typecasting that was bound to result from that part. In another subplot, Anna Paquin anchors a delicious revision of the tale of Little Red Riding Hood.
The picture boasts a number of startling, satisfying reversals, which is especially refreshing when one considers that most feature films can now be extrapolated entirely from their trailers. Without resorting to too much unnecessary gore, “Trick ‘r Treat” treads where lesser horror films dare not—your children’s candy is poisoned, it suggests, and murderers and sex offenders freely roam the streets of your own neighborhood.
Aesthetically, “Trick ‘r Treat” draws much inspiration from comic books, which it visually mimics in its credit sequences and highly stylized conception of a macabre suburbia. This choice should come as no surprise, considering writer-director Dougherty’s background—he scripted both “Superman Returns” and “X2”—and the comic genre dovetails thematically with the film’s focus on youthful subjects.
As adults, we tend to forget the element of danger inherent in the former part of “trick or treat”—the phrase is, after all, a kind of social contract. Sam, the film’s most iconic character, is there to remind us of exactly this. Dougherty first conceived of Sam while an undergraduate at New York University, long before the production of “Trick ‘r Treat.” A demonic trick-or-treater in dirty orange pajamas, he exacts violent revenge on anyone foolish enough to violate the rules of Halloween. He’ll make you think twice about smashing another pumpkin.
What makes a good scary movie? A few buckets of red-dyed corn syrup (or, in Hitchcock’s case, Bosco Chocolate Syrup) and a buxom corpse? Well, raise your expectations. “Trick ‘r Treat” will remind you of everything you forgot to be afraid of.

The “Heavenly Questions” to which Schnackenberg’s title refers are drawn from a set of Chinese poems called “Tianwen,” which ask a series of unanswerable philosophical questions. Schnackenberg consistently draws from this ancient work throughout her collection; her poems are replete with references to philosophy and the pursuit of beauty. But even as she ponders these questions, Schnackenberg does not attempt to find their answers. Rather, she focuses on the emotional weight of asking the questions themselves.
The collection is composed of six poems, all written in hypnotic, unrhymed iambic pentameter. They are abundant with sensuous imagery as well as some more unexpectedly scientific diction—the Latin name of a nautilus, or a description of the logarithmic spiral of a seashell. As Schnackenberg alternates between the vast environment of the sea and the enclosed space within hospitals, she creates a touching exploration of the idea of eternity.
The death of Gertrude Schnackenberg’s husband, the philosopher Robert Nozick (who passed away in 2002), plays a significant role in her poetry. Some of the poems, such as “Sublimaze” and “Venus Velvet No. 2,” take place in the hospital as Schnackenber sits with her husband, awaiting test results. The vivid language that Schnackenberg uses to describe the hospital brings out the beauty in this bleak setting. In one poem, she evokes an X-ray machine: “Black curtains sewn from bolts of consciousness / are held aside by seraphs in black corners: / a stream of flowing atoms, held aside.” In another, she refers to an elevator shaft as “abolished space.” These descriptions of her dreary surroundings have an almost dreamlike quality, especially in “Sublimaze,” where the hospital reminds her of the uncountable doors of a legendary church.
But even in the midst of these lofty visions, the poet’s meditations always circle back to her loved one’s dire condition: “I reasoned that if someone swept a hand / And all the locks fell open all at once / And if the door fell open, he would live.” This plea underlies all of the poems and is echoed in the simple line: “No questions anymore. Just let him live.” In its simplicity, this sentiment is far more powerful than all of her cerebral questions.
Sleep, death’s gentle cousin, is also a recurring theme in “Heavenly Questions;” two of the six poems, in fact, are presented as lullabies. In one, Archimedes is sitting on the shore of a “half-filled” universe, counting grains of sand as his projects (“discarded toys, forgotten thought-machines”) rust beside him. In another, the shell of a Fusiturricula spirals into infinity as the creature grows beneath the waves. The repetition within the blank verse creates a soothing effect, as in the repeated line: “And all is give-and-take, all comes and goes / And hush now, all is well now, close your eyes.” But Schnackenberg does not allow her repeated images to dominate the poems, instead balancing them alonsgide strange descriptions of war and musings on the sensations of the Fustirricula.
The gentle rhythm of Schnackenberg’s verse and her frequent descriptions of sleep also give some of her other poems the quality of lullabies, even when they are not framed as such. Even the poems that touch on the death of her husband have this same soft tone, and she often repeats the line “hush now, all is well now, close your eyes.”
Schnackenberg’s rhythm and her discussion of eternal questions are both unexpectedly strengthened by her pervasive use of mathematical language in the text. Most of her poems include some element of counting towards infinity: Archimedes multiplies X times X times X grains of sand, the legendary church will always have one more door, and the tip of the nautilus spirals outwards forever. Her most striking language is often threaded with mathematical terms, as when she describes a shell made up of “logarithms visible and fused / With thoughts in rows of spiral beaded cords / As X goes to infinity; impearled.”
Moreover, her use of mathematical language informs most of her musings on the so-called heavenly questions. While Schnackenberg does reference some religion—Buddha and the Mahabharata, for instance—her most powerful images of eternity are those such as the endless sand of Archimedes. It is through her close attention to detail—she even describes the intricate graphite lattices of her number two pencil—that Schnackenberg is able to address the larger questions that she is pondering. In this sense she’s very much like Archimedes counting out grains of sand. The minutia she describes may seem as trivial as grains of sand, but these tiny pieces, she seems to argue, build the universe.
While “Heavenly Questions” does not end with any answers or consolation (the final line is “And here the god of writers broke his pen”), it is a fascinating invocation of the wonders of eternity, and a human relationship to eternal questions. Schnackenberg pursues these wonders on all fronts—in mathematical iterations as well as references to science and philosophy, and it is this integrated approach, along with the sheer density of her imagery, that characterizes her compelling new poetry collection.

Clint Eastwood’s “Hereafter” is a harsh film. In almost every frame, there is pain, crowding around the edges and waiting to reenter the scene even during the movie’s brief romantic respites. The film tells the story of George Lonagen (Matt Damon), a psychic who can talk to the dead, but wishes he couldn’t, and Marie LeLay (Cecile de France), a French television anchor whose comfortable life is overturned when she has a near-death experience while surviving a devastating tsumani. But emotionally, “Hereafter” is primarily the agonizing story of a twelve-year-old boy, Marcus, who attempts to come to terms with the death of his twin brother, Jason (both played by Frankie and George McLaren).
What is it about a child’s pain that proves so compelling and resonant on screen? Is it that tortured young actors like Haley Joel Osment (“The Sixth Sense,” “A.I.”) and Freddie Highmore (“Finding Neverland”) are remarkably skilled—or is it something more basic? “Hereafter” suggests that these performances speak to us so viscerally because we are all children in our pain, and so see ourselves most clearly in the image of the anguished child. Whenever we suffer loss, Eastwood’s film shows—repeatedly—how all the defenses we have built over the course of a lifetime, and all the coping mechanisms we have carefully constructed to shield us from the rough edges of existence, fall away.
Eastwood’s “Hereafter” doesn’t set out to soften this reality, but rather to portray different aspects of it through the stories of three characters and their encounters with death. Early in the film, the audience is introduced to twins Marcus and Jason as they cover for their alcoholic, drug-addicted mother, outwitting the social service agents who seek to remove them from her care. But their momentary triumph is soon shattered by tragedy. Fleeing from a band of London street ruffians, Jason runs into the path of a truck and is killed. That night, as the light goes out in his room, a stricken Marcus says good night to Jason’s empty bed; the next day, he is taken to foster care.
On the other side of the world, in San Francisco, George Lonegan is trying and failing to make it as a construction worker. Once a successful psychic, Lonegan has given up the practice—his ability to instantly know a person’s most painful losses simply by touching them is, he asserts, “a curse, not a gift.” With this withdrawn and alienated role, Damon finally returns to the kind of acting which launched his career in “Good Will Hunting”—that of the troubled individual with a remarkable gift that forever sets him apart.
In the film’s third and weakest storyline, television personality Marie LeLay attempts to investigate a vision she had of the afterlife while lying near death after a tsunami. Suddenly, the world she had constructed for herself, one of fashionable pseudo-intellectualism and media glamour, loses its appeal—death is LeLay’s new preoccupation. Her strange obsession leads her to lose her job and many of her friends, but, as one might guess, puts her on a path that will ultimately intersect with that of George and Marcus, whose stories merge when the latter discovers the former’s website. The inevitable meeting between the psychic and the bereaved boy—between the man who desperately seeks to escape the dead, and the child who wishes more than anything to speak to them—is both entirely predictable and incredibly moving, much like the entire movie.
Each story in Peter Morgan’s screenplay illustrates, without any illusions or Hollywood retouching, another side of the painful human struggle with loss. Some characters, like Lonegan, try to run from death or ignore it. Others, like Marcus and LeLay, cannot put it out of their minds. These are people we have met, and experiences we ourselves have had. Thus, at its emotional heart, “Hereafter” is a very familiar film. The ostensibly strange concept of the afterlife turns out to be a plot device used to explore human relationships and loss, much like euthanasia was in Eastwood’s “Million Dollar Baby.” This film is not interested in arguments for or against a world to come, or about whether psychics can truly commune with the dead, but rather in the raw emotions which fuel these debates.
“Hereafter” is not the sort of movie one watches with friends, or that airs repeatedly on television after its release. Films with children dying, graphically-depicted tsunamis and even a terrorist attack, rarely are—at least the kind that don’t destroy national landmarks along the way. Unlike most movies, “Hereafter” invites contemplation of the world at its worst, not an escape from it, and in this it succeeds. But the film also offers hope—for though Eastwood does not come to lessen the pain of human loss, he does remind us of its meaning.

During a time when many ballet companies are struggling to stay afloat, Artistic Director Mikko Nissinen is not only preserving the Boston Ballet, but pushing the company to new heights. His innovative efforts were clear last Saturday evening at the Boston Opera House in the Boston Ballet’s annual one-night-only season opener, “Night of Stars.” Through a masterful interplay between the neoclassical works of George Balanchine and those of his contemporary successors, “Night of Stars” evoked ambition. Boston Ballet’s potential seems limitless as it enters its 47th season.
One of Nissinen’ s aims for “Night of Stars” was to feature previews of Boston Ballet’s upcoming repertoire. The evening opened with “The Kingdom of Shades,” an excerpt from the third act of the full-length classical ballet “La Bayadère,” an exotic and tragic love story set in India. Under the baton of Jonathan McPhee, the Boston Ballet Orchestra played the haunting opening melody as 24 women appeared one by one on the stage in a breathtaking line of white tutus, all balancing together on one leg. A notoriously difficult piece for the corps de ballet (the core group of dancers of the company), the women performed with grace—an exciting preview of the full-length classical ballet which will premiere in two weeks.
The limelight shone on the newly promoted principal and soloist dancers of the Boston Ballet as “Night of Stars” moved from the classical tradition of “La Bayadère” to the works of George Balanchine, the father of American neoclassical ballet. Second soloists Whitney Jensen and Jeffrey Cirio performed the first Balanchine work. Originally premiered in 1964 for two of Balanchine’s own stars, Patricia McBride and Edward Villella, “Tarantella” is a ballet that requires verve and panache. With ringing tambourines and flying ribbons, Jensen and Cirio evoked the vivacity and articulation of “Tarantella’s” originators with their playful energy.
“Night of Stars” also featured two works that paid homage to the brilliant artistic partnership between Balanchine and his neoclassical contemporary, composer Igor Stravinsky. “Scherzo à la Russe,” a lively stylized portrayal of Russian character dance (folk or national dance), featured students from Boston Ballet School who displayed impressive training and enthusiasm.
It has been argued that Stravinsky’s music can only be truly understood through Balanchine’s choreography: this is certainly the case for “Apollo,” the first of Balanchine and Stravinsky’s nearly fifty-year artistic collaboration, and the third Balanchine work featured Saturday evening. Evoking the myth of Apollo and Terpsichore, his muse of dance, Kathleen Breen Combes and Pavel Gurevich brought this 1928 ballet to life with exquisite lines and daring syncopation. With their hands flexed and hips jutted, just as those of the dancers who premiered this work over 80 years ago, Combes and Gurevich showed that “Apollo” was a work before its time.
It was fitting to include Balanchine’s “Apollo” in “Night of Stars,” as this innovative piece laid the groundwork for the choreographers of the evening’ s three contemporary works. Though different in their styles of movement, the trio complemented one another in costume and lighting, together exhibiting Boston Ballet’s contemporary flair. “Layli O Majnun,” choreographed by Helen Pickett, is a preview of her Boston Ballet premiere, “PART I, II, III.” Her duet was followed by an excerpt from “Plan to B,” choreographed by Boston Ballet’s resident choreographer Jorma Elo. Critically acclaimed during Boston Ballet’s 2010 tour of Spain, “Plan to B” was a striking display of movement, as the six performers danced in articulated synchrony to the jarring chords of a harpsichord. The momentum of the evening’s contemporary works culminated in Li 3, a trio choreographed by principal dancer Yury Yanowsky. Rie Ichikawa, John Lam, and Jaime Diaz electrified the stage with raw athleticism, their seamless interplay one of the evening’ s highlights.
A classical complement to the powerful energy of Li 3, the “Le Corsaire” pas de deux—a dance of love between a princess and her slave—was the true gem of the evening. Adiarys Almeida and Joseph Gatti, two new Company soloists, were dazzling in their technical prowess and in their dual chemistry. With Almeida’s flawless pirouettes and Gatti’s powerful jumps, they performed the Corsaire pas de deux with unparalleled virtuosity. However, their performance was noteworthy for more than their technique: it was Almeida’s mysterious allure as princess and Gatti’s bravado as slave that most deeply resonated.
“Night of Stars” also featured two guest artists in a specially added pas de deux, “After the Rain,” by Christopher Wheeldon. Renowned dancers Wendy Whelan, of the New York City Ballet, and Damian Smith, of the San Francisco Ballet, performed this piece with a delicacy and attention to movement that was profound. Ending “Night of Stars” on a traditional note, Nissinen featured two new principals, Lia Cirio and Lasha Khozashvili, in the classic Don Quixote pas de deux alongside Boston Ballet’s famous couple, Erica Cornejo and Nelson Madigral. Their tasteful performance, although perhaps lower in energy than that of other pieces, was lovely nonetheless, and led nicely into the evening’s finale with one of Balanchine’s most classical Russian works, “Theme and Variations.” As Misa Kuranaga and James Whiteside led another 24 dancers in a climactic coda to close the show, it was clear that “Night of Stars” showcased Boston Ballet’s versatility: the company’s ability to embrace up-and-coming choreographers without forgetting its classical foundation.

A man stumbles drunkenly down a dark alleyway in pursuit of his victim, pins him against a wall, and holds a revolver to his neck. It’s a familiar scene, but in John Curran’s “Stone,” it is parole officer Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) who brandishes the gun, and convicted criminal “Stone” (Ed Norton) who finds himself within inches of his life. The scene is the culmination of a role-reversal between cop and criminal that builds over the course of the film.
Aging Detroit prison official Mabry is on the threshold of retirement, but decides to take on one last case: that of arsonist Gerald “Stone” Creason. Stone is hell-bent on shortening his sentence, and begins a dirty campaign to ensure that Mabry succeeds in ensuring his release. Mabry ostensibly knows the ropes, and is not about to let some eccentric inmate get inside his head, but a little meddling from Stone exposes some startling chinks in Jack’s armor.
Norton’s playful one-liners provide the perfect antidote to De Niro’s wizened stoicism. When Mabry accuses him of trying to make trouble, Stone replies, “I don’t want no beef with you. I’m gonna be a vegetarian.” Yet these humorous moments are few and far between. The more Mabry and Stone get to know each other, the more charged their meetings become. Soon Mabry finds himself confronting questions that never crossed his mind in all his years as a god-fearing instrument of justice.
Thus begins Mabry’s latter-life crisis. De Niro hurls himself into the role of ordinary workingman Mabry with terrifying gusto. As befits an actor of his monumental stature, De Niro is utterly absorbed in his role. The problem is that the more one sees of Jack, the less attractive his character becomes. “Stone” depicts the darker side of aging. Instead of becoming more sedate, Mabry drinks more often and more heavily. Instead of growing closer to his wife, he has an affair—with Stone’s vampy wife Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) who deliberately seduces him to help Stone’s cause. At his farewell party—which should be his finest hour—Mabry offends his few remaining friends.
His interaction with Stone seems to rob Mabry of his faith—a recurring theme in the film. Curran is very interested in the hypocrisy of religion, and the emptiness of ritual without belief. For example, though Mabry and his wife are devout Christians, they read passages from the Bible over generous tumblers of whiskey, their diction becoming increasingly slurred with every sip. In scenes of Mabry’s infidelity, the camera clings to his wedding ring as his hands caress Lucetta’s nubile body. The car radio is permanently tuned to a Christian radio station, but a meeting with his pastor fails to answer any of Mabry’s questions.
Curran’s treatment of religion also manages to combine some humor with its moralizing. In the prison library, Stone chances upon a pamphlet on Zukangor, a religion that advocates listening into the humming of the cosmos. One cannot be sure whether he really buys into the philosophy, or if he’s just toying with it to aggravate Mabry. Norton nails the slippery attitude which Mabry finds so galling. Yet by the end of the film, Stone’s mind is at ease, while Mabry’s is increasingly tormented.
While Curran’s handling of religion is sensitive, his treatment of the ambiguity between criminal and cop is clumsier. The film seems driven by a nagging inevitability that De Niro’s convincing performance can do nothing to deflect. Once Curran’s direction becomes clear, and it does so quite early in the film, the film begins to drag a little.
The film’s biggest flaw, however, is that it so thoroughly alienates viewers from the protagonist. Norton’s endearing rendition of Stone wins the audience over from the start. Our first glimpse of Mabry, in a flashback from his young adulthood, is unappealing, but he seems like a fundamentally good guy. By the end of the film, however, the audience feels nothing for Mabry, not even pity. Part of the problem is that De Niro is just too good. He understands his character so thoroughly that he cannot bring himself to endow Mabry with any redeeming qualities, which is to his credit as an actor, but to the detriment of the film as a whole.

In “Conviction,” director Tony Goldwyn and actor Sam Rockwell tell the incredible true story of Betty Anne Waters, who fought to free her brother, Kenny, after he was wrongfully accused of murder. But to create a streamlined narrative befitting a major release, some adherence to historical fact must be sacrificed. However, despite this artistic license, Goldwyn’s independent cinematic endeavors to hew close to reality.
“It’s a love story between brother and sister,” Rockwell states, “and we wanted to get as close to it as we could.”
Even Waters (portrayed in the film by Hilary Swank) feels that the film succeeds in capturing the essence of her story. “The movie is very accurate as far as feelings, how everything went,” Betty Anne says. “But the sequence was different, because it’s not a documentary.”
The film omits Kenny’s death a mere six months after being exonerated; Betty Anne’s nine siblings become two. “It was just my choice as a storyteller,” Goldwyn explains. “I had to do that. And there were many other extraordinary aspects of Betty Anne’s story that I either couldn’t include or cut out of the script because they robbed the story of its focus.”
Additionally, several elements of the plot are rearranged, such as the timing of Betty Anne’s depression, and the fact that it was originally Kenny Water’s idea for the exoneration plan.
“That was my choice,” Goldwyn states. “As a storyteller, it was very important that the character of Betty Anne be the driving force behind this… It was important, for dramatic purposes, to have our heroine. It just wouldn’t have worked as well.”
For Goldwyn, “Conviction” represents much more than another project on his resume. Goldwyn worked alongside Betty Anne for years in order to produce a film worthy of the Waters’ story. “It took me nine years to get it made. It was very difficult,” Goldwyn says. “Dramas in general are hard to get made.”
This proved true, as “Conviction” sat in development hell, without a producer, for years. After a long give-and-take process with Universal Studios, Goldwyn fought to take on the project himself.
“They just wouldn’t green light the movie,” Goldwyn says. “They had money, but they were nervous about it… Finally, they gave us the rights back in ‘turn-around’ [a deal involving the transfer of film rights from one studio to another] and we went and raised the money independently.”
As a result, Goldwyn was forced to cut production costs from an original $25 million budget to $12.5 million. Despite cost cuts, Goldwyn, Betty Anne, and the cast worked to produce the best film they could.
“Just like Hilary [Swank] does, I have high standards. There’s always a way to make it better,” Rockwell says. “You think you’ve reached a plateau, but you sort of bust through to the next plateau… I always believe that there’s another level you can get to.”
Indeed, Rockwell’s high standards even satisfied Betty Anne. “He really nailed it,” Betty Anne says.
For Rockwell, the part of Kenny was also an opportunity to experiment with a truly multi-dimensional character. “It’s an incredible story, and it’s a great part for an actor,” Rockwell describes. “It’s a very classical part, like Mercutio from ‘Romeo and Juliet’ or Johnny Boy in ‘Mean Streets.’ He’s a charming, dangerous, complicated guy… The thing that was important to me was to have this kind of very concrete gravitas that only comes from somebody who’s been through something like that.”
Rockwell and Swank worked hand-in-hand to produce believable characters that stayed true to Betty Anne and Kenny. Their believable chemistry as brother and sister is a key aspect of the film. “It’s war when I’m ready to do a role,” Rockwell explains. “We both go with this sort of no-rock-unturned kind of approach to our preparation. [Swank] is a force of nature. It was kind of like two pretty good boxers, or two great tennis players batting it. I felt we were both on our A-game.”
With such players on her team, the production of “Conviction” became a very emotional and fulfilling experience for Betty Anne. And Waters did not just sit on the sideline; this was her story, and she helped to tell it. Goldwyn explains, “Betty Anne was on set the large percentage of the time. We leaned on her heavily, and she was very involved.”
“I felt like it was two years of therapy,” Betty Anne says. “It was very emotional.”
Perhaps more importantly, Betty Anne believes her brother would be proud of the film. “Kenny would be so excited right now,” Waters states. “Kenny would be king. He would be thrilled. He would have loved this movie.”

Last July, Ian A. Frazier ’73 spoke to National Public Radio about his most recent nonfiction work, “Travels in Siberia.” When asked why he had ventured into the territory (five times in 16 years), Frazier replied, “Well, I think, I wanted to step out of time… You’re going somewhere, and you’re no longer just in the company of your own contemporaries. You’re in the company of everybody that’s ever traveled here.” “Travels in Siberia” is a sprawling account of Frazier’s physical journey across continents (eight time zones in Siberia alone) but also through time. The book treks through modern-day Siberia, recreated with Frazier’s perceptive prose, and through the pages of the travel accounts the author cites. Frazier, who has been a long-time staff writer and essayist for The New Yorker, received support from the publication for his travels in the region. This latest work exemplifies the sort of long-form nonfiction The New Yorker has encouraged and sustained since its inception. As Frazier’s tribute to those who journeyed across the territory before him, this epic travelogue is indicative of the nonfiction genre’s capacity to reconstruct stories, and in doing so redeem their origins.
“If plot (as we are told) equals characters, and vice versa, then maybe a similar equivalence exists between setting and genre,” Frazier writes, referencing the autobiography of Johann Schiltberger, who as a captive of Tamerlane traveled to Siberia and made the first literary reference to the place. “Schiltberger’s example leads us to expect that Siberia’s genre will be the travel story, not surprisingly, because one can’t begin to know a place that big without moving around. Sometimes the Siberian genre will also be the slave narrative, a personal account of bondage and suffering… Schiltberger also points to another, lighter Siberian genre, just as inseparable from geographic vastness—the picaresque.”
“Travels in Siberia” follows in the tradition of Schiltberger’s first mention of Siberia. Frazier’s travel story is one of an oft-failing van, a couple of sturdy, opinionated Russian guides, murderous mosquitoes in the buggy, muggy Siberian summer months, beautiful “Miss Universe” Russian women, Russian friends that share the same six names, and more eccentric moments: suddenly being waylaid by a road of watermelon sellers who shove the fruit through the open windows of the van; a beach in Vladivostok covered ankle-deep in gorgeous, sea-worn glass.
Poised and often poignant, Frazier’s prose is markedly one of detailed reportage. With the skill of a critical storyteller, he traverses the most mundane facts with ease and enthusiasm, such that even his recitation of statistics and numerous descriptions of meals (usually cottage cheese and kielbasa) compel curiosity, rather than boredom. It helps that Frazier’s often self-deprecating humor is so charming. Confronted with inevitable aphasia, the author writes at length about his intrigue with the Russian language and his struggles to communicate. Nestled in the adventures, the memoirs, and the historical data, the book’s most endearing moments rest with Frazier’s accounts of his linguistic successes and failures: the author indulges himself by proudly recounting the four times he made native Russians laugh.
Despite the comedic elements of this narrative, Frazier notes that there remains an undercurrent of sadness coursing through the territory. The author’s focus on the extensive history of Siberian exiles is unfiltered, as bleak as such an account must be. “Travels in Siberia” honors the innumerable populations sent to Siberia’s prison camps and strip mines (this punishment remained in vogue from approximately the beginning of the first tsar’s regime to the end of Stalin’s). “Travels in Siberia” is thus not only the story of Frazier’s adventure, as it manages to invite focus into the minute details of these individuals’ lives, lending veneration, but especially exposure to their hardships.
Unable to refrain from criticizing the Siberian gulag, Frazier writes beautifully, harshly, and politically about the atrocities committed there. “Using a place as punishment may or may not be fair to the people who are punished there, but it always demeans and does a disservice to the place,” he writes. Later, when Frazier encounters a deserted prison camp, he remarks on the aura of ignominy that seems to surround the place, even tucked away into the woods. “What struck me then and still strikes me now was the place’s overwhelming aura of absence,” he writes. “The deserted prison camp just sat there—unexcused, un-torn down, unexplained. During its years of operation it had been a secret, and in some sense it still was. Horrors had happened here, and/or miseries and sufferings and humiliations short of true horrors. ‘No comment,’ the site seemed to say.”
And making a comment is exactly what “Travels in Siberia” attempts to do. Near the end of the book, Frazier arguably draws a link between the government’s earlier effort to censor journalists by confiscating materials associated with the Siberian gulag and a current trend whereby Stalin’s estimation is rising in the eyes of Russia’s citizens. Frazier seems to want to resist the effacing effects of time, by carving out a place in Siberia for those who never had the chance to preserve their lives in literature. “Just as the twentieth century split the atom, it took apart the human soul; in the camps of the Siberian gulag the soul’s reduction approached the absolute,” Frazier pens. “Writers… who might have described the horrors did not survive to do so. Among those who did survive, the experience usually depleted the residue of hope in them to a level where they didn’t have much left to write with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yo-Yo Ma ’76 was not a music concentrator. One of the most celebrated cellists in history, he had already performed for two United States presidents by the time he was seven. Perhaps, considering his background, he did not feel the need for extensive music classes during his undergraduate years. After all, Harvard happily granted him an honorary degree in music of its own volition in 1991.
“He was already a fully accomplished performer; he didn’t come to Harvard to learn how to do that. He went to Harvard to become an educated person,” says contemporary Robert B. Sirota, who worked towards his PhD in composition during Ma’s time on campus. Sirota is now the president of the prestigious Manhattan School of Music.
After all, Harvard is not a conservatory. Some claim the music department—which focuses mainly on theory and history rather than performance—does not prepare students quite as well for a potential career in music performance. As economics concentrators often scramble for interviews with Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company in their last undergraduate years, the path from student to career musician remains ill-defined. Campus recruiting is simply not available to the aspiring composer, conductor, or performer.
Despite these disadvantages, some music concentrators still feel that they benefit substantially from the department’s focus on theory and musicology. Others find more explicit performance instruction available through cross-registration with the New England Conservatory (NEC).  Likewise, the wide array of extracurricular performance opportunities at Harvard still gives students the chance to hone their skills outside of the classroom. Ultimately, what music concentrators find at Harvard is a balance they feel would be unavailable at a traditional conservatory.
PRIMO ET SECONDO
Harvard’s music department houses one of the college’s smallest concentrations, with just 24 undergraduates currently enrolled in the program. The department places more substantial emphasis on musicology, theory and composition than on performance. Concentrators and non-concentrators alike speak highly of the music history and theory classes. “There’s certainly a type of preparation that Harvard courses give that other places, such as conservatories, won’t,” says Yuga J. Cohler ’11, conductor of the Bach Society Orchestra, who is pursuing a secondary degree in music. “The musicology and music history departments here are very good.”
David H. Miller ’11, a music concentrator and double bassist, agrees that the academic portion of the curriculum is important to any musician’s education. “An undergraduate academic degree in music is something that would benefit most musicians, even if they go on to only focus on performance. Having the analytical tools that it gives you and being able to think about music in that way is useful,” he says.
The music department prides itself on its ability to offer students the same kind of music theory education that they would receive at professional music schools. Mary C. Gerbi, Assistant to the Chair and Undergraduate Coordinator, echoes these students’ sentiments. “As a concentration, the curriculum serves the students, because if they were going to an undergraduate conservatory, a lot of the academic side of what they were doing would be similar to what we ask them to do here.”
However, the department does not provide a bevy of academic outlets in the realm of performance. This disparity can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on whom you ask. Miles W. Canaday ’10, a former music concentrator who is now studying for a masters’ degree in choral conducting at the Yale School of Music, feels that this teaching strategy was enormously helpful. “Personally, it was kind of perfect for me, because as a conductor you do a lot—a lot—of research and a lot of analysis, perhaps more so than someone who’s going into music professionally as an instrumentalist or a singer.”
Other students, including Cohler, feel that an overly strong focus on theory neglects other necessary components of musical pedagogy. “In the department, there is a tendency towards abstraction that isn’t always helpful for performers,” says Cohler.
As a result, some students who desire a more performance-intensive curriculum cross-register in a five-year joint program with NEC. Upon completion, students emerge with a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a master’s in music from the NEC. Some students, such as Nicolas A. Olarte-Hayes ’11, a cellist and conductor, see this as a beneficial relationship, as it allows students to pursue performance studies on one campus and academic, theoretical studies at Harvard. “Harvard historically has a really good academic program in music, but it’s not the only thing I want,” he says. Olarte-Hayes is concentrating in physics with a secondary in music.
Oliver D. Strand ’11, a literature concentrator who is also cross-registered with the NEC as a composer and violinist, felt that he needed to study other subjects in order to enhance his understanding of music. “It can open up ways of thinking that are foreign to the technique in the craft you are trained to study. I hoped to continue studying in that way when I got here.”
Conversely, other students feel that cross-registered students are often distanced from the music scene at Harvard. “You get this sort of—this small group of people who are very serious about their performance, who do a lot of stuff sort of, like, off-campus or just do a lot stuff sort of on their own, and aren’t like, always super engaged with what’s going on on campus,” Miller says. “[It’s] too bad, in some ways.”
A LIMITED REPERTOIRE
Olarte-Hayes feels that the music department is ambivalent about the balance between theory and performance instruction. Yet the conflict between these two distinct elements of professional music is hardly a new development in the music department at Harvard. This past Thursday, Sirota spoke in a panel discussion at Harvard entitled “Discerning New Visions for Music Conservatories: Lessons from El Sistema.” The panel addressed questions of musical career preparation in traditional music conservatories by discussing the strategies of the public musical education system in Venezuela.
Sirota claims that the pedagogical debate between a department emphasis either on theory or performance has been running for a while. “There was a lot of thoughtful discussion about it when I was a graduate student,” he says. Sirota adds that students who do not have a performance outlet as part of their academic opportunities often give short shrift to this aspect of their education. “Extracurricular or cocurricular activity, no matter how high-level or respectable it is, cannot be given the same amount of attention by undergraduates as curricular activity,” he says.
Perhaps for this reason, the department has recently taken steps to increase its academic focus on performance. After curricular reconsiderations in the past few years, the department has incorporated a number of courses with a larger focus on performance, including Music 185r: “Classical Improvisation,” Music 186: “Jazz Improvisation,” and Music 187r: “Chamber Music Performance.”
Students like Miller appreciate the increased opportunities afforded by these classes. He doubts that Harvard could overhaul the program entirely to create a performance department. “It’s not like they can go out and start hiring more faculty members, which would really be the thing to do if you wanted to cater to these performance people. But that’s not an option, for obvious reasons,” says Miller. “It’s a good thing that we stick with what we know and what the department is prepared for,” Canaday adds.
Thomas Forrest Kelly, the Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music and head tutor for the department, claims that the music department nurtures performers outside of the classroom with the depth and breadth of its faculty’s experiences. “There’s a lot of accumulated lore and expertise in the building,” he says.
Still, some students feel they do not have access to much interaction with music professors. “Most of the courses that we take are not taught by professors. They’re taught by lecturers or, at best, an associate professor. Every now and then they give you a professor,” Olarte-Hayes says.
A SCORE OF ACTIVITIES
Cohler claims that the scarcity of non-theory classes is actually a blessing in disguise; he feels that it encourages the students to take initiative in creating opportunities for themselves. “I don’t know that [the Bach Society Orchestra] would exist if Harvard didn’t allow to its undergraduates to take so much initiative in producing performances, so I have to be thankful for that. I think a lot of musicians who have come out of Harvard have echoed this sentiment as well.”
Students and faculty alike feel that the performance community on campus is incredibly vibrant. “Because Harvard has such an active music extracurricular program anyway, it doesn’t really matter that the music school itself isn’t really the one that is pushing performance,” says Kirby E. Haugland ’11, a trumpeter and joint music and mathematics concentrator.
Harvard boasts a vast community of extracurricular organizations, including Bach Society Orchestra, Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and various choral and a cappella groups. As evidenced by the wide variety of concerts and workshops that occur throughout the year, Harvard students seem to take pride in  music performance.
The Office for the Arts also runs programs to bring performers onto campus to interact with students. The “Learning from Performers” initiative, first established in 1975, brings a variety of performers, including musicians, to campus to speak with students and conduct workshops in their respective fields.
Thomas S. Lee, the Program Manager for Learning from Performers, believes that the workshops conducted with the artists are as eye-opening for the visitors as they are for the students in attendance. “Whenever we have our jazz artists come in, it’s always a big eye-opener for them. They can’t imagine why someone is who concentrating in neuroscience is such a great sax player…that’s just the culture here,” Lee says.
Despite the quality of the performers and participants, Lee also notes that there is typically a noticeable absence of music concentrators at such events. “It’s surprising that we don’t get that many, but I think it’s because there is no performance concentration at Harvard,” he says. “The opportunities are limited to more co-curricular programs.”
IMPROVISED MEASURES
In comparison to the recruitment programs provided by other concentrations, Kelly says, “it looks as though we are not very proactive in our support of music concentrators.”
However, he feels that this assumption is inaccurate, as Harvard’s music students find a rich network of genuine human connections within the department. Students who wish to pursue further music opportunities can receive recommendations and advice about their career path. As Kelly puts it, “What supports the music concentrators here is not so much us the administrators…but the kind of critical mass of people here who are milling around all the time and talking about music.”
In addition to the personal networking that occurs within the department, the music concentration also offers programs such as the John Knowles Paine Traveling Fellowship. The Fellowship provides students and graduates with funds to travel internationally and study music as graduate students. Past members of the program have continued their studies in places as diverse as Iceland, India, and Japan.
Still, other students feel that music does not make as much of an effort to provide its students with career advice and productive connections as other departments do. Cohler, who is in the process of deciding between a job offer in finance and further graduate studies in conducting, feels that the music department has enormous, yet fairly unfulfilled, potential for networking. “The music department does not leverage its many possible connections in the same way as something like the Office of Career Services does,” says Cohler.
Although the music department does not offer concrete career counseling, students seem to agree that a Harvard education, taken as a whole, offers a more well-rounded liberal arts education than a conservatory would. “When I ended up coming to Harvard,” says Haugland, “part of the reason was that I would get the chance to receive the excellent Harvard general education.”
As with many other aspects of student life at Harvard, achieving success as a music concentrator appears to be an issue of balance between scholarly and extracurricular life—and a certain degree of self-motivation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, freshmen who signed up for a music theory seminar have been dancing to tunes from Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story.” In another freshman seminar, a normally discussion-based course found itself wrist-deep in calligrapher’s ink. In a contemporary Muslim literature seminar,  Garage Band, Apple’s do-it-yourself recording studio software, was used to overcome Islamophobia. Regardless of previous experience in the arts, students and professors alike in the Freshman Seminar Program are taking advantage of new funding to experiment with non-traditional arts-making in the classroom.
Increased support for the arts began last year with funds provided by President Drew G. Faust. A donation from Louis G. Elson ’85 for $100,000 a year for the next five years has and will continue to support this initiative.
“It is not just freshman seminars that have been targeted by this funding,” says Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, Director of the Freshman Seminar Program, regarding the Elson Family Arts Initiative. “But this type of class was certainly seen as a place where the kind of teaching and learning that investigation of the arts supports could happen in a productive way.”
The initiative covers costs for excursions and guest artists for Freshman Seminars, where the small class size provides a prime venue for facilitating arts appreciation. Emily Gallardo, a freelance graphic designer in Boston who runs a hand-made greeting card business, recently visited History and Literature Lecturer Phoebe F. Putnam’s “Painting with Words” seminar. Gallardo gave a demonstration of her trade and passed out calligraphy pens and ink samples so that each student could practice calligraphic techniques. Lily R. Glimcher ’14, a student in the seminar, says, “You hope for these kinds of chances in college. To work with a professional in the arts is exciting.”
With the Elson Family Arts Initiative, Carol J. Oja, Professor of Music, brought a guest instructor to her seminar on Leonard Bernstein for the past two years. This instructor facilitates one class where students can discuss the musical theory of “West Side Story,” and then get up and dance to its compositions.
“With this initiative, I sat back and thought, ‘What could I do that I never imagined as possible before?’ I am a music historian, I don’t dance, but in the context of this class, understanding the body and the physical sensation of moving to Bernstein’s music is crucial,” Oja says.
“Dancing is a revealing lens. It has not been a fluffy add-on. It has turned out to be deeply fundamental to the class in ways I hadn’t anticipated,” Oja continues, expressing the opinion that the initiative is a progressive step for the university to take in times of fiscal constraint.
Naddaff believes that seminars supported by the initiative have demonstrated how artistic endeavors can be naturally integrated into any classroom. “This funding, for which we are very grateful, serves to foreground the possibility of this kind of innovative pedagogy and learning throughout the program,” she says. “It is not just limited to the ones deemed arts-centric.”
Professors of traditionally non-artistic courses recognize the multifaceted power of the arts. Daniel L. Shapiro, Associate Director of the Harvard Negotiation Project at Harvard Law School, aims to bring arts-making into his seminar, “Negotiation and Conflict Management: Dealing with Emotions and Identity.”
Shapiro says, “I am more and more struck by the power of art. It allows us to create symbols or images that stick in people’s heads for longer than when conveyed in the jargon of academia.”
Allowing student agency during the artistic process has been a key element in an ongoing project in Shapiro’s class. The professor arranged for Romero Britto, a renowned Brazilian-born neo-pop artist, to visit his seminar and help the class produce a series of painted canvasses that illustrate points of study in the course. Britto’s work has been featured in the Louvre Museum. However, he is also known for running a coexistence workshop that brought together Israeli and Palestinian girls. Britto was inspired by the idea that cooperative art-making could represent a step towards conflict resolution and mutual understanding.
Apart from initiating contact with Britto, Shapiro is letting his students do the planning for the artist’s visit. Eric M. Hendey ’14, a student in the seminar, says, “It is refreshing to be able to choose on our own how we will approach the experience.”
According to Shapiro, Britto’s office supported the students’ proposal, and the artist himself expressed excitement at the prospect of working with such an intimate group. Harleen K. Gambhir ’14 is looking forward not only to mixing paints, but also synthesizing viewpoints during the visit. “People in our class are coming from a lot of perspectives, and art will be a way to merge those perspectives,” she says.
History professor Ali S. Asani ’77 also attests to the new dimensions that arts can bring to academic discussion. He says, “I combat fear and prejudice with arts education. I just find that the arts are such a powerful tool to humanize cultures that are dehumanized in the media and politics.”
Asani’s seminar, “Muslim Voices in Contemporary World Literature,” requires that students create a portfolio of artistic responses to particular topics covered in discussions of literature. Students can use any artistic medium they choose, and the Elson Family Arts Initiative foots the bill for the materials.
One of Asani’s students, Cote K. Laramie ’14, recorded an original musical piece in Garage Band after reading about the importance of sound in Islamic religious practices. Laramie says, “I would rather record a song than write a very formulated response paper. These projects allow us to work for ourselves, which I believe is the essence of this seminar.”
Asani, a member of the Harvard community for over thirty years, says, “This initiative was a breath of fresh air. There is a prejudice against the arts. The arts are seen as marginal or recreational or extracurricular. At times when you think you have to defend your curriculum from those who marginalize the arts, the fact that Harvard endorses an arts curriculum makes a difference.”

In a non-descript building located within an open yet inconspicuous setting in downtown Somerville, six Harvard undergraduates and their art history professor explore the Harvard Art Museum’s storage facility, challenging traditional artistic views while preparing their own upcoming group museum exhibitions.
These projects will represent the weeks of research and careful planning executed in Professor David Bindman’s proseminar History of Art and Architecture (HAA) 171m: “British Art in the Harvard Museum.” The course will assemble and present three British art exhibitions over the course of the semester, two of which will be in the Sackler Museum and the last of which will be online.
Bindman, a visiting emeritus professor of University College, London and current W.E.B. Du Bois Institute Fellow, first came to Harvard as a graduate student in 1963. Early this year, however, Bindman’s colleague, HAA professor Jennifer L. Roberts, suggested that he teach a course on British art.
“I was very excited at the idea because there’s a great, very neglected collection of British art in the Harvard Art Museum,” Bindman says. “It has been a great treat to explore the collection…with students.”
To explore the institution’s archives, Bindman and his students make regular trips to the Somerville storage facility. In particular, the course works with the nineteenth-century British art collection of Grenville L. Winthrop (Class of 1886). Although Winthrop’s collection holds some of the finest examples of art from this period, it remains relatively unknown outside Harvard due to the donor’s stipulation that his collection not leave the university. For this reason, Bindman says studies of these works are scarce.
For Marcella A. Marsala ’11, these trips to see Harvard’s artwork up close have been a key aspect of the course. “There’s something about looking at a piece of art in person that just can’t be duplicated by looking at it on screen,” Marsala says.
Commenting on the more interactive aspects of the course, Marsala adds that she also enjoys the creativity involved in the process of designing the group art exhibit. “One of my favorite advantages is gaining the experience of curating an exhibition and all of the hard work that goes into it. It’s much more than writing just a research paper.”
While Bindman’s students will have to write a final paper on some aspect on the online exhibit, their collected essays will then serve as a catalog to accompany the online project.
Whereas this first exhibition, entitled “The Past and the Present: British Art of the Nineteenth Century,” was arranged by Bindman, the second exhibition, as well as the final online exhibition, will be organized entirely by his students. Not only will they have to choose a limited number of works to showcase, but they will also have to consider issues of space, accessibility, and presentation. In the end however, both the Harvard Art Museum and Bindman’s students will benefit from this exercise.
In addition to teaching students how to think like curators, Bindman says he hopes to encourage students to appreciate British art in its richness, diversity, and deceptive simplicity. He elaborated on this sentiment during a gallery talk held October 21 in the Sackler, during which he approached British art and its depictions of myth and the Middle Ages as resonating with the nineteenth-century public as well as with modern viewers.
“It’s a way of just looking at various works that in their own different ways look at the past and [then] seeing how you can begin to see them as having contemporary relevance,” Bindman says.
With so many works of British art in the Harvard Art Museum, the course hopes to communicate the rich diversity not only of British art but of Harvard’s collection in general with Bindman at the helm of this initiative. He joins a relatively small number of professors from Harvard’s history who designed a course a course that specifically addresses the complex study of British art. “I’m very happy that the arrangements were made to invite [Bindman] to come and fill a gap in the Harvard art history department,” Marsala says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Czechoslovakian-born filmmaker Harun Farocki has used video games, soccer matches, and remote weaponry as subjects for his films. No stranger to experimentation, Farocki has pushed at the boundaries of his medium, defying categorization by producing pieces in television, narrative film, documentary, film essay, and criticism. Many of these works have been displayed in museums and galleries around the world. Since the creation of his first film in 1966, he has used his work as social commentary, all the while exploring the capabilities of film.
Farocki is currently co-curator of an exhibition at the Carpenter Center, entitled “The Image in Question. War-Media-Art.” Running from October 21 to December 23, the exhibition, which explores the nature of modern warfare and its representations, features a variety of media, from photography and computer animation to multi-screen video installations. Farocki is also teaching two classes at Harvard this semester, both of which explore the form and influence of documentary film.
The Harvard Crimson: Could you give a quick overview of the exhibition?
Harun Farocki: The title is “War-Media-Art,” so from that you see already that it is mainly about the question of how war can be represented nowadays in an eloquent way. This is not really a question that is answered by the popular media—television tries to answer it, but how effective is that really? We’re looking at how different forms of art can represent war: should it be computer images or animation and so on: how can war be represented ethically?
THC: What do you think are the difficulties of representing modern warfare?
HF: Wars today are very asymmetrical—one party is far stronger than the other, which is quite unlike earlier warfare. We also see that the classical moments in which wars have been decided—moments like the battle, the siege, and so on—no longer exist, and now we have remote weapons, where you can sit in a bunker in Florida and launch a weapon. All of these things have changed. Plus, the images themselves have become a part of war—not as propaganda, but as part of communication and part of the tactics of war.
THC: What sorts of images are playing an active part in warfare?
HF: They are what I call operational images: no longer needed just to depict something, they are needed as tools of pattern recognition. We see satellite images being used by software to find certain shapes and then they are translated into round shapes or square shapes or whatever to find the target. Images are a means of recognition, of tracking; it’s a total integration into the strategy of war.
THC: The exhibition deals with video game technology and simulation. How did you become interested in that medium?
HF: It’s the same question of how war can be represented. Obviously computer animation is no longer a tool for kids, it has become a tool for exercises for soldiers, for tactical issues. It is almost on the verge of entering standard usage, to the point that the photographical image seems to be. These images are striving to be like photographical images, but the difference is they can use real data, that you can put in data and manipulate the image. So now the spectator can have a much more active role in really altering the image.
THC: You have been using multiple screens in your work for about a decade now. What do you think this particular technique offers?
HF: There is a strange interaction in using two screens—you get a depiction of the same moment from totally different points of view, and it is difficult for the viewer to align these points of view. It can also make the world more spacious, it can remove linearity—the co-presence of these images has a very interesting effect.
THC: Could you speak a little bit about the classes you’re teaching?
HF: I am teaching two classes here at Harvard. One is for graduate students called “Style and Structure:” there we are looking at the basis for the structure of the documentary—is the focus the voice, or narration, or composition of images, or is there something deeper? The second course is for undergraduates, called “Contingency and Control,” and it’s about films which borrow from the documentary. This began many years ago with the Neorealists, but we still see many feature films which strive to be like the documentary. It is a really interesting phenomenon, and we look at 15 or 16 examples.

Can you still party if you know you’re going to die tomorrow? In William Shakespeare’s “Antony and Cleopatra,” the eponymous characters’ imminent demise does not preclude their debauchery. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of this play—which features such outrageous elements as a live snake—details the tragic love affair of Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony against the backdrop of a waning Egypt and a Rome torn between republic and empire.
The play, which is based upon Sir Thomas North’s 1579 translation of Plutarch’ s “Life of Mark Antony,” is considered one of Shakespeare’s most complex, yet underperformed. “Scholars don’t usually find Antony and Cleopatra as appealing as characters… because they are squabbling, they are lustful, and they make stupid mistakes rather than forgivable mistakes. They are old but childish,” director Joseph G. Hodgkin ’12 says.
“Antony is pretty stupid; he’s kind of a jock. He is very brash and very buff, and he gets by on force of personality, charisma, and sheer bravado. He’s like a teenager trapped in a middle-aged man’s body,” adds Caleb J.T. Thompson ’14, who plays Mark Antony.
However, those working on the show feel that the personality flaws of the characters combined with Shakespeare’s intricate blend of tragic and comic elements allows them to be far more relatable and realistic. “In real life you joke about terrible things. Nothing is ever just sad, and sometimes things are funny because they are sad,” Hodgkin adds.
“This [complexity] makes the show incredibly human,” says Sara S. Lytle ’12, who stars opposite Thompson as Cleopatra. “All of these characters are incredibly dynamic and really real. You can feel a sense of empathy for them because they are not just cookie-cutter molds, walking around saying lines.”
Over the summer Hodgkin cut nearly a third of the play in an effort to tighten the text. He says, “The stuff that is left is the funniest, the sexiest, the most violent, the most politically intriguing… I promise that the text is completely different from any production of ‘Antony and Cleopatra’ you would see.”

Kings of Leon made a widely publicized promise to a return back to their roots with their newest studio album, “Come Around Sundown.” But the songwriting does not only fail to herald back the style of early Kings of Leon, it leaves much to be desired by all standards; with forgettable compositions that lack a heart, the band’s latest work is disappointing for die-hard fans and new ones alike. There are a few redeeming songs which contain stronger lyrics from Caleb Followhill and his two brothers-turned-bandmates manage to somewhat absolve this album with astounding drums and bass guitars throughout the songs. However, “Come Around Sundown,” though it has strong musical performances, is entirely held back by the poverty of the music and lyrics.
The lyrics on “Come Around Sundown” is glaring in its failed attempt to appeal to a generic crowd. In one of the most lyrically weak songs, “Back Down South”, Caleb sings “Come out and dance / If you get the chance” followed by “Underneath the stars / Where we park the cars”. This unnecessary rhyming couplet style makes the song feel repetitive, dull and written for the sake of rhyme rather than feeling. Fortunately Caleb’s rustic voice saves the drab combination of syllables, but such a tolerance wears off as the album progresses. By the time the phrase “I got no money but I want your soul” repetitively kicks in during the bridge of “No Money”, it sounds like the band just gave up on writing meaningful songs and went straight for the hooks.
Admittedly, the album has some stronger points that render “Come Around Sundown” an acceptable venture for the Followhill crew. “Radioactive”—which was the first single from this album and which also made it into the US Billboard Alternative songs charts at number 1—has a vibe similar to Kings of Leon classics such as “On Call”, “Sex on Fire” and “Notion.” It has a strong combination of energetic riffs, intense drumming and emotive vocals, which send a tingle down the spine. It’s a shame that the rest of the album does not follow the success of this track; although the lyrics are not the best the band have produced (“It’s in the water / It’s in the story / It’s where you came from” sounds more clichéd each time it’s repeated) the passion and feeling in the song holds strong and it is the only one which can be remembered from a monotonous collection of 16 songs.
The deluxe edition of the album does, however, come with a “Choir Remix” of “Radioactive,” which is a convincing plea for a second chance after this less than revolutionary fifth album. The gospel dimension added to the song demonstrates Caleb’s talent as a vocalist in drawing out notes to impart feeling and emotion. The extra depth added by the chorus of backup vocals brings attention to the tight composition of the instrumental sections.
There is also hope for Kings of Leon in songs like “Pickup Truck”, which opens with calm music and smooth vocals and builds to hit a strong climax as Caleb belts “Hate to be so emotional / I didn’t mean to get physical”. Combining the right level of meaningful lyrics with a powerful guitar and percussion blend, the song serves to balance out the more intense nature of “Radiocactive.” However, this blend of musical and lyrical success cannot be found anywhere else in the album.
While they were true to their southern rock roots, Kings of Leon have given successful products like “Youth and Young Manhood.” They do seem to have a sound of their own to give but this under-par album falls short of reaching both what fans have come to know and love and what might possibly garner Kings of Leon wider fame. It’s unfortunate to think that a band that brought such strong music throughout the past few years may be losing touch with their audience; but it’s even more unfortunate to think that they are trying to expand their appeal at the expense of their established fans.

The beginning of Bob Dylan’s career was defined by an explicit project: the revivification of the American folk music tradition that had its roots in late nineteenth century union hymns and its golden age during the Great Depression. The latest of Dylan’s vaunted Bootleg Series, “Volume 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964,” captures Dylan at the height of his devotion to this form. So great was his ability to give voice to uniquely American notions of vagabondage, romance, and leftist dissatisfaction, that he came to do more than simply reignite a love for folk music and what it stood for—he came to embody it.
Though Dylan would transcend even this success in leaving behind traditional folk, his work from this period combines folk’s intrinsic faith in progress and interest in human pathos with a clarity never before reached and never reached since. “The Witmark Demos” may be the best distillation yet of this musical eloquence, as its 47 tracks—which include 15 songs that had never made it onto an official Dylan release—show the troubadour’s gifts for expressing folk’s major emotional, narrative, and characterological themes.
Perhaps the most wonderful of Dylan’s evocations of folk standards centers on descriptions of world-weary travel; of love and distance; and of the individuals who embody these states. “Poor Boy Blues”—a previously unreleased track that is typical in its uncomplicated musical range—concerns the isolation and powerlessness of traveling without money or friends. A series of direct addresses, such as “Hey you ole train / Let a poor boy ride” and “Blow your whistle policeman / My poor feet are trained to run,” develop the traveler’s attempt to communicate and connect with an inhospitable world that is either unwilling to help or actively against him. This motif relies heavily on music from the Great Depression, most notably Woody Guthrie and songs like his “Ramblin’ Round.” Dylan appropriates the word “ramble” constantly in “The Witmark Demos.”
The search for connection and sense of melancholy expressed in this story of hobo transience is equally beautiful when applied to love in “Tomorrow Is a Long Time.” After a long and plaintive guitar solo, Dylan sings sweetly through feedback, “If today was not a crooked highway / If tonight I could finally stand tall / If tomorrow wasn’t such a long time / Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all.” The world need only be normal for the song’s subject to not feel his isolation; instead, everything is off, the day is “crooked,” as if time itself were nonlinear. Indeed, love in this song is steeped in the language of the impossible, as both the external world and the self are incapable of achieving what is apparently attainable and normal. “I can’t see my reflection in the waters,” Dylan sings, and it seems that, despite his painfully powerful emotions, he is disconnected completely from his surroundings.
And yet, the very next song of the collection illuminates the world as a set of real possibilities that have drastic implications for those in it. Indeed, the protest songs on “The Witmark Demos” are ultimately concerned with the necessity to fight the deep injustices of the world. In “The Death of Emmett Till,” another previously unreleased track, Dylan follows Emmett Till’s awful story with the injunction, “But if all us folks that thinks alike / If we gave all we could give / We could make this great land of ours / A greater place to live.” The song, then, is not about the indifference of the world, like “Poor Boy Blues,” or about the cruelty of racism, so much as it is about the ability of everyday people to fight what is wrong with our society. To the extent that Emmett Till’s murder was unspeakable, we must feel inspired and able to make the world “greater” just as our land is already “great.”
This ethical framework is not limited to Dylan’s songs with an explicitly topical bent. “The Witmark Demos” consistently display an aesthetic of morality, whether it be in the consideration of the harsh reality facing drifters or that of the lovesick, whose moral status is invoked in their inability to “stand tall” and in the “crooked” nature of their lives. This moral commitment relegated the focus and style of folk singers, and Dylan’s artistic move beyond it in the mid-to-late 1960s produced some of the greatest music of his time. However, it may be this same faith in the aesthetic beauty of moral truths that not only made this period of Dylan’s work epochal, but also what makes folk music itself such a tremendously worthy form.

Shakira’s latest album, “Sale el Sol,” is a stroll down memory lane. Sung primarily in Spanish, her seventh record is strongly reminiscent of some of her past artistic endeavors, like “Oral Fixation.” As a whole, the album is based on a mixture of Latin and rock n’ roll influences. Through this range of interests, Shakira showcases her ability to captivate many different audiences. Although this sometimes means that the album lacks a truly cohesive thread, it does offer fans a taste of what Shakira is most famous for: sensational and vibrant songs.
Shakira’s Latin influences are apparent in tracks like “Addicted to  You,” which starts with the recognizable beat most commonly found in  merengue, a style of Latin American music. It is further reinforced by the instruments used—maracas and trumpets—which are the staples of the Latin style. Even the choice of language speaks to its genre, as the only phrase in English in this whole song is in the chorus, “Baby, I’m  addicted to you.” The album also has other, various types of Latin American music including reggaeton. In “Gordita,” Shakira collaborates with the band Residente Calle 13, a famous of reggaeton bands. In this way, the album orients itself towards Shakira’s Spanish audience.
“Sale el Sol” also tries to cater to those fans that love her previous, more rock infused albums like “Oral Fixation.” Through tracks like “Antes de las Seis” and “Devocion”, Shakira explores her folk and rock roots. The piano and guitar that accompany Shakira in “Antes de las Seis,” for example, bring out a different side of her vocals. Unlike “Addicted to You” and songs of that ilk, Shakira’s signature vocal style shines through aided by the different instrumentation. The more rock n’ roll songs also display more soulful, serious lyrics. “Lo que mas,” is about an overwhelming love that falls apart. The piano’s melody enhances the regret and sorrow Shakira expresses with her vocals.
However, without any smooth transitions, the album jumps to a more playful pop song, “Mariposas.” While the variety of music in the album is at times refreshing, it depreciates the album as a whole. Instead of presenting a unified theme, “Sale el Sol” seems more like a jumble of songs evoking different periods from Shakira’s career. The eclectic nature of this album does serve well for certain individual songs like “Waka Waka,” the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. In order to create an authentic anthem for the South African games, Shakira collaborated with the South African group Freshlyground. By basing the chorus off of a 1986 Cameroonian hit song, Shakira tries to stay true to the host continent while still incorporating instruments and sounds from around the world.
The first single of the album, “Loca” also stands out from the pastiche of other genres since it’s more in line with her recent, well-known singles. With a combination of Latin rhythm and rap, “Loca” has an undeniable potential for reaching a popularity the likes of “Hips Don’t Lie.” Shakira collaborates with Dizzee Rascal, a British rapper, who adds his own refreshing blend of rap and hip hop to the mix. Since the lyrics are divided more equally between English and Spanish compared to other songs in the album, “Loca” will likely be more appealing to English-speaking audiences.
On their own, the songs in “Sale el Sol” demonstrate Shakira’s diverse talents. However, her ambition to incorporate her many different styles into one album ultimately proves too distracting. The range of genres that try to please the diverse groups among her fans results in a lack of cohesion. Hopefully, “Sale el Sol” is just a stepping-stone for Shakira’s next, more focused project.

“Be prepared for indecision / It might make me disappear,” sings Steven Page, frontman of the playful Canadian alt-rock outfit Barenaked Ladies, on his debut solo album “Page One.” And how right he was—“Page One” is a schizophrenic pop revue bouncing constantly from genre to genre, but in this indecision Page’s feeling has been lost. His senses of pop and parody are as strong on this album as they have ever been, but amidst all the flashy buildup and clever laughs, he loses an air of relatable authenticity that could have (and has) made his work into great pop.
Page seizes on genre after genre to create this diverse album’s songs, fattening the record with electro-pop, jazz, epic rock, chamber pop—you name it—but many tracks carry an air of showy parody. Page has a sharp sense of the stereotypes of each genre in which he operates—the accordions of Arcade Fire wannabes, the overdramatic echoes of Maroon 5-style pop—and in each song he mashes every cliché together with paradoxical skill and abandon. Consequently, the tracks become gaudy and conspicuous, overproduced and drawing attention to their genre associations, but they are also so realistic in their parody that it’s unclear whether Page’s goal is parody or genuine experimentation.
However, his lyrics quell all doubt. In the midst of these many “influences,” Page’s deadpan delivery and flair for clever wordiness remain a constant, instilling a sense that he’s always winking to listeners and never really taking any of this seriously. “Queen of America” begins with an Owl City-reminiscent drum-and-keyboard opening, and then Page takes the lead, singing flatly, “You’re standing at the automatic door / Letting all the heat out of the store” and quickly dispelling any pop intrigue. Even one of his most straightforward pop rockers, “Marry Me,” opens with “I am a boy, and you are girl / Or so I’ve been told.” This subtle, quirky wit is straight out of Page’s work with Barenaked Ladies, but when combined here with his fat amalgamations of genre clichés, it completes the sense that these songs are masterfully overenthusiastic parodies.
That’s not to say the tracks aren’t fun morsels of pop regardless of whether they feel like parodies—standing alone, tracks including “Queen of America,” “ She’s Trying To Save Me,” “If You Love Me,” and Third Eye Blind-reminiscent standout “Indecision” prove that Page has lost none of his flair for catchy, fun song construction.
But constant parody and genre diversity has come with a price. The album is as cohesive as oil and water, and the genuineness of Page’s emotions is sometimes spoiled by his affinity for excessive song construction and wordy gimmicks. The Barenaked Ladies repertoire had a certain boldfaced honesty in its simple instrumental construction and predictable style—the emotion simply flowed, and their clever lyricism heightened the absurdity of their subjects rather than feeling contrived or consciously quirky. Indeed, Page’s best tracks on “Page One”—“Indecision” and “Marry Me”—are those which rock while shying away from overproduction, thereby drawing attention to Page’s offbeat commentaries rather than the construction of the songs themselves. Most of “Page One” loses this relatable honesty almost completely, for Page doesn’t present any clear voice amidst his mishmash of parodies, and he drowns any feelings in his work by constructing his songs conspicuously and excessively. Constantly varying from one genre to the next is fun while it lasts, but once the album finishes, there is no sense of having heard the thoughts of Page himself—merely Page appropriating voices over and over as another tool for parody. Perhaps a greater mistake is his use of such excessive production and lyrical gimmick—even his breakup ballad, “Clifton Springs,” and his earnest love song, “All The Young Monogamists,” fall prey to seeming planned and contrived. It seems as if genuine emotions are lurking somewhere in these songs, but Page hides them behind wordplay and dense, unnecessary instrumentals. The songs end up seeming like such conscious efforts of song crafting that little genuine feeling flows out.
After singing that indecision may make him disappear, Page continues, “It’s my addiction to indecision to keep me here.” And he’s right again—it’s the senseless feeling in his songs that keeps him here at the level of simple fun and parody, rather than allowing him to reach the genuine, relatable emotion that defines great pop.

Throughout April, students who have received “fat envelopes” from Harvard will flock to the campus to see if this is the place for them. In all likelihood, most of these individuals were presidents of something: their high school class, National Honor Society, or even Spanish Club, the list goes on. However, if these students choose to attend Harvard, they will quickly realize that their days of leading every club that they joined are over. In many ways, this is a good thing.
As a school, and in a larger sense as a nation, we have a leadership addiction. The application process for a school like Harvard is rigorous and fiercely competitive. In order to differentiate themselves from the pack, many students (including most of us already here) pack their resumes full of presidencies, secretariats, basically anything that could give them a little leadership experience and elevate them above “member” status. In short, purchasing upgrades for our activities helps us stand out.
This practice is fine, and pretty much unavoidable insofar as admissions offices will always see holding an office in a group as a sign of greater investment and perseverance than simply membership in that group. This opens a door for ambitious and committed students to show their drive through running for every office they can. Unfortunately, this exultation of leadership positions comes at a price.
Perhaps the greatest drawback is that everyone has, over their years as overachievers, built a strong, almost irrepressible urge to lead in everything, regardless of whether or not they would be the best for the job. This mentality often leads to an inefficient allocation of leadership positions and also the creation of many different groups with the same purpose, seemingly just for the multiplication of leadership positions. Furthermore, this leads to a proliferation of leadership-based student groups, many of which seem to feature leadership specifically for leadership’s sake.
People disagree about how effectively a leadership group can actually teach leadership, but the problem with such groups is not related to their effectiveness. Instead, the true problem with these groups is that they further compound pressure on campus to be a leader and institutionalize the idea that being simply a “member” is not enough.
The fact of the matter is, not everyone can be leaders. In fact, leaders must be the minority. There is an Afghan proverb that says, “If you think you are leading, and no one is following you, you are only taking a walk.”  At Harvard, we are emphasizing leadership so strongly that if the current leader-centric culture is carried out to its logical conclusion, it won’t be long until we are all just “taking walks.”
What we need at Harvard is a pressure to be great in whatever capacity we can be great in, and an increased value on all sorts of roles in a hierarchy.  Some people are natural- born leaders and that is what they should do.  Kudos to them, Winston Churchill did far more for his country as Prime Minister than he could have in a low- level bureaucratic job.  However, not every soldier in Britain’s army would have made a good Prime Minister.  Sometimes the greatest impact we can make is made by following.
We tend to forget that there are many ways to be useful to a group or society, most of them not at the top of the leadership ladder.  While we spend countless hours and much energy trying to turn everyone into a leader, we may well be crushing a natural and able follower’s potential to make a difference.

As the midterms draw near, candidates caught in dead-heat horseraces once again enrapture the nation. The Massachusetts race for governor is no exception, with incumbent Democratic Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 just lightly leading Republican challenger Charles D. Baker, Jr. ’79 in the polls. As it portends profound impacts for the state, this contentious race deserves the utmost consideration. In our estimation, Patrick has done a fine job as governor; we endorse the incumbent candidate because we agree with his positions on the issues that distinguish him most from his opponents, with particular attention paid to his admirable stances on energy and immigration.
We recognize the inflamed discourse against the interests of immigrants in this country; given this political climate, Governor Patrick deserves praise for resisting the pressure to adopt this rhetoric. We commend him for remaining true to his principles by including immigrants in the provision of social services like healthcare. It is here that Patrick separates himself from his opponents.
We also appreciate Patrick’s commitment to pursuing energy independence and alternative energy. He is alone in the race in his support of The Cape Wind Project and has proven over his last term that he is willing to make Massachusetts a leader in clean energy.
In addition, Patrick best recognizes the structural problems afflicting the public school system, and we believe that he is most fit to fix them going forward. The governor understands that the achievement gap is a pressing obstacle to improving the overall quality of education in the state and has taken promising steps to ameliorate this issue. We are confident that Patrick has the experience, passion, and political will not only to prioritize our children’s learning, but also to strive for the best school system possible.
Patrick is also correct to stress the need to reduce property taxes. In these bleak economic times, the finances of families across the state are understandably strained. Lower property taxes would provide much needed relief. With that said, leaders should be cognizant of the important correlation between property tax revenue and funding for public education. There exists demonstrable evidence that a substantial portion of property taxes goes to school districts; hence, any drop in property taxes must be accompanied with a concerted effort to sustain education funding.
However, none of this is to detract entirely from the other candidates in the race. In fact, Patrick would do well to incorporate some of his opponents’ positions into his own platform. In particular, we support Independent candidate Timothy P. Cahill’s plan to reauthorize the nuclear plant in Plymouth. Patrick should not hesitate to appropriate his opponents’ most sensible ideas.
Additionally, President Barack H. Obama’s recent rally for Patrick in Boston did not go unnoticed. We call on Obama to continue rallying for his fellow Democrats, especially as the election promises to hand his party near-historic losses. We find the President’s stances on education and energy mostly agreeable, and we echo his championing of health-care and financial reforms. As such, Obama remains a premier figure to galvanize Democratic support in this upcoming election. Perhaps unsurprisingly, on this issue we again find common ground with the president: namely, our endorsement of Patrick for governor of the state of Massachusetts. Come election day, it is our hope that the incumbent candidate musters the requisite votes to continue his service to the citizens of the Bay State.

In his recent e-mail to the Harvard community, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced that due to the "compressed pace of the fall semester that many of us felt this year and last," Harvard College will begin classes before Labor Day in certain years. For example, classes for the 2011-2012 academic year will start on Wednesday, Aug. 31, rather than Tuesday, Sept. 6. We applaud this calendar change for multiple reasons and are particularly pleased with the advance notice of Dean Harris's announcement, since it will allow students who must travel long distances to Cambridge sufficient time to make travel plans for the next academic year.
Ensuring that classes begin at a relatively early date will considerably reduce the stress felt by both students and staff at the College. The current calendar, which features final examinations just prior to the winter holidays, feels somewhat compressed. This is particularly stressful for many students whose midterms seem to stretch on for weeks at a time. By contrast, during the spring semester, the week-long recess allows both students and staff sufficient time to recover from the interminable block of midterm papers and exams and also creates a general structure for lecture courses and seminars alike. Considering that the fall semester would have been even shorter in the coming academic year than its current length, the adjustment seems particularly necessary.
We also hope that Harvard administrators will take the additional scheduling opportunities afforded by the lengthening of the semester to introduce more official breaks, since Harris made clear that added days will not be used for instruction. This could occur in the form of an extended Thanksgiving break or by lengthening either the Veterans' Day or Columbus Day weekends. Doing so would reduce the strain on students and staff to keep up with a relentless schedule. Midterm papers, projects, and exams could even be scheduled for immediately before the proposed Fall Break, enabling students to truly relax.
From an aesthetic perspective, starting the school year earlier also enables students to enjoy more of the beautiful weather that Cambridge offers during the summer. The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid is very fond of releasing publicity material that shows off the beauty of our campus; undergraduates deserve to experience the maximum amount of this for ourselves. Above all, however, we are very pleased to see that the College recognizes the structural problems that arose out of its recent calendar reform and are responding to student concerns in such a prompt fashion.

We’re sure standing on the National Mall in Washington D.C. on Oct. 30, listening to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert’s “Rally to Restore Sanity” would be an exhilarating experience. In fact, it might be a story we’d tell our grandchildren.
But if we were to wake up on Nov. 3 to a Congress led by the Republican Party as it currently exists, we don’t know if we could look our grandchildren in the face and be proud of our decision to attend the rally. As entertaining and memorable as standing and listening to Jon Stewart would be, we will be walking and calling and fighting for candidates who will bring some semblance of sanity back to congress.  Instead of standing in the backyard of the Capitol building, we’ll be knocking on the front doors of voters in New Hampshire.  We’ll be doing this because the midterm elections are far too important to be standing idly by, no matter how entertaining the speaker is.
The impetus for this rally is absolutely right.  Our current political climate—from Tea Party candidates who still insist that President Obama is a foreign national to the millions of dollars pouring into campaigns from advertising firms and anonymous special interests—is completely out of control.  We have gone from a system marked by enlightened discourse between relatively moderate candidates and political factions that have true, substantive ideological differences to a nationalized shouting match advocating ad hominem attacks and unrealistic policies. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert clearly understand this and want to provide like-minded individuals the opportunity to express their frustration. But merely venting frustration and laughing at the system implies that there is nothing to be done—it implies that all we can do is sit on our hands and hope that people will come to their senses.
The problem is, on this particular weekend—Get Out The Vote weekend, in which campaigns are truly decided—it is far too late for just talk. While Jon Stewart’s humor was a balm to the frustrated citizenry during the Bush administration, when there seemed to be little recourse for those who felt we had strayed from the right path, we are far from helpless at this moment.  These elections will determine whether calmer heads will prevail, or whether we will cede territory to the melodramatic ideologues who would have you believe that the legislative accomplishments of the past two years spell Armageddon. With a third of the electorate still undecided, this weekend marks a tipping point.  It is at this crucial moment that we knock on the final doors and call every last voter, driving them out to the polls to decide whether they will vote for those candidates who have remained above the fray.
For a Harvard student who is willing to sit on a bus for 10 hours each way to and from D.C., to stand in the cold on the National Mall, to watch a speck on the horizon make jokes about the insanity that has become our political process, we offer an opportunity for active, rather than passive, expression.  Board a bus with us going in the opposite direction and drive an hour to Manchester, New Hampshire. Instead of standing in the cold on the Mall, walk through a brisk fall day to canvass voters across the city.  Instead of watching a figure in the distance, talk to a real voter and join us in the warm campaign office for the break to watch the rally on television—you might actually be able to see Stewart’s and Colbert’s facial expressions!
The best way to restore sanity is not by going to Washington D.C. to watch this rally, but by going to the voters themselves. If we truly want to prevent a further national mental breakdown, we need to ensure that ideological extremists don’t gain more traction. The efforts we will put forth during Get Out The Vote weekend will help dispel the media narrative of an electorate caught between melodrama and apathy.  We can simultaneously reassert the voice of reason in the American political system, and disprove the so-called “common wisdom” which states that American youth would rather be passively entertained than actively engaged.
If we haven’t convinced you that your time would be better spent getting out the vote through face-to-face interaction, the very least you could do is to spend those 20 hours on the bus to D.C. making phone calls, sending emails and Facebook messages to anyone and everyone you know to remind them, coax them, cajole them to get out and vote on Tuesday. If, however, you have realized how much more you could do to restore sanity by actively campaigning, we encourage you reach out to any one of the partisan or non-partisan politically active groups on campus to find out what you can do this weekend. The stakes are simply too high to sit idly by.

This is the second election cycle that political junkies have had Nate R. Silver’s election models, which use reams of polling and demographic data to make predictions that proved exactly right in all Senate contests and off in only two states in the presidential race. Given that track record, Silver’s current projections do not look good for Democrats. As of this writing, Silver sees Democrats losing the House, with the GOP taking a 230 to 205 majority and keeping the Senate with a bare 52 to 48 majority.
But as fascinating as Silver’s model is, it tells us very little about why these swings are occurring. Silver’s polling and demographic data do not say much about voters’ motives, and he does not correlate his results to other factors to see what is driving voter sentiment. Luckily, there is a large literature in economics and political science tackling just this question, and its conclusions boil down to a confirmation of James Carville’s famous epigram: “It’s the economy, stupid.”
Economic models for predicting election results took off in 1978, after the publication of Yale Economics Professor Ray C. Fair’s “The Effect of Economic Events on Votes for President”. Fair has updated his model for each election since and has concluded that three economic factors can produce a reliable prediction of election outcomes: per capita economic growth, inflation, and the number of quarters during the current president’s term that per capita economic growth has topped 3.2 percent. Since Fair started making predictions, he has only missed one election, in 1992. On average, the model is off by only 2.5 percentage points. In 2008, it missed Obama’s vote share by only 1.5 points.
Applying these methods to Congressional elections is controversial, but Fair and others insist it can be done. Fair has found that the same economic factors that he uses to predict presidential elections can be used to predict on-year Congressional elections, and even fewer economic criteria are needed to predict midterms. Fair’s equation worked the last go-around, coming within a percentage point of Democrats’ actual share of the vote.
Fair’s final prediction for 2010 has yet to be released, and his model only produces a vote share estimate, not how many actual seats each party is expected to receive. However, the political scientist Douglas A. Hibbs Jr. has produced his own economic model relying on changes in disposable income rather than Fair’s three metrics and predicts that Democrats will win 211 seats and Republicans 224. This estimate is only a few seats off from Silver’s prediction, despite not using a single piece of polling data.
Some object that this way of analyzing elections is reductive and soulless. Deborah Solomon admonished Fair during an 2004 interview with him for the New York Times Magazine, saying, “It saddens me that you teach this to students at Yale, who could be thinking about society in complex and meaningful ways.” It should sadden all of us that a journalist at one of the most influential newspapers in the world thinks complexity and meaning are incompatible with social scientific rigor.
Far from making elections uninteresting, economic models, and their success, serve as evidence that voters know what they are doing.  Ensuring good economic performance is perhaps the most important task of a government. How a government handles unemployment, inflation, and wage growth has a more powerful effect on the real lives of voters than its conduct in any other policy realm. It’s perfectly rational, then, for voters to throw the bums out when the government isn’t ameliorating economic pain or to keep incumbents in office when things are going well.
Or it would be rational if the bums being thrown out of the American government were more unified. Between our bicameral legislature, our separate executive branch, the independent Federal Reserve, and the Senate’s de facto supermajority requirement, it is hard to say that the Democrats set to lose reelection are truly responsible for high unemployment. Indeed, I would argue that Senate Republicans who have blocked jobs bill after jobs bill, and forced the White House to shrink the stimulus package, bear more responsibility. What’s more, this was likely intentional. Why would Congressional Republicans support policies leading to economic growth when further stagnation would lead to gains in the next election?
Compare this to what’s happening in the U.K. now. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition has absolute control over fiscal policy and is using it to issue sweeping spending cuts and tax hikes. Governing is so easy that the coalition implemented a carbon tax almost by accident. Like many others, I doubt the cuts and hikes will work, but their effects, whatever they are, will belong solely to the governing coalition. If they fail and the coalition is booted from office due to poor economic conditions, voters’ economic motivations will serve to punish the guilty party. By giving total power to the winning party, the U.K.’s system makes that party truly accountable.
Sadly, an American parliament isn’t in the offing anytime soon. But at the very least, amending Senate rules to abolish the filibuster and eliminate “holds”—which allow a single Senator to block legislation—would give the majority more power, and thus more accountability.
If voters are going to judge Congress on economic conditions, Congress should have a greater ability to change them.

Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Lisa Albers Prock spoke yesterday about pediatrics and the impact of neglect and adoption on children.
Speaking at an event organized by Harvard China Care, a student organization dedicated to improving the lives of abandoned and orphaned children in China, Prock discussed a variety of issues concerning the adoption of Chinese-born children by American families.
Issues included psychological concerns facing both parties and unfavorable conditions in orphanages and foster care institutions.
“Being with an adoptive family that is able to provide emotional support is much better than being in an orphanage with very limited one-on-one attention,” said Prock, an attending physician at the Children’s Hospital in Boston.
Prock, an expert in developmental behavioral pediatrics who has traveled the world to examine the global adoption process, drew from anecdotal observations and specific case studies to call attention to the developmental considerations and emotional trajectory of adopted persons.
“It’s typical for children, especially older ones, to encounter feelings of loss and anxiety,” she said. “If you lose your parents once, you worry about losing them again.”
To improve the experiences of internationally and interracially adopted children, Prock highlighted the importance of sufficient preparations by the adoptive parents and their extended family prior to the adoption, as well as open discussion in the post-adoptive environment.
“The thing I wish on no child is disruptive adoption,” Prock said. “The worse thing than children remaining in orphanages is for them to join a family and then have the adoption disrupted because the family isn’t ready.”
Of the small group of attendees, several had personal experiences with adoption.
“Growing up, two of my closest friends were adopted, so it’s interesting to explore the psychology behind adoption,” said Rose Bamfo ’13.
Responding to Prock’s concern about the rampant abandonment of children in rural China, Boston College freshman Matthew Alonsozana, who also attended the event, called on the Chinese government to take action.
“Taking care of children is something China will have to improve on in order to show its commitment to social welfare,” he said.
Prock concluded the talk by reaffirming her belief in the capability of adoptive families to adequately provide for the development of children.
“Every child deserves a family and a home,” she said. “I’ll never give up hope.”

A familiar tune engaged audience members at the beginning of a seminar on happiness yesterday afternoon.
“If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands,” sang John F. Helliwell, economics professor at the University of British Columbia.
Held at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and the first in a series of Canada Program Seminars, “What Produces Happy Lives?” focused on the means of measuring a country’s success other than the GDP.
According to Helliwell, the purpose of his lecture was to argue that subjective well-being and self-assessments are “authentic measures that deserve to be taken very seriously by anyone trying to see how well a community or society works and how it might work better.”
Helliwell said that higher income does not necessarily correlate with happiness. He used graphs and charts to compare and contrast the happiness levels in the United States and in Canada, and in different regions of Canada.
Helliwell’s data, collected from surveys, demonstrated that various aspects of life besides income influence happiness, including  trust in neighbors, sense of belonging to a community, number of friends, and experience of freedom and governmental corruption.
Although U.S. residents have higher incomes, Canadian residents are happier overall, he concluded.
“We’re putting the economic way of life into a social context,” Helliwell said.
In response to questions from audience members, Helliwell discussed multiculturalism and its effects on a country’s overall happiness.
He said findings show that immigrants who keep close to their roots while also integrating into a broader community are happiest.
Their happiness, he explained, is due to their sense of belonging—and not their income.
“I give these talks to encourage people to demand to their governments that they should take this data seriously,” Helliwell said.
Polina Krass ’11, prime minister of the Canadian Club and an attendee of the seminar, said that the discussion “put a very good perspective on a lot of issues we don’t normally talk about.”
Alison K. Hill, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, agreed: “I really enjoyed it. I think this whole idea of focusing on satisfaction other than economic things is a new development,” she said.

Pink bras and tank tops embellished with statistics about breast cancer hang outside the Science Center as part of a number of events sponsored by the Harvard Cancer Society for a week dedicated to raising awareness.
In commemoration of Breast Cancer Awareness Week, members of HCS will be manning tables in Annenberg Hall and House dining halls, where students can write postcards to remind relatives of the importance of regular mammograms.
Students will also have the opportunity to trace their hands and write inspirational messages on banners that will be presented later to cancer patients in hospitals.
In addition to the week-long series of activities, members of HCS will be selling pink t-shirts and black tank tops adorned with the logo “Save Second Base” at various locations on campus. All proceeds from the shirts benefit the American Cancer Society.
HCS hopes that students will wear the shirts this Friday, a day on which people worldwide will wear pink to show their support for breast cancer awareness.
“Our aims were to promote campus discussion about breast cancer and how we as young people can support breast cancer patients and their families,” said Nina Jain ’11, co-president of HCS.
The HCS-sponsored Breast Cancer Awareness Week is part of the nationwide celebration of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which takes place every October.
HCS is not the only organization on campus to promote breast cancer awareness in recent days. Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services served cookies with pink frosting yesterday in support of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.
Athletes also showed their support. The Harvard players at last week’s Harvard-Yale volleyball game wore pink ribbons in their hair while their coaches sported pink sweaters.
Zachary J. Hofeld ’11, events co-chair of HCS, said that he was impressed by the work that this year’s members have put into making the week a success.
“I remember my freshman year here at Harvard, I don’t think there was a breast cancer awareness week, and then my sophomore year there was, but it was hardly visible,” Hofeld said. “This year we...got a group of dedicated people who were passionate about [HCS], and we all just a came together and made it happen.”
Nat J. Miller ’14, who stopped to sign his name as he was leaving Annenberg, described the banner as an easy way to show his support for breast cancer awareness.
“It took 15 seconds, and it’s a nice thing to do that didn’t take too much effort,” he said.

In a lecture yesterday about the intellectual response to the Nazi occupation of France, former New York Times correspondent Alan Riding said that French cinema, art, and literature thrived despite the occupation.
Riding promoted his new book, called “And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris,” before a crowd of academics, Cambridge residents, and students at the Barker Center. He described the responses of French intellectuals during the occupation, ranging from acceptance of the occupiers to risky work with resistance movements.
In a panel discussion with Harvard scholars, Government Professor Stanley H. Hoffmann—who lived in France during the occupation—defended French intellectuals who associated with Germans at the time, cautioning skeptics “not to generalize” about the collaborator’s motives. Hoffmann said that not all French people were fully informed throughout the occupation, and that public reception of the Germans fluctuated from acceptance to contempt.
“It is very easy to take an uppity attitude,” Hoffmann said, referring to academic reception of French intellectuals during the occupation. In turn, Riding’s work demonstrates “large levels of understanding and modesty,” Hoffmann added.
Professor of French History Patrice L.R. Higonnet ’58 agreed with Riding’s approach of using French intellectuals as a lens to analyze a broader French response to the occupation.
“[This book is] an excellent picture of the city of light during those dark years,” Higonnet said.
Riding said that he took a journalistic approach to writing his historical account. He conducted over 100 interviews and “went around looking for everyone over 90” to consult about their experiences during the occupation, he said.
“He combined serious historical research with his journalistic training, which adds a whole lot of interesting dimensions.” said Susan R. Suleiman, professor of the civilization of France.
Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Humanities Center at Harvard, praised Riding’s impartiality: “The great strength of the book was that you told it like it was,” he said to Riding.
Inez K. Hedges ’68, founder of the Program in Cinema Studies at Northeastern University who teaches a class about French cinema of the period, said that the panel discussion gave her a “whole new perspective” on the subject.

The University has entered a research collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis, a global pharmaceutical company based in Paris, to promote studies in several therapeutic areas, including cancer, diabetes, and inflammation.
As part of the agreement, Sanofi-Aventis will provide grants to fund projects proposed by Harvard researchers. In return, Sanofi-Aventis has the right to review the results of the funded projects, according to B. D. Colen, Harvard’s senior communications officer for university science.
The exact amount of money Harvard will receive to fund the projects is not being disclosed at this time, according to Colen, though he said the figure is of “significant magnitude.”
Sanofi-Aventis plans to use the new information discovered by Harvard researchers to develop new drugs and diagnostic applications.
The projects will be selected for funding by a Joint Scientific Steering Committee, composed of an equal number of representatives from Sanofi-Aventis and Harvard, according to Colen. The projects will be judged based on scientific merit and value to biomedical research.
“Collaboration between academics and industry can be beneficial for both parties,” said Steven E. Shoelson, a professor at Harvard Medical School and section head at the Joslin Diabetes Center. “On the negative side, you have to be careful in these collaborations that there are no conflicts of interest. This can be beneficial, providing appropriate steps are taken to minimize or completely alleviate any conflicts of interest.”
The new collaboration aligns with Sanofi-Aventis’ current strategy to develop new drugs in light of increased competition posed by generics, as many products are set to go off patent between 2010 and 2012.
Harvard is not the only university to partner with Sanofi-Aventis. In May, the company entered into a similar agreement with Charité University in Berlin.
Sanofi-Aventis also collaborated with an affiliated institute in Boston prior to its agreement with Harvard. The Belfer Institute for Applied Cancer Science at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute announced a collaboration with the company in September. Their work will focus on identifying oncology targets for further research to discover new anticancer drugs. Dana-Farber will receive $33 million upfront and research funding for a minimum of three years, according to a press release.
Harvard’s Office of Technology Development will also be involved in the collaboration between Sanofi-Aventis and Harvard by periodically identifying technologies that could work with the funded research projects, which Sanofi-Aventis will then evaluate.
Sanofi-Aventis will host an annual scientific forum for representatives from the company and Harvard researchers to discuss current scientific matters and review the progress of the funded research projects.

Charles D. Baker ’79 learned to love politics at a young age.
“My interest in politics came mostly from my parents,” says Baker, who is running on the Republican ticket for governor of Massachusetts.
He recalls heated discussions across the kitchen table between his father, a conservative Republican, and his mother, a lifelong Democrat—discussions in which Baker and his two brothers were expected to take part.
Baker says that he learned many lessons about politics from those dinnertime debates.
“The biggest one is that you can disagree without being disagreeable,” he says. “[My parents have] been married for 55 years, and this is going to be the first time they vote for the same person.”
FROM HARVARD COLLEGE TO HARVARD PILGRIM
Though he was born in New York, Baker spent most of his childhood in Massachusetts, aside from a stretch in Washington, D.C., while his father served in the administration of then-U.S. President Richard M. Nixon.
The family returned to Massachusetts in time for Baker to enter high school there. He traveled less than 15 miles from Needham High to Thayer Hall when he began his freshman year at Harvard in 1975.
At Harvard, Baker played for the junior varsity basketball team as a freshman and served as its assistant coach as a senior. He was part of the Delta Upsilon club—a final club which is no longer extant—and according to basketball teammate Andrew P. Buchsbaum ’79, he frequently spent time in friends’ dorm rooms listening to “head-banging rock.” Though Baker concentrated in English, he recalls being drawn toward many courses in government and social studies.
Classmates remember Baker as amiable, enthusiastic, and passionate about sports but say they did not foresee his political future.
“You would want him to be on your team because he was a go-to guy that would not give up on a play,” recalls R. Stewart Shofner ’79, who played basketball with Baker and shared a suite in Lowell House with him during their sophomore year.
“I remember Charlie as a clean-cut Massachusetts native,” says Shofner, who hails from Tennessee, “which is rare, because most of the natives that I met were either a little scraggly or way out there.”
“I wouldn’t have imagined that he’d be the classmate I’d have who’s running for governor,” Buchsbaum says. “He didn’t have that hard edge you see in some people who are really motivated to run for office.”
“I could see him going into the ministry as easy as what he’s gone into,” says Shofner. “That’s the picture I have of Charlie Baker. He’s a kind of easygoing nice guy who’s an honest fellow—a gentleman of the caliber that it’s nice to see that Harvard can produce.”
Baker—who told the Boston Globe that he chose to go to Harvard, following in his father’s footsteps, “because of the brand”—does not ascribe any credit to his education in his decision to go into politics, nor does he look back fondly on his college years.
The Globe reported that when writing to his classmates on the occasion of their fifth reunion, Baker asked, “Do I miss Harvard?” and then answered, “Not for a second. With a few exceptions...those four years are ones I would rather forget.”
Now more than 30 years since graduation, he echoes the same sentiments: “Harvard? It’s a big place,” he says. “I definitely thought about the question of where I fit the whole time I was there.”
A few years after his school years in Cambridge, Baker headed to Chicago, where he earned an MBA at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Since then, he has held a long line of positions in business and government, including Secretary of Health and Human Services and Secretary of Administration and Finance under two different Republican Mass. governors. In the latter position, he was one of the main planners of the Big Dig, a massive, controversial construction project in Boston.
Baker next ventured from government into healthcare. In 1999, he became CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a position he held for ten years before stepping down to run for governor. Harvard Pilgrim, New England’s largest not-for-profit health plan, formed from the 1994 merger of Harvard Community Health Plan—founded at Harvard Medical School—and insurer Pilgrim Health. Harvard Pilgrim still maintains ties to HMS to this day, according to Baker.
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE STATE
Baker’s background in business and health policy echoes his current calls from the campaign trail. The most important issues in this election, he says, are “jobs and the economic future of Massachusetts.”
Decrying the plight of more than 300,000 Massachusetts residents who are currently out of work, Baker criticizes his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, for not taking strong enough measures to boost the state’s economy: “I don’t think he’s been anywhere near aggressive enough in taking those issues on and dealing with them,” Baker says.
“He raised taxes eight times,” he adds. “All of that, I think, negatively affects the state’s ability to compete...Things are headed in the wrong direction, and I don’t think [Patrick] appreciates how much needs to be done to fix our competitive position.”
As the Harvard Republican Club’s vice president of campaigns and activism, Rachel L. Wagley ’11 has been leading student volunteers to Baker’s Boston headquarters to make telephone calls to voters. Wagley praises the “Baker’s Dozen,” 13 proposals which Baker promises would save the state over $1 billion.
“Massachusetts has a huge deficit and out-of-control state spending,” Wagley says, adding that Baker is “really the only candidate” who can address these issues since Patrick and Independent contender Timothy P. Cahill, who currently serves as the state treasurer, have failed to remedy these problems during their current terms.
Baker himself says Patrick hasn’t been running the capital as he should.
“[Patrick] hasn’t really done much to reform Beacon Hill,” Baker says. “It’s pretty much the same government it was when he got there four years ago.”
OUTREACH TO UNDERGRADUATES
Baker and his supporters emphasize several issues which they say should be of particular importance to students voting in this election.
“If you’re a junior or a senior, you should be focused on jobs,” Baker says.
Matthew J. Stern, a senior at Boston University who chairs the student arm of Baker’s campaign, echoes the sentiment, pointing out that the current Massachusetts economy may seem inhospitable to recent graduates.
“People are graduating and students are leaving Massachusetts,” he says. “We have the top universities...and we want to make sure that we’re keeping people here.”
Stern brings up state funding for higher education as another issue that he says should matter to student voters: “Governor Patrick has decreased higher education funding more than any other governor in the U.S.”
Stern touts Baker’s plans to increase the number of public charter schools and to uphold the state’s current standardized testing system rather than conform to new federal education guidelines.
Wagley suggests that social issues should be a selling point in convincing undergraduates to cast their ballots for Baker. In the current election, both Patrick and Baker support gay marriage and pro-choice abortion policies, according to Baker. Since he is “by no means a social conservative,” Wagley says that she thinks Harvard students should “actually like Baker for those reasons.”
Stern says that the students from Boston-area universities who fill Baker’s phone bank—more than 30 volunteers on a given Monday or Thursday night—are drawn by Baker’s stance as “a social liberal and a fiscal conservative,” not by the desire to put the volunteer activism on their resumes.
“They’re not looking for a recommendation: they’re looking for change,” Stern says. “They’re looking to make sure we’ll have an economic future that will lead to success in the state.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If this year’s senior class is anything like the class of 1975, in 35 years, over 80 percent of seniors will vote for a Democrat for president, more than 95 percent will characterize their lives as a success, and more than nine out of 10 will be happy in their relationship.
But over half will wish they could make a major life decision again, more than three-quarters will have gained weight, and around one-fifth of the class will have had an affair.
These statistics, found in a 100-question survey conducted this year of Harvard and Radcliffe students who graduated in 1975, portray a class whose members—despite some significant regrets—are largely satisfied with the current state of their lives and are optimistic about the future.
The survey garnered 240 responses ranging from the carefree to the poignant.
“I had fun along the way,” one alumnus responded when asked why he views his life as an “overall success.”
But when alumni were asked to reveal the main personal issue they confront today, they divulged more serious answers.
“I need to become brave enough to leave my husband,” wrote one alumna. Another asked, “What do I want to do with the rest of my life?”
Many of the questions were about sex, and the responses they provoked reveal a difference between the genders. The number of men who characterize sex as very important outnumber women by about 15 percent, and 14.9 percent of men have had over 30 sexual partners, compared to 12.5 percent of women.
On family life, 94.2 percent of men and 85.7 percent of women said they are happy in their current relationship.
This gender differential re-emerges in the proportion of alumni who engaged in extramarital affairs: about 17 percent of men and 24 percent of women.
Mitchell L. Dong ’75 helped organize and conduct the survey and is pushing for more standardization of class surveys. He cautioned against making any strong conclusions based on the survey results.
“The survey is filled out by happy people, not by marginalized people,” he said.
The identities of survey respondents also reveal the composition of a typical Harvard class from 35 years ago: respondents were largely male (73 percent), largely white (87 percent), and largely heterosexual (97 percent).
Dong and the other survey creators crafted 100 questions about topics ranging from religion and politics, to relationships and life satisfaction.
To those sampled, the technology boom in the 1990s was the most important event of the past 35 years, closely followed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The group was generally liberal: over 80 percent voted for Barack Obama in 2008. Not one respondent was a female Republican.
About 50 percent of alumni said that they either do not believe in God or do not know, although over 90 percent said spirituality was a force for good.
Beyond their compunctions and concerns, the alumni who responded were often hopeful about the state of their lives and their futures. Over 65 percent said that the happiest time of their lives was now or yet to come.

The International Human Rights Clinic at Harvard Law School submitted a brief in support of a petition that calls for the rehearing of a case concerning the liability of corporations responsible for human rights violations.
The amicus curiae brief supports the request that the Second Circuit court rehear Kiobel, et al. v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., et al. “en banc,” meaning that all Second Circuit judges would rule on the case, possibly overruling the three-judge panel that originally heard the appeal. The court’s ruling on Sept. 17 had rejected the premise that corporations can be held liable for violations of international human rights law under the Alien Tort Statute.
If the ruling stands, it will prevent victims of corporate human rights violations from taking legal action and leave corporations effectively unaccountable in their practices, according to Law School Clinical Instructor Susan H. Farbstein.
The Clinic—which typically submits one to three briefs a semester—filed the recent brief on behalf of professors of federal jurisdiction and legal history, who argue that the aim and precedent of the Alien Tort Statute extends jurisdiction to corporations when an alien sues for a violation.
Traditionally, U.S. law does not distinguish between citizens and corporations, according to Clinical Director Tyler R. Giannini, who is overseeing the brief with Farbstein.
“You wouldn’t want to create incentives that allow the creation of a shield,” Giannini said. “If you set up a corporation, you suddenly can’t be liable for your actions. This ruling shields corporations, and that’s very problematic.”
For the past 15 years, human rights abuse cases involving corporations have been litigated in federal courts, including the Second Circuit, according to Farbstein.
She added that the Second Circuit court’s ruling in this case has received significant attention in the human rights community. Five amicus briefs have been filed in support of a rehearing of the case.
Giannini said that the court will make a decision whether or not to rehear the case en banc by the end of this year. If the court chooses to rehear the case, it is unlikely the court will issue a decision before the end of 2011.
Law School students Stephen S. Cha-Kim, Amelia J.M. Evans, Elizabeth B. Forsyth, Benjamin Hoffman, Sandra R. Ray, and Marissa A. Vahlsing assisted in the process of submitting the brief by researching legal questions, drafting sections of the brief, and line editing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning when Massachusetts Governor Democrat Deval L. Patrick ’78 strolls into the Knights of Columbus Center in West Roxbury, Mass. for a meet-and-greet with AARP members from the neighborhood. Wearing khaki slacks, a blue button-down shirt, and a brown leather jacket, his gait is easy, and a smile lights his face.
The first African-American governor of Massachusetts, Patrick comes from the South Side of Chicago and was educated primarily in Massachusetts, at Milton Academy, Harvard College, and Harvard Law School.
Patrick is a short, attractive man. He is the sort of man with whom older women—who were moments before complaining about how he has done little to improve Social Security—want to be photographed. He is the sort of man who does the electric slide while exiting the building.
At the Knights of Columbus Center, those gathered are mindful that it is ten days before election day. A poll from the previous week shows that Patrick is five points ahead of his opponent, Charles D. Baker ’79. Pundits say the G.O.P. is poised to take the U.S. House of Representatives, if not the Senate.
Two years ago, Massachusetts was a powerhouse of support for U.S. President Barack Obama. Earlier this year, however, the state elected Scott P. Brown, a Republican, as its newest senator. National disappointment with Democratic leadership appears to be running high.
But Patrick, who is fighting to defend his incumbent position as governor, appeals to the room of senior citizens, asking them to allow him to finish his work begun in his first term, which centered around public education, health care coverage, and job creation during a time of economic crisis.
EDUCATING A GOVERNOR
Those who have known him the longest say that they always recognized Patrick’s leadership potential.
“I could see a great future for him,” says Sondra J. Brigandi, Patrick’s neighbor from the South Side of Chicago who has known him since he was seven years old.
In 1970, Patrick, who was born two years after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, landed a spot at the elite Milton Academy, thanks to a program called “A Better Chance” that helps send gifted students of color to top schools.
At a time when the wound of racism stung the nation, Patrick impressed his classmates as a “consensus builder” who sought to bridge racial divides.
“Patrick made friends very easily and across all kinds of boundaries,” says Daniel Gregory, a Milton friend who has financially supported Patrick’s governorship campaign. “He brought people together, no matter what race you were, what religion you were.”
George Chase, another Milton classmate, says that the “very sincere” and “very genuine” attitude Patrick had when talking with other people may be one reason why “everyone liked him [and] respected him.”
What Patrick has done as governor in the past four years “reflects the personality he had in high school, which was his patience,” says Chase, who adds that he had seen Patrick’s potential. “He always seemed like someone who had incredibly high ambition...He was always serious about what he was trying to accomplish.”
From Milton, Patrick went on to Harvard, where the English concentrator continued to win over friends among both faculty and students with his amiable character.
“I had some amazing teachers, and in particular the House Masters at Dunster House,” Patrick says, referring to James Vorenberg and his wife. “The two of them were my parents and have remained so until he passed away.”
For Charles W. Breaux, Jr. ’78, Patrick’s four-year roommate in Holworthy and Dunster, the candidate’s character was an early sign of a successful political career: “For a moment I thought he was to become the first Black president,” Breaux says.
Breaux remembers the young Patrick as a personal friend who cooked well, beat him at squash, and drank beer with him in their job as bartenders for Harvard Student Agencies.
Since Patrick did not come from a wealthy family, he had to take different kinds of “weird jobs” to support himself, according to Breaux.
The two once signed up to work for a traffic flow study, that required them to wake up at 6 a.m., go to the designated spot along highways outside Boston, and count cars while listening to jazz and drinking hot coffee grabbed from a Dunkin’ Donuts in Central Square.
Despite his rise to power, Patrick has remained unchanged at his core, his friends say.
“He brings his past forward with him,” Gregory says, citing an instance when Patrick named his dog after one of his teachers at Milton.
What has changed is that “he’s learnt to hone his skills to work on behalf of his people,” says Anna L. Waring, a Milton classmate and longtime friend.
GENERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
Looking out at a mostly white-haired crowd in West Roxbury, with The Temptations crooning “My Girl” in the background, Patrick speaks of what he calls generational responsibility. He references the ways in which he believes the Baby Boomers have failed to live up to the standards of their parents’ generation, which fought in World War II, created the social safety net in America, and launched the Civil Rights movement.
“That whole idea of generational responsibility, that each of us in our time is supposed to do what we can to make it better for those who come behind us, has been missing I think from our commerce, from our governing for a long time now,” Patrick says. “And we’re trying to bring that back. We’re trying to model the lesson you taught us about generational responsibility.”
For Patrick, generational responsibility means investing in public education, health care, and job creation.
“It’s about finishing what we started,” he says.
He references Massachusetts as the state that leads in student achievement due to his education reform, which involved making it easier to shut down failing schools, encouraging innovation in education, increasing access to charter schools in poorly performing districts, and spearheading a campaign to close the achievement gap.
Patrick also wants to make the public option for health care more affordable in Massachusetts, which has become a national model for public health care, boasting a 97.5-percent insurance rate.
A third element of Patrick’s platform is job creation in the state in this time of economic crisis. Massachusetts is currently the second-leading state in terms of economic growth, according to Patrick, in part, he says, due to local job creation programs.
KEEP HOPE ALIVE?
Patrick was the dark horse candidate in 2006, and despite a grim national outlook, he refutes claims that there is a pervasive sense of disappointment with the Democratic Party.
“I think that I hear that from pundits and pollsters, but if I’d listened to pundits and pollsters four years ago, I wouldn’t be in this job,” Patrick says. “I think that what is at stake in this election is a choice of values, whether we’re going to be about generational responsibility or whether we’re going to return to the slogans and cliches that sound good but frankly are the reason we are in this national economic mess to begin with.”
Boston Mayor Democrat Thomas M. Menino is also campaigning for Patrick, but his endorsement on Saturday morning is measured.
“For some of us who are married, do you always agree with your husband or wife?” Menino asks the audience. “I don’t either. Same with the governor, we don’t always agree with him either, right? But you know something? He’s the best thing we have. He cares about you.”
Patrick has not shied away from negative campaigning.
“Charlie Baker’s answer to unemployment is to put 5,000 more people out of work and to push 12,000 people off of unemployment insurance benefits in this economy, and I’m not making it up,” Patrick says. “I think we can do better than that because I think we are better than that.”
But Patrick’s goal is still fundamentally the same as it was in his Milton days. In a response to a question about race, he says that he seeks to unify, not divide.
“What I’m focusing on is how we lift everybody,” Patrick says, “not how we tear each other down, not what our differences are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A majority of the City Council expressed its disapproval yesterday of the financial backing of the group Save Our Skyline, which was recently revealed to be funded by wealthy long-time Cambridge resident Phillip T. “Terry” Ragon.
Save Our Skyline is currently seeking to repeal an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance passed by the Council in late September. The amendment, according to the group, allows “a proliferation of unwanted corporate signs” along the Charles River, according to the coalition’s spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman.
Save Our Skyline collected 11,461 signatures on a petition certified Oct. 20—more than the 12 percent of registered voters needed to force the City Council to reconsider the amendment. If the Council does not rescind it within a 20-day waiting period, the issue will be put on the ballot for elections in 2011.
Ragon, the funder of the petitioning efforts, is a 30-year resident of Cambridge and the CEO and founder of InterSystems, which is located in Cambridge. Ragon is financially backing the issue “because he cares deeply as a citizen,” Schwartzman said.
But City Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves expressed his alarm at the disclosure of Ragon’s involvement.
“It is an attempt to overrun the government by someone who has a lot of money,” he said. “This is no innocent stuff...The people are not for sale.”
Cambridge’s highest official spoke for the majority when he condemned Save Our Skyline’s methods. City Mayor David P. Maher called the group’s efforts “a deliberate campaign to mislead the people. And it worked.”
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey said Save Our Skyline’s petitioners have been misinforming the public by suggesting that the Council is “out to destroy the river” and voted on the amendment in an environment of secrecy. The coalition’s petition was not conducted in a clear and impartial manner, Toomey said, and the effort seemed “well-orchestrated and well-paid.”
“If people are turning to the Globe and Cambridge Chronicle, then they are not getting the whole truth,” Reeves said.
For her part, Councillor Marjorie C. Decker tried to dispel the distortions surrounding the amendment’s effect on signs along the Charles River: “We did not relax regulations,” she said. “There were no regulations.”
Schwartzman countered by stating that it is “insulting” to the people of Cambridge that some councillors are assuming that the public is misinformed.
“The most important thing that we were able to do was educate the citizens,” she said of the petitioners.
Councillor Craig A. Kelly was the lone voice on the Council to agree with Schwartzman. Defending Save Our Skyline, he pointed out that Ragon’s funding of the petition effort was not fundamentally different from other political campaigns.
“I don’t think the money that was put in it makes the people who signed it either wrong or ill-informed. They are neither,” Kelly said. “We are doing a disservice to many of the people.”
The Council voted to ask City Manager Robert W. Healy to find more information on the issue of the amendment in the coming week.

As the saying goes, “Money can’t buy happiness.” But according to a new study co-authored by Psychology Professor Daniel T. Gilbert, that traditional belief may not be entirely true.
The as-yet-unpublished study—written with Elizabeth W. Dunn ’99 of the University of British Columbia and Timothy D. Wilson of the University of Virginia—argues that most people can purchase happiness, but they are terrible at gauging what will provide them with the greatest satisfaction. People ultimately spend money on “all the wrong things,” the study claims.
“Money is an opportunity for happiness,” Dunn told a British Columbia newspaper, “but it is an opportunity that people routinely squander because the things they think will make them happy often don’t.”
The general understanding over recent years has been that money is capable of purchasing happiness up to a certain extent, given that some sources of happiness are not for sale. But the new study challenges this viewpoint by arguing that “money can buy many, if not most, if not all of the things that make people happy.”
Scientific reasons lie behind peoples’ inability to derive happiness from money, according to the study. Most people do not understand basic scientific facts about happiness, about what creates and sustains it, and they consequently do not spend money in ways that optimize their happiness.
To illustrate this point, the report assesses various decision-making processes that individuals undertake to maximize their happiness.
For instance, the study cites the use of the website Bizrate.com to compare the costs of goods. While the site allows consumers to compare prices and make the best possible decision for themselves financially, the professors argue that making choices based upon price may not maximize happiness.
“Comparison shopping may sometimes come at a cost,” the study said.
The paper also considers the decisions of Harvard students, who base their Housing preferences on factors that they do not necessarily consider the most important.
When first-year students were asked to determine the feature most important for their happiness in their assigned upperclassman House, the students cited social life, community, and relationships with roommates as the foremost factors. But immediately before Housing Day, students instead placed a much higher emphasis on the physical features of each House.
“Because students focused excessively on highly variable features of the houses, they fell victim to the impact bias, overestimating how happy they would be living in the physically desirable houses and how miserable they would be living in the less desirable houses,” the study stated.
The three co-writers were not available for comment yesterday.

Homophobia and anti-abortion sentiments are increasingly associated with evangelical Protestantism, causing young adults to turn away from religion, according to Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert D. Putnam and Notre Dame Associate Professor David E. Campbell.
In “Walking Away From Church,” an editorial published on Oct. 17 in the Los Angeles Times, Putnam and Campbell posited that though many people under 30 believe in God, they are turning away from organized religion because of its “increasing identification with conservative politics.”
The two scholars expanded upon their arguments in one part of their new book “American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us,” published earlier this month. The work explores religious diversity in America, the religious devotion of its citizens, and the tension raised by the emergence of the religious right in recent decades.
According to Putnam and Campbell, the link between Christianity and conservative politics strengthened in the 1980s when both politics and religion grew increasingly polarized.
“Some people who are themselves involved in the religious right don’t necessarily want to hear this,” said Campbell—who earned his Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2002—of the public’s reaction to the LA Times editorial. But the authors said that they received positive feedback from both religious and secular readers.
April M. Van Buren ’12, who comes from a family of evangelical Protestants, said that she agreed with the editorial’s authors. The association of evangelical Protestantism with conservative ideas prompted her to shift to a more agnostic point of view when she came to Harvard, she said.
Nathan J. Nakatsuka ’12, president of the leadership team of Harvard College Faith and Action, shares Van Buren’s perspective: “There are probably many reasons why young adults are turning away from the Church, and a reaction against the ‘Religious Right’ is often a large factor,” he wrote in an e-mail.
Reverend Robert J. Mark of Memorial Church is also among the Protestants who agree with Putnam and Campbell. Harvard students, Mark said, have increasingly turned away from the more “traditional,” Christian way of expressing their faith since the 1960s to join a wider range of spiritual movements. He agreed that the shift was probably due to the fact that evangelical Protestantism is increasingly associated with conservative politics.
While many evangelical Protestants argue against same-sex marriage and abortion, they are not speaking for all Christians, according to Reverend Donald S. Larsen, president of the Harvard Chaplains. He warned against jumping to general conclusions about Christianity.
“[Evangelical Protestantism] is a small piece of the religion pie,” said Larsen, adding that his particular denomination does in fact recognize committed same-sex relationships.

Perseverance proved triumphant last night as the Harvard women’s soccer team grinded down Quinnipiac to win a late-night nail-biter, 1-0, in double-overtime.
After blasting its way back into Ivy League title contention with a 4-0 win over the weekend, the Crimson (7-6-1, 3-2-0 Ivy) hosted the Bobcats (5-7-3) last night in the final nonconference game of its season at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium. Harvard hoped to use yesterday’s match as a tune-up before the final leg of the Ancient Eight season.
Despite coming off just two-days rest, the Crimson nonetheless displayed a high level of tenacity and efficiency on both sides of the ball.
The Harvard frontline totaled 31 shots—11 on goal—in addition to 14 corner kicks, while the backline held the Bobcats to only four shots throughout the game.
But even in the face of these glowing statistics, the Crimson proved unable to convert its numerous scoring opportunities into actual goals until sophomore midfielder Alexandra Conigliaro sealed the deal in the 101st minute.
“We just have to give Quinnipiac a lot of credit,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said.  “They were really good at what they were trying to do, and we just had to be patient and not try to give the ball away at bad spots, which we did a few times in the first half.”
The Bobcats began the match with a shot only two minutes into play from Quinnipiac defender Kyla Miles, forcing sophomore goalkeeper AJ Millet to make an early save.
But this early attempt on goal proved to be the only meaningful scoring opportunity by the Bobcats throughout the game. Following this early and rare defensive slip-up, the Crimson backline was determined to keep any threats at bay, holding Quinnipiac to only three shots over the remainder of the contest.
With the defense solidified, the home team was enabled to dominate offensively, turning the game into a one-sided affair, which was predominantly played on the Bobcat side of the field.
“We started out slow,” sophomore defender Taryn Kurcz said. “At first we weren’t playing our game, we were playing into the game plan of Quinnipiac, but in the second half we started to play good soccer. We had our chances; we even scored one that was called offside.“
In the 84th minute of play, Harvard appeared to have finally taken the lead as Conigliaro deftly fired a close-range shot into the upper reaches of the net. But the goal was taken away after it was ruled that Conigliaro had received a pass from an offside Crimson striker.
The play proved to be one of many frustratingly close calls Harvard faced throughout much of the game, particularly in the second half.
Finally, after nearly 102 minutes of play, co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh broke away from the midfield in a run down the sideline. As she neared the Quinnipiac goal, Sheeleigh cut away from a Bobcat defender and fired a cross along the ground that inexplicably threaded its way through three other players before it found the feet of Conigliaro.
After one touch to settle the ball, Conigliaro blasted it beyond the diving Quinnipiac keeper to earn the dramatic golden-goal winner, just as rain began to fall on Soldiers Field.
Though the Crimson’s win last night will ultimately have little significance in the context of the Ivy League championship race, the team saw it as a good warm up for upcoming Ancient Eight play.
“The Ivies are a whole different thing,” Leone said. “Every game is its own thing, so right now it’s all about playing more games together, considering that we don’t play that many throughout the season anyways.”
As the Crimson prepares for its matchup against Dartmouth this coming Saturday, what remains clear is that Harvard, in the span of three short games, has kept itself in the hunt for the title.
“Obviously this win helps to strengthen our confidence,” Kurcz said. “It was good that we picked it up in the second half and also in overtime, but we have to make sure that we don’t do that against Dartmouth on Saturday. We have to win it in 90 minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering this weekend’s ITA Northeast Regional Championships in Hanover, N.H., tennis junior co-captain Holly Cao had no reason to doubt her ability to post another top performance.  As the tournament’s third seed and defending champion, she seemed poised to recapture the singles title. But Cao refused to get bogged down in history, approaching this tournament as any other.
“I didn’t really think about [my performance here last year],” Cao said. “I just wanted to play well, enjoy the tournament, and see where that took me.”
The junior, who holds a 7-2 record in the singles slot so far this season, got off to a dominating start. In the round of 64, Cao handily defeated Stony Brook’s Aylin Mehter, 6-0, 6-2.
She followed this win up with a decisive 6-0, 6-1 victory over Rutgers’ Jennifer Holzberg in the round of 32. Cao then closed out the round of 16, topping rival Yale’s Elizabeth Epstein, 6-0, 3-6, 6-4.
But it was the tournament quarterfinals yesterday that served up an unexpected ball.
During the Saturday’s doubles match with co-captain Samantha Rosekrans, Cao rolled her ankle, an injury that would eventually force her to withdraw from the next match-up against Dartmouth’s Molly Scott.
“I think I twisted my ankle, but I thought it would be fine,” Cao said. “So I played the next singles match. But during [the quarterfinal], it started bothering me a bit, and after speaking to my coach, we decided the best thing would be for me to pull out.”
The ITA Championships main singles draw, which saw action from four other Harvard players, was not without its highlights. Sophomore Kristin Norton, ranked ninth in the tournament, advanced to the round of 16. Norton first coasted to a 6-1, 6-4 win over Rhode Island’s Pam Emery. In the round of 32, she bounced back from a 4-6 first set loss to 6-4, 7-5 wins in the second and third sets.
“Kristin played a great [round of 32] match,” Cao said. “She was tired that morning from her previous match, so she got off to a slower than normal start. It was very close, and she just stuck with it to the finish.”
The ITA Championships’ sixth-ranked Anna Edelman of Binghamton University would end Norton’s bid to the next phase of the tournament with a 6-0, 6-4 victory.
Rosekrans reached the round of 32, moving past Boston University’s Leonie Athanasiadis, who retired due to injury. She then fell to Boston College’s sophomore Alex Kelleher, 6-2, 6-0.
In doubles play, Cao and Rosekrans swept Seton Hall’s Rocio Portela and Pui Wing, 8-0, on their way to the round of 16. The Crimson captain duo was ultimately defeated in an Ivy League face-off against a strong Columbia team of Bianca Sanon and Nicole Bartnik, 8-5.
The Harvard pairings of sophomores Norton and Tachibana and freshmen Natalie Blosser and Hannah Morrill each dropped the opening round of the doubles draw to UMass and Penn, respectively.
“There were a lot of nerves from the freshmen, and that’s normal,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “You have to learn to get over those. There’s a really high learning curve involved, and this was a great experience for them.”
The team has this upcoming weekend to re-group until it rounds out the fall season right here in Cambridge at the Harvard Invitational on Nov. 5.
“Right now, a couple of our players are dinged up,” Green said. “This is a chance for us to rest. We’ve been giving too many points away instead of letting the other teams win them outright, so that’s something we need to improve on before the Invitational.”
With the fall season rapidly drawing to a close, the Crimson now has a keen sense of its competition—and what it’s going to take to stage a strong turnaround in the spring.
“It’s a very exciting time to be playing in the Ivy League,” Green said. “The competition is very tough. All the schools have improved tremendously due to both training and recruiting. It’s really anybody’s game at this point. We just have to keep our goals in mind for the rest of the semester.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Building on last weekend’s victory at the Captain Hurst Bowl Regatta, the Harvard sailing team continued to execute at three regattas over the weekend. The Sherman Hoyt and Oberg Trophies tested the Crimson’s mettle while the Women’s Stu Nelson Trophy was ideal preparation for an upcoming event.
“The weekend went pretty well overall,” junior crew Alexandra Jumper said. “[Nelson trophy] was an important regatta for us to get ready for ACC qualifiers next weekend.”
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
The Crimson participated at Brown’s intersectional regatta and fared well against a pool of 18 squads. Although poor winds on Sunday cut the weekend-long event short, Harvard’s strong performance on Saturday placed the group third behind first-place Boston College and Roger Williams. Brown and Dartmouth—dominant on the Charles in the Oberg Trophy—didn’t match that performance in Providence, slipping to sixth and seventh, respectively.
“I think we sailed well in both divisions this weekend,” senior skipper Alan Palmer said.  “It was kind of puffy and shifty on Saturday with lots of wind, and I think we were able to sail well in those conditions.”
In the A division, Palmer and senior crew Meghan Wareham cruised to top-10 finishes in all eight races of their set to secure third place. The pair trailed only the Eagles and the Hawks, the winners and runners-up, respectively.
In the B division, co-captain Tedd Himler and sophomore Alma Lafler navigated a six-race set to capture sixth place on the scoreboard. The pair posted three top-four finishes and ended behind the third-place Bears by only 13 points.
“It was a really good regatta to do well at because all of the best teams in New England had all of their best pairs there,” Palmer said. “We haven’t been able to sail against a field like that yet this season.  For us to pretty solidly get third this weekend is a good sign as we get ready for the Schell Trophy regatta next weekend, which serves as the qualifier for ACCs, the most important regatta of the fall for us.”
WOMEN’S STU NELSON TROPHY
Down at Connecticut College, an all-female Crimson contingent also performed well at the intersectional regatta. Home field advantage gave the Camels the edge as they left the weekend victorious, but Harvard sailed well in the field of 18 teams, finishing in sixth place.
Junior captain and skipper Emily Lambert and Jumper sailed in the A division and landed five top-10 finishes en route to a fifth place slot on the scoreboard.
Freshman Caitlin Watson and junior Marie Appel landed in 12th place in the B division.
“[Watson] did a nice job in the B division, and Emily and I were fairly happy about how we did in the A division,” Jumper said of the weekend. “But, we know that there are some things we can work on. We need to keep capitalizing on all of the work we have been putting in during practice and all of the regattas on the weekends.”
The regatta also served as good preparation—the team will be returning to the same site on the Connecticut River next weekend for the ACC qualifiers.
OBERG TROPHY
Although much of the buzz on the Charles River this weekend focused on the Head of the Charles, the Crimson hit the water as well at MIT’s weekend-long conference regatta. Over the 30-race event, two Protests resulted in disqualifications for Coast Guard and Salve Regina, while Harvard received a Redress.
Brown, landing at the top of the scoreboard by a margin of 50 points, took home the trophy, and fellow Ivy League squad Dartmouth placed second. MIT performed well on its own turf as well, nabbing third place for the top Greater Boston team finish. The Crimson wrapped up the regatta 12 out of 18 teams.
In the A division, juniors Brendan Kopp and William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, sailed to seven top-five finishes, including a first-place sixth race. The pair amassed 53 points, a performance that beat out the Bears and the Big Green for first place.
But the teams competing in the B and C divisions weren’t as successful. Senior Colin Santangelo and sophomore Sarah McCuskee finished 15th in the B division, and sophomores Nick Waldo and Jinyan Zang sailed to 16th place in the C division.
MIDWEEK TECH INVITATIONAL
Last Tuesday at MIT’s fourth Midweek Tech Regatta, rookie Harvard sailors got a chance to get on the water. Ames Lyman and Diana Powell finished 11th, Luke O’Connor and Sarah Pierson captured 12th, and Ben Lamont and Kathryn Kelly rounded out the group in 13th place.
Junior Grant Wonders and sophomore Chris Lee finished in 22nd place.

Across campus, students are donning their capes and polishing their broomsticks—not for Halloween—but for the opening of the much-anticipated seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter movie series. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” debuts on Nov. 19 in theaters. For those itching to dress as Harry or Hermione long before then, the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH) will be hosting Potter-themed festivities over the next few weeks.
On Oct. 30 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., students are invited to come to HMNH dressed as their favorite Harry Potter character and essentially experience Hogwarts in real life. Different stations are placed throughout this magical school of witchcraft and wizardry: Magical Creatures, Wizardly Wands, Life’s Secrets, and Potter’s Potions, where participants can even make their own concoctions.
From Oct. 30 through Nov. 28, the museum will also offer a Harry Potter Scavenger Hunt, featuring specimens “from wolves to wolfsbane and snakes to snowy owls,” according to an HMNH poster.
Best of all, the events are both free for Harvard students—the only thing we love more than wearing costumes.
