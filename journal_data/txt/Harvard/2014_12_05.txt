After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As national student loan debt soars past the trillion-dollar mark, “Ivory Tower” reveals the rapidly increasing college tuition costs in the U.S. and explores the implications of the issue, including the value of a college education. Directed and produced by Andrew R. Rossi HLS ’98, the CNN documentary examines elements of the American higher education system at all levels: college infrastructure, student attitudes, and domestic political and economic trends in the United States. While at times the organization of the film seems to be a little incohesive, its ultimate strength is that it achieves its purpose: to make the public ponder and question the institution of college in America and perhaps work towards a solution.
The film opens with a history of the four-year residential college, starting with Harvard University, the model after which most American colleges have been fashioned. But this concept, which is so familiar to so many Americans, is questioned by Stanford University professor Mitchell Stevens, who states that four-year residential colleges are “extraordinarily effective yet inefficient.” His evidence? A trillion dollars in student loan debt and disproportionate inflation of tuition since 1978. As shown in a shocking graph, college has become 1,120% more expensive, while food prices have only inflated by 244%.
Many of the problems featured in “Ivory Tower” are caused by irresponsibility, with both colleges and students at fault. The most striking one is the creation of “party pathways”: some schools cater to students by creating environments not for learning but for partying. In one of the most compelling sequences of the documentary, interviews with authors, professors, and even concerned students who condemn prioritizing partying over studying are interwoven with clips of the debauchery itself. The issue is ultimately one of cultural attitudes: too many students value partying over an actual education, and colleges support their poor value systems. Worst of all, it doesn’t seem like change will happen anytime soon—the president of Arizona State University, an infamous “party school,” seemed totally nonchalant about encouraging students to focus more on academics in an interview.
The perceived waste and excess don’t stop there. In a striking montage, “Ivory Tower” depicts the luxury facilities that students now demand, such as rock climbing walls and tanning beds. In response, colleges build aimlessly in an “arms race” of infrastructure at the students’ cost. Woven into “Ivory Tower” are shots of the Cooper Union, a design school in New York City founded upon the premise that students receive full scholarships. The college borrowed too extensively to construct a new $175 million engineering building that it could not afford and ran a significant deficit. Ultimately, the school began charging tuition, sparking a two-month-long student occupation of the Office of the President. This ordeal was one of the most compelling and engaging arcs of the film, and although the students ultimately failed to achieve their original goal, their endeavors added a much-needed inspiring and uplifting aspect to a film meant to criticize current society.
“Ivory Tower” also explores another question: if traditional college is so expensive, why do we need it at all? In fact, attending college has both a monetary cost and an opportunity cost of time. There are indeed alternatives, including a fellowship from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, which pays highly qualified young entrepreneurs $100,000 to drop out of college to work on a research project, foundation, or startup. On the other side of the spectrum, Deep Springs College is a unique two-year program that interweaves tough manual labor with a strong education based in philosophy and morality. But despite their strong merits, the problem with these sorts of programs is their limited range—few students have the right personality traits and qualifications to pursue education in these alternative formats, and even fewer are willing to take a chance on them.
After exploring all of these ideas in rapid succession, it’s not immediately clear which solution to the higher education crisis “Ivory Tower” argues for. The documentary asserts that the most fulfilling sort of education is the traditional liberal arts system, but it’s only offered by the best of schools and appreciated by the most motivated students. Even then, as conceded by Wesleyan College President Michael S. Roth, there is no guarantee of solid employment. Free education in the United States is purely a pipe dream, as shown by the troubled Cooper Union. And not attending college certainly might be possible for some but definitely not for an “average” student. The future seems grim with no solution in sight.
But that’s precisely the strength of “Ivory Tower.” All of the parties—students, colleges, legislators—are responsible in some way for the predicament into which college students are thrown headfirst. No one party can individually effect a better higher education system: any change that can occur must be a collective shift of attitude in all of society. This can only occur with widespread public awareness and concern regarding the college tuition crisis. And in that regard, the thought-provoking open-endedness of “Ivory Tower” is extremely effective, if a bit roundabout. It’s exactly what America needs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Insanity and helplessness abound in “The Homesman,” a Western that sends a clear message—America’s harsh and unforgiving frontier is not for the faint of heart.
Set in mid-19th-century Nebraska, the film centers on two individuals—Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank), an unmarried, middle-aged woman who has both financial security and the respect of her community but is “too plain,” and George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), an unscrupulous frontiersman who illegally works another man’s claim.
Spurned by yet another potential husband, Cuddy volunteers for the formidable task of returning three mentally ill wives home to Iowa, almost exclusively a man’s job. She enlists the help of Briggs after agreeing to save him from being lynched. The ensuing journey is harsh and unforgiving as the desert relentlessly erodes the will and sanity of the two protagonists. As Reverend Dowd (John Lithgow) says, “People like to talk about death and taxes, but when it comes to crazy, they stay hushed up.”
“The Homesman” is blessed with a wealth of fabulous performances. Hilary Swank is spellbinding as the selfless Cuddy—an unshakeable and headstrong guardian angel who never found someone to love her but was is nevertheless determined to devote herself to others. This is a role that few other than Swank could have executed so effortlessly. Jones, who has made a name playing eccentric roles, is also to be commended for his nuanced depiction of an archetype. The supporting cast is a who’s who of character actors, including John Lithgow, James Spader, William Fichtner, and Jesse Plemons. Someone by the name of Meryl Streep also drops by.
The film also effectively captures the distinct Western ambience. For that, Jones, who doubles as director, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, and composer Marco Beltrami are to thank. Prieto, who has gained wide acclaim for the photography in “Brokeback Mountain,” “Babel,” and “The Wolf of Wall Street,” recreates the lifeless and colorless desert without which the film could not exist. This stark atmosphere is compounded by an adept scoring job by Beltrami that consists mostly of wistful strings and hollow winds, all of which make for a bare and pure frontier sound.
Unfortunately, “The Homesman” rests on a clichéd story which, in attempting to distinguish itself, becomes a convoluted, confused mess. The film begins unequivocally as the tale of a woman so consumed by a sense of helplessness that she becomes selfless to the point of self-destruction. With Cuddy as the focal point, this would have been a more affecting and heartbreaking story. Instead, “The Homesman” shifts emphasis midway to Briggs and all of a sudden the film becomes a run-of-the-mill reformed convict narrative. We see Briggs soften as he learns to care for the three insane women, and when a turn of events gives him the opportunity to simply abandon the quest, he pushes onward regardless and delivers on his word. A maverick with no respect for the law is saved by an empathetic woman and gradually learns to abandon his selfish ways—been there, done that.
The film ends on a bewildering note that is excruciatingly unsatisfying. In a film where hopelessness is a major motif, it seems unfair to expect a clean, happy conclusion. Even the most tragic films, however, can provide some kind of catharsis. “The Homesman” could have closed with healing or with relapse but chooses instead to follow neither path. Will George Briggs continue to be the better man that Mary Bee Cuddy has inspired him to be? The film does not seem to care and the final minutes weave layer upon layer of frustrating misdirection. The credits roll as George Briggs dances drunk on a boat, shooting his pistol randomly into the distance.
“The Homesman” is wonderful on paper, and it’s certainly not terrible. Headlined by two Oscar winners and tackling some dark subject matter, there is no reason it shouldn’t have lived up to Jones’s last Western, the highly acclaimed “No Country for Old Men.” In the end, the film’s potential only makes its flaws more unbearable as the audience wonders what could have been.

Flat abs. A trendy source of stress relief. An alternative to pumping metal or pounding the treadmill. These rather uninspiring terms are likely the first (or only) words that come to mind when one thinks of yoga. “Awake: The Life of Yogananda”, a new indie movie directed by Paola di Florio and Lisa Leeman, gives even the most disillusioned or skeptical American a chance to discover the true identity and spiritual significance of this several-thousand-year-old Asian tradition through an overview of the life of the man who brought yoga to America, the guru and master yogi Paramahansa Yogananda.
The movie combines video and audio of Yogananda with multiple interviews of yoga enthusiasts as wide-ranging as a New York Yankees fan off the street to the late George Harrison himself. Part documentary, part biography, “Awake” is a kinetic collage that uses Yogananda’s story to depict yoga’s inspiring, spiritual origins as well as its influence on society, business, and technology today—one that reminds the audience of yoga’s ongoing relevance in America nearly 100 years after it took root in the country during the mid-19th century.
The film’s patchwork-like visuals temper the profound and poetic essence of yoga with down-to-earth depictions of its extensive influence in 21st-century American culture. The movie starts and ends in a hypnotizing juxtaposition of Yogananda’s soothing voice with abstract compositions of rolling waves and wavering psychedelic beams of light. These scenes enable the viewer to physically feel the effects of yoga, such as going beyond one’s human finitude to the common spirit that Yogananda believed unites all people, regardless of religion.
The film develops its historical narrative through photographs and brief footage of Yogananda and the areas that he visited or founded. These disparate images explain the gradual spread of yoga, from Yogananda’s 1920 speech in America at the Congress of Religious Liberals, where he shocked the populace by talking about the possibility of forming a personal connection to God, to the founding of the “Self-Realization Fellowship” in Mount Washington, Los Angeles that same year as the locus of the first spiritual community of his followers, to the astounding annual “Solstice in Times Square” event, in which innumerable yoga enthusiasts take over Times Square to attempt to find tranquility at the world’s most frenzied place.
The fragmented quality of the film’s historical narrative allows moments of poetic and visual explorations of a yogi’s philosophy to appear between the factual photographs and videos. These brief interludes of profound yoga theory and lyricism give the viewer a physical experience of the historical narrative. This fluidity between knowledge and experience provides a convincing taste of the yoga that Yogananda taught to his Western students.
In a particularly striking example, one of the movie’s closing lines, “Life and death are like waves of the sea—I am an ocean of consciousness,” is given a powerful tangible presence through the footage of a wave crashing into a void: the wave’s inability to meet a physical barrier artfully captures the boundlessness that results from connecting one’s consciousness to the common spirit that animates all of humanity. The ocean imagery at the end also echoes the movie’s opening image, an “infant” Yogananda swimming in the amniotic fluid. This cyclic nature of the movie’s imagery captures the spiritual infinity of yoga.
But the movie does not lose the viewer in this meditative mélange of visual abstraction and inspirational quotes. In fact, 3D diagrams analyzing the biological effects of yoga on the human body also appear throughout the historical narrative. For instance, one such diagram tracks the changes in brain activity that result from meditation, validating Yogananda’s description of his own philosophy as “the science of self-realization.” As Andrew Newberg, doctor and author of “How God Changes Your Brain,” put it: “We see a very substantial decrease in activity in the part of the brain that normally helps create a sense of our self and of our orientation in space and time…. You block your ability to establish your sense of self as distinct…and…begin to feel that sense of deep connectedness and oneness with the rest of the world.”
The movie even goes so far as to assert that Yogananda’s doctrine set a precedent for explaining a phenomenon that would be coined 50 years later: neuroplasticity. The yogi believed that the elimination of bad habits could be achieved through contemplation of one’s inner consciousness, similar to how scientists today explain neuroplasticity and brain behavior.
Such divulgences of yoga’s effects on human spirituality and consciousness bring the viewer to a mixed state of awe and frustration. The discovery that yoga has depth beyond its popular identity as a stress-reliever is wonderfully refreshing. However, this new knowledge also engenders a nagging question: why then have the spiritually profound aspects of yoga given way to its now superficial, largely fitness-oriented identity?
Just as provoking as the scientific tidbits is the movie’s clever crowd-pleasing strategy of featuring famous proponents of yoga. The film mentions that Steve Jobs admired Yogananda’s autobiography and that the text triggered in him a belief in humanity’s “infinite potential” in its ability to devise newer, better technology. This allows the movie to fully take on its role as a bridge between the material efficiency of scientific understanding and the timeless spirituality of the East.
Armed with both lyrical and historical assets, “Awake” is fully capable of dissipating one’s prejudices about yoga—and of even bringing the viewer to a state of spiritual discovery that approaches the heart of a yogi’s teachings. Though the movie may convert viewers to Yogananda’s beliefs to the point where they are disgusted with the “yoga” depicted in glossy magazines and offered in their local gym class, the film will trigger in them a new respect for the sheer dynamism of yoga’s presence in the modern American psyche.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, World AIDS Day provided a moment to reflect on the history of the disease, while giving us a chance to look forward. Wordwide, rates of new infections are sharply declining, and the United Nations hopes to eradicate the disease by 2030. The world has come a long way since Ronald Reagan’s press secretary infamously joked about homosexuality and AIDS (what was then called the “gay plague”). Stigma, especially against the queer community, has lessened as scientific advances have given us greater insight into the fact that HIV can affect anyone.
However, that stigma still remains strong in one place: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
According to FDA rules, men who have had sex with another man, or MSM, since 1977 are “indefinitely deferred” from donating blood. Perhaps such a blanket policy seemed sensible in the 1980s, when fear and homophobia trumped science in the discourse on HIV/AIDS. Those fears make the policy no less wrong. In the present day it is not only impractical, but also furthers homophobia against gay men.
This is not the first time we have highlighted the outmoded ban, but with the FDA now at least considering a change, the issue bears revisiting. The science currently available ensures the safety of blood banks without making blanket regulations. After receiving blood donations, the FDA tests all donations for several diseases, including both types of HIV.
The regulations against MSM unnecessarily stigmatizes queer men in particular, while ignoring other, historically less stigmatized demographics who also are considered at-risk for blood-transferable diseases. People who have contracted an STI can still donate blood, provided they wait 12 months. People who have had sexual contact with an MSM can, after the same waiting period, also donate. Those who engage in promiscuous heterosexual sex (another risk factor for HIV/AIDS) do not face any regulations against blood donation. And yet, under the current FDA rules, a man who has only engaged in monogamous, protected sex with a long-time male partner is unable to donate.
Earlier this fall, the Health and Human Services Department voted to change the policy that has been in place since the 1980s. On Dec. 2, the FDA’s Blood Products Advisory Committee met to discuss the policy surrounding donations from MSM. However, recent reports show that members of the FDA’s committee are still skeptical about such a change, and that a revision of the policy was not even put to a vote.
Other countries, including Australia, Italy, Japan, and Sweden, have more progressive regulations that allow MSM to donate under various conditions. A 2010 study showed that a year-long deferral for MSM did not increase the risk of HIV through blood donation. And, with recent technology, HIV can be detected in only two weeks after sexual activity.
The science points to one conclusion: The FDA ought to revise its outdated regulations that unnecessarily stigmatize queer men.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, the Harvard Art Museums reopened, and with them another addition to Harvard’s museum landscape: the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African and African American Art, which will host rotating exhibitions of American, European, and other black art traditions. World-renowned architects Italian-born Renzo Piano and Tanzanian-born David Adjaye designed the respective spaces. These events took me back to a difficult 20-plus years fight to bring African art into equal footing at Harvard.
Like their visions, the exhibition spaces for the Harvard Art Museums and the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery are notably different (204,000 square feet versus 3,500 square feet). These distinctions become even greater if we add the sizable off-campus art museum storage and other facilities. Separate but hardly equal, one museum is in a prime campus setting, while the other comprises a pair of small storefronts on a busy thoroughfare several blocks from the yard.
But to focus on this feature is to miss other key aspects of Harvard’s historically problematic museum treatment of Africa and its arts. With the exception of Egyptian art, African art is not permanently exhibited anywhere on Harvard’s campus. This significantly outdated situation reflects a painful legacy, as New York Times art critic Holland Cotter ’70 writes in a recent review. For African, Pre-Columbian, and other works, Cotter observes that “you must go to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology down the street, where such art wasn't, at one time, art at all and was segregated from high art in a way that mirrored American racial politics. ” Cotter concludes that “unlike the Yale University Art Gallery, the Harvard Art Museums don't add up to an encyclopedic collection. … Harvard, art wise, has a lot of globalist thinking to catch up on.”
The Peabody Museum historically housed objects classified as “primitive” in the colonial era taxonomy of social Darwinism. Significantly, even in this setting, there are no African galleries—nor has there been one for over 35 years. Student engagement with the continent of Africa in this museum setting principally takes the form of fifth floor laboratories and offices for Archaeology and Human Evolutionary Biology. For students visiting the building, Africa serves mostly as evolutionary exemplar.
The recently opened Peabody exhibition “Art of War” reinforces this theme of cultural difference and separation, leaving the impression that African societies privilege war, while others value intellectual engagement. (Ironically, the Kongolese work featured in related publicity is an object of status (not a weapon or object of war.)
Alas, to my knowledge, with the exception of Egypt, neither the Peabody museum, nor any other at Harvard, has had an ongoing African area curator since World War I.
Harvard once was a leader in the curatorial engagement with Africa. In 1934, seven years after the Fogg Museum’s opening, the groundbreaking curator Paul Sachs supervised a student-led exhibition featuring African and Oceanic art. This, with similar exhibitions, left an imprint on museums elsewhere—most importantly the Museum of Modern Art in New York, whose 1936 “Cubism and Abstract Art” exhibition featured African art alongside modern works. In 1937, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, a member of MOMA’s Board of Trustees, gifted Harvard a stunning sculpture from Benin, or modern-day Nigeria. A sixteenth century portrait-like casting in bronze, it was the perfect work to spur further art museum engagement with Africa.  But this did not happen.
Thirty years later during the Civil Rights movement, Alfred H. Barr implored Harvard University and its art museum to bring African works into the art collection. Harvard declined. What followed was a 1969 “African Masterpieces” exhibition at the Peabody Museum intended to showcase these works as “art.” Sadly, this event was accompanied by the removal of African works from the fifth floor Peabody African galleries and the transformation of this space into office and lab spaces. Fast forward to the 1990s, when the Harvard Art Museum turned down an important African and Oceanic collection with curatorial funding by William E. Teel ’49. In the interim years, African sculptures that came into the art museum (largely as bequests) were transferred to the Peabody.
It took Henry Louis Gates Jr. and his Yale classmate Ethelbert Cooper to provide the financial means to finally bring African and diaspora works to campus in a series of temporary exhibitions in a museum-like setting. Credit Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith also with giving the okay to a new art exhibition space near campus.  But for me, the museum and exhibition openings on campus represent a deeply bittersweet “victory.” I have fought through every means I could think of and at every level of the institution to bring African art on equal footing here.
Change will happen, but likely not in my lifetime. For me, the Harvard museum legacy with respect to African art represents the greatest failing of my career, one that has an impact on students and others now and into the future. No one individual or group bears blame. This reflects university history, structural differences, and the ways that race still affects life and intellectual engagement on campus.
The separate and notably unequal treatment of African art at Harvard reinforces a long and deep history of racial prejudice in this country that sadly is still present and, in some contexts, even growing today. Fortunately, institutions are not fixed: They can and do change, and room still can be made to address this problem in forthcoming university and museum decisions. Art matters. Museums matter. Harvard matters.

Believe it or not, there used to be a time when sequels were not announced before the first installment of the series even came out. Those were the days when making a movie in and of itself was a daunting financial loss for studios, let alone the making of a whole string of them. As a matter of fact, one of the main reasons why Lionsgate rejected Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy was the fact that it entailed a commitment of more than one movie.
Nowadays, films have more of a “universe” approach. If you check nearly all the developments happening on Rotten Tomatoes’ “Weekly Ketchup” section, you discover that there is a nary a film being developed that does not have the potential to be juiced for more story and, as a direct result, cash. One film is no longer enough to tell a story. That is why,  even though I haven’t watched Mockingjay: Part 1, I know it would be impossible to review it on its own merits. There is a bigger story to be told, one that is only complete in the face of the whole four-part trilogy.
This is what has been happening in the TV world for many years. It is impossible to judge a standalone TV episode simply for its own merits. Each episode is part of a wider, overarching story, and a part can’t serve as an accurate measurement of the whole thing. Rather, it serves as a measuring stick to see whether the characters are developing properly or the plot is not poking holes in itself.
We have to wait for the very end, however, for our investment to be justified. It’s what kept many viewers of Lost glued to the screen for six often-frustrating years—the expectation that the resolution would make sense of it all. And, when the resolution proved to be frustrating, it left many fans dissatisfied.
Granted, most films and TV shows do not tie themselves up in complicated plot machinations like Lost does. But, due to the pursuit of these ultimate answers, many viewers lost sight of how the characters were growing right in front of their eyes. The relationships on which the show was built were lost in the wider macrocosm of the overarching story.
It is difficult to say whether this is a good thing or not. On the one hand, more story is not a bad thing. It is a chance to engage with a world on a deeper level. On the other hand, we become unable to view the wonder of personal developments in a story. Oftentimes, stories serve bigger purposes when all you can get out of them comes from one source. For instance, even though I have watched the original Star Wars trilogy, I always feel like I am missing out on something because there is a wide literature behind these characters that threatens to deepen the story beyond what I am currently experiencing.
This is too often what happens in our society. We get so caught up at looking at the bigger widespread significance of things that we overlook the emotions of the moment. We believe that our moment in history is important because of the way that it interacts with the wider narrative of history.
In the end, the tragedy of Michael Brown is not that it speaks to some greater problem about racism in America or the failure to train police officers or any other countless societal ills. These are all valid points to make, of course. But, for those who might believe that none of those issues are a valid point, there is tendency overlook the fact that a teenage boy with a future is now dead—all to prove a political point.
And for those who rightly get outraged at the tragedy, the tendency is to exploit one family’s suffering and pain and make part of a bigger narrative, regardless of the specificity of the situation.
Our society is obsessed with the sweep of history. It might be because, now more than ever, we have more of it at our disposal. It might be because, thanks to social media, we can see visible change happen quickly. It might be because, as our storytelling tendencies demonstrate, we are obsessed with stories that are epic and grandiose, that can transcend multiple forms of media and immerse viewers in more ways than one.
But we forget the personal. We forget the epic tragedy of small events. It’s not simply there to either entertain us or assure us of our place in history. It’s there to move us on a gut level, not to be shoehorned into a bigger narrative..
We can’t be assured of sequels. As a matter of fact, we might wish that they were never made. But we can make sure that what we witness and experience moves us on a personal level. That it makes us weep and cry and even be outraged in the face of tragedy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When newly elected Massachusetts State Senator Eric P. Lesser ’07 arrived at Harvard from his hometown of Longmeadow, Mass. in the fall of 2003, his career in politics was well along its way.
“Eric has always been focused on public service. He practically came out of the womb focused on public service,” said Jake C. Levine ’07, who first met Lesser in high school when they served together as U.S. House of Representatives Democratic pages during the summer of 2001.“When he was sixteen, he prevented the jobs of 40 teachers from his hometown from being cut due to a lack of funding by organizing a massive door-to-door campaign. His campaign slogan when he was elected high school class president was ‘The Lesser of Two Evils.’ Even his AOL screen name was ‘prezboy007.’”
At Harvard, Lesser continued his political engagement, jumping into numerous programs at the Institute of Politics. In the spring of 2004, Lesser’s freshman year, Lesser, Levine, and Peter P.M. Buttigieg ’04, now the mayor of South Bend, Ind., co-taught at Baldwin Elementary as part of CIVICS, a joint program offered by the IOP and the Phillips Brooks House Association that sends College students in teams to teach civics classes at local public elementary schools.
Lesser’s friends say that they remember how well he connected with fellow IOP members. That coalition building has taken Lesser from Harvard to the Obama presidential campaign, the White House, and last month to victory in the First Hampden and Hampshire Senate district in western Mass. Lesser, who is also a former Law School student and former Kirkland House tutor, will begin serving on Beacon Hill in Boston on Jan. 7.
OH KIRKLAND, OH KIRKLAND
As he jumped into the campus political scene, Kirkland House residents say that Lesser also applied a trademark enthusiasm to House life.
“Eric was a house patriot right from the beginning,” said Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley. “He identified with the house. He made it more than just a residence; he made it a locus communis.... He was always excited about something.”
One of Lesser’s legacies at Kirkland is “The Ode to Kirkland,” which he wrote during his junior year.
“It was the night before Housing Day, and I was overcome with pride in Kirkland House. I had been talking with my roommates about it, and I just sat down and in a flow of consciousness typed out this little ode,” Lesser said. “I shot it out to everybody on the Kirkland open list at about 1 or 2 in the morning and declared in the email that we have to study this and learn it and sing it tomorrow when the new freshmen come for the welcome reception."
Though Lesser’s undergraduate days are long gone, the Ode has survived.
“The Ode has become the identificatory lyric Kirkland House,” Conley said. “It stayed with him and is now being passed on from one class to the next and people sing it at every House gathering. It is absolutely unique.”
KIRKLAND HOUSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE
In November 2006, Lesser’s enthusiasm for politics led the College senior, who was serving as president of the Harvard Democrats, to a local rally headlined by Deval L. Patrick ’78, the soon-to-be governor of Massachusetts, and then-Senator Barack Obama.
“I sent out an email ahead of time to the Dems open list, only expecting twelve or so people to show up, twenty at the most. When I arrived at the T station to go to the rally, there were about a hundred people all gathered, most of whom I had never seen before,” Lesser said. “We all went together and that is when I first started to realize that [Obama] was something special.”
Obama’s speech at the rally inspired Lesser to join Obama’s nascent presidential campaign the next spring. Each weekend, as his classmates counted the days until Commencement, Lesser and a few other volunteers would head north to New Hampshire to organize for Obama.
“We would go up there, there wasn’t even an office when we first started. We would all meet at a bar in Manchester and strategize and hang out,” Lesser said. “I kept going and going and going, and each time I went up I brought more and more people.”
Lesser said he dropped his plans to write a thesis due to his commitments to the campaign. After graduating in 2007, he took a job to work on the New Hampshire advance team as one of the early full-time staffers for the Obama presidential campaign.
Within a few months, Lesser said senior campaign staff began to recognize his commitment and promoted him to the national advance team.
“I was essentially the equipment manager for the reporters, staff, and the Senator traveling across the country on the plane,” Lesser said. “I made sure that their bags went where they were supposed to go.”
The new position came with the privilege of traveling with the future president for much of the campaign. Lesser’s efforts caught the eye of other campaign staff, including his future boss, David M. Axelrod, then-Senator Obama’s senior campaign strategist.
“Right from the start I gleaned that Eric was very committed, very capable, and endlessly energetic,” Axelrod said. “When it came time to pick an assistant for the White House, I figured that if he could get my bags from the airplane to the hotel room and all over this country without losing them, he could probably get me from one place to another in the White House.”
Axelrod also said that Lesser was a central figure at the White House and made an effort to build relationships with fellow staffers.
“Eric was so friendly and so warm that he knew everybody. He knew everyone’s assistant,” Axelrod said. “Oftentimes I would hear about what was going on not from the Chief of Staff or from the President but from Eric. He was like a news service for me.”
THE HOMECOMING
In the fall of 2011, after spending more than two years at the White House, Lesser left the West Wing to return to Harvard to study at the Law School and serve as a Kirkland House tutor with his then-fiancé, now wife, Alison F. Silber.
Law Professor Joseph W. Singer said that he noticed a distinguishing characteristic in Lesser  that differentiated him from many of his other students.
“He was not only smart but has a lot of practical wisdom. It’s not something that everyone has,” Singer said. “I think he had a sense of not just how to analyze legal issues but understands how they work in the real world. I think he understands human nature and he impressed me with his thoughtfulness and his good judgment.”
As a Kirkland House tutor, Lesser was able to take on a new role in the House community by serving as a mentor to many students and the director of “Conversations with Kirkland,” a speaker series that brings public figures to Kirkland House to engage with House residents and affiliates.
“Eric was able to connect Kirkland residents with internships in politics and helped them get on this campaign and on that campaign, and Alison was an outstanding pre-law tutor,” Kirkland House Master Verena A. Conley said. “They were some of the finest tutors we have ever had.”
A HIGHER CALLING
In January 2014, on the final stretch towards graduating from Harvard Law School, the State Senate seat in Lesser’s home district opened. After more than a decade away, Lesser said that he decided it was time to return home and run for the seat.
Lesser, Silber, and their recently-born daughter Rose packed their bags to move back to Lesser’s parents’ home in western Mass. to start the campaign. Before he left, Lesser decided to bring a little bit of Kirkland with him in the form of his new campaign manager, William L. Morrow '15-16, a Kirkland resident and one of Lesser’s concentration advisees.
“When he called and asked me if I wanted to take a semester off to work as his campaign manager, I said absolutely. No doubt,” Morrow said.
From the get-go, Lesser had many supporters from the Harvard community, including former University president and Economics professor Lawrence H. Summers, who worked with Lesser at the White House.
“Eric has enormous energy. He is very thoughtful, committed to making the world a better place, able to subordinate his ego, is loyal to his friends, [and] decent to his adversaries,” Summers said. “I told people who I asked to support Eric’s campaign that supporting him now might as well be as close as they get to what it would have been like to support Barack Obama when he was in his 20s.”
When asked about what the future holds for Lesser, Levine reiterated the importance of the people of Longmeadow in Lesser’s life.
“I think he really feels excited and comforted in a way to be back home and represent the people that he has really grown up with,” Levine said. “I am pretty confident that he will be somewhere representing the people of his community and working on behalf of his community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Xfund, a Harvard-affiliated seed-stage venture capital firm with an office in Maxwell Dworkin, announced Thursday that it is launching its second fund with $100 million in new capital and has opened an additional office in Silicon Valley.
The firm, which bills itself as dedicated to funding liberal-arts-minded entrepreneurs across the country, started in 2011 as a partnership between four venture capital firms—NEA, Breyer Capital, Accel Partners, and Polaris Partners—and the University. It originally consisted of less than $10 million in capital and a single fund, Xfund 1. Today, it is invested in five different companies, three based in the Cambridge-Boston area and two from San Francisco.
Several Harvard faculty members and affiliates serve as advisors for Xfund, including Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray, Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, University professor Douglas A. Melton, and Innovation Lab Managing Director Gordon S. Jones.
Co-founder W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a longtime tutor at the College, said the fund’s growth is a reaction to the larger-than-expected interest from entrepreneurs and will allow Xfund to continue to forge a “unique partnership with the various communities that we work with.”
Van Vuuren, who is also a general partner at the firm, said that the size of Xfund 1 “didn’t anticipate the demand and just the level of activity on campus…. As a team we were under-resourced, both in capital and in time, to do our founders and the potential of the community justice.”
Speaking about the relationship between the firm and the i-lab, Jones said that in addition to financing projects there, Xfund has helped student entrepreneurs develop their startup ideas.
“From the i-lab standpoint we are thrilled whenever we see friends of Harvard, and in this case the Xfund, being a resource that’s being made available to students from the community,” he said. “I see this as an added contribution to the time and resources and expertise that the students can take advantage of.”
Jones cited Philo, the online TV streaming company previously called Tivli, as a startup that was simultaneously incubated at the i-lab and financed by Xfund.
“I think it’s an exciting announcement in the sense that you’ve got this fund closing a certain amount of money that now is going to be targeted towards student innovators from Harvard or other universities who have…potential solutions that can be addressing very large problems in society,” Jones said. “One of the needs that often these teams have is to be able to access sufficient funding and expertise to help guide and advise them as they try to grow and take on the problems that they are trying to solve.”
While Van Vuuren described Harvard as the “spiritual center” of Xfund, he said that the firm is now “completely independent” from the University. “The money that we invest does not come from Harvard,” he added.
Still, he said, Xfund is “anchored at the engineering school…. We are a 100-percent aligned behind Harvard and also the engineering school’s mission.”
Amid the other shake-ups, Xfund co-founder Patrick S. Chung ’96, a former Crimson editorial chair, will join Van Vuuren as a full-time general partner to lead the new Silicon Valley office.

Weeks after Boston officials closed a major homeless shelter located on a island in Boston Harbor, local homelessness service providers said they are already struggling with increased demand before the onset of winter.
The Long Island Shelter was the Boston area’s largest, housing more than 700 people a night. When Boston city officials closed the only bridge servicing the shelter on Oct. 8 due to concerns about its stability, these people were left without a place to live.
“There’s an increased demand for services across the board,” said David K. Tang-Quan ’15, a Harvard Square Homeless Shelter administrative co-director.
According to Tang-Quan, the number of requests for emergency and regular beds at the Harvard Square Homeless shelter has significantly increased this year. Each day, the shelter has heard from about ten more homeless persons than normal.
“We have more unique guests calling in,” he said. “It’s not just the same population.”
Although the city of Boston, which ran the Long Island Shelter, created more spaces for the homeless elsewhere in the metro area, including the South End Fitness Center, it did not replace all of the 700 beds lost to bridge construction.
“There doesn’t seem to be a great deal of immediate change,” Mary Shannon Thomas, a social service worker specializing in homelessness cases, said. Many of the city’s shelter solutions, she said, were longer-term plans that would not be implemented until 2016.
One gap that has resulted from the closure of the Long Island Shelter concerns “detox beds," beds with medical support, designed for people who are trying to recover from substance abuse.
“We had 60 or 65 detox beds out there, which is like half the capacity of the area, and those are all gone,” she said. “That’s a huge deal.... We already didn’t have enough detox beds.”
Tang-Quan spoke of another unintended consequence of the Long Island shelter closing. Several guests at the Harvard Square shelter, he said, had left identification and paperwork at Long Island and have been unable to access them. According to Tang-Quan, this has led to a higher demand for the shelter’s resource advocates from people who need to refile this information.
Barbara V. Trevison, director of communications at Pine Street Inn, a homeless shelter in Boston, said that the coming winter will only exacerbate the pressure on local shelters.
“We always know we need to staff up during the winter,” she said. “It’s a little hard to tell just what we’re going to see, especially if it’s a cold winter this year, with the additional people who have been displaced.”

The Graduate School of Education received a $5 million grant that will boost its Doctor of Education Leadership Program, School of Education Dean James E. Ryan announced in late November.
The grant, requested from Walmart founders' philanthropic arm, the Walton Family Foundation, will fund three fellowships in the program, the creation of online course materials, the institution of forums on education leadership, and the building of an alumni network, program co-director Elizabeth A. City ’94 said.
Introduced in 2010, the three-year program trains cohorts of 25 students to become leaders in America’s PreK-12 education. Participants receive a full tuition funding package and are offered a residency at a partner organization in their third year.
According to City, the grant will enable the School of Education to sustain the program over time and to increase the school’s impact in the field of education leadership.
Ryan said that the program has generated a lot of support from individuals and institutions who “believe that leadership is a key issue in education.”
“This is a really innovative program,” he added.
The program takes a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from courses at the School of Education, the Business School, and the Kennedy School of Government, according to associate professor of education Martin R. West IV.
“We thought it would be useful to bring together representatives from a broad range of these organizations to compare best practices, identify common challenges, and examine the extent to which leadership pipelines can be improved in order to support the American education system,” West said, adding that the program represents a new practice-based model for the development of education leaders.

Six years after J.K. Rowling delivered the Harvard Commencement address that University President Drew G. Faust called the most “moving and memorable” she had ever seen, Rowling’s motivational words will be immortalized in an illustrated book, according to a statement released on Tuesday by publisher Little, Brown and Company.
The book, titled "Very Good Lives: The Fringe Benefits of Failure and the Importance of Imagination," is set for a worldwide release on April 14, 2015.
In the speech, Rowling spoke of the ethos of failure by using her own rags-to-riches stories as an example.
“The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive,” Rowling said in the address. “You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.”
The move may come as little surprise to many in the Harvard community, who remember the address—in which Rowling spoke of the ethos of failure—as one of the most powerful ever delivered at Commencement Exercises. In a community that has, at times, been characterized as risk-averse, Rowling’s words still prove inspirational.
"I have heard and read many commencement speeches, none more moving and memorable than J.K. Rowling's," Faust said in a press release. "Years after her visit to Harvard, people still talk about it and still find inspiration in her singular evocation of the idea that living a meaningful life so often means daring to risk failure."
Little, Brown and Company’s announcement is bound to please the many fans of Harry Potter—the bestselling series of fantasy novels born out of Rowling’s own failures—on campus.
“It’s not surprising that [Rowling’s] words are still so important today,” said self-identified “avid Harry Potter fan” Alex M. Fisher '18.  “It’s great news she will be credited for it like this.”
Rowling and the publisher also announced that a portion of the proceeds from sales of “Very Good Lives” will be allocated to University-wide financial aid funding at Harvard and to Lumos, an organization founded by Rowling that helps disadvantaged children.
Representatives from Little, Brown and Company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Humanities Initiative, a new student group that aims to tackle critical issues regarding the perception of the humanities in modern society, held a discussion titled “Combating Skepticism in the Humanities” at the Barker Center Thursday evening.
The discussion was the first in a series called “Human Conversations,” targeted at providing humanities-focused students with an informal setting for discourse. The group aims to be recognized by the Office of Student Life during the spring semester, according to the Initiative’s founder Josh E. Stallings ’17.
The discussion was attended by about 20 students and featured an appearance from Diana Sorensen, dean of the Arts and Humanities Division. The dialogue focused on the perceived need to defend a humanities education as well as the notion of a divide between the humanities and the sciences.
Elena Monge Imedio ’18, an Initiative board member, addressed the perception of humanities courses as being less difficult than math or science courses.
“Nuance and a willingness to explore what we don’t know shouldn’t be seen as a weakness,” she said.
However, students were cautious to say that there was a clear division or sense of rivalry between the humanities and the sciences.
“I feel like people like to create this ‘us-them’ binary where all the science majors are here on the ground and all the humanities majors are floating off up on an island somewhere,” said Bridget R. Irvine ’16, an English concentrator. “I don’t know why people like to reinforce this binary.”
Others emphasized the underlying parallels in the humanities and sciences.
“When I talk to people, the most interesting discussions I’ve had center around the fact that we all need to answer normative questions about what we value, and why we value them,” said Gabriel H. Karger ’18 during the discussion. “No person is going to be able to go through life without answering these questions, whether it’s through science or humanities.”
For the majority of the students, the conversation provided a much-needed starting point: an environment for discussion.
“The sciences here are so big, and they all have their own communities and p-set groups and study sessions,” Irvine said. “[Computer Science 50] is like a country in itself. I’m glad that we have this group.”
Stallings said he hopes that the discussions will be an inviting space for students to explore issues regarding the humanities.
When asked about plans for the future of the Initiative, Stallings said the group has numerous ideas for more events, including a speaker series, internship and research opportunities, and conferences.
“Increasingly, there’s been a lot of dialogue about whether or not the humanities are important and what their importance is in this increasingly technologized world,” he said. “What we want to do is take on this question and answer it in a way that promotes and asserts the importance of the humanities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, success comes with expectation. Having rocketed into the national rankings this season, the team hits the road this weekend determined to prove it belongs there.
Looking to extend its four-game winning streak, the No. 9/8 Crimson will travel to Princeton on Friday to take on the Tigers and to Hamden, Conn. on Saturday to take on No. 15/15 Quinnipiac.
Harvard (7-1-2, 3-1-2 ECAC) is looking to build off of its road victories against two top-five opponents, Boston University and UMass-Lowell, last week. This is the first time the Crimson has been ranked in the top 10 nationally since the 2005-2006 season—the last time the team made the NCAA Tournament.
“I think we’re pretty confident in ourselves right now, and I think we saw what happened to BU and Lowell, those guys were ranked above us,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “I think it adds a little more motivation to the team that we want to keep winning. We’re not near the top yet. Eight and nine aren’t one.”
This weekend will be the first time that the team has competed outside of New England since it traveled to New York on Nov. 7 to take on Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Union College. But Harvard is 5-0-1 away from the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this season and has already taken down three top 10 opponents on the road.
Junior goaltender Steve Michalek and junior Jimmy Vesey—who were named ECAC Goalie and Player of the Month in November, respectively—are key reasons why the Crimson sits in a tie for second place in the conference behind Quinnipiac. Michalek boasts a conference-best 1.57 goals against average, while Vesey and his linemates—Criscuolo and sophomore Alexander Kerfoot—have recorded 17 of the team’s 36 goals.
“I’m playing on a great line right now,” Vesey said. “Everything is kind of just clicking for us. I think we’re a well-rounded line of hard work, skill, and speed. Those guys have put up just as good numbers as I have, and so any of us could have gotten ECAC Player of the Month.”
Harvard will look to continue its trend of getting on the scoreboard early and maintaining the momentum. The Crimson has scored first in seven of its 10 games and has tallied 14 first period goals on the season.
“I think this year, the difference between the last couple years has been that we’re starting every game really well,” Vesey said. “The last couple years, we went down one or two goals in the first period of every game, but this year we’re coming out with a lot of energy and after the first period.”
Though Princeton (2-7-1, 1-5-0) is in eleventh place in the ECAC, the Tigers have had more success at home, picking up both of their wins at Baker Rink. Similar to Harvard last year, Princeton is led by underclassmen, as six of the team’s top nine goal scorers are freshmen or sophomores.
The Bobcats (9-4-1, 5-1-0) have won eight of their last 10 games and currently reside on top of the ECAC standings. Quinnipiac is led by sophomore forward Sam Anas and freshman forward Landon Smith, who have combined for 33 points.
The Bobcat power play will look to challenge the Crimson penalty kill, which has given up a goal in each of its last three games after going the first seven without conceding a single one.
While Quinnipiac may stand out to some as the team’s tougher game on the weekend, the Crimson is not looking past Princeton. The games this weekend will be Harvard’s last until Dec. 28. The Crimson is looking to go into the meat of its conference schedule atop the conference, which the team could accomplish with a win over the Bobcats.
“Obviously, the goal is four points,” Criscuolo said. “But, at the same time, we’re going to focus on Princeton first. The record might not show it, but I think they’re a talented group. When we get to Quinnipiac, they’re obviously a very skilled team. Hopefully [we can] stay out of the box against those guys and just play confident[ly] at their place.”

One door closes, and another opens. Plagued by a worsening back injury, it seemed unlikely that goalie Bethany Kanten would continue her Crimson career. But for Kanten, the Harvard women’s soccer senior goalie-turned-midfielder, it was only natural to leave her place between the posts and return to the field.
“I talked to my long-time coach and friend about the decision,” Kanten said. “He told me, ‘You haven't been training all of these years to be a goalkeeper, you've been training to be a soccer player.’”
Soccer had been a main part of the Park City, Utah native’s life since she could walk. At the age of two, Kanten began her soccer career as a field player, following in her older brother’s footsteps. When Kanten turned 14, her coach moved her to goal. But due to her desire to play both positions, she played for two teams—in goal for one and at midfield for the other.
But when she donned a Crimson uniform in 2011, Kanten focused solely on her job between the posts, tallying with 15 appearances and 44 saves in her rookie season to help her team to a 9-3-1 record and an Ivy League Championship.
“She was a great goalie for us,” junior forward Emily Mosbacher said. “Her skills with her feet made her such an asset in the goal.”
She put up similar stats in her sophomore season, and everyone expected that Kanten would continue improving.
Few people knew, though, that Kanten’s back had been ailing her since freshman year.
“It's been a struggle for me to continue playing in the goal for as long as I did,” Kanten said. “I was always in pain after practice and games.”
As the seasons went on, Kanten’s back pain intensified. She said she suspected her junior season might be her last in goal, but it was still a difficult realization to come to. As she had feared, Kanten was told at the end of her third season that she would not be allowed to continue in goal.
“I knew that Bethany had back problems, but finally hearing how much pain being in goal had put her in was terrible,” Mosbacher said. “As sad as it was that Beth couldn't play in goal anymore, I think it made for an exciting time in her soccer career.”
For most goalies, this news would signify the end of their careers. Kanten, though, had the advantage of starting out as a field player, so it was fitting that she would end her soccer career as she started it: on the field.
“Not being able to be a part of the team and contribute to our success wasn't a decision that I was ready to make at that point,” the former goalkeeper said. “I felt like I still had something left in me to give to the team, and the thought of not being around those girls everyday made the decision to play on the field an easy one.”
Although the switch meant Kanten would continue to spend time with the team, it also meant she would spend far less time with her fellow goalies, senior Cheta Emba and sophomore Lizzie Durack. But both Emba and Durack, along with the rest of the team, supported and motivated Kanten during the transition and throughout the year, according to the former goalie.
Kanten was able to translate some of her most important goalkeeping skills onto the field—notably, communication across the field.
“As a goalkeeper, one of your primary jobs is to be constantly talking to your defenders about where they should be moving to, or where the other team's attacking players are,” Kanten said.
In addition to her vocal presence on the field, Kanten was a constant threat to score. Her leg strength and shot placement, developed from years of practicing punts and goal kicks, meant that she could score from practically anywhere on the field. She had the highest shot percentage on the team, placing six of nine shots on target, most of which came from outside the box. She scored three of these nine shots to finish the season as one of the team’s top-five goal scorers.
Kanten proved that she still had her goalie’s kick in a game against University of Rhode Island, when she scored from 30 yards out.
“Being able to be on the other side of a goal was such a positive experience for her and our whole team exploded in that moment,” Mosbacher said. “She was so happy and we were so happy for her.”
Kanten returned to goal once this season, and made a career-high 11 saves for the Crimson against BU.
“I'm grateful for the impact soccer has had on my life and all of the amazing, strong, insightful people I have met along the way,” Kanten said. “I'm proud that I was a part of this team for four years and have made some of the closest friends that I'll have for the rest of my life.”
