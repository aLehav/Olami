“The Lion King” (2019) somehow squanders a dark Shakespearian story, a talented voice cast, and a gargantuan $260 million budget with a tedious remake of the animated classic. When “The Lion King” (1994) first hit theaters, it was billed as Disney’s first original story (although this was controversial given its similarities to the Japanese anime “Kimba the White Lion” (1950-1954)), but the remake neither breaks new ground nor bothers to attempt to. Its greatest strength — admittedly stunning photo-realism — is also its greatest weakness because otherwise animated, lively characters bear stony, lifeless expressions.
The story of “The Lion King” (2019) is beautiful, but only because it’s the same story as it was in 1994. Director Jon Favreau tacks on 30 minutes of extra runtime, but additional footage doesn’t translate to a more robust story because the vast majority of new scenes are frustratingly inconsequential and only slow down the action. Two new subplots make for decent supplements: One brings “The Lion King” closer to its narrative inspiration, “Hamlet,” and the other is a timely commentary on environmental sustainability, but Favreau neglects to substantially explore these disparate themes. Even though he doesn't introduce much new material in his shot-for-shot retelling of the original story, CG wizardry ensures that each re-made shot is wallpaper-worthy.
Ultimately, it’s not Favreau’s unsettling lack of originality that sours this film; it’s his impractical over-commitment to realism in a story that relies on capturing imagination. The characters look photo-realistic, but since animals don’t use the same facial muscles that humans do when showing emotion, it’s impossible for this hyper-realism to convey singing, anthropomorphic characters. So why make “The Lion King," a story fueled by over-the-top emotion, photo-realistic in the first place? Favreau's new aesthetic leaves most of the cartoon's bright characters feeling monotonous, which is most noticeable with Simba’s inexplicably blank reaction to the horrific wildebeest stampede. This commitment to realism drains all of the heart from his scenes — even from the most heartbreaking one. How is the audience expected to invest in a self-serious drama whose own characters can’t show emotion?
Sometimes, Hans Zimmer's soaring soundtrack alone is enough to elicit a Pavlovian response. It's gorgeously orchestrated and bolstered by charismatic voices (Donald Glover voices Simba and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter voices Nala). “The Lion King” is at its best when it tries to bottle up this nostalgia: The performance of “Circle of Life” in particular is breathtaking. But again, the confused "realistic" aesthetic approach hampers much of the musical magic, and nowhere is this clearer than in “I Just Can’t Wait To Be King.” The song is meant to reflect the naive, bombastic visions of a young prince, which is why directors Allers and Minkoff employed surreal choreography and a changing color palette in 1994. Favreau doesn’t attempt these in live-action, leaving for bland visuals with some lyrics like “Everybody look left! Everybody look right!” with no one actually looking left or right. Also, what time of day should “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” take place? Bonus points if one guesses midday. These changes may seem insignificant, but in a film that precludes emotional investment, it's enough to lead one to believe that they’re not watching “The Lion King,” but a pale imitation of the beloved classic.
It’s disappointing to see Favreau operate on this middling level; it’s hard to imagine that the same director who once risked it all with “Iron Man” to kickstart the MCU is now mimicking “The Lion King” to upsetting results. But despite all its flaws, Favreau’s remake isn’t entirely unwatchable. If you haven’t watched “The Lion King” for 25 years, the remake can at times feel nostalgic. If you haven’t seen the original at all, this version will have its moments of magic. But if you’re a committed fan, avoid this hollow, soulless film and keep your "Lion King" memories untainted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BERLIN, GERMANY — After a 15 minute walk westward from the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, our walking tour of Berlin comes to a halt in a parking lot. 
 The guide pauses, and the crowd murmurs in confusion. I look up at the apartment complex around us. The buildings are brick, grey, unmemorable. Why have we stopped here? What could possibly be remarkable about this unremarkable place?
Beneath our feet, the tour guide informs us, lies the remains of the Führerbunker — the bunker that served as Hitler’s final headquarters during WWII. Buried under the concrete lies an intricate network of of rooms and passageways that were occupied by top officials in the Nazi party. It is from here that Hitler detailed his plan for The “Final Solution.” All this dark history rests beneath our feet, under this parking lot, in this forgettable place.
One tour company has put up their own sign explaining the significance of the location, but beyond that there are no plaques to indicate that this lot was once the epicenter of power in the Nazi regime. It is difficult to fathom the temple of evil that collects dust, meters below.
A tourist asks the guide if we can take a tour. “No,” she shakes her head — no one is allowed down there. In the aftermath of WWII, the German government made the express decision not to memorialize this place in any way; they wanted to discourage Nazi sympathizers from using it as a place to gather. While six million Jews are remembered at an expansive, open-air memorial just a kilometer down the street, Hitler’s bunker is closed to the public. His material legacy has been condemned to decay in anonymity.
The tourists resume their chatter and the guide leads us out of the parking lot, but as the others move forward, I hang back. I look closely at the apartment buildings around me, at the family SUVs scattered across the lot, and at the cursed ground beneath my feet. Without dissecting the impulse, I feel compelled to take a few photos while the others walk away. Something makes me feel intensely uneasy about this place.
It is not the weight of the history that makes me uncomfortable. I am not disturbed by the knowledge of what’s buried underground, but rather what exists above it. I am bothered by the green of the grass by the sidewalk and the Direct TV dish propped up on a balcony. I am unnerved by how easy it is for pedestrians to walk or jog by — for Berlin to move on.
I appreciate the German government’s refusal to memorialize the Führerbunker in any way. For a man who dreamed of global influence, burying Hitler’s home under a nondescript parking lot is perhaps a fitting punishment. However, while I do not think we should give the Nazis a privileged place in our collective memory, I also do not think it is wise to have the general public forget what is beneath the ground, beneath this time.
#NeverForget is the mantra of Holocaust surviors and Jews around the world who vow to never forget the atrocities of genocide. Yet, just 74 years after the end of WWII, people are beginning to forget. A recent survey of Americans found that 41 percent do not know about Auschwitz, the death camp in which 1.1 million Jewish lives were snuffed out. Another study found that for German school children aged 14 to 16, less than half know about the camp.
Never Forget. Well, the world is already forgetting.
It gives me comfort that my memory of the trip to the Führerbunker will be preserved in this article, because I fear forgetting. I do not want to forget the place I saw that Saturday afternoon as easily as I forgot what I had for breakfast that morning.
In this moment, just a week after my Opa died from a stroke, the imperative to remember is stronger than ever. When my grandfather was alive, so were his memories of what it was like to flee Nazi Germany at the age of 10. He would not forget that fateful Easter morning when the Nazi’s stormed his home and burned his possessions. My Opa would not forget having a gun pointed to his head, just as he would never forget the day his own grandfather was beaten to death by a Nazi officer.
But he is gone now, and he is not here to keep these memories alive unless others take up the burden for him. Nearly a century after the end of WWII, few refugees and survivors remain to tell their stories. The thought of these memories dissipating fills me with dread, as does the seeming innocence of this parking lot.
I resolve to not forget.
The question, of course, is how to remember the past without becoming stuck in the mire of history. This is a daunting issue to navigate, and I do not presume to propose an answer here. But what I do know is this: If we forget the past in an attempt to move forward, we will begin to see ourselves move back.

Whether you’re waiting for your internship to end or staring at a blank wall in your home, it’s never too early to brace yourself for the chaos that is fall semester! While fall semester may seem like a far off dream (or nightmare, no judgment), here are some small things you can do to prepare while watching reruns of “Golden Girls” or waiting for Lorde’s new album. By starting small now, you might just save yourself a stressful headache (or two) later on.
Start shopping for classes
It’s always a good idea to start looking at class syllabi before shopping week comes. Whether you’re reading Q guide reviews and getting some tea on your required classes or discovering that a course on anime does exist, browsing classes online and finding more out about them is a solid first step.
Catch up with friends
Now that you have some time, it would be nice of you to say hi and catch up with your old pset buddy or roommate. You can show that you’re a loyal and kind friend through a few texts or FaceTime calls. Still, try not to be too jealous that they’re vacationing in the Bahamas or casually doing groundbreaking research.
Scope out new extracurriculars
It’s natural for interests to change from year to year, and taking another look at all the extracurriculars that Harvard offers is a good way to explore something new worth trying. Asking friends what they’ve enjoyed, sending a few emails, or even just picking something randomly (like the Rock, Paper, Scissors Club or the Surf Club) are all ways to set the stage for exploring something new next year.
Stock up on snacks and supplies
If you don’t want to pay ridiculous prices for last minute college commodities (looking at you, Tommy’s Value), you might as well keep an eye out for cheap essentials and sales over the summer. In that same vein, stocking up on specifically snacks will be useful for your roommate who’s probably pulling an all-nighter during her first week back. Especially if you’re not from the area, you might want to buy a few extra bags of ketchup chips, or whatever snack you like from home that’s not available in Cambridge.
Buy an intro textbook
If you know you have to take a required class with a heavy workload, it might be worth buying the textbook or a prep book now, as opposed to later. You don’t have to study like you’re cramming in Lamont at 3 a.m., but taking a look at the material every now and then will help you feel more acquainted with it.
Relax
We’re obviously still in summer. Don’t feel guilty about taking some time to be with your family and ordering Chinese food every other night. It’s harder to start strong in the fall if you feel like the work never stopped.
Now that we’ve made it to August, the end of summer is in sight! Enjoy the rest while you still can, but if you’re naturally skilled in really stressing yourself out, then there’s plenty of ways to start preparing for the fall!
