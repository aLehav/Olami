After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Along the Cape Cod National Seashore stands a tall, wooden post. Rising up about 20  feet from the sand, it is unremarkable save its curious existence on this beach. Those who visit it call it the Silents’ Pole, and though it bears no inscription, there is a story behind this post.
For most people, the Silents’ Pole will remain silent—and, for that matter, unnoticed. You cannot know its story without making a strange pilgrimage to this barren, sandy Mecca. In fact, you must first be geographically pinpointed, and only then can you uncover the story. Accessing the novel takes no rain dance or ritual—it’s as simple as touching a screen.When readers download publisher Eli D. Horowitz’s brainchild, an Apple app called “The Silent History,” they are not getting just an e-book. Instead, they are getting what co-author Matthew D. Derby calls a “tree-like” narrative. “One half of it acts as the trunk, and that’s the central narrative. That’s composed of 120 testimonials, which are little oral histories,” Derby says. Alongside co-author Kevin F. Moffett, Derby crafted this narrative “trunk,” a six-volume story of a worldwide epidemic that causes children to be born without speech, told through the first-person accounts of several characters who watch the crisis unfold. Each testimonial is released daily to the readers so the epidemic is examined through many eyes, one step at a time.
The central narrative, though beautifully written, is not what distinguishes “The Silent History” from other serial e-books. The branches are where it gets interesting. “The branches of this tree are the field reports, and these are shorter pieces that are written in the fictional world of the app/novel,” Derby says. It is up to the readers of “The Silent History” to participate in writing the story. A reader can fill in the gaps between the characters’ perspectives by crafting fictional field reports of their own, which can only be read by other readers if they travel to the location of the anecdote, guided by the GPS in their iPhone or iPad; the Silents’ Pole is actually the subject of a field report. “We’re trying to create this experience in a reader where…this little tract of land, whether it’s a street corner [or] some tree in the middle of a field would be forever bound to this fictional experience that they had while reading this little vignette,” Derby says.
A connection like this is rarely a part of the traditional literary experience; the project diverges from the print book’s escapism because the world about which you are reading is before your eyes. But although the experimental method behind “The Silent History” may seem like an attempt to change the way we read, it actually reinforces an ancient and inextricable tie between story and setting.
SCREEN VS. SKY
It is, perhaps, the coldest, windiest day yet this fall, and I find myself on a busy corner of Central Square on Mass. Ave, staring at my iPhone in the gale. People around me, I’m sure, think I’m just another kid glued to my phone. It’s okay, I tell myself. I’m reading. And it’s true: I’m reading one of the field reports, a story about a homeless person who loses use of his or her leg right where I’m standing. It’s cinematic, the way you’re pulled in, but you are unaware of the screen. You’re in the film itself. The worst part—or maybe the best—is when I turn and see a man in a wheelchair beside me, and suddenly this man who I would have never noticed before becomes a manifestation of the story. I feel the story change the place; it is invisible graffiti on the brick walls around me. Though the story remains unseen to most passersby, I will always see it when I get off at the Central Square T stop. It lives there.
This is precisely the experience that Horowitz wants readers to have. “When you’re reading a thing and then you look up at it in the world and piece it together yourself, it’s a kind of thrilling, chilling reading experience,” he says. “When you’re walking around, you have that kind of questioning and wondering and observation and mythologizing.” Horowitz hopes that readers will take this curiosity about the physical environment beyond the screen and watch the world become a blank canvas primed for a writer’s paint.
In order to engage with this narrative in particular requires more than pure fantasy—one must build the bridge between the central narrative and one’s imagination. Readers have to map a fictional world onto the real one. “They write something geographically specific that makes meaning out of the physical world that they’re actually inhabiting and also the physical world of their imagination,” Moffett says. In this way, the reader inhabits the role of the writer, and the real world shifts into fiction. When you write a field report, you are inscribing a surface with an invisible story to be preserved in cyberspace.
For Teri Rueb, a locative soundscape artist, this kind of intimate bond between story and setting is the difference between living in and truly inhabiting a place. In 2005, she designed a sound installation in Boston Common that transported viewers to the setting of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, locating them by GPS in the same way that “The Silent History” does. “When you write in the landscape, if you will, a work like this, you’re challenging people to encounter the unfamiliar or to maybe inhabit the city or landscape in a...way that rubs against the grain of their typical daily movement,” she says of the app. “It’s a civic identity: to actually be out in dialogue in a kind of direct engagement with the city, with the population, to inhabit it.” To engage with the world in an imaginative way, she says, is not merely entertainment—it is a civic duty.
Achieving this connection, however, involves a counterintuitive process: staring at a screen rather than the environment around you. “It’s easy to satirize people looking down at their iPhones when there’s a beautiful, cloud-filled sky,” Derby says. “So what we wanted to do is turn that notion on its head and...allow people to get closer to the outside world with these devices that are normally associated with people being way more distant from the physical world.” When you read “The Silent History,” you are using a smartphone—a device that, similar to literature, is used to distance ourselves from reality—to see your environment with new eyes and connect with other readers. Technology becomes a ligament between fiction and reality—between the central narrative story and the collective story generated by the readers.
CONTAGIOUS CLICK
When Horowitz envisioned his newest project, he knew it couldn’t be a stack of paper bound and sandwiched between two covers. It was to be a story about the whole world, and his collaborators agreed that it needed to grow as more and more people told their stories. “A book can’t accommodate this kind of growing, interactive type of narrative,” Moffett says.
When he and Derby were deciding how to write this kind of narrative, Moffett was inspired by the collected oral histories of the AIDS epidemic in late ’80s San Francisco and of polio in mid 20th-century Iowa. He knew a comprehensive story should have the wide scope yet intimate feel of an oral history. “It’s the story of a medical phenomenon. That’s something that affects people all over [and] that’s kind of unified but that can play out very differently for each individual,” Horowitz says. “It was kind of a communal experience with a core thrust, but a million ramifications.” By allowing readers to participate in the writing process, the project was able to simulate the breadth of an epidemic in a way that would have been extremely difficult in novel form. In this sense, “The Silent History’s” approach imitates the way in which we try to understand large-scale events by listening to personal accounts of those affected and piecing them together.
Wanting to integrate this natural instinct to invest ourselves in a narrative inspired a collaborative approach for “The Silent History.” In conceptualizing this project, Horowitz wanted to anticipate this investment and incorporate the readers’ devotion into the original product. “It’s a deep-rooted aspect of the way we invest ourselves in stories and look for evidence of their footprint on the world,” he says. “What I wanted to do was create a format where that kind of obsession was baked into the project itself.”
“The Silent History” is revolutionary not because its form is unprecedented—serial e-books  exist, as do other forums, such as fan fiction, for readers to expand on the stories they love—but because it welcomes the devotion of a reader to a story by allowing them to participate from the start. “It democratizes narrative,” Derby says. We all own the story, and we are allowed to mold it ourselves.
ECHO HISTORY
”The Silent History” is certainly also not the first time that writers and researchers have tried to make the intimate bond between story and setting a technological reality. In 2005, MIT professor Nick A. Montfort, who is also president of the Electronic Literature Organization,  pioneered the “Bubble Project,” a sticker-art movement in which people fill in blank thought-bubble stickers posted on advertisements, pretending to write the model’s thoughts—literally writing on the environment, as opposed to the invisible graffiti made by “The Silent History.” Artists like Rueb and Stefan Schemat, who designs soundscapes, are likewise pioneers in the interactive-fiction field. “There’s the impulse to say, ‘This is new, it’s the first thing, there’s nothing like it,’” Montfort says. “People in fact do new things and, in fact, what they do is connected to history.”
He’s right. MIT was the site of much literary experimentation in the late ’70s and ’80s  as the first personal computers arrived on the scene. Researchers developed some of the first interactive fictional e-worlds (what now we call video games). Later came hypertext fiction—a story in which the plot is determined based on the links one clicks.
It’s the hybridization of collaborative and locative experiments that, along with the technology, that distinguishes “The Silent History”—not the age-old impulse to immerse oneself in a story. In designing her locative soundscapes, Rueb draws on the Native American belief that a landscape carries the history of the people who have lived there. “They believe that when you go to a place, you’re activating that history or that narrative, and that the narrative cannot exist outside of this location,” she says. “It’s actually a very ancient idea.”
Perhaps, then, one is able to trace this human desire to connect narrative to place all the way back to ancient folklore. “Neither of these elements is a digital-age invention,” Harvard English professor Leah Price wrote in an email. “I would see it more as a case of reinventing the wheel.” No story, real or fictional, lacks a setting, and though one could try to tie this recognition to the advent of the technology that allowed that connection to blossom, doing so is fruitless.
Therefore, the introduction of every new mode of experimental literature is not necessarily a threat to the way we read stories. Projects like this one are merely a logical next step in a long line of attempts to immerse readers more fully in a narrative. “It’s kind of a motivation that is a basic human curiosity,” Derby says. “The iPhone doesn’t create that. It just provides us with a new way to explore that.”
A NEW LINK
For now, iPad and iPhone technology seems to represent the realization of such an ability—it allows us seemingly infinite freedom to experiment. “The technology itself was so far behind the imagination of the people that were attempting to write [interactive literature] that it ended up being a really frustrating experience,” Derby says. “But now, all of that [technology] is so seamless and so deeply integrated into our lives. The moment has arrived where we’re losing this distinction between print and digital.”
It remains unclear whether the next step for electronic literature will be defined by e-books that are indistinguishable from their paper forms or more experimental efforts. “E-books are a publisher initiative, and they’re about how to effectively distribute and market books to people digitally, but if you see what’s available on the Kindle, there’s very little innovation in form,” Montfort says. According to him, electronic literature is largely initiated by authors, usually made available to all readers, and demonstrates great innovation. “I see [‘The Silent History’] as a possible point of convergence between more innovative efforts that authors are making and the e-book,” he says. Because the project was initiated by Horowitz—a publisher whose job it is to market the novel but who is also responsible for the experimental form of the novel—“The Silent History” represents a possible fusion of mainstream e-book culture and more niche-oriented e-literature.
Even though “The Silent History” distances itself from mainstream e-books—a form of literature that makes some devotees of the print book uncomfortable—its creators do not envision this form becoming the modern means of reading. “None of us took part in this project because we want to dance on the grave of the printed book,” Derby says. “I think we all believe that the printed book is going to continue and thrive, and this is not in any way a replacement for that.” Rather, the creators want to send the message that there is still potential for experimentation in literature.
Given the fast pace of technological advances, there is always the risk for innovators of going the way of the dinosaur—their inventions losing their relevancy with time. Derby wrote a work of hypertext fiction for his senior thesis at Brown University in HTML form. Saved only on a floppy disc, the work is likely lost, not to mention nonfunctional in a modern sense. Despite new efforts at curating experimental and digital fiction, Horowitz, Derby, and Moffett recognize that this project will someday likely become as functionally irrelevant as Derby’s floppy disc narrative.
Producing a successful literary innovation, however, is merely a matter of negotiating convention; audiences will sift through these experiments, embracing some and rejecting others. “You have to sort of accept that if you’re going to write in this medium, at least for now,” Derby says. “It’s going to be like the wild wild West for many years. It’s kind of fun that way.”

Dear President Obama,
It’s been a day, Mr. President, but you have yet to fulfill any of your so-called “campaign promises.”
You may very well be the first lame duck presidential elect. Perhaps that is why all the newspapers have said that your election is so historic. But don’t let it get to your head. Every election is historic by definition. That is how history works—look it up.
So at the time of the writing of this letter, it has already been a full day since the election. What have you done in these first crucial 24 hours? Even Romney has done something to help the United States—he lost an election. Meanwhile, all you’ve done is dance around in confetti and tweet pictures of yourself hugging Michelle. You don’t have time for this nonsense. Michelle can hug herself. Plus, I heard from reliable nonpartisan sources (my imagination and gut instinct) that you have been celebrating your victory with champagne. Do you really want to replace Grant as one of the drunkest presidents? You’ve written enough history for one night.
Let’s see if you have managed to achieve any of your campaign promises throughout all this spouse hugging nonsense.
Jobs: Things aren’t looking much better for me, personally. I’m still unemployed. Based on the fact that my resume says “dog-walking” as my only work experience, future job prospects are also looking pretty grim.
The economy: The stock market has taken quite the down turn. I’m not an Ec major, but experience with colors in kindergarten tells me that red numbers are not good. From what I’ve read of the New York Times’ headlines and opening sentences, it looks like you spent all day calling up old friends, like Boehner, and trying to compromise on fiscal cliffs, or something like that. Come on, now is not the time to catch up with old friends by planning fun outdoorsy cliff rappelling outings.
Immigration: Not only does it not look any easier for immigrants to enter the country, but now it looks like you have an emigration problem as well. I’ve been trying to get into Canada all day.
Foreign oil dependence: The gas stations are still open, prices are still up, and my car still can’t fly. Enough said.
Mr. President, clearly you have yet to do anything to move this country forward, or even backward for that matter. So far it looks like you’ve spent a third of your time since the election sleeping. A third. We can do better than that. I believe I speak on behalf of all citizens when I say stop hugging your wife and help me get to Canada. I think I could get there quickest via flying car.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the most recent escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip, members of the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee staged a “die-in” outside of Annenberg on Tuesday.
As one member chanted over 100 names and ages—those of Palestinians who had been killed in Israeli assaults since last Thursday—protesters laid down on the grass to demonstrate solidarity for Gaza.
The ages of the victims were read to emphasize the brutal nature of the conflict, according to Lena K. Awwad ’13, co-chair of the PSC.
“For me personally, the event is not about militants versus an army, it’s more about the children in Gaza,” Awwad said. “If you notice from the reading of the list, a lot of them are below the age of 15 years old who’ve been killed.”
One student held up a poster that quoted a three-year-old Palestinian named Abdullah. It read, “When the missile comes to our house, I hope my strong and big parents will hit it and push it away.”
While the die-in occurred, other PSC members handed out fliers about the recent events to passersby and invited them to pose with a whiteboard that read, 'I stand in solidarity with Gaza because...’ and to fill phrases such as 'students in Gaza,' 'families in Gaza,' 'women in Gaza,' or 'men in Gaza.'
The pictures will be part of a series posted on the PSC’s Facebook page, according to Awwad.
“It’s just a series of statements to express why we’re in solidarity and the fact that this war is about families. It’s about schoolchildren. It’s about innocent civilians who are being targeted every day,” Awwad said.
The protest at Harvard is one of many in the Boston area since the attacks on the Gaza Strip began, according to Alex R. Shams, a PSC member and student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences,
Protests have occurred in Copley Square, Boston University, and the Boston Common.
The protests have not been coordinated together, according to Shams. "They’ve been spontaneous mobilizations at different campuses and in different areas,” he said.
Although the protest at Harvard only reached those passing by Annenberg around lunchtime, the organizers are hopeful that the event will lead to greater awareness around the world, Awwad said.
“Harvard is ... such a well-known place that we’re trying to make it clear that even here, in the seat of American power, in the heart of America, there are people that disagree with Israeli policies and American policies aiding Israel,” Shams said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looked like the Harvard men’s basketball team went on Thanksgiving break a day early.
On Tuesday night at St. Joseph’s, the Crimson fell behind by double digits before the second media timeout and never pulled within 10 the rest of the way, losing, 75-56.
“Really tough night for us,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose team shot one-of-eight from the field and committed eight turnovers in the first eight minutes of play. “I’m disappointed how quickly we got ourselves buried.”
Just four days after shooting 54.3 percent from the field in a 34-point victory over Manhattan, Harvard couldn’t get anything going offensively. The Crimson (2-2) shot 19 of 50 from the field and coughed up a season-high 18 turnovers.
On the other end, Harvard struggled to slow the Hawks’ offense, which opened the game on a tear. St. Joseph’s (3-1) shot 53.1 percent from the field in the first period and took a 41-23 lead into halftime.
“Our defense wasn’t what it needs to be in a game like this,” Amaker said. “I’m disappointed that we weren’t able to pull ourselves together a little bit when things were going south.”
Hawks guard Carl Jones finished with a game-high 24 points on 8-of-11 shooting off the bench.
Playing in just his second game of the season, Jones checked in with 15:09 to play and quickly made his presence felt. The 5’11” guard knocked down a triple on his first trip down the court and, before the end of the half, had posted 18 points.
Sophomore Wesley Saunders paced the Crimson with 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting, making him the only Harvard player to shoot over 50 percent from the field. Saunders added a team-high nine rebounds.
After a string of three strong performances to open his college career, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers struggled against the Hawks. In 31 minutes the rookie committed five turnovers—matching his total from the Crimson’s first three contests combined—and recorded season lows in both points (2) and assists (2).
Coming off a 17-point performance in Friday’s drubbing of Manhattan, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard came out cold against the Hawks. Rivard opened the game shooting 0-of-4 from beyond the arc, contributing to the Crimson’s 0-of-9 start from deep.
The junior found his stroke in the second half—connecting on four straight triples in a span of 3:18—to fuel a 26-5 Harvard run to close the contest. But it was too little too late, as the Hawks’ early lead proved insurmountable.
The Crimson struggled maintaining possession in the contest’s early going, as Harvard turned it over on four of its first six trips up the court. St. Joseph’s capitalized, going up 13-3 with 14:42 to go off a Jones triple.
Sophomore Jonah Travis recorded the Crimson’s first field goal with 14:04 left to pull Harvard within eight, but that’s as close as the Crimson would get. Jones found Ronald Roberts under the basket for a layup to put the Hawks back up by 10 with 12:42 to go.
The Crimson couldn’t find an answer for Jones in the final 10 minutes of the period, as the guard closed out the half with 12 points to lead the Hawks on a 21-16 run.
“Jones was outstanding,” Amaker said. “He was very efficient.”
Harvard’s deficit hovered around 20 points for the first six minutes of the second half, but the Crimson hit a dry spell midway through the period. After a Travis free throw with 13:52 to go, Harvard failed to score until 8:11 remained. During that stretch, the Hawks extended their lead to 40 points.
Rivard’s hot hand helped pull the Crimson within 19 by the final buzzer, but the loss still marked Harvard’s worst defeat since Dec. 22, 2010 when the Crimson fell at UConn, 81-52.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team appeared to have no trouble taking all of its momentum on the 45-minute drive to Worcester, Mass. on Tuesday. After shooting over 50 percent in a win against BYU four days earlier, the Crimson moved to 3-1 with an 80-62 win over Holy Cross.
Junior Christine Clark led all scorers with a season-high 25 points. Classmate Missy Mullins added a career-high 13 points as the only other Harvard player to finish in double-figures. Outside of that duo, the win came on a total team effort. Five other players scored at least six points, and the team made 50 percent of its 62 shots while converting on 47 percent of its three-point attempts.
“It was a tremendous team effort tonight, and Holy Cross is a good team,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I’m pretty proud of the win.”
It took the Crimson nearly two minutes to get on the board, but Clark got the offense going with a three-pointer to give the visitors an early 3-2 lead. From there on, the first half presented the Christine Clark show. The guard entered halftime with 17 points, shooting six-of-nine from the floor and three-of-four from behind the arc. She also accrued five rebounds, two assists, and two steals in the first 20 minutes of play.
“I thought early in the game my teammates did a great job feeding me, and I had a lot of open looks,” Clark said. “That led to me being really efficient scoring wise.”
On Clark’s effort, Harvard slowly built a 45-33 lead to protect in the second half. It did just that, holding a double-digit edge until the final buzzer sounded, keeping the Crusaders to just 37 percent shooting and forcing 11 turnovers in the period.
“We’ve stressed it so much—every single day of practice is always about defense,” Clark said. “So it’s nice that these past two games we’ve really picked it up and played great team defense.”
The closest Holy Cross got to tying the game in the second half came two and a half minutes into the period when a layup cut the Crimson lead to 11, 50-39. But senior Victoria Lippert came right back and hit a jumper to extend the lead to 13. From there, Harvard forced two turnovers, the second of which gave the Crimson the ball under its own basket. At that point, Clark’s dominance of the home team came to a head as she bounced the inbounds pass of a defender’s backside before gathering it and converting an easy layup to give the Crimson a 15-point advantage.
“I just saw that both of the players had their backs turned to me so they couldn’t really see what I was doing,” Clark said of the play.
While the Crusaders might not have been paying attention to the guard on that play, her coach was noticing Clark’s performance all game long.
“Clark played great,” Delaney-Smith said. “She was controlled; she was smart; she didn’t force any shots; she was so accurate; and her shot selection was excellent. She did a great job.”
The team didn’t look back from there, eventually gaining a game-high 22-point lead with just under six minutes to play, even as most of the starters made their way to the bench. Mullins led the team during that stretch, scoring seven points in a span of less than five minutes. The last of those points came on a trey from the top of the key as the shot clock expired.
“Missy has always been one of our best defensive players, and part of what we wanted her to do was grow into an offensive player,” Delaney-Smith said. “She had a terrific offensive game tonight.”
Led by Mullins, the Harvard bench finished the night with 32 total points, while the Crusaders’ backups tallied just six points combined.
“Every single bench player who subbed in kept the same level of play and level of aggressiveness so that we were able to play a pretty consistent game all the way through,” Clark said.
The Crimson’s 3-1 record ties its best start since the team started 5-0 in 1987.
“I think we are right on course,” Delaney-Smith said. “I probably expected to win the games that we’ve won.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
St. Joseph’s was wearing its silver home uniforms, but there weren’t many silver linings for the Harvard men’s basketball team Tuesday night.
The Crimson was run out of the gym, both literally and figuratively, by a bigger and more athletics Hawks squad at Hagan Arena.
Harvard’s 75-56 loss marked the first bump in the road for an inexperienced team that had opened its season impressively, blowing out MIT and Manhattan and nearly upsetting UMass on the road in between. On Tuesday, the Crimson closed the game on a 25-6 run, but that came only after the Hawks had opened up a 40-point lead.
Just as it did against St. Joseph’s last season, the Crimson fell behind early thanks to a hot Hawks shooting performance in the first half. But a year ago, Kyle Casey’s 26 points helped Harvard storm back to a dramatic five-point victory. This season, a young Crimson squad truly felt Casey’s loss for the first time, as it struggled to hang with the team picked to finish first in the Atlantic 10 preseason poll.
Harvard began the game 0-for-10 from downtown and did not hit its first three until there was just 8:11 remaining in the contest.
“I hope [it was just bad luck],” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “It snowballs a bit when you can’t make a shot, and that’s what happens.... We’ve got to be effective and learn how to help our team in different ways even if we aren’t shooting or scoring very well.”
Meanwhile, the Hawks shot 40 percent from behind the arc, hitting 10-of-25 threes in the blowout victory. On the whole, St. Joseph’s dominated the pace of the game, taking 67 shots to Harvard’s 50—always a bad sign for a Crimson squad that prefers to slow things down.
In just his second contest of the season, the Hawks’ Carl Jones scored a game-high 24 points in 23 minutes off the bench. Jones, the team’s leading scorer a year ago, was suspended for St. Joseph’s first three games for violating the university’s community standards.
“That’s what [Jones] does,” Amaker said. “He’s a scorer.”
TURN BABY TURN
After forcing the Jaspers into 26 turnovers Friday night, it was Harvard’s turn to struggle with ball control on Tuesday, as the Crimson committed 18 turnovers to go with just seven assists.
“That’s the game,” Amaker said. “You could look at that stat right there and determine how poorly we played. It was very disappointing. We were sloppy with the ball and made [bad] mistakes.”
Sophomores Kenyatta Smith and Wesley Saunders turned the ball over on the Crimson’s first two possessions, setting the tone for what would be a recurring theme.
In the game’s first ten minutes, Harvard had seven turnovers and just one field goal. Chambers, who entered the contest with just five turnovers through 111 minutes during the course of his first three games, had that many in just 31 minutes Tuesday night.
All of those turnovers led to 24 Hawks points over the course of the game and were a significant factor in helping St. Joseph’s build an early lead it never came close to surrendering.
“We lost [our] composure,” Amaker said. “You could tell they were ready to go. Unfortunately they knocked us on our heels and really had us in a hole early. We’ve got to get better.”
NORTH BY NORTHWES
One of the few bright spots on the evening for the Crimson was the play of Saunders, who tied his career-high with 18 points and snagged nine rebounds.
The sophomore finished 8-of-11 from the field and was one of the only players on the roster who was able to get to the basket against a rangy St. Joseph’s defense led by talented shot-blocker C.J. Akin.
“They’re very athletic and very quick and have great size and length, so it was very difficult to [penetrate],” Amaker said. “When we did have opportunities early, we didn’t finish.”
Saunders scored seven straight points for the Crimson near the end of the first half on a short jumper, a layup, and a nifty and-one, but by then Harvard was already down 18.
Nonetheless, it was the second time this season that Saunders scored 18 on the road in the face of a rowdy student section, as he did the same a week ago against the Minutemen. Saunders’ 14.3 points per game now leads the squad.
“Wesley made some plays for us,” Amaker said. “But it’s hard to judge a positive performance out of any one player from our team, given the way the team played and the margin of victory.”

Can you feel it? The leaves have turned, Yale has been publicly humiliated, and it is once again inappropriate to solicit candy from your neighbors. That's right: it's Thanksgiving!
Lucky for you, Flyby's got your back with some new traditions to spice up your holiday.
The Turkey Shoot: The centerpiece of any Thanksgiving dinner, a sinewy bird can stoke the fires of family resentment like nothing else. Tenderizing is a must, but salt brines are too seafaring and mallets are straight up barbaric. Try channeling the ancient Greeks with a turkey shot putting competition. Simply wrap the fowl in a sturdy bag and take turns heaving it as far as possible. The victor is henceforth immune from all quizzing from extended family, including but not limited to: "When are you going to settle down with a nice girl?," "Did you just eat that entire pecan pie?," and "Your cousin Gary just got into med school, don’t you love your mother?"
Around the World in 80 Sways: Nothing says American Thanksgiving quite like an older family member having one drink too many and making some undiplomatic statements about other cultures. Instead of challenging your elders on such matters, make some bingo cards listing other ethnic groups and tick off as offended. It will only be a matter of time until you've got five in a row.
Note: it is good form to donate some of your winnings to an organization along the lines of the NAACP or Anti-Defamation League, as appropriate.
Bird of Pray: Many Thanksgiving dinners begin with a prayer that thanks a higher power for the many gifts and privileges we appreciate in life. But you're in college now and a godless heathen such as yourself (or "spiritual agnostic," whatever helps you sleep at night) has no time for such orthodoxy. Instead, throw a curveball by leading your family in a thoughtful reflection and then dedicate it to a less-appreciated deity. The Great Satan is a little obvious, Cthulhu the giant octopus antichrist a bit too nerdy. We suggest getting topical points by praising Ixchel, the Mayan goddess of motherhood.
Pardon Me: Since the beginning, Thanksgiving has been based on goodwill. From the Pilgrims sharing a meal with the Native Americans (before, um, letting them share the continent with us) to the President pardoning a turkey (before, um, overseeing an annual partial genocide of its species) revelers have always used the holiday as an opportunity break tensions and break bread. Get into the spirit of Thanksgiving and reach out to those with whom you haven’t always gotten along!
Have a pint with your old rival from the debate team. Watch some pigskin with your uncle who once said you threw a football like the bedridden grandmother from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." Place a blanket over your napping neighbor who used to shoot at you with a BB gun. Please refrain, however, from infecting this blanket with smallpox.
