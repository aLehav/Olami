After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor's Note: The June 6 news article "Former Harvard Student Arrested After Attempted Robbery" sourced information and speculation about Blackwelder-Baggett's background at Harvard College to an anonymous source referred to as "a former close friend." The statements stood in opposition to The Crimson's established policies on anonymous sourcing and therefore have been removed.
 
UPDATED 11:20 p.m.
Forrest N. Blackwelder-Baggett, a former Harvard student in the class of 2011, was arrested Monday, May 3 for attempting to rob a restaurant near his hometown in Texas.
Former Mather resident Blackwelder-Baggett allegedly entered Delta's Restaurant soon before it closed Sunday night, demanding cash as he pointed a gun at the owner's chest, according to Austin's KEYE TV.
When the young intruder noticed that an employee of the family-owned restaurant had started to call the police, Blackwelder-Baggett ordered her to put the cell phone down.
Sean Gharibi, the owner of Delta's, seized upon the moment of distraction to grab Blackwelder-Baggett by the throat: "He was scared and shaking and begging me to let him go," Gharibi told KEYE TV.
Gharibi then threw the suspect out, KEYE TV reported. As Blackwelder-Baggett backed up his car to drive away from the restaurant, the female employee noted the license plate number and reported the information to the Austin Police, who then traced the registration number to the home of Blackwelder-Baggett's mother in Cedar Park, Texas.
Blackwelder-Baggett, who has been charged with first degree felony of aggravated battery, is currently being held at the Travis County Correctional Complex in Del Valle, Texas. His bond is set at $50,000.
The owners of Delta's Restaurant declined to comment, and the Austin Police Department could not be reached for comment.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal was not available to return a request for comment on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frank Herrmann ’06 began his major league career with the Cleveland Indians on June 4 with 1.1 hitless innings against the Chicago White Sox and one strikeout against former Indian Omar Vizquel. The right-handed reliever was called up by the Tribe just that morning from Triple-A Columbus and earned the hold in Chicago in the evening.
Herrmann is Harvard's first major league player since southpaw pitcher Jeff Musselman ’85 retired in 1990.
The 26-year-old Herrmann was signed by Cleveland as a non-drafted free agent in 2005 and contributed nine columns for The Crimson during his first year of minor-league play in 2006.
In 19 appearances in Columbus this season, the 6’4”, 220-pound hurler went 3-0 with two saves and a 0.31 ERA. In his 28.2 innings, he allowed a single earned run, fanned 22, and walked only eight.
The former Crimson pitcher entered the majors with a scoreless streak of 27.1 innings in Triple-A. Since entering the Tribe farm system in 2006, he has gone 33-23 with a 3.62 ERA. In Hermann’s 146 appearances, he made eight starts and averaged 9.3 hits, 2.3 walks, and 5.9 strikeouts per nine innings.
At Harvard, Herrmann went 9-6 with a 4.93 ERA, five complete games, 81 strikeouts, and 102.1 innings pitched. In his third and final season in 2005, he went 5-2 with a 4.34 ERA and two shutouts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 24th, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy embarked on the 2010 USO/Morale Entertainment Coaches’ Tour, along with Texas Tech’s Tommy Tuberville, Chip Kelley from the University of Oregon, West Point’s Rich Ellison, and Illinois’ Ron Zook.
The whirlwind tour—which took the five coaches to Germany and Southwest Asia to meet and encourage U.S. troops—concluded nine days later. Courtesy of USO’s Oname Thompson, read some of Murphy’s thoughts on the tour after the jump:
-“[The tour] was not something I had to think about, and I committed to it on the spot.”
-“We have two recent Harvard Football players who are at Camp Pendelton [Calif.] as Marine Corp officers awaiting deployment to Afghanistan, and it’s the least I can do to show my support for them and all the brave men and women of our armed forces.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Radcliffe lightweight crew ended its season this past weekend with a strong showing at the 108th Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) National Championships on the Cooper River in Camden, N.J.
After getting through very competitive opening heats, both the varsity eight and varsity four boats finished their respective grand finals in fourth place, one position shy from medaling for the Black and White.
“I’m very pleased with how the team performed,” Radcliffe coach Heather Cartwright said. “Considering the level of competition, I thought that we did quite well. We have a young team, with just two seniors competing in the two boats and a lot of freshmen returning.”
“There was definitely a lot of tough competition at the regatta, so we didn’t set concrete goals in terms of placing,” sophomore coxswain Jana Douglas said. “We were focused on just trying to have our best race. Unfortunately, we didn’t medal, but all you can control is what you can do in your own boat. In terms of that, everybody was pleased with how it turned out.”
The Black and White’s journey to the IRA National Championships began three weeks ago at the Eastern Sprints, where the varsity eight and varsity four took the bronze and silver medals, respectively. More impressively, every rower on the team reached the medal stand, a feat that no other lightweight team can claim this season.
Radcliffe entered the opening heat of the Championships last Friday hoping that momentum would carry over from its successful performance at Sprints.
While the varsity four had no problem qualifying for the finals with a second-place finish, the varsity eight took a longer route to the championship round, relying on a victory in the repechage after failing to qualify in the opening heat.
“We didn’t get into a rhythm like we normally do,” Douglas said. “We went out a bit too high on the stroke rate, so we had to lengthen our stroke a bit in the repechage.”
“We had a big target on our back in the heat,” Cartwright said. “Georgetown was charging for us, and we didn’t have our best race in the heat. I was very proud of how our girls were able to finish two races [on Friday], especially in 90-degree heat.”
“Obviously, it’s not ideal to race twice before the grand final,” Douglas added. “But it was something we had to do—buckle down and get through it. There’s so much adrenaline at that point that you don’t really feel the pain until a little bit later.”
Due to its performance in the opening heat, the varsity eight was slotted to the sixth lane in the final round. Without much tailwind and other such advantages as the other lanes, the boat, in fifth place for much of the first half of the race, was able to rally ahead of both Georgetown and Bucknell to finish fourth with a time of 6:43.715.
“The fact that the boat came in fourth in lane six was very good,” Cartwright said. “We held our ranking and they had their best race today. I think that the team is satisfied with how it performed and is hungry to get a medal next year.”
Wisconsin, the two-time defending champion, was dethroned as Stanford upset the top-seeded Badgers with a 6:28.209 finish.
Meanwhile, members of the varsity four rowed together for only the second time in the finals.
The Black and White started the race in sixth place but was able to claw its way back to fifth by passing Georgetown in the second 500 meters. Radcliffe then set its eyes on Stanford. With just 20 strokes to go, the boat pulled barely ahead of the Cardinal to cross the finish line three-tenths of a second ahead of Stanford with a time of 7:44.569.
“Every stroke was a learning experience for them,” Cartwright said. “The girls have really worked hard together.”
With two fourth-place finishes in hand, the Black and White will hope to build on its successful dual campaign as it prepares for the upcoming season.
“We certainly have the talent returning, and we have a great freshman class coming in,” Cartwright said. “The goal is to move from where we are now to where we’re contending for a national championship. Changes have already been made this year with Stanford and Loyola winning the national championships [in the varsity eight and varsity four]. So why not us next year?”

Upon arriving in Cambridge, many freshmen struggle try to find enough hours in the day to balance extracurricular activities, classes, and college life.
But when John K. Wand ’74 showed up at Harvard four decades ago, he was faced with an added challenge: fatherhood.
After learning that his high school sweetheart was pregnant, Wand married her during the summer after his senior year in high school, and the two moved together from Boise, Idaho, to Cambridge, where their son was born. But his new wife soon left Wand to raise his son and handle Harvard on his own.
Wand’s experience provides the inspiration for a new movie, Freshman Father, which is showing on the Hallmark Channel tonight at 9 p.m.
Though some details of the story have been changed—the movie is set in the present day, and the events have been condensed to fit within freshman year—Wand told the Boston Herald that the movie is a mostly accurate reflection of his life.
He said that he and his son, now 39, both planned to watch the movie.
