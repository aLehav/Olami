After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror,” John Ashbery ‘49 stands in a gallery in Vienna and contemplates the self, both as it appears in a painting by Parmigiano and in his own poetry. Looking at the distorted image, what he finds is something shifting that lapses “Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up / Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape.”
In Ben Lerner’s novel, “The Topeka School,” protagonist Adam Gordon finds himself thrown into a similar state of existential flux in a less likely location: a high school debate tournament. Wearing an ill-fitting suit and his father’s tie, Adam lapses into a glossolalic fit, his speech propelling itself forward, “stretched by speed and intensity until he felt its referential meaning dissolve into pure form.” This ordinary, uncanny moment is characteristic of Lerner’s novel and his kaleidoscopic and often brilliant inquiry into the power of language in American society.
With five books of slippery and ruminative fiction and poetry under his belt, Ben Lerner has established himself as an emerging postmodern writer. His first novel, “Leaving the Atocha Station,” documents the struggle for artistic authenticity of a young poet who, like Lerner, graduated from Brown and travels to Madrid on a writing fellowship. His second, “10:04,” wrestles with the ethics of creation and procreation under late capitalism through a character who, also like Lerner, is a Brooklyn novelist dealing with the surprise success of his first book. What unites these novels with Lerner’s poetry is a distinctive voice: one ironically detached from the possibility of genuine expression, yet also skeptical of its own scepticism, yearning for a collective lyric.
In some ways, “The Topeka School” is Lerner’s most conventional work. Yet in others, it pushes his struggle with authentic expression further than ever before. Unlike “Atocha” and “10:04,” “The Topeka School” has a plot that approaches normality. Written in the voices of Ivy-bound high school senior Adam Gordon and his psychologist parents, the novel traces Adam’s struggle with the “vacuum at the heart of privilege” that drains the life of upper-middle class white teenagers in 1990s Topeka, Kansas. Slipping into the spaces between the novel’s chapters is a fourth voice, that of Darren Eberhardt, an unintelligent and bigoted teen who serves as a foil to popular, smart, debate-champion Adam. A mysterious act of violence by Darren hovers over the book, a reminder of his status as what Lerner terms the “perverted form of the empire’s privileged subject.”
Lerner himself was a high school debate champion from Topeka, Kansas — an experience he described in a Harper’s essay that anticipates many of the themes of his novel. But while “The Topeka School” may be autofiction, it is not autobiography. On the contrary, the novel is full of instances where language fails to represent reality, where it falls silent or swells with disturbing power, dragging content behind its form. As a child, Adam gets a concussion that leaves him unable to recall simple words; as a teenager, he suffers migraines that return him to this prelinguistic state. In the book’s most disturbing sections, Adam’s identity is twisted by the discursive patterns of toxic masculinity and political doublespeak. But in more encouraging moments, he finds in this same power the beginnings of his passion for poetry.
For Lerner, the ability of linguistic convention to switch places with meaning is deeply concerning. In his Harper’s piece, he decries an “impoverished political discourse” that serves “to naturalize our particular cultural insanity.” This is a concern he shares with the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets of the 60s and 70s, who rejected language’s expressive potential, treating it instead as a sculptural object to be reshaped toward liberatory politics. But Lerner sees an opportunity in this fragmentary language. In the final scene of the novel, an adult Adam takes his kids to an anti-ICE protest that features a “human microphone,” a tactic in which activists chant the words of a speaker to avoid using a permit-requiring PA system. Though embarrassed to be shouting in public, Adam feels the power of this “tiny public speaking, a public learning slowly how to speak again, in the middle of the spread.”
Parts of Lerner’s novel may chafe readers. When he constructs a chapter around a Herman Hesse short story, some may find Lerner pretentious; and when he attacks Donald Trump and toxic masculinity, some may find him too topical, too current. But the strength of Lerner’s novel is the way it undertakes a task it acknowledges to be impossible: the salvage of a Whitmanesque “we” from our polluted national language. Lerner’s character pondered this challenge in “10:04,” but “The Topeka School” is his first prose work to make an attempt to overcome it. Like John Ashbery, Lerner is peering through the convex mirror of our discourse, but still writing — writing towards a truer language on its other side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Amazon rainforest continues to burn, members of Divest Harvard — a student group demanding the University divest from fossil fuels — are renewing their calls on Harvard to withdraw its holdings in farmland across the globe, including in Brazil.
In a statement released last week, Divest Harvard specifically condemned the role Brazilian agribusiness has played in the Amazon fires. The statement noted that, according to a 2018 report by activist group Genetic Resources Action International, the Harvard Management Company — the University’s investing arm — owns 300,000 hectares of land in the Brazilian Cerrado, an area of wooded grasslands that neighbor the Amazon rainforest.
Recent documents cited by Divest Harvard and provided by GRAIN, however, now put that figure closer to 400,000 hectares of land owned by Harvard in Brazil.
“This appropriation of land is both a health and environmental risk and an example of land theft on an enormous scale; it has caused the pollution of local water supplies and poisoning of indigenous territories in Brazil’s bio-diverse Cerrado region,” the Divest Harvard statement read.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan wrote in an emailed statement that HMC is committed to working with locals affected by Harvard’s investments.
“Harvard Management Company focuses on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors for all of its investments, to ensure long-term value for both the asset and the communities in which we invest,” McKiernan wrote. “This commitment to responsible investing involves working with relevant constituents, including local authorities, to address any issues that arise during our investment, even if they predate HMC’s involvement.”
Harvard invests in farming operations through subsidiaries, which Divest Harvard criticized for its contributions to Brazilian agribusiness. Since the fires began to rage in early August, vast deforestation in the Amazon — spurred by farmers seeking land to grow crops and raise cattle — has threatened the loss of species and biodiversity, escalated climate change, and destroyed homes for hundreds of indigenous tribes who live in the rainforest.
“This type of investment in Brazilian agribusiness fuels the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and exacerbates the global climate catastrophe,” the Divest Harvard statement read.
“Harvard is ignoring its responsibility of environmental stewardship and once again choosing profit over the health and well-being of people and the planet.”
McKiernan wrote in his statement that the natural resources team at HMC has “made great progress” in altering the University’s portfolio over the past few years and working with managers of their assets to improve the “land and community.”
“Their aim is to create a more focused and efficient portfolio that, in partnership with local managers, can meet or exceed our quality standards,” McKiernan wrote. “As a result, we have sold a number of assets and are considering selling others.”
The 2018 report published by GRAIN and Rede Social de Justiça e Direitos Humanos, another activist group, estimated that HMC has spent upward of $1 billion to buy up more than 800,000 hectares of land around the world.
HMC expanded its investment in emerging markets from 2005 to 2013, including investing in farmland in Brazil and Uruguay. HMC exited a $150 million investment in forest and farmland in northeast Brazil in March 2018, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.
Campbell Erickson ’21, a member of Divest Harvard, said Harvard’s investments in farmland around the world demonstrate that the endowment is not truly “apolitical” — a refrain often heard from administrators in response to divestment activism.
“It's very hypocritical of Bacow and others in Harvard's leadership to reflect on Harvard as an institution of change, while also defending such abhorrent investment practices as apolitical or not important — unimportant — when really, we see the world kind of reacting to the result of some Harvard's investment practices,” Erickson said.
Divest Harvard has organized environmental activism for years on Harvard’s campus, focusing mainly on Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry.
In another recent press release, Divest Harvard stated their research found that of the 1 percent of the nearly $40 billion endowment that is publicly listed, $5.6 million was invested in the fossil fuel industry. The report also called on Harvard to disclose its investments in the fossil fuel industry, divest from fossil fuels, and reinvest in "socially responsible" funds by Earth Day 2020.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to previous statements made by administrators opposing divestment. University President Lawrence S. Bacow — following the example of previous Harvard presidents — has maintained that the school’s endowment is not an appropriate mechanism to enact social change. Bacow has also argued that the school must work with the fossil fuel industry to fight the threat of climate change and craft environmental policy.
Erickson said the group targeted Harvard agricultural holdings because it wanted to hold the University accountable for all of its investments, including those in farmland.
“It’s important that we hold our institutions accountable, and not let Harvard or the Harvard University endowment act under the radar, and use regressive or colonialist investments to fund themselves,” Erikson said. “And we, you know, I think fundamentally, we believe that the University needs to be held accountable.”
