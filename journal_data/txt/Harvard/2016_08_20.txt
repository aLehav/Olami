After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brent Suter ’12 will make his Major League debut on Friday night for the Milwaukee Brewers. Suter, a 6’5” left-handed pitcher from Cincinnati, will face the Seattle Mariners at 10:10 p.m. at Safeco Field in Seattle.
He will be the second Harvard graduate to pitch in the Major Leagues this week and the 16th Crimson player to appear in an MLB game. Frank Herrmann ’06 was called up by the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday. He threw a scoreless inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday night in what was his first big league action since 2012.
Suter has been a force for the Brewers’ triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, all season. He was 6-6 with a 3.50 earned run average in 16 appearances, 11 of which came as starts. The former Winthrop resident has been dominant of late. Before allowing seven earned runs in his last start, Suter had surrendered just two earned runs in his last 29 and two-thirds innings.
Milwaukee has lost four straight games and six of its last seven. The Brewers sit at 52-68, fourth in the National League Central and 12 games out of the NL’s second wild card spot.
Suter will be the first left-handed pitcher to start for the Brewers in more than three years. Milwaukee has had a righty start its last 474 games.
