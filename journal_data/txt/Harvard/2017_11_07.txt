With over three decades of experience in art history and curation under her belt, Mary McWilliams now serves as Norma Jean Calderwood Curator of Islamic and Later Indian Art at the Harvard Art Museums, where she’s been working since 1998. Her work focuses on art from Islamic countries. She has traveled extensively, learning and researching pieces from Islamic history. McWilliams has contributed her expertise to six museums in her career thus far, including the Negarestan Museum in Tehran, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C., and the National Gallery of Art, also in D.C.. She worked with David Roxburgh, History of Art and Architecture Department Chair, to co-curate the exhibit “Technologies of the Image: Art in 19th-Century Iran,” currently on view in the Harvard Art Museums’ University Research Gallery. McWilliams took The Crimson on a tour of the exhibition and shared her thoughts on curatorial practice at an educational institution.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for lengh and clariy.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you choose to exhibit art from 19th-century Iran in particular?
Mary McWilliams: Well, it’s a wonderful period, and it’s one that we have not been able to focus upon previously… What inspired us to do this project was a visit to Houston about ten years ago. We were working on another project together, David and I: “Traces of the Calligrapher.” As part of that project we went to visit a private collector, and we saw his collection. We were looking at that time at something different—calligrapher’s tools—but we saw that he had this extraordinary collection of 19th-century Iranian art, which had never been published. David and I looked at each other and said, “We really ought to do an exhibition on this.”
THC: How is Qajar art—of the Qajar period of the late Persian empire—usually portrayed in exhibits?
MM: This is not the first project ever to be done in the world on Qajar art, of course, but we wanted it to be a fresh take on this art form, because it has often been denigrated in the past, particularly by European scholars or Westerners who have looked at it as no longer pure or authentic. One of the things we really do try to present, if you read the labels and the catalogue, is that every bit is authentic. It is the practice of Iranian artists for centuries to bring in exotic material and foreign elements and to incorporate them into their visual repertoire, their portfolio of designs. It is also totally characteristic of their working practices to work from intermediaries rather than from studies from life. Using photographs, using lithographs, using prints from Europe—that is very much part of the way they have been working for centuries.
THC: You mentioned that this isn’t the first project of Qajar art in the world, but why do you think this art from this period has been understudied and underappreciated?
MM: I think a large part of it is that Westerners, who have looked at art from this period, have a tendency to see the elements that come from Western art and see that they are used differently and they’re not used in the way you might expect. For example, if you look at images of the Virgin Mary, there are all these “Virgin in the chair” images. Well, what is the woman kneeling with the doves doing there? If you know that particular iconography, you are probably thinking, “They got it wrong.” In fact, they are using it for their own purposes. I like to think about Renoir and Monet to a certain extent went through a period of japonesque. You see these Japanese fans and you see people dressed in kimonos, or you see this emulation of Asian landscape painting. My guess is that the Japanese and Irani looked at these and thought, “Boy, did he get that wrong.” What could be a bigger cliche than a woman holding a fan? But we don’t make fun of those artists. We don’t deride their efforts. We think that that eclecticism is something very interesting. We value that. Why don’t we value it when the Iranian artists are also taking in?
THC: What is different about curating a museum at a university as opposed to another museum at a non-educational institution?
MM: One of the great differences is that we get to write longer labels! That makes a huge difference. In a university museum, we have the opportunity to work with academic faculty and graduate students. I think we are expected to do argument-driven exhibitions, which tend to be text-heavy—at least the ones from my department do. That may be partly because when you’re in a non-Western field, you often feel there is more you need to explain. I think we need to have more text to situate our viewers in time and space but also to bring up what the concepts are that we want to get across. We have more leeway here. When I worked at the Cleveland Museum, we were told that no label should be over 100 words. Basically, if I couldn’t say what I was meant to say in 100 words, then I didn’t know what I was talking about. I just went nuts about this. Harvard Art Museums gives us more leeway and more breathing space to communicate more complex ideas. You can only do so much with 100 words. Some museums are allowed 60 words.

Increasingly now, the lighthouse partsdark wings and a single stream of lighttrickles through like a blade flashedthrough the night. I wandered among
the sea, bobbed among crevices and duckedmy dull head under piers which crawledwith shiny lichen and a fish broken off from schoolsof thought or spurned off a wave’s back.
The lighthouse colors the sea in swaths,a golden limb blinding boats breaking uponthe shore, bliss tasted iron rust in their mouths.Light leveled through shrouds and shades,
sun of the night, blighted watery fieldsnow unable to sleep. Rest, at the end of a song,or between the strokes of arms, I paddledforth into the gleaming brightness—
so hard wanted I—and the beam, as ifmoved by wind, floated southward and I,now dim my shadow wail to wane.

Have you been finding meaning in the smiles of strangers? Do birds seems to hover around you as if you were in a Disney movie? All in all, has life been treating you too well recently? If any of these questions speak to you, consider returning to bitter reality by watching the new Netflix original film, “1922.” Adapted from a Stephen King’s novella, the film explores how despicable humanity can be in an impressively short runtime of an hour and 40 minutes. Not the best thing to stream on date night, “1922” begins with our narrator, Wilfred James (Thomas Jane), confessing to the murder of his wife. Relative to the rest of this downer of a film, however, this initial catalyst is comparable to the first 15 minutes of a teen slasher, in which the characters are less worried about axe murderers than they are about getting laid. As for “1922,” it only gets worse from here on.
Told through flashbacks to the year 1922, the film is shot in an unsettling manner. The camera is extremely personal and close, focusing on the subtleties and mannerisms of each character and character interaction. Adding to these suffocating visuals are shots that are intentionally impeded by corn stalks, plaster, or pelting snow. In a way, the cinematography treats the viewer as an intruder—an unhelpful witness to the heinous crime committed by Wilfred James and its terrible consequences. This film evokes a titillating sense of voyeurism as we view the captivating inner lives of a small rural family. However, this interesting sensation is amplified by hostility towards the viewer. The film’s cinematography is unwelcoming and distant. We know we should look away, but as the film descends into madness, we can’t help but stare.
These claustrophobic visuals are accompanied by a similarly eerie score. The movie indulges itself in slow-burning, reactive ambient music that effortlessly mirrors the action on screen. The score often pieces together the ongoing action of the film and the inner mechanizations of the characters with almost violent changes in tempo and pace.
The acting in the film is superb. As mentioned previously, the intimacy of the cinematography puts each character under a microscope. Faced with this challenge, all the actors in “1922” have subtle mannerisms that add layers to the film’s narrative and emotional appeal. For instance, as Wilfred James stares at his wife’s decomposing body, he starts to quiver at the sight. And while the film’s dialogue is a bit uninspired, the actors have really internalized their lines and deliver them with dramatic gravitas.
Thomas Jane plays the role of Wilfred James to perfection. He delivers a memorable performance and truly embodies our deeply flawed but relatable protagonist. Eliciting sympathy from a wife-murderer is no easy task, but, by the end of the film, it’s hard not to feel for this forsaken individual. Jane’s unique, grizzled voice feels like it could have only been achieved by guzzling steel mesh, and his presence is stoically intimidating. (Not so fun fact: Thomas Jane also played the lead role in an arguably even more depressing Stephen King movie, “The Mist.” Feel free to watch both “1922” and “The Mist” in a “Why did I do this to myself?” double feature.)
“1922” is by no means a gore-fest, but when the film does get bloody, it's to great effect. Blood doesn't gush out violently like in a Quentin Tarantino film, but trickles haphazardly, making every scene feel all too real. The murder scene, in particular, is extremely disturbing in its realism. Arlette’s (Molly Parker) desperate struggle to escape the murderous grasp of her husband is absolutely gruesome. Her death is uncomfortably long, and the camera pulls no punches as we get a full shot of her body convulsing and going limp. This scene is an early indicator that the film won’t have clean conclusions. Murder is messy, and the blood doesn’t wash off easy, as Wilfred James will soon learn.
(PSA: Animal lovers beware! There are a couple of unsettling animal deaths in this movie, so be prepared to watch some farm animals meet some gruesome ends. For cow enthusiasts, Netflix offers the 2006 version of “Charlotte’s Web.”)
Stephen King film adaptations have a reputation for successful transitions to the big screen, and although the screen’s a bit smaller on Netflix, “1922” shines just as bright. The direction and acting is inspired and King’s masterful storytelling takes on a life of its own through the cinematography. Not a movie for the faint of heart, “1922” will disturb you and give you little reason to be hopeful about humanity.

Within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Thor franchise has always been the awkward middle child. Not as narratively driven as “Captain America,” but not as ridiculously fun as “Guardians of the Galaxy,” the God of Thunder has attempted to synthesize the realism of Earth with the fantasy of Asgard, with mixed results. Never truly committed to either of these aesthetics, the past two movies are unmemorable as far as multi-million dollar superhero movies go. Enter “Thor: Ragnarok,” a complete reinvention of the franchise. 
The film follows the odyssey of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) as he attempts to forestall “Ragnarok,” the prophesied destruction of the heavenly civilization of Asgard. Abandoning the monotony of Earth and gloomy, grayscale aesthetics, “Thor: Ragnarok” is a neon interstellar thrill ride that doesn’t take itself too seriously. In addition to the fight between Thor and Hulk that was teased in trailers, “Thor: Ragnarok” offers a slew of colorful, well-choreographed battles of epic proportions, intercut with both visual gags and hilarious lines. A feast for the senses, the film effectively uses CGI to create mesmerizing environments and well-animated foes, complementing these visuals with a high-energy synth score. Not one, but two action scenes are fought with Led Zeppelin's “Immigrant Song” in the background. Two is honestly not enough.
The film wholeheartedly recognizes superhero tropes and lampoons them without restraint. In the very first scene, we expect the film to tread in the direction of “Thor: The Dark World” as a hulking, demon-like beast delivers a villainous monologue to Thor, who is dangling from a chain. However, this worry is quickly dispelled as Thor is awkwardly turned away from the monster by the chain’s rotational momentum. Unlike most attempts at comedic relief in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which are poorly paced and probably contractually stipulated, this scene, along with many others in the film, brings about natural and genuine laughs.
Hemsworth is as charming as ever, and with no forced romantic subplots, he is solely focused on obliterating his enemies with style and cracking witty one-liners. Unlike in the previous Thor movies, however, the secondary characters completely steal the show. Jeff Goldblum plays the Grandmaster, ruler of the garbage planet Sakaar, who imprisons Thor and pits him in a battle against the Hulk. Less of a character and more Jeff Goldblum just being himself, the Grandmaster is an eccentric minor villain who absolutely demands attention when on screen. But the funniest performance comes from the director Taika Waititi himself. Playing a warrior literally made of stone, Waititi uses a quiet New Zealand accent to make his character Korg unintentionally hysterical, delivering soft-spoken lines with a childlike sincerity.
Beyond the cameo, Waititi has given this particularly pedestrian superhero franchise a much-needed face lift. His former directing experience includes mainly New Zealand indie comedies, such as “Eagle vs. Shark” and (the absolutely hilarious) “What We Do in the Shadows,” so giving him the directorial reins of a major Marvel franchise was not the most intuitive production decision. This bold choice, however, has paid off in the film. Distancing himself from the often shoehorned comedic relief that Marvel films are known for, Waititi gives his film a particular comedic flare that pairs nicely with the ridiculous amount of action packed into this feature.
Despite continuing box office success, Marvel Studios has been criticized for their films’ formulaic nature. The critical and financial success of “Thor: Ragnarok”, which is 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and has garnered $121 million domestically in its opening weekend, proves that a new studio philosophy of greater directorial liberty and creative control will please critics and regular moviegoers alike. The fantastic film has breathed life into both the Thor franchise and the aging Marvel Cinematic Universe.

In “Mean,” Myriam Gurba writes, “Art is one way to work out touch gone wrong.” That is fitting, as her memoir is a kind of collage, a bulletin board onto which she has pinned the cut–up memories of her life. She takes these fragments of her life and connects them with the fingerprints that others have left on her body. Analyzing her experience through the lens of her identity as a queer, mixed-race Chicana feminist, Gurba navigates these intersections with honesty and humor. Her memoir examines themes of gender, race, and sexual assault in a way so accessible and raw that it challenges us to see each of the three not as distant concepts, but as tangible realities. Each story, each memory, reaches out and touches us. “Mean” is, more than anything, a memoir of touch.
The memoir opens with the touch of a ghost. Sophia Torres was raped and beaten to death in a park in Gurba’s hometown of Santa Maria on November 15, 1996. Gurba’s form morphs from poetic verse into a vivid description of Torres’s assault. And much of her memoir floats between verse, prose, and inserted police or news reports. She writes of feeling Sophia’s lingering presence. “Guilt is a ghost,” she writes, “Sometimes, in my car, I realize I’ve been listening to this Mexican music I’m not really into … I think, ‘Why am I listening to this? I don’t even like this.’ Then I’ll remember: Sophia...” In telling her own story, Gurba tells Sophia’s too. Tucked within the pages of her novel is a eulogy to a woman she never met and yet, through the touch of another, is tied to forever.
In middle school, a boy touches Myriam Gurba beneath the desk. Youth is no utopia, nor is it an excuse, and its controversies are on trial here. Gurba calls out behavior for what it is, and does not lie about her response. Nagged by the memory of unasked-for hands on her body, she finds new hands to cover them up. The layers pile up beneath the high school bleachers until the offending handprints can no longer be felt. When a boy puts his genitals in a gopher hole on the playground, she does not laugh or mock. She writes, “He sexually assaulted it and they took him away in an ambulance.” There is little empathy or coddling in her description. The boy put his genitals where they did not belong, just as the other boy put his hands where they did not belong, where they did not have permission to enter. She names this sexual assault. Her language is intentional, with no room for exception. It treats everyone and everything the same.
Race and gender, in “Mean,” are backdrops, targets, and breaths. They are transient and they are trained. Gurba drinks black coffee and tastes masculinity. She stays with a friend and writes, “The things in her room were teaching Emily how to be a woman.” Again, she is intentional, identifying the constricting influence of gender roles in even the most seemingly innocuous of circumstances. Even death has a gender: “She likes to flirt.” As a child, Gurba is targeted for her Mexican heritage. She says of one prejudiced elementary schooler, “She was checking to see if I breathed in English or some other language. Breaths do happen in different languages. They are onomatopoetry.” She marries her two languages of English and Spanish together, never letting you forget how proud she is to be Mexican and how beautiful her culture is.
The most evocative parts of Gurba’s memoir, and the most difficult to read, are those in which she deals with unwanted touch. Her strength in retelling her own assault is not only the climax, but a breaking point: It is where the novel splits in two. The novel becomes, save some jumping back and forth through time, a before and after. The fault line is a sidewalk crack at midday, the spot where she is attacked. Her reflection is heart-wrenching, yet she still maintains her ability to detach from what she is describing and probe it to find the wider implications. “Somewhere on this planet, a man is touching a woman to death,” she writes, “Somewhere on this planet, a man is about to touch a woman to death.” Her observations and her experiences are completely uncensored, and her memoir is better for it.
Hauntingly, beautiful, and refreshingly blunt, Gurba’s “Mean” is an open door through which she invites you to experience her life, in all its beauty and struggle. I suggest you walk through it.

In the world of Tom Hanks’s short story collection, “Uncommon Type,” college students happily go surfing with Dad on their birthdays. Women move to idyllic suburbs where children are “out there, teeming, laughing, bolting to and fro in various shades of flesh.” Four friends build a rocket ship in their backyard, fly to the moon, and come safely home again. For Hanks, the greenest grass is in America, where everyone is well-intentioned, everything is clean, and every ending is happy. “Uncommon Type” is almost surreal in its total escapism. Hanks creates a world anyone would want to live in—and one that is a far cry from the real thing.
It may be too easy to ascribe such theatricality to Tom Hanks, of all people. The author is the elephant in the room: it is hard to go long without attaching his face to a narrator, or reading a sentence in his voice. Certainly, the folksiness of Hanks’s tone evokes the bumbling character type—like Forrest Gump—that the author has so famously played in movies. In print, as on screen, Hanks portrays everymen. They are charming—but they aren’t complex.
Still, Hanks’s enthusiasm is endearing. He writes truly pleasant stories, ones without a hint of cynicism. With mixed results, he is also not afraid to indulge his own interests. Hanks describes certain topics with obsessive procedural detail. He outlines, for example, the minutiae of paddleboarding or press tours. For better or worse, Hanks quickly remedies any possible ignorance—he leaves no stone unturned when it comes to his pet subjects. World Wars I and II come up repeatedly, as does outer space. And of course, there are the typewriters: One appears in every story, the gimmick that ties the collection together.
If the book has a singular Achilles heel, it is that Hanks’s ethos of enthusiastic haplessness permeates the writing. On a line-to-line basis, “Uncommon Type” often falls flat.  Hanks’s folksy vocabulary is by turns charming (as in the use of the word “chockablock”) and grating (as in that word’s endless repetition). His sentences ring a little too colloquial: Yes, people talk with comma splices, but that doesn’t mean they are nice to read. Hanks also has an affinity for the word “being” (as a gerund) when a different construction would be more readable.  His constant use of exclamation points is too much.  This is not a work to examine at length; it does best when read quickly and without much thought.
Notably, the book is at its weakest when Hanks describes female characters. This is a rare occurrence: of sixteen stories, only three feature a female lead. Unfortunately, having even fewer would have served the writing quality (if not the Bechdel test). Hanks’s women are mostly “strong”—that is to say, they do not fumble or stutter the way the men do. But fumbling and stuttering are what Hanks writes best. They make up the one character type that he excels at. For some reason, and to the book’s detriment, Hanks has decided that the ordinary-Joe (or Jane) is a role women shouldn’t play.
“Uncommon Type” has flaws. The stories can be unrealistic and unartistic, with a one-trick pony of a character type and a simplistic moral outlook. But if Hanks has one story, then at least it is a comforting one. This is a book about nostalgia—every time a typewriter appears, at least one character greets it with enthusiasm. Smartphones are acknowledged, but mostly looked down upon. One story is set in a halcyon 1950s; in another, the protagonist time-travels back to a bucolic 1939. Immigrants and Broadway hopefuls travel to New York City to make their ways, and they succeed. The suburbia of the American Dream really exists. People are happy without being ambitious. They are satisfied. They are content. This is the conceit of the text: Some things are worth slowing down for.
Is Hanks’s book one of them? Not really, but there are far worse worlds to immerse oneself in for a little while. This is an anthology of undiluted escapism, and it plays that role with brio. Hanks makes the reader’s job easy.  “Uncommon Type” is always simple—but in its better moments, it avoids being derivative. The author tells classic stories in a palatable way. So if you have a few hours on an especially gloomy afternoon, when thinking sounds difficult, give “Uncommon Type” a try. Visit a world where America has always been and will always be great. It’s not realistic—but that’s the charm.

The North American premiere of “Obsidian Tear” was quite a night for Finnish artists, featuring performances filled with equal parts darkness and grandeur. This was the Boston Ballet’s opening show for its 2017 season. This production showcases the work of multi-award winning British choreographer Wayne McGregor and Boston Ballet’s Finnish resident choreographer Jorma Elo. McGregor’s beautiful piece features nine male dancers dancing to the haunting music of Finnish composer Esa-Pekka Salonen’s “Lachen Verlernt” and “Nyx.” The second half of the program pairs Elo’s dynamic choreography with the music of Jean Sibelius, the famed Finnish composer, in honor of the centennial of Finland’s independence.
The show opened on a majestic note with an orchestral performance of Jean Sibelius's tone poem “Finlandia.” Daniel Stewart of the Santa Cruz Symphony, who was selected by Salonen himself to serve as guest conductor, led the orchestra. They played this piece with a grandness that brought it to life, with a particularly strong and robust performance from the horn section. At times the music felt slightly too heavy, but on the whole the orchestra did justice to an exquisite piece of music.
McGregor’s “Obsidian Tear” followed the overture, which opened with two bare chested male dancers in billowing pants of black and vibrant scarlet. Their movements were filled with a harshness and suspension that perfectly matched the jutting dissonance in “Lachen Verlernt,” Salonen’s eerie violin solo. During this duet, the dancers constantly mimicked each other, but as soon as the motif became recognizable, they broke away from synchronized movements into entirely unexpected and opposite choreography. The two dancers travelled across the space almost like magnets, with constant pushing and pulling apart. The suspension and control of these movements was impressive, as if the bodies were moving through water with their costumes billowing around them like sails. The title of the piece plays on the two meanings of tear—tear as in weeping, and also as in ripping. Though these two meanings may be gleaned in the choreography, the manner in which they are embedded is deliberately ambiguous. The “ripping” theme seems to appear more prevalently when the rest of the male dancers join the stage. The rest of the nine dancers were also clothed in pants and tunics of black, in various levels of dishevelment. Their movements lacked synchronization, but were characterized by a strength and power that at times felt fatalistic, each movement necessary to propelling the dance forward. There was a constant juxtaposition: At time they swarmed around the dancer in red as if attacking him, at others they seem to envelope and caress in a strangely gentle way as if to make him join them. They also scattered across the stage at astonishing speeds as if shattering, and came together in a lulling swell to perform incredible lifts.
The bare set, with its dark lighting slowly fading to red, was effective, as it focused all the attention on the dancers’ movements—the strange contortions and feats of strength. Irlan Silva, who performed the part of the dancer in red, gave an exceptionally moving performance. During the piece’s climax, he climbed a ramp before being pushed over an abyss by one of the dancers in black. Silva’s demeanor continued this dark theme of fatalism that characterized the performance overall. The resulting performance felt dangerous, violent and enigmatic. The choice of an all-male performance seemed to emphasize this violence, with dancers often appearing like troops in the midst of an ambush.
Elo’s “Fifth Symphony of Jean Sibelius” was much lighter, and a striking contrast to the first part of the performance. Its choreography was distinctly more classical and featured the corps de ballet as well as a range of duets. While the first performance felt strangely cohesive, despite its vastly contrasting rhythms, “Fifth Symphony” did not feel as connected with the music as the first piece did. The individual performances from each pair were beautiful, but not particularly distinctive. As the corps de ballet could sometimes be unsynchronized or unexciting, the primary soloist Ashley Ellis was a breath of fresh air. She brought more life to this piece with her lightness and grace. The production felt short, perhaps because the music did not quite match up to the style of the choreography. For this reason, it did not have the same power that “Obsidian Tear” had.
Altogether, Boston Ballet’s beautiful show is worthy of congratulatory remarks, and showcases the music of the composers it features wonderfully. While “Fifth Symphony” of Jean Sibelius lacked the strength that so distinguished “Obsidian Tear,” the two pieces were equally successful in showcasing the talent of their performers and delighting their audience.

On Maroon 5’s latest album, frontman Adam Levine screams, “Help me out.” They definitely need it. Maroon 5 dropped their sixth studio album, “Red Pill Blues,” on Nov. 3. The album signifies the conclusion of the band’s gradual shift from a pop rock band of the first half of the 2000s to a washed-up pure pop group of the late 2010s.
Of course, one can never judge a work by its cover, but in this case the tacky and childish album artwork is hard to ignore. Each of the seven members (yes, seven—it takes a few times counting to make sure they didn’t mess up while naming themselves) is photographed using a different snapchat filter. It’s as if there was no artistic interpretation put into the cover, let alone the music. The album cover is actually a perfect way to show how the group is trying to stay modern but looking like fools doing so.
Regardless of the cover artwork, “Red Pill Blues” is different to listen to. One must put oneself in the mentality to listen to pop music, of course, but even that doesn’t make it much better. It is undeniable that Adam Levine (the only important one) has a beautiful voice, but this is album is like listening to the first 15 tracks of a 12-year-old’s playlist.
The band has, without a doubt, sold out. Maybe music-industry complexities are to blame, but Maroon 5 clearly lost their artistic vision over the years and have turned to trying to create songs for radio play, not the message behind it. Taking a look from “Songs About Jane” to “Red Pill Blues,” it is as if they were created by two completely different bands. This is not necessarily a problem, but in this case Maroon 5’s transition to something new wasn’t a transition to something good.
The tracklist is fairly weak. The premise of every single song has to do with getting a girl, losing a girl, or wanting that girl back. “Wait,” “Lips on You,” and “Girls Like You” are honestly just a distasteful continuation of one another.
While the tracklist is weak, the album does have notable features with good verses, though they couldn’t really save the album. The glorious SZA features on “What Lovers Do,” and while this is one of the better tracks, it still makes no impact on the rest of the album. Other features like A$AP Rocky, as well as Kendrick Lamar and Future, on bonus-track singles “Don’t Wanna Know” and “Cold,” respectively, were there to give a “cool factor” to the music and did the opposite. Unhelpfully, the songs Future and Kendrick were on wore out their welcome this summer with excessive radio play.
The album does not say much. It isn’t cohesive, and that’s really the problem. It’s just several pop songs thrown together in hopes of making a quick dollar. Listening to this album didn’t create thought or provoke anger; it really just caused frustration because of the waste of time listening. It will go down as another forgotten album, and show how far the group has fallen since “Songs about Jane.”

“All’s fair in love and war, until you say it isn’t, but you’re wrong.” That line from the middle of “Lemmings,” the penultimate song on Blink-182’s “Dude Ranch,” is probably the best way to summarize the album. Blink-182’s pre-breakthrough album, which turned 20 this summer, is a strange mix of heartbreak, revelry in loserdom, and toilet humor. It was never an album that anyone would’ve predicted would shape punk music for years to come, but it did. It has become a classic, the success of which allowed Blink-182 to become a premier pop-punk group. “Dude Ranch” either embodies the implicit douchebaggery in every Nice Guy™ looking for love or it works beautifully as a coming-to-terms with being toxic.
Early Blink-182 could most effectively be characterized as the “Captain Underpants” of bands. Everything they did felt a little like a dirty joke. Founded by guitarist and co-lead singer Tom DeLonge, bassist and co-lead singer Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor, Blink-182 quickly became a San Diego favorite and eventually released the album “Cheshire Cat,” probably the best example of an album that works as a brilliant act of intentional terribleness (See: “Just About Done.”) As the band began touring, they realized they were too popular for their label, which refused to see them as anything other than a joke, and signed a deal with MCA Records for their next album, after being promised full creative freedom.
That creative freedom actually made Blink-182 more cohesive. On “Dude Ranch,” everything’s in sync. The band debuted the glossy, polished sound that made them famous, making every guitar lick sound epic. Blink-182’s only weakness is its vocals. DeLonge’s is notoriously nasally, and while it works most of the time, there are moments it’s especially grating, like on the closer “I’m Sorry,” where it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Hoppus, whose voice was ordinarily a clean bass, was quitting smoking at the time, and he sounds raspy, especially on songs like “Dammit.” Nonetheless, the sharp writing makes up for some of this. Hoppus and DeLonge are both clever lyricists and goofs at heart.
The album sets the theme brilliantly with “Pathetic,” an energetic rocker about a girl who calls the protagonist the same as everyone else and pathetic for thinking otherwise. The rest of “Dude Ranch” is largely about being a “Nice Guy” over the course of failed relationships and attempts to woo girls. The protagonist feels a sense of entitlement towards women he’s interested in because he believes he’s a better person than the guys these women date. Over the course of “Dude Ranch,” the protagonist gradually understands that he’s wrong and atones.
DeLonge and Hoppus fill different roles to make the theme palatable: DeLonge is the immature delinquent while Hoppus is the sadboy loser, the entitled protagonist who gets sad when things don’t go his way. DeLonge helps flesh this character out and give comic relief as a comically bad person who tries without avail to be good. For example, take “Voyeur.” DeLonge sings about being a peeping Tom while his situation gradually becomes more ridiculous (“I’ve made mistakes by looking in the wrong window / Her dad is big and I’ve never seen his face,” “My lady’s so sweet, she likes to entertain”). While DeLonge has moments of earnestness, they usually still feel immature, like “Enthused,” in which he vents about a girl who doesn’t realize he’s into her, or “Dick Lips,” in which he bemoans his parents’ anger at him for showing up drunk to a dance and getting kicked out of school. Because DeLonge acts as Blink-182’s frontman, “Dude Ranch” is able to explore the theme with a sort of comic touch.
Hoppus acts as a far more serious protagonist. His songs feature the central figure seeking something more from those around him and becoming frustrated when they or he inevitably falls short of his expectations. There’s a gradual realization, however, that what he wants is a girlfriend who will put up with his mediocre self. The climax of this realization is on “Josie,” in which Hoppus literally describes his ideal girlfriend.
“Dude Ranch” is all about the realization of this entitlement, as the album builds to an epiphany that the protagonist is a bad person. It’s a narrative that sounds murky and toxic, but one that Blink-182 mostly pulls off through the brightness and hookiness of DeLonge’s guitar work. By keeping everything lyrically simple, Blink-182 is able to be catchy despite their darker material. While this fails on tracks like “Boring” and “Emo,” it works resoundingly well for the rest of the album. “Dude Ranch” thus acts as a cheerful work of pop-punk sadness. It was the launching pad for Blink-182’s success, and their next two albums were smash hits and sounded like glossier versions of “Dude Ranch.” While the sound has become tremendously influential, no band since has been able to make the Nice Guy so likable. For all the accomplishments the band had, this one may be the most impressive.

Elvis Costello always felt a bit out of place. A late-comer to the original golden era of punk who looked like a dorkier Buddy Holly and sang like Roy Orbison with a bad cold, Costello confounded in his context. Compared to the intentional stupidity or wildness of contemporaries like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, Costello felt more cerebral. Even when he was rebellious, becoming the first artist ever banned from “Saturday Night Live,” it was only because he stopped playing a song he was scheduled to play. At the beginning of his career, Costello was able to combine his cleverness with the intensity and craft of a frustrated nerd. No album showcases this better than his debut, “My Aim is True,” an album that turned 40 this summer and challenged the very idea of what punk could be.
“My Aim is True” was the product of half a decade of Costello’s toiling in the British music scene, working a variety of day jobs and playing pub rock, an early variation of punk, at night. Recorded with the backing band Clover, which more or less became Huey Lewis and The News, “My Aim is True” sounds like far less campy and far more emotional punk. But Costello took from a wide variety of genres, especially blues and early rock. Throughout the album, he sounds more like the last of the initial wave of British Invasion than punk. While the punk elements are all present—the fast guitars, Costello’s delightful snarl—the real unifying feature of “My Aim is True” is the way every song allows Costello to show off his songwriting craft.
Lyrically, few artists have ever been as clever on an album as Costello was on his debut. While the album was about sexual and political struggles, Costello’s biting humor and nerdy aesthetic make the album’s tone one of dark comedy. Growing up, I was always fascinated by the way Costello used “dancing” as a euphemism for sex. Costello is able to play on the dancing theme throughout the album, like on “Mystery Dance,” where he attempts to figure out how to pleasure himself, but nobody seems to know. That’s the tip of the iceberg. From the brilliant masturbation joke that serves as the opening lyric (“Now that your picture’s in the paper being rhythmically admired”) to “I don’t know if you’ve been loving somebody / I only know it isn’t mine” to my all-time favorite line: “I said, ‘I’m so happy I could die’ / She said, ‘drop dead’ and left with another guy,” Costello constructs genius wordplay and makes it feel effortless, even on the more political tracks. On the masterpiece “Less Than Zero,” Costello satirizes the duplicity of Oswald Mosley and his fascist movement as secretive teenage sex, wherein Mosley attempts to hide his racist past and other character flaws from the public, much like teenagers would hide sex from their parents. The only point on the album when he stumbles is in the second verse of the otherwise spectacular “Waiting for the End of the World.” He sounds like he’s cramming too much into half the lines. Aside from this section, “My Aim is True” is brilliant lyric-driven music, like that of Springsteen or Dylan, although where Springsteen was descriptive and Dylan was poetic, Costello was darkly comic.
“My Aim is True” additionally distinguished itself by being so different from its genre or anything mainstream at the time. Dominant artists like Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Wonder traditionally released albums that had more cohesive sounds, but Costello was more eclectic. Even in punk, the speed and friendliness of bands like the Ramones contrast with Costello’s intensity and musicality. Costello was one of the first artists to ever create an album so varied. While pub and punk rock were the most prominent, “Mystery Dance,” “Blame It on Cain,” “Pay It Back,” and “Sneaky Feelings” all have blues elements, and “Mystery Dance” also borrows heavily from ’50s rock. “Watching the Detectives” even has reggae elements. More than anything else, however, “My Aim is True” brought power pop and new wave to the mainstream with songs like “Alison” and “Less Than Zero.” His sound was so new that critics were using these terms just to describe him. While his subsequent albums had a diminished energy level and musicality, “My Aim is True” stands as a monument to what Costello could accomplish on every level of his craft.
While there’s some debate on just how well “My Aim is True” stacks up against the rest of his discography, it is nonetheless an undisputed classic. Along with bands like the Talking Heads and Blondie, Costello helped make New Wave popular, and bands like the Cars and Cheap Trick rode the new structures of power pop to prominence. But while it had immediate influence, Costello on “My Aim is True” can be heard throughout the punk rock revival movement. While the leaders of the movement, Blink-182 and Green Day, drew more from the other prominent punks of the period (Blink mostly from the Ramones and Green Day from the Clash and Sex Pistols), Costello can be felt on cerebral rock bands’ albums, like early Weezer and Fountains of Wayne (if you doubt me, compare “Bright Future in Sales” to “Less Than Zero”). Through sheer craft, Costello was able to make a timeless classic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taylor Swift’s sixth studio album, “Reputation,” comes out Nov. 10. To hold you over in the meantime, we’re taking a look back at the previous albums of this country darling turned pop music superstar—and deciding once and for all which Taylor Swift album is truly the best of the best.
5. Taylor Swift (2006)
Taylor Swift’s self-titled debut album is beautiful on its own, but pushed to the bottom of the list by the increasing strength of her later work. The decidedly country record spoke to innocent crushes, first love, and feeling small in a big world, all perfectly suited to the young teenage girl who wrote it. Set almost exclusively to acoustic guitar, it encompasses all the most awkward and beautiful parts of high school. Showcasing her incomparable relatability from the start, the lyrics on her first album may not be the her most complex, but they didn’t have to be for every young girl to turn up the volume on her portable CD player or iPod (the highest honor bestowed upon any musician in 2006) and sing along. One of the album’s most successful singles was “Teardrops on My Guitar,” a bittersweet testament to the unrequited high school crush in all its watching-him-watching-her-in-the-hallway agony. Looking back, it’s honest in the most painfully awkward and precious way. “Our Song” is a cute ode to the honeymoon phase of a young relationship going right. The album incorporates a lovely recurring theme of associating crushes and relationships with particular songs or musicians. Listening to “Taylor Swift” feels like being 15 again and “falling in love” with that kid in your Spanish class who doesn’t know you exist or not knowing who you are and accepting that it might take some time to figure out. In terms of Taylor Swift’s appeal, talent, and staying power, her first album was only the beginning.

4. Speak Now (2010)
Swift’s fourth studio album finds itself, appropriately, fourth in the rankings. While not a bad album—it’s hard to call any of Taylor Swift albums “bad”—it doesn’t stray far from “Fearless,” and if anything, it takes a step back. The musicality is much the same as her second album, acoustic or sometimes electric guitars, and a mix of ballads and more upbeat numbers with more emphasis on the former. Taylor violates her tried-and-true balance of a few standout, quality singles in a lineup of other songs that play off the more popular ones. The single “Mean,” which Taylor Swift performed at the 54th Grammys, is an anomaly in Swift’s repertoire. Its overly simple lyrics and banjo melody don’t particularly compel or impress. While some tracks are too long and lyrically lacking, the album is saved by its better songs. While “Dear John” clocks in at almost seven minutes, it is an honest and biting account of the demise of a relationship, presumably her own with musician John Mayer, and an example of Swift’s relatable and sometimes heartbreaking songwriting. “Back to December” and “Story of Us” are both well-written and performed tracks, the latter receiving much less attention than it was due. “Back to December” is one of those rare Taylor Swift songs that takes an introspective look at responsibility for the end of a relationship, and “Story of Us” is just purely fun to listen to. “Speak Now” may not be as adventurous as Swift’s other albums, but it’s heartfelt and easy to like.

3. Fearless (2008)
Still speaking from youth and innocence, but with more of a bite than her first album, “Fearless” comes up third in Swift’s catalog. The strongest of her original country-inspired trilogy, it masters the form of the softer ballads prominent on her first album and adds grittier, more angsty tracks to contrast them. “Fearless” is a move away from her debut persona of a cutesy, starry-eyed ingenue to someone with more depth, and the music and lyrics reflect this. Her production, while still largely acoustic, expanded to more electric guitar and some well-placed banjo. “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” were the album’s greatest successes, the first an enchanting take on forbidden love and the second an upbeat track with a self-explanatory title. “Love Story” retells Romeo and Juliet without being cheesy, a feat pretty hard to accomplish with a source material so over-referenced. It’s a lovely song, and the melody and tone of her voice evoke the drama and ecstasy of young romance. “You Belong With Me” is the first and quintessential Taylor Swift drag, the ancestor of her later singles like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” The song’s a better-executed reflection on the same “high-stakes” high school crushes she tackles in her first album. Well-organized and well-written, “Fearless” is Taylor Swift’s best work as a purely country performer and the go-to if you miss the days of cutesy, country-rockin’, acoustic Taylor Swift.

2. 1989 (2014)
“1989” marked the final transition of Taylor Swift from country music to pop, and it did so with a bang. The singer partnered with Jack Antonoff, former member of Fun and one of the most sought-after producers in pop music, to create an ’80s-influenced pop album complete with synthesizers, processed instrumentation, and heavy basslines. She took her standard break-up song—and it is truly “her” break-up song, because she’s owned the trope like no other—and set it on fire. “Blank Space” is Swift’s take on the catchy, driving-with-the-windows-down song of the summer, and an effective middle finger to anyone and everyone who criticizes how she manages her love life. “Boys only want love if it’s torture,” she croons cynically, almost as if rolling her eyes–and that cynicism is part of what makes “1989” so different from her other albums. “Shake It Off” does the same thing. Taylor Swift owns all the criticism and laughs at it, and it’s absolutely infectious. Such a sudden and profound shift in style can’t come without some sacrifice; in the case of this album, that sacrifice is the lyrics. They feel more cryptic and more guarded than those of her previous albums. But while Swift lost something in personal depth, she gained it back in mystery and fantasy that match well with the softer tone of much of the album. “1989” was a strong foot planted in the genre of pop music and a declaration that she won’t be leaving anytime soon.
1. Red (2012)
“Red” is a masterpiece of a poetic, catchy country-pop album. Its lyrics, sound, and concept are Taylor Swift’s best to date. Swift knows her audience well, and nowhere is this clearer than on “Red.” Her commercially successful singles, like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “22,” may have frustrated more skeptical listeners. But they became pop anthems and satisfied her larger fan base. Each individual track stands on its own merits while contributing to the album’s larger themes and sound, a genre-bending account of the emotions and memories she associates with the color red. She straddles pop and country effortlessly, experimenting within each and marrying them together. While not as popular as her more mainstream singles, the artistic standout is the soft, crescendoing “All Too Well.” With a loud, persistent drumbeat contrasting her softer voice until it rises in pitch and intensity at the song’s bridge, the nostalgic and at times accusatory song comes across more like a poem. In this song, as in others on “Red,” Swift ventured farther into storytelling than she had previously. In the songs “Starlight” and “The Lucky One,” Swift is an observer a la Billy Joel, telling other people’s stories as she sees them from a distance, but without completely detaching herself. Even her more personal numbers are saturated with this feeling of reflection or “looking back.” Also impressive are her collaborations with other artists. Swift’s duets “The Last Time” and “Everything Has Changed,” with Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran, respectively, are two of the best tracks on the album. The first is haunting and the second is soft and sweet, but each manages to add something more to an album not at all lacking in depth or in quality. While color as a concept isn’t new, she wore it well. Everything on her album, at the risk of sounding cliché, feels bright, angry, broken, and, ultimately, “red.”

Even though this year’s recruiting season coming to a close, questions continue over the morality of entering corporate America through consulting or finance. We welcome efforts to bring these questions to the forefront of campus conversation, including the Harvard Foundation and Office of Career Services’s event this week, aptly named, “Selling Out: Corporations in a Moral Perspective.”
After all, a large percentage of graduating seniors each year choose to go down the recruiting path. Among the Class of 2017, 36 percent of seniors were going into consulting or finance after graduation.
Students enter these industries for different reasons. For low-income students, it is often about accessing financial stability for themselves as well as for their families. For international and undocumented students,  it can often be used as a way of securing a pathway to citizenship or a visa to be allowed to work in the country. It may also be a path for students who are trying to obtain financial security in order to sponsor family members for a green card.
There’s a lot of stigma around “selling out,” but it is important to acknowledge that going into careers that are not as financially stable, such as non-profit work, can be a privilege that many students can’t afford. Students should be empowered to pursue careers that are meaningful for them and also meet their needs. OCS and corporations who recruit on campus create pipelines to finance and consulting; these don’t exist for other career paths, foreclosing alternative possibilities for some students.
As a leader in higher education, Harvard should take further steps to create opportunities in other fields that are available to students. Harvard should better educate students on the nuances of popular fields like finance and consulting while also having wide ranging discussions about career paths. Careers in consulting and finance can reinforce a competitive atmosphere that some say doesn’t necessarily exist in other areas. There needs to also be a conversation on the emotional toll that attempting to break into these careers can take on students, especially with the possibility or reality of rejection.
With all of this in mind, it is important that students not invest their sense of self-worth into companies’ fickle decisions. We hope that the Foundation and OCS event will encourage discourse around the herd mentality of these careers as well as conversations about the role that the morality of wealth plays in this trend. We encourage OCS, along with others who help students find careers, to think about the values behind the career paths they promote to students.

The National Hockey League, for all its history of drawing European talent to North America, is rife with xenophobia on the part of English-speaking Americans and Canadians. The 2015-2016 season was the first time the percentage of Canadian players, never mind North American ones, fell below 50 percent. In that season, North Americans still constituted almost 75 percent of the NHL’s talent. This is a league in which the best-known commentator is notorious for disparaging Russian players en masse. And as a recent ESPN article revealed, the NHL’s North American players and management are just as much part of the problem as anyone else.
While Major League Baseball mandates that every team have full-time Spanish interpreters, some NHL teams forego interpreters to “force” players to learn English. Chicago Blackhawks stars Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane said they faked Russian accents when speaking English to their Russian teammate Artemi Panarin—an idea as unhelpful as it is offensive. On the other hand, Boston Bruins captain Zdeno Chára, who is Slovakian, speaks a total of seven languages in order to better accommodate new teammates.
I can only imagine what it must be like for a professional athlete to be thrown into an unfamiliar culture—I’ve had a similar experience, but certainly not one so dramatic. English is my first language, but it’s not my native language. I come from a fairly Westernized environment in India, where English is pretty widely spoken as a result of British colonization. Moving to America for college still holds a culture shock. I spent the beginning of my freshman year second-guessing everything from my accent to my habits. I wondered if knowing where I’m from changes the way people see me.
It’s even in the little things. When I forget what a megaphone is called because it’s never been a part of my regular vocabulary, I worry that it makes me sound ignorant. For NHL players from outside North America, this move also involves a foreign locker room, surrounded by fans who can’t understand you and teammates who can’t understand you either. It’s no surprise that this culture sends some players right back to their home countries.
The ESPN story also provides little to no commentary on the casual xenophobia players exhibit in that article itself. The title itself reads “Lost in translation: How players bridge hockey’s language barrier,” and quotes nine English-speaking North Americans and just three athletes from across the pond. One stands out as particularly egregious—Canadian Tyler Seguin said “you just put your foot down” because the players are “in North America” and aren’t going to “have a team of cliques.”
There’s a powerful sense of entitlement in demanding that a newcomer to your country learn to assimilate without help, support, or an effort to accommodate them. There’s a strong undercurrent of prejudicial paranoia in thinking any group of people speaking a language you can’t understand are talking about you. And while there’s some dispute about whether or not xenophobia is a form of racism, it’s certainly a form of ostracizing those who are different culturally. Apparently, only one North American in that article could see that.
Anyone new to an English-speaking country takes comfort in hearing the language of their homeland. In the words of Finland native Tuukka Rask of the Boston Bruins, “you’re thinking Finnish words instead of English words.” It can be much more difficult to express yourself in a language you picked up than in one you grew up with.
A first language isn’t an exclusive club designed to leave anyone out. For newcomers to North America, it’s a welcome beacon in a sea of uncertainty—a sea in which it feels like everyone else is in a clique they weren’t invited to join. European hockey revolutionized the NHL and made it the fast, exciting game it is today. But perhaps more importantly, if the NHL—or any league—truly wants to promote inclusivity and diversity, it would do well to think about how it speaks of the European hockey stars of the future.

In light of recent comments about the Fellows and Study Groups Program at the Institute of Politics, we are writing to explain how the program operates and its fundamental purpose.
As the student chairs, we believe that the Fellows and Study Groups Program provides Harvard students with unparalleled opportunities to engage with political practitioners in an immersive experience.
Each semester, we bring six individuals to live on campus for a semester as Resident Fellows. They host weekly study groups (which are open to anyone), hold office hours, serve as mentors to their six student liaisons, attend student group events, and immerse themselves in the Harvard community for the three months they are here. We also bring several individuals (like Sean Spicer) to campus for a shorter period of time as Visiting Fellows. These individuals are are scheduled for as many events as possible during their short time here, participating in events ranging from meetings with faculty to dinners and discussions with students.
It is our job to connect Fellows with the broader Harvard campus and ensure that interested students have an opportunity to engage with each of our Fellows. One of the best things about the Fellows and Study Groups Program is that we allow students to interact and learn from Fellows in small settings. This allows for the most candid conversation possible and provides individuals with a chance to engage in direct discussion, something that is not possible in larger settings. In keeping with this goal, we intentionally keep events small to preserve this special opportunity for students. As undergraduates ourselves, we feel so fortunate to be able to have experiences like these and understand how unique the Harvard IOP Fellows and Study Groups Program is.
As a program that values thoughtful discourse, we are glad to see that other students have voiced their opinions and sparked a discussion. However, in order to address the recent criticisms leveled at Sean Spicer’s fellowship, we feel it is important to clarify the details of his visit and Corey Lewandowski’s current one.
A visiting fellowship being entirely off the record is not out of the ordinary. While on the record events are certainly valuable in their own way―and Corey Lewandowski has two on his schedule for Monday, November 6―they are simply not the central purpose of the Fellows and Study Groups Program. A number of Resident and Visiting Fellows participate in events that are on the record, most commonly Forums. When building a Fellow’s schedule, we try to use the Fellow’s time in a way that is most valuable for the broader Harvard community, so we therefore prioritize event structures that are unique to our program. While large speaking engagements have value, the Fellows and Study Groups program is not meant to serve as a stop on a speaking tour.
With many of our Fellows, interest in attending events far exceeds the number of spots available. Sean Spicer was one of these Fellows. As such, we had to conduct lotteries for his public events. Open spots were offered to the broader Harvard community using the IOP Announce mailing list. This email list is the same tool that is used to publicize all public IOP events (and was used on October 31 to announce the dates of Corey Lewandowski’s visit). In these lotteries, spots are given to a wide array of students at Harvard, but preference is given to active IOP members in recognition of the commitment they have demonstrated.
We hope this helps to clarify how we make the decisions we do regarding our program. We hope to see you at the multiple open events held at the IOP every week, and we are proud to have brought the following class of Fellows to Harvard this semester:
Resident Fellows: Yohannes Abraham, Dan Balz, Cong. Jason Chaffetz, Karen Finney, Sec. Sally Jewell, and Mark Strand
Visiting Fellows: Guy Benson, Gov. Steven Beshear, Cornell Brooks, Mika Brzezinski, Mary Katharine Ham, Mayor Sylvester James (upcoming), Corey Lewandowski (here this week), Robby Mook, Joe Scarborough, Sean Spicer, and Joe Slade White
All of these individuals have hosted or will host a broad variety of events that provide Harvard students with the unique opportunity for direct discussion with themselves and other prominent political figures. This engagement is the heart of the Fellows and Study Groups Program.
Jason Ge ’18 is an Applied Math concentrator in Leverett House. Emily M. Hall ’18 is a Government concentrator in Adams House. They are the co-chairs of the Fellows and Study Groups Program at the Institute of Politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Administrative Board required six undergraduates to temporarily withdraw from the College for "social behavior" related to alcohol, drugs, or sexual activity in the 2016-2017 academic year, a slight increase from 2015-2016, according to caseload data released by the disciplinary body.
The Ad Board also placed 22 total students on probation in 2016–2017—13 of them for social behavior—according to the statistics, which the body releases on its website every year. The Ad Board, composed of Faculty and administrators and chaired by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, reviews undergraduates’ academic records and enforces standards of social conduct laid out in the Harvard College student handbook.
In 2016–2017, the Ad Board issued “House warnings” to eight students for social behavior related to alcohol, marking a five-year low and a sharp decrease from the 25 such warnings the body issued last year.
But the vast majority of the body’s work involves evaluating student requests for exceptions to academic rules—like petitions for leaves of absence or exam conflicts. In 2016–2017, the board approved 1,640 such petitions, the highest number in the last five years.
In total, the Ad Board approved 254 student requests for a leave of absence in 2016–2017, a slight decrease from the previous year, when 266 requested and received leaves. Over the past five years, the number of students petitioning for a leave of absence has held roughly steady at around 230.
The statistics on leave of absence do not include students studying in other countries or taking leaves mandated by administrators.
Notably, 204 students petitioned the Ad Board for permission to study abroad during the 2016–2017 academic year, representing another five-year high.
Camila L. Nardozzi, director of the Office of International Education, said the number of students who actually chose to study internationally is much lower. She said that, while interest in study abroad has increased in recent years, many students rescind their applications after they submit petitions.
“What you see in the Ad Board is not indicative of the students who actually study abroad because we have a lot of attrition,” Nardozzi said. “The interest in study abroad has increased pretty drastically; students are at least considering it as a very real option.”
Nardozzi said she thinks there is no clear explanation for the uptick in student interest in other countries.
Ad Board Secretary Lauren E. Brandt did not respond to a request for comment.
The Ad Board used to serve as the College’s primary disciplinary body, hearing cheating cases in addition to its other responsibilities. But in 2015, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences established a new student-faculty judicial group—the Honor Council—to adjudicate academic dishonesty at Harvard.
The Council released its own report in October 2017 revealing that “inappropriate collaboration” cases doubled between 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. The spike in cheating comes the same year that a cheating scandal in Harvard’s flagship introductory computer science course swept campus: More than 10 percent of students who took Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” in fall 2016 appeared before the Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four referenda will appear on the Undergraduate Council’s presidential election ballot when voting begins next week, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19.
The referenda include questions about extending Thanksgiving break, bringing back "Harvard Time," funding class-wide programming for upperclassmen, and designating physical space towards a multicultural center. In accordance with the UC’s rules, all four questions obtained more than the 650 signatures required to appear on the ballot.
The Thanksgiving break question—which asks students whether the College should extend Thanksgiving break to include the Monday and Tuesday before the holiday—garnered the most signatures with 947, while the multicultural center question made it on with 680 signatures. The "Harvard Time" question, which asks students if the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should preserve the seven-minute grace period between classes—scheduled to be eliminated in fall 2018—received 685 signatures.
The Council recently agreed to strike a rule that previously allowed the body to overturn referenda. If a majority of voters vote in favor of a ballot question, it will now become binding.
A referendum sponsored by comedy groups On Harvard Time and Satire V seeking to make mumps the official disease of Harvard did not get enough signatures to appear on next week’s ballot.
Quincy House representative Wyatt M. Robertson ’18, who proposed the ballot question asking if the College should create more class-wide programming for sophomores and juniors, said he hasn’t decided whether or not he will go door-to-door in order to gain support. Robertson’s question garnered 739 student signatures.
“We’re going to definitely go out on all the e-mail lists,” he said. “I haven’t decided whether or not I’m going to canvas for it.”
He added that he spent a lot of time with students talking about the referendum when he was trying to garner enough signatures for it to appear on the ballot.
“When I was collecting signatures, I did a lot of canvassing. So there was a lot of talking to people in person about what the actual referendum means,” he said.
Voting on the referenda and candidates vying for the UC’s presidency and vice presidency will begin on Monday, Nov. 13 at noon and close on Thursday, Nov. 16 at noon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Computer Science professor Barbara J. Grosz opened enrollment for Computer Science 108: “Intelligent Systems: Design and Ethical Challenge” for its second year in fall 2016, she received 140 applications for 30 spots. This fall, she again received over 130 applications for her course, which is co-taught with Philosophy professor Jeff Behrends.
According to Grosz, CS 108 is one of six computer science courses this fall that are co-taught by either professors or teaching fellows from the Philosophy department. She said this initiative, which has been growing over the past few years, seeks to to embed ethics into regularly offered Computer Science courses.
The Computer Science department is also preparing to include a Philosophy component into CS 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” next spring, which boasted the fourth largest undergraduate enrollment in spring 2017.
“After the first year I taught [CS 108], students suggested that we should have more classes like that,” Grosz said. “Because of the huge demand, I realized that we couldn’t create a bunch of specialized courses. Instead, we should integrate ethics into every, or almost every, CS course we teach.”
Philosophy professor Alison Simmons said that along with Grosz, she started recruiting graduate students from the Philosophy department to teach in Computer Science courses.
“Barbara [Grosz] called one day and said ‘Alison, we really need to talk. We should be working together,’” Simmons said. “We need to help students identify and think through the ethical implications of what they are doing in Computer Science.”
Grosz said that Harvard is among the first universities to integrate Philosophy across different Computer Science courses. Instead of offering specialized computer ethics electives, the collaboration with the Philosophy department allowed the project to scale up in size quickly, according to Grosz.
“It’s a win-win situation because it is really a wonderful experience for the Philosophy students,” Grosz said. “It gives them an experience teaching and learning about technology that most Philosophy students in most universities would not find.”
Philosophy graduate student Ronni G. Sadovsky co-taught CS 108 with Grosz last year and said that she especially enjoyed facilitating “first philosophical encounters” for students who have never studied Philosophy.
“Even though we can’t solve the problem, there is a lot more richness we can get out of a detailed, thoughtful analysis of philosophical problems” Sadovsky said. “All the students—regardless of their background in Biology, Math, Computer Science, or even in the humanities—virtually everyone was having an ‘Eureka’ moment.”
Kate Vredenburgh, a Philosophy graduate student who is a teaching fellow in three Computer Science courses this fall, said that she hoped to see the integration of more ethics into research in other disciplines.
“Often I think there is a tendency, when you are working with ethics, to be disconnected with practitioners,” she said. “Being in contact with the material made me aware of some of the current issues that were not on my radar.”
According to Grosz, the Computer Science classes taught this semester that include an ethics component are CS 136: “Economics and Computation,” CS 165: “Data Systems,” CS 182 “Artificial Intelligence,” CS 126: “Fairness, Privacy, and Validity in Data Analysis,” and CS 134: “Networks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With this Thursday's concentration declaration looming, faculty and academic advisers in a variety of fields hosted office hours and open houses to inform sophomores about their areas of study.
Margo S. Levine, Associate Director of Applied Mathematics, and several administrators in other departments said concentrations are not looking to attract more students, but rather to help students find their desired paths of study.
“As far as we’re concerned, as long as the students can find a concentration that supports them in achieving their intellectual goals, then it’s fine if that’s called Applied Math, but it’s also fine if it’s called Computer Science or Math or Statistics,” she said.
Levine said that the Applied Math advisers participated in a concentration fair with other departments from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences on Monday, and had their own event with the undergraduate Applied Math Society afterwards.
Jennifer L. Brady, Associate Director of Studies in History and Literature, also said the purpose of the Hist and Lit event on Nov. 1 was to advise students rather than persuade them to declare the concentration.
“Over the past 50 years, the average number of Hist and Lit concentrators per year has been in the high fifties. We expect this year’s class to be no exception to that,” she said. “It’s not concentrator numbers, it’s the kind of advising that we think is important to help sophomores—whether they choose Hist and Lit or not, to choose the best concentration for them.”
Undergraduate Coordinator of the Music Department Mary MacKinnon said that her department, as well as many other Humanities departments, typically enroll many joint concentrators.
“We have a lot of CS, English, different languages, and we have some in Chemistry as well, some even in Biology. A good number in Math—pretty constant—and other humanities department too,” she said.
MacKinnon said the Music department receives funding from the Arts and Humanities divisional dean to publicize the concentration—this year, their budget was $5,000. She added that the department has hosted events throughout the semester, such as talks with professors, but it has spent more time targeting sophomores in the weeks leading up to the declaration deadline.
“Now it’s time that we email them every week; trying to host events, trying to talk to them, without being annoying,” she said.
Folklore and Mythology Chair Stephen A. Mitchell said he tells prospective concentrators about the variety of topics they can focus on in their theses. A thesis or senior project is required in the department.
“We’ve had people who have written on topics as diverse as the differing attitudes of Native New Zealanders versus eco-warriors about what to do about the dead whale on the beach, or about the Cambodian genocide who had family members who were involved,” he said.
All sophomores must complete their department’s requirements for concentration declaration by Thursday.

Stephen Wolfram—founder of Wolfram Alpha and CEO of Wolfram Research—discussed computational thinking in the 21st century with Graduate School of Education professor Howard Gardner at an Askwith Forum event on Monday.
Wolfram defined computational thinking as “the activity for a human of taking something that they want to know about or that they want to have happen in the world, and formulating it in such a way that a sufficiently smart computer can then know what to do.”
The process of computational thinking can be applied to any field, according to Wolfram. “Computational thinking is a bigger, more significant thing that I think will be remembered as probably the most important intellectual achievement of the 21st century,” he said.
Wolfram dispelled what he described as a misconception of equating coding with computational thinking. “Coding tends to mean the low-level construction of programs, sort of step-by-step, which is something more akin to knowing how to fix your car in detail than sort of knowing how to drive the car,” Wolfram said. “We're not so much interested in driving the car, we're more interested in going inside the engine and looking at the details of how to put together the pistons and so on.”
Coding, Wolfram argued, is “the enemy” of computational thinking. “I think with the low-level coding, it is as mechanical as a lot of the kind of math that kids find boring,” he said.
Gardner said he invited Wolfram because he wanted to learn more about Wolfram’s work and share the conversation with the public.
“I have known Stephen peripherally for a long time, but I don't really know what he does, and I figured this would be a good way to find out in more detail,” Gardner said.
This event, part of the Askwith Forum public lecture series, attracted approximately 200 Harvard affiliates and nearby residents. The next event will be held on Nov. 14 at the Graduate School of Education.
“They are also a way to open our doors to the greater Harvard community and general public,” Gardner said of the Askwith Forums.
Gardner said these forms are meant to contribute to “the intellectual life of the school through conversation, debate, and exchange of ideas.”
Alaisha K. Sharma ’20, an avid user of Wolfram Alpha, said she attended the lecture to learn about Wolfram’s thoughts on education. “I thought that was an interesting intersection,” she said, referring to the nexus of computing and education.

UPDATED: November 7, 2017 at 10:32 p.m.
Kevin Wong Wong Keet was getting frustrated. After watching his monthly rent rise for years, he had decided to look for a home in Allston-Brighton—but four times in a row, he had been outbid.
“Every single time, it was the same story. I’d come close, but someone always came in with a bid—all cash—well above what I was offering,” he said.
Wong Wong Keet’s struggles with what he called a “super aggressive” market is not unusual among prospective homebuyers in Allston-Brighton, a largely residential neighborhood that has in recent years seen an influx of interest from cash-paying investors. These developers often divide houses into individual units for rent, supporting what some residents say is a transient population of renters who can’t afford to put down roots in the area.
“We feel that it’s hard to invest in a neighborhood when you’re only renting because you’re losing money every month and not building equity,” said Galen M. Mook, a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force.
Seeking to stem the tide of investors, Harvard set aside $3 million of its community benefits package to support the All Bright Homeownership Program, an initiative to buy up homes in the area and resell them to homeowners with an owner-occupancy deed restriction, meaning that the buyer must live on the property. The program, implemented with the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation and the City of Boston in 2015, has so far sold 13 housing units to homeowners.
Wong Wong Keet was one of them. In June of 2017—a year and a half into his search—he came across a new listing in the North Allston area with an owner-occupancy agreement. “It made me think that I would have a better chance of getting it,” he said. Within a week, Wong Wong Keet’s offer on the Litchfield Street home was approved.
Jane McHale, another member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said that when she heard that her neighbor received an $800,000 cash offer for his home from an investor, she referred him to the All Bright Home Ownership Program. The program outbid the cash offer and resold the housing unit to “two great neighbors” who plan to stay in the neighborhood long-term, she said.
Roman Lilligren, who moved in next door to the McHales, said he would not have otherwise been able to acquire his current home.
“We lucked out in terms of our timing and what we found. I feel fortunate for that compared to what other people have gone through,” he said.
Still, while Lilligren and Wong Wong Keet represent the program’s success stories, Mook said the program needs to expand to be more effective. He said he has been searching to buy a home for the past four years, but that that prospective Allston homebuyers “don’t really have a chance to compete in a marketplace of investors.”
Additionally, according to Jane McHale’s husband Tim McHale, investors are still often able to outbid the All Bright Homeownership Program.
“They can’t justify going that high,” Tim McHale said. “I don't know how to motivate sellers to do the right thing when they can put an extra $100,000 in their pockets.”
Harvard funded the program as part of its $43 million community benefits package, which it offered to Allston as part of its Institutional Master Plan to significantly expand into the neighborhood. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is scheduled to move across the Charles in 2020.

UPDATED: November 7, 2017 at 1:31 p.m.
In front of a crowd of nearly 1,000 cheering Harvard affiliates, Elton John was named 2017 Harvard Humanitarian of the Year Monday afternoon in recognition of his work in support of HIV/AIDS research and awareness.
In a speech accepting the award, the English singer, songwriter, and entertainer urged members of the crowd to advance world peace by recognizing the humanity in one another.
“This has been the most important lesson of my life; nothing is more profound or more powerful than recognizing our common humanity,” John said, calling it the “most powerful force on earth.”
The award—presented annually by the Harvard University Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations—highlighted John’s work through the Elton John AIDS Foundation, an organization which has raised more than $385 million for HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, and research since its inception in 1992.
Formally known as the Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award, the award’s past honorees include Rihanna, Malala Yousafzai, Ban Ki-Moon, and Lionel Richie.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, after a characteristic introduction reflecting upon the College’s mission, praised John, saying, “Sir Elton John is a living embodiment of that Harvard College mission statement. He has used his gifts and talents to serve the world.”
After a standing ovation, John said he wished to dedicate the award to people working at the front lines of tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, calling them “the bravest and most compassionate people I have ever met.” Throughout his speech,  John shared pieces of wisdom from his life and career.
“I was so lucky early in life when I discovered a love of music,” he said, explaining how he clung to music for solace during times his parents didn’t get along.  John said exposure to artists such as Little Richard and Fats Domino shifted his path away from classical piano performance and toward becoming one of the most decorated rock and roll artists of all time.
“I had very small hands, and I’d never been a great concert pianist, neither did I want to be a great concert pianist. I wanted to beat the shit out of the piano,” he said to rousing applause.
The Humanitarian Award is hardly John’s first decoration. He has been awarded the Grammy, Tony, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards, and is a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee. His “Candle in the Wind 1997” is the best-selling single since music charts began.
But in Monday’s speech, John did not shy away from discussing less illustrious moments of his life.
At the peak of his career, “happiness became elusive, and darkness crept in,” John said, referencing his past struggles with drugs, alcohol addiction, and an eating disorder. “It was through humanitarian pursuits that my life took on vastly new meaning,” he said.
It was at this time that John worked to support the family of Ryan White, a high school student barred from his school in the 1980s upon being diagnosed with AIDS. John said working with White’s family was the catalyst for both his sobriety and the creation of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.
“I wanted to help them, but they ended up helping me far more,” John said. “Seeing how they dealt with adversity through getting to know them inspired me to turn my own life around.”
Krasimira Petkov, who attended the event, was thrilled to see John be given the award.
“I honestly think he’s one of the greatest picks; I mean, he has a lifetime of achievements that are honored here, so that’s wonderful,” she said.
In their speeches, both John and Khurana paid tribute to the late Dr. S. Allen Counter, founding director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, who passed away in July.
Kacey Gill ’20, an intern at the Harvard Foundation, said Counter’s legacy lives on through this year’s presentation, given that he chose John as this year’s recipient shortly before his death.
“I think it’s really important Dr. Counter chose this humanitarian before he passed, and I think it’s just amazing to see his vision brought into fruition,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge gears up for today's slate of elections, Harvard’s student unionization group is distributing a guide for voters.
Union organizers asked candidates for Cambridge City Council and Somerville Alderman to answer questions on issues ranging from  from “Affordable Housing” to “Sustainable Environmental Practices.”
Andrew B. Donnelly, a union organizer and graduate student, said Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers decided to create the guide to inform voters about relevant issues.
“This is the basic civic function of a union. This is what unions do,” he said. “They help workers engage with local politics and national politics and they help people become informed.”
The issue of unionization figures prominently in the booklet. In the first section of the book, entitled “Union Rights,” the candidates responded to union-related questions. HGSU-UAW asked Cambridge City Council candidates two questions: “Do you support teaching and research assistants’ right to organize our union?” and “Should Harvard drop its NLRB Appeal?”
Eighteen candidates answered “Yes” to both questions. The questionnaire did not include responses from the remaining eight candidates.
The voter guide comes as the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C. considers an appeal that could decide the fate of Harvard’s student unionization effort. Depending on how the five-person board of presidential appointees rules, Harvard may have to hold a revote of a November 2016 student unionization election.
Donnelly praised the candidates for their stance on Harvard’s appeal.
“We very much appreciate their support and we're happy that so many of them are telling Harvard to drop this anti-democratic appeal,” he said.
In an email sent to students, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 argued that the original election was legitimate. In particular, he said that the list of voters for the election was adequate—one of the primary questions in the NLRB case.
“The University’s goal was always to include all eligible voters on the list,” he wrote. “A University team worked diligently to create the most accurate list possible despite challenging conditions: a University-wide bargaining unit; a tight deadline set by the HGSU-UAW and the NLRB; and information systems that were not designed for this purpose.”
Donnelly said the union asked Harvard undergrads and grad students for input into the questions HGSU-UAW posed to the candidates.
“We solicited the things that matter from our members, from grad students and undergrads, and we tried to streamline that into a few questions that City Council candidates could answer,” he said.
The union’s guide comes shortly before Cambridge residents will go to the polls to cast their ballots in a variety of local elections, including the City Council race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Two weeks ago, Harvard football lay in ruins.
Princeton had just demolished the Crimson, 52-17. That result exposed holes in the defense and hung Harvard with two league losses. The Crimson left injured and demoralized.
Then began an unlikely transformation. In the past two weeks, Harvard has revived a moribund season. In week six, the Crimson stormed back to top Dartmouth, 25-22. And last Saturday, in week seven, Harvard ripped off 21 straight points to unseat Columbia (6-2, 3-2 Ivy).
After that 21-14 victory, Harvard (5-3, 3-2) controls its destiny once more. If the Crimson closes with wins over Penn and Yale, then the program will share the Ivy League championship.
GET RICHIE QUICK
In his first two seasons, junior defensive tackle Richie Ryan played in 19 games and recorded 1.5 sacks. Last Saturday, in 60 dominant minutes against Columbia, he tallied 2.5.
On a day when freshman quarterback Jake Smith threw four interceptions in the first 20 minutes, the Harvard defense salvaged the game, holding the Lions scoreless in the second and third quarters. And in the final minutes, Crimson tacklers clinched the win by halting Columbia’s final drive.
The defensive line deserved special credit. Lions quarterback Anders Hill faced pressure all afternoon and took eight sacks. Before Saturday, Hill ranked as the Ancient Eight’s second-most prolific passer with 1,838 yards. He never got in his rhythm against the Crimson and finished with 184 yards and two interceptions.
Ryan led the pass rush. The 275-pound veteran forced a strip-sack late in the third quarter. He pummeled Hill on second-and-10, and teammate Kelvin Apari recovered at the Columbia 39.
Besides his sacks, Ryan added another tackle for a loss and stuffed the lone designed run on the Lions’ final drive. For his efforts, the junior was named Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week.
Ryan’s production proved especially crucial given depth issues on the defense. Junior defensive lineman DJ Bailey sat out the game, and Apari sustained a lower-body injury in the second half.
“I think we have some of the best athletes in the league,” said senior defensive lineman Stone Hart. “This is a year where anyone can beat anyone, so it’s just about doing your job, staying focused, and not giving up.”
VIVIANO REVIVED
It took Jake Smith weeks to win the starting quarterback job. On Saturday, it took him less than 20 minutes to jeopardize it.
All season, the freshman has played like a veteran, zipping passes to open receivers, managing the pass rush, and throwing the ball away when necessary. Against Columbia, though, he reverted to rookie mistakes, tossing three interceptions in the first quarter and a fourth early in the second.
At that point, Harvard coach Tim Murphy yanked Smith in favor of fifth-year senior Joe Viviano. The veteran proceeded to notch two touchdowns before halftime—although one came on a short field after Hill threw a pick.
Viviano finished out the rest of the game, going 6-of-12 for 120 yards and two scores. Smith, by contrast, went 6-of-11 for 70 yards.
Smith’s nightmarish performance introduces some quarterback controversy this week. The fact that Murphy stuck with the freshman after three interceptions indicates great faith. Besides Saturday, Smith has rewarded the confidence. Meanwhile, if Murphy starts Viviano, he can take solace in the fact that the veteran already has started 11 games.
“They have the nice luxury of being able to go back to a more experienced kid,” Columbia coach Al Bagnoli said. “[Smith] will learn from that…. It’s just a blip on the radar for him.”
FLAGGING CRIMSON
On Saturday, Harvard totaled 110 penalty yards, more than in any other contest this season. Seven whistles came in a torturous fourth quarter in which Columbia nearly erased a 14-point gap.
Down 21-7, the visitors opened the period with an 88-yard drive that finished in the end zone. A facemask tackle gave the Lions 15 yards, and unsportsmanlike conduct by the Crimson sidelines added 15 more. The most injurious penalty, however, was defensive holding that converted a third-and-11 at the Columbia 40.
“I’d be a liar if I said there wasn’t a feeling that the momentum had shifted,” Murphy said. “All you can do when that happens is just dig down and fight.”
Harvard has struggled all season with penalty yardage. The team leads the league with 63 flags, meaning nearly eight a game. In the last minute, when the Lions advanced into the red zone, it was fitting that defensive pass interference gave the hosts a first-and-goal from the eight.
While the Crimson escaped with the win, penalties loom as a point of weakness. In Saturday’s fourth quarter, 45 percent of Columbia’s offensive yardage came thanks to flags.
“We have so many things we still have to improve upon,” Murphy said. “It’s just one day at a time.”

In a series that began on Sunday and will continue through the Crimson’s season opener on Nov. 10 against MIT, men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason will look at Harvard’s 13 nonconference opponents. Coming in at No. 6 is George Washington.
No. 13: MIT
No. 12: Holy Cross
No. 11: Fordham
No. 10: Manhattan
No. 9: Massachusetts
No. 8: Wofford
No. 7: Northeastern
George Washington
2017-2018 Matchup: Saturday, December 23 at Charles E. Smith Athletic Center, Washington, D.C. (1:00 p.m.)
2016-2017 Record: 20-15 overall, 10-8 Atlantic Ten
2016-2017 Matchup: George Washington, 77, Harvard, 74
Head Coach: Maurice Joseph (2nd season)
Key Returning Players: senior guard Yuta Watanabe (averaged 35.1 minutes a season ago and brings size to the GW backcourt, put up 12.2 points per game); graduate forward Patrick Steeves (transfer from Harvard shot 48.2 percent from the field and started 10 games)
Stat to Watch: 6: the Colonials won six of their final seven games, including a victory over regular season conference champion Dayton
Overview: GW was picked to finish 11th in the 14-team Atlantic Ten. Maurice Joseph returns Watanabe and Steeves as wings but the rest of his bunch lacks experience. The Colonials will look to ride the momentum that they generated toward the end of last season to make their first NCAA Tournament since 2014.

Anywhere from a fifth to a quarter of Harvard students graduate virgins depending on the year, but we still get really excited about sex. Talking about it, researching it, writing theses on it. But if we’re being honest, some of us leave many things to be desired when we actually, you know, do it. Raise your hand if you’ve had at least one of your partners at Harvard look at you begrudgingly after a raunchy night.
Lucky for you, Harvard’s seventh Annual Sex Week starts today. Featuring 12 events, Sex Week is dedicated to educating you and encouraging more open conversations on sex, relationships, sexual health, sexuality, gender and gender identity, and more. You know how you came to Harvard lacking social skills to a (very high) degree since you spent all of high school busily not having fun? Now is your chance to teach and unclothe the beast within.
Frisky Fun for Everyone
Sex Week prides itself on inclusivity and tackling a variety of topics in a steamy fashion. For all you overwhelmed STEM people, especially you poor (and soon-to-be-rich) engineers, there is an entire event dedicated to you called “Hacking Your Sex Life: What Happens When Engineers Get Frisky.” Events like “What What in the Butt: Anal 101” and “Unleashed: Kink 101” tackle taboo topics in an approachable way with the hopes of widening conversations around sex.
In addition to these playful events, Sex Week recognizes and brings light to intersectional issues of sex. Has anyone ever had the audacity to call you exotic or something along those lines because of your race or ethnicity? If so, be sure to check out the Exotification, Sex, and Race session, where a panel of students talk about their experiences.
Vibrators, Dildos, and Condoms. Oh My!
There’s a record number of freebies slated to appear throughout the week. So if you’ve been eyeing an expensive toy in everyone’s favorite Square sex shop, Good Vibrations, never fear! And, if you just haven’t been getting the human attention you need down there, again, never fear! You can pleasure yourself and save yourself the embarrassment of the receipt showing up on your bank account by perhaps snagging a toy from one of these events.
And of course, condoms will be in abundance. Female and male, colored and ribbed, flavored and scented. Grab one, grab all.
“We have the most amazing corporate partners,” Lita Pena ’19, the co-president of Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard (SHEATH) said. “We got thousands of toys. We have vibrators, dildos, things for both anatomies, things for multiple people, and really anything you can imagine, we’ve got.”
A Bit About the Sexy Sponsors
Founded in 2011, SHEATH is designed to promote a safe, inclusive space for Harvard students to get educated and talk about sex, especially since we don’t have enough time to do it much (if at all).
While discussing sex can be an uncomfortable prospect, Pena emphasized that “there’s really no reason for it to be stigmatized.” The wide range of scheduled activities, which will hopefully overlap with your and your friends’ limited free time, aim to give people “new hopes, and new understandings” in their sexual lives.
Food in the Bedroom 
If you can’t persuade a friend to go for the insane freebies bestowed upon us this week, just remind them that there will also be an abundance of things to put in your mouth. We’re talkin hella free food (get your head out of the gutter!), including cupcakes that look like vaginas (okay, head back in the gutter…).
Slide into these events, and get your education on! Thank us later.

Whether you’re single and just can’t seem to get cuffed, or in a long term relationship looking to try something new, one truth is undeniable: We all could use a sex toy. That’s why it was no surprise that Sever 113 was filled with fresh faces for Sex Toys 101. Some people walked out with a new sex toy to try out, while others walked out having had their whole world changed. Here’re just some of the things we heard throughout the process.
“Female condom? That doesn’t sound helpful.”
We really hope this person attends more Sex Week events to develop their sexual literacy.
“Candy!” “Girl that’s not candy.”
Yes we advertised this on our Free Food Watch, but with a name like Sex Toys 101, we’re not sure what you expected exactly.
When passed a vibrator: “Oh it vibrates.”
We’re glad whoever this was showed up to the presentation, because it must’ve been a game changer for him/her.
“You can cuddle with a sex toy if you try hard enough.”
Not entirely sure about this, but this could be a revolution for the single folks among us.
On a fleshlight: “I bet I could pass this off as a flashlight.”
Fleshlight. Flashlight. Know the difference, it could save your dignity one day.
“Why didn’t you come here with your boyfriend?”
We think Sex Toys 101 sounds like a pretty ideal date spot. Then again, maybe this person wanted to surprise their significant other later on. We’ll assume best intentions.
“How would I get this out of my anus if it just went in and got stuck?”
Good question, and let’s hope no one has to find out: Being in the emergency room with a sex toy stuck in your butt is one thing your self-respect will never recover from.
“Didn’t win in bed, didn’t win in this raffle either.”
Well we can’t win everything, and sometimes we win nothing. Better luck next time.
Be sure to check out upcoming Sex Week events to do your own “overheard” and pick up a few freebies along the way.
