After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taylor Swift album releases regularly cause frenzies: Image after image of the album cover appears on many an Instagram story, accompanied by a crying emoji and caption about how her new work is relatable or emotional. People with accounts on genius.com set to work decoding (abundant and childish) Easter eggs in the lyrics, providing a blueprint to plebeians who only manage to listen to the new release at 10 a.m. after having had their first cup of coffee. (Necessary, for an optimal listening experience.) And, on the morning of August 23, after the midnight release of “Lover” but before the universal 9-5 work day, Buzzfeed published an article at 8:38 a.m., unpacking how Swift feels about Calvin Harris on the first track, titled “I Forgot That You Existed.” Clearly, her memory lapse has disappeared, because she does not hold back.
At this point, the frenzy will happen even if the quality of Swift’s music took a sudden noise-dive, but mania at this scale, for this album, is largely unwarranted. The individual moments that are worth hearing, lasting a few lines in a smattering of songs, do not have the power, unfortunately, to life up the entire album. This becomes more noticeable as the album progresses and the songs start to blend into each other almost indistinguishably.
It’s unfortunately telling that many of the 18 songs on Swift’s newest album are immediately forgettable. “I Forgot That You Existed” glides smoothly into “Cruel Summer” in a way that is pleasant at first, then bland. Their tempo is similar enough to make the transition effective and logical, but both songs lack the spark that could make them memorable. “Cruel Summer” contains the line “‘I love you,’ ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?” which accurately sums up fraught tentativeness of dating in 2019, but it’s otherwise buried deep in the song itself.
Stand-outs include “The Man,” in which she — like many women no doubt have done once in their lives — imagines what life would be like if she were a man who acted in the exact same way as her female self does (spoiler: she would face less backlash in the media); “I Think He Knows,” a bop whose energy intensifies to the point of catchiness on the line “skipping down 16th avenue”; “Cornelia Street”, which anchors love to a place in a way that feels remarkably relatable and familiar; and “London Boy,” a song that is a parody of itself and is thus successful at providing absurd entertainment.
One honorable mention is “Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince,” if not only for the title. Swift sounds a tad more mature on this track, having realized that when “you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes,” but the self-reflection does not go deep enough, and makes for a frustratingly unsatisfying listen thanks to its tepid vagueness. There’s a lingering sense on this track, and on the vast majority of the others on the album, that there has to be something more — that Swift hasn’t quite tugged at all the heartstrings like she has in the past, in songs like “Red” or “Holy Ground.”
The most glaring aspect of the album is its lingering blandness: It’s very easy for the mind to wander halfway through one track, only to wind up at the end of the album wondering whether all that time really passed. (Weren’t we just on the second song?) Perhaps this is intentional, however. Swift certainly loves dropping Easter eggs almost as much as her fans love parsing her words, magazine interviews, and awkward dance moves on stage — and maybe, three years into a closely-guarded relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, things are boring because there’s simply less fodder to write about. Not that reflections on their relationship don’t appear on “Lover”: the title track, “Paper Rings,” “Cornelia Street,” and “London Boy” all seemingly refer to him. Yet even these four songs might be condensed or considered interchangeable.
Lyrically, the album falls flat. Short verses, even shorter bridges, and breathy choruses keep each song running close to three minutes most of the time, but the substance simply isn’t there. Amid this summer’s earlier controversy surrounding “You Need to Calm Down” — Taylor, dealing with haters is not the same thing as dealing with rabid homophobia — the poor quality of her metaphors and lyrics went unnoticed. It’s a little harder to mask these issues when they appear on much of the 18-song tracklist. It would also be nice if “throwing shade,” which appears at least twice on this album, was excised from the lyrics on any forthcoming albums.
At some point, Swift decided that talk-singing would be an interesting path to explore: admirable, certainly, since artists don’t have to be loyal to past work simply to appease current fans’ nostalgia. But it appears on multiple tracks, including “I Forgot That You Existed,” and it does not do her music any justice, and quickly becomes childish. Indeed, much of the album sounds as though Swift were far younger, and though there’s no specific way an artist should sound at the age of 30, the listener is left wondering when, if ever, Swift’s work will mature into something more complex and nuanced than this latest release. One way to do that? Get rid of the Easter eggs. Let the musical quality (or lack thereof) speak for itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ariana M. Kam ’16 first met Samantha Lin ’16 when Lin was walking the Leverett House greyhound. Upon learning that Kam loved greyhounds, Lin didn’t hesitate: She arranged to have Kam look after the greyhound for the rest of the school year.
“I think only Sam could have understood how much happiness that dog brought me, and I will always be grateful to her for that simple act of kindness,” wrote Kam, who came to know Lin through their shared concentration in Organismic Evolutionary Biology.
Lin, a veterinary student and former Crimson Sports Comp Director, was killed Aug. 5, when two cars hit her as she was crossing the street in Napa, Calif. She was 25 years old.
Lin’s friends and professors remember her as a lover of all living creatures who approached everything she did with unyielding dedication.
“Sam was just someone who always gave everything like 100, 110 percent, whether it was The Crimson or the coursework or her friends,” said Brenna R. Nelsen ’15, who befriended Lin when they were both seeking to join The Crimson. “She was always so motivated and driven and truthfully inspiring.”
A rising fourth-year student at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Lin was close to achieving her goal of being a small animal surgeon, which had been her dream since she was four years old. During her time at NC State, she won a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine endowment grant and the school’s Dr. James Edgar Smallwood Scholarship for Student Excellence.
“She was absolutely loving life, because she was kind of living out her childhood dream of actually becoming a veterinarian,” Nelsen said. “One of the saddest things is to realize is that Sam is never going to live out her dream of being a small animal surgeon.”
While at Harvard, Lin surrounded herself with animals and animal enthusiasts. In addition to befriending the Leverett House greyhound, she researched canine genomics at the Broad Institute and incorporated her research in her senior thesis. Beginning in her sophomore year, Lin began volunteering with the cardiology team of the Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston.
Lin also spent considerable time with the Harvard Pre-Vet Society, serving on its executive board. She created a “genuinely supportive community” for those aiming to attend veterinary school, according to Andrew J. Berry, Lin’s academic advisor. She provided information about the veterinary application process and designed shirts for the society’s members, emblazoned with the slogan “Real doctors treat more than one species.”
While juggling pre-veterinary requirements and extracurriculars, Lin made time to watch and follow football, another one of her enduring passions. After matriculating to Harvard, Lin decided to keep football a part of her life as a sports writer for The Crimson.
“When I ended up at Harvard, where CS50 office hours are better attended than football games, I realized I had two options if I wanted to religiously attend games without fielding too many questions on why I was there—the first was joining the cheer team; the second, writing football for the Crimson Sports Board,” Lin wrote in her parting Crimson article.
After reporting on women’s crew and basketball competitions, Lin attained her desired position as football beat writer, a role that entailed traveling up and down the East Coast and sitting outside in freezing cold weather. She bore it all with optimism, according to fellow Crimson sports editor David S.W. Steinbach ’16. The two covered football together for three years, during which they shared each other’s company for many a long drive.
“You learn a lot about someone when you take a four or five hour drive with them, and often you will grow sort of tired of your travel companions,” Steinbach said. “And I was never once tired or bored while talking with Sam on those long rides, not one bit really. She just truly had an engaging personality and was relentlessly optimistic.”
The pair went on to direct the Sports Board comp, training and initiating hopeful sportswriters. The prospect of continuing to work with Lin — who often stayed late to help him transcribe quotes even after she had filed her own story — drove Steinbach to sign on as a comp director.
“I think that the compers that we interacted with just looked up to Sam immensely just because of the sort of magnetic and engaging and selfless personality that she had,” Steinbach said.
That magnetic personality is what her friends and mentors say they will miss the most.
“When Sam walked into a room, people spontaneously gravitated to her, and things — good things, fun things, exciting things — would happen,” Berry wrote in an email. “Sam had so much to give the world.”
