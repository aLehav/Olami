Jude Russo
Choice Quote: “Theater did not happen.”
Are you an unholy combination of Herodotus, combs, and the first half of the “Twilight” series? Congrats! You’re Jude. You float like a butterfly and sting like a bee. Sometimes you drink gasoline to impress your TF, to no avail. Readers love you, compers fear you, and your TF remains ambivalent toward you.
Abby Noyes
Choice Quote: “I want to go to there.”
You’re Abby if you make a mean corn bake. You’re a southern belle as sweet as Tupelo honey with an affinity for pugs. You’re not afraid to stick it to the man. You don’t need no man. You co-wrote Christina Aguilera’s “Ain’t No Other Man.” You are not a man. Man, you feel like a woman. Did we mention corn bake? You love corn bake.
Grace Huckins
Choice Quote: “Give. Me. BRAIIIIIIINS.”
You’re Grace if you enjoy studying the subtle complexities of the mind, baking snickerdoodle cookies, and devouring the souls of your enemies. For research purposes. You are Jay Z’s muse and Beyoncé’s mortal enemy. Did you know you’re the princess of Genovia? WELL, YOU ARE. Soak it in.
David Kurlander
Choice Quote: “You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.”
Do you have a passion for fashion? A soft spot for romantic comedies starring a young Julia Roberts? A criminal record in no fewer than eight African countries? You’re totally a David. You were the inspiration for the last two Adele albums. You were born in 1994, but you peaked in 1973.


Victoria Lin
Choice Quote: “Refrigerator? I hardly know her!”
By day, you nurse puppies back to health at the local animal shelter. By night, you’re a crime-solving, butt-kicking detective with her own reality show on the E! network. One time Michael Cera called you pretty at a party, so you punched him squarely in the face.
Wayne Gretzky
Choice Quote: “Wait, where am I?”
You didn’t know Wayne Gretzky writes for the Arts board? That’s okay, because neither does he. But he’ll learn. You’re Wayne if you’re really good at hockey, everyone on the Arts board loves you, you have very poor security around your home, and you currently don’t know where you are.
Ha Le
Choice Quote: “Honey got me swishing like a dreadlock. She don’t wrestle, but I got her in a headlock.”
First of all, Ha is Pitbull. No, not the dog. Like, the rapper. You’re Ha/Pitbull if you’re from Miami, are best friends with Beyoncé, and have parents who forced you to put your burgeoning rap career on hold to pursue a biomedical engineering degree at Harvard. It’s okay. You’ll make it through.

How long is Jude D. “Jude D.” Russo going to wear us out with these cheeky but vapid diatribes? At the beginning of his tenure at The Harvard Crimson, the slightly antiquated harrumphing was charming enough in an impudent sort of way, but the act’s gotten old, and his most recent vanity piece, “How to Write a Jude D. Russo Review,” is the worst kind of self-fondling garbage and hopefully will mark an end of a justly uncelebrated career.
Russo is pretty obviously aware that his posturing is a bit fraudulent. Oscar Wilde says the punishment for those who make masks for themselves is that they must wear them, and we have to take some modest pleasure from the fact that the mask Russo has made for himself is a pretty uncharming one and that he doesn’t seem to like it much either. His conclusion “You’re now a terrible, terrible person that nobody likes. Good job!” is pretty grim, as far as self-indictments go, but the possibility of any sort of redemptive irony is undercut by the fact that his self-awareness is completely untempered by any sort of indication of intention of self-reform. If this were a Jude D. Russo review, there’d be some sort of sententious human-nature observation here, but we trust the reader enough to let him draw his own fucking conclusions from the circumstances.
Because at the end of the day, that’s kind of the issue: not trusting the reader. It’s pretty clear that Russo’s problem is wanting to make sure that everyone thinks he’s smart, he’s tasteful, he’s authoritative, instead of just acknowledging that he’s making this shit up as he goes along, just like everyone else. People don’t care that you can cite Xenophanes or that you can rap all the Kanye verses from “Watch the Throne;” people care that you’re a human being, and that seems to be the department where Russo’s pretty lacking, behind the over-written prose and classical invocations and little strained nods to current pop-culture that are clearly meant to let his audience know that he knows about everything, not just old stuff or high-arty stuff. Russo wants you to think he knows everything.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter whether or not you know everything, which Russo obviously does not anyway. What does go a long way is having some humility and an occasional touch of personal sincerity (or at least a good facsimile thereof) and even the once-in-a-blue-moon ounce of human compassion, and these are all departments in which our boy is pretty lacking. “How to Write” underlines this circumstance with a big red marker. So, as he bids farewell to his job on the Crimson, let’s give him the send-off that even he knows he deserves—
“Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me lay on you a so-so entertainer, not much of a humanitarian, and this cat was never nobody's friend, in his final appearance on the great stage of life (you can applaud if you wanna)—”

In his 1960 pre-election book “The Strategy of Peace,” then-Senator John F. Kennedy writes, “The Middle East today is a monument to Western misunderstanding. During the last eight years the West has ignominiously presided over the liquidation of its power in the whole region, while the U.S.S.R. has gained important footholds. American policy has wavered and wobbled as much, if not more, than any other Western country.”
Kennedy was prescient in his belief that Western misjudgment and abdication in the Middle East carried enormous consequences not only for American policy, but also for the safety and security of the region and the world. Unfortunately, history indeed repeats itself. Today, we are reaping those consequences.
Syria is literally in flames. The Assad regime is still in power, propped up by proxies Iran and Russia, and millions of refugees flee to Europe on a scale not witnessed since World War II. Our $500 million program to train and equip the Syrian rebels was a disaster, and the credibility of American policy still stings as Assad continues to murder civilians after crossing this President’s arbitrary red line. As the world watches Syria burn, Russia has stepped in to gain these “important footholds” that JFK spoke of. Consequently, Putin is now the power broker, and given his geopolitical interests and tactical moves to rid of the Syrian rebels, the consequences of this can only be viewed as bad for U.S. foreign policy.
After the monumental mistake in 2011 to remove all American troops from Iraq, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, now controls large swaths of territory in both Iraq and Syria. As we now know, this group is the epitome of savagery, beheading innocent civilians while declaring their intention to create a radicalized caliphate. Their actions rightfully provoked international outrage, and so the West vowed to ultimately degrade and destroy this terrorist group. President Obama promised to lead an international coalition to destroy the Islamic State, and airstrikes reliably commenced.
But where are we now? Various radical Islamic terrorist proxies are still pervasive across North Africa and parts of the Middle East. As Harvard Professor Niall Ferguson points out, total fatalities due to armed conflict in the world have risen by a factor close to four since 2010, while total fatalities due to terrorism in the world have increased by a factor close to six. Western intelligence currently believes that Islamic State sympathizers in the Sinai bombed a Russian airliner this past October, killing over 200 people. France has become the Western target of choice for terrorism, including three separate terrorist incidents just this year: the tragic shootings at Charlie Hebdo, a gunman’s attempted attack on a French train, and now the massacre in Paris.
Ironically, on the same day President Obama remarked that the Islamic State had been “contained,” its affiliates went on a killing rampage in Paris, bombing a soccer stadium, occupying a concert venue, and randomly terrorizing multiple public places. In the worst attack on French soil since the days of Hitler, over 120 people brutally lost their lives. The consequences of Western inaction were painfully laid bare in the streets of Paris.
So where do we go from here? Above all else, a credible strategy that destroys ISIL must be clearly delineated. Obviously, the current lack of strategy has failed. We can no longer afford to deal fecklessly with the Islamic State. Similar to President Bush after September 11, or Reagan after the 1983 bombings in Beirut, our leaders must now send a clear message that these terrorists will be annihilated.
If the West continues to maintain its current passivity, the Islamic State’s perceived invincibility increases, which acts as a recruitment tool for potential jihadists. More consequential, however, is the widely accepted belief that the next target will be the United States.
When preparing his fellow countrymen for action, President Kennedy often cited Winston Churchill’s admonition: “We shall not escape our dangers by recoiling from them.” History should have taught us that this is a self-evident truth, neither passing nor mitigating through the annals of time. Withdrawal has always only tempted the enemy, and today is no different.
As the ramifications of Western inaction continue to manifest, it is imperative that we start to change sail. It is time for the West, and America in particular, to reclaim the mantle of leadership. Now is the time to act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent op-ed in the New York Times, Professor Randall Kennedy shared his concerns about student responses to the recent taping-over of the portraits of Harvard Law School’s black faculty. As he says, much of the unrest is not about the tape itself but about a conviction that the episode gives us a “revealing glimpse” into the “soul of Harvard Law School.” Professor Kennedy resists this conclusion. In his view, too many students are becoming “unglued,” seizing on “dubious” claims of racism at school, “nurturing an inflated sense of victimization,” and “minimizing” past victories.
Professor Kennedy’s op-ed reflects natural anxieties about change. Glue holds things together. Crisis pulls them apart. But glue can also cement centuries-old ideologies, making them hard to tear down even once they’ve been widely repudiated. Harvard Law School is glued together not by the supple bonds of a far-reaching fellowship, but by the hardened amber of a dominant class’s precedents and traditions.
We must come unglued. This is not to say that the school should be tossed into chaos. It is to say that we should finally and fully embrace the difficult task of understanding and reckoning with our history. We must acknowledge the magnitude of American racism—including the way it poisons our own community—and recognize the urgency of pulling it down.
Professor Kennedy accepts and knows well that “racism and its kindred pathologies” are “big foes.” And he grants that “some” students’ diagnoses “have a ring of validity.” Yet his instincts—informed by decades of wide reading and rich experience, no question—also tell him that those students may be “exaggerating” the forces of racism, thus making those forces seem “more formidable than they actually are.”
But what if these students, with their unique sets of experiences informed by their own reading of history, are more closely attuned than he realizes to some truly deep obstacles to change?
For instance, in Professor Kennedy’s view, “a decision by a professor to focus on a seemingly dry, technical issue rather than a more accessible, volatile subject involving race might well reflect a justifiable pedagogical strategy.” It might. But it also might reflect a yielding to inertia. And in this society, where the status quo secures the ill-got disproportionate power of white people, inertia is a formidable obstacle to change.
Issues of race are inextricably woven into the broad blanket of American law. The ideology of white supremacy and racial difference was at the epicenter of this society’s birth and upbringing. And it has settled deep in this country’s blood and bones, including in the gigantic, complex bundle of laws and court cases and customs that determine how we govern ourselves.
So when law schools presented with roomfuls of pliant young minds acquiesce in reducing major areas of law to “dry, technical issues,” they play a role in entrenching a system with racism in its marrow. For well-meaning people in certain positions, like those who teach tomorrow’s political leaders and wealth holders and judicial decision-makers, there arguably comes a point where dispassion amounts to endorsement. This is a formidable obstacle to change. (A related argument applies to students who, like me, too often fail to break silence in the classroom.)
There’s a similar counterpoint to Professor Kennedy’s argument that “opposition to racial affirmative action can stem from a wide range of sources other than prejudice.” That’s true, it can. But it often reflects a documented tendency of societies to legitimize the structures that have long secured dominant-group entitlements. Social psychologists call this tendency system justification theory. If this impulse to preserve the status quo drives much of the opposition to affirmative action, then it too is a formidable obstacle to change.
Harvard Law School vows in its mission statement “to educate leaders who contribute to the advancement of justice and the well-being of society.” To advance justice in our particular society, where the methodical administration of racial injustice has reigned for centuries, we must commit to uncovering the roots of the ideology of racial difference and breaking them out of the stubborn, hard-packed ground so many of us have comfortably trod for so long.
To many of those who have begun this project, Professor Kennedy imputes an “inflated sense of victimization.” In his view, “the right spirit” is simply to keep walking. But from where many students sit, the countless hours our peers have spent probing the depths of the racial divide at the law school and beyond are not the moanings of victims, but the toilings of those who take the schools’s mission statement most seriously. They are striving to reorder our law school and our society, and we should not let the hard old glue of yesterday’s prejudices slow them in their brave efforts to get us all unstuck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a faculty meeting Tuesday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Harvard’s House masters had unanimously agreed to change their title. The decision, said Khurana in an email to students later that evening, “makes sense on very many levels,” though he declined to specify their myriad multitudes. To us, the decision makes little sense at all.
Harvard is not the first school to reexamine the “master” title. This fall, the leader of Yale’s Pierson College dropped the moniker, and soon after Princeton’s residential college masters became “heads."
Students in favor of these changes claim the word “master” is too closely associated with slavery for comfort. What then will come for master’s degrees, or Harvard’s board of overseers, is unclear.
These misguided calls, which Khurana and the House masters have unfortunately chosen not only to take seriously but also to accede to, come amid protests over a lack of administrative racial sensitivity on campuses across the country. But unlike the movement to change Harvard Law School’s seal, currently the family crest of its slaveholding founding donor, the title of House master has never been associated with slavery.
Words are words. They have many meanings that change over time. Any supposed, tenuous connection between the academic title of master and slavery is grounded neither in history nor in reality, and is unlikely to have any real effect on race relations at Harvard. Rather than legitimizing these games of word association, Harvard and its administrators ought to spend time addressing actual issues of inclusivity on campus.
Switching the title to something that is sure to be more awkward and less apt—for a time, Mather House’s website requested that their masters be called “chief executive officers”—gives only the appearance of action without fully committing to it. They are superficial changes, which even Khurana appears unable to ground in substance. We look forward to a fuller explanation.
When we listen to complaints based on bad linguistics, when even etymologies become tools of oppression, we go too far. It sends us down the path of revising the names of all things plausibly found offensive—and eventually those not plausible as well. Our country’s past is fraught with racism, and the present is full of painful reminders. Some ongoing discussions about where flags, statutes, and symbols come from are worth having. But this is not one of them.
In his email, Khurana asks that we “renew the serious work” we all do. We hope he takes his own advice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 1, 2015, at 11:17 p.m.
The masters of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate residential Houses have unanimously agreed to change their title, a term that some students criticize as associated with slavery and has come under scrutiny as debates about racism take hold of college campuses nationwide.
College and House administrators will soon meet to select a new name to replace the “House master” title, according to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who informed the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of the decision at its monthly meeting on Tuesday. Khurana, himself a master of Cabot House, said he will inform the College of the new title early next year.  
Administrators and House masters acknowledged Tuesday that the move to abandon the term was in part prompted by recent protests against racism on campuses across the country; some Harvard students have called for changing it, and the title of the equivalent position at Yale has drawn particularly sharp criticism. Still, the conversation around the change is an old one, administrators said.
“The House Masters have unanimously expressed a desire to change their title,” Khurana told faculty members in a prepared statement at the meeting. “The recommendation to change the title has been a thoughtful one, rooted in a broad effort to ensure that the College’s rhetoric, expectations, and practices around our historically unique roles reflects and serves the 21st century needs of residential student life.”
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has approved the change and is “extremely supportive” of it, he said. University President Drew G. Faust also agrees with the move, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Last week, Khurana said he personally feels uncomfortable with the title and that the College’s House masters, faculty members who oversee student residences, have been discussing changing it for some time. While acknowledging that the title “master” can take on various meanings—it is often used to mean “teacher”—he also argued that it is important to consider the “social meaning” of the phrase.
“As someone who is responsible for and co-leads one of the Houses…. I have not felt comfortable personally with the title,” Khurana said in an interview.
Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr., a master of Winthrop House, called the change “the product of many years” of discussion, but said House masters collectively made the decision to change it in the past few weeks. That decision came in response to student requests and recent College and national protests over issues of race on college campuses, he said.
“We cannot ignore the fact that the term ‘master’ has a particular salience in our culture given the very real brutal history of slavery,” Sullivan said. “A new term that appreciates the realities of the work we do in the 21st century is much more appropriate.”
Especially given recent conversations on campus, Khurana said, “there was a sense that the time had come.”
Conversations about changing the title were ongoing even before Smith assumed the FAS deanship in 2007, he said.
“There’s no sense in putting this off any longer,” Smith said.
Administrators now must choose a title to replace the term “master.” Princeton recently renamed its residential college master position to “head of the college”; at Harvard, two House masters—Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten, who oversee Mather House—also recently began asking students to call them by another title. McDonald and Rosengarten updated Mather’s website sometime before last week so that it listed them as “chief executive officers” of the House.
That descriptor has since been removed from the site, but in an email, Rosengarten affirmed his discomfort with the “master” title. He has dropped the term from his position while waiting to form “a consensus for a new inclusive title,” he said.
“I understand the important historical roots of the title ‘Master’ at Oxford and Harvard, but I am sensitive to the context of the Houses today, and the issues of race which for many years have made me uncomfortable with the title,” Rosengarten wrote, adding that the alternative title of CEO “at least describes part of our job” but “is probably incomplete and leaves out the emphasis of creating a safe and supportive community.”
The impending change comes as Harvard and peer schools debate the use of names and terms historically associated with slavery and racism.
Harvard Law School is reconsidering the use of its seal, which a group of students criticize because of its  connection to a family that once owned slaves. At Yale, students have criticized the title of one student residence, named after John C. Calhoun, a former U.S. vice president, white supremacist, and vocal proponent of slavery. A group of Princeton students, meanwhile, is demanding that the university change the name of a student residence and its public policy school to remove association with former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson because of his record of racism.

The Harvard Extension School will offer a combined bachelor’s and master’s degree program next year, a first for the school.
The program’s inaugural cohort of students will begin online coursework in June and earn a Bachelor of Liberal Arts degree in global studies and a Master of Liberal Arts in management. 
While the Extension School has offered “blended” on-campus and online degree-granting programs, the school will choose participants in the new program through a selective application process from a pool of applicants who have not previously taken Extension School courses. This marks a departure from other Extension school degree programs, which mandate that students meet certain grade requirements in three Extension School “admission courses,” among other criteria, to apply.
The entire program, according to the Extension School’s website, will cost roughly $45,000, a price point that Ray Schroeder, the associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield, called “tremendous.”
The program asks that applicants have at least two years of undergraduate coursework and roughly seven to 10 years of “professional experience” under their belts. Applicants should not, however, have taken any previous courses at the Extension School or Harvard Summer School.
The program appears to have been designed to “appeal to a circumscribed group of students,” Schroeder suggested. 
Suzanne Spreadbury, Harvard’s associate dean of academic programs and University extension, said she encountered many such “potential completers” during her role as an undergraduate adviser at the Extension School.
The program has received 20 applications already and will accept more through mid-January. The Extension School will place admitted students in 15-person “cohorts” to complete their coursework; the school has yet to decide how many cohorts it will take.
“This program is not for the faint of heart,” Spreadbury wrote in an email. “If we can only find 15 students for this first time around that meet those qualifications, then we will only admit 15.”
The new program will consist of 18 online courses throughout the fall and spring semesters and six on-campus courses during three intensive summer sessions over the course of the four-year program. Each will last for three weeks,
The program’s structure closely resembles the School of Public Health’s blended Master of Public Health in Epidemiology program, which also features intensive summer sessions paired with term-time online courses.
“We certainly were inspired by [the School of Public Health’s] design because it was very very intriguing,” said Spreadbury, though she said she did not speak with anyone at the School of Public Health formally.
While the blended epidemiology program is operating in a test period, Spreadbury said the Extension School does not need special license for its program, and administrators plan to make it permanent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter addressed a packed crowd at Harvard’s Institute of Politics on Tuesday night, touching on U.S. military recruitment, efforts to eliminate the Islamic State, and disputes in the South China Sea.
Despite calling the U.S. military the “finest fighting force in the world,” Carter pointed out what he described as the trend of technological innovation shifting away from the U.S. government toward the private sector. He stressed the need to rebuild trust with technology companies and recruit top-flight talent.
“In order to remain the best...we need to have access to the best technology,” Carter said.
Carter, who previously served as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, praised Boston and Cambridge area leadership in life science research and the biotechnology sector as an example of what the military is looking for in its next generation of leaders. 

Carter, in an earlier interview, also brought up the the Defense Department’s new initiative, the Force of the Future, which aims to improve the Department’s recruitment of top talent.
“I’m very intent upon making us a more attractive and welcoming place for a new generation of people,” he said.
Specific reforms include improving internships and fellowships aimed at college students and graduates, creating more positions for civilians in technology and human resources, and providing opportunities for employees to both gain experience in the private sector and implement successful approaches in the military.
Carter also discussed the U.S. military’s ongoing efforts to eliminate the extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State. Those efforts include using both airstrikes and an “expeditionary force” that would perform raids and gather intelligence in Islamic State territory with the approval of local governments, Carter said.
He also emphasized the importance of a collective effort, saying that other important actors, like Russia and local Syrian and Iraqi forces, need to play their parts as well in combating terrorism.
“The U.S. is, and I think must, lead in this fight,” Carter said. “But we need others to go with us.”
Speaking about disputes in the South China Sea, Carter criticized the territorial claims and militarization, as well as efforts to dredge new islands, made by China and other countries, calling them damaging to stability in the region.
“I’m not one of the people who believes that war, cold or otherwise, with China is likely,” Carter said.  “Certainly not desirable.”
Carter argued that maintaining peace in Asia through diplomacy and inclusion is of the greatest long-term importance: This goal, he said, necessitates resolving territorial disputes peacefully and working with countries like China to combat piracy and human trafficking and to promote free commerce.
“Our approach is not to exclude—our approach is to include,” Carter said. “But if they self-exclude by behaving this way, then look what will happen.”
When asked by audience members about religious freedom, sexual assault in the military, and cyber security, Carter stressed the importance of being inclusive and transparent to attract people from all backgrounds to the Defense Department.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 4, 2015, at 6:46 p.m.
As a student with a cochlear implant, a device that replaces the function of the damaged inner ear, Westley “West” A. Resendes ’12 originally came to Harvard identifying as a hearing impaired person.
Upon arriving at Harvard, however, he reached out to University Disability Services and inquired about other deaf students. He was invited to an American Sign Language, or ASL, table that met during dinner in Leverett House, where he met other students who were either deaf themselves or advocates, including the leaders of the Committee on Deaf Awareness, or CODA.
Resendes, despite being able to hear with his cochlear implant, began identifying as culturally deaf—or “Deaf” with a capital “D,” a word he said serves as a more universal term that can refer both to physical hearing loss as well as associating with the culture surrounding deafness.
“As I signed with my peers at that table for the first time in so many years, I felt invigorated, as I was rediscovering this part of me that had been hidden for so long,” Resendes said. “I realized that perhaps being deaf was not just a handicap to overcome, that it was a doorway into a rich and vibrant culture worth embracing.”
Pivotal to him calling himself a culturally “Deaf” person, Resendes said his involvement with CODA allowed him to reevaluate his identity and seek to understand the barriers that Deaf students—physically and culturally—face.
Harvard’s resources work to ensure that there are no academic barriers for deaf students. Still, some students say that Harvard needs to offer American Sign Language as a for-credit class—something done at many peer institutions, including Brown and the University of Pennsylvania—to fully welcome Deaf students to the University.
EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES
Harvard’s resources for deaf students have certainly seen improvements in the past decade. Caroline M. Solomon ’96, a deaf biology professor at Gallaudet University—a leading school for the deaf and hard of hearing—said there were no staff interpreters when she arrived at Harvard. Halfway through her first semester, however, the school hired an interpreter full time, who stayed with her for the next four years.
Today, deaf and hard-of-hearing students on campus can request specific accommodations. This often includes interpreters attending class with students who identify as culturally deaf, meaning they communicate solely or primarily through sign language, often have Deaf friends and family, and identify with Deaf culture.
While the interpreters are vital, they can often be confusing or discomforting to students who are unfamiliar with the experience of being deaf, according to some students.
Heather S. Artinian, a culturally deaf first-year student at Harvard Law School, has a team of two interpreters who attend all her classes. Several members of Artinian’s family are deaf and identify heavily with Deaf culture, so she grew up using sign language. She was born unable to hear, but when she was 10 years old, she received two cochlear implants, learned how to speak English, and switched from a school for deaf children to a mainstream one.
“I’ve kind of been going to school with the hearing world for a long time. And every time I go to a new environment it is always that cultural shock for everyone else,” Artinian said.
According to Artinian, many of her peers have never met or interacted with a deaf person—physically or culturally—and are unsure how to communicate with her. During the first few weeks of any class, she makes sure to introduce herself, explain that she can hear with her cochlear implants, and tell others to tap her on the shoulder if she does not hear them.
Her cochlear implants aid Artinian’s hearing and make it easier her to have conversations with one or a few people, but in large groups or at large events she still prefers to use an interpreter to help.
“I have interpreters here, so if I’m walking into a classroom, you see [all of us],” Artinian said. “I call them ‘my people’—and they are really great—but people get intimidated.”
Artinian said Harvard’s resources are exceptional, and she never experiences problems requesting interpreters for outside events. She only needs to submit a request.
Resendes, who was the director of CODA when he was an undergraduate, also praised the resources Harvard provided to him. He had interpreters for lectures, sections, and thesis meetings, as well as outside events at the Kennedy School of Government and Kirkland House.
“One memorable instance was an interpreted Harvard Humanist of the Year award ceremony at Memorial Church,” Resendes said, fondly remembering one such event. “‘Family Guy’ creator Seth MacFarlane discovered that his talk was being interpreted and took that opportunity to learn the signs of some vulgar words by saying them and watching the interpreter sign them.”
One distinction between Resendes’s experience and non-Deaf students’ was that he had to solidify his schedule, sometimes weeks in advance, to secure an interpreter.
“There were occasions when interpreters were unavailable for a lecture or a meeting, and I either decided to skip the event or decided to go and try my best to understand what was going on. Fortunately, those instances were few and far between,” Resendes said.
Still, these positive reviews of Harvard’s resources are not universal. Sarah D. Gluck, a deaf graduate student pursuing a degree in speech and hearing bioscience and technology, said University Disability Services is not as efficient as it could be in allotting interpreters for outside events.
Gluck graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology, a school she said had a notably large Deaf community and resources for Deaf students.  She points to University Disability Services’ policies—requiring students to place interpreter requests for outside events with two to three weeks notice, if possible—as a source of frustration.
“Hearing students have the privilege of walking through the hallway and seeing a poster for something, like a science lecture or talk that’s happening that day or later that week, but it’s hard for me to have any sort of spontaneity,” Gluck said.
Gluck said this makes it difficult to become involved with things outside of the classroom. She said she would have liked to attend a recent meeting held by a group of graduate students trying to unionize, for example, but she could not secure an interpreter for the event.
Michele Clopper, the interim director of University Disability Services, declined an interview request, but said in a statement that the office encourage students to “make their other needs known for providers as soon as possible” and that Harvard “makes every effort to secure services but they are subject to availability.”
ASL AND HARVARD’S DEAF COMMUNITY
While many peer institutions work offer American Sign Language as a for-credit class, Harvard does not provide this option, and some Deaf students and advocates say it should to better integrate them into the campus community.
In the 1990s, Harvard’s Linguistics Department offered ASL classes but canceled them in response to financial constraints. Today, the only formal ASL instruction at Harvard is offered by CODA, which runs classes on Sundays in three different levels of difficulty for no credit. Because an outside ASL instructor, who CODA hires, teaches those classes, students must pay for them out of pocket.
According to CODA’s director, Erica X Eisen ’16, the organization began offering those weekend classes because Harvard removed ASL as a for-credit language course option.
Eisen, a former Crimson Arts chair, co-led a movement last year to put a question calling for Harvard to reintroduce for-credit ASL classes on the Undergraduate Council’s fall election ballot. The measure passed with overwhelming support, prompting the UC to advocate for CODA and their push for ASL course options.
Progress halted, according to Resendes, when administrators indicated that Harvard will only offer a language class if at least one student has a “demonstrated academic interest” in it—that is, the intention of conducting research on ASL.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, his office can arrange language tutorials if students demonstrate that they will do research related to that language.
“We are happy to arrange classes for students who can articulate a research agenda that involves the study of that language and a faculty member who is willing to supervise that research,” Harris said.
Resendes, who attempted to fulfill his Harvard foreign language requirement with ASL but whose request was denied, called that standard “rather unfair...considering other languages can be taken for pleasure at Harvard.”
“The University needs to reconsider its outdated position on ASL,” he argued.
ASL is the third most common language, other than English, taken by college students nationally as of the fall of 2013, according to the Modern Language Association’s most recent report. In line with these statistics, many of Harvard’s peer institutions have begun to offer it as a for-credit course.
Brown has offered ASL since 1995 and for credit since 2005, according to Timothy B. Riker, a visiting lecturer in ASL there. At the University of Pennsylvania, students may pursue ASL for credit and even a Deaf Studies minor; according to Jami N. Fisher, the ASL program coordinator at Penn, the school has offered ASL since 1996, and it has fulfilled the world language requirement since 2001.
Offering ASL classes at Harvard could mitigate the stigma that has historically surrounded deafness, integrate Deaf students in the campus, and expose other students to a new culture and community, Gluck said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The force was strong at Harvard Law School on Tuesday during a talk by professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75, who discussed his upcoming book, “The World According to Star Wars.”
The talk drew more than 200 people, filling a conference room decorated in honor of “Star Wars.” Sunstein presented from in front of a podium alongside life-sized cardboard cutouts of characters, including General Leia Organa and Finn from the upcoming movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”
Sunstein began by joking about how his lifelong love of “Star Wars” has helped shape his decision-making—first as an academic, then while working as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under the Obama administration, and lastly as a father.
He offered a range of theories as to the secrets behind popularity and financial success “Star Wars.”
“One hypothesis is that it’s just too awesome not to [have become popular],” he said. “It fit with the temper of the times, or the Zeitgeist.”
He went on to posit that the first Star Wars movie was released in 1977 to an American public still reeling from the Vietnam War and looking for “something a little like July 4th...a national celebration.”
Sunstein later moved abruptly from fan theories to constitutional law, often drawing laughter from the crowd for weaving concepts from “Star Wars” into the discussion.
Sunstein compared several critical points in U.S. judicial history to what he called “I am your father moments,” a reference to a famous plot twist in the trilogy in which Darth Vader reveals himself to be Luke Skywalker’s father. Sunstein defined each of these moments as “a switch that the court pulled on longstanding doctrine,” providing examples such as when the court “constitutionalized commercial speech as a free speech entity” in the 1970s among others.
Near the end of the event, audience members engaged in a question-and-answer session with Sunstein, surrounded by tables adorned with blue and red TIE Fighter-emblazed balloons and X-wing starfighter confetti.

In honor of World AIDS Day, Harvard students and affiliates gathered Tuesday evening in two forums to pay tribute to people who have lost their lives to the disease, celebrate the strides made by activists, and call for further progress.
At the Cambridge Friends Meeting House, people gathered to reflect and honor victims of the disease and “make a commitment to continue living in love.” Attendees participated in a series of meditations and prayers, while two people who have lived with HIV shared their stories. The group also heard music and paused for a period of silent reflection.
Roderick L. Owens, a Divinity School student who organized the event, led a series of chants and prayers.
“AIDS calls us to a deeper sense of sensitivity, of humility, to confront our own mortality and the way we judge and label others,” Owens said. “I see so much of that as the work of AIDS: cutting through and eradicating these stereotypes and labels.” 
Also on Tuesday evening, a group gathered in the rain on the steps of Memorial Church to light candles in remembrance of the lives lost to HIV and AIDS. The vigil, hosted by the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition, featured three speakers who discussed the injustices of the global AIDS pandemic and called for further action.
“Thirty-four years into this pandemic, AIDS stands as a testament to the urgency of urgencies, to the need to insist on immediacy and the importance of every single life,” said Joaquin S. Terrones, a guest speaker and a preceptor for the Expository Writing class “HIV/AIDS in Culture.”
At both events, speakers described the personal grief that HIV causes.
Patrick Langone, who has lived with HIV/AIDS for years, reflected on his day-to-day experience with the disease and the struggle of losing close friends along his journey. Langone closed his remarks with a consoling message to youth affected by the disease, assuring them that individuals can live productive, fulfilling lives with HIV/AIDS.
He called for educating young people so that they have a deeper knowledge and understanding of the disease.
“These kids have to have the information presented to them, and we can each do it in our own way,” Langone said. “We all have a loud voice if we know how to use it.” 
The younger generation of Harvard students also spoke about the relevance of World AIDS Day at the vigil.
“For me, this is a day to mourn all the progress and the action that we didn’t take earlier, but also, to look ahead and ask, ‘How do we catch up?’” Shayla B. Partridge ’18 said. “And maybe at some time, we won’t have to have a World AIDS Day, many many generations from now.”
Speakers encouraged Harvard students to not only feel for the victims of HIV, but also to take action, like bringing attention to funding the fight against the disease through petitions and protests.

Professors overwhelmingly praised a proposal to renew the College’s General Education program—a drastic overhaul of the curriculum previously deemed “failing on a variety of fronts”—at the semester’s final meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on Tuesday.
Drafted by the Gen Ed review committee chaired by Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, the proposal outlines a Gen Ed program that would include distribution requirements, fewer but consolidated general education courses, and one quantitative-based course. Kelly, who described the program on Tuesday as a “penultimate draft,” said the committee will finalize legislation for the program next month. Faculty members will likely vote to approve it in the spring.
At the meeting on Tuesday, a handful of faculty members offered their feedback on the proposal, each prefacing their remarks with praise for the committee’s work. Several professors said the new program clarifies Gen Ed’s three central aims: to prepare students for a life of civic engagement, teach them about a range of disciplines, and give them flexibility in their academic schedules. 
Still, some faculty members suggested additions to the proposal. In particular, they argued that the new program should not abandon the current mandate that students take a course that engages significantly with studies of the past.
Music professor Vijay Iyer also suggested that the new curriculum include courses that focus on or cover topics of diversity and inclusion, a request that echoes a recent College report that called for the Gen Ed program to recruit faculty members to teach courses on diversity.
In response to those concerns, Kelly cautioned against creating Gen Ed categories that are too narrow, arguing that they would not be effective.
“We thought the program would have a better chance of standing a longer time if we had the requirements at a sort of meta level,” Kelly said. “The more we add details to the program, the more we fear we undermine the identity and make it harder to understand what the program is about,” he added later.
The Gen Ed proposal also recommends that administrators increase financial support for the program. Faculty discussion on Tuesday did not focus on that point, but after the meeting, Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall described the issue of administrative support as key to the success of a new program.
“What’s going to be crucial in the next few months is seeing what kinds of resources the administration can bring to bear,” said Hall, who is also chair of the Gen Ed committee.
In an interview, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said he is unsure how much money the new program will require. Given the newly definitive proposal, though, Smith said he will begin to speak with potential donors about Gen Ed more specifically as he fundraises for Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, now in its third year.
Speaking to the new Gen Ed program’s timeline, Smith said he expects that it “would be difficult” to implement it by next fall, given associated administrative changes. The Gen Ed review committee will draft legislation on the new program to distribute to faculty in January, Smith said, and they will not vote on the program until at least March.
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, faculty heard from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who informed them that the masters of the College’s 12 residential Houses had unanimously agreed to change their title, which students have criticized as associated with slavery.
Human Evolutionary Biology professor David R. Pilbeam also presented a report on behalf of a committee studying the importance of student body diversity, separate from another report on diversity that the College released late last month. Faculty members will vote on whether to endorse the presented report’s conclusions “as a statement of values embraced by the Faculty” at its first meeting of the spring semester in February.

Retired Burlington, Vt., police chief Thomas R. Tremblay advocated for having “courageous” community conversations about preventing sexual assault and effective bystander intervention in a lecture on Tuesday organized by Harvard’s Title IX Office.
“It’s hard to talk about sex. It’s hard to talk about sexual assault,” Tremblay said. “It takes courage to have a conversation.”
Tremblay argued for the importance of changing the societal mentality surrounding sexual assault, and specifically said men and women must work together to raise sexual assault awareness.
“We need more young men. We need young men and young women to stand together,” he said. “When men and women stand together and share a message around prevention and awareness, that has a lot of power.”
Tremblay also described how alcohol is used as both a weapon and a shield by rapists. Through talking to perpetrators of sexual assault, Tremblay said, he found that they often did not use a knife or a gun to commit assault because those provided clear examples of evidence. But alcohol, he said, provided them an excuse or cover-up method.
Still, Tremblay said alcohol itself is not the root of the problem, even if it is deeply entangled with the prevalence of sexual assault.
“Alcohol doesn’t cause sexual assault,” he said. “Choices cause sexual assault.”
Speaking to Harvard specifically, Tremblay praised administrators’ responses to the results of the University’s sexual conduct climate survey, which were released in September, as leading the way in highlighting sexual assault as a prevalent issue. He referenced the response of University President Drew G. Faust, who described sexual assault as “our problem” in an email following the survey’s release, as a step in the right direction.
Tremblay closed with a call to action, asking audience members to be leaders in sexual assault awareness and prevention by standing up when something seems wrong. That is the only way to make a true difference, he argued.
“Leaders have courageous conversations. Leaders take action. And each one of you in this room have an opportunity to be a leader,” Tremblay said.
Tremblay’s viewpoints on sexual assault resonated with members of the audience. Several administrators attended, including Mather House dean Luke Leafgren and Carol K. Bates, the associate dean of faculty affairs at Harvard Medical School and a Title IX coordinator for faculty there.

UPDATED: December 3, 2015, at 5:41 p.m.
Twenty-one Harvard faculty and graduate students have voted or signed a petition to place a controversial resolution to boycott Israeli academic institutions on the American Anthropological Association’s spring ballot.
The resolution supports the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement issued by Palestinian civil society, which calls for academic associations to refrain from formal collaboration with Israeli academic institutions.
Considered by the more than 1,400 members present at the AAA’s annual meeting in Denver late last month, the resolution must garner a favorable vote from a simple majority of the organization’s entire membership of more than 10,000 members in April to go into effect. It is part of a growing academic movement to boycott Israeli institutions in the midst of ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinians.
While the proposed academic boycott of Israeli institutions would not prevent Israeli academics from publishing in AAA journals, it would prevent journals based at Israeli institutions from reprinting or copying articles from AAA publications, according to the resolution appendix. Israeli institutions would also be barred from participating in certain AAA events.
Harvard Anthropology professor Steven C. Caton, who attended the conference and voted for the resolution, argued that it stands to make a strong statement against Israeli academic institutions and what he characterized as the country’s mistreatment of Palestinians.
“I am an educator and belong to the education establishment. I think of this as another tactic to limit Israel’s aggression,” said Caton, who works alongside graduate and post-doctoral students from Israel on various research projects.
Harvard faculty also cited their studies of human systems as a motivating factor in their decision to vote for the resolution. Ajantha Subramanian, a professor of anthropology and South Asian studies, related her work on colonialism and rights politics and the ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians to her decision to support the resolution. She cited obstacles Palestinians face in obtaining an education as a reason for supporting it.
Faculty who voted in support of the resolution said they have faced backlash as a result of their vote.
Some professors at Harvard, meanwhile, have voiced opposition to it. Ofer Bar-Yosef, a professor emeritus of prehistoric archaeology who currently resides in his home country of Israel, disagrees with the resolution.
“The AAA resolution does not reflect what anthropologists can contribute for conflict resolution. It is simply a political manifest against Israel,” Bar-Yosef wrote in an email, also characterizing many of the claims made in the AAA resolution as untrue.
Peter Machinist, a professor of Hebrew and other Oriental languages who is not a member of the Anthropology department, also voiced concerns with the resolution, writing in an email, “I do object seriously to this boycott as a real violation of the kind of free exchange of ideas and relationships that is fundamental to scholarship and to life in general.”
Machinist also questioned targeting Israeli institutions when human rights violations are occurring in other countries around the world. “Why single out Israel, as is done regularly in such cases, and not consider a range of other countries whose behavior is outrageous?” he wrote.
Several other associations based in the U.S. have also supported the boycott, including the Association for Asian American Studies and the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months before the Fox Club, one of Harvard’s historically male final clubs, broke from 117 years of tradition to accept women to its membership for the first time, a group of undergraduate members made a plan.
The students, considering changing the club’s status quo even before administrative scrutiny of the groups came to a head this year, contemplated how a move to go co-ed would change the dynamics of its membership. They questioned which members would use which bathrooms in their clubhouse on JFK Street, debated how the club would address allegations of sexual assault between members, and suggested that elements of the group’s initiation process might need to change. They even brainstormed accessories that women members could wear in place of the traditional Fox Club tie.
Those recommendations, detailed in an undated report from a group dubbed the “The Fox Club Task Force On Gender Inclusivity” and recently obtained by The Crimson, suggest that Fox undergraduates spent months planning its move to go co-ed. According to the report, they pitched plans to facilitate the transition and maintain positive relations with their graduate board, which as early as last year explicitly opposed the move and recently shut down the club in the midst of controversy.
The document, titled “Primary Logistical Concerns Addressed,” details the logistical challenges of the change. It begins with a single bolded question: “how would we facilitate the introduction of females into the membership?”
Surveying potential worries within three main categories—the selection process, initiation, and membership policies—the report, in a question-and-answer format, responds to possible concerns with lists of options. Notably, the report outlines strategies to ensure that the club’s membership would be chosen independently of what it terms “superficial criteria,” such as physical appearance; that a plan is in place to address romantic relations between prospective and full members; and that women feel comfortable during the selection and initiation processes.
But the report also indicates that Fox undergraduates had to consider more fundamental changes to their initiation process and policies, and how to preserve graduate board relations, as they considered going co-ed. Specifically, the report questions whether the club should integrate women into initiation events involving nudity and alcohol, or remove those events altogether. It also suggests that the Fox lacked a formalized sexual assault policy at the time of the report, prompting undergraduates to recommend creating one.
‘CAREFULLY STUDIED’
The Fox Club’s decision to go co-ed this October was not the first time undergraduates in the off-campus social organization had proposed admitting women. In 2014, when some Fox undergraduates advocated adding women to the group, their graduate board leadership responded with a clear imperative: Conduct research and draft reports.
Reverend Douglas W. Sears ’69, then the Fox’s graduate board president, said last year that he advised one undergraduate member who was leading a push for the club to go co-ed to write a position paper on the implications of such a change. And when Fox undergraduates detailed the rationale behind their decision to ask a group of women to join the club in a letter to graduates this October, they acknowledged that they had met some graduate pushback.
Still, they argued that undergraduates had drafted a report “on the advantages and disadvantages of going coed” and pitched it as an informed decision, if one expedited by pressure from Harvard administrators. They indicated that work on the report began more than a year ago.
“Issues like club identity, logistics, criteria for membership, culture and tradition were carefully studied, and a plan was developed to admit women in a way that would not dilute or alter the most important aspects of the Fox experience,” they wrote.
It remains unclear whether the undated report from the Fox’s task force was sparked by the request from Sears, or whether it is the same one undergraduates referenced in their Oct. 19 letter. The Fox’s undergraduate president, Daniel T. Skarzynski ’16, and vice president, Patrick E. Dowling ’16, declined to comment for this story.
The report, which issues a range of possible solutions to concerns associated with going co-ed, does not make conclusions on what path the club should take, nor does it indicate whether undergraduates would vote on it in any form.
Undergraduates seemed particularly worried about how inviting women to participate in the traditional final club selection process, the period in the fall known as punch, could change the one purported criterion for entry—“will they be my friend?”
Among other concerns, the report asked, “How will we prevent members from selecting candidates based on appearance/attraction/more superficial criteria?”
So as to make sure that members judge prospective initiates, male and female, responsibly, the report suggests that the Fox undergraduate president reiterate during punch deliberations that “friendship” should be “the only standard for election.” Potential problems with attraction between members of the opposite sex would be “further diffused” as more women joined the club, making the issue “insignificant,” the report indicated.
“If the length and freedom of discussion currently present at deliberations is maintained, then it is unlikely that the factor of attraction would not be raised if any present member felt it was swaying members to a particular decision,” the report also suggested.
The report also presents a number of proposals to combat the potential for an “imbalanced power dynamic” to develop between the club’s older male members and its first female punch class. One point suggested only admitting junior and senior female students for the first co-ed class. Another advocated appointing a number of senior female members as “punch liaisons” to guide the punch process and respond to concerns from prospective female members.
This fall, the Fox ultimately elected a group of junior and senior female undergraduates who plan to lead an all-female punch process next semester, although their graduate board has since assigned them, and new male members, a provisional status.
One anticipated concern with the Fox’s admission policy was how it would react to an increase in legacy candidates, according to the task force report. By letting women punch, both the sons and daughters of club alumni would now be considered legacies—a status that at some final clubs greatly increases a prospective member’s chance of admission. The report suggests balancing the need to be “judicious” in the election process with “maintaining positive graduate relations.”
Beyond just admissions questions, the report delves into the minute procedural details of the punch process, addressing questions such as whether the club should allow punches to bring each other as dates to punch events. It offers several options: Officers could either permit or forbid that arrangement, hold separate date events for women, or eliminate date events altogether.
Officers could also change the requisite attire for punch events from “coat and tie” to “semi-formal” or “cocktail attire,” the report recommends. It suggests that the Fox could designate some bathrooms, meanwhile, as specifically for women, or the club could install locks and make all of them unisex.
Beyond those logistics, the report covers questions about how officers would navigate potential romantic relationships between members and initiates if women joined the club.
While the report notes that the club already had experience addressing existing relationships between members and punches, it implies that the issue would come up more frequently if it went co-ed. The Fox could require members who are in relationships with prospective members to recuse themselves from deliberating on their election, the report suggests, a policy it says the club should “potentially” adopt regardless.
“Such a situation has already arisen in recent club history, and requires the same maturity and caution of members that is already expected of them during deliberations,” the report says.
The document is clear that officers would expect club members to behave appropriately around women punches. “We expect male punches to behave around female punches the way male members ought to behave around female members. Any indication of punches unwilling or unable to do so will factor into the deliberation process,” the report proposes.
The report also says the Fox could ban relationships between two members, and if adopted, such a policy should also apply to relationships between prospective members.
The report also offers ways to formalize a policy on romantic relationships between members, instead of prohibiting them. The club could allow consensual relationships or “institute a policy of ‘don't ask, don't tell’ regarding member-member relations, asking members to be discreet about their intra-club relationships, and to respect that the purpose of the Fox club is primarily to build and maintain friendship.”
‘INSTITUTE A POLICY’
Beyond punch, the Fox’s report also indicates that undergraduates mulled over club initiation events, specifically questioning the place of nudity and alcohol. They also thought generally about how the club would respond to allegations of sexual harassment.
The report asks, “How will we deal with situations involving nudity, or any other situations that might engender potential sexual or personal discomfort amongst initiates?”
First, the report suggests that the Fox could eliminate initiation events involving “nudity or uncomfortable situations.” Alternatively, it proposes continuing them and maintaining the club’s existing initiation policy—which the report indicates involved telling initiates that all activities are “always” optional—or instituting new ways initiates can alert club members if they feel uncomfortable. Or, the report says, the club could host separate initiation events for men and women.
The report also addresses alcohol and how members could make sure women do not feel pressured to drink during initiations. The Fox could continue emphasizing that consumption of alcohol is optional, use senior female punch liaisons to ensure “no initiate is feeling inordinate pressure of any kind,” or eliminate alcohol from the process, the report says.
In several sections, including one on potential liability issues, the report also outlines in detail how club members could respond to sexual assault allegations.
The report recommends that officers institute a formal policy outlining the club’s sexual harassment response protocol—the implication being that it may not, at the time of the report, have had one in place.
The report says the Fox could develop one in collaboration with Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response—a University office with which the Fox had been building a relationship, according to the report. That would likely involve establishing confidential liaisons who could serve as point people to receive reports of sexual harassment and a clear policy detailing legal and disciplinary action the complainant can pursue, the report says.
Notably, the report also suggests that if the Fox were officially recognized by the College—it is not now, as the historically male final clubs cut ties with Harvard in 1984—the club could adopt the University’s own sexual harassment policies. Under that method, the report suggests, members would file complaints directly with Harvard through avenues such as the centralized Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution. A combination of those suggestions would reduce liability concerns if the club went co-ed, the report argued.
“With the institution of a concrete sexual assault policy, as well as an improved relationship with OSAPR, we would have a much more robust platform of support in the event of situations involving sexual harassment/assault,” it says.
If recognized by Harvard, the club could potentially fall under the purview of the Harvard University Police Department, rather than Cambridge police, the report adds. It suggested that such an arrangement could reduce the liability associated with the police shutting down parties.
But for the time being, the Fox’s future is in limbo. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a critic of single-gendered social organizations, has been working on a set of proposals about the College’s social scene, but he has been largely quiet on what plans he has for final clubs. And the Fox Club itself is shut down until at least the start of next year as its graduate board leaders reexamine the state of affairs at their historically male social organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 2, 2015, at 5:59 p.m.
Before the Fox Club, one of Harvard’s historically male final clubs, broke from 117 years of tradition to accept women to its membership for the first time, a group of undergraduate members made a plan. 
The students, who had considered changing the club’s status quo even before administrative scrutiny of the groups came to a head this year, contemplated how a move to go co-ed would change the dynamics of its membership. They questioned which members would use which bathrooms in their clubhouse on JFK Street, debated how the club would address allegations of sexual assault between members, and suggested that elements of the group’s initiation process might need to change. They even brainstormed accessories that women members could wear in place of the traditional Fox Club tie.
Those recommendations, detailed in an undated report from a group dubbed the “The Fox Club Task Force On Gender Inclusivity” and recently obtained by The Crimson, shed light on the factors Fox undergraduates considered as they planned their move to go co-ed. According to the report, they pitched plans to facilitate the transition and maintain positive relations with their graduate board, which as early as last year explicitly opposed the move and recently shut down the club in the midst of controversy.
The document, titled “Primary Logistical Concerns Addressed,” details the logistical challenges of the change. It begins with a single bolded question: “how would we facilitate the introduction of females into the membership?”
Surveying potential worries within three main categories—the selection process, initiation, and membership policies—the report, in a question-and-answer format, responds to possible concerns with lists of options. Notably, the report outlines strategies to ensure that the club’s membership would be chosen independently of what it terms “superficial criteria,” such as physical appearance; that a plan is in place to address romantic relations between prospective and full members; and that women feel comfortable during the selection and initiation processes.
But the report also indicates that Fox undergraduates had to consider more fundamental changes to their initiation process and policies, and how to preserve graduate board relations, as they considered going co-ed. Specifically, the report questions whether the club should integrate women into initiation events involving nudity and alcohol, or remove those events altogether. It also suggests that the Fox lacked a formalized sexual assault policy at the time of the report, prompting undergraduates to recommend creating one.
‘CAREFULLY STUDIED’
The Fox Club’s decision to go co-ed this October was not the first time undergraduates in the off-campus social organization had proposed admitting women. In 2014, when some Fox undergraduates advocated adding women to the group, their graduate board leadership responded with a clear imperative: Conduct research and draft reports.
Reverend Douglas W. Sears ’69, then the Fox’s graduate board president, said last year that he advised one undergraduate member who was leading a push for the club to go co-ed to write a position paper on the implications of such a change. And when Fox undergraduates detailed the rationale behind their decision to ask a group of women to join the club in a letter to graduates this October, they acknowledged that they had met some graduate pushback.

The Fox’s undergraduate president, Daniel T. Skarzynski ’16, and vice president, Patrick E. Dowling ’16, declined to comment for this story. 
The report, which issues a range of possible solutions to concerns associated with going co-ed, does not make conclusions on what path the club should take, nor does it indicate whether undergraduates would vote on it in any form.
Members of the Fox did not vote on the report, according to one active club graduate member, who said members viewed the report as an aggregation of options in the context of broader discussions about admitting women to the club.
Undergraduates seemed particularly worried about how inviting women to participate in the traditional final club selection process, the period in the fall known as punch, could change the one purported criterion for entry—“will they be my friend?”
Among other concerns, the report asked, “How will we prevent members from selecting candidates based on appearance/attraction/more superficial criteria?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As my co-writer and I walked down to the sideline of Jordan Field this past Halloween, I could not help but notice how eerily quiet the Harvard men’s soccer bench, one that had been yelling at both players and refs alike all night, had gotten.
In the background, I’m sure a victorious Dartmouth team was celebrating an overtime golden goal that effectively clinched its second consecutive conference title, but all I remember was the silence on the other end, as if the Big Green players were not even there.
It felt like a scene from a boxing movie where the protagonist gets knocked down, and despite there clearly being people making noise in the background, the movie goes mute and the world seems to stop as the main character attempts to get back up.
As we approached senior forward Jake Freeman, I felt horrible.
The last thing I wanted to do was make him relive this game, especially when there was no doubt in my mind he was trying to move past it ever since the ball whizzed into the back of the Crimson net.
I did not know what to expect as my co-writer started to ask him about the game.
“It hurts right now,” Freeman responded. “But we still have two games left, and anything can happen. You don’t know.”
A few minutes later as I walked back across the river, I could not stop thinking of that interview.
Right before that response, Freeman’s voice had been shaky, and it seemed at one point like he would be unable to continue.
Yet, in that moment, the senior collected himself and firmly asserted that there was still hope, defying the distraught vibe that had been there just a few seconds before.
Freeman could have broken down, he could have said he needed a few seconds to gather himself. But instead, he insisted there was still fight left in his team.
That moment, I realized later on, epitomized the Harvard men’s soccer team.
This was a team that entered the season on a wave of hype and high expectations after two consecutive top-three finishes in the Ancient Eight before suffering a devastating personnel blow upon losing the 2014 Ivy League Defender of the Year, co-captain Mark Ashby, to injury.
This was a team that picked up only one win in its first seven games of the year but surprised many by roaring back to life at the start of Ivy League play, rattling off five wins in a row—three of them in conference games, the first three-game winning streak to start conference play since 2007.
This was a team that went down 3-1 to Princeton at home but continued to press relentlessly in the second half, closing the gap to one with just a few minutes left before coming a few yards from evening the score, ultimately falling just short.
This was a team that after losing in heartbreaking fashion to Dartmouth—a game that could have gone the Crimson’s way had a takedown of Freeman in the box been deemed a penalty—bounced back to defeat Columbia, 2-0, on the road before returning to Cambridge to rout Penn, 6-0, on Senior Night.
This was a team that had its back against the wall on multiple occasions, a team that looked down for the count after a handful of games, but continued to get back up for the next fight, regardless of prior results or how beat up the team was.
This team was the protagonist that, after absorbing every single knockdown it suffered, got back up and delivered punch after punch until the very end.
Just a few days after delivering its final punch on Senior Night, Harvard found out that its last-minute frenzy that night had not been enough to warrant its inclusion in the NCAA tournament.
Just when it seemed the Crimson had found a way to claw back into contention, the team was knocked right back to the floor.
I wrote earlier this semester that this year would mark the best chance in a while for coach Pieter Lehrer and his squad to clinch an Ivy title and claim a spot in the NCAA tournament. But if there’s any team that can prove me wrong, it’s Lehrer’s.
Despite losing a core component of its squad to the graduation in 2016, Harvard will have plenty to rebuild with.
Ashby plans to return after taking a medical redshirt to preserve his eligibility, key juniors such as co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu and center back Alex Leondis will return for their final season, the underclassmen will have one more year of experience under their belts, and another quality recruiting class will arrive in Cambridge.
It is tough to say if this will be enough  for the Crimson, but one thing is clear: while it may appear Harvard is down for the count, that is likely not the case.
Lehrer is going to will his team to absorb this latest punch like it has all the rest and come back for the next round, just like it has every season since he arrived in Cambridge three years ago.
Nine months remain before the start of round four, as the Crimson will continue the fight for both the Ancient Eight crown and an NCAA tournament bid under Lehrer.
A lot can happen in that time frame, but there is one thing you can bet on: come next fall, the Harvard men’s soccer team will be back up, ready to fight once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Thanksgiving food coma did not seem to affect the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) as it traveled to Hanover, N.H. on Tuesday to face off against No. 10 Dartmouth (0-1, 0-1). The team, coming off a strong performance in a win against Stanford and a long weekend of rest, did not slow down and brought energy to the Berry Sports Center.
This was the team’s first away game of the season, and to make up for the fans who were unable to make the trek up to New Hampshire, the men’s and women’s teams stayed together to cheer each other on. Just like it did against Stanford a little over a week ago, the Crimson went into the game relaxed and confident, after having spent time working on the mental aspect of its game.
“We’ve been focusing on the mental part of the game, which will become more and more important as the season progresses and we match up against some of our toughest opponents,” junior Dileas MacGowan said. “We do visualization exercises with our coach as part of our training, which we can apply to all matches as [it] helps to ensure consistency and ‘fight’ throughout a match.”
Like it did against Stanford, the team extended its win streak on Tuesday, claiming its eleventh straight victory with another strong showing on the courts. The team, which has a history of performing well against Dartmouth, lived up to expectations in posting a 9-0 sweep, with some returning players getting to play for the first time this season and two freshmen becoming regulars in the Harvard lineup.
“I think they get more confident every match and definitely get to manage their temperament a little bit more, and really understand the pressure of colege squash a little bit better,” co-captain Saumya Karki said.
The top six positions set the tone for the day, with each Crimson player sweeping her opponent.
Freshman Kayley Leonard made another appearance for the Crimson at the No. 1 spot, this time against Jacqueline Barnes, whom she easily handled. Sophomore Alyssa Mehta defeated Victoria Dewey at the No. 2 position, and senior Michelle Gemmell rounded out the top three positions, making quick work of her match against Rebecca Brownell. Leonard, Mehta, and Gemmell all gave up fewer than six points in each of their games.
The second flight also swept its opponents. MacGowan took on Lydie McKenzie at No. 4. Mehta’s younger sister, freshman Sophie, also made an appearance, playing and winning against Zainab Molani at the No. 5 position. Karki, in the No. 6 position, defeated Emma Roberts.
Only in the last two positions did the Crimson give up games to Dartmouth. Junior Caroline Monrad, who played in the No. 7 position, and classmate Keegan Mendez, who played in the eighth, both faltered and lost one game each to Madeline Fraser and Janel Gaube, respectively, but bounced back to ultimately win their matches, 3-1.
With the win, the Crimson hands the Big Green its first loss of the season, and improves its record in its series to 46-3. The team also moves one game closer to another national title—and to make it, Harvard not only has to be physically strong, but mentally ready for the ups and downs of the season.
“One quote from Michael Jordan that our coach reminds us of is the importance of ‘staying the same’,” MacGowan added. “When we’re playing in the finals of a national title and it’s 4-4 in matches, all you need to do is stay the same. You don’t need to perform higher than you have all year—you just need to stay the same. And that quote really helps diminish pressure when we’re in such tough matches. I say it in my head all the time. The mental game is huge in this individual sport.”
