After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As of this moment, there is some reason to worry about how Warner Bros. handles its DC comic book properties. The company’s recent endeavors, such as “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” and “Suicide Squad,” have been plagued by issues ranging from inconsistent and overly grim tones to underdeveloped characters. Luckily, however,  “The Lego Batman Movie,” the new film based on DC Comics characters, comes as a timely upturn. With a sharp script, wickedly fast pacing, and a surprisingly deep and personal story, this spinoff to 2014’s “The Lego Movie” is a universally fun ride.
The story begins with Batman once again saving Gotham City from a terrorist attack by the Joker. It is in this thrilling action scene that an interesting conflict is set up: Joker believes that he is Batman’s greatest villain, but is hurt when Batman denies that the two of them have a codependent relationship. This sets into motion a story that tackles familiar yet essential questions that have pervaded many comic books, films, and video games in Batman’s 78-year-history. Why does Batman work alone? Why is he afraid to have friends and loved ones in his life? Are Batman and Joker merely two sides of the same coin? The film explores these themes to a great extent, digging deep into the characters of both Batman and Joker and developing them carefully.
What makes “The Lego Batman Movie” feel fresh is that it shines a very unique light on these familiar ideas. Whereas many previous Batman films have chosen to explore such concepts in a more serious manner, “Lego Batman” chooses to view them from a comedic perspective. In fact, this overall comedic tone is the film’s best trait. With the same self-referential, satirical humor as its predecessor, the film is filled with hysterical jokes nearly every minute poke fun at everything from studio executives to Donald Trump’s tax returns.
Unfortunately, this is also one of the film’s weaknesses. At times, the jokes come so quickly that there is almost no room to breathe—laughing too hard at one joke can cause the audience to miss the next one. One can’t help but wonder if this is a product of having five screenwriters, perhaps each contributing their own set of jokes that occasionally clash with each other. The tones are also similarly inconsistent. The film varies in mood from scene to scene, going from comedy to drama and back to comedy, and slightly jarring transitions sometimes cause these tones to not quite gel together.
As always, Will Arnett is perfect not just as Batman, but also as a hilarious spoof of Christian Bale’s Dark Knight. Newcomers like Zach Galifianakis as the Joker and Ralph Fiennes as Alfred, Batman’s butler, are welcome additions as well, but the real standout here is Robin, voiced by Michael Cera with suitably youthful energy.
The film’s animation is unsurprisingly gorgeous, with the 2014 film’s animation co-director and editor Chris McKay returning, but this time as director. Colors are bright, models are sharp, and animations are fluid yet realistic. In addition, the film features a couple of catchy and noteworthy pieces of music. Even though “Everything is Awesome,” the standout song from the previous film, is nowhere to be found, Batman rapping about why he’s awesome is a perfectly fine substitute. All of the technical aspects of the film are excellent, creating an immersive visual and auditory experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, Friday night’s game against Columbia was a bit of deja vu to the last time his team faced the Lions. Only this time around, his team was on the winning side of the equation.
After building an 18-point first half lead, the Crimson saw Columbia claw back and eventually take a one-point advantage with 3:12 remaining in the second frame. Though Harvard bent, it didn’t break, and the team eventually escaped with a 78-72 victory.
When Harvard (15-7, 7-2 Ivy League) travelled to New York to face Columbia (10-12, 4-5) on Jan. 28, it experienced a near opposite experience. After going to the locker room down 15 at the break, the visitors pulled back within two before eventually falling, 65-62.
“They’re a very dangerous team and they beat us at their place and played really well, and we came back on them,” Amaker said. “It was a very similar kind of game to be very honest. They held on at the end [at Columbia] and we held on today.”
The Lions hushed the crowd at Lavietes Pavilion when freshman guard Mike Smith scored a fastbreak layup after stealing an errant pass from senior co-captain Corbin Miller. The bucket capped an 8-0 run and put Columbia up 70-69, its first and only lead of the game.
But Miller didn’t let the turnover best him. Instead, he capitalized on his team’s next trip down the floor and sunk an open three to give Harvard a lead it would not relinquish.
“Obviously he was disappointed in that play after making the turnover, but having the toughness and the guts to step back up, have the open shot and bury it—what a lift for our team in a moment,” Amaker said. “But as a senior you would expect plays like that.”
Up 72-70 with 2:42 to go, Columbia would not hit another shot until Smith sunk a layup with 14 ticks on the clock. In the meantime, the Crimson rebuilt an eight-point margin off of perfect free throw shooting by sophomore forward Weisner Perez, senior co-captain Siyani Chambers, and freshman guard Bryce Aiken.
Before the Lions put themselves back in a position to contend for the win, Harvard came out of the gates hot. By the first media timeout, the home squad was up 12-4 off of 5-of-6 shooting. The lead would eventually reach 18 and the Crimson shot a blistering 58 percent in the first half. Unlike most games however, most of the shots came off of jumpers inside the three point line, rather than the team’s tendency to thrive beyond the arc. Harvard was missing sophomore Corey Johnson, the team’s best three-point shooter, to an illness on Friday.
A slow start to the second half allowed Columbia to slowly fight back. A foul by freshman forward Chris Lewis put the Lions on the line on their first offensive possession, and by the first media timeout the lead had been cut to 10. The teams traded baskets for much of the middle portion of the half before Harvard began to see its lead dip lower and lower.
“We honed in on the scouting report before this so we knew what was coming,” freshman forward Seth Towns—the game’s leading scorer with 20 points—said. “Fatigue set in, we had a lot of mental lapses. Credit to them, they’re a really good team, but we just let the fight down. That’s what happened, so we can’t let that happen again.”
Amaker chalked some of his team’s struggles up to youth, noting that the young players can sometimes play in a “fog” in the span of a 40-minute game, he relishes in the opportunity to teach through winning rather than battling the emotions of a loss while trying to overcome areas of weakness. Notably, Aiken struggled on Friday night. After scoring 23 and 27 points last weekend against Brown and Yale, respectively, Aiken tallied five turnovers and shot just 3-for-11 from the floor against the Lions.
“[It’s] typical of young players,” Amaker said. “They can be sensational one game or one weekend and they can look like freshman the next game and that’s what we’re dealing with with young players.”
Though they showed their youth at times, Amaker showed faith in his freshman as he started four rookies, with Chambers being the only non-freshman on the floor at tip-off. Chambers finished the game just shy of a double-double with 13 points and eight assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 18, 2017 at 11:05 a.m.
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — Monday night, the Harvard men's hockey team captured a trophy it hadn't held in 24 years. Friday night, the Crimson clinched one it hadn't controlled in 11.
Netting four goals against Yale for the first time in its last 17 tries, No. 3 Harvard finally reversed its regular-season woes at the Whale, securing the outright Ivy League championship for the first time since 2006 with a 4-2 victory over the Bulldogs.
“I think our guys were understanding of the fact that if we could win tonight, we could win the Ivy League title outright,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think that means a lot to our group. It was one of the goals they set early in the season.”
Just a year ago, the Crimson made its annual trip to Ingalls Rink staring down the same set of circumstances, needing one point to secure sole possession of the league crown. But Harvard came up short, and following a tie in its final Ivy League contest, the Crimson was forced to share the title with its New Haven nemesis.
That Yale team finished 19-9-4 and cracked its sixth NCAA tournament in eight years. This year’s Bulldogs, on the other hand, could be on their way to their first losing season in a decade. And against this struggling squad, Harvard—now a winner of seven straight games—did not waste a second chance at a championship all for itself.
In front of a capacity crowd of 3,500 on the first night of the Yale icemen’s Alumni Weekend, the Crimson (19-5-2, 13-4-2 ECAC) secured its first regular-season victory at the Whale since January 2005. Harvard mustered a season-low of only 20 shots, 26 fewer than it registered in Monday's Beanpot championship where the Crimson was faster and more crisp, according to Donato. But even on an offensive off-night, Donato's squad led practically from start to finish.
Fresh off a two-assist night against Boston University, senior forward Tyler Moy netted his 13th and 14th goals of the season, beginning with Harvard’s first score less than eight minutes in off a feed from classmate Sean Malone behind the net.
The hosts earned an opportunity to pull even on the power play early in the second period, but the Crimson’s penalty-killers had other ideas. With the Bulldogs (10-11-5, 6-9-4) in formation inside the Harvard zone, junior Jake Horton blocked a Henry Hart point shot and knocked the defenseman off the puck, allowing senior Luke Esposito to push forward and eat clock while the Crimson completed a change.
But realizing he had only one man to beat, Esposito turned on the jets along the right boards upon entering the offensive zone. Circling around Yale senior Frankie DiChiara, the senior drifted towards the cage at full speed and netted Harvard’s 10th shorthanded goal of the season right above the crease.
Thanks to Esposito’s goal and a perfect 6-for-6 performance by the penalty kill, the Crimson finished plus-one shorthanded despite playing down a man for 12 minutes. The six-kill result is tied for Harvard’s best statistical showing of the year, and the Crimson is now 13-for-14 over its last three games against quality competition—No. 7 Union, No. 4 Boston University, and now an Ivy League rival.
“I thought our penalty kill was excellent,” Donato said. “It’s the time of year where special teams is important. Trust me, I wish we only had to kill two penalties and not six, but that’s a story for another day.”
On the other end of the special teams battle, Harvard scored twice on the power play for the second game in a row. After the Bulldogs’ Chris Izmirlian and Billy Sweezey took penalties just 32 seconds apart in the back half of the second period, Harvard opened up a 3-0 lead at 15:23 courtesy of its third 5-on-3 conversion of the week.
Senior defenseman Clay Anderson kickstarted the chance, blasting a shot from the top of the slot that hit the end boards and bounced to the bottom of the left circle. There to punch in the rebound was freshman blue-liner John Marino, a former Yale commit, who drew no shortage of boos from the Whale faithful for a celebratory leap into the glass following his first goal since October.
“A win here is just that extra special,” Marino said. “Each time you come here, it’s a battle. It’s always packed, [this] Harvard-Yale rivalry. You’re going to get that every time.”
The Bulldogs remained in contention by grabbing two goals over the final 25 minutes of action. Sophomore Andrew Gaus ripped a powerful shorthanded wrister past Crimson goaltender Merrick Madsen (21 saves) about a minute after Marino’s conversion, and captain John Hayden scored from the slot with 9:47 remaining in regulation. But a Yale miscue sandwiched between the two scores prohibited the Bulldogs from ever pulling back within one.
With the Bulldogs trailing 3-1 early in the third period, Sweezey let go of a standard clear attempt from his own zone, only to hit Moy in the arm with the puck. Suddenly with endless time and space to work on Yale goaltender Patrick Spano, Moy got the netminder to bite on a head fake, ripping home his second goal of the night and allowing Harvard to get comfortable in the game’s final frame.
With the Ivy League title now in hand, the next trophy on the Crimson’s radar is the Cleary Cup, which is awarded to the ECAC’s regular-season champion. Despite riding a nine-game unbeaten streak, Harvard still remains one point behind Union for the top spot in the conference. But three conference games still remain.
“So far, two trophies is awesome,” Marino said. “But we’re definitely not done yet. Not even close.”
GAME NOTES
—While leading 2-0, Harvard appeared to punch in a second shorthanded goal midway through the second period. Thinking pass-first despite staring down an open shooting lane near the slot, Clay Anderson fed a pass to Alexander Kerfoot on his left, and the co-captain discovered twine. However, sophomore Ryan Donato made contact with goaltender Patrick Spano in the crease, which prompted the officials to wave off the goal after a review. Yale's Charlie Curti knocked Donato into Spano, but in accordance with college rules, incidental contact can still produce goalie interference if the netminder is inside his crease and his ability to defend the goal is impacted. And that's what the officials determined had happened.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A red hot shooting start allowed the Harvard men’s basketball team to jump out to a 30-12 lead over Columbia on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The Lions roared back after the intermission, taking a one-point lead with 3:12 to go. However, a late 9-2 run allowed the Crimson to eke out a 78-72 win and avenge a three-point road loss to the Light Blue.
Forwards Chris Lewis and Zena Edosomwan both found themselves in foul trouble on a night when sophomore sharpshooter Corey Johnson was sidelined with an illness. While the hosts did concede 14 offensive rebounds, the trio of co-captain Siyani Chambers, freshman Bryce Aiken, and fellow first-year Seth Towns provided the big shots that the Crimson (15-7, 7-2 Ivy League) needed to come out on top. Columbia (10-12, 4-5) was paced by freshman guard Mike Smith, who contributed 14 points despite being held to 6-of-19 shooting.
FRESH START
Harvard had trailed at halftime in seven of its first eight Ivy League games entering Friday, but you would never know it given the clinic that the Crimson put on during the game’s opening minutes. Columbia coach Jim Engles had his team come out in zone to begin the contest, a logical response to an abysmal shooting performance from Harvard when the teams met in New York three weekends ago. The Crimson made its first six shots—all of them two-point field goals—to jump out to a 12-4 edge before the game’s first media timeout.
“We had a terrific start and I thought our kids were ready to play,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We shot it well early and I thought that gave them a lot of energy and excitement.”
The Crimson made seven of its 27 field goal attempts in the first half of the teams’ first meeting. Harvard’s seventh field goal on Friday came on its eight shot attempt of the evening—with 15:46 still to play before intermission.
While the Crimson did cool off, it steamrolled into halftime with a 46-30 lead despite only making two three-pointers before the break. The 46 points were the most by Harvard in an Ivy League contest this season and the 16-point lead was the Crimson’s largest halftime lead since December.
Harvard shot 58 percent from the field in the frame and saw nine different players register at least one field goal. It was by far the best start that the Crimson has had in an Ivy League game this season and was quite a change of pace for a team that has had to overcome double-digit deficits in four Ivy League wins this season.
“We really tried to focus on getting off to a better start this game because we’ve been lacking in that department,” Chambers said. “We’re really just trying to stick to our rules and just on offense move the ball and have player movement and really try to find the open man and let the shot come to you.”

CHICAGO BULL
Sophomore forward Weisner Perez was a secret weapon on Harvard’s team from a season ago. The 6’6” Quincy resident may not have the size of a typical college power forward but his shooting range and strength made him an ideal fit for Amaker against teams utilizing smaller lineups. Perez’s star grew after he dropped 15 points in a nationally televised road game against Kansas during December of his freshman year, but the native of Berwyn, Ill., a town 11 miles west of Chicago, struggled to find his way into Amaker’s rotation during his second year in Cambridge—he logged just eight minutes in the team’s 13 nonconference tilts. Since Ivy League play has commenced, however, Perez has spent much less time on the pine and more time in big spots for his team.
“He put together some practices that were just terrific,” Amaker said. “I think that sends the right message to our team, guys keep competing and get after it.  It’s been rewarded and he’s been able to produce.”
After playing 10 minutes in each of last weekend’s matchups, Perez logged 13 minutes against the Lions. While he only converted one field goal, he hit five free throws, recorded six rebounds (including two on the offensive end), and teamed up with the 6’7” Towns down the stretch to neutralize the Columbia potent senior front line of 6’8” Jeff Coby and 6’10” Luke Petracek.
Perez and Towns combined to corral the game’s final three rebounds for Harvard and the former’s two free throws made it a two-possession game, something it would stay the rest of the way. Despite Lewis and Edosomwan combining for just 30 minutes and eight fouls, the Lions’ starting front court went just 5-of-18 from the field on the evening. Perez, recruited as a small forward out of high school, proved he could hang with the big boys on Friday.
“Everybody gets reps with everybody in practice,” Towns said. “I’m comfortable playing with him, he’s a bull, he’s a hard worker, so it’s easy playing with a guy like him. Credit to him, he was huge for us tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — The Harvard men’s hockey team spoiled the mood in Ingalls Rink on Friday night, as the Crimson’s 4-2 victory hushed a loud and emotional crowd here to celebrate Yale’s Alumni and Senior Weekend. A slew of penalties and net-front collisions escalated things early in the second period, warranting scuffles and animosity after almost every whistle until the final horn.
With the win, Harvard (19-5-2, 13-4-2 ECAC) improved upon its NCAA-best win percentage, advancing to .769 at the Bulldogs’ (10-11-5, 6-9-4) expense. This marks the seventh straight win for the Crimson and its ninth consecutive match without a loss.
BACK ON TOP
In the past five days, the Harvard men’s hockey team has reacquainted itself with a few long-sought titles. After bringing home its first Beanpot championship in 24 years on Monday, the Crimson clinched the outright Ivy League crown on Friday, a feat last accomplished in the 2005-2006 season.
“It’s obviously been really great to be rewarded for a lot of hard work that goes beyond the start of the season,” senior forward Tyler Moy said. “We want to be a championship team, and to be able to close out those important games is huge for us.”
Despite the Ivy League not officially recognizing a ‘conference’ champion until the 1956-1957 season, Harvard sits atop its league for the 23rd time in program history and the third time in Donato’s tenure as coach. The Crimson did enjoy an Ivy championship last season but reluctantly shared it with Yale after the Bulldogs emerged victorious from the two sides’ annual meeting at Ingalls Rink and won out the rest of the way.
Friday night’s clinching victory marks the first back-to-back titles for Harvard since 1993-1994. The team, while relishing the accomplishment, turns its focus to future games—ones that carry ECAC and NCAA implications.
“This has been a very focused group,” Donato noted. “The senior leadership has been outstanding and I think they had the group really dialed in…. We’re happy to be able to leave here with our two points.”
Donato, the only Harvard bench boss to appear in the NCAA tournament in both of his first two campaigns, won his first Ivy title in just his second year at the helm of the Crimson.
“So far, two trophies are awesome, but we’re definitely not done yet, not even close,” acknowledged freshman blue-liner John Marino, whose goal against the Bulldogs was especially sweet since he was originally set to play hockey at Yale before recommitting to Harvard.
THE BIG SHORTIES
With 14:33 remaining in the second period, a shorthanded goal courtesy of senior forward Luke Esposito gave the Crimson a two-goal lead and, in the process, sole possession of the NCAA lead in man-down tallies. Harvard now sets the pace for all Division I schools with 10 shorthanded strikes and far exceeds Yale’s mark of one on the year.
“I thought our penalty kill was excellent. I thought our defensemen in particular were very good,” Donato said. “We played with a lot of energy on the penalty kill, blocked some shots when we needed to…. It’s the time of year when special teams are really important.”
The Crimson scored in all scenarios on Friday night, bulging twine at even strength, on the power play, and while killing a penalty. Sophomore forward Ryan Donato leads his team with three goals while outnumbered, with five more Harvard forwards joining the shorty club this season. Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot almost celebrated his second man-down snipe of the year before his goal at the 10:22 mark of the middle frame was waved off for goalie interference.
“We’ve been trying to pressure down the ice when we can,” Ted Donato acknowledged. “We’re trying to force teams into making mistakes instead of sitting back and letting them dictate the play.”
Friday’s showdown marked the third game this month in which the Crimson has capitalized on the opposition’s lackadaisical power-play performance. Junior forward Jake Horton and Esposito, a repeat offender, did the damage in these contests.
“When we get [the puck], guys are trying to make plays,” said Ted Donato, praising his team’s effort and killer instinct shorthanded. “We have some guys who can get around the ice.”
As if a goal—almost a pair of goals—wasn’t enough, the Harvard penalty kill unit remained perfect on the night, stifling all six of the Bulldogs’ extra-man opportunities. Despite Yale’s dry spell on the power play, the Bulldogs, like their rival Crimson, did find the back of the net while shorthanded, thanks to a superlative snipe from sophomore forward Andrew Gaus.
THE WHITE WHALE
The last time Harvard stole a regular-season victory from Yale at Ingalls Rink, famously nicknamed “The Whale,” was January of 2005. Harvard had just two overall wins in New Haven since that victory 12 seasons ago in Donato’s first year as bench boss, with both coming in the 2015 campaign to clinch a best-of-three ECAC quarterfinal series for the Crimson.
“Every year is a new year,” Moy remarked. “I think our team was prepared coming into this, and we know [the Whale] is a tough place to play in with the fans and everything, but I don’t think we had any doubt in our minds coming in.”
These two historic rivals first met on the ice in New York City in 1900. This inaugural clash ended with Yale celebrating, but since then, the 253 matchups in eight different cities have been kinder to the Crimson. After Friday night’s win, the series record now favors Harvard by a tally of 143-90-21.
“[The Bulldogs] are really tough here, especially against us,” Donato admitted. “They just don’t give you much, and they really test your willingness…to take chances.”
Now having broken an ugly streak of 11 straight winless regular-season appearances at the Whale, the Crimson will have a chance to start a streak of its own next season. With the ECAC tournament approaching, however, the possibility of another Harvard-Yale clash this season still remains. But if the two sides were to meet in March, it wouldn’t be in New Haven.
