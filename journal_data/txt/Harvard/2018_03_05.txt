After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not content with Harvard’s policy on unrecognized single-gender social groups, some alumni have begun to look for a way to protect their old clubs. Rather worryingly, they have begun to lobby Congress to alter the proposed PROSPER Act such that it would apply to the College. Under the proposed legislation, universities to which the law currently would apply  are  prohibited from taking punitive measures against students who opt to join single-gender groups.
While we stand by our support for the College's sanctions on final clubs and Greek organizations, we believe that regardless of one’s stance on the issue, these alumni have behaved inappropriately. Any policy, or lack of policy, on Harvard's single-gender social organizations should be decided by those who have a direct and immediate connection to Harvard—current students, faculty, and administrators. Some alumni on these club graduate boards have not attended Harvard in decades, and yet are still trying to enshrine a lifestyle they led when the College was a vastly different institution.
Alumni who are concerned with the state of Harvard today could do more tangible good for the student body by wielding their influence for something other than these bastions of exclusivity. They could donate to financial aid initiatives, start new summer internship programs, or invest in Harvard’s research.
Instead, their actions carry a degree of hypocrisy. Many of these alumni are currently lobbying Congress because they believe the Corporation has overstepped its boundaries in effectively codifying the College's penalties. However, to go to the U.S. government, in an attempt to supersede the Corporation, is an even more egregious form of the alleged overreach they decry.
We are disappointed in the decision by these alumni to use their money and influence in an attempt to lobby the federal government to overrule a policy specific to a single university. The debate over final clubs and Greek organizations is entirely a Harvard-specific issue to resolve, and should not be subject to the will of any other institution. We urge the College to ignore these efforts and continue to assert its rightful authority to decide what works on its own campus.
Ultimately, whether these lobbying efforts continue or fizzle out, we do acknowledge that the entire process of implementing the sanctions has been incredibly confusing. The student body needs clarity on the sanctions, especially as the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences will soon vote on whether to include the policy in the Student Handbook. This policy has already begun to affect students on this campus. Yet the lack of clarity on the sanctions does not excuse the actions of overzealous and overstepping alumni. This backdoor attempt by far-removed alumni to change the policy through the labyrinthine mechanisms of the federal government will only add to this needless confusion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture this past November, University President Drew G. Faust argued that education is the civil rights issue of our time. Drawing inspiration from Frederick Douglass’s insistence on the importance of education as resistance to slavery, President Faust wrote in Harvard Magazine, “Education liberates the mind, even when the body is oppressed. It gives us perspective as a passport to other times, other places, and other points of view, as well as a way to learn about ourselves and to re-imagine our lives in ways that alter us forever.” As racial oppression in the United States persisted but changed forms, education continued to be a key frontier, with Brown v. Board of Education marking the first major victory against Jim Crow. Today, as policing and mass incarceration have become central to institutional racism, education remains a powerful means of resistance. If Harvard is serious about education as a civil right, it is time to start offering College courses in Massachusetts prisons.
In September, following the revelation that Harvard administrators had likely overturned the admission of Michelle Jones to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences due to her formerly incarcerated status, 171 faculty signed onto a letter titled “We Are Educators, Not Prosecutors.” The signatories called on Harvard to add criminal history to Harvard’s non-discrimination policy and to support Harvard faculty interest in creating a prison education program. From March 5 to 7, the Beyond the Gates conference will propose how to actualize this demand. Students who graduated from higher education in prison programs, including Jones, and educators who have helped develop these programs will come together to discuss models of prison education and propose bringing together the best features of each to create a new, innovative program at Harvard. It is crucial that Harvard does not let this opportunity for action pass by.
Harvard currently lags behind its peers in offering courses in prison, though it has historically been a leader. Graduate student researchers working on a report to be released at the conference have discovered in the Harvard Archives that as early as 1833, Divinity School students were entering prisons to offer religious education. In the 1920s, Howard B. Gill, Class of 1913, designed Norfolk Prison Colony as a “community prison,” complete with buildings arranged like a college campus, a community center, dormitories around a quadrangle, and a well-stocked library. It was through Norfolk’s debate team that Malcolm Little became the powerful public speaker Malcolm X. In the 1950s, the Phillips Brooks House Association began to send Harvard students to teach alongside incarcerated men and women. Today, the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform, a part of PBHA, continues this work, tutoring men and women at six local correctional facilities in life skills and GED preparation. But at many other universities—including Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Cornell—prison education has moved beyond undergraduate volunteering. At these institutions, faculty teach accredited college courses in prisons.
Harvard had such a program, the Prison Studies Project, led by Graduate School of Education lecturer Kaia Stern and Professor of Sociology Bruce Western. From 2008 to 2013, Harvard and Boston University students shared a classroom with incarcerated men and women enrolled in Boston University’s Prison Education Program for a semester-long seminar that explored topics in urban sociology, such as race, poverty, and community justice, inside the walls of local prisons, for which both Harvard and Boston University students received course credit. However, since funding dried up for this initiative, these courses are no longer offered.
Harvard has an opportunity to become a leader in the field of prison education once again, by directing its resources towards new models of prison education which offer accredited courses for incarcerated and campus-based students together. Offering mixed-classroom courses combats the isolation of incarceration. In a society like ours, where gates keep people out and bars keep people in, the classroom is a place of solidarity and community. Creating communities of learners, rather than isolating people into categories of “students” and the “incarcerated,” has ramifications outside of the classroom, too: It provides social networks which can help incarcerated students upon re-entry. It facilitates intergenerational conversations between students of different ages. And it ensures that all students think and learn in ways that keep them engaged with the world. Prison education empowers people who have been systematically denied access to education. It gives tools for change to those who know the injustice of the criminal justice system best. As Marcus Williams of the prison education program Liberation Literacy writes, “Education teaches us how to resist and organize. Politicizing someone’s mind is a non-violent form of resistance.” A mixed-classroom prison education program would enable Harvard campus students to come together with incarcerated students and develop the language, skills, and community necessary to resist and organize against systemic oppression. It would be a concrete step towards Harvard’s goal of providing education that benefits society.
As students, we call upon Harvard to begin offering courses in prison, both because we believe it would help us become more engaged learners and because we believe Harvard has an ethical duty to the community around it. Accordingly, HOPE is holding a rally outside University Hall on Tuesday to demonstrate student support for prison education at Harvard. The rally has been cosponsored by the Black Students Association, Association of Black Harvard Women, Student Labor Action Movement, and more student organizations.
Prisons deny people the chance at the personal and political growth that Harvard rightly views as a civil right. If Harvard is serious about its responsibility to members of its internal community, and about acknowledging its role in the larger communities it occupies, it must put its immense resources towards engaging with the incarcerated population around it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To philosophize about redistributive justice is a college student’s rite of passage into academic delirium. This practice is corroborated by literature that veers toward verbosity (John Rawls’s “A Theory of Justice”), proselytization (Mark Greif’s “Gut Level Legislation, or, Redistribution”), and anecdotes (Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations”) created by philosophers, journalists, and essayists alike. Though devoid of most practical assessment, the question encompasses an important subject: What reward should we receive for the act of living? For this question, we must think globally.
This argument for redistributive justice is difficult because our economic language places itself around collective growth, not morality. Growth is a meaningful goal, serving as the drawing factor of capitalism. Challenges to growth are deemed inefficiencies. This framework, of course, does not allow political identities to rest on level ground. Liberals stand in an awkward position of arguing precisely the way our world in its current position reeks of inefficiency. In liberal-generated economics, hiring discrimination limits the free sorting that the labor market’s autonomy necessitates; immigration bans actively create bureaucratic stress and interrupt flow of labor in the economy. As America’s economic and social foundations rest on capitalism and democracy respectively, both working ideally to maximize freedom, the two ideologies are inextricably connected in an American mind. Insistence on redistribution—by any means and of any object—is antithetical to the capitalist position that our own choices are sustainable. Its implication of regulation reject the democratic lemma that our individualism is socially beneficial.
Thomas Piketty in his book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” challenges the ideological harmony between capitalism and democracy specific to American thought. There are few academic books of such casual placement in personal libraries, indie bookstores, and millennial conversation. Its popularity rests in its presentation of a palatable case for redistribution. The thesis is simple—our investment structures force returns on capital to greatly exceed economic growth, thus privileging elites. This entrenchment results in the inevitable formation of an oligarchy whose rigidity displeases Americans not yet disillusioned with the concept of mobility as a possibility. The mechanism of oligarchy to political unrest is that extreme stability lends itself to instability. What Piketty describes as the driving force for such transition may be a corollary to a rudimentary art history axiom: A genre’s self-consciousness is its demise.
To many, a possible threat to democracy is enough to challenge the inequality that economic theory states is a necessary sacrifice for growth. Though Piketty argues for a global redistributive tax, does this investment in freedom extend across national lines? The government acts as a centralized body for domestic redistribution, deeming its practices plausible. But on the international plane, there are no rules. One acts in accordance to one’s contemporaries; the rules change when they are no longer optimal.
There are myriad factors preventing policy production of such scope, including issues of compliance, fragility of international organization, and narrativization of patriotism. The closest example of an attempt would be the financial collectivism of the European Union, whose institutions even Piketty in his article “Our manifesto for Europe” published in The Guardian states are “dysfunctional and need to be rebuilt.” The European Union is not yet a failure but seems to produce divisions opposite to its initial vision of inclusion, peace, and collaboration. French president Emmanuel Macron passed an elite-favoring tax plan nearly identical to that of Trump; anti-immigrant populist movements gain traction in Austria, Italy, and Germany. Indeed, there would be no worse American nightmare than to share financial structures with others, trading our relatively speedy recovery from recession with a debt crisis. The European experiment, for all its controversy, is notably not prescriptive but structural. It requires the sharing of financial institutions and subsequent implications, not the intentional relocation of property, wealth, or investment. To institute a continental redistributive tax would be a social disaster that spikes nationalism, isolationism, and nativism. Thus, dreaming of income redistribution without the normalization of immigration, or the redistribution of people, is meaningless, especially as rates of such exchange rise.
The world is not very good at either population or wealth redistribution, let alone the two together. What surprises me most about conversations on immigration is its inaccuracy. In the United Kingdom, the average Brit estimates the population’s foreign-born proportion at 31 percent, nearly double that of the actual statistic. A study of refugees in Uganda suggested that contrary to political representations in host societies of refugees as burdens, refugees acted as consumers, employment-creators, and generators of human capital. Immigration generally does not yield significant impacts on unemployment in host societies. The question of domestic redistributive justice, however, challenges benign academic characterizations of immigration. Immigration does not benefit us all equally. Studies have also shown shifts in domestic wage distributions after immigration waves, favoring those at the top and harming those at the bottom. Irrational nationalistic instances further complicate the conversation surrounding immigration. Is the global redistribution of people a challenge to our fantasies of wealth redistribution? As populism may be the biggest symptom of democracy, do current trends suggest that in real life, immigration counters such visions of domestic wealth redistributions? Is our duty a global or national one? These questions are not to say that domestic and global equality are in contention, as there are countless determinants for both. I am simply saying that they are connected, that a fear of immigration from our lowest echelons is all logical, worrisome, and threatening precisely because it did not arise from thin air.
To lean on pretty odes to wealth redistribution and immigration as a proxy of political favorability is intentionally myopic, as we do not live in ideal versions of the world. If our primary goal is inclusion and equality of opportunity, the solution to this paradox is to be less reactionary as a society and to provide financial, educational, and social support for those most vulnerable. We can indeed be both less nativist and elitist. But this statement is overly positive. We must first identify the contradictions of our society to rectify them. Through such conversations, America can fulfill both a redistributive duty to her own people and the international community from which she derives her status.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-sexual assault group Our Harvard Can Do Better endorsed Harvard’s graduate student unionization movement Thursday, arguing allowing students to collectively bargain would mean better support for those who suffer sexual harassment.
The endorsement comes ahead of a fast-approaching second unionization election—slated to be held April 18 and 19—that will determine whether eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants, as well as graduate research assistants, may form a union to negotiate with Harvard.
Though it did not consider endorsing the union ahead of the Nov. 2016 unionization election, Our Harvard Can Do Better called for the University to drop its appeal to the National Labor Relations Board in 2017.  Following the Nov. 2016 vote, the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers engaged in legal proceedings over the validity of that election before the NLRB, which in December 2017 mandated that Harvard hold a second election.
Sarah S. Fellman ’18-’19, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, cited gains made by unions at the University of Michigan and University of Connecticut as proof that a graduate student union could help change how sexual assault cases are handled at Harvard.
“The great thing about HGSU is that it’s a democratic way that student workers can vote to include contract provisions that would structurally support survivors of sexual assault,” Fellman said. “We’re really thinking about ways that students can unite to take back some of that power that perpetrators have over survivors, and that the University has unilaterally over survivors.”
The group decided to endorse HGSU-UAW on Thursday, two days after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 10 women are accusing Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of various acts of sexual harassment over the past 30 years. Fellman said that, while the group had considered endorsing HGSU-UAW before, the allegations against Dominguez added new urgency.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an email to FAS affiliates Monday night that Dominguez would be placed on “administrative leave,” pending review.
“We are encouraged to see the university take seriously the history of sexual harassment perpetrated by Dominguez, and we are reassured that the administration is taking action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our community,” Our Harvard Can Do Better representatives wrote in an emailed statement Sunday. “The problems this case laid bare neither start nor end with Dominguez, and we're looking forward to turning this victory into a call to action to address persistent rape culture, ambient sexism, and problematic power dynamics in the Government Department, Harvard at large, and beyond.”
In response to the Chronicle’s reporting on Dominguez, administrators at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have sent several emails to students pointing them to Title IX resources. GSAS also recently appointed a Title IX coordinator.
Interim Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench sent an email Wednesday to graduate students encouraging them to use GSAS resources and to come forward with allegations.
“I believe it is important to reaffirm GSAS’s commitment to creating an inclusive community free of harassment and discrimination,” Dench wrote. “Every member of our community—students, faculty, and staff—deserves to thrive, and as a consequence, sexual harassment and sexual assault have no place here.”
History graduate student and HGSU-UAW supporter Aaron T. Bekemeyer wrote in an email he is excited that Our Harvard Can Do Better chose to endorse the union.
He also said union members would have access to support from union representatives; neutral, third-party arbiters; and contractual provisions requiring that sexual assault policies and procedures are displayed on campus.
“Collective bargaining allows the survivors to have a say in these policies and procedures, to make sure that their needs are met,” Bekemeyer wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard have developed a new company that aims to give individuals full ownership over their personal genomic data through the use of blockchain technology, which allows for secure storage and easy sharing of encrypted information.
Harvard Medical School Genetics Professor George M. Church, Ph.D. student Dennis Grishin, and former Google Project Manager Kamal Obbad ’16 founded Nebula Genomics. The company hopes to address challenges facing the field of personal genomics, a discipline that maps individuals’ genetic blueprints.
The co-founders say the company’s name reflects the basic premise of blockchain technology, which Obbad described as a “decentralized, trustless database” that “essentially everyone owns.” Information added to the database must be approved by all members.
“‘Nebula,’ as you know, is Latin for ‘fog,’ which is kind of the idea behind blockchain,” Grishin said. “It’s very decentralized, and there’s no central point that controls everything—just a network of independent participants that just interact with each other. And that’s what Nebula is.”
After conducting several consumer surveys and speaking to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the team found a disconnect between data owners and data buyers they say inhibits the exchange of useful genomic data.
“Right now, there are middlemen that exist between actual data owners, like you and me, and the pharma and biotech companies that would like to get access to that data. Those middlemen are pretty much all of the personal genomics companies that exist right now, like 23andMe, Ancestry, and others,” Grishin said. “In the end, their objective is to keep your data and sell your data to those pharma companies. And that’s actually what they’re making their profit with.”
Grishin said the presence of these middlemen introduces several problems. On the one hand, individuals lose ownership and control over their personal data and do not profit when that data is sold to buyers, sometimes for hundreds of dollars per individual.
On the other, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies must go through slow data acquisition processes and are limited in what they can do with the static information they receive, as they cannot ask the data owner additional questions.
Nebula Genomics thus seeks to connect data owners directly with data buyers. Grishin explained that individuals can use the Nebula app to grant a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company of their choice access to their data for research purposes. Nebula will also give individuals more insight into what their genomic data means throughout their lifetimes, expanding the frontiers of genetics research and scientific advancement.
Grishin emphasized user privacy will not be compromised in the process.
“One important aspect in regards to data sharing is that you never actually sell your data, meaning you never really lose ownership of your data, but rather you’re just lending it to those buyers,” Grishin said. “We’re using certain encryption technologies that enable data buyers to just temporarily get access, compute on the data, get some results, but actually never see the input data. After the computation is done, they lose access.”
Another problem with current personal genomics companies is that they only offer genotyping of “a fraction of a percent of the whole genome,” according to Obbad.
“They look at these [alleles] because they already know what they do, so this data is not super valuable to researchers. But what could be really useful to researchers is full genome sequencing or exome sequencing,” he added.
Obbad said Nebula Genomics hopes to address this concern as well.
The team hopes to launch Nebula within the next few months in partnership with a pharmaceutical company that could benefit from their services. In the long term, they plan to grow their database and work closely with third-party apps to discover new uses for genomic data.
“I think for me and Kamal, and certainly for George, our vision is to create something that will fundamentally transform health care and science,” Grishin said. “And blockchain is a tool that we think is very suitable for addressing this challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has placed Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez on “administrative leave” days after The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 10 women are accusing Dominguez of sexual harassment over the past 30 years.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced the decision to put Dominguez on leave in an email sent to FAS affiliates Sunday evening.
“I write to announce that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) has placed Jorge Dominguez on administrative leave, pending a full and fair review of the facts and circumstances regarding allegations that have come to light,” Smith wrote. “I want to state unequivocally that the FAS will not tolerate sexual harassment. I encourage anyone who has witnessed sexual harassment in the FAS, recently or in the past, to come forward and share their experiences with our Title IX coordinators.”
This leave is effective immediately.
Smith wrote in the email that it is “imperative” that Harvard lend support to those who have suffered sexual harassment.
“We will use every means at our disposal to ensure that we create a safe and healthy community in which people can thrive,” Smith wrote.
Dominguez’s lawyer, Leonard H. Kesten, wrote in an email that Dominguez was informed of the decision “a couple hours before” Smith sent out the email.
Since The Chronicle reported on harassment allegations against Dominguez spanning decades last Tuesday, many students have called for Dominguez’s removal.
In an email to Harvard affiliates Friday, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 did not say whether Dominguez would suffer consequences, but affirmed the University’s commitment to  creating a “safe and healthy educational and work environment” and asked Harvard affiliates to come forward if they had experienced sexual harassment or assault.
The email followed a Friday morning meeting held to allow Government concentrators to discuss the allegations and to share their thoughts on gender and harassment issues within the department. At the meeting, students questioned the University’s lack of action on the issue.
“I understand there was only one formal complaint,” Government concentrator Emily E. Bergquist ’18 said at the meeting. “There were several articles in The Crimson. Was the department aware of those? Has the department done anything in response to that?”
The Weatherhead Center, where Dominguez is a a Senior Advisor, also released a statement on Friday in response to the Chronicle article. Center Director Michèle Lamont wrote that the Center is “unambiguously committed to the policy and practice of zero tolerance of sexual harassment or gendered disparity of treatment.” She also encouraged Harvard affiliates to reach out to her, Title IX officers, and other administrators.
“The Weatherhead center leadership continues to respond to this developing situation,” Lamont wrote.
The decision to place Dominguez on leave comes nearly 40 years after he sexually harassed a junior in one of his classes, according to a second article by The Chronicle published Sunday.
Dominguez has suffered consequences for sexual harassment once before. The University first took action against the professor in 1983 when it barred him from administrative duties following multiple reports from former assistant professor Terry Karl and another graduate student that he made sexual advances towards them.
Since the 1983 sanctions, Dominguez has served in multiple high-up administrative positions. He served as director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs from 1995 to 2006 and was Harvard’s first vice provost for International Affairs from 2006 to 2015.
As Dominguez rose through the ranks, he continued to sexually harass over a dozen women, according to The Chronicle. The victims ranged from students at the College to other junior faculty, and the most recent incident reported in The Chronicle took place in 2015.
It is unclear when the University last placed a faculty member on “administrative leave.” Smith did not mention in his email what privileges Dominguez will lose while on leave.
A professor’s position last came under public investigation by an internal FAS committee in 2011, when a committee found psychology professor Marc Hauser guilty of scientific misconduct. Ultimately, Hauser resigned from Harvard.
In addition to Dominguez, two other Government professors were publicly accused of sexual misconduct in the 1980s. In 1985, Government professor Douglas A. Hibbs was forced to resign after sexual harassment accusations.
Government concentrator Elena D. Sokoloski ’18, who started the social media campaign “#DominguezMustGo,” said she was happy to hear that Dominguez had been placed on leave. She said she believes the action indicates the administration is taking the situation “seriously.”
“I'm so happy. I know that it's only the beginning, but it's a really good start,” she said.
Sokoloski added she thinks the administration must continue to address the broader issue of sexual harassment at Harvard.
“This problem isn't just about Dominguez, it's about department-wide culture that allowed this to happen for 40 years,” Sokoloski said. “It's time to get down to work and begin taking steps to make sure this sort of climate is changed, this climate where women don't feel safe coming forward about sexual harassment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 5, 2018 at 3:05 p.m.
Hundreds gathered at the Law School for the fifth annual "Harvard LGBTQ Conference" Friday and Saturday to discuss inclusion, representation, and BGLTQ activism in today’s society.
The conference—titled “Resilience Through Love and Resistance”—drew students from across the College and Harvard’s graduate schools, as well as activists from around the nation. Conference events included panels, a film screening, and even a ‘vogue-ology’ workshop across the weekend.
Travon Free, a comedian and actor who has written for “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee”—and who is currently producing “Him or Her,” a comedy series about the dating life of a bisexual black man—spoke about the issue of representation in his opening keynote address.
Free said that, while he was growing up, he never saw people like him represented in the media.
“I had been looking for so long for an example, a role model,” he said. “And suddenly I realized, ‘Holy shit, it’s me. I’m the example.’ In that moment, I saw the hardship I’d experienced in a whole new light."
“It’s then that I realized these things didn’t happen to me, they happened for me. And I have been walking through darkness, but I can be someone else’s light,” Free added.
In previous years, the conference has been organized entirely by graduate students—though the event itself has always been open to undergraduates—but this year Haley C. Curtin ’18 joined as the first undergraduate organizer in the conference’s history.
The organizing team primarily included students from Harvard Law School, the Graduate School of Education, the Kennedy School, and the Business School.
While Curtin is officially on the operations team, she said she also acted as a “quasi-liaison” to the College. Curtin said she did notice an increase in undergraduate interest, especially on Facebook, following pubbing of the event via various queer student organizations on campus.
“I think it’s really great that College students are becoming more involved,” Curtin said.
“I would hope that overall, it just inspires people to continue to have these conversations and to recognize that in a lot of different fields, there are queer people,” she added. “In a lot of different spaces, there are voices that have stories to tell.”
Arthur Lipkin ’68, a consultant to the Mass. Safe Schools Program for LGBT Students, spoke on reaching the youth in a panel discussing resilience across BGLTQ communities.
Lipkin referenced New York’s Harvey Milk High School, a school specifically designed for BGLTQ youth. Lipkin said he thought the program comprised a good “emergency measure,” though he wants to see more structural changes to curricula in all schools.
“I’m happy to say that,  after 30 years of hoping, we might have some queer content in our curriculum in Massachusetts. We finally have been accepted to post a number of curriculum units in social studies and language arts for high school students,” Lipkin said. “We’re trying to be deliberately intersectional and inclusive and have an impact not just on the kids in the Harvey Milk program.”
The conference also featured a panel entitled “Bridging Communities: Faith-Based Leadership,” which focused on the relationship between religion and sexuality. Panelists discussed their own experiences within their respective religious communities and urged attendees to remain resilient.
“They’re not angry at you. They’re angry at what they fear, and you need to understand what they fear, because otherwise you will never get the conversation going,” Rabbi Steven Greenberg said.
Curtin said she found the religion panel especially relevant because of how much recent attention has been focused on BGLTQ inclusion in religious spaces.
“It’s a really tough one because a lot of different traditions have certain things to say about LGBTQ issues, but that’s not to say we should shy away from those conversations,” Curtin said.
The conference closed with an address from Wash. Supreme Court Justice Mary I. Yu.
Yu spoke about her experiences as the state’s first Asian, Latina, and openly gay justice, as well as her journey to get to that position.
“The very presence of me is political,” she said.
Yu said the visibility of her identity has caused her some self-doubt over the course of her lifetime, but bringing her experiences to the judge’s bench helped change the opinions of others around her.
“I believe being there makes all the difference,” she said. “It wasn’t too long ago that it was also my court when I wasn’t there, that denied us in the state of Washington the right to marry the person that we love.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Race-related activism is re-emerging at Harvard Law School after a group of Law students wore pink armbands and hung posters last month to “stand in solidarity with people of color” following incidents of racism at Stanford Law School in the fall.
The events at Stanford included recruitment letters posted by a white supremacist group and the placement of anti-immigrant mail in a student’s mailbox.
First-year Law student Felipe D. Hernandez, along with 11 other students who chose to remain anonymous, wrote a Feb. 2018  letter published in the Harvard Law Record arguing the Law School also struggles with racism. A photo of Law Students holding a sign spelling out “#RacismLivesHereToo” accompanied the letter.
Hernandez said his co-authors, who he said were mostly first-year Law students, wished to remain anonymous in order to preserve their relationships with administrators.
“People are organizing different things on campus and so they are still developing their relationships with the admin so we’re always careful about releasing anyone’s name tied to any particular event or organizing because that’s how institutions of power have traditionally used that method to identify activists and activism,” Hernandez said.
The group also put up posters around the Law School’s campus, highlighting instances of prejudice they said they had encountered at the school and calling out “‘-isms’ of subordination on campus.” The posters include statements like “My name is continually mispronounced despite correcting people multiple times” and “Classmates have said ‘your English is so good I didn’t know you are an international student.’”
While the campaign was not officially organized by any formal affinity groups, president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association Jazzmin A. Carr praised it in an emailed statement, writing her group “stands in solidarity” with its organizers.
“Our organization remains firmly committed to charging our administration and the greater society to confront the racism, prejudice, discrimination, profiling, victimization, objectification, micro-aggressions, and marginalization that members of our community often face,” she wrote. “This campaign reflects that mission and has emboldened members of our community to speak out and to act. We thank all the organizers and students who bravely shared their experiences, and we will continue to advocate alongside them.”
The Harvard Law Record letter specifically criticized the structure of the financial aid system, the perception that the school is not geared toward public interest, and the first-year curriculum.
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells emphasized the school takes these issues seriously and is working to improve the school’s culture and offerings.
“The student financial services office advisory group is looking at the Loan Income Protection Plan. LIPP is something that is always being looked at,” Sells said in an interview last week, addressing criticisms of the school’s financial aid and public interest programs.
LIPP is a program designed to help Law graduates who enter into public service careers pay back their student loans. Students in the LIPP program pay back a portion of their loans based on their income and LIPP covers the remaining amount. In recent years, Law School affiliates have debated the efficacy of the program and the perception that the Law School pushes students toward corporate law.
Sells also mentioned the school has created 1L reading groups, discussion circles, improved faculty advising, and set aside time for open office hours with the deputy deans.
Sells suggested that the majority of the students involved in the “Racism Lives Here Too” actions are first-year students and may not have been exposed to all of the resources the Law School provides, particularly those geared towards promoting public interest.
“As a first-year student—and this is a student who just finished first semester—there are some things that we aren’t doing in terms of public interest advising right away because it is also about for first-years to study and feel at ease,” Sells said. “There’s lots of opportunities.”
Race-related issues are not new to Harvard Law School; two years ago, the school saw a wave of activism after an incident in which black tape was placed over the portraits of black law professors. Reclaim Harvard Law—the activist movement that emerged in the wake of the incident—occupied a student lounge for weeks, calling on administrators to create a more welcoming environment for minority students and faculty.
The school made took several steps in the spring of 2016 to address concerns about diversity and inclusivity on its campus, including removing the Law School’s seal, which bore the crest of a slave-owning family.
The Reclaim movement died down by fall 2016, but students and administrators say they are still thinking about diversity and inclusion at the Law School.
“Universities, I think, higher ed, are looking at the issues of belong, inclusion, at large and Harvard University and Harvard Law School is no different,” Sells said. “It did not just begin just this year, I think it’s, for most of them around diversity it’s been an ongoing thing probably for a number of years but from the time that I have been here on campus it’s been work. We’ve been working since I arrived.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A professor at Harvard Medical School has found that gun injuries decrease by roughly 20 percent during the National Rifle Association’s annual conventions.
The finding comes as debate over gun control continues to rage throughout the country in the wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Fla. last month.
Anupam B. Jena, an associate professor of health care policy at the Medical School, and a colleague at Columbia published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, and their research quickly garnered national media attention.
The researchers analyzed private insurance claims from 2007 to 2015, comparing gun injury rates during the weeks before and after the convention to rates during the convention. They found the largest decline in gun injuries among men in states with high rates of firearm ownership.
The NRA Annual Meeting is a gathering that attracts about about 80,000 people each year.
Jena said there are multiple possible explanations for the decline in gun injuries.
“We started off with the hypothesis that just attending the meeting alone might lead to reductions in gun use,” he said.
He also pointed to the possibility that owners of gun ranges and stores could close their businesses while at the convention, bringing down the number of people using guns during that time.
The study has earned national and international press attention from ABC News, The Guardian, Bloomberg, Reuters, Vox, and CNN, among others.
The NRA responded to the publicity with a post on its website that criticized the researchers’ methodology and disputed their findings.
“Whatever nonsense they conducted with the data and their methods, this finding flies in the face of common sense and logic,” the site reads. “It would be laughable if not so completely absurd.”
Asked about the extensive media coverage of his research, Jena said it was mostly accurate, but urged caution in the precise interpretation of the results.
“The answer may not be a 20 percent reduction. Remember, this is just one estimate. There’s a large confidence interval, if you will, around the estimate,” he said.
Still, Jena said, it is likely there is a decrease in injuries during the convention, even if the exact magnitude is unclear.
The study’s release comes at a time when gun control is in the national spotlight. Last month, a shooter opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people. In the wake of the shooting, activists across the country have stepped up efforts to push for stricter gun control legislation.
Harvard affiliates have waded into the national conversation in recent weeks. Students on Harvard’s Longwood campus have protested gun violence. Meanwhile, the College faced criticism for its “lackluster” statement that applicants would not be penalized for protesting gun violence.
The College has since updated its statement with an assurance to prospective students that taking part in peaceful protest would not jeopardize their chances of admission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 12 events ranging from “Unlearning the Language of Misogyny” to “Making Gender and Music,” the Harvard College Women’s Center hosted its twelfth annual Women’s Week—this time with student groups in a larger planning role—from Feb. 26 to March 2.
After months of planning beginning at the start of the fall semester, Women’s Week organizers produced the weeklong initiative to promote gender equity through a series of discussions, panels, and open microphone events dedicated to women’s empowerment and gender issues.  This year’s theme was “Breaking Barriers.”
The programming has expanded since the initiative’s inception in 2007, said Gabriella “Gaby” A. Germanos ’18, who is an intern at the Women’s Center and who co-organized Women’s Week. Germanos said the Women’s Center changed how the event was organized this year.
“We used to have interns and liaisons who were running it—this was supposed to make everyone’s lives easier, but it ended up being a redundant step, and stuff was lost in communication. This year it was us and the student groups,” Germanos said, noting that the Women’s Center partnered with student organizations to host events this year.
Tajrean Rahman ’20, Germanos’s co-organizer, said the variety of events helped contribute to what she called the week’s success. The events ranged from small discussion groups to panel-led talks.
“Even if the room isn’t filled up at the beginning, the discussion and the interest is so present and that makes it seem like even if it is for this small group of people, they’re really benefiting and loving this,” she said.
Hannah A. Lemmons ’20 led “GenderxHarvard,” a discussion about recognizing the ways in which other identities interact with and impact female-identifying individuals.
“I felt like it was particularly important to focus on intersectionality just because I think that’s a conversation that has historically been forgotten in discussions about feminism and women’s rights in general. And across all sorts of these different types of identifiers—woman-identifying, trans, queer,”  she said.
Though Lemmons said the small group setting helped facilitate discussions, she said she hopes to partner with even more student groups at future Women's Weeks to generate more awareness of the topic.
The South Asian Women’s Collective was one of the student groups who  hosted an event—theirs was titled “South Asian Representation in Film.”
“SAWC is a relatively new organization—about two or three years old—so we wanted to have a presence in women’s spaces on campus,” Ahilya Khadka ’19 said.
Khadka said she and her former SAWC co-president Mayukha Karnam ’19 decided to apply for a Women’s Center grant last semester to host an event at Women’s Week.
At the event, Khadka and Karnam showed trailers from films including “The Big Sick” and “Meet the Patels,” followed by a small-group discussion about the portrayal of South Asian women in film.
“South Asian female representation in film is something we’ve talked about with our friends,” Karnam said. “For instance, ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ was an extremely controversial film and was censored in India because it was ‘lady-centric.’ What does that even mean? Having these conversations and getting people to reflect on this issue is important.”
Rahman said she saw Women’s Week as forming an important part of the Women’s Center’s work on campus.
“The mission of Women’s Week is to make it so that student groups are able to lead events that really do challenge, motivate and inspire the student body, and that they do have an intersectional approach to women and gender issues,” she said.
The week of events came to a close with “Nevertheless, She Persisted,” an open microphone event organized by the Seneca, a gender-neutral campus social group, and BlackC.A.S.T., a student theater group focused on providing a space to students of color. The Seneca claims its mission is to make "the Harvard experience more rewarding for undergraduate women."
“Women’s Week is one of the coolest ways we get to contribute to the community,” Liat Z. Rubin ’19, the Seneca's Women’s Outreach Coordinator, said. “I think art is so, so important and can offer ways of reflecting on things we experience in our day-to-day lives, things we want to think more about, and things we want to share with other people. I’m just so excited to be able to celebrate the women who inspire us and use art to do that.”
The open microphone event, attended by roughly 40 people, began with a rendition of Kesha’s “Woman,” performed by Isabel “Isa” M. LaPuerta ’19. Around three-quarters of the attendees were female.
At the event, Germanos said this is a time to reflect on breaking barriers. “The goal is to break barriers big and small; including the barriers that still need to be broken not just by women but by everyone,” she said.
Shiyi “Emma” Shen ’20, a performer at the event, put it more concisely.
“It’s hard to be a woman sometimes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Busy penning holiday cards in 1975 at his home in Cambridge, Law School Professor Frank E. A. Sander ’48 started in surprise: He had received a telegram from Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger.
The Chief Justice had telegramed to say he was impressed with Sander’s newly circulating ideas about alternative dispute resolution. In the coming months, Sander would pioneer this form of dispute resolution as an entirely new method of legal mediation.
Sander, the Bussey Professor Emeritus at the Law School, died on Feb. 25. He was 90.
At the Law School, Sander taught taxation and family law until the seventies, when his career took a turn. While in Sweden on sabbatical, Sander noticed that disputes in labor arbitration were often resolved inexpensively and effectively, whereas family law disputes often ended poorly and antagonistically.
From this observation, Sander eventually formed the concept of alternative dispute resolution, proposing a “multi-door courthouse” where a court official would determine the best resolution process to fit the nature of the dispute.
What Sander initially saw as mere “musings” about Swedish court proceedings ultimately became common practice in community law organizations around the country through the work of federal judge and attorney general Griffin B. Bell.
Harvard law lecturer David A. Hoffman credited Sander with almost single-handedly creating field of dispute resolution.
“It’s surprising now to think about the fact that negotiation was not widely taught in the years that he spent in the Law School,” Hoffman said. “It represents a very big change in the legal culture and the legal curriculum that negotiation is now considered a vitally important part of a legal education.”
In addition to a professorial career that spanned more than 40 years, Sander served as the Law School’s associate dean for 13 years. He also founded the Harvard Clinical Mediation Program and other programs meant to involve law students in the field.
“I think he loved the fact that he could reinvent his career,” Sander’s son, Thomas H. Sander, said. “He just had a lot of curiosity and he just thought he could learn more from new experiences than doing the same thing over and over again."
In the early 1950s, Sander served as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. During his time under Frankfurter, the court heard the famous case Brown v. Board of Education. Sander always dedicated himself to the goal of making education accessible to everyone, Thomas Sander said.
In 1965 and 1966, Sander launched a summer program that allowed 40 African-American college students to come to the Law School to learn about careers in law. The program ultimately provided the model for the Council on Legal Education Opportunity, a national organization aimed at expanding law school opportunities for students of color and low-income students. Sander served on the board of CLEO for its first two years.
“He was very egalitarian,” Thomas Sander said. “I don’t think he believed there was anyone who was above or beneath him. He really humanized Harvard Law School and he made it a more friendly place. He made it a place where it was more welcoming, where it was more mentoring.”
Sander didn’t hog his ideas, Thomas said, but loved to co-author books and was always happy to collaborate and share his theories with others. He was as eager to chat with students and colleagues as he was to catch up on weekend sports with a mailroom employee or a stewardess on a plane.
Sander was someone who carved time out for his students, whether they needed five minutes or an hour, former law student Michael L. Moffitt said.
“A lot of people describe him like their grandfather,” Moffitt said. “And the thing with that is, I bet not so many of us actually have a grandfather like Frank Sander. We wish we had a grandfather like Frank Sander.”
Moffitt said he named his daughter Sander because Sander had been such an influential mentor in his life.
“He was gentle and persistent, he was creative and stubborn, he was kind, he was so many things I would associate with a life well-lived,” Moffitt said. “What parent doesn’t want a life well lived for his or her child?”
Many also remembered Sanders for his ability to work well with a wide variety of people.
“In spite of his many far-reaching accomplishments, there was nothing self-aggrandizing about him. Quite the opposite, he was really notable for his humility and also his wit,” Hoffman said. “He was a team player in the best sense of the word, and really rejoiced in the success of the people that he helped.”
Born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1927, Sander escaped to Boston after Kristallnacht when he was 11 years old, and enrolled at Harvard in 1944. Sander initially considered studying for a Ph.D. in mathematics after concentrating in math, but his sister Dora suggested he try law. On a whim, Sander applied to the Law School, later graduating in 1952.
Thomas Sander said his father’s diverse interests manifested themselves in a multidisciplinary approach to his work. For example, Thomas said his mother’s job as a psychiatric social worker at Mass. General Hospital prompted his father to incorporate many social science concepts into one of his textbooks in order to better equip lawyers to deal with real world problems.
Sander was a lover of music, playing flute as president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and piccolo in the U.S. Army Band during a year spent at West Point.
Law Professor Martha L. Minow, who played violin and piano with Sander in chamber music events he organized, said Sander’s talents as a musician helped define who he was as a professor.
“To play chamber music, you play alongside other people,” Minow said. “You pay close attention to where others are, and when you do, you can actually make something better than what you could do by yourself.”
Sander loved food—he even printed a homemade restaurant guide called “Frank’s Selected Guide to Good Eats,” which he distributed to students and colleagues in something akin to an early version of Yelp. Sander not only hunted for interesting new culinary experiences, but also sought to share them with others, Thomas Sander said.
Thomas Sander recalled the time his sister brought home bread from a Baltic bakery in Chicago. His father loved the bread so much he began collecting requests from his colleagues, friends, and students and distributing mail-ordered loaves monthly.
Minow said Sander had an unparalleled commitment to creating a sense of community.
“This is not a typical thing for a law professor to do,” Minow said.
Sander is survived by his daughter Alison, two sons, Thomas and Ernest, and four grandchildren. A memorial will be held for Sander at Harvard in the fall.
“The Quakers have a saying, ‘Let your life speak,’ and I think my dad was someone who, in a very quiet way, did speak,” Thomas Sander said.

Harvard Business School’s Baker Library has added the accumulated works of Dr. Andrew F. Brimmer, a prominent economist, the first African American federal reserve governor, and a former HBS faculty member, to its permanent Special Collections.
The papers, donated by Brimmer’s wife after his passing in 2012, include scholarly work spanning his entire career. Brimmer’s research career kicked off when he was a Fulbright scholar in India in 1951. He later served as a governor of the Federal Reserve system, a professor at HBS, and an employee in the private sector.
During his time in the private sector, he worked as a consultant and served on the boards of multiple prominent companies, including Dupont and United Airlines, according to his daughter Esther.
A press release from Baker Library stated that the collection includes “subject files, correspondence, research files, teaching records and files,” and other forms of written and audiovisual documentation. Senior Director of Baker Special Collections Laura A. Linard said the works amount to 500 boxes of material, or 17.3 gigabytes digitally.
“[The collection] includes 50 years’ worth of research on the structure of the American economy,” Esther Brimmer said. “It includes his actual published papers and also the notes and documentation that show up underlying the articles and other work.”
Linard said the collection was incredibly comprehensive, covering a large span of time in meticulous detail, and will provide “wonderful” in-depth data for researchers at HBS.
“It really adds to the resources we have in terms of financial history,” Linard said. “Brimmer was an expert on international monetary policy, and so the extent of materials that cover this area in terms of international trade, et cetera, is really helpful.”
In addition to his macroeconomic research, Brimmer also studied the status of African Americans in the national economy as reflected through wage statistics and other economic indicators, Linard said. The press release asserted “several items” from Brimmer’s collected works are currently being highlighted in an exhibit at Baker Library as a part of the African American Student Union’s 50th anniversary celebration.
“We very much wanted the collection, and then we knew when we were doing the exhibit that we wanted to highlight some portion of this,” Linard said.
Linard said she was very excited to see the ways in which HBS students and faculty, as well as academics around the globe, will use the collection.
“There's so many ways that the collection could be used—so many different arenas,” Linard said.
“I think that being able to contribute to a larger intellectual debate on that is something that would have made my father very proud,” Esther Brimmer said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will discuss the addition of the College’s controversial social group policy to the student handbook at its monthly meeting Tuesday, less than a week after the College released its implementation plan for the sanctions.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will present the College’s proposed changes to the handbook on behalf of the Administrative Board as part of the Faculty’s annual review of handbook changes. Harvard’s social life policy bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions in clubs or on athletic teams and from receiving College endorsements for various prestigious fellowships.
The current language in the handbook states that unrecognized organizations, including final clubs and Greek organizations, may not “conduct any activity at Harvard.” The proposed changes will add an additional statement that says, “The College views commitment to non-discrimination as essential to its pedagogical objectives.” The changes also outline the penalties for students who join such organizations.
The new language refers students to the Office of Student Life website for further information on the policy.
The changes further add  a new, general statement on the University’s non-discrimination policy to the section of the handbook dealing with undergraduate student organizations.
An additional edit to the section on independent student organizations—which receive benefits from the College—requires that such organizations comply with an expanded version of the previous non-discrimination policy. The change adds “religion, national origin, age, ancestry, veteran status, disability, military service, or any other legally protected basis” to the list of categories against which independent student organizations cannot discriminate. The list previously included only “race, creed, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or physical disability.”
The proposed changes will also rename the Gender Neutral Housing section of the handbook “Gender Inclusive Housing” and will enable first-years to live with anyone regardless of their gender, a change that administrators confirmed last week. Freshmen will be able to request gender inclusive housing when they fill out their housing application.
In its current form, the Handbook states the option to apply for mixed-gender rooming groups is only open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
Other proposed changes to the handbook include updates to the changing Program in General Education, including the statement that any course used to fulfill the new distribution requirement may be taken pass/fail.
The changes also include: updated language on physical violence, a limit on the number of classes Harvard undergraduate students may cross-register in for credit, a stipulation giving students the ability to receive cross-registration credit for ROTC classes through MIT, and a housing cancellation fee adjustment.
The Faculty will also hear a proposal from Professor Daniel P. Schrag on behalf of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to create a new Environmental Science and Engineering concentration in SEAS.
Currently, ESE is a track within the Engineering Science concentration. It is the only area of study within Engineering Science that does not have its own separate concentration.
The Faculty Council voted in favor of Schrag’s proposal last month. Their vote is purely advisory, though, and the entire Faculty will likely be able to vote directly on the proposal at their next meeting in April.
Khurana is slated to speak Tuesday about early registration, an alternate method of undergraduate course selection.

UPDATED: March 5, 2018 at 3:29 a.m.
The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations awarded Grammy Award-winning artist and activist Solange Knowles their artist of the year award in front of a sold-out crowd Saturday evening.
The Harvard Foundation celebrated Solange at their 33rd Cultural Rhythms Show, an event featuring 11 cultural performances including dance, music, and spoken word. In Solange’s acceptance speech, she shared sources of inspiration she said have uplifted her during darker times.
“Truth be told, I sometimes feel completely and utterly unbrave, tired, confused, and afraid,” Solange said.
She encouraged all black women in the audience to continue breaking boundaries and claiming spaces from which they have been excluded in the past. Solange also cited women, including Nina Simone, Monique, Sandra Bland, and Donna Reynolds, as inspirational individuals who “have been willing to put it all out on the line and live their truth.”
“I want to share this moment, especially with black women who may feel shut out of these spaces, or feel like the doors are not open to them because of one reason or another, and let them know that I see you and I celebrate you tonight and every day,” Solange said.
“Who embodies the power of art as commentary, art as a statement, art as reclamation, better than the Harvard Foundation artist of the year, Solange Knowles?” said Layla Siddig ’19, Harvard Foundation intern and co-director of the event.
Joy B. Nesbitt ’21 agreed and said she thought it was meaningful to see Solange accept the award.
“Solange’s speech was really inspiring, especially being a black woman. It’s beautiful that I get to see such representation and such a wonderful example of excellence and wonder and greatness,” Nesbitt said.
Solange also spoke Saturday about themes of worth and belonging, reflecting on her ancestry and the historical implications of her presence at Harvard.
“My ancestors' hands have built these spaces, and so I know that we belong. And so, while yes, these institutions open doors, and while I understand what the visibility as a young black woman artist standing here before you is... I also have to acknowledge that our worth cannot be invested in waiting for the moment that someone tells us that we are worthy,” she said.
comprises an important opportunity to amplify voices and cultures which tend to be underrepresented.
“Maybe the random bystander is actually not interested in the particular dance or the particular art that this person has been involved in—because it's not mainstream and not celebrated by the Anglo-Saxon society we live in,” Cemaloglu said. “When we are putting these shows on the stage, we’re not only telling that these cultures, that these communities, have their own way of celebrating, their own ways of mourning, their own ways of being, but what we are telling them is that those communities are here."
The Foundation also honored their late director, S. Allen Counter, who died in July. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that Harvard will unveil a portrait of Counter set to hang in Annenberg Hall in coming weeks.
Solange said she wants her work to not only be seen as entertainment, but as a statement of her identity.
“I want to sculpt, I want to build, I want to tear down walls and build new ones, I want to dismantle, I want to disrupt, I want to bore, I want to quiet you down, I want to create frequency, and I feel so incredibly humbled and beyond gracious and thankful that you have allowed me to do this work,” Solange said.
Claire E. Townsend ’18, a member of the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, said Solange shook each person’s hand and introduced herself to each singer before the group's performance.
“I didn’t know what to expect, but I was blown away, and she was beautiful in person,” Townsend said.

Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker received the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism at a ceremony administered by the Humanist Hub and the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists and Agnostics Sunday afternoon.
Over 100 people gathered in the Science Center for the ceremony, which recognized Pinker for his scholarly research and publications around themes of humanism.
Pinker, who recently released a book titled "Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism and Progress," has worked with HCHAA and the Humanist Hub for years. 
Jeyna Doshi ’20, President of HCHAA, said Pinker is a long time friend to both organizations, having introduced the first Cultural Humanism award twelve years ago.
The Harvard Square-based Humanist Hub and the undergraduate organization HCHAA both aim to bring together atheists, agnostics, and other non-religious individuals  around the philosophy of Humanism.
Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein, who hosted the event, defined Humanism similar to the way Pinker defined the philosophy in his recent book.
“The goal of maximizing human flourishing—life, health, happiness, freedom, knowledge, love, richness of experience—may be called humanism,” he said.
Pinker said he drew heavily from enlightenment philosophy for his new book, praising the idea that we can “use knowledge to enhance human flourishing.”
In an hour-long presentation after receiving the award, Pinker outlined four themes of enlightenment: reason, science, humanism, and progress. Optimism about our time pervaded Pinker’s presentation.
Seeking to combat what he called some of his colleagues’ pessimism, Pinker said, “I have discovered that intellectuals hate progress.”
Pinker presented a few of the 75 graphs in his book, showing what he called an upward trajectory of human progress as measured through various metrics. The graphs showed a consistent uptick in GDP per capita, longevity, and prosperity, as well as a decline in war, infant mortality, and violent crime.
Pinker attributed our society’s “gloomier and gloomier” future projections to the nature of news, which “does not cover graduate developments,” and a negativity bias, which he said results in bad news resonating more than good news does.
Pinker is the author of 16 books and has won a number of awards for his work from various organizations including the American Psychological Association and the National Academy of Sciences.
Though he was unable to attend the ceremony, University president-elect Lawrence S. Bacow sent his praise, which a HCHAA member read aloud to the audience. Bacow wrote he has read almost all of Pinker’s books.
“He is a brilliant writer and scholar,” Bacow wrote.
Previous recipients of the award have included Salman Rushdie and the late actress Carrie Fisher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to endorse a proposal to establish a prison education system at Harvard.
The proposed program, which would give currently incarcerated individuals who qualify the ability to take classes from University faculty, would be modeled on similar initiatives at Columbia, Cornell, and Yale.
The legislation also calls on Harvard to do away with a question on its admissions application that asks applicants if they have a criminal record. Leah S. Yared ’19, the chair of the Crimson's magazine, said the application question serves as a “deterrent” for prospective applicants who have a criminal record.
Both Yared and Sonya A. Karabel ’18, an inactive Crimson editor, presented the legislation as members of the the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform, which worked with UC representatives to craft the legislation.
Some representatives opposed eliminating the question, arguing it is needed to give the College a fuller view of each applicant.
“I mean, they ask so many things. They ask about your religion, your gender, everything,” UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20 said. “I just feel like depriving the admissions office of information that is relevant to experiences as a human being, I think it misinforms the admissions office.”
A College spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday evening.
The Council also passed legislation at the meeting calling on the administration of University President-elect  Lawrence S. Bacow to “continue in its predecessor’s footsteps” in supporting undocumented students.
Current President Drew G. Faust has condemned the Trump administration’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and has lobbied congressional leaders for a permanent fix to the program.
The legislation urges the administration to call on Congress to pass a “clean Dream Act,” which would ensure the “protection of DACA recipients without penalizing or criminalizing their family members.”
Mather House Representative Eduardo Gonzalez ’18, who co-sponsored the resolution, added an amendment recognizing that “no undocumented immigrant is illegal” and that all undocumented immigrants deserve “freedom from a life of fear and uncertainty,” prompting some opposition from Council members.
Some representatives objected to the expanded purview of the amendment, as the legislation as originally written only encompassed immigrants who qualified for DACA or Temporary Protected Status.
“I think there’s consensus on DACA,” said Kirkland House Representative Parth Thakker ’18, who abstained from voting. “But I don’t want to us to conflate DACA with all illegal immigration as a whole.”
Also at Sunday’s meeting, the Council failed to pass a piece of legislation that would have funded Mental Health Matters week. The initiative, a similar version of which the UC funded last year, would have funded two petting zoos, a smoothie study break, and massages.
Multiple representatives said they believed that the money—which would have added up to $3,000 in total—should be used in more substantive ways.
“The way that you can address mental health concerns is by giving more money to therapy, and to making sure people have access to genuine mental health resources,” UC Parliamentarian Sonya Kalara ’21 said.  “Making it seem like that problem can be fixed with something like a petting zoo, I think undermines what mental health really is.”
Though a majority of representatives voted in favor of the legislation, with 18 of 35 supporting the policy, the legislation needed a two-thirds majority to pass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the final two minutes of Saturday night’s regular season finale against Columbia, Harvard men’s basketball looked up at the scoreboard to see a 19-point lead. It had clinched its first Ivy League title since 2015 and would be the number one seed in the conference tournament.
The Crimson (17-12, 12-2 Ivy) had held a comfortable margin against the Lions (8-19, 5-9) for the majority of the contest, leading by as much as 25 in the second half. After sophomore forward Henry Welsh extended the lead to 88-69 with an acrobatic wraparound layup, coach Tommy Amaker turned toward his bench and re-inserted his three seniors back into the court, one-by-one.
Senior captain Chris Egi was the first to check in, followed by guard Andre Chatfield. Two possessions later, forward Zach Yoshor stepped onto the court.
The three seniors were freshmen the last time Harvard put up a conference banner in Lavietes Pavilion and the only group who had experienced the thrills of the NCAA Tournament. Although the group saw little game action in conference play, Egi and his classmates played an important mentorship role to this young Crimson team and were three critical pieces of the team’s “19 Strong.”
In fitting fashion, the last points in Harvard’s 93-74 blowout win came from one of the seniors—in the form of a triple. From the top of the circle, Chatfield drilled his second game attempt from three and increased the Crimson’s count of triples to 17, a remarkable tally that tied a program record.
Before the clock hit zero, sophomore point guard Christian Juzang waved Egi over, handing his captain the ball to ensure this historic moment concluded in the hands of the senior. The story of the sixth-ever Ivy League championship for Harvard men’s basketball had been written.
“Having the opportunity to have a chance to win a championship and being able to win it, you definitely don’t take that for granted,” Egi said. “You’ll be a champion forever so good way to go out. I love these guys. These guys mean everything to me, seeing all the young guys doing their thing on the court and I’m just trying to do my best to help in anyway possible. Being able to win with my brothers, my family, that means everything to me.”
MAGIC FROM DEEP
From the opening four minutes, there was a noticeable feeling in the crowd that this would be a special night from deep range. Sophomore forward Seth Towns had knocked down back-to-back triples in the initial two-and-a-half minutes, followed by a three from sophomore Christian Juzang a minute later. Overall, the Crimson went six-of-eight from deep in the opening ten minutes.
The accurate three-point shooting didn’t end there, though. Junior wing Corey Johnson, who already converted two threes in those first ten minutes, added another at the 4:25 mark. Sophomore forward Justin Bassey and freshman guard Rio Haskett tallied two more.
In particular, Haskett’s two game triples capstoned a noticeable turn-around in the freshman’s offensive game this season. The freshman guard had been shooting 27 percent from the field prior to conference play, and had converted on just five triples out of 30 attempts in that span. Haskett has shown much more confidence in his offensive game in recent weeks, showcased by a four-of-seven night last week against Princeton. Tonight was another positive sign.
“We have a phrase we use, let the shot find you,” Amaker said. “I thought [Rio] did that. He wasn’t hunting his own shot. He was moving it, fitting in. The ball is being reversed, kicking to him and he is wide open. It is a rhythm shot, it feels right. Those are the shots you want to take and you will live with the result.”
All in all, Harvard’s 60.7 percent night from three is an indication not simply of accurate shooting, but improved court awareness and targeting of open teammates on the perimeter. On Friday night, the Crimson logged 20 assists—the second highest of the season. The season’s highest? Saturday night, when Harvard totaled 24 assists. Juzang and Bassey led the team with seven dishes each alongside their combined six game triples.
“I thought the start and our ability to really be in attack mode, with 24 assists and share the ball and make the shots that we made,” Amaker said. “Just a tremendous effort from our kids to share the ball and be unselfish.”
BUILDING ON THE CRIMSON LEGACY
Before Saturday night’s game, Amaker gathered his team in the locker room and showed his young team video clips of past Ivy champions. Given Amaker had won five straight Ivy championships from 2011-2015, the 11-year coach certainly had a breadth of content to draw from.
Harvard basketball royalty was also in the stands to watch the Crimson hold up the Princeton Alumni Trophy for the sixth time in program history. Last year’s co-captain Zena Edosomwan enthusiastically supported his former teammates from courtside, while 2010-2012 captain Oliver McNally also watched from the stands.
Johnson in particular noted the past accomplishments of the program built by these alumni, and emphasized that the task at hand was to continue this legacy by earning another NCAA tournament berth.
“Personally, it really just motivates us and gives us that fire, that edge, to really see how close we were and see the past teams and players,” Johnson said. “When I was getting recruited here, the players that I first met like Siyani [Chambers] and Jonah [Travis] and Steve [Moundou-Missi], all those players, Laurent [Rivard], just huge names in this program. Just seeing what they’ve done and how much they’ve achieved at Harvard and just to be in that mention now is surreal for us. We’ve still got a lot of work to do like I said, but we do feel really good about where we are right now.”
As Johnson concluded, Harvard will need to continue its hot shooting streak of late into the postseason if it hopes to see a return to the Big Dance. Having just made the trip to the Palestra the prior week, the Crimson faces No. 4 seed Cornell in the semifinals of the Ivy League Tournament this Saturday at noon.
Although it has checked off one box, there are still many boxes left remaining in March.
“We are very proud of this team,” Amaker said. “It is a very young team and it has been a few years since we have been able to say that about Harvard Basketball, being Ivy champions. I’m sure at some point we will look at this and find it to be incredibly rewarding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 21 Crimson women’s water polo team (7-4) competed this weekend in the Harvard invitational. On Saturday, the Crimson first beat Toronto in an exhibition game, 7-3, and then went on to defeat No. 18 San Jose State, 7-6. On Sunday, Harvard closed out the weekend, falling to No. 15 Wagner, 10-6, in the morning, but bounced back in the afternoon with an impressive 15-6 win over Siena.
“It was a solid weekend overall,” co-captain Sami Strutner said “We won a close match against  San Jose and look forward to learning from the mistakes over the weekend and growing as a team.”
No. 21 HARVARD 15, SIENA 6
Dominating from the start of the game in the final contest of the Invitational, the Crimson immediately tallied six goals in the first frame against Siena (1-10). Strutner, sophomore Julie Harrison, freshman Olivia Price and freshman Quinne Pursell, all contributed to Harvard taking a 9-1 lead at halftime.
In the second half, freshman Jilly Cronin scored four goals, complementing Strutner’s hat trick to guarantee a strong Crimson victory. In the net, junior Sam Acker had fourteen saves.
No. 15 WAGNER 10, No. 21 HARVARD 6
In Sunday morning’s game against No. 15 Wagner (8-6), Harvard was unable to recover from a 5-1 halftime deficit. Wagner immediately took control of the game, scoring the first four goals. In the second frame, Price scored the Crimson’s lone goal of the half.
In the third quarter, Harvard staged a come-back, gaining momentum and scoring three goals. Unfortunately the co-captain Cleo Harrington’s 13 saves in net, second half goals by Price, Harrison, junior Kristen Hong, Strutner and sophomore Mathilde Ribordy were not enough for the Crimson to win. The dominant Wagner offense found the back of the net five times in the second half, leading to the final game score of 10-6.
No. 21 HARVARD 7, No. 18, SAN JOSE STATE 6
In a closely-contested matchup between Harvard and No. 18 San Jose State (5-11), the two teams went goal for goal until the last minute of play. After the final quarter opened with a 5-5 score, Strutner found the back of the net with 4:41 left in the game and Hong scored 58 seconds later on a penalty shot.
The Crimson has played San Jose State eight-times. Saturday’s win marks Harvard’s first win over San Jose State in the history of the series, and the Crimson’s second ever win over a team in the MPSF Conference. Harvard’s last victory against a team in the MPSF Conference was over Arizona State in 2002.
No. 21 HARVARD 7, TORONTO 3
Harvard immediately took the lead in its first matchup of the Harvard Invitational. In an exhibition game against Toronto (2-0), the Crimson scored six goals in the opening period to take an early 6-1 lead. In the second quarter, Harvard scored again before switching to a defensive mindset for the second half.
“I was happy we made steps forward against San Jose but there is still a lot of work to be done,” Harrington said. “We are looking forward to getting a lot of experience against tough teams on our California trip over spring break.”
Next week, Harvard heads to California for 10 games on its annual West Coast Trip, beginning with the SDSU Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Morgan Cheek grabbed the first point of his collegiate career in just the second game of his freshman year, tallying an assist to Devin Dwyer ’16 in a matchup against Duke. More than three years later, on Saturday afternoon against the visiting Hartford Hawks, the star senior attackman recorded his 157th point for the Crimson.
157 might seem like a rather arbitrary number when it stands alone, but on the Harvard men’s lacrosse all-time points list, it is good for a spot in the top ten. In fact, with his assist to sophomore Kyle Anderson at the 1:26 mark of the first quarter, Cheek became just the third Crimson player since the turn of the century to earn his place in the group. Dwyer was the most recent, and before him, Jeff Cohen ’12 climbed to seventh on the list.
“It’s pretty cool to be up there, but it’s definitely not something I think about on a day-to-day basis,” Cheek said. “But that being said, it’s an honor to be among the guys on that list, especially ones like Dwyer who I looked up to when I was starting out here.”
As usual, Cheek’s contributions were key for Harvard (3-1, 0-0 Ivy) as his two goals and three assists helped pace the team to a wire-to-wire 14-10 victory over Hartford (1-3, 0-0 America East). Sophomore attackman Ryan Graff contributed the same stat line as Cheek, while Anderson led the team with four goals on the afternoon.
The biggest plus for the Crimson on Saturday was not any individual performance, however, as the team’s power play was much improved from how it was in the first three games of the year. After going a combined 2-for-13 in man-up situations through those three games, Harvard went 3-for-3 against the Hawks.
“Our execution in the man-up was poor through the first few games of the season,” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “But our guys have stayed focus and kept working on it, and we finally got some results today with some important goals.”
Harvard took advantage of man-up opportunities to tally its first and last goal, as well as its most important goal of the game. After racing out to a 6-2 lead early in the second quarter, the Crimson gave up three straight goals to Hartford and it looked as if the two teams would enter intermission right back where they started, in a deadlock.
With 0:38 left in the half, however, sophomore midfielder Watson Cheek found Graff right in front of the net, and Graff finished the sequence to restore a two-goal lead for Harvard. Anderson added another score 14 seconds later, firmly seizing the momentum back for the home side.
“It was definitely a game of runs, and I’m proud of how the team responded each time they made a run,” Wojcik said. “Particularly in the fourth quarter, to go on that 4-0 run to ice the game really says a lot about the group of guys we have.”
After coming close at 6-5, the Hawks never came within a goal of the Crimson again. Captain Sean Coleman scored his first goal of the season early in the fourth quarter to stop a 3-0 Hartford run, and freshman midfielder Kyle Salvatore also added an important insurance goal, his second of the year. In all, Harvard got eight goals of production from freshmen and sophomores on Saturday, a large number considering the amount of senior talent on the team.
“The younger guys have all been working hard and they’re getting better each week,” Morgan Cheek said. “I see some similarities between my class when we were sophomores and the sophomore class we have now––a lot of guys who just needed that one year of experience to get their feet wet, and are now contributing a lot.”
Besides Salvatore, several other freshmen made key contributions as well. Face-off specialist Steven Cuccurullo won 15 of his 27 face-offs, and midfielder Charlie Olmert also turned in a strong performance collecting ground balls and finding teammates for opportunities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took the two teams more than the allotted 60 minutes on Saturday to decide the winner. As the Harvard women’s lacrosse team took on perennial opponent Yale in enemy territory.
Crimson junior midfielder Keeley MacAfee’s goal with 2:55 left in the second half tied the game to force overtime and marked MacAfee’s second straight six-goal performance. One minute and 24 seconds into the extra period, a Yale overtime goal iced the game, 16-15, in favor of the Bulldogs.
Things were even throughout the afternoon grudge match at Reese Stadium with both teams equaling each other in nearly every category.
“It was a good hard-fought game,” coach Lisa Miller said. “Both teams played well, neither team gave up anything. It was a competitive Ivy league game that came down to situational play and we made some nice plays down the stretch to tie it up.”
Harvard (2-2, 0-1 Ivy) matched its opponent in clears, turnovers, and draw controls en route to a back-and-forth match that went down to the wire. The game saw its largest differences in ground balls as well as shots as Yale (4-0, 1-0) outshot the Crimson 43-32 in the game.
The shot count, according to the coach, does mirror the story of the game.
“They put 27 shots on frame,” Miller said. “We were pretty similar. We’re an efficiency offense. We don’t take a lot of outside shots. We take quality shots and put them on frame.”
Fouls by Harvard contributed to several shots for the opposition.
“They were on the line maybe 12 times,” Miller said. “That’s going to increase their shot output, and a lot of that is off-ball fouls.”
The pendulum swung the Bulldog’s way initially going up 2-0 in the first with goals by senior midfielder Emily Granger and freshman attacker Kayla Duperrouzel. The Crimson rallied back with five unanswered goals including McAfee’s first.
Harvard had a chance to put the game away at that point, but Yale rallied back and eventually pushed the score to 7-7, tying at the half. A combination of some inexperience and poor clearances on the defensive end led to a 5-2 run by the Bulldogs.
“We’re pretty inexperienced on the [defensive] end,” Miller said. “Until we get a little bit more experience. We’re going hard we just need more experience to some of those [critical] decisions in game. The experience will come with time.”
The two teams traded goal for goal in the second half as well. Sophomore Bulldog midfielder Barrett Carlson exploded for four goals in the second half alone. Yale rode her performance to a 15-13 lead with only five minutes to play.
That is when The Crimson stepped up with two timely scores. Junior midfielder Caroline Garrity scored her single unassisted goal with 4:18 to play to bring Harvard within one. Soon after, MacAfee added her sixth goal, unassisted with 2:55 to play in the game. The scoring outburst was said to be a product of good team play.
“They have good team chemistry,” Miller said. “They have good game understanding and good timing; they’re shooting the ball really well. We’re pretty confident on the [offensive] end of the ball.
A goal by senior Bulldog attacker Kiwi Comizio with 4:36 to go in the overtime period was the deciding factor in the matchup.
The Bulldogs remained undefeated with the first game of Ivy League play while the Crimson fell to .500 on the season. Coming into a game against an undefeated team and a known rival did not change anything for the team.
“Coaches go one game at a time” Miller said. “The next game is always the most important game. You do not want to live your life thinking this game is bigger than any other game.”
A loss this past weekend showed areas for improvement for the future, including experience and clearances on the defensive end.
“I’d like to see us a little more confident in our clearing game” Miller said. “If we had just been a little more confident in our clearing we could have gone to 8-2. Then it would not have been a contest. [It’s just] growing pains.”
Despite the loss, there are still many good things to look for going forward.
“I was happy,” said Miller. “There were so many good things that you cannot be unhappy. All the [negatives] are fixable. It’s so early in the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Competing in the Carolina Classic, the second of three tournaments before the beginning of conference play, Harvard softball (3-6) dropped three out of four of its games in North Carolina. The Crimson nearly flew home with a 2-2 split, but a late offensive push by Kansas downed Harvard in extra innings on Saturday.
“Being able to beat an SEC team and push a Big 12 team to extra innings were great achievements,” junior pitcher Katie Duncan said. “As a team we came down to this tournament to push ourselves and walk away better. We absolutely achieved that goal.”
NORTH CAROLINA 6, HARVARD 1
North Carolina (7-13) rebounded in its second matchup against the Crimson, this time prevailing in Sunday’s consolation game, 6-1.
Harvard amassed just three hits—junior second baseman Meagan Lantz, freshman first baseman Morgan Melito, and senior left fielder Alexa Altchek combined for four total bases.
“The one thing we are targeting to work on offensively is making adjustments faster,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “Better pitchers succeed in throwing off timing and keeping the hitter off balance so it is important for us to know what adjustments we need to make and employ them every during our at bats.”
A shutout was in play until the bottom of the seventh. In the last frame, junior third baseman Erin Lockhart scored on a single to left field courtesy of Altchek.
The Crimson had no answer for Tar Heels starter Brittany Pickett until it pushed across that unearned run in its last trip to the plate. Pickett tossed all seven innings, allowing just three hits and a walk and striking out two.
Two of North Carolina’s runs came via the long ball. Tar Heels Hailey Jensen and Kristina Burkhardt each hit solo shots. The two home runs were more than Harvard had allowed in its previous eight games.
KANSAS 4, HARVARD 3 (8 INNINGS)
Despite two late comeback bids, the Crimson ultimately fell to Kansas (16-3) in Saturday’s lone game. The loss curtailed Harvard’s bid to compete in Sunday’s championship.
In the seventh and eighth innings, the Crimson appeared poised to escape unscathed on the defensive end, but each time the Jayhawks managed to drive in runs with two outs.
In the top of the seventh, Kansas center fielder Brittany Jackson led off the inning reaching on a fielding error, but Duncan responded by inducing consecutive groundouts. However, cleanup hitter and catcher Karli Ridling avoided that same fate, roping a double into the left-center gap to drive in Jackson, putting the Jayhawks on top, 3-2.
The Crimson held on in its half of the seventh to extend the contest to extra innings. Singles by Olivia Giaquinto and co-captain Kaitlyn Schiffhauer along with a walk by Maddy Kaplan loaded the bases. With two outs, Kansas shortstop Shelby Gayre misplayed a ball off the bat of Lantz, and Schiffhauer scored with the tying run.
But this come-from-behind effort would prove to be all for naught, as the Jayhawks pushed across another run in the top of the eighth. With two outs and a runner on second, pinch hitter Mikayla Warren singled to drive in Erin McGinley with the go-ahead run, making it a 4-3 ballgame.
“It’s a great opportunity for us to face these better teams, especially offensively because it challenges us to stay within our game plan and make adjustments according to whoever we’re facing,” Rich said.
In the bottom of the sixth, Harvard scored its first run since the first inning to tie the game, 2-2. Lantz faced a favorable 3-1 hitter’s count but then fouled off six consecutive pitches to extend her at-bat. Lantz finally broke the stalemate on the 11th pitch of the at-bat, launching a home run over the left-field wall for her first long ball of the season.
Duncan replaced Giaquinto in the circle to start the third inning, and the junior finished out the remaining six innings. Duncan allowed two earned runs in her outing, further establishing herself as the team’s ace.
HARVARD 4, NORTH CAROLINA 3
In the second game of Friday’s doubleheader, the Crimson faced off against the tournament’s host and was locked in a contentious battle from the start. Heading into the bottom of the seventh, North Carolina trailed, 4-3, but had scored in its previous trip to the plate and had its two, three, and four hitters due up.
The situation appeared promising for the Tar Heels at the outset, but they immediately ran into a major roadblock: Harvard’s Katie Duncan.
Duncan silenced the first two hitters, Kiani Ramsey and Taylor Wike, with full-count strikeouts. After allowing a single through the left side of the infield, Duncan regrouped and forced Brittany Pickett to look at strike three to end the game.
“Honestly I wasn’t even thinking about who they had up to bat, but how I could execute the best possible pitches I could,” Duncan said. “I think the coaches adjusted to the hitters up by going more to the curveball and changeup than we had in the past innings.”
Duncan scattered 11 hits over seven innings to pick up her first complete-game victory of the season. One of the three runs she conceded was unearned, and she sat down five batters on strikeouts.
Offensively, Rich led the way. The junior went three-for-four, scored two runs, and stole two bases.
The Crimson jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the top of the first and broke a 2-2 tie with two more runs in the top of the fifth. In the first inning, Rich picked up one each of her hits, runs, and stolen bases, and Melito doubled in a run. Back-to-back singles from co-captain and right fielder Maddy Kaplan and Lantz chased in Harvard’s fifth-inning runs.
ELON 5, HARVARD 1
Coach Jenny Allard opted to save Duncan in the opening matchup of the Carolina Classic. Sophomore hurlers Giaquinto and Alissa Hiener held their own in Duncan’s stead, but the Crimson’s offense struggled to produce in its first action of the weekend.
The game was relatively close until the bottom of the fifth, when Elon (11-6) plated three runs on two hits. Harvard redeemed itself on a double by Phoenix Kara Shutt when Schiffhauer relayed to Lantz, who threw out the Elon baserunner at the plate. After being cut down trying to score, however, the Phoenix managed three runs, pushed home by a single, a fielder’s choice, and a wild pitch.
After scoring a run in the top of the fourth on an RBI single from freshman left fielder Alyssa Saldana, the Crimson’s bats went silent. In the three innings that followed, Harvard went three up, three down each trip to the plate. None of these nine outs were punch outs, but many involved soft contact, including a foul out and a pair of pop outs.
Just three Crimson batters managed to record hits—Kaplan, Lockhart, and Saldana all singled once in the loss. Kaplan and Melito each drew walks.
Putting the bat on the ball has not been a major problem for Harvard thus far in 2018. Just two of its 21 outs came via the strikeout.

In its final weekend of the regular season, Harvard women’s basketball completed the season sweep on the New York Ivies in its trip to the Empire State, topping Cornell and Columbia on the road.
The Crimson (18-9, 10-4 Ivy) cruised to victory on Saturday and Sunday following weather delays delaying the Friday game. Harvard spread the ball around, with nine double-digit performances recorded on the weekend.
“This is always a hard weekend because the travel involved is brutal,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “And throw in a storm and all the question marks and delays, it makes it more of a challenge. We weren’t allowed to practice Friday.”
With victories over the Big Red (7-20, 3-11) and the Lions (8-21, 2-12), the Crimson heads into the Ivy League Tournament as the number three seed, set to take on two-seeded Penn in the first round.
“There were obstacles, but we still had to come out and prove we deserve to play next week in the tournament and into March Madness,” sophomore guard Katie Benzan said.
HARVARD 78, COLUMBIA 59
Harvard was able to take control of the game following a run in the first quarter. After Columbia jumped out to a quick 8-4 lead, the Crimson jumped into the driver’s seat. Harvard finished the quarter on a 15-3 run. Following the run, the Crimson refused to look back.
Harvard was led by freshman forward Jadyn Bush, who netted a career-high 21 points against the Lions. The rookie also shot 80 percent from the field and snagged six rebounds. Bush’s partner down low, sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm, also helped control the paint, scoring eight points and grabbing nine rebounds, while also recording a team-high five assists and four shots blocked shots.
The Crimson owned the inside throughout the weekend, out-rebounding Columbia 49-31. Boehm and Bush were not the only players contributing to Harvard’s dominance in the paint; sophomore guard Sydney Skinner had eight rebounds and junior co-captain Madeline Raster recorded seven rebounds to go along with her 16 points. Raster led the Crimson in scoring over the course of the entire weekend, netting 30 points against both the Lions and the Big Red.
“Rebounding was really important to us, and it wasn’t really one person,” Delaney-Smith said. “We had everybody in the rebounding column.”
In addition, Benzan scored 11 points and senior guard Taylor Rooks scored 10, adding to the list of double-digit performances. Benzan, Rooks, and Raster each scored in the double-digits in both games this weekend.
“We just have so many scorers and so many ways to score,” Delaney-Smith said.
For the second straight weekend, Harvard’s defense shined as well. Columbia shot only 35.4 percent from the field and 16.7 percent from behind the arc. This marks the fourth straight game in which the Crimson has allowed less than 70 points.
“We need to sustain the defensive effort and take care of the ball,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s the combination where this team turned the corner.”
HARVARD 91, CORNELL 57
Harvard once again took advantage of an early run to top Cornell. Its 12-0 run in the second quarter sparked an explosive period in which the Crimson outscored Big Red 30-13, going into the half up 49-31 and in complete control.
Harvard’s offense was firing on all cylinders in its trip to Ithaca, topping 90 points for the second time this season. Five different Crimson scored in the double digits, led by Benzan, who showcased her versatility against the Big Red. To go along with her team-high 18 points, Benzan grabbed seven rebounds, recorded seven assists, and and swiped three steals. Benzan went four-for-six from behind the arc, and even grabbed her own rebound on a miss and scored after being fouled.
Benzan was not the only offensive force for Harvard. Boehm owned the paint, recording her fourth double-double of the year on 15 points and 10 rebounds. This marks the second-straight year in the sophomore’s career with at least four double-doubles.
Redford was able to net a career-high 12 points as one of seven Crimson that shot at least 50 percent from the field. This includes Rooks, who also had 12 points, and Raster, who was six-for-seven from the field and two-for-three from behind the arc for 14 points.
Harvard’s accuracy was the reason for its offense’s explosiveness, as the Crimson shot a whopping 62.1 percent from the field, including 55 percent from three-point range. Harvard was also perfect from the line, going eight-for-eight on free throws. This was an important facet for the Crimson, who suffered woes from the free-throw line at the beginning of the year.
Harvard’s defense proved a handful as well, holding Cornell to shoot just 32.8 percent from the field and 17.6 percent from beyond the arc. The Crimson also controlled the inside, outscoring the Big Red 48-28 in the point and recording seven blocks.
Harvard will ride its four-game winning streak into the Ivy League Tournament in Philadelphia, heading into enemy territory to take on Penn in the Palestra.
“Whatever team we see in the tournament, they’re all good teams to prepare for,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’ve lost to all of them and beaten all of them, so they’re all good teams.”
Last season, the Crimson was the number three seed. Harvard would see an early exit, losing its opening game to Princeton, 68-47.
“We’re all thinking that we have unfinished business in Philly and we need to prove what we can do,” Benzan said. “It’s going to be tough, but we’re all positive for the weekend.”

Housing Day is coming up quickly and freshman anticipation is building. While certain people worry about house qualities like location, n+1 availability, and dhall food, the true sign of a good house is a good mascot. Using a very complicated, scientific algorithm, we calculated a best-to-worst ranking of the house mascots.

1. Pfoho: Polar Bear
A consistent zoo animal favorite, the polar bear is an impassioned climate change activist and weighs enough to break the ice for incoming freshman.
2. Dunster: Moose
This mascot, hailing from Canada, can be found consistently bragging about his free health care and his handsome Prime Minister. He also speaks French and hangs out with Drake.
3. Quincy: Penguin
He is always down for some shenanigans ("smile and wave, boys"), and even though he’s always dressed up for a black tie event, he is not punching the Fly.
4. Mather: Gorilla
While this mascot spends most of his time trapped in the “concrete jungle” that is Mather, his many appearances in Housing Day videos definitely up his street cred.
5. Winthrop: Lion
	
Although a Pride of Lions is a cute (yet kinda cliche) way to represent House spirit and community, it’s kinda forgettable.
6. Eliot: Mastodon
The mastodon is as extinct as Eliot's old money elitism. Oh wait...Fête is still a thing.
7. Leverett: Rabbit
Everyone knows the rabbit is just a washed-up bunny. This mascot is better left in his rabbit hole.
8. Cabot: Fish
This mascot is fitting considering that to some, the feeling of getting Cabot on Housing Day is remarkably close to the feeling you’d get when you asked for a puppy and your parents got you a goldfish, but you eventually learn to love it anyhow.
9. Kirkland: Boar
This mascot screams evokes yawns of boardom. Seriously, who wants to be represented by a large pig?
10. Currier: Tree
Really…a tree? Couldn’t think of something with legs?
11. Adams: Acorn
The only thing worse than the Adams Acorn would be an Adams Apple.
12. Lowell: Nothing
How can we express House pride if we have no mascot to take pictures with on Housing Day?
While, according to our complex algorithm, this ranking is definitive, remember: The only thing that really matters on Housing Day is what kind of life form is on your House t-shirt and whether or not it is insta-worthy.

Famous for its concrete composition and unusual traditions, Mather House towers over the Charles River and, according to its residents, over the rest of the upperclassmen Houses. Any freshman who gets Mather on Housing Day can expect a lot of House spirit and a great community for the next three years. The majority of Harvard students may be lonely virgins, but everyone knows that Matherites have “more singles, more sex.”

Mather is made up of two buildings, the Lowrise and the Tower, with the latter comprised mostly of senior housing. Sophomores usually live on the third or fourth floors of the Lowrise, in suites composed of four to six singles with a large common room on a separate floor and connecting bathrooms. Because the common rooms are so large, any of the rooms in the Lowrise can serve as party suites.

Mather’s House life is mostly centered around the dining hall, where Matherites tend to spend a great deal of time. Mather also has other common spaces, such as the library, the JCR, or the Big TV Room. One of the House’s signature events is Happy Hour, a biweekly gathering with food and booze, the equivalent to other Houses’ Steins. Everyone in Mather is close, from the students to the tutors and the Faculty Deans.
Mather House is unique because its House Committee has a Games Commissioner in charge of the Louie Cup, a sort of IM competition among Matherites (yes, it’s named after nearby liquor store Louie’s). And, of course, there’s Mather Lather, the annual foam party hosted in the dhall.
The House’s Faculty Deans, L. “Maha” Mahadevan and Amala Mahadevan, are new this year, which means they get to learn about community and traditions from Matherites themselves!

House Committee co-chairs Pablo A. Reimers ’19 and Sofia C. Kennedy ’19 sat down with us to give us the inside scoop on Mather:
What would you say to Mather’s detractors, who criticize its location and appearance?
PR: The thing about the distance is that, since you’re walking through the Square to get here, it doesn’t feel as far. It’s also nice because it means that all the people who spend time in Mather are Matherites.
SK: We’re also close to eight of the other Houses. So even though we’re farther away from the Yard, it’s a quick walk to any of the River Houses. I think we have one of the most beautiful dining halls; it’s comfy with a nice view of the river. We have to compensate for the ugliness, so the community is even closer.
PR: Looks aren’t everything.
What are some cool spots in Mather?
SK: We have a Tranquility Room; it’s a meditation room with a bunch of mats and places to sit; it’s kind of in a secluded part of Mather. We have a sunken courtyard, where we host Happy Hours when it’s warmer out and where we have our Spring Formal.
PR: There are some weird nooks—there are some random circles of couches which are underused, but where some people hang out. We’re also next to outdoor basketball and soccer courts.
Compare Mather to a Harvard Square eatery.
PR: The Kong.
SK: Absolutely. It’s jank but you love it.

Looking for modern housing? Reliable hot water? History? Or to see a freshly-butchered goat roast on an open fire? That’s a bit specific. But Dunster is the House for you.

Dunster is newly renovated, with a beautiful dining hall, a clean, modern, almost hotel-like interior, and a great view of the Charles River. Sophomores placed in Dunster will end up living in hallway doubles, quads with two doubles, or hallway singles. Most of Dunster’s housing comes with hall bathrooms, although there are a few suites with their own bathrooms.
The eight-person suite on the fourth floor often throws parties for the whole House. There are two seven-person suites that have great views of the river, and often host parties as well.
We interviewed Mitchell P. Johns ’19, one of the Dunster HoCo co-chairs, about what makes Dunster (in his opinion) the best House.
Johns joined HoCo his sophomore fall, saying that “coming from freshman year I was excited to have a tighter House community, and I definitely found that in Dunster.” He cited HoCo, intramurals, and working—or frequenting—the Dunster Grille as great ways to become more involved in the community.

As far as common spaces, there’s more than just the beloved Grille. The Dunster gym (which apparently lots of non-Dunster students use), the study rooms, and the JCR are big community-oriented spaces. He also thinks that the courtyard is “a great place to work outside and see other Dunster people.” (We hear bouncy houses appear in the courtyard a few times a year.) According to Johns, if there were a vibe to Dunster’s community, it would be something like “an outgoing and kind of try-anything vibe.”
One of the most exciting aspects of Dunster is its history. Does the name sound familiar? It should; Dunster is named after Henry Dunster, Harvard’s first president. Additionally, Dunster was one of the first Houses ever built. During the renovation process it was important to the University to keep the outside looking as it did when it was first built. According to Johns, this endeavor was successful. Not only is Dunster one of the most newly renovated Houses but it’s also one of the oldest, in terms of its rich history.

We know what you’ve been waiting for. So, what’s the deal with the goat?
Dunster hosts an annual “Goat Roast” in their courtyard. They literally roast a goat. It’s unclear why or how this tradition started, but there’s a lot of fanfare, good food, and probably bouncy houses. Johns points to it as one of his favorite Dunster memories, and says it’s a great way for newly-sorted freshmen to meet other members of the House.
Besides explaining the "Goat Roast" ordeal, Johns clued us in on some other lesser-known Dunster details:
Does Dunster have any pets?
MJ: My tutor has a cat…We have a lot of kids! It feels more familial and it’s fun to have kids around.
Any fun facts?
MJ: I think the [Dunster] tower is the most photographed spot in Cambridge.
Closing thoughts?
MJ: I think we have the most gorgeous dining hall in the school, and we have a really great community, and we’ll be really excited for whatever freshmen come our way in March.

Represented by the ever-copulating rabbit, it’s no wonder that Leverett is the House with the largest population. When Leverites aren’t snacking on their famous homemade monkey bread, you can usually find them pset-ing with other students who frequent Leverett for their physics and math nights. Even if you don’t end up being housed in Lev, you’re going to want to know the essential details. Chances are, you’ll find yourself in this sleek River House more often than not.

Because of its large student population, Leverett offers a wide variety of buildings and room layouts to choose from. Residents are split between the Towers (two apartment-esque buildings overlooking the Charles River in a separate courtyard from the House proper), the recently-renovated McKinlock Hall, and DeWolfe St. apartments. Its proximity to the Charles means that some suites in Leverett can enjoy breathtaking sunsets over everyone’s favorite river. Are you ready for an Instagram feed full of #views?

But if all that doesn’t endear you to the House, then know this: Lev is unique in that it allows its rising sophomores to pick their rooms before leaving for the summer, as opposed to some Houses which randomly assign sophomore blocking groups into housing. In an case, if you prefer spacious common rooms and comfy suites, then housing won’t be an issue for you if your future is in Leverett House.
You won’t have to worry about finding friends in Lev: probability is in your favor. This House truly prides itself on catering to its size with its multitude of social spaces, and its connection to DeWolfe. Leverites never have to stress about space when they have the Library Theater to study in, McKinlock to chill in, or the G-Hutch to unwind in.

According to HoCo co-chair Ben I. Sorkin ’20, Leverett, with its courtyard and spacious seminar space known as the light-court, is an open House that truly facilitates a warm community of socializing and bonding.
In the words of HoCo co-chair Steffan B. Paul ’19, Leverett is a “cute” community. There are always new faces to bump into, whether it’s on the elevator or in the wide, spacious dining hall that doubles as a large common space for all residents—and even non-residents. Leverett is a hub of social activity among the River Houses due to its math and physics nights, when students get together to complete psets in Lev’s dining hall.

This year, Leverett is undergoing a change in its Faculty Deans, so there’s potential for new traditions and customs. Historically, Lev is famous for its homemade monkey bread recipe and Spring Formal, but the House is planning some exciting new events, including a new party, Down the Rabbit Hole.

If you’re still unsure about what Leverett has to offer, fear not. We made sure to ask the HoCo chairs any burning questions that are sure to make you excited for your future home:
What would you say is the biggest misconception about your House?
SP: Sometimes, people like to throw around that Leverett doesn’t have a community because it’s so large, and I think that’s something that we really work to create. I do think there’s a lot of community, and I think there’s a lot of work put in to create it. Sometimes it’s hard to access it if you live in a different building from everybody else, but there will be people trying to hang out with you and be friendly with you every step of the way.
BS: I think a misconception that I had about Lev was that it’s hard to find a home here. I think that if you really put yourself out there and try to meet one new person in the dining hall, one new person in the elevator on the way up...people in the House are really friendly and outgoing and want to make this place a home.
If you could change one thing about Lev, what would it be and why?
SP: I would change our tray return system.
BS: Yes.
SP: For some gosh-darn reason, the tray return alcove is so narrow—
BS: It [allows just] one person at a time.
SP: Yeah, that’s just an architectural problem. That has nothing to do with the community, but that would be gold if we could change that.
Any last words to freshmen?
SP: We have a lot of f*cking bunnies. Not bunnies f*cking. Just a lot [of] bunnies.
