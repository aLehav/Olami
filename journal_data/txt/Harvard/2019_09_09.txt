After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From one glance at its cover, Mal Blum’s new album “Pity Boy” appears to be the quintessential Blum album fans have been waiting for. Two figures sit with blankets draped over their heads like ghost costumes without eyeholes. Melting cake, domestic setting, and simple colors create a scene familiar to Blum’s listeners. Much of Blum’s work revolves around break-ups, uncomfortable social situations, and cyclical patterns of self-destructive behavior, tackling themes of anxiety and isolation with a tone of heartfelt sincerity. Blum’s aesthetic of sad butch vulnerability earned them a devoted fanbase of largely queer and counterculture youth. After years of putting out their own work, Blum signed onto Don Giovanni records in 2014, and in 2018, toured with the live show of “Welcome to Nightvale,” an eerily comedic podcast with a cult following perfect for Blum’s clever lyrics and DIY aesthetic. Recently, Blum’s audience has grown even further. “Pity Boy” is their first Billboard-charting record, highlighting Blum’s emergence into today’s punk cannon.
The new album marks a shift for Blum, trading the folk feeling of their earlier work for a solid punk rock sound. The opening song, “Things Still Left to Say,” highlights this shift in tone, kicking off the album with an upbeat tempo and a heavy emphasis on the electric guitar. Though “Things Still Left to Say” is specifically about being closeted, it more generally sets up the album to be heard in the thematic context of shedding new light on past experiences. Nowhere is this clearer than in lyrics that speak directly to the struggle of establishing boundaries in relationships with others; the choruses of “Not My Job” and “I Don’t Want To” seem to boil over with the frustration lurking beneath the surface of many of Blum’s previous narratives. Likewise, “Did You Get What You Wanted” and “Well, Fuck” channel a confident anger that feels more focused than the winding emotional arcs of Blum’s earlier hits.
However, amid the direct, assertive tone of these songs, Blum still nestles numbers that breathe with quiet vulnerability. “Black Coffee,” the only solo track on the album, features soft guitar and lyrics that gently discuss heartbreak as a continuous and uncertain process — the line “Some words I’ll never try to say” directly carves space for complexity within the unfinished-business attitude set by “Things Still Left To Say.” “Salt Flats” is reminiscent of a lullaby, with its steady, calming rhythm and lines like “You rub salt in my wounds / Then you lick it away” that blend a whimsical sense of wordplay with serious content.
The success of the album lies in its emotional range, and no song highlights this dialogue between tough anger and quiet vulnerability as well as “See Me.” While the title is phrased as an imperative, the chorus repeats the same words over and over within the question “Why can’t they see me?” followed by the assertion “I’m right here.” The tone of the question changes as the song switches between lighter background instrumentals and a heavy punk rock beat in an instant. Likewise, after the self-assured forward momentum of “Gotta Go,” the album’s final song,“Maybe I’ll Wait,” presents a compelling thematic contrast with its careful, reflective lyrics.
While the songs on “Pity Boy” are filled with emotional complexity, many of them are also — to put it simply — bops. Since the album’s release, I’ve continually found myself rocking out to “I Don’t Want To” in front of the bathroom mirror or suddenly itching to dance whenever “Odds” plays on my Spotify shuffle on the train.
On “Pity Boy,” Blum expands their musical range to create a punk rock album that harnesses the strengths of their previous work. Rolling with this new energy, Blum still manages to capture a deep sense of intimacy in their raw voice and direct lyrics. Whatever “things still left to say” Blum might have, we’re listening.

Grab your saddle and giddy up for Lil Nas X’s debut EP. An EP exceeding expectations, on “7,” Lil Nas X manages to explore a diverse range of genres, defining himself as more than just a one-hit-wonder, but as a rising star who is redefining the parameters of country music.
Known for his chart-topping single “Old Town Road,” and its subsequent remixes, such as a remix featuring BTS called “Seoul Town Road,” Lil Nas X claimed the top spot on Billboard’s Top 100 for 19 straight weeks — becoming the longest leading billboard number one hit ever — with his country-rap track, beating out veteran number one chart-toppers including Taylor Swift, Drake, and Ed Sheeran. “Old Town Road,” with its contagious beat and southern twang, tore down conventional ideas of what country music sounds — and looks — like. Defined as “country-trap,” it graduated from a TikTok meme to topping the national Billboard charts, but was subsequently removed in March for not being “country” enough. This led to the holy recreation of the song including country icon Billy Ray Cyrus. If Lil Nas X’s success was surprising, the revival of Billy Ray Cyrus’ relevancy was even more so.
“Old Town Road” rode on the coattails of the yeehaw agenda, while blending two disparate genres. While Lil Nas X made the track with a $30 beat and a Nine Inch Nails-generated banjo riff instrumental, it still feels organic — a natural party pleaser. Short enough for ever-dwindling attention spans, “Old Town Road”’s quirky lyrics make it memorable and easily quotable. It’s meme-worthy and perfect for a generation consumed by internet culture and meme pages. All the fanfare of his lead single aside, would Lil Nas X be able to keep up the momentum of popularity he maintained with “Old Town Road"?
“7” amounts to more than just a scramble to rid Lil Nas X of his one-hit-wonder status — it serves up an entreé with “Old Town Road” as the appetizer. As the title suggests, the EP has seven songs including the “Old Town Road” Billy Ray Cyrus remix. Each song is a standalone hit. All are short, but allow Lil Nas X to flex his talents as a musician with a wide range of depth. We continue to experience the “yee-yee juice” flow with “Rodeo,” on which Lil Nas X cements his excellence in country-trap. The track features a verse by Cardi B, a departure from the style of “Old Town Road.” The song features resonating guitar riffs that one would expect from a Western cowboy movie and is almost “country-trap” enough to be comparable to “Old Town Road,” but lands further on the rap side of the country-trap spectrum that Lil Nas X explores.
“Panini,” a short, bursting synth-pop track with more whistling than actual singing, is not only catchy thanks to its rhymes, but has received a similar amount of attention as “Old Town Road.” “Panini” toes the line of alternative pop and rock, but feels as if it’s an oversaturated version of a Juice WRLD or Travis Scott song, but with the added drum-kick thrown in, it’s impossible not to tap your foot along to the song. While “Panini” doesn’t fill the role as a rock song, Lil Nas X exhibits his aptitude for rock in other songs throughout the EP. Travis Baker of Blink-182 and Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic produced “F9mily (You & Me)” and “Bring U Down,” respectively, thus demonstrating the industry’s recognition of Lil Nas X’s capacity for rock music and willingness to catapult him to higher levels of music production. While the musician’s vocals are akin to those of grunge rockers, the tracks showcase his adaptability and refusal to be confined to a single genre.
Lil Nas X attempts to embrace an edgier persona in “Kick It,” a smooth track complimented by brass and drums. “Kick It” distinguishes itself as a one-of-a-kind track on “7,” strengthening his foothold in mainstream hip-hop relative to songs that seek to stand out in other genres. Rounding out the EP is “C7osure (You Like),” it’s bound to please as an alternative pop track. The track’s length is unfortunate — it’s far too short — but its mix of soothing piano chords and calming vocals make it nontheless enjoyable. This track in particular and the EP at large served as a platform for Lil Nas X to come out as gay to his fans. While Lil Nas X tweeted that he thought he made it clear with the EP’s cover art, he elaborates more in “C7osure” as he sings “Ain't no more actin’, man, that forecast say I should just let me grow,” and “this is what I gotta do, can't be regrettin’ when I'm old.”
The EP manages to set Lil Nas X apart from the country blend of “Old Town Road” by incorporating an amalgamation of alt-rock, punk grudge, and rap. While the EP doesn’t necessarily define what kind of artist he plans on being, at his age and place in his career, it doesn’t need to. It’s clear he doesn’t plan on being defined by any singular category. “7” stands out as a charming conglomerate of songs, an uplifting platform that solidifies Lil Nas X’s status as a breakout star of the next generation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the reality of President Donald Trump’s election, a divisive separation opened between two sides of American society, whereby extensive bashing of political opinions and disregard for rational discussion ensued. As two liberals living in America, in our experience this disregard is primarily directed at conservative Americans or conservative belief systems. In our view, this disregard has always existed, but its effect has been amplified as politics becomes more divisive than ever before.
The realities of such a situation are no less present at Harvard. In dorm entryways, at campus protests, from friends and teaching fellows and professors. In all these spaces, constantly, conservative opinions are misunderstood or even mocked. Witnessing this relentless political criticism becomes tiresome, with many of the most vocal critics being misinformed or simply joining a perceived anti-conservatism.
With a lack of conservative opinion on campus, commonly perpetuated liberal beliefs are reaffirmed by many, establishing perpetual criticism without opposition. With a self-proclaimed mission of “educating the citizens and citizen-leaders of our society,” the atmosphere at Harvard must promote multiple perspectives in order for this education to be truly valuable.
As controversial as this may seem, that includes conservative thought. Students here should be amenable to considering the political beliefs of others, even if entirely opposite their own, or in the direction of conservatism. Students must understand that refusing to consider opposing viewpoints runs directly counter to Harvard’s mission and the self-proclaimed open-mindedness that many students tout. By outright rejecting opposing viewpoints, these liberal students are no different from some of the more “close-minded” conservatives they deplore.
Neither of us arrived at Harvard maintaining conservative positions. However, after establishing deep friendships with conservatives, we’ve had the opportunity to learn from and consider their opinions. This is an experience that we are fortunate enough to have experienced. Before arriving in Cambridge, our communities, teachers, families, and friends were mostly liberal.
In our respective predominantly conservative states, our social communities acted as self-proclaimed liberal “safe-havens.” As a result, we never experienced much contact with nor heard the beliefs of conservatives. Because of this lack of exposure to contrasting viewpoints, we became misinformed about opposing perspectives. We had been told that conservatives held certain adverse qualities. Upon coming to Harvard, we expected the campus to be dominated by negative remarks about Republicans and continuous declaration in opposition to the president. And this has mostly held true.
However, the conservatives we’ve met here have taught us a lesson that many others should heed: Don’t disregard contrasting beliefs for the basic nature of their existence. Doing so results in a shielded perception of the world. Harvard claims to desire a diverse body of students, but can that goal truly be accomplished if the class isn’t well-represented politically or ideologically?
While there are certainly students at Harvard who maintain open-mindedness, there persists a strong tendency to dismiss conflicting perspectives. As a result, those few conservatives often feel as though they have to hide their beliefs at an institution that supposedly encourages open political dialogue. This directly contradicts Harvard’s mission of free thought and open dialogue.
Our opinions have generally not changed, but listening to the ideas of our conservative friends has allowed for a greater understanding of contemporary society. We are able to better understand the intricacies of the differences between our own liberal arguments and those of our conservative friends and peers.
The open-mindedness of truly listening to and understanding conservative thought is a practice that many liberals believe they follow, but in actuality rarely practice. By considering the reasoning of those with differing political opinions, students’ arguments can become strengthened as they understand and are able to dissect opposing angles. Some may even change their own stances — which, at such a critical point for personal development, is ideal.
At Harvard, students must remain wary of becoming ensnared within the bubble of conservative criticism. To avoid such a trap requires a willingness to listen to and hear political opinions different from one’s own. All too often, we find comfort in surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals, excluding the opportunity of expanding awareness in other schools of thought. By instead opening ourselves to opposing political thought, we may all learn and benefit from a profound diversity of thought Harvard should encourage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Number 13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?”
I read the question out loud from the New York Times’ “36 Questions That Lead to Love,” as a bonding exercise for our small group of leaders. As we prepared to welcome freshmen to campus, some of us prepared to enter our last year of college. Reality was hitting that we were now seniors and we’d have to figure out post-grad plans.
I looked around the group to see if anybody else had an answer. I knew mine immediately, but I had to think about how to accurately phrase it. A few others responded before I gave my answer.
“I would want to know when I’ll no longer be undocumented.”
The first thought that came to my mind was when I would get my green card but I held off on saying that because I honestly don't know if I ever will get a green card or a path to citizenship. No longer being undocumented for me could mean a path to citizenship, but it could also mean leaving the United States, either willingly or forcibly, due to inhumane immigration policies or continued inaction.
“Do you think you would do things differently if you knew?” My co-leader followed up with her own question.
“Yea,” the question caught me off guard because it opened up what paths I might take if I had the privilege of more stability in this country and the possibility to leave knowing I’d be able to return. “I think it would help me form a plan for graduate school and could give me a better idea if I could do something with international studies.”
I thought more about what even knowing would mean. It would provide a sliver of stability because nothing is guaranteed.
***
One of the first things I learned to do when looking for scholarships, jobs, fellowships, etc. was to find the section for eligibility requirements. That’s how I knew if I should even bother reading the rest of the ad or website. I had to make sure I qualified first — before I got my hopes up, before I got too excited about the opportunity.
When you’re undocumented you put up your own walls to daily conversations that remind you of what you can’t do. Put your walls up to friends’ vacations or trips abroad. Train yourself to respond without showing too much emotion when people ask you if you’ve been back to visit your home country since you came. Keep a smile on your face when they find out where you’re from and try to connect with you by telling you about the time they visited the country you can’t go back to.
At Harvard, it means being met with constant advertising for studying abroad. It means not knowing what to respond when asked if you’d like to register to vote. It means hearing about all the great things your friends are applying for that you convince yourself you weren’t interested in anyway. It means people assuming every door will be open for you once you get your diploma. But you can’t find the door. You don’t see an opening. All you see is a wall.
My undocumented community has thrived in this country with the scraps that we have worked so hard for. We find ways to survive and take our lives into our own hands. We learn to find a home in our liminality. We find ways to take control when everything feels so out of control. This is our reality that often feels very lonely and hopeless.
The future remains unknown. My future is still uncertain as I feel the pressures around me to have a plan for what to do after I graduate. Time is ticking for seniors everywhere, but the anxiety about the future hits differently for us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, an incoming student’s arrival at Harvard College was put in jeopardy when United States border officials denied him entry into the country. Despite having applied for and secured the necessary and proper permissions to enter the country, his visa was cancelled.
The student — Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23 — has fortunately since arrived on campus. Ajjawi received legal aid from Harvard’s immigration lawyers and non-profit organization AMIDEAST. His story also sparked outcry from Harvard affiliates and the attention of the international media.
But Ajjawi is by no means the only student whose ability to study has been impeded by restrictive immigration policies. It’s important to remain conscious of the many students whose international and undocumented status limits their ability to work and learn in our country and on our campus.
Concerns about their immigration status weigh heavily on the minds of students around the country. Across the U.S. there are over a million international students and thousands of undocumented students, every one of whom — and some more than others — live with the knowledge that at any moment, they or their families could have their place in this country taken away. This fear is corrosive, fundamentally detracting from their ability to learn and to contribute to their campuses.
Non-citizen students undergo the same admissions processes and meet the same standards their peers do. Yet they are faced with a burden of uncertainty their peers can never understand. In the case of undocumented students, this uncertainty extends beyond their immigration status — it implicates the future and security of themselves, their families, and their communities. Day in and day out, many students are burdened by the possibility that they will not be allowed to arrive in the U.S. or return home.
Indeed, the number of international students is declining, as U.S. policy becomes less open to their presence. For example, a policy memorandum issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service in August 2018 threatened to restrict the future of international students by changing the way in which “unlawful presence” is calculated, though a judge issued a temporary injunction on the order in May. At the same time, the Trump administration continues to threaten the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, leaving young undocumented students in a state of vulnerability and uncertainty.
It is important to recognize that the widespread and proactive response the incoming freshman received just last week hinged largely on the fact that he was admitted to a prominent university like Harvard. Across the country, many other international students and undocumented students in less public circumstances will face the same challenges, but may not be afforded such support.
Moreover, the xenophobia and Islamophobia potentially at the root of the student’s deportation does not vanish with his arrival. Though officials gave no reason for his deportation, the act is indicative of a broader culture of prejudice against Muslim and Middle Eastern individuals that has arisen, leaving many in fear. We must remain critical of the anti-immigrant rhetoric and public policies perpetrated by the Trump administration, and work to promote its end.
We praise Harvard for its swift defense of this student and its continued vocal acknowledgement that the Trump administration’s immigration policy is a detriment to scholarly excellence and intellectual freedom. But more work and action is needed. We call on Harvard’s leadership to work harder to create a positive and safe space for international and undocumented students, and to continue to push for public policy that creates a more open and welcoming country. That’s not only paramount for the production of globally rooted knowledge, but also for Harvard’s leadership in creating a more ethical world.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council voted to establish a Social Inclusion Grant — a central part of the platform advanced by President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 — at its first meeting of the academic year Sunday.
Sunday’s meeting was the last of the UC’s 2018-19 session; the UC’s attention will now turn toward the process of electing new representatives.
With the creation of the Social Inclusion Grant, students and student organizations will be able to apply to host “socially-inclusive” events and parties with UC financial backing.
Each week, the UC will fund one event thrown by a student organization and another by an individual student, giving preference to applicants that have received Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention training and organizations with limited funds.
The Council allocated $7,500 to support the grant for the Fall semester. Individual grants may be used to fund alcohol, as long as signs reading “21+ only” are present and at least 25 percent of the funding is used on non-alcoholic purchases.
Some council members shared concerns about permitting the funds to be spent on alcohol purchases.
“I think there are people on this campus who are religiously opposed to going to parties or drinking alcohol. In that situation, we shouldn’t be using a stockpile of their money for supplying things that they don’t religiously agree with,” said UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, a former Crimson Sports Chair.
Palaniappan noted that money from the student activities fee — an optional annual sum attached to tuition payments — is already used to fund House committee purchases of alcoholic beverages for steins and other House events.
In addition, Quincy House representative Rushi A. Patel ’21 said the UC had precedent for using its budget to fund events that some students on campus did not support.
“For example, the events that [Palestinian Solidarity Committee] held, there was an entire segment of the student population that did not like the event, but we funded it,” Patel said.
In April, the UC allocated $2,050 from its Grant for an Open Harvard College to fund the PSC’s Israeli Apartheid Week, an event that drew criticism from some cultural and religious groups on campus.
Beyond the Social Inclusion Grant, Palaniappan and Huesa sponsored two of the other four bills proposed at Sunday’s meeting, despite the fact that their ability to sponsor legislation remains ambiguous.
Last semester, some representatives questioned whether the president and vice president had the power to vote and sponsor legislation because of an ambiguity in the UC’s constitution.
At its last spring meeting, the council voted to establish a new committee with the power to interpret the constitution. That committee decided to strip the president and vice president of their voting rights and ability to sponsor legislation.
Enough representatives changed their votes after the meeting, however, to nullify the committee’s establishment, leaving the president’s and vice president’s powers in the council uncertain.
UC members voted Sunday to allow the duo to temporarily vote and sponsor legislation.

Meghan Lockwood will serve as interim resident dean of Elm Yard, College administrators announced in an email to freshmen Friday.
Lockwood — who has previously served as interim resident dean for Adams, Quincy, and Winthrop Houses — will be taking over for Elm Yard’s current resident dean Jasmine M. Waddell when Waddell steps down Sept. 13.
Lockwood will be one of four freshmen resident deans working under the First-Year Experience Office, a division of the Dean of Students Office that oversees housing and campus life for freshmen.
Nekesa C. Straker, senior assistant dean of residential life and first-year students, wrote in her email to freshmen Friday that Lockwood has a “depth of experience” at Harvard. Lockwood previously served as a resident tutor in Adams House from 2009 to 2015 and earned a doctorate from the Graduate School of Education in 2017.
“I’m looking forward to working with students in Elm Yard and being part of the team in the First-Year Experience Office,” Lockwood wrote in an email Sunday.
Straker wrote Friday that Waddell will be transitioning to an administrative role in the Office for Faculty Affairs — a division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that oversees support and trainings for faculty and researchers. Waddell will specifically work at the Office for Faculty Development, a branch of the OFA.
Straker also wrote that Waddell, who has served as Elm Yard’s resident dean since 2013, has been a “model and inspiration for her colleagues” throughout her career at the FYE.
Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05, assistant director of the Advising Programs Office, also notified Peer Advising Fellows — a group of upperclassmen who mentor freshmen — of Waddell’s departure in an email Friday. Lambert-Sluder wrote that Elm Yard will be in “wonderful hands” when Lockwood assumes her interim role.
“Dean Waddell advocated for students and fostered a Yard identity among three distinct dorms – Matthews, Grays, and Weld – perhaps because she’s always insisted on adding ‘the best Yard’ to any description of Elm,” Lambert-Sluder wrote.
Waddell did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black Ink, the stationery store that has furnished Cambridge residents with greeting cards, art supplies and decorations for almost two decades, is set to leave its Brattle Street location by the end of the year.
Black Ink’s impending departure —a result of rising rent prices — has set off a wave of criticism against the North Carolina-based development company Asana Partners, which owns the property. The closing comes at a time of extensive commercial turnover in the Square; Urban Outfitters, Crema Cafe, and Chipotle, among others, have all closed their doors in the past year.
Susan L. Corcoran, who founded Black Ink with her late husband in 1994, said she had difficulty negotiating rent prices with Asana Partners. She alleged that Asana representatives were difficult to contact throughout the negotiation process and that she had to hire a lawyer. Her lawyer eventually told her that Asana would only accept a rent price she believed was “unsustainable.”
Representatives of Asana could not be reached for comment.
Ahead of its closing, Black Ink has launched a feedback-based project called “Dear Asana Partners” which has garnered dozens of comments from local residents lamenting the loss of Black Ink and other former Square businesses. Store workers placed large sheets of paper in the shop and invited customers to share their thoughts on Asana and the commercial turnover in the Square.
“Harvard Square is now a ghost town,” reads one message.
Another charges that Asana Partners is responsible for “destroying the neighborhood.”
One message signed by “Laurence, Cambridge” pleads, “Please realize that this store is important to the/our community! One more empty commercial space helps no-one!”
When Black Ink closes its doors in December, it will be one of more than 11 businesses to leave the Square this year.
Customers have also used the project as an opportunity to vent their frustration with Cambridge city officials. One message scrawled on the corner of the sheet of paper reads, the “Cambridge City Government has failed us.”
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern said the city is likewise concerned about the impact of commercial turnover.
“I know that the Cambridge City Council and the city of Cambridge is very concerned about what’s happening to small businesses and local businesses — rents are through the roof and it’s pushing places like Black Ink out,” McGovern said.
The Cambridge City Council ultimately cannot intervene in property transactions as it cannot tell a property owner how much to charge for rent, according to McGovern. But McGovern criticized Asana’s approach to their real-estate decisions, stating that those decisions could impact the future relationship between Asana and the Cambridge City government.
“[Asana] gave a lot of lip service to what good neighbors they were going to be and how they were going to support local businesses. They haven’t done that, and it’s been frustrating — I’m very upset about that,” McGovern said. “I have no intention of supporting an organization or a company that doesn’t support the local community.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that more than 70 percent of businesses in the Square are independent businesses.
She added that HSBA is limited in its power to intervene with commercial turnover.
“We can’t tell [Asana] what to do, we can only strongly suggest that there are things that are important to us in Harvard Square and certainly maintaining a district that is unique is part of the draw and part of the experience,” Jillson said.
Corcoran said she plans to continue gathering community input via her feedback project. Several local residents have said they will miss the store once it closes, though its Beacon Hill location will remain open.
Lilly T. Grossman, a Boston resident and a pediatric neurologist, said the toys sold by Black Ink are helpful for her work.
“The quality of children’s toys here is superior in that they are simpler and made out of wood,” Grossman said. “That’s important for kids’ development.”
Corcoran said she will eventually present to Asana Partners the community grievances she gathered as part of her project. She said the project is an expression of “anger, disbelief” and a means of expression for people who “feel like they’ve lost control of their community.”
“The community did not feel heard or represented,” said Corcoran.

When Angela Q. Crispi, the Harvard Business School executive dean for administration, had her first child, then-Business School Dean John H. McArthur arrived at her house with a present: a Polaroid camera.
“I remember him saying that being a parent was so important and every parent wants to take pictures of their child and all he wanted to do was drop that off,” said Crispi.
McArthur’s gift was yet another personal touch in a career defined by close relationships with faculty, students, and administrators. McArthur — who served as dean of the Business School from 1979 to 1995 and engineered the creation of the Partners Healthcare network, which transformed healthcare administration in Boston — died on Aug. 20. He was 85.
Even after retiring from his position at the Business School, McArthur remained active, serving on a number of corporate boards and acting as a patron to the arts. He also served as an adviser to the president of the World Bank.
Current Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohira wrote in an emailed statement that McArthur was a dedicated leader who made significant contributions to the school.
“John’s vision, passion, and unparalleled gift for building consensus transformed the School,” wrote Nohria. “He cared deeply about every member of the HBS community and believed in the School’s ability to transform lives. By encouraging us all to dream big dreams — in effect, spurring our intellectual ambition — he set the School on a remarkable trajectory.”
McArthur, who was born in Vancouver, Canada and grew up in a nearby suburb, received an MBA from the Business School in 1959 and a Doctorate in Business Administration in 1963. He began teaching at the Business School while he was a graduate student and became dean at the age of 46.
As dean, McArthur oversaw the physical transformation of the Business School’s campus, including the construction of three new buildings and 16 renovation projects. During McArthur’s tenure, members of his graduating class donated the Class of 1959 chapel — a fixture of the Business School’s campus. McArthur Hall, a residential hall on campus, was also named after him.
While serving as dean, McArthur became known for sending handwritten notes to faculty, staff, and students, offering praise for academic and professional success and thanks for their hard work.
“He was both incredibly smart, a visionary, but really an incredible leader from the standpoint of being so caring and genuine with people,” Crispi said.
McArthur also played a key role in the creation of the Partners Healthcare system, the physician network that merges Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Mass General Hospital. He served as the founding chairman of Partners before retiring in 1996.
Ron M. Walls, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, called McArthur “a mentor and advisor…without peer.”
Walls recalled how McArthur, who formerly served as the chair of the board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, could find resolutions when other board members struggled with an issue.
“When the time was just right, and John’s sense of persuasive timing was unmatched, he would lean forward in his chair, and in a low, unemotional tone, ask the question. He often began his comments with ‘It seems to me that,’ or ‘What I am hearing is that’ and he would fold this into a question that invariably went right to the heart of the matter,” Walls wrote.
“Invariably, a light bulb would go on for all, or most, in the room, and the issue would move quickly to resolution, without any further commentary or coaching from John,” Walls added.
Crispi said the length of McArthur’s tenure is a testament to the impact that Harvard had on his life as well as the impact that he had on Harvard.
“I’m very mindful with him that he came to Harvard when he was 23 years old, and then he stayed for 60 years,” Crispi said. “The institution shaped him and then he helped to shape it.”
McArthur is survived by his wife, as well as his two daughters, his brother, and his four grandchildren.
A memorial service for McArthur will be held in Memorial Church on Oct. 30 at 2 p.m with a reception at the Business School to follow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council’s proposed affordable housing overlay has taken center-stage on its agenda in recent months, but as the 2019 election draws near, some candidates are not impressed with the plan.
The citywide zoning overlay — which promises to be a cornerstone issue across campaigns — was introduced before the council in early 2019. It is designed to combat a housing crisis that continues to rank as residents’ number one concern in Cambridge’s biannual surveys.
The zoning overlay would enable affordable housing developers to compete with market rates by streamlining the permitting process for units that are deemed 100 percent affordable. The city defines affordable housing as units for which residents do not have to pay more than 30 percent of their income on rent or a mortgage.
The overlay also incentivizes developing housing units that follow preferred dimensional standards with regard to height, open space, and the distance between buildings and property lines. Implementation would facilitate construction of a greater number of multi-family and townhouse units.
City Council candidate John Pitkin is one of several candidates, however, who harbor reservations. Pitkin said in an interview that he agrees with the purpose of the overlay, but aspects of the proposal — such as eliminating development reviews by the city Planning Board — concern him.
“This changes it in too many ways, too abruptly,” he said. “I think there are many things that could be done to improve the supply of housing, not necessarily specifically affordable housing. At a minimum, this needs more work than the Council has been able to do.”
City Council challenger Derek A. Kopon — who works at Harvard’s astrophysics center — was also unconvinced that the overlay was the best way to address housing in Cambridge. Among his concerns is the overlay’s timeline, which he described as “rushed.” He also said the overlay fails to adequately address the impact that it would have on the environment, specifically the city’s tree canopy.
“Right now, the overlay proposal has no protections at all for trees,” he said. “This proposal could have a devastating impact on the tree canopy, and that's something we should really be trying to protect.”
The City Council has previously sought to deal with the tree canopy loss, most recently passing legislation to achieve this goal in February.
Over the summer, the city hosted a series of drop-in sessions, along with two public hearings, to discuss questions and concerns about the overlay. The next ordinance committee meeting regarding the zoning proposal is set to take place Sept. 10.
Candidate and former Cambridge School Committee member Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 said in a summer City Council meeting that the housing overlay was not sufficiently researched. She added that more alternatives should have been considered, and that the lack of further analysis was “irresponsible.”
“Good governance and good management requires a clear process for assessing options for any kind of issue like affordable housing,” she said. “I see no evidence that this best practice was used.”
Other candidates, including Jeffrey McNary, spurn the housing overlay in favor of alternative policies that are better tailored to Cambridge and its particular needs. He also said he considers the proposal “exotic.”
“We just don't see that as good public policy at this point. It could be refreshed,” he said. “It could be a teachable moment for a lot of us, you know, myself included, and other players here. But I think that there are other more direct and immediate routes that can be taken.”
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, a fervent advocate of the overlay, defended it in a July interview.
“The housing overlay is a key initiative, I think that we have to make it easier to finance affordable housing projects,” he said. “I understand that that makes people nervous and change is difficult. But again, it's about priorities and keeping Cambridge a diverse city, making sure that people with lower incomes can still live here has always been my priority, and that doesn't come without some degree of sacrifice and change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women’s volleyball opened its season hosting the Harvard Invitational, as Colgate, Rhode Island, and Sacred Heart made their way to Cambridge for the weekend. The Crimson returned 11 letterwinners to the squad, looking to bring an experienced mentality to games and mentor the four freshmen joining the team. While the squad hit a stumbling block against Colgate, it bookended the season’s first loss with wins.
HARVARD 3, RHODE ISLAND 1
Looking to bounce back from its first loss of the season, Harvard faced off against Rhode Island (1-5), a team which had yet to find a win in the invitational.
A back-and-forth first set saw both teams hitting above .300 with the Crimson recording 18 kills and the Rams tallying 14. Coming down to a score of 23-23, Rhode Island edged out the set win, taking a 1-0 lead in the match.
Yet the story of the weekend for Harvard has been the response to a set loss. Once again, the squad rallied back to win not only the second set, but the next two as well to end the match in four. The Crimson recorded at least 14 kills and a .300 percentage in all four sets of the match, displaying its dominance over Rhode Island in the final game of the invitational.
As she had all weekend, junior Sandra Zeng led the team in digs with 14, helping her earn all-tournament team honors. Senior Sope Adeleye’s 12-kill game solidified her all-tournament team selection. In the final match of the weekend, freshman Ava Rauser led the team in blocks with seven and junior co-captain Evelyn Gray led in kills with 13.
HARVARD 1, COLGATE 3
Colgate (5-1) entered the match seeking to extend its three-game win streak against Harvard. Both teams came out strong, combining for 30 kills in the first set, which was separated by four points in Colgate’s favor. Both teams hit over .400, percentages not repeated for the error-plagued remainder of the game.
The Crimson found itself down two sets to none going into the third. With its back against the wall again, the squad was able to put on a dominant performance, holding Colgate to a .000 percentage and tallying 14 kills against the Patriots.
However, the third set’s surge was not enough, as Colgate bounced back to finish the job and win the fourth set. The Patriots’ .252 hitting percentage and 55 digs in the match propelled them past Harvard’s .183 percentage and 38 digs.
Despite the loss, several players put on good performances. Zeng led the team in digs again with 12. Gray recorded a career-high in kills with 14, and Adeleye tallied seven blocks, showing the same defensive impact as the day before.
HARVARD 3, SACRED HEART 2
The Crimson began its season facing off against Sacred Heart (2-4), which came into the Harvard Invitational following a 1-2 outing in the previous weekend, when the Pioneers travelled to the nation’s capital to play in the Georgetown Invitational.
Harvard came out hot against the Northeast Conference preseason favorites, securing a victory in the first set after hitting .282. Sacred Heart quickly responded, however, winning the next two sets while hitting .290 and .424, respectively. The Pioneers combined for 34 kills during the second and third sets, quickly slowing the Crimson’s roll.
Facing a loss in the match, Harvard quickly rallied back. Led by Adeleye’s 14-kill performance — both a team and career high — the Crimson won the next set to force a decisive fifth. Tallying 12 kills and hitting .455 while holding Sacred Heart to a whopping .000 hitting percentage, Harvard won the fourth 25-12. In the final set, the Pioneers were held to hitting .100, where they lost by two points to drop the match.
Alongside an impressive performance from Adeleye, freshman Ashley Wang added 22 helpers and Zeng led the way with 12 digs. The squad left the first night of the tournament victorious.
Looking forward to the next weekend, the Crimson will be travelling to the West Coast for the UC Santa Barbara Invitational, facing La Salle, San Diego, and the host, UCSB.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time this decade, the Harvard field hockey team’s first two games of the season came against two top-25 opponents. The Crimson (1-1, 0-0 Ivy) emerged victorious from a hard-fought season-opener against No. 22 Albany that required extra time to determine a winner, before falling to No. 4 UConn two days later after giving up a trio of goals in the first half.
“After last year, we wanted to have a tougher schedule [and] have more challenges for ourselves,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “I think that is exactly what we got this weekend.”
The Crimson is coming off a record-breaking season, which included a program-high 14-game win streak on the way to a program-best ranking of sixth in the nation and its first ever NCAA Quarterfinal game.
Harvard still had some rust to shake off, though — rust that opponents have already had time to work on. Albany came into its matchup against the Crimson with two official games and two exhibition matches under its belt; UConn entered with three games — all wins, all against top-25 opponents.
HARVARD 0, UCONN 3
After a nail-biting win in Albany, Harvard traveled cross-border to face No. 4 UConn (4-0, 0-0 Big East), a perennial NCAA tournament team that, although less world-renowned than the same school’s women’s basketball team, has also won three national championships in the past six years.
“We started off really well,” captain Bente van Vlijmen said. “We had our front set up really well, and we were very dominant, and then we let [in] a kind of stupid goal against us. I think that ripped us apart a little bit, and we weren’t really playing as a unit anymore.”
Fifteen minutes after that initial goal in the second minute of play, a pair of scores only five minutes apart dug Harvard even deeper into the hole. Then, the digging stopped.
The Crimson matched the Huskies for shots in the remaining 35 minutes, and although Harvard was unable to find the net in its four shots on goal, UConn was also held scoreless.
“I think we played a lot better in the second half, and that’s because in the second half...we told each other, ‘Guys, this is not a league game, we have nothing to lose, this is a top four program,’” van Vlijmen said. “It didn’t seem like we wanted to score, that we wanted to win — and after we had that talk... we played a lot better, we just couldn’t get it in the goal cage.”
HARVARD 2, ALBANY 1 (OT)
The Crimson opened the season against a top-25 opponent, offering no opportunity to ease into its first competition since last November’s NCAA Quarterfinal exit against Princeton.
Albany (1-2, 0-0 American East) is a team rightfully renowned for its defense — the Great Danes allowed 12 goals over the 2018 regular season, only twice yielding more than one score. played with tremendous defensive pressure for the whole of the game.
Albany (1-2, 0-0 American East) played with tremendous defensive pressure for the whole of the game. The Great Danes allowed 12 goals over the 2018 regular season, only twice yielding more than one score.
“When you look at Albany…they have one of the best goalkeepers in the NCAA,” van Herwaarden said. “They are really good on defense, so you know you’re not going to get that many chances.”
After going down at the tail end of the first half after the Great Danes’ third shot of the match found its mark, the Crimson resolved to step up its game.
“We were like, ‘[Are] we gonna really lose our first game?’” Harvard captain Bente van Vlijmen said. “Then, in the second half, we really start fighting.”
Nine shots into the second half, the Crimson got its chance. A penalty corner for Harvard saw the ball find sophomore midfielder Kiley Allen, who passed to sophomore forward Rachel Greenwood and sent it home. The game was tied.
The remaining eight minutes of regulation played out with only one shot per side, and the match headed to overtime. Three minutes later, another Crimson penalty corner. Senior forward Casey Allen passed to junior back Hannah Pearce, who struck true for the game-winner.
“You need to trust your attack… 17 shots, I believe, 12 on goal — and eventually they fell,” van Herwaarden said.
Harvard returns to play for its home opener on September 12 at 4 p.m. against No. 21 Stanford, its third-consecutive game against a ranked opponent.
“It’s another non-league game,” van Vlijmen said. “We always expect to play well against them, because we absolutely love playing against teams like that, but I can’t tell you if we’re going to win or not… We really need to stick to our plan and try to get that first goal so we can dominate the game instead of our opponents. I think that’s something we’re going to focus on.”
In the meantime, the Crimson has some strategies to adjust, and some positives to hold the same.
“One of the big things is starting that first half with a lot of energy — playing it how we want to play it, not so much how our opponent wants to play it,” van Vlijmen said. “I think we need to respect ourselves more and give ourselves the confidence to play our own game in the first half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a dominating win against Quinnipiac in its season opener, the Harvard women’s rugby team suffered a decisive loss against Army West Point on Saturday, falling 34-10.
Though the Crimson (1-1) controlled the tempo for the first ten minutes with multiple opportunities for a try, Harvard came up short and the Black Knights (1-0) scored the first two tries of the game to make the score 10-0. Shortly after, Army scored two penalty picks to further extend its lead by six points.
“It was definitely a very physical game. We knew that going into it. We started out pretty strong in the first few minutes, but we just had a hard time simply playing our style of play,” said co-captain Emily Prentice. “Army is a very tough and physical team, and we ended up getting behind early on so we had to keep fighting to try to get back in it throughout the whole game.”
The Crimson eventually did respond with senior Virgina Miller’s first try of the season, which made the score 16-5. However, this hopeful Crimson momentum was short lived, halted by another Black Knights try, making the halftime score 21-5.
“We went into the game with the mindset that it was going to be a hard, physical game and that we would take some hard hits,” said co-captain Robyn Beese. “We expected the physicality but did not necessarily adapt.”
Though Harvard continued to fight to get back into the game, Army scored two tries in the beginning of the second half to push its lead to 31-5. Though hopes of a comeback were fairly far fetched at this point, the Crimson did not give up.
“We did a really great job of keeping up the positive chat throughout the game and encouraging one another,” said Beese. “We continued to display confident body language and we maintained positive attitudes even if the game wasn’t going particularly well for us.”
Harvard did maintain its composure after 25 points and eventually came up with a response. Freshman Brogan Mior scored her second try in two games to make the score 31-10. After the Black Knights scored a penalty kick in the final few minutes, the final score came out to be 34-10.
“We graduated eight of our seniors and got eight freshmen to replace them. You can imagine how this shifted the team dynamic. I think this game gave them the intense college rugby experience they’ve never really seen before,” said Beese. “So it was a good learning experience. We will come back stronger.”
Prentice also suggested the intensity of the game will be particularly helpful looking forward.
“I think this was a really valuable game to have early on in the season. It was really good to experience that pressure and have a big challenge of a game,” said Prentice. “It will be really beneficial to see how we are securing our own ball, how we are defending, and how to play under that kind of intense pressure.”
While this game was a tough loss early on in the season, the Crimson will use it to prepare for its first home opener this weekend against Dartmouth, a strong team Harvard has been going back-and-forth with over the past few years.
“We try not to focus on a rivalry with teams and just try to control what we can do. However, we are very good at coming back from a loss, and I think this game will actually really give us the fight we need to beat Dartmouth,” said Beese. “We just need to focus on what we can do and control the controllable.”

We live in turbulent times, and there is no better proof than my.harvard, which can be counted upon to crash at the most inconvenient moments. Last semester Flyby took a peek at Syllabus Explorer and Curricle, two course search (but not registration) sites. Now, Curricle has released a new beta version with upgraded features to help you shop. If you get bad lottery news, it isn’t too late to keep looking! Flyby sat down with members of the Curricle team to learn more about the project and its liberal artsy ethos — and tested out some of those funky new tools.
It’s Called Art
One of the things we noticed immediately and loved about Curricle last semester was the colorful graphics and sharp design. That fancy design is no accident — Curricle is run by metaLAB, which was in turn founded by Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature Professor Jeffrey T. Schnapp, who is also an affiliate at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Talk about interdisciplinary.
“The universe of courses, I think, is probably the most profound, distilled vision of what a university is and what it thinks is important in the world,” Schnapp said. “More than just the immediate practical value … there’s a bigger vision of how we can make information systems do a lot more than just deliver core functionality.”
Search by Learning Style
By far the most immediately useful thing on Curricle is the tool that lets you explore by class type — lecture, seminar, etc. If you prefer to filter out smaller classes because you hate participation (no judgment), there is a way! While my.harvard also has a course component search, you can’t search by seminar and then see what departments offer seminars, for instance, as you can on Curricle.
Exploration, Not Shopping?
While changing the way undergraduates shop classes might sound like a top-down abstract concept (a la the removal of shopping week entirely), Curricle does have input from students. Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program fellows have worked on the project almost every year since its founding, according to Schnapp. The team also welcomes feedback emails throughout the year.
MetaLAB Associate Director Matthew R. Battles says Curricle’s goal is to “integrate and learn from” students’ existing shopping habits and experiences, such as the Google Calendar-style plan tool and the Q Guide, which “some members of the faculty and administration would prefer to pretend don’t exist.” To that end, Curricle now links to Syllabus Explorer and the Q Guide. Project Manager Oliver Luo ’13, said that the new beta version also improves user experience, navigation, and tool explainers based on student feedback.
Not a Competition
The Curricle database is tied into the Registrar’s and not my.harvard’s — which is why, when my.harvard goes down, Curricle stays standing. Of course, you can’t enroll on Curricle, and the team members assure us that they don’t see Curricle as a my.harvard replacement, or competition. In fact, they work alongside the HUIT team behind my.harvard. But there are advantages to having alternatives. Whenever my.harvard does crash, as it is wont to do, the team says Curricle sees a huge jump in traffic.
As for my.harvard, “we’re not wishing that there’s outages,” Schnapp says. “Just to get that straight.”
