After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
Harvard will pause construction of the Allston Science Complex in early spring 2010 after the structure's foundation is completed but before the building would be ready for tenants, according to a letter sent by University President Drew G. Faust to the community early Thursday afternoon. 

The decision was based on the "altered financial landscape of the University, and the wider world," which "necessitates a shift away from rapid development in Allston," according to the letter.
The pause follows Harvard's announcement last February that it would slow construction of the Science Complex while it examined various options and timelines for completing the project. Allston residents criticized the University at the time for halting construction while Harvard-owned properties in Allston sat vacant.
The Allston Science Complex is the first component of Harvard's ambitious 50-year plan to construct a campus across the river and was intended to serve as a hub for stem cell research and interdisciplinary science. Faust's letter wrote that the delay in construction would "in no way slow Harvard's significant momentum in the life sciences."
Even before Thursday's announcement that the slowdown would soon become a halt, construction delays had created difficulties for some Harvard scientists, as it became clear that promised space in Allston would not be ready on schedule. In particular, stem cell researchers who had planned on moving into the Allston Science Complex were instead relocated to the Sherman-Fairchild building in Cambridge, displacing Molecular and Cellular Biology faculty and causing tensions with administrators.
The letter emphasized that that the University would continue its "commitment to a program of active stewardship in Harvard properties." Faust's letter announced a new plan for Harvard's presence in Allston, consisting of three phases—"property stewardship and community engagement; campus planning and greening; and campus development."
The first phase will involve Harvard leasing out 100,000 square feet of its property in Allston that had previously been reserved for "construction support." It will also work to make its properties more attractive by "investing in upgrades and improvements" in the properties it currently owns.
Additionally, the University will extend short-term lease contracts and engage real estate brokers to "reach more potential tenants for Allston properties."   Faust also emphasized that this first phase will also involve the continued development of the University's public service programs in the neighborhood.
The second phase of development in Allston will involve greening the community, through the completion of Library Park--a public park for the neighborhood.
General campus development in Allston, the third and final phase of the new plan, will occur "as resources allow and only after a targeted evaluative process that will begin next month."  The process will be led by a new guided Work Team "with expertise in design, urban planning, business strategy, real estate development, and public policy." The committee will include Peter Tufano, the senior associate dean for Planning and University Affairs at Harvard Business School, Bill Purcell, the head of the Institute of Politics and the former mayor of Nashville, TN, and Alex Krieger, chair of the Department of Urban Planning and Design at the Graduate school of Design.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—This particular victory tastes even sweeter the second time around.
Led by the spectacular play of co-captain Jeremy Lin, Harvard men’s basketball (7-2) traveled to nearby Conte Forum Wednesday night and took advantage of a dominant interior presence to defeat Boston College, 74-67, in a repeat of the Crimson’s stunning upset of the Eagles (6-3) last season.
“I can’t say enough about how these kids have played and the effort that they’ve given,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m very proud of them.”
Several BC players had admitted to experiencing a mental letdown in last January’s loss—which came a few days after a defeat of then-No. 1 North Carolina—and vowed to make amends. For much of the first half, their promise came true.
After missing their first seven shots of the game, the Eagles held their visitors scoreless over a span of eight minutes. BC junior Joe Trapani came out strong, collecting his team’s first 10 points of the game and a total of 17 in the half. His teammates caught fire as well, and the Eagles used a 14-0 run to seize a lead as great as nine.
But history had a way of repeating itself. As was the case a year ago, the best player on the floor wore a jersey reading Harvard on the front and the No. 4 on the back.
Lin, who had 27 points the last time he stepped onto the Conte hardwood, ended the Crimson’s scoring drought with under five minutes to play in the first half, nailing a long three-pointer that he launched just seconds before the shot clock would have expired.
The offensive spark was followed by a series of layups by Harvard’s big men, and the visitors went into the locker room down by only four.
Determined to avoid déjà vu all over again, BC started the second half with a renewed sense of urgency, nabbing multiple offensive rebounds following errant attempts. Forward Corey Raji’s free throw gave the Eagles a 43-36 lead at the 14:35 mark.
But there was still no answer for Lin, who repeatedly worked the ball off a screen and either drove to the basket—accumulating 16 points in the second half—or passed it off to an interior player for an easy score.
“We knew that if we dragged their bigs out, that would open a lot up for us,” Lin said. “We have shooters on the outside that they couldn’t really leave, and we had obviously the big guys who were rolling…we just tried to spread them out and take what they gave us.”
With about eight minutes left in the contest, the star guard spun into the lane, leapt into the air, and handed the ball off to sophomore Keith Wright, who banked in a short shot to cap an 11-0 Harvard spurt.
The main beneficiary of Lin’s playmaking ability, Wright bulldozed his way to 21 points, a career high.
“What Jeremy said to me in the huddle was, ‘If you roll hard, I’m going to find you,’” Wright explained.
The Crimson advantage would hover around six points until the game’s final minute, when BC guard Reggie Jackson cut the deficit to two.
While the Eagles did themselves no favors at the charity stripe—missing eight out of 24 second-half attempts—Lin calmly put the game away with four free throws.
“Our previous game against UConn, we shot 11-for-18 [at the line], so that was something we talked about,” Lin said. “We were just trying to stay focused and knock them down.”
Acknowledging that the rematch against Harvard carried special significance, BC had no explanation for the demoralizing loss—besides the simplest one.
“This year, they beat us,” Eagles coach Al Skinner said. “They executed down the stretch, and we didn’t. That’s the difference…Last year, we did not show up…This year, they’re a good team, they executed their stuff, they did the things they needed to do, and we did not.”
Both Lin and Skinner agreed that the current Crimson squad has improved upon the group that pulled off last year’s upset, which made headlines all over the nation.
“Our team last year—I don’t think we were as good as we were this year,” Lin said. “The freshmen last year, they’re now a year older and are playing with a lot more confidence, and obviously we have a really talented freshman class coming in.”
But the importance of the non-conference victory hasn’t changed at all.
After the clock hit zero, the entire Harvard roster sprinted exuberantly off the court—its most emotional celebration since a dramatic triple-overtime win over William & Mary in the home opener.
“I like the vibe and spirit of our group right now,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—Before entering Wednesday night’s contest against Boston College, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker stressed the importance of keeping the Eagles off the glass.
Mission accomplished.
Battling a team that had outrebounded its opponents in each of its last eight matches, the Crimson managed to win the battle of the boards, outrebounding the Eagles 31 to 30.
“An incredible point of emphasis for us was to try and keep them off the backboard,” Amaker said. “I’m shocked to know that we were able to [outrebound them] because it seemed like every time they shot it, they were going to get it.”
While senior forward Pat Magnarelli and sophomore big man Keith Wright led the way for Harvard with six and four rebounds, respectively, the Crimson needed help from all its players to slow a team that receives most of its rebounding from perimeter men.
Co-captain Jeremy Lin, along with sophomore guard Oliver McNally and freshman Brandyn Curry, chipped in with eight rebounds and held the Eagles’ Reggie Jackson to four, half of his typical output.
Harvard’s dominance down low manifested itself in offensive production as well, where the Crimson outscored the Eagles in the paint 40 to 26. Most of that scoring was done by the 6’8 Wright, who finished with a career-high 21 points.
Three of Wright’s nine baskets came off picks set for Lin, who then dished it to Wright as he rolled to the basket.
“The bigs really weren’t hedging out as hard,” Wright said. “They’re not really good on the ball screens, so what Jeremy said to me in the huddle was, ‘If you roll hard, I’m going to find you.’”
YOUNG TALENT
In a game where Lin and Wright led the Crimson offense with 46 points, a pair of freshmen played subtler roles in the victory.
With his team trailing by five midway through the second period, rookie point guard Curry provided defensive intensity that sparked the Crimson’s comeback.
Following two free throws from classmate Kyle Casey, Curry picked up Eagles point guard Biko Paris in the backcourt and helped force a steal that Lin recovered and brought the other way for a layup that cut the deficit to three.
Two possessions later, Curry’s full court pressure led to a five second violation on the Eagles Reggie Jackson. Lin’s two free throws on the ensuing possession put Harvard within one.
“We were kind of falling into a half court game where things were slowed down, but Brandyn just picked up full court and really took them out of their comfort zone,” Lin said. “I think that’s what changed the whole game.”
While Curry’s defense helped catalyze Harvard’s second-half comeback, Casey sacrificed his body to seal the victory for the Crimson.
With momentum shifting back to the Eagles as the Harvard lead dwindled to four, Boston College point guard Biko Paris blew past Lin and appeared to have a clear lane to the basket, but Casey stepped in front to take his third charge of the game.
“Obviously the biggest play of the game was that charge,” Lin said. “We needed a stop to kind of put the game away. He just did a great job with his rotation, and he was unselfish in terms of giving up his body.”
THREE-PEAT
Harvard’s win over Boston College marks its third victory in as many seasons against an elite non-conference opponent and its second in a row over the Eagles.
In Amaker’s first season at the helm, the Crimson defeated Big Ten opponent Michigan, 62-51, in front of a home crowd at Lavietes Pavillion.
And last January, Harvard traveled to Conte Forum, where it upset the Eagles of the ACC, 82-70, just days after Boston College had trumped then-No. 1 North Carolina. But apparently, Amaker doesn’t see a connection in the three big wins of his Crimson tenure.
“It’s almost like, last year was last year and doesn’t have any effect on this year," Amaker said. “Certainly we were able to win last year and felt great about it, but I’m not sure that has any bearing on this game and tonight.”
Harvard will get its final shot—at least during the regular season—at an opponent from a major conference on December 23, when the team travels to Washington D.C. to take on Georgetown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The undefeated streak of the Harvard women’s basketball team at home survived another night—and double overtime—as the Crimson defeated Northeastern (5-3), 90-85, yesterday evening. Harvard (6-3) is now 5-0 at home and can boast its best start since the 2001-02 season.
The Crimson was led by sophomore Brogan Berry, who had a career-high 31 points, junior Emma Markley, who recorded her third consecutive double-double, with 20 points and 10 rebounds, and freshman Victoria Lippert, who also had a double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds.
“It was a very well-fought game between both teams,” Berry said. “We came out hard and never gave up.”
Although the victory was well-fought, the Harvard performance was not without its flaws. The Huskies out-rebounded the Crimson 58-52 overall, bringing down an impressive 29 offensive boards to Harvard’s 13. Northeastern sophomore Brittany Wilson, who recorded a game-high 34 points, had 21 rebounds herself.
“We gave up way too many offensive boards,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “Our defense was good, but it was our rebounding that killed us.”
“We had a little trouble with their penetration and definitely with our rebounding,” Berry added. “We’ve been having trouble with [rebounding] all season, but every game, it’s our priority to improve on that.”
Aside from rebounding, Harvard was effective on the offensive attack, but neither team could gain a clear advantage.  Both the first and second halves brought a series of lead changes and momentum shifts, and the greatest separation between the opponents was just seven points.
The Crimson entered halftime with a 35-31 advantage over the Huskies, powered by a late scoring surge by Berry.
The second half, much like the first, saw neither team dominate play. A run early into the second half put Harvard up by seven, but Northeastern fought back, evening the score at 59 with just under seven minutes left in regulation. A final layup by Lippert, off of an assist from Berry, in the waning seconds of the half tied the game at 65, forcing overtime.
Throughout the extra period, the Crimson and the Huskies went back and forth, each scoring nine points. Lippert, off of the same shot that forced the first overtime, sent the game into double overtime for only the second time in Crimson history.
Finally, in the second overtime, Harvard was able to build a lead that outlasted Northeastern, fueled mainly by Berry, Lippert, and Markley. When the Huskies fouled, the Crimson answered by going 4-of-6 from the stripe, sealing the victory.
Harvard’s impressive overtime performance against Northeastern is a stark contrast to the one it had only weeks ago against New Hampshire, getting outscored, 20-7, in the extra period to drop a 78-65 decision to the Wildcats.
Last night was a different story.
“We just weren’t that tough in the UNH game,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were tough enough to come back in the second half, but then we relaxed on them. Maybe that was a good lesson to learn.”
“We really kept our composure towards the end,” Berry added. “I’m so proud that we came together and fought to the last.”
For Coach Delaney-Smith and the Crimson squad, Berry’s performance and leadership was a high point for the game and season.
“[Berry] is probably the best point guard I’ve ever coached, even as just a sophomore,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s leading a team that’s still being created...and she’s just terrific in every regard.”
Berry is currently leading the Ivy League in average assists with 7.3 per game and had a game-high eight dishes against Northeastern.
The victory over the Huskies is the last game for Harvard before the 20-day break that precedes the final push towards the conference season.
“I definitely think it’s very helpful to go out on a win,” Berry said. “Now we can take this win, and have the chance to go into our break and work on the things we need to work on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Crimson’s third-period surge narrowed Boston College’s lead to one, the Harvard men’s hockey team (1-8-2, 1-5-2 ECAC) was not able to overcome the No. 10 Eagles (9-3-2, 6-3-2 Hockey East) Wednesday night, giving up a 3-2 loss at Bright Hockey Center. The defeat extends Harvard’s winless streak to 10 games.
The Crimson outshot BC, 27-26, and Harvard’s special teams went 1-for-3 on the power play while killing all of the Eagles’ man-advantages.
“I’m proud of the way our guys battled—they stayed with it,” said head coach Ted Donato ’91. “There were no heads down in between periods. We kept coming, and we had a chance to tie the hockey game.”
Junior Michael Biega paced the Crimson offense, scoring the final goal of the game, tallying an assist on Harvard’s first score, and leading the squad with five shots.
Halfway through the third period, after a BC blueliner gave up the puck right outside the crease, Biega pounced, seizing control of the puck and launching a shot between Eagle goaltender Parker Milner’s legs to narrow BC’s lead to 3-2.
And at 14:34 into the first period, Biega launched a quick shot through traffic, which sophomore Daniel Moriarty redirected into the right corner of the net to put Harvard on the board, 2-1.
“Michael was excellent tonight,” Donato said. “He was a going concern every time he had the puck, and he’s a guy who’s taken a big leap this year. I think he’ll be a real key player to us as we hopefully surge to a better second half.”
But by that point, the Eagles had already established a solid lead. In the first frame, BC hammered out two goals in three minutes. Sophomore Cam Atkinson found the net after picking up a pass from defenseman Philip Samuelson to put the Eagles on the board at 8:39. And sophomore Paul Carey ripped it high from the left side to send the puck past Crimson netminder Kyle Richter just two minutes later, giving his squad a 2-0 lead.
Though Moriarty’s goal cut BC’s lead in half, just after time ran out on a Harvard penalty early in the second period, Eagles sophomore Jimmy Hayes gave his team some breathing room. Winger Steven Whitney took a hard shot from the center that ricocheted off the right post, but Hayes was at the corner to stuff it in, boosting the score to 3-1.
“The first three goals, none of them were I would say [Richter’s] fault, but I think that all six guys could’ve done some things differently,” Donato said. “At that point, we needed a change, and sometimes you do that just as much for the rest of the guys as to change the pace of it a little bit. [Junior] Ryan [Carroll] came in and played very well and gave us a chance to come back.”
Backup netminder Carroll took over for Richter midway through the second and made 17 saves in 36 minutes to shut out the Eagles’ offense for the rest of the match.
The Crimson had some solid chances in the final period, firing 14 shots to BC’s 11.
Michael Biega skated the puck up the left boards and centered it to sophomore Alex Killorn, who passed it over to freshman Danny Biega in the center of the slot, but the rookie’s attempt was blocked by the BC defense. And Killorn, who laid up four shots on goal, fired a final shot in the last minute, when Donato took out Carroll for an extra attacker.
But Harvard’s offensive efforts were not rewarded.
“We’re doing a lot better job in the offensive zone,” Michael Biega said. “We got more guys in front of the net, more shots through…our forecheck was much better. We got in our zone and put pressure on them, so in that respect, our offense was a lot more effective. We just have to work on getting more shots on net, but we did a good job.”
The Crimson will have a three-week break for the holidays before facing off against No. 7 Quinnipiac back at the Bright on Dec. 29.

Abra Quadbra! Pfoho residents got a break from the pressures of reading period Wednesday night when Samuel A. Wright, a Pfoho night guard of two  years, put on a magic show at a special study break in the dining hall.
The room was packed with excited  students, tutors, and even the House Master’s wife and daughter, who  watched Wright’s card tricks, rope illusions, and ring acrobatics  with amazement.
To one particularly impressive  trick, in which Wright made a lime appear under a cup, one Pfoho resident  shouted “How did that just happen?! That was amazing!”
But it was the final illusion that really proved Wright to be a master magician. He took a $20 bill which had the name of a Pfoho resident  written on it, turned it into one dollar bill, then opened a bag which  contained an orange, peeled the orange, and revealed the twenty dollar  bill with the student’s name on it. Wright received a standing  ovation.
“I know how Harvard can solve the budget crisis,” said Anne E. DeAngelo ’12. “Cut open magic oranges and find twenties inside.”
Flyby has to admit, we were  impressed. Find out more about the man behind the magic, after the jump.
Wright said that he has been  persuing magic since he was 8 years old and started putting on shows  professionally when he was 18. He said that he performs because  he loves creating “an ideal of childlike wonderment” in the audience.
“As adults, sometimes we  forget that sense of childlike hope,” he said. “I hope to create  that with my magic.”
Wright said that when he works  as a nighttime guard in Pfoho, students often come to the office to  watch him perform.  It was Robb Fitzsimmons ’10, a late-night  regular in the dining hall, who decided to put the show together to  share Wright’s magic, which he called “pretty amazing stuff,” with  the whole Pfoho community.
Wright said he enjoyed  performing for Pfoho.
“Any time a show ends in  a standing ovation, it's good,” he said.

If you happened to be studying in Lamont Cafe on Wednesday night, you may have gotten a surprise visit from a certain gift-bearing dean.
Dean of Harvard College Evelyn M. Hammonds arrived at Lamont Cafe around 10:00 p.m. bearing soda and burritos from Felipe's for the hungry, sleep-deprived masses.  Check out the video here.
"We just thought this would be a fun thing to do because everybody is working so hard and studying so hard," Hammonds told us, "and the term had seemed so short to so many people, so we just thought this would be a nice thing to make it a little easier."
Hammonds encouraged students to text their friends and within 15 minutes, the three trays of chicken burritos and one tray of vegetable burritos were all gone.
"In time of finals, this was a nice surprise," said Kennedy School student Ana Bulic who was busy chowing down her burrito, "We shouldn't be eating at 10 in the evening, nevertheless, this is really nice."

Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry, sure. But being President of a prominent university—or country— means having to say it, and say it often.
In response to this week’s squash bagel debacle, Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim apologized to University President Drew Gilpin Faust on Tuesday at an Ivy League Presidents’ meeting in New York. He also promises to apologize to Harvard squash player, Franklin Cohen, and his parents, according to the Associated Press.
“While we encourage students to vigorously support our athletes, we expect them to do so in a way that reflects our pride in those teams, not disrespect for others,'' wrote Kim, Dartmouth's Acting Dean of the College Sylvia Spears and the Acting Athletic Director Bob Ceplikas in an e-mail sent Tuesday to students, faculty, and staff.
We understand, based on our brief experience at seedy sports bars and after previous controversies at elite universities, that women and sports are touchy subjects. But food items? We at FlyBy are much too gluttonously in love with nomnoms to understand that.
HUDS will be serving bagels at breakfast all week (like they do every week), and squash for lunch on Saturday (as they do several days every week). Maybe HUDS isn’t intentionally showing support by providing us with the related food items. But that shouldn’t stop you from justifying that extra dollop of cream cheese and that additional piece of satisfyingly stringy spring summer squash. It certainly won’t stop us.

Students were evacuated from Gore Hall in Winthrop House after smoke in the House’s kitchen prompted a dining hall worker to pull the fire alarm, according to the House’s resident dean Gregg A. Peeples.
The alarm was pulled around 8:10 p.m., according to students at the scene, who were allowed back into the building around 9 p.m. Edward C. Traver '11 said that the entryway smelled of smoke ten minutes before the alarm went off.
Around 9 p.m., fire officials were going to the House’s roof to check vents, as smoke was seen coming from the kitchen ceiling, according to witness reports.
"This was a routine call, certainly not run of the mill," said Cambridge Fire Department Captain Bill Braithwaite. "We bring all of our stuff out because we don't know what's going on."
Two fire trucks were on the scene. Around 8:30, officials unrolled hoses into the dining hall, but they were never used.
"We're investigating the sources of the odor, it can be common in winter," Braithwaite said.
