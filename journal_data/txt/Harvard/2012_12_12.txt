After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Look elsewhere for a light, feel-good musical—from electroshock therapy to suicide, “Next to Normal” certainly doesn’t shy away from heavy subject matter. This revival of Brian Yorkey’s Pulitzer Prize-winning work by Allen J. Macleod ’14, which ran at Farkas Hall through Sunday, did the off-Broadway original proud. The cast, through its excellent singing and acting, created a show that was a complex and emotionally charged portrait of madness rather than a caricature.
In “Normal,” all is not well with the Goodman family, whose aspirations for all-American normalcy are thwarted by the mother Diana’s (Amy K. Sparrow ’15) increasing mental instability. Haunted by visions of her dead son (Anise Molina ’14) and torn between her husband’s (Adam J. Conner ’14) pleas to seek psychiatric care and her own desire to escape the numbness that the medications bring, Diana descends into a downward spiral that drags her whole family with her. As her perfectionist daughter Natalie (Morgan E. Henry ’14) comes under the influence of her slacker boyfriend Henry (Justin S. Pereira ’13), the family’s hopes of maintaining a veneer of calm become increasingly unattainable.
Tackling the subject of madness means walking a fine line: the performance has to portray the drama and poignancy of the condition without coming off as goofy or exploitative. As Diana, Sparrow was more than up to the task—she dazzled in the lead role, capturing equally well Diana’s Valium-induced stupor and her head-first pitch into madness after going off her pills. When Diana’s condition grows so bad that she finally decides to undergo electroconvulsive therapy, Sparrow turned what could easily have been a bad parody of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” into a nuanced and affecting performance. She brilliantly expressed Diana’s fear that she might have inflicted irreparable damage upon herself. Sparrow’s portrayal in this scene was characterized by restraint—through the tone of her voice she communicated her character's anxiety while skillfully avoiding tipping into farce. Her commanding presence onstage grounded the play as her character’s psyche became more and more unraveled.
The rest of the cast is almost universally strong. As Diana’s psychiatrist, David A. Sheynberg ’16 effortlessly shuttled back and forth between reality and Diana’s crazed hallucinations of him. During his interplay with Sparrow in “My Psychopharmacologist and I.” Sheynberg played up the song’s dark, sardonic notes with a confident swagger and a glint in his eye. Pereira expertly managed his character’s turn from lazy stoner to responsible boyfriend when Natalie begins to come undone He projected true compassion when trying to help Natalie come to grips with her disintegrating family. The one small crack in this otherwise stellar production was Molina, who slithered and slunk around his living family members and stood uncomfortably close to them, as if he were trying to seduce them rather than haunt them. But he shapes up in the second act, during which he take on a more sinister tone and manner as the pressure of keeping the family together renders his father more and more vulnerable to his influence.
With more than 30 songs, “Next to Normal” is almost entirely music. Instead of the songs being broken up by chunks of action, they often directly follow each other and even interweave as the focus shifts from one character to another. It’s a tall order, but this cast handled it with the style and grace that is usually associated with a professional production. The singing balanced perfectly with the accompaniment under the music direction of Sam R. Moore ’15 and Melanie J. Rucinski ’15. Nor did the constant singing interfere with the actors’ ability to emote. In “You Don’t Know,” Diana rejects her husband’s claim that he understands what she’s going through. Sparrow begins the song with repressed fury, by degrees releasing it until her character is built up into a full-fledged, mania-fueled rage. And in “Song of Forgetting,” Henry, Sparrow, and Conner come together for a moving number that evokes by turns hopefulness, frustration, and despair.
The set was skeletal—the house was nothing but a stark white frame, suggesting the fragile framework of Diana’s sanity and her family’s stability. But lighting designer Joseph R. Seering ’13 shocked the muted set to life with explosions of pink, red, and blue in Diana’s moments of true mania. The technique was particularly effective in delineating the difference between reality and Diana’s hallucinations, which may otherwise have been unclear.
Despite the darkness of most of the play, “Next to Normal” ends on an optimistic note, with the Goodmans realizing that while their problems may never completely be solved, they can, at least, be contented and attain a modicum of normalcy. Similarly, the cast of “Next to Normal,” was about as close to professional as you could ask a college production to be. The ups far outweighed the downs, and the cast ultimately succeeded in ridding the play of any potential melodrama. Instead the audience was given a frank and affecting portrait of madness and its devastating effects on families.

I love Washington, D.C. I love the monuments and museums that dot the National Mall, I love the cobblestone streets split by old trolley tracks that run through Georgetown, and I even love the dank, musty smell that permeates the air in my local Metro station. I could not be prouder to inform people that, when I say I come from Washington, D.C., I mean it. Unlike the Marylander or Virginian who lives in a suburb just outside the District’s bounds yet insists on calling him or herself a D.C. native, I actually reside within the 10-square-mile, diamond-shaped area our forefathers carved out centuries ago.
But, despite my hometown love and pride, I cast my ballot as a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts in November’s election. That is because I wanted a voice, and voters in Washington, D.C., our nation’s capital and center of the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the country, have no voting representation in Congress. This needs to change.
D.C. license plates clearly display the following slogan: “Taxation without representation.” The motto should sound particularly familiar to Bostonians who remember tales of the original Tea Party: angry Sons of Liberty dumping cargo into their city’s harbor to protest British-imposed taxes on tea and other goods. The Sons of Liberty were acting on behalf of colonists who maintained that, since they supported the British government by paying taxes and were subject to its regulation, they ought to have a voice in making its laws.
The Constitution gives Congress the power to “exercise legislation in all cases” over D.C. For centuries, this provision meant that D.C. was ruled exclusively by Congress and forbidden from electing its own local government. It also meant that the District, since it was not a state, was entitled neither to votes in the Electoral College nor to representatives in the House or Senate.
Perhaps when the United States had just been formed, when no one could have predicted that D.C. would become a major city with a substantial population of permanent residents or that the national government would play such an active role in those residents’ daily lives, it did not seem so wrong to deprive District-dwellers of voting representation. But D.C. has grown and established itself as an important metropolitan area, and the national government’s actions certainly do affect its citizens in significant ways.
In Federalist Paper 43, James Madison gave another reason D.C. was not created as a state with voting rights: Since the central government had to hold supreme authority over the states, making D.C. a state would result in an imbalance of power. Madison thought that other states would bow down to D.C., impeding their independence. But time has proven this argument wrong. Texas, for example, does not affirm gay marriage even though it is legal in the city where the Capitol building is located, and it is unlikely that granting that city a few votes in Congress would change the longhorn state’s stance.  In short, states will not change the amount they pander to the federal government if D.C. gains representation.
It took nearly 200 years before any action at all was taken to address D.C.’s problem. And even that action only provided a partial solution. In 1961, 23rd Amendment to the Constitution gave D.C. residents a say in the presidential election for the first time in history. In 1970, the District of Columbia Delegate Act gave them a non-voting representative in the House. And in 1973, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act gave them their own local elected government.
Still, the District government’s laws are subject to review and revision by Congress. And D.C.’s House delegate may only serve on committees and speak on the floor; she is not allowed to vote on legislation. What’s more, D.C. lacks even that in the Senate.
The District of Columbia ought to have full voting representation in Congress.  The fact that over 617,000 United States citizens—more than the population of Wyoming and only slightly less than that of Vermont—are shut out from the legislative branch of the national government is shocking. That anyone in our country is denied a role in shaping the policies that govern them undermines the theory of representative democracy that defines us.
The only way to constitutionally correct this oversight is once again to amend our nation’s founding document to give D.C. residents the representation they deserve. There has been opposition to taking this final and necessary step, maybe because of political concerns: D.C. is overwhelmingly Democratic. But when it comes to correcting a fundamental constitutional defect, we must set partisanship aside.
As a student at an out-of-(non)-state school, I am lucky enough to receive the representation in our lawmaking body for four years. But other D.C. residents are not so fortunate. They cannot simply relocate their political allegiance for elections, and so they remain voiceless. It is high time for the United States to give D.C. real representation in all levels of our national government. It is high time for this country to live up to the ideals for which it was established. It is high time for us to eliminate this colonial relationship.

In an interview with PBS in 2002, Israeli author Amos Oz defined tragedy as "a clash between right and right." Indeed, a clash between right and wrong would be rather boring, lending itself to an easy solution. In the bitterest conflicts, both sides argue over who is right and who is wrong. Because of how painfully they have been wronged, each side is unable to see beyond their own victimhood. What they fail to see, however, is that the past has passed. When so much pain has been inflicted, recognizing the wounds of your enemy can be the only way forward.
A remarkable study by anthropologist Scott Atran and psychologist Jeremy Ginges went by virtually unnoticed when it was published in 2009. The two researchers interviewed 4,000 Israelis and Palestinians from all walks of life, asking them what a peace settlement would require. The results were astounding. It was not material or pragmatic concessions—border changes, the end of settlements, monetary compensation, and the right of return—that pushed Israelis and Palestinians towards peace. Rather, it was the simplest and seemingly the easiest action: a symbolic apology.
Radicals who refused money or land concessions were significantly more inclined to accept deals that involved symbolic gestures by their enemies. Mousa Abu Marzook, Hamas’s deputy chairman, when asked about a potential Israeli apology, stated, “Yes, an apology is important, as a beginning. It’s not enough because our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.” Benjamin Netanyahu, president of Israel, when asked if he would accept a two-state solution along 1967 borders if all Palestinian groups recognized the Jewish right to an independent state, said: “O.K., but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations.”
Apologies do not end wars, but in a conflict as stagnant as the one in Israel and Palestine, respecting the sacred and symbolic promotes progress on the material. The current peace process is entrenched in a utilitarian, tit-for-tat calculus: Give Israel this, then you must give the Palestinians that. In reality however, the pragmatic concessions are the most superficial. Amos Oz notes that, “a conflict begins and ends in the hearts and minds of people, not in the hilltops.” The hilltops are rallying points, symbols of a deeper conflict: the belief that the enemy is not like us. They do not and cannot think like us. The real stumbling block in this conflict, then, is the unwillingness to admit wrong.
In 2009, I spent two months in Israel and Palestine. Most of that time was spent living and working in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank. I tried to learn as much about the conflict as possible from as many perspectives as possible. At Tel Aviv’s airport on my way home, I was detained by Israeli authorities after they noticed the Arabic dictionary in my backpack. After two hours of interrogation and a thorough strip search, I was blacklisted from Israel for suspicious activities and sent home.
As a freshman at Harvard, I began writing articles on Israel and Palestine. I joined Harvard’s Palestine Solidarity Committee, helping organize events and meetings to raise awareness on the Palestinian plight. After a year, I stopped writing articles and left PSC. I am not a defeatist nor am I afraid, but I refuse to preach to the choir. My articles earned me praise from those who already agreed and hate from those who didn’t. But what really saddened me was the “I know I am right” attitude that I experienced in PSC and its pro-Israel counterparts. Of course we are right. The problem is that the other side believes something different and believes it is right, too.
Japanese author Haruki Murakami spoke some curious words concerning the humanity of the enemy: “Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks it, I will always stand on the side of the egg. Yes, no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg, I will stand with the egg. Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong; perhaps time or history will decide.”
On one level, the wall and the egg are metaphors for power versus weakness, for bombs and tanks versus unarmed civilians. More deeply, however, the metaphor sees each human being as an egg, a unique soul in a fragile shell struggling in face of the high wall of life. The wall is the struggle against the imperfections of the time and place in which we are born, imperfections that threaten to crush and kill each and every one of us.
Israel and Palestine are a couple proclaiming the same self-fulfilling prophecy: “My enemy hates me! The wall is too big!” Tensions rise and a fight breaks out between the angry couple. The prophecy is fulfilled. But the prophecy reeks of loneliness. Israel and Palestine are nervous lovers who have not yet come to grips with the weakness and humanity of the other. Peace begins in the mind. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. Were this page big enough, I would repeat it forever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Senator McCain conceded defeat after his 2008 presidential campaign, he graciously said, “These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to [President Obama] tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.” That was a sincere statement from a man who has fought both parties on campaign finance reform, wasteful spending, immigration, torture, and so much more. The John McCain of 2008 could have been President Obama’s loyal opposition, a bridge between two divided parties. As the recent controversy over the September 11 attacks in Benghazi has shown, the old John McCain is gone. America needs him back.
The old John McCain was the maverick many Americans loved. In 2000, he confronted the religious fringe of his party and labeled Pat Robertson and Jerry L. Falwell “agents of intolerance.” In 2007, McCain said the “rhetoric that many Hispanics hear” from his party made them feel marginalized. Once upon a time, he signaled he would support ending the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy if the military leadership asked for the change. And he even reached across the aisle on issues like campaign finance reform.
But in the past few years, McCain has taken fewer maverick-worthy positions, while flip-flopping on critical issues. In 2006, during the run-up to the 2008 presidential race, McCain pandered to evangelicals by walking back his “agents of intolerance” remark. When the military supported a shift away from “don’t ask, don’t tell” in 2010, McCain criticized the president. In 2011, the man who had once criticized his party for its anti-Hispanic sentiment incorrectly claimed “substantial evidence” that illegal immigrants set devastating wildfires in Arizona. As Mark McKinnon, the former McCain advisor and current IOP fellow said, “A lot of people, including me, thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges.” In the ultimate rejection of his old beliefs, McCain said, “I never considered myself a maverick,” despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
The story of Senator McCain’s decline is a case study in the kind of divisive influences that have disrupted American political discourse over the past four years. In 2010, just two years after his defeat in the presidential election, McCain faced a primary challenge from the Tea Partier J.D. Hayworth. The Hayworth campaign was built on the idea that McCain was not a real conservative, on everything from campaign finance laws to what he called “amnesty” for immigrants. McCain won the primary battle, but bipartisanship was the cost of victory. The patriot who had once criticized his own party for anti-immigration policies and worked on immigration reform bills suddenly changed course and supported Arizona’s harsh immigration law.
Of course, the 2010 primary battle was only the continuation of the conservative stances McCain had to take in order to win the Republican presidential primary in 2008. But after his concession speech, that was reason to hope he could return to his roots. Sadly, the Senator McCain of today appears embittered, angry, and unwilling to help move America forward. A decade ago, he would have stood up for what is right. Today, he looks to score cheap political points.
A recent example of McCain’s inability to reach across the aisle to address important issues can be seen in his response to the recent terrorist attacks in Benghazi. The Senator has called the Benghazi attacks “as bad as Watergate” and promised to block United NationsN Ambassador Susan E. Rice’s hypothetical nomination to be Secretary of State simply because she spoke from talking points prepared by the intelligence community. There is room for legitimate doubt about whether McCain was being particularly forceful in his mission to find out what happened or simply trying to hurt the Obama Administration. When Senator McCain missed a classified briefing on the Benghazi attacks in favor of a press conference to criticize President Obama about the lack of information on that very issue he showed his true colors. The old McCain would have been laser-focused on investigating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks in Benghazi. The new McCain seems to fantasize about a scandal to end President Obama’s career.
Senator McCain does not have to be this way. With the fiscal cliff on the horizon and in the aftermath of a bruising presidential election, Americans want compromise. To restore faith in government, they need it. They want a maverick who will be President Obama’s ideological opposite yet will break with his own party to do the right thing. There is no heir apparent to be the Republican standard bearer after Governor Romney’s defeat, leaving a void to be filled by Sarah Palin if Republicans are not careful. Senator McCain should take up this role, not as a man seeking higher office, but as a statesman.
John McCain has had a challenging few years, but if he takes up the mantle of the loyal opposition, he could be remembered as a legendary senator who negotiated compromises on the most stubborn issues of our time rather than an ex-maverick who fell from grace. America needs someone to bridge its partisan divide. After 25 years in office and two presidential campaigns, it is Senator McCain’s chance to shine. We can only hope that he will resurrect his career and work to change the course of American politics along with it.

Controversial flyers satirically advertising a fictional Pigeon final club, anonymously placed under students’ doors and bearing provocative statements like “Jews need not apply” and “Coloreds OK” rightfully sparked community indignation. Less thoughtful was the knee-jerk administrative response that condemned the flyers as “deeply disturbing” and needlessly sought out the distributors.
Although the authors of the invitations undermined their credibility with excessively incendiary rhetoric, the administration’s misplaced response only further undermines meaningful discussion on the roles and responsibilities of final clubs. Though clumsy and insensitive, the flyers brought to light the well-deserved notoriety of the all-male social clubs. Yet administrative efforts to seek out the perpetrators ignored the very real problems raised by the flyers and comes uncomfortably close to censorship of free speech, the most essential element of education.
Efforts to enforce civility, though well intentioned, are ultimately myopic. The desire for some students to avoid discomfort does not trump the right to freedom of expression, disagreeable as it may be. Certainly, criticisms of and limitations on hate speech in many cases are necessary, but a poorly rendered satirical flyer can hardly be considered an incident of hate speech. Indeed, the administration’s response to the flyers undermines limitations on hateful speech that are truly warranted and further marginalizes the gravely misunderstood principle of political correctness in the eyes of many.
In responding to the flyers rather than the clubs themselves, administrators have pointed to their obviously inflammatory and tasteless language while ignoring the more pressing issues masked beneath. Although off-color, the flyers strongly underscored problems with exclusivity of final clubs by playing on their reputations as exclusive and sexist. Paradoxically, the University seeks the authors who brought these issues into the focus rather than addressing the deeper issues themselves.
And the issues are many. Harvard cut official ties with the all-male clubs in 1984 for violating its anti-discrimination policy by excluding women. Final clubs have also long suffered allegations of excessive drinking, hazing, and sexual assault. While the University does not release statistics about campus sexual assault, many in the Harvard community believe final clubs create unsafe environments. While there have been better efforts to bring about discussion on these issues by individual students, the College has not taken leadership on this important student issue.
We urge the administration to shift away from its investigation into the flyers’ authors and to focus instead on the more salient issues, like the social vices the satirists attempted to draw attention to. Patronizing students by limiting offensive speech disallows the opportunity for students to judge action by their own moral agency and often obscures, as is the case in this incident, a more pressing message. Disruptive pamphlets like the Pigeon flyers are, perhaps, necessary evils in an open culture of free speech. Ultimately it is a small price to pay.

The Cambridge City Council broached the issue of Cambridge police response to underage drinking at loud parties within city limits during its meeting Monday night.
The discussion focused on an incident at the Cambridge Gateway Inn early in the morning of July 5, 2012. Two Cambridge police officers responding to a noise disturbance in a room filled with 30 people found alcohol, marijuana, and three loaded guns.
Some patrons of the party were believed to be consuming alcohol underage.
Despite overwhelming evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the police made no arrests and filed no charges.
According to City Manager Robert W. Healy, officers were only able to clear the room and secure the firearms due to a lack of available backup.
The only city response to the incident was a warning to the Gateway Inn by Cambridge licensing agencies.
“I’m troubled to know that I could have a party at the Gateway, pay cash, supposedly have to identify myself when renting the room to know who was admitted and to have this happen—underage drinking, marijuana, guns—with no consequences,” Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 said. “It seems that nobody was held accountable, other than the Gateway.”
But Healy adamantly defended the police department’s response.“Well, Councillor, who are we going to charge?” Healy asked.
The Council decided to continue the discussion at the next meeting.
Several transit issues were also discussed, most of which were passed to various subcommittees or future meetings.
The Council supported and passed to a subcommittee the proposed offering of a diminished-rate membership of the Hubway bike sharing program for low-income residents.
The Council also pledged to look into Harvard Square’s tourism industry.
“Harvard Square tourism...we don’t even regulate it,” Councillor David P. Maher said.
Reeves suggested that Harvard be enlisted to help with bus traffic from tourism.
The Council was unanimous in its decision to continue investigating how to optimize the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority services for Cantabrigians.

In a tale of two bakeries, Harvard Square sandwich shop Darwin’s Ltd. now owns the building occupied by another Square baked goods favorite, Petsi Pies.
Those who favor Petsi’s lemon scones and banana bread over Darwin’s egg salad and Reubens need not fear for now, though—Darwin’s will not boot Petsi’s out of its location near Mather House for at least three years.
Renee McLeod, the owner of Petsi’s, signed a five-year lease on the first floor of the 31 Putnam Ave. townhouse that houses her café in 2006, then renewed it for another five years. She had expected to renew it once more in 2015, but in September, her landlords—the Cremaldi family, who previously operated a café there themselves—put the property on sale.
McLeod tried to buy it but could not raise the money. Steven and Isabel Darwin, who operate two local sandwich stores, purchased the building instead with plans to use the space for a third outpost of theirs after McLeod’s lease expires.
McLeod still operates her first Petsi Pies in Somerville, which she has maintained since 2003.
When her lease on the Cambridge property ends, she hopes to replace the Putnam Ave. café with a different second address.
“I would love another in the same neighborhood. I like the student population because I understand the flow of it. Being in the neighborhood has become a strong part of how we work and who we are,” she said. “[The Cremaldi family] warned me and encouraged me to buy the building but, I mean, I simply don’t have the kind of money they were looking for and I wasn’t able to get it.”
Yet she recognizes the appeal that owning just one shop for a time might hold.
“When I got the opportunity to expand into Cambridge it was scary and overjoying and fun, but I really liked having the simplicity of one little bakery before. That simpler life will be a bit of a rest for me,” she said.“Who knows? Anything’s possible in three years.”
Steven Darwin, also praising smaller management, said he would hold at three shops after he eventually opens on Putnam Ave.
“I’ve talked with a lot of business owners, and the reality is that once you get past the three store arc, you need to start running your business more like corporate America. So I’m kind of thinking three is about the maximum I can do and still keep it unique and fun and funky,” said Darwin, whose first two shops each feature sandwiches on their menus with different names taken from the surrounding streets.
Looking forward to the Putnam Ave. location, Darwin expressed excitement about being able to “triangulate” Harvard Square with his three shops, each within a 10 minute’s walk of Harvard Yard.
Ella G. Gibson ’15, a Matherite, regretted that Petsi Pies would eventually be displaced. “Have you ever had the chocolate bourbon pecan pie?” she asked.
Roommate Rebecca E. Nadler ’14 found it harder to choose between Petsi’s and Darwin’s as a neighbor. “It’s a tough one. They’re both so good.”

Four students will spend this winter break in Tanzania applying their computer science skills to help improve health infrastructure for clinics and hospitals.
The project is the pilot program for Tech in the World, a newly created student organization that seeks to send top computer science students to work on coding projects in developing countries. From Dec. 22 to Jan. 19, Brandon Liu ’14, Joshua K. Lee ’14, Salvatore R. Rinchiera ’14, and Christian C. Anderson ’13 will live in Dar es Salaam creating a solution to better the current management system of electronic medical records for maternal health care.
Liu, co-founder of Tech in the World, said he got the idea for the organization this summer after reading “Mountains Beyond Mountains,” a book focused on University Professor Paul E. Farmer’s work at hospitals in Haiti.
“As I was reading it, I was thinking that I really wanted to see how I could contribute to his work,” Liu said. “I started to talk to people in global health who said that they wanted more computer science people to get involved.”
The team plans to collaborate with students from Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology and a local Tanzanian entrepreneurship group in order to share their knowledge and ensure the long-term value of their projects.
“A lot of trips like these can be branded as voluntourism, where you are ostensibly providing value but, in reality, are really just a burden to whoever’s hosting you,” Liu said. “Pairing with someone locally tries to offset that to train people and have something sustainable.”
The group is also partnering with the Bienmoyo Foundation, an organization that matches volunteers with global health projects, and the Association of Private Health Facilities in Tanzania, an umbrella organization for all private health facilities in the country.
The four students will be joined by Mateus C. Falci ’14, a visual and environmental studies concentrator who will make a documentary of the experience.
The students plan to return to Dar es Salaam for the next few years to continue their service work.
“It’s good to have that continuity, to develop the relationship and build on prior work,” Liu said.
Though Tech in the World did not have a formal application process this year, Liu and his co-founder Lee hope to expand the team in the future to include strong computer science students from other schools, including Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“We definitely want people to be comfortable in the environment and, from day one, to be able to start coding,” Lee said.

Eight months into contract negotiations between Harvard University and the Harvard Union of Clerical Technical Workers, the two sides “remain mired in disagreements,” the union described the situation in a letter released Friday.
HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of the University’s librarians, secretaries, lab technicians, and other non-faculty staff, outlined the two most contentious negotiating points—salary increases and health care—in its message about its plans to move the talks forward.
The union and University were scheduled to ratify a new contract on July 1. Since that deadline passed months ago, the union’s old contract has continued to govern the workers’ relationship with Harvard.
“This is a difficult and frustrating situation for our members and our friends in the Harvard community,” HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said.
Jaeger said that Friday’s update was meant to show union members that negotiators were still putting “a lot of energy” into agreeing on a new contract.
“We’re going to continue to be creative, and we’re willing to compromise,” Jaeger said.
He said that the passing of time had caused more progress than the talks themselves.
Since workers’ health care plans are now already set for 2013, HUCTW has proposed that negotiators table the discussion of health care for active employees to ratify a contract faster.
“If the University can find a way to agree with us about that, that’s in a way hopeful,” Jaeger said. “Maybe that’s making lemonade out of lemons.”
The letter said that as time goes on, the union sees increased support from faculty and students.
“We’re thrilled about some of the fun energy that’s coming from some of the student groups,” Jaeger said, adding that the support was “encouraging and heartwarming.”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote that Harvard has made a number of proposals comparable to agreements it has reached over the past year with seven other unions.
Galvin wrote that over the past few weeks, administrators from around Harvard have met with union leaders to explain that the University faces financial pressures, the severity of which has been a point of disagreement between the two sides for months.
“We remain committed to an agreement that is fair both to the members of the HUCTW and the University as a whole, and we hope that substantive progress can be made at the negotiating table,” Galvin wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Samuel T. Moulton ’01, director of educational research and assessment at the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, is not averse to a little battiness.He wears his ties skinny and his jeans tight. He counts Harvard psychologists J. Richard Hackman and Mahzarin R. Banaji and “the spirit of William James” among his role models. And during his years as a graduate student he researched parapsychology, the study of scientifically inexplicable mental phenomena.
“I spent much of my graduate career researching extrasensory perception”—more commonly known as ESP—”which is actually not as deranged as it sounds,” Moulton says. “Well, it was a little batty, but utterly fascinating too.”
But despite his extensive research on divining the unknown, Moulton never predicted that his research in psychology would lead him to study—and teach about—how people learn.
As a Harvard graduate student, Moulton designed countless experiments to test for the existence of ESP. But after several years without confirmation of the phenomenon, he found himself gravitating toward applications of existing knowledge about the mind rather than speculation about how the mind could work.
“I found myself pretty expert in terms of research methodology but with no research program and somewhat disillusioned with psychological science,” Moulton says.
Armed with years of null data and a reputation as a skeptic of parapsychology, he looked instead to “the application of foundational research findings to vital real-world questions.”
Now a HILT director, Moulton stands not at the edge of perception but at a new frontier of teaching techniques. And in many ways, it is his background in psychological science that prepared him to help define the next big innovations in higher education.
SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK
Moulton first tried teaching while volunteering at a prison with a Phillips Brooks House Association program during his undergraduate and graduate years. He led weekly classes for inmates on recent developments in psychology.
His students were hungry for the information, Moulton says. Although Moulton had worked as a teaching fellow and instructor for undergraduate psychology courses while working toward his PhD, it was not until teaching a course on the science of pedagogy that he considered the study of learning and teaching as a career path.
“I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was such a thing as a science of pedagogy and shocked that it wasn’t being systematically incorporated into practice and policy,” Moulton says.
His mentor, Stephen M. Kosslyn, perceived the makings of an educator in Moulton right away.
“He was particularly interested in topics that spoke to ways that people could improve themselves,” Kosslyn writes in an email.
UP TO THE HILT
“I don’t teach, for the first time in my life,” Moulton says with a hint of irony of his job at HILT. But in his administrative capacity, Moulton hopes to continue applying the lessons of psychological sciences to the practice of teaching in higher education.
HILT is a presidential initiative founded at Harvard in 2011 with a donation from Law School graduates Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser. It is intended as an umbrella organization that facilitates innovation and excellence in learning and instruction, says Erin Driver-Linn, another director of HILT.
Once a teaching fellow in Moulton’s freshman class on personality psychology, Driver-Linn now works with him to design teaching methods that best complement the way students learn. Driver-Linn says that HILT is part of a larger wave of experiments in education that the University is exploring, including virtual education platform edX.
“Just looking in the press you would recognize that this is an interesting moment for higher education,” Driver-Linn said. “There is so much interest right now among faculty about learning and teaching.”
On any given day, Moulton can be found crunching numbers on spreadsheets, advising potential grantees at Harvard’s graduate schools, or combing professional literature for information on a proposal’s topic.
“He has an interesting background in the social sciences, but he does it in rigorous ways,” says Alexander G. Bick ’10, an MD/PhD student who received a HILT Hauser grant for an innovative approach to dissection and surgery.
Moulton once clustered the HILT project proposals by key words instead of discipline to identify common techniques that cut across the University. “He got people who wouldn’t have thought their projects had anything to do with each other talking,” Bick recalls.
STUDYING STUDYING
Since its inauguration in Jan. 2011, HILT has fielded over 255 applications from 644 people seeking funding for innovative educational programs. Of those, 47 grants have been approved for implementation this academic year. The projects range from new formats for test-taking to studies on sound in the classroom.
One grantee, Acting Chair of the Department of the History of Science Anne Harrington ’82, is redesigning the sophomore tutorial for newly declared concentrators to emphasize case studies rather than lectures.
“The result is that the students are not only learning the material, but also learning how to lead,” Harrington says.
In another HILT-funded project, sociology professors Kaia Stern and Bruce Western plan to expand the reach of the Prison Studies Project, previously a junior tutorial in which students traveled to a prison to learn alongside the incarcerated. Now the class is open to as many students as the program can accommodate, regardless of their year or concentration
.“Our work in classrooms cuts us off from social justice that we say we’re committed to.” Stern said.
While Driver-Linn and Moulton are both excited about HILT’s potential to revolutionize pedagogical methods, they are hesitant to make projections about its future success.
Moulton seems to hearken back to his days as a graduate student disproving psychic ability when he cautions against attempts at prescience.
“Prediction is very hard, especially about the future,” he says. “No one can know how it will turn out, but no matter what, it will be better for students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the federal government’s looming fiscal cliff dominates conversations on Capitol Hill, University President Drew G. Faust visited Washington on Monday to advocate for a continuing commitment to education and research funding.
Faust attended events at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., a consortium for business and political leaders, and at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank.
At the Economic Club, Faust joined Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia to announce that Georgetown would join edX, an online education venture launched by Harvard and MIT earlier this year.
Later in the day, Faust spoke at a Center for American Progress event entitled “Investing in the Future,” which was co-sponsored by Harvard and Google.
“We’re excited to have both Harvard and Google, because in some sense they are the beginning and end of the innovation chain,” said the Center’s president Neera Tanden as she introduced Faust.
Faust told the audience that the U.S. has benefited enormously from a national commitment to public education.
“The question now, as we debate how to address the deficit, is, ‘How do we maintain these commitments to access and opportunity, to make college affordable, and to provide paths forward for millions of students who will strengthen America’s economic foundation and will be the innovators who drive discovery in the future?’” Faust said.
Tanden agreed that innovation should be at the forefront of conversations about the national budget.
“These issues are actually inextricably linked,” Tanden said.
Faust said that she was concerned that government support for education had faltered in recent years, citing decreased funding for public universities.
“We have taken public higher education and essentially made it not public anymore,” Faust said. “I think education’s a public good. I think society ought to embrace public education as a public good, and we’ve been backing off from that.”
A month ago, Faust and 15 other leaders of universities and medical centers sent a letter to the Massachusetts congressional delegation asking that Congress avoid cuts to research funding.
The letter argued that funding should be seen not just as an expenditure, but as a budget solution.
“Support for federal research funding helps to ensure our nation’s health, prosperity, and international competitiveness,” the letter said. “It has never been more important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a three-part series on mental health at Harvard. Part I was published on Dec. 10, and Part III on Dec. 14.
In retrospect, Mackenzie believes she grew up with depression. Forced to deal with serious medical issues and abuse at home from a young age, Mackenzie found herself living with negative body image and self-esteem. Questions of sexuality and gender identity that arose in high school only complicated her emotional development.
When two of her blockmates decided to take time off due to mental illness in her sophomore year of college, Mackenzie became more withdrawn. When a third blockmate attempted suicide, the stress became overwhelming.
Mackenzie realized she needed serious professional help. Instead of visiting Harvard’s Mental Health Services, she opted to see an outside therapist.
“I had heard from a lot of people who didn’t trust them. I felt that just by the nature of being a college mental health organization with hundreds of patients per therapist, it’s not possible to deliver the care I needed,” she says.
Like other students interviewed for this series, Mackenzie had heard rumors from her peers about University Health Services. The reports she heard were “almost uniformly negative.”
Anyone confessing a mental illness will be forced to take time off, some fear. Others worry that those who do need time off campus to heal are hemmed in by the school’s insurance policies. Many share frustration with the process by which students who need less urgent care arrange appointments. In sum, these concerns paint a discouraging picture of Harvard’s services for some of its most fragile students.
TAKE A TIME OUT
Martin’s depression and suicidal thoughts escalated during his freshman fall. In November, when he was unable to sleep for nine days after a personal assault, Martin admitted himself to the hospital for suicidal ideation and paralyzing depression.
Though the rest of his freshman year was successful by many measures—nearly perfect GPA, lots of extracurricular activities, plenty of friends, and parties almost every weekend—Martin still suffered from feelings of inadequacy.
“The thoughts continued to haunt me throughout the summer. A few weeks before school began, I realized that I didn’t want to come back at that point,” he says.
He had discussed the possibility of taking a year off with his resident dean in the spring. The dean had assured Martin that voluntary leaves do not entail contracts, so Martin made his travel arrangements.
Then, just weeks before he was scheduled to depart, Martin heard from his dean that he would have to sign a waiver forcing him to work for six months of his year off and undergo a UHS evaluation before he would be allowed to return.
“It was a really upsetting interaction with the University,” Martin says. “I was told all the way up through summer that I would not have to sign a waiver since I was not being forced to take time off.”
Martin worries that stories of administrative pressure like his might prevent students from reaching out for help out of fear that they might be forced off campus or prevented from returning if they choose to go away.
Katherine A. Lapierre, chief of Student Mental Health Services, says that though misperceptions about leaves of absence abound, students are never forced to leave the University involuntarily because of mental health problems.
In a statement, UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker echoes that assertion. “SMHS is not in a position to require leave of absence,” Baker writes. “Our only policy is that students receive the best care possible, and the student, together with the University, makes decisions about the leave of absence.”
Even though the College does not compel students to deal with their mental health problems away from Harvard, it can put pressure on them. Alexa, who suffers from bipolar disorder, says that both before and after she attempted suicide, UHS doctors, tutors, her resident dean, and her House Masters all often encouraged her to take time off, an option she did not want to exercise.
Students who anticipate hearing similar suggestions from therapists and deans might avoid telling Harvard administrators about their mental health problems, Alexa worries. “The fear of mandatory time off thwarts any positive things that are going on,” she says.
Christine, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, reached out to UHS after attempting suicide her sophomore year and was surprised no one forced her to take time off. She says she worried that visiting UHS could jeopardize her future.
“I thought my career at Harvard would be over,” Christine says. “I was shocked by the extremely nurturing support I received from my resident dean and resident tutors as well as Harvard Mental Health Services. No one at any point viewed me as a threat to Harvard or the wellbeing of the community. Everyone wanted me to get better.”
DISTANCE LEARNING
A leave of absence, for some who do elect to spend time off campus, is just the right medicine.
During his year away, Martin backpacked through sixteen countries, held an internship in politics (where he learned he “absolutely” did not want to go into politics), and painted. He returned to Harvard free from suicidal thoughts.
“Getting out and experiencing the world gave me perspective of what I could do in the world,” he says. “It made me realize that I did not have to succeed on Harvard’s standards in order to succeed in the world. I could really do what I wanted with my life.”
Mackenzie left Harvard after her junior year. Living at home, she was able to hold a job and receive counseling. “I met people who didn’t think less of me away from Harvard,” she says. “I actually realized that life outside of here is a lot easier. For the first time I thought, ‘Maybe life won’t actually get harder. Maybe some things will be easier outside of Harvard.’”
For Christine, life away from Harvard was not easier at all. She took a year off after her second hospitalization in the spring of her sophomore year, but she had no money and no ties to her family to fall back on. No longer living in a dorm, she moved into an abandoned building in Central Square.
“It took a lot of courage,” she says. Yet away from an academic environment, she found right away that she could focus on religion, which brought her solace despite her health concerns and her living situation. “I remember not being stressed out not knowing what I’d do for my year off.”
Christine eventually found a job at a West Coast company, though she had no money to fly across the country.
“I told them, ‘You need to fly me out there and you need to advance my first paycheck.’ They said it wasn’t a problem, and I got to start building myself a life and a home,” she says.
Christine worked at the company and began studying the Bible four times a week. Coming to believe that Jesus loves her, Christine was able to find the hope needed to start recovering.
OUTSIDE AND UNINSURED
Those who might benefit from time away, like Christine, Mackenzie, and Martin did, must take into consideration the fact that leaving Harvard means losing not only access to libraries and dining hall food, but also, perhaps, their much-needed health insurance.
For those who rely on student insurance plans, finding a therapist, prescriber, or affordable drugs during a leave of absence can become a barrier to effective care.
Despite the many people who told her to take time off, Alexa stayed on campus because, as an international student, she could not find adequate health care at home. Now, she says, she regrets staying at Harvard while she was sick.
“This place is the most extraordinary smorgasbord of opportunity. If you’re not well, it’s hard to take advantage of it all,” she says.
Harvard allows students to apply for an extension of their health insurance benefits for up to four months after they leave campus. But for Martin, one semester did not seem enough time to fully recover. Since he knew he was going to lose his Harvard insurance, he returned home to file through his state as unemployed. After lots of time and paperwork, he received free insurance.
Mackenzie, who was able to take time off because she has private, non-Harvard insurance, says, “I was lucky, but I know many people who feel alone in a bad way when Harvard removes the needed support.... Also, it disproportionately affects the poorer students on campus, and that’s just an added stressor.”
UNDER PRESSURE
Every year, 1,150 undergraduates—roughly 17 percent of the student body—take advantage of the mental health services offered by UHS. Another 2,478 students from the graduate and professional schools also seek the help of Mental Health Services’ 17 full-time therapists and five full-time and one part-time prescribers. In addition, 720 undergraduates see counselors at the Bureau of Study Counsel, which offers therapy as well as academic workshops.
When students like Alexa, Christine, Mackenzie, and Martin come in to report severe depression and suicide attempts, UHS therapists take note right away. But such cases are not the norm for the practitioners in the Holyoke Center. On a daily basis, they are flooded with calls from much of the 25 percent of the student body that reports some symptoms of depression.
To handle the volume of requests, Mental Health Services employs what Lapierre calls a “triage system.” In a brief phone conversation, one of two access coordinators—a recently created, full-time position—determines the urgency of the patient’s case. Those coordinators see students themselves that day or within 48 hours if necessary. Otherwise, they schedule appointments for students with therapists.
Lapierre says that the system works. But in dorms and dining halls, students who talk about UHS—especially the mental health care branch—raise a constant drumbeat of complaints.
One student passed a Google doc around listservs last year, soliciting “horror stories” about UHS to present to administrators. One published her own experience, writing in a Crimson column last spring that she sought help from a private therapist when she was frustrated that her UHS appointments to treat her panic attacks were limited to half an hour every other week, since her UHS therapist said other students were more seriously ill. Commenters on any article touching on mental health frequently deride the UHS offerings, saying treatment is delayed, not frequent enough, or poorly coordinated.
Sophia V. Ohler ‘15 sought help for stress and depressive moods. Her encounter with the UHS triage system left her disillusioned.
During her diagnostic call, the practitioner on the other end of the line said she should visit the Bureau of Study Council instead since she “sounded fine.”
“It was just shocking to be told that you don’t need therapy,” says Ohler, a Crimson magazine writer. “I was furious. I was down for a while, and it was weird to be told, ‘Your issues aren’t big enough or important enough to be dealt with at UHS.’”
Even those who have benefited from UHS attention point to gaps in care for less severe issues. “They don’t have the staff needed,” says Martin, who was pleased with his personal experience at UHS.
“I think a large proportion of the Harvard population goes without the care they need and deserve.”
Though the complaints seem persistent, the policies do change as UHS makes strides toward seamlessly handling its caseload. Baker says that the recent addition of the access coordinators, who not only take calls but also track patients from urgent treatment to long-term clinicians, has helped reduce jarring “hand-offs” of patients.
Another new policy allows students on the Harvard health insurance plan who pursue therapy outside of UHS 24 visits per academic year, up from 12 visits under the last academic-year plan.
“Mental health care is a constantly developing field, and we work hard to remain abreast of the current treatment recommendations,” Baker writes. “We are always trying to improve the system of care as the science is continually moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In less than a week, two more institutions of higher education—Wellesley College and Georgetown University—have partnered with edX, the rapidly growing online educational venture started by Harvard and MIT last May. But six months after the launch, Harvard faculty continue to express a spectrum of opinions on whether HarvardX—the subset of edX courses offered by Harvard—will enhance or detract from on-campus instruction.
The issue was discussed at length last Tuesday at the Faculty meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, sparking vigorous discussion about how edX aligns with Harvard’s educational goals.
Some faculty expressed concerns that an aggressive pursuit of online education might redirect Harvard’s attention from on-campus learning and dilute Harvard’s brand.
“Will the outcome of this be less HarvardX than ex-Harvard?” English Department Chair W. James Simpson asked at the meeting.
Simpson also brought up questions about the evaluation and accreditation of hundreds of thousands of students.
In an interview after the meeting, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said that maintaining Harvard’s educational standards in the virtual realm is a top priority for HarvardX leaders.
History professor Charles S. Maier ’60 questioned whether edX could replicate the experience of a small seminar.
“The teaching experience I enjoy most is sitting around a table with 15 students, maybe a few more or less, and working through a problem,” he said. “Do we forswear this experience entirely with this type of project and, if not, how do we organize it?”
For some professors, the large scope of edX and the absence of in-person interactions runs counter to what they see as Harvard’s pedagogical priorities.
“Ever since I’ve been here, the effort has been to have more small group instruction,” German professor Peter J. Burgard said.
HarvardX Faculty Director Robert A. Lue said that Harvard wants to connect its virtual presence with classroom instruction, but recognizes that HarvardX will never be a replacement for the on-campus experience.
Harvard’s cohort of edX leaders emphasized that above all, edX is an experiment meant to navigate Harvard’s virtual presence in a world in which students are coming into college more experienced with technologically-driven  education.
Self-evaluative assessments, personalized feedback mechanisms, and structured online discussions have been proposed as just a few of the ways online education could supplement on-campus learning.
Administrators also highlighted the ways HarvardX has already touched global communities.
“When I was in India last year, I met with a number of officials who described some of the many challenges that they are confronted with in the area of public health, and particularly in terms of training and education,” University President Drew G. Faust told the Crimson. “Now we have 9,000 people from India alone taking the public health course that is among our very first offerings on edX.”
As faculty members debate the broader pedagogical impact of edX, many of them are already taking advantage of the innovative opportunities the platform presents.
Harvard expects to put up four new courses next year, in addition to a number of shorter “modules” of content that cover only a few weeks of material, according to Lue.
Lue also said that a number of professors have already started creating courses and modules that span a range of disciplines, from music to interpersonal relationships to history.
He was careful to distinguish the edX model from that of other massive open online course platforms, such as Coursera, which was created this April by two Stanford professors.
“Coursera seems to be exclusively about large numbers, a single mode of learning—as many courses as possible,”  Lue said. “HarvardX is about quality, impact, and pushing the impact of how we use technology to learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 19 seconds remaining in a midweek matchup that saw 11 lead changes in the second half alone, Terriers’ guard D.J. Irving knocked down what could have been a game-winning jumper on the right wing to put his team up, 64-63.
But with the clock winding down in Tuesday night’s contest, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers found himself with the ball in his hands. The rookie pushed the ball up the court, faked in to create space on the wing, and fired off a jumper of his own. And the shot fell through the net in front of a sparse crowd at Lavietes Pavilion, giving the Harvard men’s basketball team a one-point lead with just five seconds left.
“I thought [Chambers] was brilliant in his composure there and shot faking and getting an open lane to the basket in terms of the look,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He buried a short shot, an open shot that he’s pretty good at making, obviously.”
Although Irving—who finished with a game-high 24 points on 8-of-17 shooting and 4-of-7 from three—sprinted to the other end of the court and got off a shot inside the arc, the buzzer-beater rimmed out, letting Harvard claim a victory over crosstown rival BU, 65-64.
“Our kids executed [the end-of-game situation] brilliantly,” Amaker said. “That’s our strategy, our philosophy. That’s what we practiced. We try to get an open-floor situation and see if we can get a team to break down or even foul. We showed great composure [and] poise.”
Despite entering the second half down by seven after a collective 9-of-27 effort from the field—including 0-of-8 from three-point range—the Crimson quickly closed the gap. Chambers and co-captain Christian Webster led the way after the break, knocking down three and two treys, respectively, in the opening 6:32 of the second frame—going a collective 5-for-5 from deep during that time.
“What can you say about Siyani?” Amaker said “He’s been the heart and soul for us this year…. He was a savior for us. He made every big play that we needed, from the free throw line and obviously the game-winning shot.”
Although BU led by eight—the largest advantage held by either team at any point in the game—with 16:54 to play after a layup from Terriers forward Dom Morris, Harvard scored eight straight points to take a two-point lead just 2:49 later. The run included a four-point play from Chambers and a dunk from sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, who topped the Harvard scoring list with 21 and 16 points, respectively.
“Luckily I was able to hit some shots and my teammates hit some shots,” Chambers said. “Christian and [junior co-captain Laurent Rivard] both had some big shots down the stretch. And Wes made some great drives down the lane.”
From there, it was back-and-forth for the remainder of the contest, with neither team leading by more than four at any point.
“I though we shot the ball better [in the second half], which gave us some life and some energy,” Amaker said. “It certainly helped our crowd and got them behind us a little bit. We picked it up.”
With 3:06 to play in the first half, Smith converted a layup to tie up the game for the Harvard men’s basketball team at 23-23. But a 9-2 run by the Terriers in the remaining minutes gave BU a 32-25 lead before halftime.
Playing his first minutes since the Crimson’s Dec. 1 contest against Fordham, Smith had five blocks and six points in 16 minutes off the bench for the Crimson, including a two-handed dunk to give Harvard a four-point lead—its largest of the game—with 12:06 on the clock in the second half.
“[Smith] came in with some crucial minutes and made some big buckets for us and had some crucial blocks also,” Chambers said.
Webster—who had a season-high 13 points including three shots from long range—tied the game up for the Crimson, 60-60, with a three-pointer on the right wing off of a pass across the key from Chambers. And though Morris tied it up once again on a layup with 1:13 left to play, Harvard was able to close out the contest with one of two free throws from Saunders, and Chambers’ final basket.
“Both teams played exceptionally hard and made some incredible plays down the stretch to try to get the win,” Amaker said. “This is one of those games that, even though we came out on top, it’s hard for any team to lose a game like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball’s 65-64 win over Boston University at Lavietes Pavilion featured 13 ties, 18 lead changes, and a wild final 30 seconds that could have gone either way.
After a Terriers timeout with half a minute to play, junior guard D.J. Irving hit a mid-range jump shot with 19 seconds left in the game to give him 24 points on the night and his team a one-point lead with less than a full possession left on the clock.
The Crimson could have chosen to take a timeout with one more chance to re-take the lead. But as he has done before, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker opted for a quick in-bound play.
“We love doing that. That’s our philosophy,” Amaker said. “You want to catch the defense broken and open-floor. You don’t want them to feel like they can get set.”
With less than ten seconds left in the game, freshman guard Siyani Chambers penetrated, found an opening, and hit a short go-ahead jumper from the right side which doubled as the game winner and the biggest shot of his young career.
“I came off the ball screen trying to first create for my teammates, but then when the shot opened up, I just took the shot,” Chambers said.
But Chambers left just enough time on the clock to give Boston University one more chance at the win and yet another second-half lead change. The Terriers inbounded to Irving, who moved up the court, gained separation from sophomore Wesley Saunders, slipped just a bit, and took a shot at the buzzer that clanked off the rim.
Irving had enough of an opening that he could very easily have made the shot, but despite his open look, Amaker said that the Terriers’ chance at the buzzer-beater will not change the team’s strategy going forward.
“You don’t want to foul,” Amaker said of Boston University’s last-minute shot. “You’re just trying to keep the ball in front, and that’s hard to do against their team. You can see how quick and fast those guys blow it up the floor.... We were fortunate.”
Tuesday’s win was Harvard’s first one-point game since its 55-54 loss to Penn last February at home.
YATTA, YATTA, YATTA
Sophomore center Kenyatta Smith started early in the season, but after three consecutive games with three turnovers against Saint Joseph’s, Vermont, and Fordham, Smith saw no action in the team’s two most recent games at Boston College and at UConn.
But coming off the bench for the first time since Dec. 1, Smith played 16 minutes in which he excelled.
Smith scored six points on the night, including two late free throws with 2:35 left in the game to give Harvard a 62-60 lead. He also registered five blocks—many, again, coming in the middle of a back-and-forth second half—and a dunk that helped to get the crowd of 1,257 into the game.
“We’ve told him to keep his spirit right and his mind ready to go when we need him,” Amaker said. “We certainly thought we needed him tonight.... He really gave us a lift and did an outstanding job getting defensive rebounds.”
Smith’s playing time on Tuesday—his most since the Nov. 27 home game against Vermont—came largely at the expense of sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi, who played only five minutes, his lowest total so far this season.
THREE'S COMPANY
At the end of the first half, Harvard trailed 32-25, largely because of an abysmal 0-for-8 performance from beyond the arc. Boston University fared little better—the Terriers shot 2-for-8 in the frame—but rode nine fast-break points to Harvard’s two to take the seven-point halftime lead.
But at the start of the second half, the Crimson’s shooting improved immediately, starting with a three-pointer from Chambers to pull Harvard back within four.
The Crimson made its first five attempts of the half, and Harvard reclaimed the lead for the first time in the half six minutes into the period on another Chambers three.
The team’s shooting cooled down a bit as the half went on, but the Crimson still finished the half shooting an impressive 7-for-9 from beyond the arc. Chambers and co-captain Christian Webster each made three in the second half.
“Things can become contagious real quick—either way,” Amaker said of Harvard’s three-point shooting. “I thought that was probably what happened in both halves for us.”

As the holiday season explodes in full force and students try to squeeze in some gift shopping between final exams, the booksellers of Harvard Square are making it easy to find a budget-friendly stocking stuffer for all the different people in your life.For those looking for a book with a little bit of seasonal pizzazz, the Coop is probably the place to go. Directly across from the registers in the main entryway, the Coop has devoted a shelf to staff-recommended books for the holidays. There are around 25 titles on the shelf, each with a written recommendation from a different staff member.
Coop staffer Katie recommends Alastair Brotchie's "A Book of Surrealist Games" for the avid holiday partygoer or energetic host. "This book+absinthe=the best host/hostess gift ever!" she wrote on the card displayed next to the book.
If you want to go for what's hot right now, the  "Holiday 100" display at the Harvard Book Store features 100 titles from a number of different genres. Populated with everything from cookbooks to mystery novels, the display, according to the store's general manager, Carole Horne, is full of titles that, "in the minds of readers and our staff, are the books of the year." This year's collection includes Nate Silver's "The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail—But Some Don't" and Jim Holt's "Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story."
If you're looking for some classics instead, stop by Raven Used Books, where staffers have noticed a surge of interest in old favorites this month. "We're seeing a lot [of people looking for] Emily Dickinson, Anne Sexton, the Russians—Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky— and authors like Salinger and Vonnegut," said Raven employee Kate Hensley.

Feeling festive and need a break from studying that doesn't involve you perusing the depths of the internet or eating your body weight in cereal? Then treat yourself to an excursion to one of the many ice rinks the Boston area has to offer. Although Harvard's ice rink is not currently open due to construction, there are some great options not too far from campus that promise to fulfil all the ice skating dreams you've ever had.The Charles Hotel, Cambridge
Price: $5 adults, $3 children 12 and under; $5 skate rental
Hours: Monday-Friday 4pm-7pm, weekends and holidays 10am-6pm
Practically in Harvard's backyard, the ice rink at The Charles Hotel makes for the perfect seasonal study break. The 2,900-square-foot rink offers plenty of room for a quick spin around the ice, but if you’re feeling more intense, season passes and private lessons are offered. There are also hot and cold beverages and snacks available in case you work up an appetite!
Boston Common Frog Pond
Price: $5 adults, children 13 and under free; $9 adult skate rental, $5 child skate rental
Hours: Mondays 10am-4pm, Tuesday-Thursday 10am-9pm, Friday and Saturday 10am-10pm, Sunday 10am-9pm
With its central location, the ice rink at the Boston Common Frog Pond is always a popular choice. Though all the little kiddos running around can prove frustrating for anyone looking to do some serious skating, the atmosphere and picturesque scenery make it a must-visit. The Frog Pond may be more expensive than some of the other options in the area, but with a college night every Tuesday ($2 admission, 6pm-9pm), it promises to be the best "cheap skate date" in Boston.  The Frog Pond Café is also open during public skating hours and offers a special seasonal menu for adults and children.
Kendall Square Community Ice Rink
Price: $5 adults, $3 students and seniors, $1 children; $8 skate rental
Hours: Monday-Thursday noon-8pm, Fridays noon-9pm, Saturdays 11am-9pm, Sundays 11am-6pm
If you fancy getting away from campus for a while, the community ice skating rink in Kendall Square is just two T-stops away. Less popular than the rink at Boston Common, Kendall may be a better option for more serious skaters who want room to do their thing (if you fancy yourself the next Yuna Kim, this may well be the place for you).
