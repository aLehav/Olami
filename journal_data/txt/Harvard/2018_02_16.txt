After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Aug. 21, 2015, the world watched in shock as Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler thwarted an attempted terrorist attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris. A story of incredible bravery and heroism and of ordinary people doing extraordinary things seems like perfect movie material—so perfect that it caught the eye of director Clint Eastwood. Unfortunately, “The 15:17 to Paris” instead challenges the notion that the big screen was ever the right place to tell this story.

Eastwood pulls out all the stops in one pivotal scene: the attack on the train. The three heroes have repeatedly stated how accurate this recreation of the attack is, beat for beat, and the whole scene does feel incredibly authentic. Shot with steady and handheld cameras on a high-speed train, the attack is suitably chaotic, intense, and terrifying, showing audiences the real danger of the situation and the horrifying tragedy that could have occurred. He re-centers the narrative from the point of view of the three heroes, making the audience understand the adrenaline rush and think-fast nature of the situation.
It’s clear Eastwood knows that this scene is what audiences came to the theater to see because he cuts it up and sprinkles little bits of it throughout the entire film. These abrupt cuts feel like jolts, as if Eastwood were trying to keep the audience from dozing off because he fears that the rest of the film isn’t interesting enough.
Unfortunately, he’s right. Instead of one cohesive movie, “The 15:17 to Paris” instead feels like Eastwood filmed a recreation of the train attack and then tried to build an entire movie around it. Much of this is due to Dorothy Blyskal’s script, which constantly clashes with Eastwood’s direction. Eastwood has always chased authenticity and realism in his films. This one is no different, but Blyskal’s script can’t help but feel manufactured, in terms of writing and story. Because the train attack was an unexpected situation that was thrust upon Stone, Skarlatos, and Sadler, it’s impossible to have any sense of buildup to the attack throughout the film. As a result, most of the film just feels stagnant, with the three heroes just going about their lives and doing mundane things. Blyskal tries to connect the attack with the rest of the film by suggesting that it was fate, not chance, that put the three men on the train that day, but these hints are too clumsily written and blatantly shoved in to create any connective tissue between these story pieces.
Eastwood’s biggest gamble in chasing authenticity was casting Stone, Skarlatos, and Sadler as themselves. The three men really shine when they are just being themselves—saying and doing what they would normally say and do. It’s why the train scene works so well, because the presence of these men adds to the realness. But most times, Blyskal’s writing is so artificial that it requires these three non-actors to act more than they need to, and their inexperience really shows—it feels like they’re reading lines off of the script. Neither the actors nor the script are able to elevate each other. Instead, they bring out each other’s weaknesses.
It’s a shame that “The 15:17 to Paris” doesn’t quite work as a film because it’s incredibly well-intentioned. Eastwood honors the achievements of the three heroes with his perfect recreation of the attack on the train. But one great scene doesn’t make a great movie. The story of these three ordinary men stepping up to do an extraordinary thing is one that needs to be told. But this wasn’t the right way to tell it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is indeed the end of an era. The last installment of the “Fifty Shades” movie trilogy hit theaters Feb. 9. “Fifty Shades Freed” is the continuation of Anastasia and Christian’s love story, now as a married couple. Their life as newlyweds begins with a mystery as Anastasia’s ex-boss, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), steals information from Christian’s company, which initiates ongoing conflict for the couple. In what’s supposedly the “climax” of the trilogy, the film fails to bring much excitement, even with cheesy sex scenes galore, a star-studded soundtrack, and aesthetic splurges. It’s more the same: sex (except they’re married now, and Ana sometimes enjoys being spanked) and the return of the creep who’s now trying to get revenge on Ana and Christian.
Niall Leonard’s predictable screenwriting (not to mention, E.L. James’s flimsy source material) produces a story that lacks energy. Leonard’s screenplay omits several points from James’s book that definitely could have shaped the storyline, namely Ana’s father’s car accident. The remaining scenes, as a result, fails to provide much entertainment. Each scene is set up exactly so that what happens next is never a mystery.
Unimaginative acting fails to redeem the film. Dakota Johnson’s portrayal of Anastasia is naive and ingenuine. With lines like, “Babies happen when we have sex… And we tend to do a lot of that.” It’s hard to blame her, though: Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) is passionate with and obsessively protective of Ana, though whether he actually loves her and is ready for their marriage never comes through. Even at the end, when his mother gives him advice like “Say you’re sorry, and mean it,” his maturity falls short.
Sex in the movie is overly dramatic, making it more laughable than sensual. During Christian’s surprise trip for Ana and friends to Aspen, a nightmare about Jack Hyde’s kidnapping attack on Ana drives her to the kitchen with a tub of Ben and Jerry’s. The ice cream was more than intentional, and soon the scene unwinds into foreplay. Ice cream here, ice cream there, ice cream everywhere. Literally everywhere. Whether the scene was intended to be funny, it had the whole theater laughing.
While the main plot points and characters are not satisfying, the accessory elements of the film—namely, soundtrack and wardrobe—are almost enough to make up for it. Chock-full of the hottest pop and alternative musicians, the soundtrack of the film reinforces the film’s sensual essence. Featuring stars like Liam Payne, Sia, Louis the Child, and Dua Lipa, the new, exciting songs set the mood for various provocative scenes. Notably, Jamie Dornan himself sings the ballad “Maybe I’m Afraid” at the piano on a retreat in Colorado. Although the vocals are shaky, his deep voice is impressive enough for the wooed Anastasia. For the featured song at the end of the movie, the music directors bring back Ellie Goulding’s “Love Me Like You Do,” which was also in the original Fifty Shades of Grey. This song is the perfect nostalgic musical ending to the infamous trilogy as Anastasia reflected on her fondest moments with Christian through flashbacks in the last few minutes of the film.
If the two main characters are billionaires, there better be a fabulous wardrobe. Indeed, designers Shay Cunliffe and Karin Nosella channeled their inner Dior and crafted a wardrobe for Anastasia and Christian that was chic and sophisticated. In particular, Anastasia wowed Christian—and the audience—in a silver “napkin” cocktail dress. Her work wardrobe channeled early 2000s prep, reminiscent of the “Gossip Girl” era: white blouses, string black bows, and incredibly high designer heels.
Despite the splurging thrills of the wardrobe, helicopters, and mansions, the movie lacks the plot development and acting needed for the full ninety minute runtime.

As the caveman tribe in “Early Man” is quick to point out, they are rabbit hunters, not mammoth hunters. These Stone Age characters’ simplicity reflects the arc of the film, as the filmmakers shoot for laughs, rather than deep themes. However, like its characters, “Early Man” maintains a charm that powers the movie through to the end.
The tribe’s attempts at rabbit-hunting show that they are not the sharpest bunch, as the hare they are chasing outwits them at nearly every turn. The protagonist Dug (Eddie Redmayne) is clearly the brightest of the tribe, showcased by his attempt to convince Chief Bobnar (Timothy Spall) that the tribe should hunt for something bigger. In addition to Dug’s superior intelligence, he upholds a strong belief that his people can be more than just rabbit hunters. So when the antagonist Lord Nooth (Tom Hiddleston) from the Bronze Age attempts to annex the tribe’s territory, Dug is quick to challenge the more advanced society to a soccer match for the fate of the cavemen, despite the fact that he and his fellow tribe members have never played the game before.
From the opening sequence, it is abundantly clear that this is a film by Nick Park, the British director who created “Wallace and Gromit” and “Chicken Run.” If the stop-motion animation style was not a dead giveaway, the British cultural references confirm Park’s touch as we see dinosaurs and cavemen brawling, with the subtitle “Earth… near Manchester… around lunchtime.”
The film’s strengths lie in its wide range of humor and the expressiveness of the claymation characters. Hognob, Dug’s pet boar, like Park’s famous character Gromit, lacks the ability to speak, but he is exceptionally emotive nonetheless. He is skeptical of the tribe’s chances in the big match, angry at Lord Nooth as he bad-mouths the Stone Age citizens, and fearful as the Bronze Age soldiers approach. While Gromit is much more of a modern day intellectual, Hognob is a simpler character from a simpler time.
The humor in “Early Man” ranges from slapstick to full-on parody. In one scene, Dug is hit in the face with a large fruit. In another, we see that the Bronze Age version of instant replay involves a crew putting on a puppet show about the soccer players. Wordplay jokes are frequent, some more successful than others. As Dug eats stew, contemplating the tribe’s upcoming match, Chief Bobnar queries, “Not enjoying your primordial soup?” While not every joke is a winner, the variety in humor ensures there are laughs to be had for any age group.
However, the film fails to develop any individual characters other than Dug. Goona, a Bronze Age soccer enthusiast played by Maisie Williams, highlights this weak point in the film. While Goona’s impressive soccer skills push the story forward, her relationship with Dug and the rest of the cavemen is mostly glossed over through a series of montages. Furthermore, the criticism of the antiquated idea that women are not supposed to play soccer in the Bronze Age appears to be a hasty insertion, checking a box rather than actually attempting to create any significant feminist themes. That said, Goona fits well into the ragtag bunch of cavemen in a group setting. The tribe as a whole manages to exude enough charm for anyone to root for them in the end.


“Early Man” is not groundbreaking by any means. The plot is relatively predictable, and the themes of believing in yourself and fighting for respect have been seen in countless films before. However, the film’s humor and delightfulness shine, despite a stumble or two along the way. The filmmakers clearly realize that while they did not catch a mammoth, there is no shame in hunting rabbit if you do it right.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joan Tower is a Grammy-award winning contemporary classical composer and one of the most successful woman composers of all time. This year she turns 80 years old, and to celebrate her incredible lifetime achievements, the New England Conservatory will be featuring her music in a series of concerts this February. In this interview, Tower speaks candidly and humorously about life, composing, and the classical music world.
THC: What’s your composing process like? What inspires you?
JT: Coffee and lots of sleep. “Inspire” is a kind of weird, complex word. What inspires you… hm. It’s more than an idea, it’s a whole confluence of: “Did you get a good night’s sleep? Is your life going ok?” All that always plays a role. Sometimes a player you really love and admire asks you to write a piece—that’s really inspiring. But once you start writing a piece it’s the piece that has to inspire you.
THC:  Is composing difficult?
JT:  For me, it’s torture! For some people it’s a piece of cake. I’m one of the tortured composers. I write very slowly, and I really get into it as deeply as I can, because I want to be as close to the piece as possible to see if I can create a strong narrative and an interesting set of profiles. The work commitment is large. It’s gotten easier since I was 18. I don’t run away as much. “Oh, I just have to change the sheets! I just have to make this phone call. I really have to dust this place, right this very minute!” I do that now a lot less.
THC:  How did you start composing?
JT: By accident. A lot of things in music, or I guess in life, happens by accident or coincidence. When you ask a clarinetist, for example, they often say “How did you choose to play the clarinet?” “Oh it was handed to me at band practice when I was 8 years old because they didn’t have enough clarinets in the band.”
I went to Bennington College, which was a really wonderful place for me because it allowed me to open up and do what I needed to do with music. The first assignment was to write a piece. I was a pianist. I had never written a piece before. So I said, “Oh my God.” So I wrote a piece and it was played, and it was horrible, really horrible. So I thought to myself, “Well, you could do better than that.” So I wrote another piece, and it was still really horrible. And I’ve just been trying to fix it ever since.
It was another way into music and that was fascinating to me. When you’re a performer it’s one way, when you’re a composer it’s another way. I kept the two activities going for a long time and it gave me a lot of insights into music I never had before. Are you a musician?
THC: I play viola. It was also sort of handed to me. I started on violin because my mom wanted me to. I had this really intense violin teacher who said, “You don't practice enough! Switch to viola!” So I did, and I loved it so much more!
JT:  Oh that’s great. I love that instrument. I love it.
THC:  The first time I actually heard your music was when my friend who played your piece, “Wild Purple,” in a studio class.
JT: That’s a hard piece! That’s the hardest of my viola pieces. It changed my relationship to violists and the viola.
THC:  Do you play the viola?
JT: No. I took it up once, bought a cheap viola, got to first position non vibrato.
A person, a very good violist, Paul Neubauer, he just kept after me. The first piece I wrote was “Wild Purple.” Well, that needs a companion piece so I said ok, so I wrote another one, simply “Purple Well.” Now I need a third one for sonata form. So I said’ “Well come on Paul!” So I wrote a third piece called “Purple Rush.” That was played in Lincoln Center last year. The fourth piece was a concerto for viola and orchestra. He put together eight orchestras and played with all of them and recorded it.
THC:  We always need more repertoire.
JT:  What I’ve discovered is when I go to orchestras the violists come up to me and ask me for my autograph. I was shocked by that, because the violinists don’t do that, ever. So now I’ve become president for the Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Violists! Do you know any good viola jokes? I need a good one.
THC: What’s the difference between an onion and a viola? Nobody cries when you cut up a viola.
JT: Oh no, that’s so sad.
THC:  What was it like being a trailblazing woman composer?
JT: That’s a very important question to me—some women composers don’t want to deal with that question at all. I do, actually. I’ve created women’s festivals, and I’m in touch with a lot of women composers. I think you have to know that the history is very bad. Once you know that you’re a little more knowledgeable about your role in this history. You have a historical context. I think it still is an issue. If you look at the orchestral programming there’s not a whole lot of women often or in the repertoire. So the question is not something that can just be solved. Some people say, “Oh, that’s not a problem anymore.”
Then you have to put it in the context of the living composer. The living composer is not treated so well anywhere—in the classical music word, that is. So the question is, we have to make some headway in solving this imbalance. The imbalance in the classical music world is definitely dead vs. living. Somebody said to me yesterday that this one orchestra was only doing one woman composer this year or last year. And I asked him why, and he said, “Oh, they’re not interested in choosing by gender.” And I asked how many living composers that whole year [were women] and he said five out of 73 or something like that. We’re not anywhere near a normal situation here!
THC: Why do you think it’s like that?
JT: I’ve been studying this for 60 years. I think music is very abstract and it has created a kind of a fixed body. The structure of teaching music has gone into conservatory, university and it has changed slightly. The composer only came into the university in the 1960s really. That’s pretty late. They came in under the umbrella of scholarly work. That meant that they had to do theory, write articles on theory, become scholars to become a member of this faculty fraternity. You start to get a lot of smart intellectual composers in the university who can write articles and analyze and things like that.
That’s changed somewhat. It's not such a requirement now to be a scholar to get a university position. In a conservatory, which is heavily dominated by performers, usually the composition side of conservatory is a very small part of it. Performers are dominating that scene, and mostly teachers are interested in creating specialists who play dead composer music. So that kind of started in the early part of the 20th century, a split between composers and performers. In the 19th century a lot of the composers were performers, so they were out front in front of the audience. And the musicologists and books were talking about dead composers, not living, because there had to be some kind of historical context. So when I went to Columbia for fourteen years to get a doctorate, because I wasn’t that interested in it, there were no women in the books. There were like one or two maybe in these heavy colossal books. So in all history of women in music, [women] were kept down for so long. Women were not allowed to do music unless they were in the convent. It’s a pretty pitiful history. It’s changing, though.
It’s gotten so specialized now. It’s narrowed down a lot. So we have a requirement here in Bard that all the performers have to take my class, “Composition for Performers.” Some of them come in kicking and screaming. Some write some very interesting music and play other people’s music. It opens a door to the question of “What is this page—how did it get there?” So that’s an incredibly important part of music education here. They do it at Yale. But they don’t do it in a lot of places. If you’re gonna be a musician you should get around it in different ways, conduct, improvise, compose… not just learn how to play your one instrument.
THC: What do you think about the state of classical music today?
JT: That’s a tough one. I’ve always felt—and this is a maverick idea—that the pop world is a whole lot better off because the performer and composer are often the same person. So you see Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen—you see them in front of you, who happened to create this particular song—not always, sometimes. I think that’s healthy.
Another thing is, mostly you’re dealing with songs and you can start at the age of two, and you can start expressing your feelings through words and sound. Either through rap or through a tune or rhythm, and that creates a different earlier path for untrained people—you know garage bands in the basement. They can go down there and have a lot of fun after school. That’s a very different kind of context for them. Another thing is, people have opinions about it. If you’re a rock person or pop person you’ll have opinions about this singer versus that singer, that guitarist is too loud, that soundtrack is whatever, because you have inside experience with it yourself.
With classical music, a lot of the audience is kind of far away from it, unless they play piano or viola or something that brings them a lot closer. Because a lot of the people in the classical music audiences don’t have that experience and they’re intimidated to have an opinion about Beethoven, for example. To have an opinion about Beethoven—excuse me?! That’s just a very subjective point of view but that’s just one of my theories about it.

Analogies may have received a bad name from being featured on so many devilish standardized exams, but there is a reason we learn about them in elementary school. Analogies take something that couldn’t previously be explained clearly and map it onto something that is already clearly understood by both parties.
The best analogies are simple. Take “intersectionality,” the term for an increasingly popular framework for activism, which says that in order to understand social and political phenomena, people must consider various human identities like race, gender, and sexuality not as separate, but as parts of a complexly tangled web.
That the term uses a basic comparison of intersecting identities to intersecting roads is simple enough to guess. Indeed, Kimberlé W. Crenshaw, a scholar credited with coining “intersectionality,” originally used the analogy to criticize a court’s dismissal of a black woman’s lawsuit of workplace discrimination. The court cited that the company in question hired both blacks and women, but Crenshaw argued that its decision didn’t take into account the woman’s intersectional identity.
As Crenshaw describes, the roads are identities, like race and gender, and the cars on the road are policies affecting those identities. Therefore, someone standing at such an intersection would be hit by traffic from both roads. For example, a black woman hit at the intersection of the roads representing blackness and femaleness would not be able to get help there. As a result, neither a race nor a gender “ambulance” could come along and help her, because they would mistakenly ask which road she belonged on, as if only one identity had jurisdiction over her.
Crenshaw’s point was that we needed to see things in terms of their intersections in order to explain them more effectively. To continue the analogy above, if someone gets hit by a car, it’s not their black side, or their straight side, or their female side, that gets hurt. Human beings cannot literally or metaphorically be divided by their different identities.
In the years since Crenshaw’s 1989 paper, “intersectionality” has taken on a life of its own. It usually shows up as an adjective in front of a movement, as in “intersectional feminism.” Supporters of intersectionality believe that a movement must stand for all the people under its umbrella. Intersectional feminists, for example, want more emphasis on issues that affect non-white, non-middle class women, since they contend that white, well-to-do women have traditionally been the main beneficiaries of feminism. Emphasizing the issues of underrepresented groups within a movement often includes advocating for issues not directly connected to the movement at hand. Thus intersectional feminists make a point to talk about things like LGBTQ rights and Black Lives Matter because, as the leaders of the 2017 Women’s March announced, “Our liberation is bound in each other’s.”
I think that these new uses of the term “intersectionality” are based on a different analogy of intersecting. This analogy positions the individual not as the one being hit and needing to explain what led to her predicament, but as the person with agency. The roads are movements, and each person places herself at the crossroads of the movements she supports.
As a result of this, in recent years, intersectionality has become much more disputed. For example, pro-life women were strongly discouraged from joining in the 2017 Women’s March even if they identified as feminists; seemingly Zionist lesbians were ejected from that year’s Chicago Dyke March. Now, a common complaint of intersectionality that it demands of its members an unfair level of ideological purity, across seemingly disparate issues. I think this type of complaint was bound to arise eventually based on the structure of the analogy itself.
In Crenshaw’s original analogy, the roads were neutral, factual givens, like race and gender, so one couldn’t choose where one stood. Now the roads themselves are political positions, so one can choose where to stand. However, wherever people are given choice, there are inevitably other people trying to take that choice away. These “intersectionality police,” so to speak, dictate where people should or should not stand—in the examples above, they essentially decreed that pro-life women can’t also be feminists and that lesbians can’t carry Jewish pride flags at a pride parade. But there are no objectively correct reasons for either stance.
We are all responsible for our own beliefs, and we should respect each other enough to assume that others have thought through their beliefs too. So it is no wonder that people being told that they have the wrong beliefs are questioning or outright rejecting “intersectionality.”
It is a blessing and a curse that the term “intersectionality” is vague enough to allow so many interpretations of its basic analogy. Crenshaw has admitted as much—while her theory is itself uncontroversial, the term itself has not been. Unlike on standardized tests, no interpretation of “intersectionality” is wrong. But it is also a stretch to say that all interpretations are equally good. It is increasingly clear where the imaginary intersections of intersectionality’s most extreme supporters are located—in a shrinking enclave shifting further and further left on the political map.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In some cases, patients who are diagnosed with severe epilepsy are treated with a surgery that severs the connections between the left and right sides of their brains. In many ways, these individuals have two separate brains that see, hear, and respond to different things.
This division in the brain leads to a body that processes the world as if it were two separate parts, and many fascinating effects can result.
Though I myself have my brain still connected, I can empathize with their position. I find myself in an analogous (if less extreme) situation each day I wake up at Harvard. I grapple with two sides of myself: being gay and being Christian.
I am Two.
I went to Regis High School—an all-boys, Jesuit, Catholic high school in New York City. Despite the Catholic Church’s position that homosexual feelings are an “objective disorder” and homosexual actions are a “moral disorder,” I always felt loved and welcomed. Indeed, Regis exemplified Jesus Christ’s greatest commandment: to “love your neighbor as yourself.”
Over the course of my time at Regis, I came out on a religious retreat as gay; an LGBTQ+ Advocacy Club was formed; I became the club’s co-president; and I had numerous conversations with priests, teachers, and friends about the LGBTQ+ community’s relationship with Christian teaching. Some of my closest friends were against gay marriage, but it didn’t matter: We were all equal in the eyes of God. We all loved each other. Even if at times I was at odds with what many believe to be correct Christian teaching, I could loyally dissent and be considered a valued member of the community.
At Harvard, however, I can’t be both Christian and gay. I am forced to choose.
I am Two.
Recently, Harvard College Faith and Action invited speaker Jackie Hill-Perry, noted for being a self-proclaimed ex-gay hip-hop artist, to campus to speak about “Sexuality and Self-Denial.” LGBTQ+ groups and individuals plan to protest the event in order to challenge her “hateful messages.” While I believe that Hill-Perry has good intentions and that her message is not hateful, it is irrefutably harmful: She is saying that my Christianity means I must change my homosexuality.
Given this invitation, HCFA’s claim in an email to their membership that they do not invite speakers who “support gay conversion therapy” is laughable. Hill-Perry has stated in the past that she believes that God can simply change desires. Of course, such a claim is utterly ridiculous, as scientific evidence has strongly indicated a biological origin for homosexuality. More importantly, however, her language is eerily similar to the logic used by those who support conversion therapy.
In this form of pseudoscientific treatment, “therapists” claim to be able to change sexual orientation and same-sex attraction. Not only does this form of therapy not work, it also harms the individuals who undergo it, significantly increasing the risks of suicide, depression, drug use, and STD infection.
Furthermore, HCFA’s lack of a concurrent invitation of someone who either seeks to have a dialogue with the LGBTQ+ community—such as Fr. James J. Martin, SJ, author of “Building A Bridge”—or has different views on how Christians should view homosexuality—such as Daniel A. Helminiak, author of “What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality”—is concerning. Frankly, it seems to demonstrate a desire by HCFA to indoctrinate its members by providing one viewpoint instead of allowing them to, as stated in the aforementioned email, “commune with each other” and “challenge ourselves.”
Nevertheless, though there were many far less controversial and more effective speakers HCFA could have invited, it would be a mistake to un-invite Hill-Perry. In the words of Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, the best way to combat fallacies and false (even offensive) speech is “more speech, not enforced silence.” Silently protesting the event is a powerful way to engage in this spirit.
Still, it is clear that Christianity at Harvard needs to go to confession. It has forced me and many others to split ourselves in half.
I am the Lorenzo who is out of the closet and proud to be a gay man. The Lorenzo who speaks about the LGBTQ+ community with pride and joy. The Lorenzo who loves his identity and his life.
But I am also the Lorenzo who sits in the pews each Sunday, knowing that he is not welcome the way he is. The Lorenzo who watches as Christian organizations single out what they believe to be his “sin” when we are all sinners. The Lorenzo who hides who he truly is and watches love crumble into the ashes we all will become.
I am Two.

On July 4, 2014, the Macy’s Independence Day Parade played silently in the background, and I could watch in my peripheral vision the balloons gently floating by on the TV.
I tried to say the words, but, no matter how hard I tried, they just wouldn’t come out of my mouth. It was almost as if someone had cupped my mouth. Eventually, I felt as though I couldn’t breathe, and I blurted out the words.
“I’m gay.”
That night, I bawled into oblivion. It was as if a great weight had been lifted. Indeed, it was a religious experience. One that has made me who I am today and put me in the pews each Sunday.
So HCFA, if you really care about us—if you even give an iota of a damn about the struggles we face—then show it. Show that I can be one with who I am.
For the love of God, prove that you care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tonight, Harvard College Faith and Action will host the spoken word and hip-hop artist Jackie Hill-Perry at its weekly large-group gathering, Doxa. Hill-Perry is notable for her identity as a self-proclaimed ex-gay woman who became an active Christian in 2008. Now, she advocates for lesbian and gay people to be saved from their attraction to people of the same sex through conversion therapy. Though we recognize the organization’s right to host the talk with Hill-Perry, we strongly believe that in doing so HCFA gives a platform to homophobia, conversion therapy, and hate.
In a statement released to justify the event, HCFA contends Hill-Perry’s speaking appointment was intended to “discuss broader issues at the intersection of faith and sex” and “foster respectful dialogue about sexual ethics for Christians in the spirit of love and kindness.” Not all students agree, as the event has rightfully sparked significant controversy, with many students planning to attend the event in silent protest of Hill-Perry’s views. We fully support respectful protests of this misguided choice.
We continue to recognize, as we have in the past, that freedom of speech should be upheld on our campus to the full extent to which it is supported by the First Amendment. Everyone has the right to be heard, and Hill-Perry is no different. Of course, that right is guaranteed to both those who protest events as well as those who speak at them. In the case of tonight’s event, the protesters are exercising this right in a far more constructive matter than the speaker.
Hill-Perry’s beliefs represent neither love nor kindness. Her talk extends a harmful narrative targeted at LGBTQ+ students that homosexuality is wrong. In fact, on her website, Hill-Perry claims that she was “saved from a lifestyle of homosexual sin”—hardly creating an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ members of our campus.
Practices that purport to erase homosexuality, like conversion reparative therapy, drive participants to higher rates of depression, mental health problems, and STDs. Victims of this practice are also more likely to attempt suicide and abuse drugs. To say the least, the promotion of this practice is not a productive use of First Amendment rights.
By inviting Hill-Perry to speak, HCFA is presenting inaccurate, misguided beliefs about conversion therapy to its membership. If the group wanted to have a genuinely substantive conversation, they would have done well to have picked a speaker with beliefs in line with the group’s executive team’s stated purpose to “not condone conversion therapy or homophobia.”
Tonight’s Doxa, and HCFA’s intentions in hosting it, cannot be divorced from Hill-Perry’s overt condemnation of the queer community. It is in moments like these that we must remember to use the power of our own free speech to protest that of others to create a more respectful, informative, and open dialogue on campus.

I was scurrying down Prescott Street in late January, caught up in the typical freshman whirlwind of inadequacy and anxiety. Gamely tolerating the icy wind asserting itself under the collar of my coat, I fumbled with my ID, fumbled with my key, and fumbled with my door. I played the same song on repeat, one which had been a life raft in the undertow of my first year of college. I muttered the lyrics absentmindedly under my breath:
I hear the breezes playing
in the trees above
While all the world is saying 
you were meant for love
In the few preceding months, I underwent a complete conversion to a genre of music I had neglected up until that point—the jazz standard. For the uninitiated, this is the music your grandparents make you listen to when Thanksgiving dinner is at their house. Maybe jazz provided a gentle counterweight to the competitive atmosphere of Harvard College, or to my first year living alone, or to the social and emotional floundering endemic to freshman fall. But there was no question: I was infatuated with the bourgeois, uncomplicated, everyday love woven into my playlist.
The interest began when my music nerd friend mentioned Chet Baker, and, irritated by my own ignorance, I immediately set out to make myself an expert. Something in the climate of freshman year sparked my interest in a new and more urgent way. My iTunes library came to resemble less that of a freshman in college and more that of a pensioner: Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday. I collected them, one great musician after another—Sarah Vaughn, Fats Waller, Coltrane.
Beyond the obvious appeal of their music, there was something about the lyrics that nagged at me, catching my interest across vast gaps of time and space. I developed a habit of reading songs before even listening to them. The lyrics all resembled one another in their strong specificity of time and place, teeming with small details which made it seem as if their grand love stories could happen to anyone, including me. The grandiose expectations of lifelong happiness are grounded in small realities, and these kinds of realities were a part of my life.
Tumbling as I was down the rabbit hole of the last century’s music, there was one song I hated completely. Though typically held up as a poster child for the genre, I found “My Funny Valentine” more cruel than kind. It cut against the sort of sentimental ideas I was daily absorbing through my headphones.
Listening to the song for the first time, I was lulled into a false sense of security by its opening line: “You make me smile with my heart.” Here was the warm, goopy sentimentality I had drunk up over the past year. But things quickly took a sharp turn: “Your looks are laughable, unphotographable.” The warmth had shifted to something infinitely more snarky, far more realistic than I cared to hear.
But one day, late on a March afternoon,  I was absentmindedly listening to my playlist when “My Funny Valentine” popped up.  Forgetting my own rule, I listened to it once, then again, then again. For someone steeped in the often-restrictive and self-evaluative world of comp, internships, and endless applications, one can hardly underestimate the relief of hearing the frank confrontation with mediocrity:
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
It was made even better by Chet Baker’s earnest, warm tone, a tone suggesting that answers to those questions were not only known but unimportant. I researched, as I often did, the specific songwriter who had put my subconscious to music and projected my own insecurities so uncannily.
The song is romantic, the songwriter’s life was not. Lorenz Hart, half of the famed Rodgers and Hart songwriting duo, was unmarried, lived with his mother well into adulthood, and died of pneumonia as a result of alcoholism in his late 40s. He considered himself ugly. Hart was a dwarf at less than five feet tall and was even denied enrollment in the US military during World War I as a result of his height. Hart was gay in the 1930s, when homosexuality was not only stigmatized, but also criminalized in most states. Despite his career writing love songs, he never had a long term partner.
Listening to it again, it fell together neatly: I wanted to hear what Hart wanted to hear, and what Hart wanted to hear he poured into the song. “My Funny Valentine” was a clear moment of projection. I can’t count the number of  times I’ve walked around muttering the words of his songs to myself—whether it’s the wit of “My Funny Valentine” or the accessible sentimentality of “Isn’t it Romantic”?
Hart could easily have created something bitter, resentful, and cutting. He knew this music would become part of the lives of everyday people, that radio listeners would fit his lyrics into their own personal narratives. And with this in mind, he did something generous: He chose to project a sentiment in lyrics like “you were meant for love,” suggesting that you in fact deserve this, rather than pulling from his own personal disappointments.
Even decades on, the tender humor of this song has inspired listeners to take it on as part of their personal narratives—just as it has become part of my own.

On the morning after my 10th birthday, my mom, dad, brother, and I drove a rental car down the I-540 from Raleigh-Durham International Airport to Cary, N.C. We’d taken a one-way red eye from San Francisco, and even though my eyes were heavy from the long flight, I couldn’t fall asleep just yet because this small southern town of single-family homes and strip malls was about to make my life new and shiny.
When my family was finally able to afford a house in 2008, we did a lot of Google searches for “good places for families to live.” We found Cary this way—my parents didn’t have already-planned jobs there, nor did they know anyone. Online City-Data research told us, though, that the climate in central North Carolina was close enough to that of my mom’s southern Chinese hometown, the schools had high GreatSchools ratings, and the housing prices were reasonable, so we did it: We bought a house.
Compared to the one-bedroom apartment and then two-bedroom townhouse that my family of four had shared in California, the four-bedroom single-family home we were about to move to in Cary had seemed absolutely ridiculous, but also absolutely wonderful. Before our move, my six-year-old younger brother and I would talk about how we would be living in a mansion complete with a lawn—no earthquakes to protect ourselves from or California drought to keep in mind there. Maybe we could get a trampoline, or even a dog! We could watch the sunflowers in our yard turn toward the sun for the first time. We’d have a fenced yard just like all the fenced yards that I read about in Judy Blume books, and maybe I could have the same cul-de-sac adventures as Sheila the Great.
When I was 10, I loved Cary because it was what I wanted it to be. I arrived there to enroll in my fifth elementary school in five years, but it was the first place where I’d felt some sort of permanence; in my life where everything seemed to be always uprooted in a matter of months, I wanted something to hold on to. The soccer-mom-driving-luxury-SUVs-atmosphere (according to Urban Dictionary’s third entry for “Cary”) was unfamiliar, but at least I knew I would be calling it my life for the foreseeable future. It helped that being in Cary made my life perfect on paper—neighborhood swim team, piano and flute lessons, school lunch that didn’t have to be paid for in cash, the yellow school bus that took me to school every day so that my parents didn’t have to drive.
And in terms of Cary being new for me, I wasn’t alone. When we got there, the houses next to ours were empty and some of them didn’t even exist yet; they were waiting to be bought and built, many by immigrant families like mine who were moving to the suburbs at the end of the recession in search of affordable housing and good public schools. And in this way I was part of not only a city-expansion project but also a demographic change. It’s been ongoing—Cary’s still expanding 10 years later, but I no longer live on the edge of expansion because it’s moved miles out west. My subdivision, once on the edge of suburbia and deciduous forest, is being swallowed by houses popping up on all sides. As time has gone on, it’s become harder and harder for me to see the trees—maybe, in order for the American Dream to be possible for more people, these kinds of sacrifices need to be made.
As time went on, though, I got older, graduated elementary school, and spent less and less time in Cary. I applied to a magnet middle school in central Raleigh and started spending three and a half hours every day on a school bus—one and a half in the morning, two in the afternoon. I was one of the first stops in the morning and the last in the afternoon, so I’d stare out the window and watch the suburbs slowly fade away, listening to Avril Lavigne and Simple Plan and Taylor Swift through those terrible-quality previous-generation Apple earbuds that came with my iPod Touch, and reading Anthony Burgess and J.D. Salinger and Jane Austen. I would relate and hope and convince myself that I was somehow worldly and cultured and complex and knowledgeable, that I was defined by more than just a suburban town in central North Carolina where it felt like the most powerful political organizations were our local elementary-school PTAs. Books made me love Cary when I was 10, but when I was 13, they also began making me fall out of love—you could call it petty teenage angst now, but at the time, I thought it was anything but.
When I stopped going to school with my neighbors and spending all of my time at home, Cary changed for me in more ways than one. It changed from the center of my whole life to a place that I just came back to in the afternoon. It was all I had but then suddenly it wasn’t enough for me. I craved the action and change and mess-ups and fun that came with going to school far away—I fed off of the excitement of leaving the house at six and getting back home at four. I tested into and took Algebra I in sixth grade and got a 79 on my first test, which was the first time I found out that I’d never actually learned how to add or multiply negative numbers because I wrote that three minus five equals three fifths. I stayed in the class anyway.
I didn’t go back to Cary for high school, either. I went to a school in downtown Raleigh, another 30-minute drive, another journey out of the suburbs. My mom and I would drive on two highways every morning listening to Morning Edition on NPR, and at school I learned to like math, and I learned about history and government in a way that I’d never learned about before. I spent my free time learning languages and reading the news and going to the gym for the sole purpose of watching cable TV. I dropped out of high school after my junior year to live abroad under a State Department scholarship. I applied to mostly out-of-state colleges.
***
This winter break, though—my first college winter break—I was back home for a month, the longest period of time I’d been home for almost two years. I made a Spotify playlist called “i’m going home” and went to yoga classes with my mom every day and grocery shopped in H-Mart and the new Whole Foods and sat in Waffle House for hours late at night talking to old friends. I went to countless holiday house parties, walked our dog (who apparently now likes to jump on the trampoline in the fenced backyard), and went hiking in the state parks that now cover former tobacco plantations.
After that initial high, after that initial first love, after almost 10 years of growing further and further from Cary, I was back in the closest place I could get to a hometown, trying to learn about it and love it again. If I don’t hold on to Cary, what else can I hold on to?
This December I was driving at 75 miles per hour on the I-540, the same highway we were on the first night we arrived. Except now, nine years later, it’s a toll road, the state’s reaction to the growing number of employees in Research Triangle Park. And this time, I was driving by myself, just like Christine in “Lady Bird” did, cruising down that empty five-lane highway that I knew so well, and not listening to “Sk8er Boi” anymore.

It’s the spring semester of 1965, and what we would call “cuffing season” in 2018 doesn’t yet have a name. But it’s in full swing.
Picture this: You’re a 20, maybe 21-year-old Harvard boy in your junior year of college—hormonal, kind of a nerd, not really sure how to talk to girls. Cambridge doesn’t yet have shuttles to ease the long trek between Harvard Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle. It also doesn’t help that the College isn’t co-ed and the gender ratio in each of your classes sucks. Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble don’t exist yet; it will be a long 29 years before Harvard’s own Datamatch is developed.
The Radcliffe students who took classes with Harvard boys but lived in the the Quad couldn’t enter the then male-only Lamont Library, but they could get into intercollegiate mixers—if they paid a small fee. These mixers were in basketball-court gymnasiums with DJs playing records inside, and, occasionally, maybe even a live band. Girls came to these mixers from all over: “Wellesley, BU, whatever,” recalls Jeffrey C. Tarr ’66.
Like other 20-year-old boys in 1965, you might have gone to these mixers to meet girls. Tarr and David L. Crump ’66 certainly did. But these mixers were never quite the ideal environment to find a match. “You’d ask yourself, ‘Why am I here?’” Crump says. Harvard boys even ventured as far as an hour-and-a-half off campus for mixers. “It wasn’t uncommon to drive out to Smith back then,” Crump adds.
The main alternative to these mixers was, in Tarr’s words, being “fixed up.”
“Maybe your mother would tell you about someone who was going to a college in the area,” he explains.
***
In the fall of 1965, Tarr and Harvard classmate Vaughan Morrill III ’66 grew tired of the insufficient dating scene. They wanted a better, more surefire way to “fix up” people. Tarr hoped to automatically sort out people who were “not appropriate” for each other.
So Tarr and Morrill created the very first computer-based matchmaking service in the United States. They called it Operation Match. Morrill dropped out of Harvard soon after, but Tarr, who majored in mathematics, hired a “more or less homeless” Cornell University dropout named Douglas H. Ginsberg who would later attend Harvard Law School and become nominated to the Supreme Court. Tarr then solicited the help of his chemistry-major roommate Crump. The three of them—Tarr, Crump, and Ginsberg—managed Compatibility Research Inc., Operation Match’s parent corporation.
To enter, its clients filled out a paper survey with 75 questions about themselves and the same 75 questions about their date’s ideal characteristics. They would then mail their answer sheet to Cambridge along with a $3 fee. Their answers would be recorded on punch cards and run through a room-sized IBM 1401 computer. Three weeks later, the clients would receive a sheet of paper with the names and contact information of their top six matches.
Today, online dating sites are a dime a dozen, but in the 1960s, Operation Match was years ahead of its time. “One in a Million” was printed in big, bold letters at the top of the survey’s second page.
The questions weren’t scientifically designed. The founders sat down, thought about their own dating criteria, and just wrote them. The questions ranged from basic to raunchy—the first edition of the questionnaire asked applicants to pick between one of nine height ranges; what they wanted in their date’s SAT score; whether their race should be “Caucasian,” “Oriental,” “Negro,” or some combination; how much they believed that they were a “conformist;” and whether they were sexually experienced or believed that “romantic love is necessary for successful marriage.” They even added a question about their ideal date’s bra size that they ended up throwing out.
There were also four short-answer situational questions. One question, for example, asked: What would you do if your roommate set you up with an “embarrassingly unattractive” blind date for a big dance? Would you “monopolize your roommate’s date, leaving your roommate with only one noble alternative,” or would you “act very friendly the whole time and run the risk of being trapped into a second date”?
Once the questions had been finalized, Tarr, Ginsberg, and Crump got the word out. They called up local school newspapers and offered them a 10% commission to advertise their product. What started as a side project quickly turned into a full-time job: “First it took 10 hours a week, and then it took 10 hours a day,” says Tarr.
And compared to meeting someone at a mixer, Operation Match did have significant advantages. “You got someone’s name, you could look them up on the facebook, talk to them on the phone,” Crump says. He added that thinking of a conversation starter was easy, because you could simply chat about why you think you matched.
The service quickly became popular, not only on Harvard’s campus and around Boston, but at schools around the country—all the way down to North Carolina and out west toward California. “Every semester, we expanded it because people wanted to do it; there was the demand,” Tarr says. Then, Look magazine decided to feature Operation Match on its 1966 Valentine’s Day cover, boosting its popularity even more. “By the spring semester of my senior year, we must have gotten 100,000 applicants.”
Operation Match wasn’t without competitors. Similar services quickly sprung up around the country. One of them was Contact, Inc., started at MIT. But, according to Operation Match’s founders, their company had a much larger user base. “I think we were annoyed… I never thought about MIT during the years I was at Harvard, and never had contact with people there,” Crump says. Tarr agrees: “I’m sure that they did all right as well, but we were lucky to be the first, and we kind of dominated it… because of the size of our pool.”
***
Tarr and Crump’s college career saw the rise of Operation Match, but it also saw its fall. Soon after Tarr and Crump graduated, Operation Match’s novelty faded. “It was a fad, and it was a big thing for us for a couple of years, and then the interest of it died out,” says Tarr.
“Because of the Vietnam War, if I dropped out of college [to focus on the company], I would have probably been drafted,” says Tarr. “And so, we sold it in two pieces for very little money.”
They sold the first piece to an advertising company called National Student Marketing. They sold the rest to a company that performed the matchmaking process for “single hotels” that would attract customers by “matching up males and females.”
But still, even though it didn’t last forever, Operation Match achieved its goal. “We were able to have a lot of great sexual experiences out of this—you know, we were college guys,” Crump laughed.
“But we went on to do other things. I was a scientific guy, so I went to NASA to be a scientific engineer first, then I went to law school,” he explains. “Jeff went to Wall Street and made money, and so forth. We were no longer pushing the thing, and it died, I guess, a natural death.”
“I would imagine that at Harvard, now, people do all kinds of different things by which to meet people,” Crump says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview last week she still expects to appoint the new deans of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and Harvard Graduate School of Education before her term ends in June.
Both schools have been in search of new deans since Education School Dean James E. Ryan and Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth A. Cohen announced they were stepping down in September 2017 and October 2017, respectively.
“I think those are searches that are well underway and we can accomplish,” Faust said of the dean searches. Faust also said she plans to consult with President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow about her appointments.
Although Faust said she plans to appoint the new deans before the end of her term, she said the exact timeline is still uncertain.
“I always say searches don’t have a timeline, because you’re never sure what kinds of bumps you might meet along the way and how many candidates get named,” Faust said.
“You have to investigate their qualities, and maybe you set your sights on someone, and then it takes that person a long time to make up their mind,” she added. “So there are just a whole series of possibilities that make it always impossible for me to predict the timeline of the search.”
Cohen plans step down on June 30, 2018 to return to teaching and research in Harvard’s Department of History following a year’s sabbatical, while Ryan is stepping down to serve as the next president of the University of Virginia beginning Oct. 1, 2018.

Researchers in the Chemistry department and at Harvard Medical School are exploring new applications for a “bionic leaf” that can generate liquid fuel and other valuable resources using only sunlight, air, and water.
The bionic leaf expands on technology pioneered by Chemistry Professor Daniel G. Nocera. Nocera, formerly a professor at MIT, first created what he called an “artificial leaf” made of silicon. The leaf splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using special catalysts energized by sunlight, producing a chemical fuel that can then be stored and used as an energy source.
Nocera and his colleague, Harvard Medical School Systems Biology Professor Pamela A. Silver, recently took this technology a step further. Working alongside doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, Nocera and Silver developed a bionic leaf that merges the artificial leaf with a genetically engineered bacterium that consumes only hydrogen.

“The bionic leaf is the bacterium working in concert with the artificial leaf, taking the hydrogen plus carbon dioxide and making liquid fuel,” Nocera said. “That’s artificial photosynthesis, and we did it ten times better than nature.”
Beyond its potential as a renewable fuel source, Nocera said the bionic leaf has a variety of other applications. Last year, for example, the research team engineered a special bionic leaf bacterium that takes in nitrogen from the atmosphere and produces fertilizer. This technology is currently being used in Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum to grow crops.
“I have an entire renewable synthesis platform that just uses sunlight and air and water,” Nocera said. “Depending on how you do the biology, I could have it make anything—plastics, maybe inorganic materials, drugs, food—directly.”
Nocera also emphasized the social value of his research, especially in bridging disparities in income and access to resources around the world.
“This type of science we’re doing is really important for the poor, because they don’t live in large, centralized infrastructures and distribution systems,” he said. “I like this research because it’s giving to the poor what we have in the rich part of the world, which is fuels and food.”
“You can do it all in your backyard,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 16, 2018 at 9:10 p.m.
When Cassandra M. Churnside, an assistant coach for the men's and women's water polo teams, agreed to attend classes with her athletes this week, she said she didn’t expect to spend two hours discussing 21st century hook-up culture with her players.
Churnside attended WOMGEN 1225: "Leaning in and Hooking Up," in addition to four statistics and psychology courses, as part of the Harvard Athletics Department’s Coach to Classroom program, which encourages coaches to attend class with their students at the beginning of the spring semester. Approximately 70 coaches participated this year, according to Assistant Director of Athletics Nathan T. Fry.
Men’s tennis Assistant Coach Andrew Y. Rueb ’95 said he started the program, formerly named Back to School Week, seven years ago after an informal poll showed that most coaches knew very little about the academic side of their athletes’ lives.
“I [showed coaches] some photos of some of the great Harvard professors…like Lisa Randall, or Helen Vendler,” Rueb said. “Our numbers in terms of recognizing these faces was not as strong as I think many people thought they would be.”
Rueb said Coach to Classroom was created as way to help coaches see their athletes “outside the lines of their playing fields.”
“We wanted to do a program that would help coaches really learn and sink their teeth into the academic life on campus” Rueb said.
Alexa J. Altchek ’18, a member of the women’s softball team, brought her softball assistant coach Jenny Rohn to AESTHINT 26: "Race, Gender, and Performance" along with a teammate. Altchek said she appreciated being able to show her coach the academic side of her life at Harvard.
“It was a great experience to have her in class to see what our lives are like on the other side of the river,” Altchek wrote in an email. “Our coaching staff cares a lot about our academic lives, and it was exciting to be able to share a part of it with them, even if only for one day!”
Churnside, who attended five classes this year, said  Coach to Classroom gives her the opportunity to see her players learn in a different context.
“Hanging out with the kids, seeing how they take notes, they respond to the lecture, it was really interesting,” Churnside said.
Andrew C. Ball ’19, who attended ANE 120B: "Introduction to the Hebrew Bible" with Rueb, said Coach to Classroom gave him the opportunity to bridge the two sides of his life as a student-athlete.
“Afterwards it kind of gave me an opportunity to introduce my coach to the professor,” Ball said. “It provided me a way to get to know the professor on a more individual level.”
Churnside said one of the things that surprised her most was how eager her athletes were to bring the coaching staff to class.
“It’s almost like elementary school kids when they want to take their parents to back to school night and show you everything they’ve been working on,” Churnside said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign heads into its final months, University President Drew G. Faust has a few more fundraising targets she wants to meet before the campaign’s official conclusion on June 30.
“There are a number of other matters that I would like to see us raise money for: funding for the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration, funding for a number of construction projects,” Faust said in an interview last week.
She also said financial aid fundraising is still a significant priority for campaign organizers. The Crimson reported last month that the overall financial aid goal was still short of its target.
Though certain areas of the campaign are still short of their targets, the overall campaign met its goal of $6.5 billion in April 2016 and has exceeded that amount by over $1.5 billion since.
Faust said a number of Harvard’s schools have their own individual buckets to finish filling and noted there is still time for donors to contribute. On Wednesday, the Medical School announced it had met its goal.
“Different schools have different parts of their school-based goals that they’re trying to complete, so there are a number of questions and opportunities still open for interested donors,” she said.
Faust also reflected on some of what she considers to be the most “memorable” milestones of the campaign. She said she was “so excited” when Richard and Susan Smith committed the funds to renovate the Smith Campus Center, formerly known as the Holyoke Center.
“That meant an enormous amount to me because it’s at the heart of the aspirations of common spaces for the rest of the University and I think it can be an answer to the pressing need for undergraduate social spaces as well,” Faust said.
She said the accumulation of funds for undergraduate House renewal has been “wonderful to watch.” She did not, however, specify any negative aspects of the campaign, citing a desire to wait until it concludes.
“As for shortcomings, I’m not going to admit any until we get to the very end because there may not be,” she said.
Faust also spoke about the ethics of accepting donations. One potential ethical dilemma arose last month when Nan Goldin, a photographer whose work appears in Harvard’s art collection, called on the University to refuse donations from the Sackler family given is association with Purdue Pharmaceuticals, the maker of the controversial and addictive pain medication OxyContin.
Faust said the University maintains a committee to review the ethical implications of certain gifts.
“There’s a gift policy committee that needs to analyze whether a gift is appropriate, whether it comes with expectation of some kind of quid for pro quo — which we do not accept,” she said.
At the time of Goldin’s request, a spokesperson for the Sackler Foundation told The Crimson that Arthur M. Sackler, for whom the museum is named, passed away years before OxyContin came into existence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow said he is interested in creating more opportunities for underresourced communities to access Harvard and its teaching at a press conference on Sunday.
Bacow mentioned the issue in response to a question from the University-run Harvard Gazette about “the role universities can play in a national political environment.”
“Institutions including Harvard need to pay more attention to those in this country who’ve been left behind,” Bacow said.
To achieve this goal, Bacow may choose to leverage the University’s online learning platforms, which include courses hosted through the Division of Continuing Education and edX.
In 2015, Bacow wrote a paper on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which provide remote learners the opportunity to take college-level courses. Bacow and a co-author wrote that online course technology could increase “the availability of exceptionally good education to more of those who can benefit from it” at low marginal costs for universities.
Faculty and administrators at the Division of Continuing Education and edX praised Bacow for his interest in their work.
“Harvard has already been incredibly supportive of what we do, and it is very exciting that Larry has shown such interest,” Anant Agarwal, edX CEO and an MIT professor, said.
Huntington D. Lambert, dean of the Division of Continuing Education, said DCE has studied using online mediums to expand access as early as the '90s, when the division first began experimenting with online course technology. Of the roughly 12,000 total students currently taking courses at the Extension School, 65 percent are taking courses online.
“All of our courses are open access,” Lambert said. “It’s part of the mission to let students come in and try and learn and take a single course without going through an admissions process.”
Lambert said, at DCE, expansion into these communities is his “priority.” One of the ways DCE has been experimenting with broadening its student body is through offering a selection of inexpensive, online courses, according to Lambert.
“There are many people out there capable of doing Harvard-level work and eager to do it who can’t pay Harvard prices,” said Elisa New, an English Professor who offers courses through edX.
Lambert said that, although DCE tries to keep extension school tuition costs as low as possible, the average undergraduate course is $1,550. New said she has been working closely with Lambert to offer lower cost humanities courses to online learners.
“I have been looking to develop affordable, excellent professional development training for teachers as well as excellent college preparatory education for younger learners,” New said. “Dean Lambert has agreed for a period to lower the cost of all of my courses to $200 and so far the result is that we’ve tripled enrollment.”
New added that, although rapidly growing enrollment poses a challenge, she is “confident” that DCE and edX will be able to develop the new infrastructure necessary to handle more students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the #MeToo movement still sweeping the nation, University President Drew G. Faust and the deans of Harvard’s 12 schools spent their most recent deans’ council meeting discussing sexual harassment and how #MeToo might affect the University’s sexual assault policy.
The deans’ council comprises Faust and the deans of all Harvard’s schools; Faust convenes the body on a regular basis to discuss University-wide issues and initiatives. In an interview earlier this month, Faust said that, at the latest meeting, she and the deans even practiced going through some potential sexual harassment cases that might arise at Harvard.
“We also did some cases—made up instances where deans talked about what would you do in this instance,” Faust said. “I think it was a very effective way of pointing out some of the challenges that the deans may face in their capacities as the leaders of their schools.”
More broadly, Faust said the council will seek to prioritize addressing sexual assault at the University going forward.
“A far more important role for this group is to take on big problems like sexual harassment, like Title IX, like conflict of interest issues and policies,” Faust said.
The #MeToo movement has so far focused largely on the entertainment industry, unearthing sexual misconduct perpetrated by media moguls including Harvey Weinstein. But there is action at the university level, too.
Students on campuses across the country have rallied to share concerns over their schools’ sexual assault policies in the wake of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ changes to Title IX guidance. In Sept. 2017, DeVos raised the required standard for proof of guilt in sexual assault cases.
Harvard’s acting Title IX Officer later said DeVos’s decision would not change the University’s policies regarding sexual assault. Harvard currently uses the lowest standard of proof.
Faust said she hoped the #MeToo movement has made clear how important “effective” and “active” listening is when examining issues of sexual harassment and sexual assault. She called on the Harvard community to continue to listen in this manner.
“I do think that this is a changed environment for issues having to do with sexual harassment and that gives us an opportunity to look really hard at our own policies and procedures,” Faust said.
She said the #MeToo movement means Harvard must consider how to ensure sexual misconduct does not occur at the University and that no individuals—whether students, professors, or employees—are “marginalized or demeaned or traumatized” by sexual harassment.
In addition to encouraging Harvard affiliates to be better listeners, Faust also said she hopes the #MeToo movement means those at the University—and elsewhere—will feel more able to speak out.
“If individuals have felt unable to speak, I would hope the MeToo movement has encouraged them to,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 17, 2018 at 4:11 p.m.
Eleven alumni from the Class of 1969 penned a letter to incoming University President Lawrence S. Bacow Thursday criticizing the Harvard Management Company’s investment strategy and urging a more passive approach to University funds.
The alumni suggested Harvard may be losing billions of dollars by trying too hard to manage its endowment. Instead of using hedge funds to manage its money, the University should shift half of its $37.1 billion endowment into lower-cost funds tracking the S&P 500, the letter’s signatories argued.
“We propose a radical new endowment strategy [that will put] the whole management of the endowment on a new basis that would better reflect the values of a great university,” the alumni wrote in the letter.
Alumni who signed the letter include attorneys, journalists, historians, one artist, one clergyman, and two professors, one of whom—Paula Caplan ’69—is an associate at Harvard’s Dubois Research Institute.
The alumni group particularly argued the endowment would have grown faster if it had been invested in the S&P 500 instead of in hedge funds. Had 100 percent of the endowment been invested in the S&P, it would now be valued at more than $90 billion, according to the alumni group.
“If half the endowment… had been in the S&P 500 index, where it would have cost literally nothing to manage, then Harvard would have saved half the payments to Harvard Management, amounting to $68.8 million—enough to pay a $43 million tax bill with a good deal more to spare,” the alumni wrote.
HMC has been actively trying to reverse more than a decade of poor performance. After hiring CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar one year ago and dramatically cutting staff, HMC will still have to deal with a portfolio burdened with poor investments for years to come.
In Dec. 2017, Congressional Republicans passed a new tax bill that will likely force Harvard to pay tens of millions annually in added federal taxes. Experts have said the full impact of this endowment tax remains unclear.
The group has criticized HMC in the past, sending a 2009 letter to President Faust in which they suggested compensation for endowment managers was too high. In Thursday’s letter, the alumni noted they had often petitioned Harvard presidents for change in the past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: February 15, 2018 at 11:23 p.m.
Wielding picket signs and bellowing chants, around 40 students and workers gathered outside the Smith Campus Center Thursday to protest the recent termination of Mayli Shing, a member of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
Shing, a former employee in payroll and finance at University Health Services, lost her job on Feb. 6. According to HUCTW representative Geoffrey Carens, the goal of Thursday’s picket was to convince the University to reverse Shing’s termination, which demonstrators said they believed formed an act of retaliation in response to grievances she expressed at work.
“We want Mayli to be reinstated in a new job with a new supervisor—a full-time job, at least comparable to her previous position, with all the discipline removed from her file,” Carens said.
According to a Facebook post announcing the picket, some of the concerns Shing expressed included claims related to workplace racism and sexual harassment.
“As a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual personnel matters, but all complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment are investigated thoroughly and fairly,” University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement Thursday. “Harvard is committed to maintaining a safe, comfortable, and diverse working environment for all of its employees.”
“We value the contributions of our employees, and have enjoyed a long and productive relationship with our campus unions,” she wrote.
The Harvard No Layoffs Campaign—a caucus of rank-and-file HUCTW members and allies—and the Student Labor Action Movement, a pro-labor undergraduate advocacy group, jointly organized the picket. Demonstrators handed out fliers to Massachusetts Ave. pedestrians explaining Shing’s situation and urging them to contact the University in protest. Carens said they estimate protesters reached about 300 passing pedestrians via this strategy.
For an hour Thursday afternoon, picketers marched in circles in Harvard Square, chanting slogans like, “Harvard workers under attack! What do we do? Stand up, fight back!” and “Hey Harvard, you should know, discrimination’s got to go!”
The event also received support from other labor groups on campus: Members of the Harvard University Dining Services union attended, as did representatives from 32BJ SEIU, the regional union that represents Harvard’s janitors, as well as individuals involved in the campaign to defend Harvard workers with Temporary Protected Status.
Undergraduates lofted signs alongside union members to support Shing. One participant, Noah R. Wagner ’18, wrote in an email to The Crimson that they think the University’s decision to fire Shing is “inexcusable and unacceptable.”
“I stand with Mayli as she continues to fight for dignity, respect, and her livelihood, and the Harvard administration should know that students and workers from across our community stand with her too,” Wagner wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Humanities 10a and 10b, Harvard’s intensive literature introduction courses for freshmen, have gradually evolved from their one semester predecessor—which was arranged around James Joyce's "Ulysses"—to a year-long class that includes a wider variety of authors.
The original team-taught Hum 10 course, offered only for a single semester, was expanded into a two semester series starting in the fall of 2014, according to Stephen J. Greenblatt, one of the course's professors. In extending the length of the class, the professors added a wider selection of books to the syllabus, which they tweak slightly each year. Authors that have been added in recent years include Frederick Douglass, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, and Gabriel García Márquez.
Professor Davíd L. Carrasco joined the course two years ago to teach Castillo’s “The True History of the Conquest of New Spain” and Márquez’s “A Hundred Years of Solitude.”
“What I think has been happening in the last couple of years is that the course is also paying attention to a kind of world humanities approach,” Carrasco said. “I brought in Latin America; we’re having this semester people teaching on China and Japan.”
“But there’s always been a kind of diversification, it’s just becoming more diverse,” he added.
Greenblatt said the change in the reading list was not part of an intentional effort to diversify the texts. He said he likes both the new and old versions of the course.
“One of the wonderful things about having Gabriel García Márquez or Frederick Douglass in the course is actually not because they suddenly diversify what was a group of writers all of whom came from the same background. That wasn’t true,” Greenblatt said. “But because you actually are encouraged to take in how in fact varied, how wildly varied, all of the readings that we’re doing are.”
Some students who are currently in the Hum 10 series said they have mixed opinions on the course and reading list. Alden E. Fossett ’21, said he is “ambivalent” about the course and sees the syllabus as reflecting the “Western Canon” even though it is not advertised as such.
“Right now the description is that it’s a great books class. But when you say it’s a great books class, you inherently say these books are better than other books,” he said.
Fossett said he recognized that the course topics are restricted by limited class time and professors who are available to teach and said he has learned much from the books he has read and from relationships with professors. Fossett also said he wishes the course could be further improved, but that he was not sure how to go about fixing the course’s “problems.”
Carrasco, referring to a group of Mediterranean texts taught in the course, said he thinks it is unfortunate that all the texts have been grouped together under the term “Western Canon.” Within the Mediterranean, he said, there is a wide diversity of religion and ethnicity.
Greenblatt said the authors on the syllabus in previous years were never part of a “cozy little club,” but in fact were quite diverse in background.
Ryan Zhang ’21, another Hum 10 student, said he has enjoyed the comparative aspect of the course.
“It focuses not necessarily on each individual book in its own right, but it emphasizes how the publication of one book has inspired the minds of later thinkers and authors.”
Zhang said he thinks the faculty has done an “amazing job” of including authors of varying geographical backgrounds. He added, though, that he thinks there is some room for improvement in expanding the reading list.
“I think one area where we could do a lot better is including women’s voices,” Zhang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, Harvard women’s basketball will have the unenviable task of trying to rebound from its worst weekend of the season. Unfortunately for the Crimson (13-8, 5-3 Ivy), it will have to do so on the road, which has been the root of most of Harvard’s problems.
The team has limped to a 1-7 road record, scoring merely 56 points per game, a paltry mark compared to the team’s 78 points per game averaged within the friendly confines of Lavietes Pavilion. The Crimson’s road weakness was exposed last weekend, as the team took its first road trip of the Ivy League season.
Bolstered by a 5-1 record good enough for first in the Ancient Eight and in control of its own destiny, Harvard was promptly routed by Princeton and Penn, outscored by fifty points on the weekend. Suddenly, the Crimson sits in third place, tied with Yale, and just a game ahead of fifth-place Dartmouth.
With Cornell, Columbia, and Brown seemingly out of contention, it remains a five-team race for the four spots available at the Ivy League tournament in Philadelphia. Getting to the tournament is essential, as the winner of the four team tournament will punch its ticket to the Big Dance.
Although Harvard’s impressive 10-0 home mark has served the team well thus far, the Crimson has no choice but to scrap for wins on the road, with only two of six remaining games at home.
In fact, with Harvard’s final homestand coming against the conference-leading Quakers and Tigers, the remaining road contests against Brown, Yale, and the Empire State schools become all the more important.
With the season’s biggest road trip looming, the Crimson must take care of business against the Bears and the Bulldogs this weekend. Winning both games, which would firmly cement Harvard into third place and give the team the tournament tiebreaker over Yale, would all but guarantee the team a berth to the Palestra.
Friday night’s tilt in Providence will be a crucial one for the Crimson, which will try to earn its second road win of the year and extend its win streak over Brown to seven. The teams met at the end of January at Lavietes Pavilion, where Harvard recorded its most exciting win of the season, defeating the Bears by a 87-85 score.
The Crimson rode a first-half lead and clutch late defense by junior guard Madeline Raster in the teams’ first meeting, and will be looking to replicate the same formula. Harvard is 11-0 in games in which it leads at halftime, so jumping out to an early start will be essential for the visitors.
The Bears (14-7, 2-6) are a much better team than their record indicates, with two of their conference losses coming by just one possession. Brown, which has produced a solid 6-3 home record, will be looking to cling to its flickering hopes at a tournament berth and will be sure to come out fighting Friday night.
After a quick turnaround, the Crimson will travel to New Haven to take on the rival Bulldogs (12-9, 5-3) on Saturday night, who will eagerly look to avenge a 97-73 blowout in Cambridge on Jan. 26.
Led by Wayland, Mass., native Jen Berkowitz, who leads the Ancient Eight in field goal percentage, Yale has gone 4-1 since its 24-point loss at Harvard. Sweeping the New York schools and defeating Dartmouth, the Bulldogs impressively topped Princeton by a comfortable 14-point margin, and will enter the weekend looking to gain sole control of third place in the conference.
Controlling turnovers, an issue throughout the season for the Crimson, especially on the road, will be crucial if Harvard hopes to beat its rival. Yale leads the League in turnover differential, a troublesome statistic for the Crimson—Harvard turns the ball over almost 17 times per road game and shoots a paltry 33 percent from the field when away from Lavietes Pavilion.
Ultimately, curing its road woes is the only thing standing between Harvard and establishing itself amongst Penn and Princeton as a conference powerhouse. Unbeaten at home since March of last season, even a .500 mark on the road would be enough to firmly solidify the Crimson as one of the Ivy League’s toughest teams.
Unfortunately, going 0-3 on the road in conference play has left Harvard at a critical juncture. To make the Ivy League tournament, and to compete for a chance to go to the NCAA Tournament, the Crimson will have to perform away from home, both this weekend, and in the season’s final weekend when the team will take an arduous trip to New York.
As the team travels to Brown and Yale this weekend, Harvard will have to play with the mentality that matches the reality in front of them. For the team, road wins are not a luxury, but a necessity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the months leading up to the college basketball season, Feb. 17 was supposed to be the Ivy League’s moment in the sun. Harvard and Yale, the top two teams in the conference preseason poll and the league’s biggest rivals, would be going head-to-head in a nationally televised Saturday night game at Lavietes Pavilion. While the matchup between the two schools gets the most attention on the gridiron, the Crimson and Bulldogs have established quite the rivalry on the hardwood.
Harvard and Yale have combined for five of the Ivy League’s last six NCAA Tournament bids, with the Bulldogs ending the Crimson’s four-year run of dominance from 2012-2015. Even though Princeton was the class of the Ivy League a season ago, the matchups between Harvard and Yale, especially the teams’ showdown during the Ivy League Tournament, were some of the conference’s premier games.
Storylines entering the two 2018 matchups abounded. Yale captain Makai Mason, the only player on either team’s roster who played in the Ivy League’s one-game playoff back in 2015, was scheduled to return from a foot injury that sidelined him for all of the 2016-2017 season. The Crimson’s star-studded sophomore class would be going up against Yale’s talented group of second-years in what the Ivy League hopes will be a rivalry in itself for years to come. Harvard would likely still have a bitter taste in its mouth following an unexpected early exit from the inaugural Ivy League Tournament at the hands of the Elis.
Plus, the two teams have largely been the class of the Ancient Eight for the last several years, with intense, every-possession-counts matchups being the norm. Remarkably, entering the season, the Crimson and Bulldogs had split their last eight regular season matchups (point differential: Yale by three), their two meetings at the Palestra (one-game playoff in 2015 and Ivy League Tournament last year, point differential: even), and the ten meetings at Lavietes Pavilion since Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has been at the helm (point differential: Yale by 12). One could say that these teams tend to play each other tight.
To add some proverbial kindling to the fire, Amaker and Yale coach James Jones have a little rivalry of their own. The two headmen play a chess game of x’s and o’s two or three times a year and duke it out on the recruiting trail, with both schools having brought in some of the most heralded recruits in league history in recent years. However, Jones has not always been fond of Amaker’s strategy, saying in 2008 that “[i]t’s eye-opening because there seems to have been a drastic shift in restrictions and regulations with the Harvard admissions office” and “we could not get involved with many of the kids that they are bringing in.” With Jones in charge, Yale has enjoyed playing up, at best, an underdog narrative and, at worse, one of a redheaded stepchild. Jones spent a good chunk of his Ivy League Tournament press conference last season talking about the chip on his team’s shoulder and bemoaning the fact that then-senior forward Sam Downey was not a first or second team All-Ivy selection.
So, there’s your scene for Saturday night. However, things haven’t exactly gone according to plan. Mason has still not played in a game since injuring his foot, Bulldogs star sophomore forward Jordan Bruner is out for the year while reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year Bryce Aiken has been hampered by a knee injury for most of the season for the Crimson. Both teams struggled mightily in nonconference play, with Harvard taking its licks against the likes of Holy Cross and George Washington, and Yale carrying its lackluster play into the beginning of Ivy League action.
However, the teams have been better of late, especially after a weekend in which both clubs went undefeated. The Bulldogs saw sophomore wing Miye Oni win Ivy League Player of the Week honors and received news that Mason may be active this weekend for the first time in nearly 23 months. The Crimson has won seven of its first eight conference games, appears to have turned a corner on the offensive end, and saw breakout performances from sophomores Christian Juzang and Chris Lewis last weekend. Unless something crazy happens over the next three weekends, Harvard will likely be a top-two seed in the Ivy League Tournament for the second straight year. Yale, on the other hand, is in a crowd of five teams separated by one game for the third and fourth spots in the tournament. The Bulldogs, along with Brown, can control their own destiny.
Expect another close game like the one played in New Haven three weekends ago, but don’t hedge your bets on one in which the teams struggle to break 50 points apiece and combine for two field goals in the final five minutes of game action. But don’t be surprised either if there’s another matchup in three weeks in Philadelphia—Harvard and Yale have a strange way of running into one another.
PENN AT COLUMBIA
We think all Columbia University Marching Band jokes have been exhausted.
Just kidding.
Notably absent from the esteemed constitution of this venerable band is any mention of the Quakers. It’s remarkable, really. Every subsection of Article Eight of the band’s constitution makes a witty remark about every institution in the Ivy League. Except Penn.
We’d like to get to the bottom of this, but for the time being we’re pretty sure that the Quakers will not be absent at Friday’s game.
Pick: Penn
BROWN AT HARVARD
Something that hasn’t happened between Brown and Harvard in a long time happened earlier this year.
No, the Bears didn’t end their 17-game losing streak to the Crimson.
That’s right. After years of begging, Brown’s deprived campus finally brought the Harvard Computer Society’s annual iteration of Datamatch to Providence.
As is usual in the Ivy League, though, Brown’s version completely blows. Not only is it limited to Brown students (we heard RISD is where it’s at in Providence) but more importantly, there’s no free food involved. Why anyone would bother to spend the better part of thirty minutes filling it out to not get free food baffles us.
Seventeen games in a row does as well.
Pick: Harvard
YALE AT DARTMOUTH
The top story of The Dartmouth is as follows—Domino’s to open Hanover franchise.
This would be a prime moment to take a shot at the Big Green. Traditional schools of thought would likely reach the conclusion that it’s a sad day when the biggest news in Hanover is the opening of a new Domino’s.
The truth of the matter, though, is that this might be the single greatest thing that’s happened to Dartmouth in a while.
This is not sarcasm.
Where else in America can you get two large two-topping pizzas for $5.99 delivered straight to your door? Nowhere, that’s where.
The only other big news in Hanover is that somehow the Big Green managed to get its first win in conference (after losing seven to start the season) by taking down none other than Princeton. For some reason, though, this was nowhere to be found on the pages of The Dartmouth. Just the Domino’s thing.
The publication has lost all respect from us as has their basketball program for the most part.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
We didn’t mention this before, but not only did Princeton lose to a then-winless Dartmouth squad, they kind of got blown out.
Incredible.
What’s more incredible though is that both of these teams are 3-5 in conference. We have no explanation for this.
Pick: Princeton
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
In what might be the most surprising story of the conference season, Brown is tied with Yale for third in conference. Yes, this is the same Brown squad that was predicted to be bottom-feeding along with Dartmouth at the beginning of the season.
Brown’s star freshman Desmond Cambridge might have tweaked his ankle last weekend, but Dartmouth would have to seriously tweak its roster to come out with a win.
Pick: Brown
PENN AT CORNELL
We calls it like we sees it.
Pick: Penn
PRINCETON AT COLUMBIA
Columbia is Harvard’s lone loss this season and, regardless of the score, it wasn’t a particularly close game if we’re being honest. We’re no experts, but the Lions are honestly contenders to slip in as the four-seed in the conference tournament if they wanted to. Last season, Columbia more or less blew the second half of the conference season and practically opened the gates for Penn to go in its place.
We might be beating a dead horse here, but Princeton lost to a then-winless Dartmouth team last week.
We’ve also come to realize we’re particularly bad at these picks so why not take the supposed underdog.
Pick: Columbia
YALE AT HARVARD
For the first time ever, we’re prepared to talk candidly about how we really feel about Yale.
Well at least one of us is. The truth is that when I stayed over in New Haven four years ago, I was forced into the confines of Timothy Dwight College.
It was the single worst experience of my life.
The floor was just as cold as Yale coach James Jones’ look after the Crimson beat the Bulldogs in New Haven for the second time in a row.
The yoga mat that was my bed was as worn as Yale coach James Jones’ look after the Crimson beat the Bulldogs in New Haven for the second time in a row.
The pizza that they provided was as cold as Yale coach James Jones’ look after the Crimson beat the Bulldogs in New Haven for the second time in a row.
Needless to say, we’re not fans of New Haven and James Jones really isn’t a fan of Harvard.
Also, Timothy Dwight College sucks.
Pick: Harvard

Fresh off an overtime victory in the Beanpot consolation game, the Harvard men's hockey team returns to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for its final weekend in Cambridge this regular season.
The Crimson (11-10-4, 9-6-3 ECAC) takes on St. Lawrence (7-21-2, 3-14-1) on Friday night before honoring its seniors the following night against No. 7/3 Clarkson (19-6-5, 11-3-4) and will be jockeying for a top-four spot in the ECAC standings, with a first-round bye on the line.
Harvard has won the last five meetings against the Saints and most recently enjoyed a 4-3 overtime triumph up in the North Country in January.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team started off senior weekend with a resounding win on the back of a shutout and a hat trick. Both the shutout and the hat trick, however, came from unexpected contributors.
En route to a 5-0 victory against St. Lawrence (7-22-2, 3-15-1 ECAC), the Crimson (12-10-4, 10-6-3) saw the blue line power four of its goals, as sophomore Adam Fox (3–1—4) recorded his first career hat trick. Behind him was another first, as junior goaltender Michael Lackey notched his first-ever shutout.
“I thought it was a good, solid game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We stayed with it…. Both [the special teams] units gave us a great chance to have success tonight.”
A scoreless first period still contained fast, up-and-down play, with a man-advantage chance for each team. The Crimson’s first stab at the power play, which did not score on 17 straight opportunities before Monday’s Beanpot consolation match, looked disjointed. Both goalies made their presences felt, as Lackey stopped the Saints on a few partial breakaways, and visiting junior net-minder Arthur Brey stared down Harvard’s 10 opening-frame shots.
“Although we had played pretty well in the first...the game was going to be decided in the second,” coach Donato said. “We wanted to make sure that we weren’t reacting…. We [wanted] to dictate the tempo and play in their zone.”
That shift in momentum really began to show as the middle third wore on. Halfway through the second period, St. Lawrence sophomore Alex Gilmour boarded Crimson rookie Henry Bowlby from behind in Harvard’s defensive zone, drawing exclamations from the crowd and a whistle from the referee. Gilmour received a five-minute major and a game misconduct for his infraction.
As if the ensuing 5-on-4 weren’t enough to jumpstart the home team’s offense, Saints freshman Eddie Pavlini took an interference penalty, putting the Crimson up by two players for a full two minutes. Fox capitalized on this opportunity, skating into the high slot and throwing a shot through traffic that went bar-down on Brey.
Less than a minute later, Fox nabbed his second strike. The Calgary Flames prospect kept the puck in the St. Lawrence zone, firing it from the high slot again to beat Brey blocker-side. The second tally gave Fox his first career multi-goal game.
“There’s no question that [Fox] is a very gifted, talented player,” coach Donato said. “He was a little bit snakebit early on in the year…[and] just didn’t show up on the scoresheet as much as he’s used to. He’s one of the most electric offensive players in the country from the blue line.”
Harvard and the Saints continued to trade both opportunities and penalties, but after 40 minutes the Crimson held its 2-0 lead. Early in the third, Harvard went on the power play once again. And once again, it was a defenseman who beat Brey. This time, freshman Reilly Walsh was the culprit, converting on a shot from the blue-line.
The Crimson wasn’t done scoring yet, even as St. Lawrence swapped Brey between the pipes with freshman Cameron Gray. From behind the net, sophomore forward Nathan Krusko fed rookie linemate Henry Bowlby in the slot. Bowlby tried to chip one past Gray, and when that failed, he backhanded his own rebound into the net.
The tally was surely satisfying for the rookie, who was jostling with the Saints defensive corps all night for position in front of the cage.
Finally, Fox put the icing on the cake for Harvard late in the third, tapping in a cross-ice pass from senior forward Seb Lloyd. The hat trick, a career-first for Fox, also marked the first by a Crimson defenseman since Danny Biega ’13 notched three goals in Jan. 2011.
“It wasn’t on my mind too much,” Fox said dismissively. “I’ve never been much of a goal-scorer. [But] it’s nice to get a few goals.”
St. Lawrence had a power play opportunity in the last minute of the game, but Lackey shut down the visitors to preserve his shutout. Though Harvard kept the puck away from Lackey for most of the game, letting only 16 attempts get through to him, the netminder was forced to make several dramatic saves on shorthanded opportunities.
Coach Donato has been reluctant to commit to a single goalie this season, and Lackey’s solid play will make his choice all the more difficult. Whether the coaching staff sticks with Lackey after Friday’s performance or returns to tri-captain Merrick Madsen remains to be seen.
“On any given night, we want to play who we think gives us the best chance to win,” said coach Donato, reiterating the philosophy that he has preached to this point in the year. “We have faith in [Madsen] and in [Lackey]. I’m not a one-goalie guy.”
The five-goal night featured a perfect penalty kill by the Crimson and 50% efficiency on the power play—a special teams success by any measure. The squad also tossed 39 shots at the opposing net, while attempting 75. For a team that has both struggled to ink the scoresheet recently and is missing its offensive centerpiece due to the Olympics, the attacking numbers from Friday’s game look promising as Harvard enters its last few conference matchups.
“We felt like we weren’t getting enough pucks on secondhand opportunities,” said Fox of the power play’s recent issues. “That change for us was big, and it’s been clicking for us so far.”
While bottom-dweller St. Lawrence does not pose a threat in the conference standings, the win gives the Crimson a valuable two points, inching closer to third-place Clarkson. And none other than the No. 7/3 Golden Knights visit Cambridge on Saturday in Harvard’s last home game of the regular season and final chance for the Crimson to test itself against a ranked opponent.
“[Clarkson] should be ornery after not getting any points up in Hanover,” said coach Donato, referring to the Golden Knights’ upset loss at Dartmouth on Friday. “It’s a nice chance for us to challenge ourselves with a team that’s been one of the top teams in the country.”

Sure, a select few Harvard students may have significant others (yes, we’ve seen your obnoxiously cute Instagram posts). But the rest of us will be putting all of our hope into computer algorithms and free food for this year’s long-awaited Datamatch. The algorithm only does so much, but with a few quick steps even you, an awkward, washed-up high school valedictorian, can make a Datamatch date successful.
Research the hell out of your date
You’ll basically become a human bot, a walking encyclopedia on their life. This way, you’ll never run out of conversation topics. Get them to talk about their favorite books, the best places they’ve traveled to and, most importantly, why they went to prom with another person in 2014, four years before they even met you. Seriously, is commitment going to be a problem?
Hint that you could be their Harvard Daddy/Mommy
Casually mention the private island you grew up on and don’t forget to namedrop your parents. However, that might alienate the many Harvard students who invest a lot of energy into pretending they’re not snakes, so for now, just promise them a stable future full of free Felipe’s burritos.
Invite them over to “see your common room”
Never mind the fact that you actually live in a hallway double, from which you hastily exiled your roommate just seconds ago via a desperate text. If you’re confident in your ~abilities~ and your date is up for it, why not shed the shyness and start your romance with some passion?
Treat them like trash
In a twisted, masochistic way, we always desire the people who forget about us, never text back, and don’t have time for us. So, go ahead and take advantage of this strange contradiction in human psychology. You’ll have your Datamatch date asking the most quintessential Harvard question: Why am I not good enough?
Oh well, if Datamatch (or our advice) fails you, there’s always discounted chocolate from CVS.
