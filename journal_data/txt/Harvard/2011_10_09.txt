After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The winning streak ended on Saturday night for the Harvard women’s volleyball team (9-6, 2-3 Ivy), who fell to the undefeated Yale Bulldogs (11-4, 5-0) in straight sets. The Crimson was coming off of a win against Brown on Friday night, but was not able to muster an offensive attack to challenge Yale, who posted a .306 hitting percentage on the night. Harvard fell by a score of 17-25, 21-25, 20-25.
Yale took control of the match beginning with the opening set, posting an early 11-6 lead in the frame. The Crimson fought back to come within two, at 17-15, but couldn’t overtake the Bulldogs, who pulled out a 25-17 game win.
The second set was much of the same between the two opponents, with Yale earning and keeping the lead from whistle to whistle. Despite the consistency of the Bulldogs' play, Harvard again got within two, but Yale never gave the the Crimson the chance to finish the comeback, recording two kills and a block for the win.
The Bulldogs dominated the third and final set, leading by as much as six to take the game 25-20 and blank the visiting Crimson. Yale’s Mollie Rogers’ led all players with 14 kills in the win. Junior Taylor Docter let Harvard with 12 kills and a .324 hitting percentage, while Natalie Doyle posted her fourth consecutive double-double with 33 assists and 10 digs. Co-captain Christine Wu recorded a game-high 18 digs in the loss.
“Yale is obviously a good team and it was difficult for us to respond to their level of play,” Wu said. “We lost in three [games], but we saw a lot of good things that we can capitalize on ... next time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It will be a long drive back from Ithaca for the Harvard men’s soccer team tonight.
Although the Crimson (2-7-1, 0-2-0 Ivy) entered the second half with a  1-0 advantage over Cornell (6-1-3, 2-0-0), the Big Red needed only  fifteen minutes to notch three consecutive goals, taking back the lead  to come away with a 3-1 victory Saturday afternoon.
“The result was a little bit disappointing,” senior co-captain Tim  Linden said. “We performed well for parts of the game and really  underperformed for parts of the game. We can’t fault anybody for effort,  but it comes down to being sharp mentally and physically and taking  care of the job, which we weren’t able to do for 90 minutes.”
Harvard started out strong in the first half, shutting down the  Cornell offense and creating several scoring chances. After 32 minutes  of play, sophomore defender Ross Friedman sent a free kick into the box,  and sophomore defender Oblajulu Agha collected the ball and finished  the opportunity to put the Crimson on the scoreboard and enter halftime  with the lead.
But after the first fifteen minutes of the second half, Harvard's  lead had disappeared. The Big Red targeted the center of the Harvard  defense, capitalizing on breakdowns to put the ball away. Tying the game  off a breakaway less than three minutes into the half, two more goals  quickly followed, and the Crimson was unable to come back from the  deficit in the remainder of the period.
Cornell outshot Harvard, 13-11 (7-3 on net), while the Crimson led in  corner kicks, 4-2. Goalkeeper Austin Harms recorded four saves for the  match.
“We entered into halftime with a lot of confidence,” Harvard coach  Carl Junot said. “We thought we had done well and had executed our game  plan… If I look at the game as a whole, it was probably 75 minutes of a  decent performance to our team. There were those 15 minutes where, for  whatever reason, we couldn’t figure out the center of our defense, to  the credit of Cornell, who was very good with [targeting] it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the home opener for Harvard men’s water polo against MIT Friday night, fans on both sides wore a myriad of school t-shirts supporting their team. One MIT fan even slipped on a full-body spandex suit for the occasion.
But for Saturday’s game against Brown, both sides shared a common color: pink.
In the first-annual Breast Cancer Awareness Game, athletes from both Harvard and Brown wore customized commemorative swimsuits in an attempt to raise awareness and money for breast cancer research.
“In my memory, I don’t know of any two men’s teams who have had something like this,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “That was my whole thought—I wanted our men to bring awareness to something that does not affect them as much as much as women.”
Members of the women’s water polo team collected donations during the game, and information about the disease was presented over the intercom before the game and during halftime.
For some of the players, the game took on a powerful meaning.
“We have a couple of guys on the team whose parents have had breast cancer,” junior Max Eliot said after the game. “Thankfully, they have all been breast cancer survivors.  It’s a great cause and we’re happy to support it.”
Freshman John Holland-McCowan agreed, saying he was proud his team was so willing to support the event.
“My grandmother has cancer and she is suffering from that right now,” Holland-McCoawn said. “It was a personal game for me to feel like we could take a moment, as Harvard water polo, and recognize that there is such a thing going on in the world right now and we can try to make an impact.
“Although it may be small token to the overall problem,” he continued, “I was very proud of our team and of Brown’s team to do this with us.”

The Harvard football team's 41-31 victory over Cornell wasn't the only exciting part of Saturday's game. During the third quarter, actor and "Saturday Night Live" alum Bill Murray made a surprise appearance in the bleachers after the band finished playing theme song "Ghostbusters" from Murray's popular film of the same name.
"This guy in pink pants walked up and said, 'Hey, play that song again,'" said Harvard University Band Manager Rachel L. Hawkins '12. Hawkins said that the band had no idea Murray was at the game and that "Ghostbusters" is just part of their usual set list. "He kind of appeared out of nowhere. It was very serendipitous."
Once Murray returned to his seat to watch the last quarter of the game, the trombone section pointed itself in his direction and played the theme song for him one more time. At the end of the game, Murray reappeared and treated the band to a special performance. "We were playing our fight songs, and he came over and started mock-conducting us," Hawkins said.
According to band member Sebastian Gomez '14, Murray attended the game with James M. Downey '74, a "Saturday Night Live" writer and the uncle of Robert Downey Jr. Gomez, who spoke with Downey, said that Murray had flown to Syracuse from Charleston to see the game with his friend. Murray and Downey both posed for photos with the band after the game.

Nassim Kerkache likes to get to work early. Supervisor of the Harvard Yard Mail Center, he rises at 4:30 a.m. every morning so he can arrive on campus by 6:00 a.m. "I don’t start till 8:00 a.m. or 8:30 a.m., but I come anyway," he said. "I love this job."
Originally from Algeria, Kerkache moved to the United States in 1994. "Love brought me to America," he said, declining to divulge any further explanation. His second day in the country, Kerkache signed up for English as a Second Language classes and began looking for work. "I worked at Stop & Shop for a month; I worked for two months in a bakery in Watertown … I worked at Harvard Law School—as a counselor to the lawyers," he said with a laugh. Eventually, however, Kerkache found a lasting home at the Harvard Yard Mail Center, where he has worked for the past 15 years.
"I liked it here, so I stayed here," Kerkache said. Initially hired as a casual employee, Kerkache worked his way up from the part-time position. "Now, I am a general with three stars." Perhaps no other general responds to the call of duty quite as enthusiastically as Kerkache. Commuting an hour from his home in Cumberland, Rhode Island, he arrives at the mail center each morning ready to work. "I open the place up, I start checking e-mails from Harvard, and I wait for the happy faces," he said, referring to his co-workers.
Indeed, it is the happy faces and camaraderie among the mail center employees that Kerkache said makes his job more fun. "We have a very enjoyable atmosphere here. That's the personalities of the others and myself," he said. "We all get along." Kerkache also enjoys the diverse backgrounds of his co-workers, who hail from the Dominican Republic, Senegal, and America. "It makes it so spicy. It's a very good taste when you have people from all over the world."
The colorful personalities and friendly atmosphere of the mail center—a place where banter and laughter flow freely—have also allowed Kerkache and his co-workers to form unique friendships with students living in the Yard. "We love them, and they love us," Kerkache said. "Sometimes they don’t have any packages, and they just come to say hello." And while seeing freshmen leave the Yard each May is sad, Kerkache said that many continue to stop by the mail center even after they have moved into upper-class houses. "They keep coming to visit—they like it," he said. "They're great. A lot better than Yale University students."
With colorful co-workers, friendly students, and the occasional canoes and car parts that come through the mail center, Kerkache said that he loves "everything" about his job. "There is no place, no department like this department. I love it here. Harvard is everything I love. That's why I come here so early."
