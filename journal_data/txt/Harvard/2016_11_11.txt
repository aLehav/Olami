After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From outside the job-seeking process for soon-to-be graduates, I like to imagine Harvard seniors as if they were participating in some dating ritual with jobs instead of people. However, the ritual seems to have gone amiss in setting students up for short-term jobs instead of long-term careers.
As the jobs dating ritual goes, each senior has his or her own taste in an ideal “date.” Everyone puts themselves out there by telling potential suitors about their past experiences and common interests with similar suitors to show that a relationship could work.  And when seniors do get pursued, it is with food and gifts—just look at any tech recruiting event for uncanny dating parallels.
Right now, two of my senior roommates are going through the motions of this job dating process. One is a computer science concentrator who hopes to pivot into public service-oriented jobs; the other is on track to get a bioengineering degree and wants to break into scientific research. Yet both see that the bulk of job opportunities come from what I’ve come to think of as the Big Three: finance, tech, and consulting.
Generally speaking, I think finance, tech, and consulting are good places to learn while remaining flexible to move into a different career path. But it is no secret that Harvard has an interesting relationship with the Big Three: of the Harvard grads that would matriculate to a job in 2016, 53% would be entering a job in finance, tech, or consulting as their first, but only 15% of the same pool of grads thought they would remain in these industries after 10 years. Looking at just consulting, only 1% of Harvard grads think they will be in the industry in 10 years. Compare this to the 21% of seniors going into consulting after graduation and it would be hard to believe that seniors are making the long-term careers that they want by starting in industries they know they will abandon.
In other words, getting a job with the Big Three is akin to settling down with a partner who seems good for you now but might not be worthy of a lasting relationship.
Harvard’s primary matchmaking efforts seem relatively okay with letting this dynamic dominate. This year, 88 companies were tabled at the Campus Interview Program Fair; only 13 of these operated outside the businesses of finance, tech, or consulting. And finance and consulting are the only industries that have more than the standard single Office of Career Services-organized fair, not counting their dominance in the Campus Interview Program Fair.
This scenario mimics the quintessential chicken-and-egg problem in terms of figuring out why the Big Three dominate on campus; the Big Three are aggressive in recruiting and courting Harvard students, but students and Harvard are also receptive to their advances and benefits. With all those involved knowing what they’re getting themselves into, it might be hard to say anything might be amiss.
When it comes to jobs, maybe people should believe something along the lines of “all policy’s fair in love and war,” as one knows what they are getting themselves into when they love or wage war.  But such a belief is grounded in the idea that that the consequential things in life merely come from decisions people make based on the desires that they have.
Contrasting this idea with the fact that many Harvard seniors are going into fields that they don’t see a future in leads me to believe something has gone amiss. The job dating ritual at Harvard has lost sight of what is at stake: finding jobs that allow us to immediately live the lives we want to lead into the future.
However, there are glimpses of what job seeking could look like at Harvard. For one, there can be a greater focus not just on the job opportunities that are offered to us, but on the expectations of the jobs we want.
I have been lucky enough to take a class with a professor who encouraged each of his students to think deeply about careers that they would like to pursue and how they want to live their lives after college. This kind of thinking is necessary in order to develop strong expectations so that we demand jobs directly related to our future careers after college ends. If we took our demands and expectations seriously, I think we would choose to go into first jobs that we see our futures in and not necessarily into jobs in the Big Three industries.
In addition to encouraging the development of such demands, Harvard could meet demand by providing a diverse set of jobs opportunities. Only two years ago did Harvard start making efforts to bring public-service oriented jobs to campus in an organized way. And I hope such an effort will lead to similar initiatives in more fields.
If we took expectations for our future working life more seriously, and if Harvard met those expectations, these glimpses could turn a rather unsatisfactory job-seeking ritual into one that immediately puts us on a path to lead the lives we want now rather in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students and professors continue to take stock of the results of Tuesday’s election, the ideological uniformity of much of Harvard’s population will no doubt dominate campus conversation. Honing in on Harvard’s undergraduates, The Crimson’s pre-election survey affirmed—to an extent—the College’s reputation as a liberal bastion. While we should use caution in using these results to make blanket assumptions about all academic and social contexts in which students discuss politics, the survey points to an overall lack of ideological diversity that should concern faculty, administrators, and students alike, especially at this moment in our history.
The most glaring ideological diversity deficit among undergraduates is the relatively small number of students who identify as conservative. In the election survey, fewer than 13 percent of respondents described themselves as “somewhat” or “very” conservative, compared to over 70 percent describing themselves as “somewhat” or “very” liberal.
In contrast, when a Gallup poll early this year asked Americans to describe themselves as “very liberal,” “liberal,” “conservative,” “very conservative,” or “moderate,” a plurality—37 percent—picked one of the two conservative options, while 35 percent chose “moderate.” In The Crimson’s survey, only 16 percent of respondents picked “moderate.” Most striking, in the Gallup survey, only 24 percent picked one of the liberal choices.
Similarly, while nearly 48 percent of Americans voted for Donald J. Trump in his victory on Tuesday, just 6 percent of undergraduate respondents to The Crimson’s survey preferred him. This number stands in stark contrast to the 35 percent of millennials nationwide who cast their ballots for the President-elect—a testament to his divisiveness, but also a reflection of the insularity of the Harvard bubble.
The causes of this ideological imbalance are likely as varied as the reasons people choose to attend Harvard in the first place, and it would be unrealistic to expect our campus to exactly mirror the political divisions of the country at any given moment. But when the disconnect has grown to such proportions, diversifying political expression in all settings ought to become an administrative priority. The pursuit of “Veritas” which undergirds our intellectual life demands not only that each member of our community be able to debate politics freely, but also that we attend to the multitude of political views that exist in our nation. Stifling this discussion on campus is a disservice to our peers in the campus political minority, and to our own educational growth.
In the same vein, administrators and faculty should take active steps to ensure that students of all political stripes feel comfortable voicing their ideas, especially in the classroom. Concretely, this effort will likely involve actively encouraging the airing of different views, and curtailing unnecessary or inappropriate expressions of political favor by professors. Guaranteeing that more conservative professors teach in subject areas that clearly lean liberal, like the humanities, is also crucial.
This is not to say that Harvard should simply shift its discourse rightwards; the need may differ from department to department.  In economics, for instance, more political views from the radical left would likely enrich our intellectual experience in the same way as more conservative views would in the humanities.
Ultimately, this week’s surprises have underscored Harvard students’ need to understand those who disagree with us, however strongly we feel that their views would lead to catastrophe or injustice. Though Harvard will never perfectly reflect the American public’s political composition—nor should it seek to—Harvard students are not exempt from remaining in touch with reality.

Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States of America. These were not words that I ever wanted to hear, much less say to myself. And as I write this, the enormity of this statement has not fully hit me. I ended election night, in a crowded dorm room, surrounded by friends—many of whom have more to lose than even I do, as a woman of color. And the magnitude of this decision, made by the people, for the people of the United States carries with it a shocking finality. Black and brown bodies, female bodies, gay, trans, and lesbian bodies were ultimately just that: Bodies. A living, breathing pile of bodies on top of which Donald Trump built his campaign. And if Donald Trump makes good on his campaign promises, there is every chance that our bodies will not be safe, that our identities will not be accepted, and that our very personhood will be continually oppressed. Yet the terrifying permanence of this conclusion only raises an even graver question.
What has gone so deeply wrong with our great American experiment that nearly half this nation feels so much vitriol, fear, and hatred towards the “other” half of America?
When Donald Trump said Mexicans are "rapists”, this sentiment of racism apparently resonated with Americans. When Donald Trump excused sexual harassment and assault as “locker room talk”, this sentiment of misogyny seemed reasonable to Americans. When Donald Trump promised to ban Muslims from America, this sentiment of xenophobia struck a chord. And this embrace of extremist rhetoric extended beyond the top of the ticket. When Mike Pence was revealed to embrace conversion therapy, a substantial portion of Americans were apparently unconcerned. The list of morally unacceptable views espoused by Donald Trump and Mike Pence goes on, and on, and on—but the disappointing truth is that a large portion of Americans evidently espoused these views too, if only in the privacy of the ballot box. Half of America not only accepted these hateful statements, but also felt invigorated and inspired by this bigotry—enough so at least to believe that a presidential ticket built on these views was well suited to be the next leaders of the free world.
And this revelation—that a good half of all Americans do not stand with me, do not stand with people like me, but instead stand with a man who rose to the power of the presidency on a wave of mistrust and hatred towards the “other” —is sad. It is scary. It is shocking. But most of all, it has to be motivation for those of us who see an alternative future for America.
Today, I am reminded more than ever, of the words of the poet Dylan Thomas: “Do not go gentle into that good night/...Rage, rage, against the dying of the light.” In many ways, it seems as if this nation has entered the darkness of the night; but now is the time for us to fight harder, and harder still, for values that we truly want to represent America—tolerance, integrity, and acceptance. There are countless local—and national—elections that will play out in the coming months and years that represent real and tangible opportunities to effect grassroots change. We will win those elections; and we will win the fight. In 2018, we will reclaim the House and the Senate from the ever-extending arms of prejudice that have seized it. In 2020, we will take back the White House from the stranglehold of vitriol currently grasping it. But all this will only happen if we commit now to channeling our oppression into political capital, if we commit to using our collective voices to drown out the power of hatred and bigotry that Donald Trump has brought to the forefront of politics and of the American psyche. As citizens who believe in Hillary Clinton’s vision for America, and feel President Obama’s hope for America—we can never, ever, ever, forget the horror we felt at hearing the words, “Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States of America.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 11, 2016, at 1:46 a.m.
Harvard may be facing another campus strike.
The University's janitors voted overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of authorizing a strike should they fail to reach an agreement by next Tuesday, less than a month Harvard’s dining workers ended their own weeks-long picketing.
According to Eugenio H. Villasante, a spokesperson for 32BJ SEIU—the union that represents Harvard’s custodial staff,  the vote was conducted by “acclamation,” meaning members vocally indicated their support of the strike. Villasante said only 16 union members were against the idea of a work stoppage, and “hundreds” of members voted in favor.
The union’s current contract with the University ends Nov. 15. They began bargaining with Harvard Oct. 7.
Should the janitors strike, their action would come less than a month after the conclusion of a 22-day work stoppage by Harvard’s dining service workers, who rallied to increase wages and maintain their health benefits package. That strike rocked campus, resulting in the shutdown of several of the University’s dining facilities and drawing national media attention.
In a press release, Roxana Rivera, the vice president of 32BJ SEIU wrote that “the janitors who help to keep Harvard at the top are ready to do what it takes to protect their families and their communities.”
After the vote, union members marched from the Science Center through Harvard Yard, carrying signs that read “good jobs, strong communities” and “ready to strike.”
Rafael Torres, a custodial employee, said the workers were rallying for increased salaries and what they consider more affordable healthcare. He compared 32BJ SEIU’s goals to those of the dining workers.
“But almost we fight for the same things,” Torres said. “If the dining hall workers won, why don’t we win?”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that “Harvard has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with SEIU,” adding that their wages are “highly competitive in local markets.”
The press released stated the union is “demanding a path to much needed full-time jobs,” echoing one of the biggest proposals that Harvard’s dining service workers rallied behind last month. While HUDS did not secure full-time work for all of their employees, The University agreed to create a summer stipend program in which employees available to work during the summer could be paid up to $3,000.
Other issues at hand in SEIU’s contract talks include discussions about the union’s health care plan and wage increases for the workers. In an interview in early October, Rivera said the union’s current health plan differs from other campus unions in that workers do not receive their benefits directly from the University, but rather from a fund SEIU maintains. Harvard allocates money into that fund, though Rivera did not specify how much.
Under the proposals SEIU put forth, Harvard would have to “contribute a little bit more” to the health care fund than it does currently, Rivera said.
According to deLuzuriaga, the average salary for Harvard’s janitors is $22.07 per hour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the annual Harvard-Yale football game approaching, House Committees have partnered with the Office of Student Life and the Undergraduate Council to organize upperclassman House neighborhood tailgates.
The pre-game events are modeled after this past spring semester’s pre-Yardfest block parties, and organizers say they hope to create larger and more welcoming gameday tailgates. Prior to this year, the tailgates were organized by each House.
According to Winthrop HoCo co-chair Matthew T. Disorbo ’17, the tailgates will take place on Nov. 19 on the tennis courts by Harvard Stadium, and will feature food, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as prizes and giveaways.
Mather House Committee co-chair Trevor A. Mullin ’17 said the HoCos decided to join forces because of the potential for more efficient planning and higher student attendance. He also noted the collaboration more generally stems from a recent push to promote House life at the College.
“Your social experience at Harvard should be centered around House life," he said. "It’s something that affects us all and I strive to make positive contributions to that and know that the College has similar goals.”
Organizers also said they hope to provide an alternative to tailgates hosted by campus organizations, especially in light of ongoing discussions at the College about social spaces and the role of the final clubs in the College’s social scene.
“It’s nice to have a totally inclusive tailgate,” Disorbo said. “You have a ton of these final club tailgates and Greek life tailgates which I’m sure are fun, but a tailgate that someone can feel comfortable going to and knowing they’re always welcome at is really important.”
Madeleine H. Stern ’18, the UC’s Student Initiatives Committee chair, echoed Disorbo’s sentiments.
“We also want to ensure that while many other groups do their own thing, people that aren’t a part of those groups also have a place to go where they can have the same kind of tailgate ‘get excited’ experience,” she said.
Adams HoCo co-chair Cecilia Laguarda ’17  said she hopes the tailgates will help promote school spirit.
“What was weird with the individual House tailgates is that Harvard-Yale is this one day… to be really proud of being a Harvard student and so the fact that we always had these individual House tailgates seemed strange,” she said.
Laguarda also emphasized the financial benefits of combining tailgates by neighborhood.
“We’re hoping that the ability to pool three Houses’ budgets as well as hopefully additional funding from the UC and OSL, will give us more interesting and varied snack options,” she said.
HoCos are financing the tailgates through their own Harvard-Yale budgets, with support from OSL and the UC.
“The OSL is pleased to support the HoCos as they plan a fun tailgating experience for students,”  Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich wrote in an email.
Stern said the UC gave the Houses a total of $5,000 for the tailgates in the hopes of promoting spirit across campus.
“We really wanted to celebrate the fact that is is one of the times on this campus that we can and should have a lot of school pride that goes beyond neighborhoods and Houses,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A hotly debated piece of papyrus at Harvard that could help answer whether Jesus had a wife has been largely accepted as a forgery by the media and the woman who championed its cause.
But for that same woman, a professor who has spent the past four years studying the small scrap of papyrus, the frenzy has distracted from the broader issues.
Four years ago, a man named Walter Fritz approached Harvard Divinity professor Karen L. King with a scrap of papyrus containing a line written in Coptic that read, “Jesus said to them, ‘My wife… she is able to be my disciple.’” King named the scrap the “Gospel of Jesus’s Wife” and publicly introduced it at a 2012 conference in Rome.
The discovery caused an immediate and international sensation, making the front page of various newspapers. However, while the discovery was widely covered, media outlets questioned the authenticity of the papyrus.
King defended the papyrus against allegations of forgery for years until The Atlantic published an investigative story in June questioning the papyrus’ provenance, or record of ownership.
In an interview with King, the first woman to hold the University’s oldest endowed professorship chair, she said reading The Atlantic article led her to relief. “Truth makes me calm,” she said.
“My first impulse was to say that the preponderance of evidence weighs towards it being authentic,” King said. “Now it weighs toward it being a modern production.”
At Harvard, the issue of the scrap’s authenticity is still up for debate. According to William P. Stoneman, curator of early books and manuscripts at Houghton Library, where the papyrus will be stored for 10 years for research, “the Harvard Library has not taken a position on its authenticity or meaning.”
The reason the fragment is “the most studied piece of papyrus in existence,” as King called it, relates to the implications many believe it has for Christian history.
“The public perception is that if the text is ancient, Jesus was married. If not, he wasn’t,” King said.
But, according to King, the issue is not that simple.
“The New Testament simply does not say whether Jesus was married or not,” she said. “It isn’t until the second century that you have the first evidence of somebody saying Jesus was not married. Those people were called heretics.”
King said the scroll, which indicates Jesus was married, has been contested because it opens up a dialogue on patriarchy, whether women could serve as disciples, priestly celibacy, and the value of virginity.
“It’s about the nature of sexuality and men having authority—only men can be disciples and followers of Jesus, be ordained, and provide leadership,” she said.
According to King, “the most significant development” resulting from the papyrus was the formation of the Ancient Ink Laboratory at Columbia University and that lab’s subsequent discovery of a nondestructive technique to date ancient inks.
Director of the Ancient Ink Laboratory Jim T. Yardley said the lab created a “totally unprecedented” method of dating manuscripts by analyzing tiny ink samples with a “scanning electron microscope.”
Typical radiocarbon dating involves cutting off an actual portion of the document and measuring the isotopic ratios of carbon atoms found in the carbon dioxide.
Both tests were performed on the “Gospel of Jesus’s Wife,” and conflicting results emerged.
“There’s a problem,” Yardley said. “The ink is from 200 AD, while the carbon 14 test says the document is from 700 AD. The age of the ink could be younger than the substrate, but it can’t be older.”
King said she regrets the story is “turning into a popular hot story of scandal,” and hopes the scrap will broaden dialogue of its pertinent topics.
“Focus on whether it’s a forgery or not is taking attention off the things that really matter, which are the issues about authority, women’s roles, sexuality, and everything attached to them,” she said.

Two Harvard alumni and longtime friends are swapping textbooks for cookbooks and pencils for poke bowls.
James M. Acer ’14 and Josiah B. Bonsey ’14 are opening Manoa, Hawaii-inspired poke bowl restaurant in Somerville, near Porter Square. Acer said the restaurant, which is named after a neighborhood in Honolulu, will open in several weeks pending final approval on a few permits.
“We think we have something that’s really unique and hopefully that people will respond to,” Bonsey said.
According to Bonsey, Manoa’s signature menu item will be a traditional poke bowl. A poke bowl contains a rice or quinoa base and a fish, usually tuna or salmon. Acer said customers can add toppings to the bowl and even “douse it in wonton chips and soy sauce.”
Other menu items will include kalua pig and spam musubi, Bonsey said.
“Basically, we want to serve the type of food that you would eat at a luau in Hawaii,” Bonsey said.
Born in Massachusetts, Bonsey lived with his family in Hawaii until he was in middle school. Bonsey said the restaurant is inspired by the food he ate while living there.
“My brother Sam and I had just been back to Hawaii to visit some friends and family and we were eating a ton of poke and were thinking, ‘It’s crazy that no one does this on the mainland,’” he said.
Upon returning home and after some research, Bonsey discovered that Boston is an important city for the tuna trade. Realizing there were few Hawaiian restaurants in the Boston area, Bonsey decided to open a food truck featuring Hawaiian-themed dishes, he said. After several months of trying to open a food truck, however, Bonsey decided it “wasn’t going to be viable” and turned towards opening Manoa, a full-time restaurant.
Bonsey said he has been working toward opening Manoa for about two years and Acer for about four months. Acer joined the Manoa team over the summer after spending two years working for a consulting firm in New York City.
“It is very very different than working on the 20th floor of some big skyscraper in New York City,” Acer said of starting in the restaurant business. “The joys of it are much greater and the challenges are much different.”
Camille M. Bean ’20 was enthusiastic about the prospect of having a poke shop on the east coast.
“I’m from California and poke is already really popular over there, so I’ll be excited to have it over here,” she said.

As Harvard's Republicans are acknowledging and accepting the reality of Donald Trump's upset victory, the College's Democrats are not quite ready to unite behind the new President-elect.
The Harvard Republican Club made waves in August by denouncing Trump as a “threat to the survival of the Republic,” the first time it has not supported GOP presidential nominee since its founding in 1888. However, club President Declan P. Garvey ’17 said he now hopes for a successful Trump administration.
“I’ve made my thoughts on Trump’s campaign and his candidacy clear over the course of the past few months,” Garvey said. “That being said, I of course respect the outcome of the election and hope and pray that [Trump] does a good job as president.”
In contrast, the Harvard Democrats still processing Trump's victory.
“The time to talk about political strategy will be next week or next month—however long it takes for us to get over the shock," said Susan X. Wang ’17, the president of the Harvard Democrats. “It will be soon, but not right now,."
Trump’s victory spurred sadness and disbelief among many Harvard students on a campus where a Crimson survey found 87 percent support Democrat Hillary Clinton. Only six percent of respondents to the survey said they would vote for Trump.
Spontaneous protests have erupted across many university campuses. The Daily Bruin student newspaper for the University of California, Los Angeles estimated that more than 1,000 UCLA students marched through campus and the surrounding streets in the early hours Wednesday morning after it became apparent Trump had won. Similar protests erupted at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, University of Pittsburgh, and Texas A&M. In Boston, thousands of people protested Trump Wednesday evening.
Garvey said that, while he understands the feeling of protesters and recognizes that as a white male Trump’s victory will affect him differently, he considered such divisions after the election “unproductive.”
“Politics aside, what makes our country unique is our respect for the democratic process and that’s what we need to do,” he said. “Ultimately, we need to come around and respect the fact that Trump won, whether we supported that or opposed it.”
Still, Garvey sympathized with Democrats who are shocked and saddened by the election results.
“It’s definitely a tough turnaround,” he said. “As Republicans, we had to confront the reality of Trump representing us for months. Democrats are kind of just reaching that point now.”
The Democrats are moving forward, still frightened by the prospect of a Trump presidency but hopeful from the energy of the opposition they have seen thus far.
“It’s scary for us, and scary for a lot of people on campus—for family, friends, and the people that they love,” Wang said. She added though,“It’s exciting that there’s still the energy there, and I hope they keep that energy up in the coming months and years,” Wang said.
Moving forward, Garvey said he expects the Harvard Republican Club not to acquiesce to the “Trumpist style of politics of bigotry,” adding the club would support the president-elect on policies that they agreed with him on—Supreme Court appointments and lower corporate taxes, for example—and stand up against “his more extreme policies.” He also said the Republicans will lead the way in trying to understand why Trump won.
Wang, on the other hand, said that in the immediate aftermath of the surprising election, “The Dems as a community is just trying to come together and support each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Chief of Staff for University President Drew G. Faust wrote in a letter to the Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda that Harvard Law School will not reserve spots for students from the country as compensation for a 19th century Harvard donor’s ownership of Antiguan slaves.
Last month, inspired by Georgetown University’s decision to grant preferred admission status to the descendants of its former slaves, the Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States, Sir Ronald Sanders, sent a letter to Faust calling on Harvard to adopt a similar program. Sanders proposed that Harvard provide benefits to Antiguans and Barbudans, including annual scholarships to the Law School. In a Nov. 3 letter, Faust's Chief of Staff Lars P.K. Madsen responded that the University’s admissions policy does not allow such preferential treatment.
“The admissions committee does not have quotas of any kind whether they be ethnic, geographic, socioeconomic, or any other factor one might consider in admissions,” Madsen wrote.
In his original October letter, Sanders argued that Antiguan and Barbudan slave labor helped establish Harvard Law School. A 19th-century bequest by Isaac Royall, Jr. established a professorship of law at Harvard in 1815—the beginning of a law department that eventually evolved into the Law School. Royall’s owned slaves at farms in Massachusetts and a sugar plantation in Antigua, which was the source of his wealth.
In his response to Sanders, Madsen defended the University’s commitment to diversity in its admissions process and outlined the College’s and Law School’s need-based financial aid programs. While encouraging people from Antigua and Barbuda to apply, Madsen wrote that admissions officers do not offer geographical preferences to candidates.
“Geography is not a major factor in the committee’s admissions decisions, but you may be interested to know that we extensively recruit students from diverse areas of the world, including from Caribbean nations,” he wrote. “Having outlined these policies for your information, it is my sincere hope, which I know is shared by both President Faust and Dean Minow, that qualified students from Antigua and Barbuda, and from the Caribbean region, will continue to apply to Harvard College, to Harvard Law School, and to our other academic units.”
Madsen also outlined a series of steps the University has already taken to confront its historic connections to slavery, including the creation of a  plaque for the four slaves who worked at Harvard and the removal of the Law School’s seal—formerly the Royall family crest.

About 100 students, faculty, and staff from several of Harvard’s schools chanted and heard speeches around University Hall Thursday to protest Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election.
Reclaim Harvard Law—a student activist group at the Law School—organized the rally, dubbed “Harvard Against Hate.” Congregated around the John Harvard statue,  students, activists, a custodial worker, and Cambridge city government representatives spoke about their reactions to Trump’s victory and called on Harvard affiliates to take action in response. They also urged attendees to support Harvard’s custodians’ demands in their ongoing contract negotiations with the University.
Second-year Law student and Reclaim Harvard Law organizer Collin P. Poirot led attendees in chants of “Stand up, fight back”—a common refrain during last month’s dining services workers’ strike—and “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go.”
“A lot of people woke up on Wednesday in a country that basically told them that they hate them,” Poirot said in an interview. “So I thought that having a space and a rally where people could come together as a community and show that you’re not alone... we’re prepared to fight back against that kind of racism and bigotry that Trump has normalized—but which has been around for a long time—is really important.”
Some attendees said they attended the rally looking for support and tangible ways of redirecting their energy when, in their opinion, the national political system no longer appeared to be a viable channel.
“We’re really just here to express our frustration and to hopefully move beyond just being disappointed,” second-year Law student Audrey Adu-Appiah said. “As Law students, I think we have to find a renewed purpose.”
Speakers at the rally pointed to local government and community action as the best vehicles for change. Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem Mazen condemned national politicians and urged attendees—particularly women and minorities who have felt excluded from the political process—to get involved in local politics.
As the Law School group led the protest on one side of Harvard Yard, members of Harvard’s custodial staff marched from the Science Center to Massachusetts Hall before joining the rally at University Hall. On Thursday, custodial workers authorized a vote to strike if their union and Harvard do not reach an agreement before Nov. 15.
Rally organizers drew connections between issues of minority rights raised by Trump’s victory and the movement from Harvard’s custodial staff.
“We can’t keep thinking of elections as the time to make change, and actually the most important change is what we struggle for in our local communities,” Poirot said. “And the way to do that at Harvard is to support the workers’ struggle just like we did with the HUDS strike, to support custodial workers, to support students of color on this campus, supporting tuition equity for undocumented students.”
One custodial worker spoke to rally attendees in Spanish as a Reclaim Harvard Law member translated. Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons expressed her support for Cambridge residents and Harvard janitors.
“I’m here in a show of solidarity to stand with you,” Simmons said. “I will walk with you, I will rally with you, and when you strike, I will stand for you.”
Reclaim Harvard Law member said the group has shifted its focus from activism to improving the environment for minority students at the Law School to supporting workers’ movements across the University this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty and students discussed empathy as a means of bridging societal divides, especially in light of the recent election, at the Divinity School on Thursday.
The event, titled “Cultivating Community Across Divides in the US: Relationship Building As a Spiritual Practice,” was hosted the Divinity School’s Religions and the Practice of Peace Initiative. Though the event was planned before Election Day, President-elect Donald Trump’s unexpected victory shifted the focus of the event to understanding the factors behind the result.
The panelists recommended different spiritual and religious approaches for dealing with an increasingly polarized America.
Matthew L. Potts, an assistant professor at the Divinity School, discussed the grief that many Americans expressed following the election. He said that the process of grieving was a spiritual one because it allows humans to comprehend loss.
Some discussed the immediate emotions and issues facing many Americans. Divinity School professor Stephanie Paulsell emphasized the spiritual obligation to continue to support and protect marginalized groups and minorities.
Other panelists looked for comfort through their own cultural backgrounds.
Elizabeth Ruqaiyyah Lee-Hood, moderator of the panel and a Ph.D candidate at the University, recommended the tenets of patience and self-reflection in times of uncertainty, drawing lessons from her Islamic background.
Hugh O’Doherty, a lecturer at the Kennedy School, drew comparisons with his native Ireland, where people around him saw the English as the enemy. He encouraged the audience to reflect on the idea that groups define themselves by designating an “other.”
“Even though all the great spiritual traditions communicate that we are one—and we all know this in our deepest heart of hearts—somehow, we separate,” he said.
Melissa W. Bartholomew, a Ph.D candidate at Boston College’s School of Social Work, discussed remembrance as a spiritual comfort. She said she drew hope from understanding how her ancestors, who were slaves, endured for their families and descendants.
“We must engage in remembering the painful past as a spiritual practice, and we also must remember how we made it through,” she said.
Attendees said they found solace in the panelists’ messages of understanding and pushing forward positively. Local resident Carly Nix said she supported the idea of finding common ground between people of different perspectives.
“Being able to be present, see yourself reflected in the ‘other,’ and find common ground is very important,” she said.
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton, who introduced the panelists, cautioned against assuming negative intentions in those who hold different political views.
“To ascribe the worst into others is a spiritually damaging thing to do,” he said.

Political commentators Bill Kristol ’73 and William A. Galston analyzed the unprecedented outcome of the recent election of President-elect Donald Trump at an event Thursday.
“Post-Election Roundup,” a biennial bipartisan event hosted by the Center for American Political Studies and the Program on Constitutional Government, also featured remarks by Boston College professor Susan M. Shell and a discussion moderated by Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53.
Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Clinton administration adviser, began the discussion emphasizing the role that the need for change played in shaping the election.
“The single biggest block in the electorate gave pride of place to a candidate who could ‘bring about change,’ and that is where Mr. Trump won the election,” Galston said. “You know, in an odd way, Donald Trump’s campaign was the mirror image of Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008. A promise of change, details to come.”
Kristol, editor of conservative-leaning magazine The Weekly Standard, agreed with Galston’s take, saying that the political message of change pushed Trump over the edge.
“When people are in the mood for change, it’s hard to stand up against it,” Kristol said. “I always said that if Trump were going to win, it was going to be because the desire for change overcame the hesitation about Trump personally.”
In his remarks, Kristol also added that Trump’s message was successful at personally connecting with voters.
“The one thing I thought he did very well, was he said Hillary Clinton’s slogan is ‘I’m with Her’ and my slogan is ‘I’m with you,’” Kristol said.
Shell, who is the chair of the Political Science Department at Boston College, discussed how Trump’s message tapped into feelings of anxiety present in many voters.
“Trump’s uncivil and frequently outrageous assaults against political correctness were wildly effective, I think, in their implicit promise of honorable redemption,” Shell said.
Shell, who organizers originally assigned to comment on the election of America’s first woman president, also discussed issues with government welfare.
“People want respect more than they want handouts,” Shell said. “Handouts can be a symbol of respect, a share of the spoils, as you were, that one deserves, or they can be the opposite, a sign that one is pitiable. I think that Democrats across the board have tended to ignore this fact.”
After the four-hour event that included both presentations and dinner, attendees remained puzzled over how to deal with American voters’ decision.
David Shiple, a healthcare consultant who said he attended the event to hear Kristol, expressed his perplexion over attacks on the Trump voters.
“You have 60 million Americans who did something that people did not expect, and it can’t be just described and called high school education mites or bigotry,” Shiple said. “I mean, 60 million people voted for Trump, so you can’t just explain that away by saying these people are idiots.”

As part of its participation in the Pac-12 China Game this week in Shanghai, the Harvard men’s basketball team worked with children from the Yao Foundation on Thursday afternoon during the team’s visit to Shanghai Disney. The game’s partnership with the foundation is a new addition to the activities surrounding the contest between the Crimson and Stanford, which will be played at noon on Saturday (GMT+8) at Mercedes-Benz Arena.
“Yao Ming has been perhaps one of the world’s greatest ambassadors for the sport of basketball and he’s been a friend and a great supporter of these efforts to bring the best of US basketball, particularly intercollegiate basketball, to China, to expose the best of amateur basketball in the United States to a Chinese audience,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said.
The Yao Foundation was established in 2008 by Yao Ming, the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft, an eight-time NBA all-star, and a 2016 NBA Hall of Fame inductee, following a massive earthquake in China’s Sichuan Province.
The Sichuan Province sits in southwest China, approximately 1,000 miles west of Shanghai, Yao’s hometown. The earthquake that struck the area in May of 2008 registered as an 8.0 on the Richter Scale and was the 21st-deadliest earthquake in history, claiming nearly 70,000 lives.
Yao began the foundation to rebuild schools for children affected by the disaster. According to its website, over the past eight years, the Yao Foundation has expanded to focus on “the well-being and development of Chinese youth, primarily with regards to education, health, environmental protection, volunteerism and engagement.”
The Pac-12 is one of many organizations that has partnered with the Yao Foundation. It works alongside the China Youth Development Fund and has received support from the Houston Rockets and the team’s owner, Les Alexander, Reebok, former Houston Mayor Bill White, and NBA stars Baron Davis, Raymond Felton, and Steve Nash.
“It’s an important part of education for our student-athletes and an important part of that is teaching them to be responsible leaders that give back and Yao Ming is a great example of an iconic sports star that has taken seriously the idea of social responsibility and wanting to give back,” Scott said.
Students from the foundation had lunch with members of the Harvard and Stanford teams at the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel on Thursday. Several will also be at Mercedes-Benz Arena on Saturday. Additionally, a portion of tickets sales from the game will go to the foundation.
“This week I think has been a tremendous opportunity to develop our scholar-athletes,” Stanford coach Jerod Haase said. “Our interaction with the Chinese culture has been phenomenal.”
Yao is an iconic figure throughout Shanghai and all of China. Since retiring from the NBA in 2011, he has worked to give back to his home country through philanthropy as well as various business ventures. Yao has taken courses at Jiao Tong University, a Federation of University Sports of China school involved with the Pac-12 Global Initiative, and purchased his former Chinese Basketball Association team, the Shanghai Sharks.
“We’ve been very inspired by Yao’s vision about being about to use popularity, his status as a role model in China, to bring good and to bring opportunity to children and to bring awareness to causes to improve society here in China,” Scott said. “It’s very consistent with the values that our universities have, which are about training the world’s next leaders, and sport is an important part of that.”
Former UCLA star Bill Walton spent time interacting with children from the Yao Foundation during the teams’ trip to Disney. The children posed for pictures with the teams and had VIP access for a parade down Main Street at Shanghai Disney, for which Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and co-captains Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller were marshals.
“This is the first year we’re doing it and we’ll look forward to building upon this over the years, but we’re delighted to have a close friendship and partnership with Yao and to support his activities here in China.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though they are known for their academics, athletics at Harvard and Stanford are nothing to scoff at. Harvard has the most Division I teams in the country, with 42, while Stanford has won the Director’s Cup—an award given to the nation’s top collegiate athletics program—for 22 consecutive years.
This week, Harvard and Stanford men’s basketball teams are spreading the success of collegiate athletics away from Cambridge and Palo Alto and instead are representing their schools in Shanghai, China. The week culminates in the two teams facing off in their NCAA season opener, but the goals of the trip go far beyond the action on the floor.
As part of Pac-12 Global, the Pac-12 China Game is the crowning glory of the Pac-12’s Globalization Initiative. The China Game commenced as an annual event last season as Washington and Texas faced off, with the Huskies winning 77-71. But in the week prior to the game, the Pac-12 seeks to encourage a greater emphasis on university athletics in China.
To achieve this goal, the Pac-12 has partnered with the Federation of University Sports of China (FUSC), which is the solely authorized national organization for university sports. The President of FUSC, Yang Liguo, joined Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott at Shanghai Disneyland Hotel on Thursday to discuss the potential for the U.S.-China partnership.
“We really strongly believe in the mission of the FUSC, which is to promote exchanges from university sports associations from around the world,” Scott said. “Over the past five years, we’ve not only been able to host competitions and friendly exhibitions, but also participate in coaching clinics and other educational exchanges between our two countries…and building upon the people-to-people exchange between China and the U.S. through collegiate sports.”
Both Harvard and Stanford competed in exhibitions with FUSC teams on Wednesday. Stanford came away with a 98-56 win over Tsinghau, with junior Reid Travis—brother of former Harvard basketball player Jonah Travis ‘15—leading the charge with 20 points. Similarly, Harvard defeated Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 84-64, led by Corey Johnson with 17 points.
Liguo discussed the possibility of mimicking the professional-like style of collegiate sports in the U.S., referring to them as “scientific” in structure.
“[Universities are] not just a place to cultivate talent, it’s a place to cultivate sports talent,” Liguo said through a translation device.
While FUSC leaders have come to the U.S. to learn more about the Pac-12 system, the Pac-12 has also sent coaches and athletes to China to teach more about the game, creating a coaching education alliance. In September, the University of Utah, Arizona State University, and the FUSC kicked off three months worth of coaching clinics in men’s and women’s basketball, track and field, swimming, and cheerleading. The clinics will involve subjects such as game preparation, practice structure, and film review.
“We know the U.S. is a big country for sports,” Liguo said. “They start early and have great result, and we also want to learn that. Exchange coaches and players, invite American coaches to coach Chinese students, help to accelerate the speed of cultivating excellent athletes at the university.”
The message of the significance of university athletics is especially potent with Stanford and Harvard, as the two schools have shown that it is possible to have strong academics and athletics simultaneously.
“One of the great opportunities that we have with the Pac-12 China game is to build on the great academic reputations of the two best universities in the world by showcasing their athletic strength as well in the sport of basketball,” Scott said. “We are expecting this game to be very close and very exciting, a great example of the caliber of basketball at U.S. universities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­This weekend at the NCAA Regionals, the Harvard women’s cross country team, along with sophomore Kieran Tuntivate from the men’s team, will look to continue to make history two weeks after a strong showing at Heps in which the women placed first.
At Heps, the men’s team, led by Tuntivate’s 18th place finish with a time of 24:16.8, finished eighth with 194 points. Rounding out the men’s team, senior Brandon Price finished 20th, freshman Murimi Nyamu 62nd, freshman Will Battershill 68th, and junior Tyler Spear 73rd.
Junior Courtney Smith, who won the individual title with a time of 20:19.6 and was named to the All-Ivy first team as well as the No. 6 individual runner in the nation in the FloTrack rankings, helped lead the women’s team its first Heps title since 1985. Smith’s finish was the first individual title for the Crimson since Suzanne Jones in 1989.
Rounding out the women’s results, freshman Erin Dietz finished fifth, freshman Judy Pendergast sixth, freshman Lisa Tertsch ninth, and junior Elianna Shwayder 12th.
“It was very exciting to win the Ivy league championships,” Harvard coach Patrick Wales-Dinan said. “I think we’re just trying to have fun each day and get better each week. We’re really happy with the direction things are going and we just want to keep improving.”
Now, after a couple of weeks of rest, the team will hope to recreate its performance and best its sixth-place finish from last year as it visits the historic Van Cortland Park in N.Y. on Friday to compete in the regional tournament.
The women’s 6k race starts first, at 11 a.m., followed by the men’s 8k race an hour later at noon.
In the most recent U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association poll, the women have Harvard moved up No. 18 in the nation, while the men have failed to crack the top-25 all season long. The Crimson has had an up and down season thus far, but have appreciated and grown from the learning opportunities along the way.
“The season has been a steady learning process” Shwayder said. “Learning how to approach competition together as a team and individually. We have made a really strong pact in learning to build off of each other’s strengths.”
They will have to build upon everything they’ve learned when running on this course, which has been known to test the best runners in the region with its hilly terrain.
The Crimson, though, is approaching this challenge as it has all others this season: with a cool head and calm mindset.
“Coach Patrick’s main mantra has been that this is nothing spectacular; you don’t need to go out and have an unbelievable day,” Shwayder said. “You just have to do what you’ve been training for and what you’re capable of. If we perform as we are capable of, we’ll perform well collectively.”
At the NCAA New England Regional tournament, the top two teams qualify for the national NCAA tournament. In total, there are nine regions around the nation, allowing for 18 teams to be selected. In addition, 13 “at-large” teams are chosen for the tournament, by means of a complex selection process predicted by the Kolas Calculator. In order to qualify for nationals, the team knows that it needs to put its best foot forward in the competition.
“Regionals is just one more step along the way,” Shwayder said. “We’re just trusting the process. We know from last tournament that we are an incredibly strong team. But it’s not just one result or race that makes you believe what you’re capable of. We just want to put ourselves out there in the mix and run hard.”
Harvard is expected to match up with 40 of New England’s best schools. This includes No. 3 Providence, the highest ranked of the Crimson’s potential opponents, which is expected to present a formidable challenge to the team. Coming into the tournament, however, Harvard has an 8-3 record against ranked opponents, and  knows that it can hold its own with the competition.
“We’re excited, we just want to go out and run our best,” Wales-Dinan said. “If we put a good performance together we’ll be pleased with the result because we’re a competitive group.
The team share’s its coach’s sentiments heading into the pivotal weekend tournament.
“Our group is just so confident,” Shwayder said. “There is no question in our mind that we know what we’re capable of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard football has never won four straight Ivy League titles. Period.
Tonight at 8 p.m., the Crimson (7-1, 5-0 Ivy) has a chance to change that. Squaring off against second-place Penn (5-3, 4-1 Ivy), Harvard can clinch at least a share of the championship. Lose, and the Crimson will drop into a tie.
More is on the line than an unprecedented four-peat. Last season at Harvard Stadium, the Quakers shattered a 22-game win streak, an undefeated season, and Harvard hearts with a 35-25 upset.
Not even a Crimson victory over Yale—and therefore a banner split between Harvard, Penn, and Dartmouth—could erase the pain of that loss. Sometimes sorrow sticks.
“The senior class from last year was a great bunch of guys,” senior halfback Anthony Firkser said. “Having to lose to that [Penn] team ruined our perfect season. And seeing how those guys handled it was tough.”
Tonight, then, is the grittiest of grudge matches. It is the clash of titans that pundits envisioned when they picked the Crimson and the Quakers to finish one-two in preseason polls.
Harvard and Penn—these are the contestants. And history or hysteria—these are the stakes.
“It’s definitely our biggest game of the year up to this point,” senior safety Kolbi Brown said. “The emotions will be high on both ends.”
Heading into last week, the Quakers had not suffered a conference loss. After dropping decisions to Lehigh and Fordham, Penn had steamrolled through five straight wins.
But a 28-0 defeat to Princeton—which also has one Ivy loss—derailed any momentum. Now the Quakers enter this weekend with a dangerous combination: underdog desperation and top-notch talent.
Three players headline the Penn offense. Senior Alek Torgersen quarterbacks the team. No Ivy League player has thrown more interceptions (14) or fewer interceptions (three). A sophomore starter, Torgersen made the All-Ivy first team as a junior. Oh, and the 230-pound veteran averages over 40 rushing yards per game.
Torgersen’s favorite target is junior wide receiver Justin Watson, a third-team All-American in 2015. The Bridgeville, Pa. native is the only Ancient Eight player to log more than 110 receiving yards and eight catches per game. Last year he burned the Crimson for 249 all-purpose yards.
Running back Tre Solomon rounds out the attack. The junior tops the league with 89 rushing yards per game, part of an attack that averages over 175 yards on the ground.
Facing these potent weapons, Harvard will deploy a defense that ranks second in the conference in rushing defense but has given up at least 20 points in the last four games.
“Coaches drew up a great scheme for us, just like they do for every team,” Brown said. “We’re trying to go out and execute that scheme.”
The defensive line has played a steady role. Paced by sophomore defensive end D.J. Bailey, the Crimson leads the Ancient Eight with 22 sacks. But injuries have forced the linebacker core to depend on raw talent, and talented quarterbacks have sometimes picked apart the secondary.
Can Harvard clamp down on the Torgersen-Watson-Solomon triumvirate? If so, then the achievement would rank as the defensive feat of the year.
Penn’s defense has weaknesses of its own. The bad news started in week five, when senior linebacker and predicted tackle leader Donald Panciello went down with an injury.
Linebacker Colton Moskal (75 tackles) has played well in his teammate’s absence, but collectively the Quakers sit sixth in the Ivy League in yardage allowed. A toothless defensive line has combined for nine sacks—worse than all conference foes.
This week, Penn confronts a Harvard offense that has performed effectively, if not efficiently. After eight weeks, the Crimson has committed 18 turnovers; only Cornell has matched that total.
But the athleticism of senior quarterback Joe Viviano has compensated for any struggles. He averages 231 yards per game and has tossed 13 touchdowns.
Shelton-Mosley and Firkser have grabbed eight of these scores. The two targets both average over 75 yards a game. Recently sophomore Adam Scott has joined the mix: Last week he was named Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week after recording 109 receiving yards and two touchdowns.
Especially in 2016, however, these two football teams are more than the sums of their parts. More accurately, they are the sums of their histories—long narratives that include a combined 34 Ancient Eight titles.
Tonight Harvard has an opportunity to add one more.
“We know this is the biggest test of the year right now,” Firkser said. “Our team is definitely mentally prepared.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for junior guard Andre Chatfield.


2015-2016 Recap:
Chatfield's second season for the Crimson was a bit of a mixed bag. He played fewer minutes than his freshman season on a decidedly worse team and averaged just over a point per appearance, taking less than one shot a game. His offensive game didn't develop in the way many outside observers had hoped; almost all of Chatfield's shots came as wide-open three-pointers or fastbreak layups.
The good news for the junior came on the other end of the floor. The spindly 6'4" guard was routinely deployed on top opposing perimeter threats during the latter half of the season and looked significantly more comfortable within the flow of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker's defense. Chatfield's lateral quickness and active hands make him a handful defensively and he offered a superior defensive presence to then-freshmen starters Corey Johnson and Tommy McCarthy.
Important Next Steps:
Heading into his junior season, Chatfield has a couple of main areas of improvement:
1. Defensive Discipline — With quick hands comes great responsibility. During the second half of the season, Chatfield would at times rack up a series of quick fouls on perimeter reach-ins. On back-to-back weekends in mid-February he twice picked up three or more fouls in less than 20 minutes and for the season he averaged 4.8 fouls per 40 minutes. To stay on the floor, Chatfield has to be more disciplined on the perimeter.
2. Crashing the Glass — Harvard's last two defensive aces, Wesley Saunders '15 and senior Agunwa Okolie, both provided excellent defensive rebounding in addition to outstanding perimeter defense. Chatfield, who averaged a paltry five rebounds per 40 minutes in 2015-2016, should attempt to emulate Okolie—who had more rebounds his senior year than his first three years combined.
3.Developing the In-Between Game —  Chatfield, who has made just six triples in two seasons, is unlikely to develop into the three-and-D prototypical wing he was projected as coming out of high school. Given the amount of shooters on Harvard's roster, this isn't a big deal. What the roster current lacks is people who can beat their opponents off the dribble, a skill that Okolie significantly improved on in his later years. Chatfield should work to cultivate the same skill set, which would differentiate him more from the competition.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Chatfield comes into 2016-2017 as a rare and favorable archetype: the veteran in a position of need. His play and development this past season left something to be desired, but it matters little because Harvard has so few options to replace Okolie and departed senior Patrick Steeves at the three. Amaker's aversion to playing smaller wings at the three in small-ball lineups means that Johnson likely won't see much time at the three, leaving Chatfield and freshman Seth Towns as the only traditional wings on the roster.
Towns will come to Cambridge a more polished offensive talent than Chatfield, however, so the veteran will need to demonstrate in offseason workouts that the offense-defense tradeoff works in his favor. He is fortunate that Amaker has historically preferred defense-first players in this position; just two years ago, he routinely cramped his offensive spacing by playing Okolie over junior Corbin Miller for defensive reasons.
In fact, Okolie is the model for Chatfield to emulate. The senior had a relatively anonymous first two years on campus before sliding in for Laurent Rivard '14 as a starter his junior year and breaking out as the team's most valuable player as a senior. Chatfield's task is a bit more challenging—Okolie never had anyone as good as Towns pushing him for playing time—but the need for him to step up is just as important.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for junior power forward Chris Egi.


2015-2016 Recap:
In his second year in Cambridge, Egi continued to progress. After getting spot minutes as a freshman, the big man became the primary backup to then-junior center Zena Edosomwan. With Edosomwan struggling with injuries and foul trouble for large portions of the Ivy League schedule, Egi played heavy minutes during conference play, registering 15 or more minutes in five of eight contests before being shut down during the season's final weekend.
When Egi got playing time, he showed progress on both ends of the floor from his freshman season. He shot just 45 percent from the floor but routinely generated good opportunities at the rim with his athleticism and ability to move around slower defenders. He was especially effective in transition, running the floor hard and punished lazier opponents. On defense, he showed himself to be an effective shot blocker in the paint with a quick second jump.
Despite this progress, opponents quickly figured out how to limit the big man. Egi shot a putrid eight of 29 at the free throw line and he was often fouled hard around the rim as opponents dared him to make up the points at the charity stripe, a strategy that was rewarded much more often than not. On defense, while he came up with some sensational blocks coming in from the weak side, he struggled as an on-ball defender and averaged more than seven fouls per 40 minutes.
Important Next Steps:
To continue progressing and become a starter in his third year in Cambridge, Egi will have to take a couple big steps forward:
1.Shoot, Shoot, Shoot — Egi's free throwing shooting, quite simply, needs to be twice as good as it was last year if he wants to be able to play alongside Edosomwan, a sub-60 percent free throw shooter a year ago. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker played these lineups sparingly last year because they were an awkward fit offensively and defensively, and improved free throw shooting would be key in persuading him to play them more often.
2.Develop Footwork — A lot of the junior’s foul trouble last year came from getting caught out of position or being too jumpy defensively. Although he can improve on staying down and not falling for every pump fake, Egi can help put himself in more favorable positions by moving his feet better and walling off the paint from opponents. On the other end, cleaner post footwork will get him easier looks and allow him to use his 6'9" frame to wall off the paint.
2016-2017 Outlook:
If last season is any indication, Amaker will give Egi every chance to earn the starting power forward job alongside Edosomwan. Egi is the only veteran big man on the roster that has received serious playing time in the past and Amaker is very reticent to hand over the keys to his defense to someone who isn't innately familiar with it. Given Harvard's struggles with perimeter defense last year—something that will get better with the return of Chambers but looks to still be a problem—having smart interior defenders will be crucial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for junior forward Zach Yoshor.


2015-2016 Recap:
Yoshor did not have a breakout sophomore campaign, averaging less than a minute a game despite no major injuries throughout the year. He took only two shots all year, making one against Yale after the contest was already decided.
Watching Yoshor’s spot-up duty in Cambridge, it is easy to understand both his strengths and his faults. The 6’6” junior operates at a major quickness deficit and struggles to both generate open looks on offense and move with his defender. In high school, he could shoot over any defender and use his length to compensate on defense. At the next level, he is awkwardly in between: not fast enough to keep up with opposing shooting guards and not big enough to bang with opposing forwards.
On the plus side, Yoshor has flashed a pure stroke when he’s had the chance to play and he is one of the more natural shooters on the team. He moves deliberately on offense and gets to his spots well, but once again lacks the strength to finish well around the basket.
Important Next Steps:
Yoshor (see below) will struggle to get major minutes this year, but he can significantly improve his chances at playing time with two major steps:
1.Gaining Strength — As reference above, Yoshor lacks the lower body strength to hang with opposing bigs. Yet, that is his best option on defense; getting stronger is easier than getting faster, and Yoshor could punish bigger defenders on the other end with his slippery game if he could keep up defensively.
2.Expanding The Range — Harvard coach Tommy Amaker is typically reluctant to play minus defenders at any position. The one caveat has always been when his team needs shooting. Sophomore Corey Johnson and senior Corbin Miller ’15-’17 both scored significant playing time as defensively challenged rookies by shooting the lights out; to follow in their footsteps, Yoshor simply has to become an elite shooter, quick.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Bluntly, Yoshor has not had a notable first two years in Cambridge, registering a combined 36 minutes and 10 shots in mop-up duty across the two campaigns. With an influx of talent unlike any the Ivy League has ever seen before, he faces a steep uphill climb to playing time.
That is not to say that his task is impossible, however. The junior, as can be seen in his high school highlight reels, is an ace shooter on a team that lacks floor spacers at the forward position. In truth, Yoshor’s path to the floor is as some kind of hybrid three that can light it up from deep while holding his own on the defensive end. That is no easier than it sounds, however, and do not be surprised if the he doesn’t see a substantial playing time increase next season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for senior point guard Corbin Miller.


2015-2016 Recap:
Miller took a couple of small steps forward in 2015-2016, shifting into more of a point guard role for the Crimson. As a sophomore, Miller played more two than one next to Chambers and Wesley Saunders '15, ball-dominant guards that were both more effective at creating offense off the dribble. As the team's second-best shooter his sophomore campaign, Miller was relied upon to space the floor more than anything else.
With Saunders graduating and Chambers sitting out the year with an injury, the team's guard situation looked very different the following year. Miller was the oldest point guard on the roster and became the team's secondary option at the point. He became more of a playmaker, dishing out more than twice as many assists as the previous season, and an effective floor-spacer, shooting 37 percent on nearly five attempts a game and showing a more effective off-the-dribble jumper than a year before.
Miller's role waned as the year went on and starter Tommy McCarthy improved, however. His best game of the season came in December, when he poured in 17 points on eight shots to help Harvard defeat BYU. He had nine or more points in six of his next eight outings, culminating in a 10-point performance in a road loss in Hanover. In the 12 Ivy League games that followed, he'd hit or clear that mark just twice while shooting just 22 percent from deep after shooting 44 percent to that point.
Important Next Steps:
Entering his senior season in Cambridge, Miller's should attempt to become a better version of himself, not a new player:
1.Quicken The Release — Harvard coach Tommy Amaker often runs Miller around screens but the offense doesn't run the quick catch-and-shoot actions for the senior that are so common in the NBA. While Miller has a quick release, making it even faster would make those actions a more viable offensive threat.
2.Improve Passing In Space — Miller's relative lack of size and athleticism will make it hard for him to be an effective finisher around the rim, but he can compensate by improving as a passer on the interior. When asked to be a lead guard last year, he showed flashes of playmaking ability; developing that further would allow him to punish defenders that go over picks instead of running through them.
2016-2017 Outlook:
As a captain, Miller is likely in line for some serious playing time. He improved as a perimeter defender last year, which makes him a better fit alongside Chambers—the presumptive starter at the point. Seeing him as a starter is difficult, however, since the team needs to make minutes for sophomore Corey Johnson, a better shooter than Miller who has a lengthier frame and a more varied offensive game.
Still, Miller is steady at the point and Amaker puts a high priority on seniors. The best bet is that Miller will come off the bench to replace Chambers and may even work with him in two point guard lineups when the opponent does not have large guards that can punish him inside. Of all the players on the lineup, Miller may be able to get up the best shot when the shot clock is running down—an invaluable commodity on the second unit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for senior point guard Matt Fraschilla.


2015-2016 Recap:
When Chambers went down with an ACL injury before the season started, Fraschilla was the main expected beneficiary. The only other non-freshman point guard on the roster, then-junior Corbin Miller, had not shown enough the year before to be the clear-cut starter and was better playing off the ball. Fraschilla thus appeared to be in line for, if not a starting job, significant minutes in his junior season in Cambridge. The start was rosy: Fraschilla earned a Her Campus profile in September and played well in early-season scrimmages.
Things went downhill quickly, however. Tommy McCarthy secured the starting job and in the second game of the season, Fraschilla tore his ACL against Providence. His season was over after 17 minutes and Miller quickly became the primary backup for the remainder of the season. A great opportunity vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
Important Next Steps:
In his 77 career minutes, Fraschilla has shown a rather conventional game. He doesn't have much confidence in his jump shot—having not taken a three since his freshman year—and aims to beat his opponents off the dribble. He is a deft passer when he gets in the lane, but lacks the length (he is just 5'11") to finish effectively over bigger defenders. As he focuses on next season, his goals should be twofold:
1.Embrace Finishing Through Contact — For smaller guards, a key to finishing effectively around the rim is to use the length of big men against them, driving into the body and preventing them from leaning in to block the shot. Since becoming an ace shooter over a summer is unrealistic, Fraschilla should focus on further developing his strengths.
2.Master the Pick-and-Roll — Harvard ran relatively few pick-and-rolls in 2015-2016, but could maximize the athleticism and finishing ability of senior Zena Edosomwan by finding him an effective pick-and-roll point guard. While Chambers is likely to become that player, Fraschilla can provide significant value to the team by mastering the same skill set.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Fraschilla's future with the team is, to put it generously, uncertain. His main comparative advantage last season was his veteran leadership, as his on-court skills pale in contrast to his competition at the position. With the team's two captains both competing for time at the point, Fraschilla can no longer claim that advantage.
Furthermore, the arrival of Bryce Aiken and (to a lesser extent) Christian Juzang will squeeze what few available minutes exist at the one. In his last season in Cambridge, Chambers played nearly 35 minutes a contest at the position—roughly in line with what he played his first two season. That number will likely go down in 2016-2017 since Amaker has considerably more options at the position, but Chambers will still likely play 30-32 minutes a game. The remaining eight minutes are more likely to go to a combination of McCarthy, Miller, and Aiken than Fraschilla.
Fraschilla's problem is compounded by his inability to shoot the ball effectively. All three of the above guards, who offer value as off-ball cutters and shooters, could conceivably play alongside Chambers in two point-guard lineups. Fraschilla is most effective with the ball in his hands and can't claim the same versatility, which ultimately means that is unlikely that he sees any kind of serious minutes in his final Harvard season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for senior point guard Siyani Chambers.
2015-2016 Recap:
Coming into the 2015-2016 season, Chambers—a three-year starter at the game's most important position—was expected to be the senior leader on a team that had just lost four rotation players (including its best player, Wesley Saunders '15) to graduation. Although the team had just three of its top seven players from a year ago, the conventional thinking went that the presence of Chambers—a consummate winner at every level of his career—gave it a chance to get its sixth straight league title.
The fantasy evaporated as quickly as it started. Chambers suffered an ACL injury during an offseason workout and was forced to drop out to maintain his eligibility for the following season, leaving the team in disarray. Harvard finished 14-16 and needed wins in four of its final five conference games just to get to .500 in Ivy League play. With Chambers often watching from the stands, the Crimson was blown out multiple times at home—something that did not happen once during his first three years on the team.
His presence loomed large all year and the team's decision to elect him co-captain for the upcoming year represented his influence and gravitas among a locker room he never inhabited. His return is symbolic of the team's hopes of returning to its old ways and he is expected to be as big a part as any in the revival.
Important Next Steps:
Going into his senior year, there were a couple important areas of Chambers' game that he needed to improve on. Two main objectives stand out:
1. Improve Decision-making — Before Chambers' junior season, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker noted how much he wanted his point guard to become more efficient. Chambers failed miserably at this goal, shooting just 36 percent from the field and 34 percent from three—both career lows. He can reverse the direction of the trend by trimming the fat from his game (namely the pull-up elbow jumper in transition) and moving more without the ball to spot up behind the line.
2. Finish Better Around The Rim — Dating back to his freshman season, Chambers has frequently struggled to finish possessions at the cup. Generously listed at 6'0", he fails to use his body to create separation with defenders, leading to layups that clang off the rim. Fixing these issues will round out his offensive game and lead to a nice jump in efficiency.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Barring another injury, Chambers will be the team's starting point guard when they return to campus. As an unquestioned leader of the team and an Amaker favorite, he will be given every chance to bond with senior All-Ivy center Zena Edosomwan and excel in the offense. As a leading ball handler, he can maximize Edosomwan's athletic ability by making the duo a fearsome pick-and-roll tandem, a staple play around which Amaker can build a successful offense.
On the other end, Chambers' defensive ability will be a big part of Harvard's success in Ivy League play. Although he is undersized, Chambers has improved significantly as a defender during his time in Cambridge and steps in as unquestionably the best defensive point guard in the league. In his last official game, he harassed UNC guard Marcus Paige all contest, something Amaker will call on him to replicate against the premier Ivy guards such as  Princeton's Devin Cannady.
In fact, Harvard's ability to go back to the top of the league will be in large part dependent on Chambers' ability to win those matchups. Cannady might be the best player on the preseason favorite—if Chambers can defang him, Harvard will have no problem shutting down its main rival's offense. By contrast, if he gets the better of Chambers, the Crimson will struggle to keep up, making Chambers—once again—Harvard's most important player.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for All-Ivy senior center Zena Edosomwan.
2015-2016 Recap:
After Chambers tore his ACL early in the year, the big question for the Crimson was who the offense was going to come from. The team had lost almost all its offense from a year earlier and none of its seniors—Agunwa Okolie, Patrick Steeves, and Evan Cummins—had ever been a featured offensive piece before. Enter Edosomwan. The then-junior spent the entire summer working on his game with four separate coaches and came out as the obvious focal point of the offense.
With great responsibility came great production. Edosomwan rewarded Harvard coach Tommy Amaker for his faith by finishing a couple of rebounds short of a double-double average on the year, throwing in 13.1 points and 9.9 rebounds a game on 50 percent shooting from the field. The obscene became the new normal; after he posted back-to-back 15-rebound games in the season's first week, Edosomwan had double-doubles the next month against two top-five opponents, including a monster 25-point, 16-rebound performance against No. 3 Oklahoma.
As the year went on, Edosomwan cooled down. His putrid free throw shooting (49 percent on the year) became a liability that Ivy League teams mercilessly exploited, hacking him early and often to stop the Crimson offense in its tracks. He was dominant one weekend and absent the next, occasionally pressing too much on the court and showing his frustration by picking up early fouls. He found a healthy balance as the year ended, however, and while he never reached the peaks of the nonconference schedule, he was rewarded with an All-Ivy slot for the first time, making the league's second team.
Important Next Steps:
Edosomwan had arguably the best summer of any Crimson player a year ago, setting the precedent for another large step forward. He has a couple major areas to focus on to take the next step, however:
1.Free Throw Shooting — It's as obvious as it is simple: Edosomwan needs be a far better free throw shooter next year. The senior was taken out of games late out of fear that opponents might foul him, something that he can easily avoid next year by simply hitting 60 percent from the line. The math on intentional fouls looks a lot worse when the expected value of a trip to the line is 1.2 points instead of 1.0 so Edosomwan doesn't have to overhaul his stroke, just improve it.
2.Verticality — Although Agunwa Okolie ‘16 took home the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, most advanced statistics saw Edosomwan as the Crimson's most valuable defensive player. Most of this value came from Edosomwan's prodigious rebounding rate, but he can round out his game by becoming a more effective shot blocker on that end.
3.Finishing in the Pick-and-Roll — Amaker ran relatively few pick-and-rolls a year ago, adapting his offense to the skill set of his point guard. With the return of Chambers, however, the pick-and-roll will likely become an offensive staple again. When Chambers and Edosomwan ran it a year ago, the then-sophomore fumbled away pass after pass in traffic. With a summer of focus, that should be an easy area to clean up.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Along with Chambers and sophomore Corey Johnson, you can safely pencil Edosomwan into the starting lineup. While the team has significantly more offensive weapons than a season ago—making it less likely that he get as many post touches as a year ago—he will be the primary post threat in an offense designed around back-to-the-basket play. As a consequence, expect him to be a very active and involved offensive threat.
The introduction of Chambers, as mentioned above, may indicate a shift in his role, however. Edosomwan didn't set many screens last year, something that will change with Chambers running the paint. The senior is arguably the team's most athletic big man and can be a fearsome finisher when given a running start, a position Amaker will attempt to place him in as much as possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While ‘all’ eyes won’t be on the Harvard men’s hockey team until Saturday, the Crimson still has two important points to play for tonight in New Jersey. On the eve of the ECAC championship rematch between Harvard and Quinnipiac, the Crimson is set to take on Princeton at Hobey Baker Memorial Arena tonight at 7 p.m. EST.
“Friday night is an incredibly important game in the Ivy League,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “In the standings, it’s the same two points as any other game in the season—certainly the same two points as Saturday night.”
TALE OF THE TAPE
Harvard (3-0-1, 1-0-1 ECAC) enters tonight’s contest unbeaten through its first four games. After dominating possession in the attacking zone but struggling to find the back of the net in a 1-1 tie with Colgate last Friday, the Crimson bounced back with a 4-3 victory over rival Cornell behind the first career hat trick for sophomore forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage. As a result of the three points at home, Harvard jumped from No. 12 to No. 10 in both the USCHO and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls.
Meanwhile, Princeton (0-3-0, 0-2-0) will be looking for its first win of the season in its home opener against the Crimson. In its first conference weekend of the year, the Tigers traveled nearly 400 miles to North Country, where they fell 4-0 to St. Lawrence on Friday and 4-2 to Clarkson the following night. Princeton’s slow start to the season on the surface is hardly surprising given that the Tigers were picked to finish last by both the coaches and the media of the ECAC. Yet in Princeton’s most recent matchup against the Golden Knights of Clarkson, the two teams were tied in the third period; additionally, the Tigers outshot both of their weekend opponents.
SCOUTING THE TIGERS
“I think Princeton has got a young team with good speed, good size,” Donato said. “They play very hard and are especially tough at home. I think it’s safe to say that all these Ivy League matchups bring a great amount of emotion and competitiveness to them, and I think that it’ll be a very hard fought, tight game.”
Thus far, Princeton’s exclusively sophomore top line has been responsible for practically all of the Tigers’ offensive production. Left wing Ryan Kuffner, who led the team with 20 points a year ago, has a goal and two assists; right wing Alex Riche scored Princeton’s only two goals in its season opener against Michigan State, then added an assist against Clarkson; and center Max Veronneau has logged three assists. Meanwhile, all the other forwards on the Tiger roster have combined for one point through three games.
Manning the Princeton net has been senior Colton Phinney. Largely because of a struggling blue line, Phinney led the ECAC in saves a season ago with 1058—a number that averages out to more than 35 a game. The last time Harvard played the Tigers at Hobey Baker Arena, Phinney eclipsed that average, stopping 39 of 40 shots against one of the top offenses in college hockey. But the Princeton offense left Phinney hanging. The Tigers were held scoreless, and once Phinney left his goal in favor of an extra skater, the Crimson added two empty-netters in what amounted to a 3-0 win for the visitors.
STATE OF THE CRIMSON
As for those visitors, they too received almost all of their offense from members of their first line last weekend. Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot picked up a goal and an assist over the two games, while sophomores Ryan Donato and Zerter-Gossage combined for seven points against Cornell alone.
Like Princeton, only one other forward got on the scoresheet over the weekend—senior Tyler Moy, who logged an assist in both games. Where the Crimson and Tigers differ, however, is in the fact that Harvard has seen what kind of potential its second line possesses. In the Crimson’s opening two games against Arizona State last month, Moy, Luke Esposito, and Sean Malone logged a total of 15 points. Granted, the level of competition is much higher in the ECAC, but that line likely will not remain quiet for long stretches of time.
Meanwhile on the defensive end, Ted Donato confirmed this week that sophomore D-man Adam Baughman has been a bit banged up. In the first game of the season, Baughman started alongside freshman Adam Fox on the Crimson’s second defensive pairing; but sophomore Jacob Olson has filled that spot in the three games since. Donato said he does not expect the injury, which remained undisclosed, to be long-term.
