After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Roughly 800 students and faculty members packed the Science Center Plaza on Friday for “Shabbat 1000,” a massive dinner co-organized by Harvard’s Hillel and Chabad organizations. Organizers said the event was the largest of its kind in Harvard history.
For the dinner celebrating the Jewish Sabbath, event organizers welcomed students of all backgrounds, and during the Sabbath ritual each table had a transliteration of Hebrew prayers that allowed participants to follow along.
“The idea is to invite students from every background and degree of observance to find their place at the table of Jewish life,” said Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, a co-founder and director of Harvard Chabad.
Elizabeth M. Rosenblatt ’17 and Alexandra S. Lobel ’16 co-chaired the event. Both said they were proud of the welcoming atmosphere since one of the goals of “Shabbat 1000” was to promote cultural understanding.
“In Jewish tradition it’s a huge ‘mitzvah,’ or good deed, to invite another Jew to share Shabbat with you,” Rosenblatt said. “By reaching out to the entire Harvard community and not just Jewish students, we have done an even larger ‘mitzvah’ by fostering cultural awareness and inclusivity.”
Eventgoers noted the diversity of the crowd. “I was impressed by how many people who aren’t Jewish came. It was a meaningful experience for everyone involved,” Adrienne M. Propp ’17 said.
Orlea L. Miller ’16, the vice president for Shabbat at Harvard Hillel, was one of the speakers at the event.
“While I didn’t grow up celebrating Shabbat regularly, I came to appreciate the welcoming and comforting community at Harvard each week I spent here,” Miller said in her speech.
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, the director of Harvard Hillel, praised the joint effort among students in Hillel and Chabad for bringing the event to fruition.
“We met last spring in the corner of this very tent and envisioned this. It really was the students who just took the ball and ran with it,” he said.
Steinberg added, “There is a Jewish proverb that says ‘In a great gathering of people, divine splendor is manifest.’ And that’s exactly what I saw tonight.”
Chabad and Hillel held the first “Shabbat 1000” dinner at Annenberg Hall in 2006 and organized another in the Malkin Athletic Center in 2008.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A rise in the number of Bok Center teaching certificates awarded to teaching fellows, teaching assistants, and course assistants has prompted administrators to discuss changing its criteria or creating a more comprehensive one, according to Robert A. Lue, faculty director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
In the last 15 years, recipients for the Certificate of Distinction for TFs, TAs, and CAs has increased dramatically, from 350 in the spring of 1999 to 513 in the spring of 2015. 
Currently, the Bok Center awards certificates to all who receive at least an overall rating of a 4.5 out of 5.0 on the Q scale with five or more responses. Lue said evaluating Q scores along with the input of the instructor and adviser may provide better criteria for recognition.
“I think it would be worthwhile to have more awards that are more holistic and that are multiperspective on the quality of teaching on that specific individual,” Lue said.
Lue added that the increase in awards may arise from the improved resources available to teaching fellows.
“So many departments have teaching practica where graduate students are taught how to teach, so of course they will be better teachers and of course they will do better,” Lue said.
Christopher M. B. Allison, who most recently received the award last spring, said the Bok Center has provided a series of teaching seminars over the course of the semester that have been integral to his instruction.
“[The seminars] that the Bok Center gives is a very valuable thing,” Allison said. “I think it has been really helpful. I have gotten a lot of skills out of it.”
Jason B. Silverstein, another recipient of the award, also noted the more hands-on approach to teaching that the Bok Center provided to him and improved his evaluations.
“Getting yourself videotaped teaching, being to be able to watch yourself, and being able to get critiqued with someone else has been an indispensable part of the process,” Silverstein said.
Still, not all award recipients agree that the increase is just a result of an increase in teaching resources.
“I think there is a babying culture around here, how everyone gets As and such. I think the same applies to us,” said Tarek Abu Hussein, another recipient of the award.
Lue maintained that an increase in the number of awards might not dilute the value of an individual one.
“It’s not just award inflation or some Q guide inflation. I would hate to see us create some arbitrary cut off just to arbitrarily reduce the numbers,” Lue said. “There is enormously important information in the Q. But they are incredibly valuable as one component of a variety of other measures or channels of understanding what happened.”
