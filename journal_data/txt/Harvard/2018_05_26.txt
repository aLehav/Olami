After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dressed in a white flowing shirt and satin lavender pants, Perfume Genius took the stage at Boston Calling looking like something out of a pastel vision. Before the Seattle-based, indie pop artist could catch his breath, the opening piano notes to “Otherside,” a dreamy track from his most recent album “No Shape,” flooded the stage. The start of his otherworldly crooning called the buzzing, afternoon crowd to attention, entranced by what promised to be an ethereal experience.
When he introduced himself, the softness of his simple “Hi” came as a surprise after the strong vocals of his opening number, so unexpected as to prompt cheers of encouragement in response, perhaps assuming he felt nervous. As his soft speaking voice might lead one to believe, Perfume Genius is not prone to much banter, but each word he chose to offer in his delicate whisper felt precious. “I feel like I need to utilize that space,” he said, gesturing shyly to the center divide in the crowd. When he finally made his way down the steps of the stage and into the space he previously pointed out as “un-utilized” the energy exploded, his off-hand remark fresh and important in everyone’s minds.
“Let’s just keep going with the music,” he said at one point, just as he was about to pause. Perfume Genius is not one for filling silence with chatter unnecessarily—he’d much rather fill it with music. His softness, it becomes clear as the performance goes on, is not a symptom of nervousness, but rather a quality that radiates from the artist even at his most upbeat level. He hit his stride a few songs in, during the chorus of “Wreath,” another tune from “No Shape.” Singing the words, “I see the sun go down / I see the sun come up,” the swaying audience finally matched his unique energy.
Watching Perfume Genius perform is a visual spectacle just as much as it is a musical one. In his hands, the microphone is less of a tool and more of a natural extension of his limbs. He twisted the cord between his fingers and laid it across his body like a snake. Perfume Genius does not walk around the stage so much as he wanders. He is constantly dancing and yet appears somehow unchoreographed, shifting and gliding through space while twisting his back and arms as though he is moving through water as he sings. His shirt came untucked during his second or third number and just when it seemed like he would ignore this small, unplanned change in appearance, the song ended and he diligently tucked it back in—a brief moment showing the close attention Perfume Genius pays to each and every detail of his performance despite how effortless it may appear.
In more synth-heavy pieces, his vocals take a backseat to the instrumentals, but this should not be mistaken for lack of talent because for every moment Perfume Genius lets the music take over there are ten more in which his voice rings loud and clear over every sound beneath it. If you listen closely beyond the vocals, dancing, and the synths, the lyrics to his songs are beautiful, and at times even haunting. “How long must we live right / Before we don’t even have to try,” he sings on “Valley.” In the moment it feels like the question is not rhetorical, but rather very real. He is asking for the answer.
Perfume Genius is something of a dream-pop David Bowie in the flesh. This became most apparent at the end of his set, where he shifted from the soft pop of his album “No Shape” to the indie-rock style tracks from previous albums “Too Bright” and “Put Your Back N 2 It.” He ventured into new territory with haunting tracks like “My Body,” showing a completely different side of his vocals than had previously been on display. As captivating as his dancing is, Perfume Genius’s greatest asset is his voice. Whether it be in quiet musings or booming vocal riffs, his voice reaches out from the stage, between each person in the audience, to fill the space before it.

As frontman and vocalist Brandon Flowers repeated throughout their set, The Killers came to Boston Calling “by way of glamorous Las Vegas, Nevada,” and much of the glitz and showmanship that makes that city special came with them. Before they even entered, the stage was set with a prominent, light-studded Mars glyph (the symbol for male) in front of Flowers’ microphone, with three smaller Venus counterparts for his backup singers. As if the props weren’t daring enough, the band came onstage, said a few, brief words, then immediately launched into “Mr. Brightside.”
For those unfamiliar with The Killers or “Mr. Brightside,” the song is undoubtedly their biggest hit. It has nearly 500 million plays on Spotify, almost two and half times more than their next most popular song, “Somebody Told Me.” More than that, despite being one of The Killers’ first songs, and debuting in 2004, it is still widely played 14 years later, and is a surefire crowd pleaser. In other words, for them to open with it is an incredibly bold move.
Bold, but effective: It is possible, had they not led with it, many in the audience would have been distracted, wondering when this beloved track would play. By getting it out of the way at the top of the show, The Killers gave themselves breathing room to convince the audience, some of whom may not have listened to them since the mid-2000s, just how many genuine hits the band managed to create. Doubling down, they played “Somebody Told Me” only two songs later. Those concerned by the rate at which they were burning through their hits in an hour-and-a-half-long set needn’t have been worried—The Killers put on a show that reminded the crowd why they listened to the band, and gave them even more reasons to do so.
With a backdrop of stunning visuals often evoking pyramids, the Nevada desert, and the glitz and glam of Vegas, Flowers and his bandmates embodied showmanship at its finest. At one point, Flowers quoted Evel Knievel, saying “people pay their hard-earned money to see the attempt, not the perfect landing.” He even did the necessary pandering to the home crowd, pointing out that, at the time, both the Red Sox and the Celtics were winning their respective games.
However, Flowers truly won the crowd over when he stopped the show to look at the signs a few audience members were holding up. One of these read, “I can drum ‘For Reasons Unknown.’” Taking the young man holding it at his word, Flowers invited him onstage, where true to his word, Nick from Boston (as he was introduced by Flowers) played the song near-perfectly. At the sight of this (at least apparently) random young man playing in front of thousands of people with his heroes, the screams of crowd reached a new height.
Riding the wave of this magnanimous gesture, The Killers kept energy high by playing their catchily nonsensical hit “Human,” and followed that with “The Man,” one of the better songs off of “Wonderful Wonderful,” their latest album. This self-aggrandizing tune was accompanied by images of a kitschy neon cowboy, a striking visual that helped propel the band through the newer track. Next came “Read My Mind,” another perennial favorite. Then Flowers interrupted himself again to ask the audience for permission to play a cover of Tom Petty’s “American Girl,” which he smoothly transitioned into “Free Fallin.’” Petty’s Americana rock felt right at home in the hands of The Killers, their energy perfectly capable of keeping up with the unbridled spirit of the songs.
After a few more songs, the set was over. The Killers closed with “All These Things That I’ve Done,” a anthemic track notable mostly for the legendary refrain, “I got soul, but I’m not a soldier.” Thanking the audience profusely, the band left the stage only to return a few minutes later. For the encore, Flowers ditched his sequined black suit for a full-body, glistening silver outfit very reminiscent of Elvis’ duds—another reference to their Vegas roots, and another callback to the past.
For their encore, The Killers played “The Calling,” then moved right into “When You Were Young,” a quasi-nostalgic song that has, in the 12 years since its release, become a piece of nostalgia for a generation that made up the bulk of the audience (perhaps, as it did for this reporter, conjuring up memories of playing the video game “Rock Band” in their basements and imaging themselves as superstars).
Bands like The Killers, who hit their peaks years ago, face a conundrum when it comes to performing. Do you focus on newer material that feels more relevant to you, despite it not being your most popular work? Or do you allow yourself to slip backwards in time, to the height of your fame, while taking the audience with you? At Boston Calling, The Killers walked that line perfectly. Song after song, they showed the audience how they became famous, and how they’ve retained their fame. With their showmanship, they were able to make their older songs fresh and vibrantly their own, while infusing newer songs with the energy needed to win over an audience perhaps unfamiliar with them. It would be hard not to walk out of that show without a newfound appreciation for The Killers, and what they’re trying to do.

On the first day of Boston Calling, Chicago rapper Noname made it halfway through a song into her Friday afternoon set on the Green Stage before she stopped the band, turned to the audience, and said “I’m going to be completely transparent, I am a little bit drunk.” She added, “This may not go how y’all thought it would,” before jumping into the infectious “Diddy Bop” from her 2016 mixtape “Telefone.” She played off the crowd, asking for ad libs and orchestrating sing-alongs. A few-missed lines aside, Noname performed songs like “Reality Check” and “Casket Pretty” with so much joy, talent, and ease it was hard to tell she was tipsy. “Pretend like you love me, pretend like you love yourself,” she said, giggling and asking the audience to dance with her. “I’m gonna try and maneuver two more songs then take a motherfuckin’ nap in the back,” she said towards the end or her set—but not before an impressive performance of the song “Shadow Man.” When all was said and done, Noname ended her set over ten minutes early, but you’d be hard pressed to find an audience member who didn’t love every moment of it.
Later, decked out in a royal blue jumpsuit-cape combo complete with eyes, suns, and flowers, singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers took to the Red Stage to share songs from her 2017 EP “Now That the Light is Fading,” as well as an array of newer songs. The crowd gelled instantly with her soulful voice which, especially when hitting high notes, begs comparison to that of Florence Welch. Despite trying to keep the cool her smooth, subtle songs demand, she couldn’t help but keep breaking into small smiles. “Is anyone out there in love? Does anyone out there think they’re falling in love?” she asked before diving into a song about how in love she is today. Rogers radiated joy, sprinting through the center divide to touch hands and sing with the crowd, lamenting on how she’s only been performing for a year now. It’s hard, once you’ve heard her sing, to imagine she hasn’t been popular longer. By the time she dove into “Alaska,” her breakout hit, the audience was already enchanted.
Just minutes after Rogers wrapped up, Portugal. The Man took to the nearby Green Stage–or I should say played a video introduction at the Green Stage in which cartoon characters Beavis and Butt-Head poked fun at the band before ultimately deciding they are “gods,” better than The Beatles, better than The Rolling Stones, and almost as good as Pantera. Afterward, the band covered part of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” as an introduction to their own song “Purple Yellow Red & Blue.” The backdrop for the entire performance was a series of trippy, multicolored animations—a perfect fit for the lyrics “Live in ecstasy, I know what’s best for me.” Additionally, the band got laughs from a series of slogans they claimed were “written by our management” projected over the animations: “Fuck rock critics, you can kiss my whole asshole,” “We are Portugal. The Man! Just making sure you’re at the right concert,” and a questionably placed Malcolm X quote that read, “If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” The set ended on a high note, complete with the slogan-recommendation “Let’s get weird,” as the entire audience jammed out to the band’s Grammy award-winning song “Feel it Still.”
Paramore wrapped up the opening day of Boston Calling at the Delta Blue Arena, one of the last shows before the headliner The Killers. The packed performance was well-attended and full of energy and nostalgia. In all-white clothing and electric blue and orange eye makeup, lead singer Hayley Williams said “This song goes out to Paramore” before practically catapulting into “Still Into You,” the entire crowd screaming along with her. Williams had an easy back and forth with her fans, even giving a shout out to newcomers. “If it’s your first time seeing a Paramore show, thank you,” she said. It didn’t matter if each person in the crowd was the biggest Paramore fan on earth or if they only knew one song, Paramore made the show something everyone could enjoy. The band balanced upbeat numbers with slower tracks like “Hate To See Your Heart Break,” during which the monitors projecting the band’s image went black and white to match the mood of the song. Williams spoke to the audience toward the end of her set about life, music, and fate. “Try to be present, it’s hard to be present,” she said. In that moment, all eyes in the crowd were on her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Longtime listeners of The National may wonder how well their often slow, melancholy songs translate to the concert stage. The answer is quite well, but some quality is, if not lost, changed in the process. When listening on one’s own, in a quiet setting, their songs feel like conversations covering everything from love to grief. In a venue like Boston Calling’s Red Stage, however, their music becomes a celebration of commiseration. With a crowd at hand, what once were quiet, somber songs turn into anthems.
Matt Berninger, the vocalist, let his audience know right away what they were in for, opening with “Nobody Else Will Be There.” This reflection on a troubled relationship is the first track on “Sleep Well Beast,” The National’s most recent album, released in 2017. They followed this opener with three more songs off of the album, namely “The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness,” “Walk it Back,” and “Guilty Party.” Although “Sleep Well Beast” is an excellent album, The National has nearly 20 years of music to pick from, and soon enough they moved on to some of their classics from “Trouble Will Find Me,” “High Violet,” and “Boxer.”
Once The National began playing crowd favorites like “Bloodbuzz Ohio,” “Fake Empire,” and “Mistaken for Strangers,” it became clear how different The National is live from how they are in the studio. One of the best examples of this was “Afraid of Everyone”—on “High Violet,” the song is exceedingly low-key. Ethereal backup vocals and a light rhythmic guitar comprise the majority of the song, overlaid with Berninger’s quietly soulful singing. Laid–back drums kick in about a minute in, along with the occasional burst of guitar. Not until the outro do the instruments come into play in a major way. Live, however, the song became anthemic. Berninger, along with much of the crowd, nearly screamed the refrain, “I don’t have the drugs to sort / I don’t have the drugs to sort it out,” and the already rocking outro turned into an opportunity for every band member to play their hearts out.
Likely due to the band’s long lifespan, the audience for The National seemed older and certainly more mature than those for Portugal. The Man and The Killers, who played before and after them. Certainly, The National’s complex and poetic lyrics demand more from their audience than the poppier rock of most acts at Boston Calling. One standout lyric from “Mistaken for Strangers” goes “Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts / So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves.” Similarly, their moodier style lends itself less to dancing and more to yelling out one’s sadness and pain.
But The National is no one trick pony—indeed, the highlight of the show was “I Need My Girl,” a simple and earnest love song about Berninger missing his wife while on tour. Maggie Rogers, a singer-songwriter who had played the same stage earlier in the day (read a short review of her performance here), joined him on vocals. Her higher, drawn out notes provided a wonderful contrast with Berninger’s clipped, almost conversational baritone, emphasizing the yearning that is the emotional backbone of the lyrics.
Bringing Rogers onstage was only the largest example of the band’s desire to give the audience a good show. Although light on banter, Berninger did talk briefly about his history with Boston. At least once, he threw his cup into the crowd, only half-empty (a stunt this reporter saw him pull at Bonnaroo in 2013). Another highlight was Aaron and Bryce Dessner, the twin brother guitarists, faced off in a joint guitar solo. Behind all of this, a massive screen displayed animation, often reminiscent of VHS distortion and other retro effects, overlaid with a heavily stylized live video feed of the band. Whereas most bands had purely animation or a still image as a backdrop, with live feed on screens to each side, The National’s mixture of the two perhaps mirrored the self–reflective nature of their music.
The National proved that their particular brand of contemplative tunes could very well be adapted for a live performance by bringing out the rock roots of their music. All too quickly, however, the concert was over, but Berninger made sure he and his band left on the same note they entered on by closing with “Terrible Love,” one of their best tracks. And yes, the song is as grim as its title suggests. In the summer heat, amidst so much celebration, The National gave its audience space for contemplation and commiseration as the day slipped into night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The pending lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions process will go to trial Oct. 15, according to a May 23 court filing.
In the filing, Allison D. Burroughs, the U.S. District Court judge who will hear the case in Boston, outlined a specific timeline for pre-trial proceedings as well as for the trial phase itself.
Burroughs set dates throughout September for designated meetings between the lawyers for the plaintiffs—members of the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions—and lawyers for Harvard. During these meetings, the lawyers will determine which experts and witnesses will provide testimony at the trial. The two parties will also confer in September regarding what information and documents they will present as evidence in the trial.
The trial will commence with “optional” opening statements and presentation of evidence Oct. 15 and proceedings will “generally” occur from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. over the course of several weeks at the United States District Court in Boston. A jury will not be present for the trial.
In a previous hearing in April, Burroughs said three weeks would likely form an appropriate duration for the trial.
The scheduling orders mark the latest development in an ongoing lawsuit filed against Harvard by Students for Fair Admissions in Nov. 2014.
The outcome of the lawsuit may have far-reaching consequences for the status of race-conscious admissions policies at private universities throughout the country.
While Students for Fair Admissions alleges the College’s admissions process is discriminatory and illegal, the College has repeatedly maintained it “does not discriminate against applicants from any group in its admissions processes.”
The order comes roughly six weeks after an April 10 hearing in which Burroughs ruled a small portion of more than 90,000 pages of files related to the College’s admissions process and individual student applicants will become public. Lawyers for the two parties must confer to produce redacted sets of certain documents over coming months, and more information could become public as the lawsuit goes to trial.
Burroughs previously set a June 15 deadline for the parties to submit filings regarding a dispositive motion—a motion to dismiss portions of the case without proceeding to trial. Though lawyers for Students for Fair Admissions have previously stated the plaintiffs will request summary judgement, they also noted the “diametrically opposed” arguments of the parties make resolution at this stage unlikely.
Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that the group “looks forward to filing our dispositive motion next month as well as the trial in October.”
Another May 23 order outlines the summer filing deadlines: amicus briefs in support of and in opposition to the dispositive motion must be filed by July 30 and August 30, respectively. The order also states the parties must meet before June 15 to discuss whether certain filings should remain sealed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No charges will be filed against the black Harvard undergraduate whose arrest April 13 sparked national controversy and allegations of police brutality, his attorneys announced Friday.
The student had initially faced charges including including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest. He incurred the charges the night of Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring concert, when CPD officers arrested and physically confronted him as he stood—naked and likely under the influence of narcotics—on a street median feet from campus.
The student's attorneys—Winthrop Faculty Dean and Harvard Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Law School professor Dehlia Umunna—wrote the student, his family, and his friends “applaud the decision” and that their client particularly wants to thank the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office and the Cambridge Police Department for their “efforts and considerations.” The two attorneys also wrote their client “looks forward to returning to his studies” and does not plan to discuss the arrest publicly.
Sullivan and Umunna wrote the District Attorney's office and the Cambridge police "worked tirelessly and cooperatively" to help all parties "reach a just and fair resolution."
CPD announced in a separate press release Friday that the City of Cambridge has hired Roderick L. Ireland, the first African-American appointed Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, to conduct an “independent review” of CPD’s “active and ongoing” internal review of the April 13 arrest. CPD's press release also stated no charges have been filed against the student, though it did not specify whether charges will be filed in future.
[Want to understand what happened the night of April 13? Review a comprehensive timeline of the events leading up to the arrest, the arrest itself, and Harvard’s response here.]
Per department policy, CPD conducts an internal investigation whenever officers use force—as they did when arresting the student.
The results of Ireland’s review will be made public, according to CPD’s press release.
“Our intention at the outset of this incident was to ensure a thorough, complete, fair and transparent internal review process,” CPD Commissioner Branville Bard Jr. said in the press release. “Having someone with a proven track record like Chief Justice Ireland reinforces those intentions and our commitment to a transparent process. We are thankful for his willingness to conduct an independent review.”
The student's attorneys wrote in their press release that their client and his family are pleased with Roderick’s selection.
“The choice of former Chief Justice Roderick Ireland to conduct an independent review of the police department’s internal affairs investigation was enthusiastically supported by all parties,” Sullivan and Umunna wrote.
The news the student will face no charges comes after weeks of controversy over his arrest, which roiled campus, earned condemnation from top Harvard administrators, and drew national headlines. The controversy largely centered on the way in which CPD officers physically interacted with the undergraduate.
After CPD officers arrived at the scene April 13, they spoke briefly with the student before one officer tackled him to the ground from behind. While the student remained on the ground, one law enforcement official delivered five punches to the student's stomach in an “ineffective” effort to handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
CPD officers later stated in the report that the student had clenched his fists and begun making aggressive moves towards law enforcement—thus prompting an officer to tackle him. But eyewitnesses of the event, including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, have stated CPD’s account of events is incorrect and that the officer tackled the student “without provocation.”
In a video of the incident later published by CPD, the student can be seen standing still, surrounded by four officers, while the officers talk to him for at least two minutes. The student then turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles him from behind.
Hours after the arrest, BLSA released a statement calling the incident an example of “police brutality.” In the following weeks, University affiliates met to process and protest the incident, and University President Drew G. Faust announced the formation of a committee to review the events leading up to the arrest. That review is ongoing.
In their press release Friday, the two lawyers wrote the student is grateful for the “outpouring of support” he received from Harvard affiliates, student groups, and from “complete strangers” both in Cambridge and around the country. The lawyers also asked for privacy on behalf of their client.
“Please respect his and his family’s privacy as they continue to process this incident and return to their regular lives," the lawyers wrote.
Editor’s Note: The Crimson is withholding the name of the student involved in the April 13 incident out of concern for his privacy.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton received the Radcliffe Medal—an honor that recognizes “an individual who has had a transformative impact on society”—in a ceremony Friday.
The Institute presented Clinton with the award on Radcliffe Day, a yearly celebration held during Harvard’s Commencement week. Past Radcliffe medalists include U.S. Supreme Court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor, tennis player Billie Jean King, writer Toni Morrison, and University President Drew G. Faust.
In remarks she delivered before awarding the medal to Clinton, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute Lizabeth Cohen praised Clinton’s “lifetime of exemplary service and profound impact.”
“She uses her fierce intellect and determination to create meaningful political and social change,” Cohen said.
In a keynote conversation she held with Mass. Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 earlier in the day, Clinton said she feels honored to be selected for the award.
“I really was absolutely thrilled because I have followed over the years what the Institute has done,” Clinton said. “A number of women whom I admire have been on this stage receiving this medal.”
The ceremony honoring Clinton came at the end of a series of conversations and speeches that lasted much of the day Friday. Earlier in the day, Kennedy School Professor Nicholas Burns moderated a panel entitled “Toward a New Global Architecture? America’s Role in a Changing World,” which featured Michèle A. Flournoy, David R. Ignatius, Meghan L. O’Sullivan, and Anne-Marie Slaughter. Former U.S. Secretary of State and Radcliffe Medal recipient Madeleine K. Albright delivered a tribute to Clinton after the panel.
Clinton told Healey she hopes people will continue to pursue careers in government in spite of what she characterized as a negative political environment under President Donald Trump’s administration. She said people in government will have to “pick up the pieces” after Trump’s time in office ends.
“I hope people who are so motivated will continue to go into government,” she said. “This too shall pass.”
In a speech she gave after accepting the medal, Clinton defended the importance of higher education at a time when some senators and representatives have expressed growing disillusionment with colleges and universities around the country.
“Higher education is one of the greatest accomplishments of the United States,” she said. “Stand up and defend the open inquiry, stand up and defend reason and facts.”
Clinton further urged the audience to embrace “radical empathy,” which she described as “reaching across the divides of race, class, and mostly politics” to “try to return to rational debate” and “disagree without being disagreeable.” She said this empathy is necessary to heal a country that she described as “dangerously polarized.”
“I know we don’t think of politics and empathy as going hand in hand these days, but they can and they must,” she said. “I say this not as a Democrat who lost an election but as an American who is concerned about losing a country.”
She said that “attempting to erase the line between fact and fiction, between truth and reality” should trouble all Americans and that Americans should attempt to build what she called “democratic resilience.” She urged Americans to support “brave journalism and reporting” and to vote “in every election, not just the presidential ones.”
“I am optimistic about the future because of how unbelievably tough we are proving to be,” she said.
