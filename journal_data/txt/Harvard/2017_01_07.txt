After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Labor Relations Board will begin a hearing Feb. 21 to address disagreement between Harvard union effort organizers and the University about which votes should be counted in the November election intended to decide whether eligible Harvard students form a union.
The hearing is the latest step in a complicated election process already prolonged by procedural delays and disputes about voter eligibility. Because an initial tally in December was too close to call, the NLRB must hold a hearing  that could determine if the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers becomes a union.
The Feb. 21 hearing will review the challenged ballots. It could also address objections both Harvard and union organizers have filed about the election if NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. decides to consider them, according to NLRB Deputy Regional Attorney Robert P. Redbord.
Union organizers argue in their objection that the University provided an inaccurate list of voters, potentially preventing eligible students from participating in the election. In a more limited complaint, the University contends that an NLRB official incorrectly disqualified a single ballot from being counted.
If Walsh decides to consider the union organizers’ objections and the NLRB rules in favor of them, the NLRB could call for a re-vote on whether or not eligible students at Harvard can unionize.
Currently, 314 challenged ballots remain uncounted from the Nov. 16 and 17 election because of questions about who was eligible to vote in the election. The Dec. 22 vote count showed that 1,272 eligible students voted in favor of unionization, while 1,456 opposed it—a 184 vote margin. Since the margin of counted ballots is currently smaller than the number of challenged ballots that have not yet been tallied, the NLRB will decide whether the remaining challenged ballots should be counted.
According to a pre-election agreement between union organizers and the University, graduate students employed as teaching and research assistants as well as undergraduate teaching staff were eligible to vote in the election. The agreement also stipulated that graduate students who were not currently employed, but had held research or teaching positions for one semester in the past academic year could vote under challenge, as long as they were not in their final year.
Both the University and the union filed their objections to the unionization election on Dec. 29, seven days after the initial vote count. In its objection, Harvard charged that the NLRB “improperly voided a legitimately cast ballot by a proposed unit member because of a small note written on the ballot.”
According to the University’s brief, the ballot contained a “large black ‘X’”  in the box marked “No” in response to whether Harvard students should unionize.  The voter also wrote, “Hello counter! Have a good day” as well as a “smiley face” on the ballot, causing an NLRB official to invalidate it during the vote count.  The University argued that despite the additional writing, the ballot should not have been disqualified because the intent of the voter to vote against unionization was clear.
The union organizers’ objections to the election focus on the voter list the University provided. In a statement, unionization organizers wrote, “Hundreds of student workers were left off the eligible voter list provided by the employer to the NLRB in advance of the election, leading to confusion about who was eligible to vote.”
Union organizers argued that Harvard’s decision to use “preferred names” instead of legal names prevented eligible voters from casting their ballots. “This omission of such a large number of potential voters – a substantially larger number than the margin of the preliminary vote count – prevented a fair, democratic election,” they wrote.
University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven defended the integrity of the election against the organizers’ allegations.
“The University and the HGSU-UAW reached an election agreement to define the eligible voters prior to the vote, and the University worked diligently to develop that voter list,” she wrote. “Our shared goal was and is to count every eligible vote.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 7, 2016, at 10:15 a.m.
Giving power plays to the icemen from Harvard can be dangerous. But handing them 5-on-3s? That’s lethal.
Defending ECAC champion Quinnipiac learned that the hard way Friday night, taking a plethora of penalties early in the second period that provided the nation’s best power play unit with an opportunity to pounce.
Sure enough, the Crimson man advantage struck three times in 44 seconds, including twice on consecutive 5-on-3s, breaking open a one-all game and providing enough cushion for the hosts to skate to a 5-2 victory—their first against the Bobcats since the 2015 postseason.
“We didn’t want to [take penalties], that was part of our game plan,” Quinnipiac associate head coach Bill Riga said. “We lost our heads a little bit, and it got away from us.”
No. 4/3 Harvard (10-2-1, 6-1-1 ECAC) earned its first 5-on-3 after Bobcat co-captain Connor Clifton was called for a slash against Tyler Moy and junior Tanner MacMaster interfered with Ryan Donato 1:22 later. Making matters worse for the visitors, the advantage quickly became more of a 5-on-2.5 after associate captain Tim Clifton lost his stick. Consequently, the Crimson cashed in: freshman Nathan Krusko poked home the go-ahead goal at 5:48, kickstarting what proved to be a career night for the rookie forward.
The goal would be reviewed, but while play came to a halt, the action did not. With the review ongoing, referee Chip McDonald ejected Quinnipiac’s heated head coach, Rand Pecknold, and assessed the Bobcats (11-9-2, 6-5-1) with a two-minute minor for abuse of officials—a rarity by all accounts in college hockey.
That meant another 5-on-3 for Harvard—one that saw co-captain Alexander Kerfoot connect on a back-door pass from Moy at 6:14. Still on a power play because of the residual Pecknold penalty, Krusko tacked on another grinder’s goal right in front of Quinnipiac goaltender Chris Truehl just 18 seconds later, prompting the Bobcats to change netminders with the score 4-1.
“The emotions are always flying high when we play these guys,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They took a few penalties, we had a few reviews that went our way, and I think we did a good job executing on the power play. That ended up being most of the story of the game.”
“We just capitalized,” Kerfoot added. “We’ve had some trouble against them on the power play in the past; they’ve got a really good penalty kill, and at times we’ve struggled to get it into the zone. Coach did a good job of scouting them and showing us what to do on video.”
The Crimson has now scored multiple power-play goals in five straight games, all wins. Harvard’s conversion clip now stands at 33.3 percent for the season, more than 7 percent better than that of the next best team (Omaha).
In a contest that featured 15 minor penalties, Quinnipiac earned six power-play opportunities over the final 30 minutes. But it was not until Luke Shiplo found twine on the final one with 3:05 remaining in regulation that the visitors began to close the gap.
It wasn’t for a lack of trying, however. The Bobcats aggressively had been skating with an extra attacker for five minutes—and through two power plays—by the time Shiplo brought the score to 4-2. But Quinnipiac could not protect its empty net forever. With only six ticks remaining on the clock, Krusko flipped a shot from atop the left circle just inside the near post to secure his first career hat trick.
“Get pucks to the net, and something good will happen,” Krusko said.
Before Krusko helped turn the game in the Crimson’s favor in period two, the Bobcats had chances to change the contest's course early on. Sophomore Thomas Aldworth scored the game’s first goal from the power play at 10:31 in the first period, walking right between two Harvard penalty killers to where he had a clear path towards junior netminder Merrick Madsen.
Other forwards like MacMaster and Tommy Schutt also snuck through the Crimson defense to create “Grade-A” first-period chances, as Ted Donato put it, right in front of Madsen. But the junior made one big stop after another in the period, eventually finishing with a season-high 34 saves.
“That’s about as poor a period as we’ve played as far as the quality of chances we gave up,” Ted Donato said. “I thought we reestablished a little bit of our team identity there in the second and third.”
Senior forward Sean Malone’s team-leading 10th goal of the season—a backhander from Truehl’s left post at 17:01—pushed Harvard into a 1-1 tie heading into the first intermission, setting the stage for the team’s explosion in the middle frame.
The Crimson is now tied for third in the ECAC with Quinnipiac, but with four games in hand. Harvard has two games in hand on Union and St. Lawrence, whom it trails in the standings by four and three points, respectively.
GAME NOTES
—Despite playing Wednesday and Thursday night in Montreal for Team USA at the World Junior Championships, freshman defenseman Adam Fox did return to the lineup on Friday. Yet behind an emerging grin at the podium, Ted Donato said after the game that it wasn't until about 6 p.m. that Fox "cruised in" to join the team.
Nonetheless Fox, who had the option from Donato to sit out this weekend, said that he had planned to play against Quinnipiac all along. He revealed that his legs probably weren't as fresh as he would normally like but that they did the job. Fox wound up having "an Adam Fox type game" too, according to Ted Donato, picking up two assists in the second period.
—In total, Harvard finished 3-for-7 on the power play, while Quinnipiac finished 2-for-8. Thomas Aldworth's first-period tally for the Bobcats snapped a Crimson streak of 12 consecutive penalties killed.
—After being ejected in the second period, Rand Pecknold did not speak to the media.
—Quinnipiac outshot Harvard, 36-34, while the Crimson out-attempted the Bobcats, 70-68.
