After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike many of their fellow seniors at Harvard, Kevin Vaughan and Daniel DiMaria no longer have to worry about finding employment after graduation this May.
Instead, they are on their way to becoming professional lacrosse players, as the two Crimson standouts were selected in the Major League Lacrosse collegiate draft Friday night.
Vaughan, a tri-captain and midfielder from Ridgewood, N.J., was taken in the second round—the 14th pick overall—by the Denver Outlaws. DiMaria, a defenseman from Dix Hills, N.Y., was taken four rounds later—the 41st overall selection—by the Charlotte Hounds, an expansion franchise.
“I’m still taking it all in,” DiMaria said. “I thought I had a good chance [of getting drafted], but you never really know what’s going to happen with that, so I wasn’t sure. It turns out I was, and I’m really pumped about it.”
Vaughan and DiMaria were among a contingent of 12 Ivy Leaguers chosen by the eight-squad league—10 more than in last season’s draft—including Cornell’s Rob Pannell, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year who was taken first overall by the Long Island Lizards.
Pannell was the first player to be taken No. 1 overall out of the Ancient Eight in 11 years. Princeton’s Chad Wiedmaier was also taken in the first round, going seventh to the Hamilton Nationals. On the whole, three Tigers were taken, to go with four from the Big Red, two from Harvard, two from Yale, and one from Penn.
For the second straight year, the draft was held before the start of the upcoming NCAA season so that selected players could join their respective MLL squads directly after their senior years. Only seniors were eligible to be drafted.
Vaughan was taken higher than any player in Crimson history. The only other two Harvard graduates to have been selected in the MLL draft were John Henry Flood ’07 and Jason Duboe ’10. The latter is now a member of the Boston Cannons, who play their home games at Harvard Stadium.
“It’s a great thing for our team,” DiMaria said. “I’m so happy for Kevin; he works really hard. I think this just shows a real positive direction for our program.”
An Inside Lacrosse preseason All-American and an All-Ivy first team choice last season, Vaughan finished third on the team with 19 goals and 27 points in 2011 while serving as a co-captain. DiMaria paced Harvard with 56 ground balls and tied for the team lead with 13 turnovers.
Next season, the duo will look to lead the Crimson, ranked No. 19 in the Inside Lacrosse preseason poll, to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006. But for now, at least, DiMaria is already looking further into the future.
“I love to play lacrosse,” he said. “I can’t wait to start the next chapter of my lacrosse life. Hopefully they give me a chance, and we’ll see what happens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a meet in which three of its members each brought home two individual race wins, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team continued its Ivy League dominance and handily took care of Brown (0-3, 0-2 Ivy), 193-107, Saturday afternoon at Blodgett Pool.
For the Crimson (5-0, 5-0), it was freshman Kelsey Hojan-Clark and senior Meghan Leddy in the pool, and senior Leslie Rea on the diving board, who led the team to the third win of the season where it outscored its opponents by 80 points or more.
“I think it went really well,” Rea said. “A lot of us just got back early yesterday morning, around 4 AM, from our training trip. So, especially considering that, I think it definitely went well. I’m happy with how people did and excited that we won again.”
Junior Caroline Weaver reiterated Rea’s statement, emphasizing the physical toll that the training trip placed on the swimmers and divers.
“What our trip entails is just a huge volume of swimming," Weaver explained. "We were doing doubles every day for eight days straight. I think every body is pretty beaten down. For example, our distance groups on the training trip swam 75,000 yards in a week—which is equivalent to about 46 miles. So I definitely think everybody is pretty tired.”
The meet kicked off with Harvard taking first, second, and third in the 1,650-yard freestyle. Hojan-Clark led all swimmers with a time of 17:04.58, followed by seniors Catherine Zargroba and Kristi Korsberg, who came in at 17:11.68 and 17:32.16, respectively.
This one, two, three finish would occur three times throughout the course of the meet for Harvard. The next of which, the 200-yard backstroke, was also bested by Hojan-Clark. The freshman’s time of 2:06.45 was followed by sophomore Deidre Clute’s 2:06.97 and classmate Danielle Schulkin’s 2:07.77.
In the 500-yard freestyle, Leddy clocked in with an event-best time of 5:02.37. Rookie Ana Anaya trailed the senior by nine seconds and finished in second-place at 5:11.45. Leddy didn’t stop there—she also came in first in the 200-yard butterfly.
Later in the meet, sophomore Sara Li took home the 200-yard IM with a time of 2:08.32. The victory was a close one, as freshman Stephanie Ferrell came in at 2:08.39—only seven hundredths of a second behind.
Senior Alicia Lightbourne led the competition with a time of 24.58 in the 50-yard freestyle. But just like Li’s 200 IM did not come without a challenge, Lightbourne also only barely beat out the next fastest swimmer. This time it was teammate junior Laura Evans who finished the fly only 0.1 seconds behind Lightbourne, at 24.68.
Next, junior Weaver gave the Crimson yet another victory, finishing the 100-yard butterfly in 57.56.
“What’s fun in this meet is that Brown is not our closest competition, so our coach gives us the opportunity to swim events that we don’t ordinarily get to swim during the season,” Weaver said. “For instance, I’m a backstroker, but I swam in the 100 breast and the 100 fly. The fly was actually a great race for me; I won it in a 57, which isn’t blistering fast, but it’s always fun to swim in events that you don’t usually get to swim in.”
In several of the last events of the day, the Harvard freshmen were the ones who pushed their team higher on the scoreboard. Rookie Faith Martin beat out teammates and opponents alike for first place in the 100-yard backstroke. She finished in 57.79, over two seconds before any other swimmer.
Sarah Sumner swam next for the freshmen and completed the 100-yard freestyle in 52.65. She was succeeded by fellow first-year, Courtney Otto, who won the 200-yard breaststroke in a time of 2:20.98.
In the diving portion of the meet, senior Rea swept the events, totaling a score of 281.17 in the one-meter dive, and 333.38 in the three-meter dive.
“I think I did really well,” Rea said. “It’s sometimes hard getting used to different diving boards. You have to figure out how to ride them and get the best jump that you can. Since we haven’t been on the Harvard diving boards for a week and a half, I was a little nervous for today. But it actually turned out well and I’m feeling happy with how I did. It was definitely a personal best.”
In the second of Rea’s events, the three-meter dive, Harvard once again swept the top three places. Freshman Amanda Largent finished her dives with a score of 284.63 followed shortly by junior Brittany Powell and her 284.48 total.
“I think it all goes back to the training trip that we were just on,” Rea explained. “We divers have been in Hawaii for 12 days and had two practices a day literally almost every day that we were there. So there was a lot of training—we put in a lot of time and, today, when we all got up to do our dives, we got the results.”
Rea placed this meet in a line of others, all of which leading to only one goal—the Ivy title.
“We want to win Ivy,” Rea said. “We want a ring. That’s what we want the most right now. That is what we have been working towards, what we have strived for all season, and, especially, what we were going for in this meet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t looking good for the Harvard women’s hockey team midway through the second period of Saturday night’s matchup with Rensselaer. The Crimson trailed by three goals and was unable to get anything past Engineers’ goalkeeper Brianna Piper.
But Harvard dominated the final 25 minutes of play, scoring five unanswered goals to grab a 5-3 win at Bright Hockey Center.
Sophomore Gina McDonald led the way for the Crimson (11-5-1, 8-3-1 ECAC), finishing with her first hat trick of the season. Junior Jillian Dempsey and sophomore Kalley Armstrong also added scores for the Crimson.
After allowing 10 shots on goal in the first period, Harvard clamped down defensively, holding RPI (5-15-4, 2-8-3) to just eight attempts in the final two periods combined.
“A huge character win for us,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Our kids just didn’t quit, and I couldn’t be prouder of them. They played with a lot of moxie. It wasn’t easy, and they just kept believing in themselves and doing what we were trying to get them to do.”
Dempsey sparked the Crimson comeback, beating Piper with a lefty shot that found the back of the net with 3:29 to play in the second period. McDonald followed suit 86 seconds later, scoring a power-play goal.
7:35 into the final period, Armstrong evened the score, scoring off a rebound. McDonald gave the Crimson its first lead less than two minutes later, then sealed the win, scoring on an empty net with 1:04 remaining.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new year usually brings new beginnings. And for the No. 5 Harvard  men’s squash team, the time came for one player to finally make his  much-anticipated collegiate debut.
Sophomore Ali Farag—the  top-ranked junior player in the world and winner of the 2010 Junior  World Championship—played his first game for the Crimson (9-0, 1-0 Ivy)  on Saturday afternoon at the Murr Center in Harvard’s matchup against  No. 9 Penn (3-2, 0-2). A loud audience witnessed Farag’s first win, one  of the nine that the home team mustered against a Quaker squad reeling  from a loss to Princeton in its last matchup.
“It’s so good to be finally playing for Harvard,” said Farag after  his 3-0 individual victory. “I was so nervous at the beginning, so in  the first game I was a little conservative. But I’m eager to play  tomorrow again [against Princeton].”
It was the Crimson’s first contest of 2012—Harvard had a six-week  layoff but barely showed the effects of such a long respite. The Crimson  added an eighth game to its streak of 9-0 wins.
“It was the culmination of hard work,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “There’s always something that as a coach you look out for to make them better for the next match … and what I saw today was good concentration.”
Center court featured three key matchups, starting with sophomore Gary Power against Daniel Judd at the No. 3 spot. After winning the first set, 11-2, Power had less trouble taking the second, hitting several skilled shots to keep his opponent to one point.
Power ran out to a 4-0 lead to start the third set, but Judd showed some life, taking the next two. But the sophomore added four more points to his total before Judd got his third, and Power closed out the set with a 3-1 run, 11-4.
Sophomore Brandon McLaughlin had a relatively harder time against Penn’s Danny Greenberg in the No. 2 matchup. McLaughlin shut out Greenberg for the first three points, but the Quaker closed the gap at 5-3. It was the closest Greenberg got before McLaughlin came out victorious in the first set, 11-6.
The two players ran out to a 3-3 deadlock before McLaughlin created some separation to win the second set, 11-6. Greenberg displayed his frustration in the third set, mustering only four points in a sweep.
“Brandon and Gary had a solid day,” Way said. “They are the leaders of the team—they’re leaders in attitude and work ethic, which is a bonus.”
With all eyes on center court, Farag made his long-awaited debut against Penn’s Thomas Mattsson at the No. 1 spot. The crowd cheered loudly as the sophomore won his first two points easily, but Mattsson was not fazed, scoring four straight points to expose Farag’s nerves.
“I was so nervous in the beginning, but it was my first match,” Farag said.
Farag tied Mattsson at five, and the two traded points until they reached 8-8. Farag put together a 3-0 run to take a close first set, 11-8.
The sophomore seemed more composed in the second set, running out to a 5-1 lead before Mattsson could score his second point. Mattsson played the T well to reduce the deficit to 7-5, but Farag took the next four points to put the Quaker behind, 2-0.
In the final set, Mattsson went up on the scoreboard for the first time since the starting frame, 2-0, before Farag came back to exchange points to tie it at five. The No. 1 junior player then went on a 6-1 run to win his first collegiate match, 11-6.
“In the beginning I wasn’t playing that well because I was nervous, so I was a bit conservative,” Farag said. “I wasn’t going for shots, but in the second and third [sets], I was going for shots, and that made the difference.”
The rest of the team also racked up 3-0 wins, sweeping all nine matchups of the day.
