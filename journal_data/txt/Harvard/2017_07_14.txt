After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Even with the presence of final clubs and Greek life, the College is already in dire need of spaces for social interaction. Last semester, The Crimson Editorial Board bemoaned the lack of physical space for parties and events and, in 2015, the Undergraduate Council pleaded that a library should be turned into a gathering place for freshmen. The administration should seek to add to the social atmosphere on campus, not subtract. Removing institutions like final clubs and fraternities without helping create a replacement will push more students off campus on the weekends to nearby bars and universities, where they are more vulnerable and in more danger.”
	—Kelsey R. Thomas ’20
“The new recommendations on USGSOs address a lot of student concerns that pointed out the exclusive nature of elite social spaces on campus due to a variety of discriminatory factors—not just gender. The proposed policy is particularly responsive to the argument advanced by many single-gender female final clubs that safe spaces are needed for females on campus. As this report makes clear, these spaces are "safe" and comfortable only for elite groups. It’ll be interesting to see how the debate around the true issues of elitism and privilege will be reframed in the student body.” 	—Julie S. Chung ’20
“A ban on exclusivity is not the same as furthered support for inclusivity. On the one hand, Harvard’s size—compared to Williams and Bowdoin—means that enforcement will be far more difficult, and it is likely exclusive social life could be simply driven further underground. On the other, the committee’s proposed restrictions would enable exclusive social spaces to re-form around extracurricular organizations, some of whom already accept members on the basis of subjective and exclusive criteria.”
	—Richard P. Wang ’20
“Despite the controversy, we must trust that the committee has considered first the well-being of our community. They’ve rightfully upheld the myriad opinions from across the College expressed against USGSOs. As we move forward, we must continually remind ourselves of the more subtle considerations that the committee has emphasized surrounding gender discrimination, other forms of injustice, and threats to inclusivity both within and outside USGSOs. We must appreciate the weight of these arguments, challenging ourselves to change the trajectory of our past for the benefit of our community.”
	—Siavash Zamirpour ’20
“This proposal shows how repeatedly the administration has changed its rationale for sanctioning social groups over the years. The pressure was originally directed towards the all-male final clubs due to their higher incidences of sexual misconduct. However, when the sanctions were originally promulgated, they were against all single-sex social organizations—including all-female ones, which did not have the same history of sexual misconduct. The concern thus seemingly changed to all single-sex social organizations condoning gender discrimination. Now, even co-ed groups are under fire due to the possibility that they could still have exclusive practices “that go against the educational mission” of the College. Although the egalitarianism underlying the current rationale may be noble, these shifting, sprawling justifications stymie dialogue with the administration at best and actively diminish trust in it at worst.”
	—Hansy D. Piou ’18
“Social equality among Harvard students must be improved, but the measures are unilaterally harsh towards certain groups. Not all single-gender groups are created equal. The centuries-old Delphic or Fly Clubs almost certainly engender race, class, and social divisions between students, but Harvard's sororities, which are all less than 25 years old, hardly have the same effects. The new suggestions ignore historical and social nuance, as well as the inconvenient truth that students find Harvard’s Houses and other properties unsuitable for socializing, especially with the presence of alcohol.”
	—Robert Miranda ’20
“For how unpopular the original sanctions were, they were inadequate. Final clubs that went co-ed were off the hook without having to substantially address issues of gender discrimination. The policy did nothing to address the fact that clubs are socioeconomically inaccessible cesspools of privilege. This next step is critical for curtailing the power of institutions that hearken to an older version of Harvard, one wrought with even worse sexism and class elitism that gave only a select few men a voice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most people know Dr. S. Allen Counter for the events he has overseen and the individuals he has brought to campus: world leaders, nobel laureates, and Grammy winning singers. He honored a yearly Humanitarian of the Year, put on a science conference for minority grade schools students, and started the portraiture project to commission portraits of diverse individuals to better reflect Harvard’s history. He was known around campus as the larger than life man who would be on a panel in Sanders Theatre between a trip to the Nobel Institute and the Grammys. It was not unusual for Dr. Counter to ask a student if she had time between her studies to join him on a nuclear submarine to present a capsule for the Arctic circle or to identify acapella students to pick up Shakira at the airport. He was a professor of neurotoxicology, an explorer of the Andes and Amazon, as well as Consul General of Sweden.
As Harvard Foundation interns, we knew an entirely different side of Dr. Counter—or as we called him, DC. We knew him as a fierce advocate, a dedicated mentor, and an unwavering source of support.
Dr. Counter was never afraid to take a controversial stand on behalf of his students. When a student wrote graffiti on a Muslim student’s door, telling her to “Go back to her country,” he met with that student individually to make sure that she knew that she was welcome and was supported. After the incident, he worked with the Islamic Society to plan an event on campus to make sure her entire community felt supported.
When black students had the police called on them by their classmates, he was not only the first professor to publicly support the students, but he also met with individual students and set up meetings for us with administrators.
We saw him in his office late at night working on research, bringing in a speaker for the Irish Cultural Society, or working to gain recognition for an unknown African American whose contributions history had ignored.  The more time you spent around Dr. Counter the more you realized that the majority of his time was spent advocating in unseen ways behind closed doors.
After an event, or sometimes during, he would often be joking with David L. Evans, his longtime friend and Senior Admissions Officer at Harvard. They would swap jokes—often the same ones—about who had been there longer, who was older, and who was going bald. This was a man who truly enjoyed working with and on behalf of students.
Dr. Counter carried himself with a palpable presence. When he described you, he would do so in such grand terms that you almost could not recognize yourself.  He had the ability to make you truly believe in your own abilities. As a freshman at Harvard, he told me early on, “Never let anyone tell you that you don’t belong or you aren’t good enough. I will tell you right now that you are, so that you do not need to hear it from others.” I embraced his advice and worked to make Harvard my own, later attending Harvard Medical School and Harvard Business School.
One of my co-workers at the Harvard Foundation, Miguel Garcia ’17, recently returned to complete his studies at Harvard and saw Dr. Counter.  He said of the encounter, “I was nervous to be back at school and terrified of failing again. Though I had never discussed any personal information with him, he patted me on the back and simply stated, ‘My friend, you’ve been gone too long and we’ve missed you dearly. You’ll do just fine.’”
In that moment, with this seemingly ordinary greeting, I felt both disarmed and immensely welcome. This was something only Dr. Counter, with his unmatched class and gravitas, could accomplish. I realize now that his audacity of character and unapologetic presence at a place like Harvard gave us permission to be half as confident as he was. He belonged perfectly and therefore maybe we did too. This gift he handed to thousands of students and colleagues for over four decades.
Dr. Counter’s legacy is much more than the organization he founded and lead for over 35 years, more than events he has put on, and more than the myriad of ways he has shaped Harvard into a more diverse and inclusive place for students of all backgrounds. His true legacy is the students whose lives he has impacted. It is the U.S. Treasurer  who always makes time to mentor and encourage the next generation, the doctor who is better able to connect with her Hindu patient, and the investor who sees the value in the Latino startup. We are grateful for all you have given us, and the people you have made us. Thank you, Dr. Counter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C.—While appearing at 6 p.m. rather than 6 a.m., and with an audience of roughly 350 Harvard affiliates instead of their usual million, hosts of MSNBC’s talk show “Morning Joe” Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough still found plenty to talk about.
Speaking Wednesday evening at the National Archives Building in central Washington, D.C., at an event organized by the Institute of Politics, Brzezinski and Scarborough told Harvard students about their collective experiences working in news media and politics.
The two have hosted “Morning Joe,” MSNBC’s weekday morning news and talk show, together with co-host Willie Geist for the past ten years.
The event was moderated by recently appointed Harvard Corporation member David M. Rubenstein. Rubenstein endowed a permanent namesake exhibit at the National Archives, which houses historic documents that he owns, such as the Magna Carta and a stone copy of the Declaration of Independence. A billionaire with his own television show, Rubenstein maintains an unusually public profile for the newest member of a historically secretive governing body.
Brzezinski told the audience that in her decades of experience in the television industry, “Morning Joe” was unique—and successful.
“We did what we wanted, and we broke all the rules of television immediately,” Brzezinski said.  “I have literally done every television show known to man. Here, we were breaking the mold, and I knew that this was going to be an explosion.”
Brzezinski and Scarborough have joined the IOP as Summer and Fall term visiting fellows. They will travel periodically to Cambridge for events and will collaborate on academic work with Harvard faculty.
“We have been blessed to do so many things that there aren’t a lot of things that excite us, but this is a great honor for us,” Scarborough said of the fellowship.
The couple also discussed their relationship with President Donald Trump. The pair communicated extensively with Trump during his campaign and he was often a guest caller on their show.
Two weeks ago, Trump, disgruntled with the couple’s criticism of him on their show, tweeted a series of derogatory statements about Brzezinski and Scarborough, drawing widespread criticism from lawmakers and political commentators alike.
The two said that while they previously had a personal relationship with the president—Scarborough offered the then-candidate advice and the pair subsequently visited Trump at the White House—that rapport had disappeared in recent months.
“We don’t talk. Things have kind of devolved,” Brzezinski said, to laughs from the audience.
Scarborough said that amid scandals racking the Trump presidency, it is important for news media and the general public to be cognizant of the larger, national picture. “In the age of Trump, I think the greatest challenge is keeping everything in context,” he added.
Asked by one audience member about his recent deflection from the Republican Party, which drew headlines Wednesday, Scarborough said it was “a long time coming.”.
Chief among his grievances with the party was its members’ failure to denounce what he viewed as racist comments by President Trump.
“What bothered me the most was that the Republican Party, and its leaders, and so many others had so many reasons why they didn’t support Donald Trump, but I never heard it was because he was a racist,” Scarborough said.
He added that the GOP’s recent health care bill was “the last straw,” describing it as “heartless” and  “shameful.”
Brzezinski and Scarborough, who recently announced their engagement, also revealed they are considering holding their wedding in Nantucket. “If Bill Delahunt promises to go,” Scarborough joked.
The pair will hold more events in Cambridge as their fellowships at the IOP get underway this fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after racially-focused protests rocked Harvard Law School, a student, faculty, and alumni task force has recommended changes to improve diversity and inclusion across the school.
Though the task force was appointed by former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, the school’s new dean, John F. Manning ’82, sent the report to Law School affiliates July 5, writing that he is “delighted” to have the opportunity to make use of the report’s findings. The report recommends that the school take additional steps to bolster advising programs, mental health resources, and financial aid at the school.
Manning wrote in an emailed statement that the report’s findings were extensive and gave him a significant amount to work with as he began his tenure as dean.
“The Task Force did a tremendous amount of work and made extensive findings and recommendations across a wide range of subjects touching on our academic community,” Manning said.
Law School professor Bruce H. Mann, who chaired the committee, said that the Task Force focused on identifying the opportunities and challenges that a law school as large and diverse as Harvard faces.
“The opportunities lie in bringing together people of different races, genders, ethnicities, gender identities, nationalities, political views, religious affiliations, incomes, career aspirations, and experiences to learn from and alongside one another and to engage in the free exchange of ideas that is essential to the rigorous pursuit of knowledge,” Mann said. “The challenges lie in creating the conditions that foster inclusion and respect for differences and that enable everyone to discuss, debate, and disagree on difficult issues and topics.”
Though all of the committee’s faculty members signed the report, only two of four student members did so. All four student members and one faculty member, Susan P. Crawford, signed an addendum highlighting what they saw as the shortcomings of the process, specifically focusing on influence of the faculty perspective on the report.
The report, however, indicates that the addendum did not contradict any of its findings or recommendations.
Cameron D. Clark, a student member of the task force, said he did not sign the report because he thought it fell short of addressing what the task force had been asked to investigate.
“I did not sign on to the Task Force Report because, in my opinion, the report did not reflect the critical investigative rigor expected of us in the Dean’s charge,” Clark said. “Whether by necessity or by choice, we failed to engage all stakeholders in the academic community.”
Mann said the students’ dissent was not unexpected and that he foresees it being a significant part of future discussions.
“Vigorous discussion is what law schools do,” Mann said. “I expected no less from the student members of the Task Force.  I fully expect that their addendum will be part of the discussions going forward.”
