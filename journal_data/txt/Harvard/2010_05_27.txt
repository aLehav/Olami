After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elizabeth H. Dole is known today as a former Republican Senator for the state of North Carolina, former candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, and the wife of Presidential candidate Bob Dole. But fifty years ago, she was a graduate student at Harvard.
As a student at the Graduate School of Education in 1960 and a member of the Harvard Law School’s class of 1965, Dole said she found Cambridge to be full of exciting opportunities. “There were all sorts of new experiences for a Southern girl, like learning to ski and ice skate and attending lectures in the Harvard community,” she said.
Dole, who had been a political science major at Duke, said she thought it “would be a great decision” to attend the School of Education because it offered a one-year program that allowed her to blend teaching with her interest in government.
“Student teaching was one of the most interesting times of my years there. I was teaching U.S. history and I wanted to make the pages come alive for the students,” said Dole, citing an instance when she found a man who had participated in the Boston police strike to come speak to her class while she was teaching about the subject.
Although Dole, despite encouragement from her professors, ultimately decided not to become a teacher, she said her education degree has come in handy during her political career—especially as she developed her public speaking style.
“When I was president of the Red Cross, I enjoyed walking out from behind the podium to visit with people in the audience,” Dole said. “I have a conversational style that comes from the days as a student teacher, when you’re walking up and down the aisles.”
This style became particularly newsworthy when she employed it at the 1996 Republican National Convention in support of her husband’s presidential campaign. “I was going down 12-15 steps in heels and talking, which was challenging but was an effective way to get your point across to the audience,” she said.
This friendly nature was evident even during her time at Harvard, according to Michael S. Saper, a classmate who sat next to Dole in a public international law class at the Law School. “She was a very nice person who was bright and attractive,” he said. “As I look back at my classmates, she was one of my favorites.”
Many of her later colleagues also said that this likability extended into her career.
“There are long hours working in government but you always knew that she was working just as hard, or harder, than you were,” said Kerry Tymchuk, who served as Dole’s speechwriter for many years. “She wakes up every morning wanting to make a positive difference.”
Dole said that throughout her career she has always tried to serve the public. She cited her work at the Department of Transportation and the American Red Cross as her proudest achievements in the years since she left Harvard.
At the Department of Transportation, Dole said she dedicated much of her time to automobile safety by targeting laws to increase the use of safety belts and airbags.
“I felt the most important thing I could do was take on safety in a major way; it meant saving lives and preventing crippling injuries,” she said.
During her tenure at the American Red Cross, Dole led a complete overhaul of the way blood was organized and distributed. “The Red Cross provides half of America’s blood, and the World War II infrastructure was out of date,” she said.
The American Red Cross provided Dole with the opportunity to become the first female president since its founding by Clara Barton in 1881. Many of Dole’s closest colleagues said they believe that she has consistently been a strong woman in politics.
“In Washington, she was often the only woman in the room when decisions were being made. She felt pressure to do well, and be a pioneer for other women. It’s been a lifetime of firsts since leaving Harvard,” Tymchuk said.
Dole was also committed to giving other qualified women opportunities to move up in the ranks, particularly through her initiatives at the Department of Transportation. “There have been times when I’ve been through airports when a woman would run after me and say, ‘Ms. Dole I want to talk to you. I’m the manger of this airport and I’m here because of the women’s program at the Department of Transportation.’”
But Dole has made a difference in her daily life as well as in her political life, according to her assistant, Gia M. Colombraro. “I truly find all the time that I learn something from her every day,” she said. “She would have made a great teacher.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two major changes shaped the University this year, one planned and one unplanned. The first was the shift in the College’s academic calendar, which most notably put fall-term exams in December and lengthened the winter break to almost five weeks. One noticeable effect was a compressed academic schedule in the fall, which made Thanksgiving break as well as the shorter reading period more stressful for students. While we originally supported the calendar change on the grounds that it could reduce stress, that was evidently not its effect this year. The administration and faculty should work to adjust deadlines and workloads to better fit this new schedule, and students should go into next year prepared to cope with the demands of the new schedule.
The calendar change also resulted in a much longer winter vacation. Unfortunately, the administration’s original plan to offer optional programming during this period was eliminated for budgetary reasons. This time period is a valuable opportunity for Harvard to offer supplementary courses for students. The school’s new proposal for a week of programming next year at the end of winter break is simply insufficient compared to, for example, the extensive four-week program MIT offers. Harvard should continue to expand its offerings during January until we have a program that is long enough to provide students with a more comprehensive and deep academic experience. Until then, the administration should broaden its support for students who want to remain on campus during January, including allowing more students who want to engage in extracurricular activities to stay and should offer support such as travel grants for other students.
The other major pressure that Harvard faced was the continuation of the budget crisis that struck the University last year. Harvard’s endowment plummeted nearly 30 percent, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences budget deficits led to many cuts in services. The most visible sign of this may have been the absence of hot breakfasts in the Houses, but other cuts include shrinking library and Bureau of Study Counsel hours. While none of the actions that the University has been forced to take have been unreasonable, administrators should be sure to continue with trepidation.
For example, the Report of the Task Force on University Libraries issued by the University calls for a centralization of the Harvard University Library System, engaging in exchanges with other school libraries, and a transition toward a greater digital rather than physical collection. While these reforms are ultimately positive and particularly helpful in times of budgetary crisis, the University should never let these reforms affect its priority of continuing to accumulate and preserve our own physical collection.
The University’s offering of early retirement packages to professors is another choice that, although necessary in these circumstances, could undermine students’ academic experiences by eliminating some of the most experienced faculty at Harvard. Although this does offer the opportunity to hire new younger faculty, the net effect of the attrition and replacement may be different in different departments, depending on Harvard’s hiring priorities. We hope that Harvard does not have to diminish any area of its course offerings as a result of professors leaving. That said, some measures that the University is taking, such as two-percent merit-based raises for professors and three-percent raises in graduate-student stipends, are unlikely to have anything more than symbolic value.
The suspension of the Harvard Law School’s Public Service Initiative that provided funding for students at the Law School interested in working in public service, is one of the more irresponsible cuts made by the University. Budget cuts should not interfere with the school’s commitment to support students who make the difficult choice to dedicate their lives to serving others, and suspending this program is a disservice both to those students and to the people they could have helped.
We are pleased that the University is making an effort to uphold certain commitments even in spite of budget cuts. Development of the University’s Allston project has somewhat stalled this year due to cuts, but some encouraging progress has been made in certain areas, including a land concession that allows residential development, helping dull the negative effect that halting construction could have on Allston development. We are also glad that the University plans to continue its long-needed project of renewing undergraduate housing despite the budgetary pressure and believe that increasing living space, social space, and privacy in the Houses is a crucial priority.
One common target of criticism regarding the budget is Harvard’s financial management. Harvard’s risky investment strategies earned public criticism for their role in the diminishing of the endowment, which has severely affected the Harvard community. However, these strategies were responsible for Harvard’s enormously high returns in previous years, and we believe that Harvard’s investment practices are ultimately correct in intention. Some have also criticized donations to Harvard, arguing that there are more effective ways to spend money charitably. However, Harvard serves an important role in improving the world and its community: a role that is significantly supported by alumni donations. Furthermore, discouraging those with a passion for education from donating to Harvard is more likely to reduce overall philanthropy than redirect it.
It has been a difficult year for the University; Ultimately, however, it is not the short-term but rather the long-term consequences of budgetary pressure that should be most feared. As long as Harvard does not lose sight of its ultimate objectives during this period and continues to invest in its future and its community, the budgetary crisis will be remembered as only a temporary burden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Health care, gay rights, immigration, and energy were the rallying points on the charted field for political battles in late 2009 and early 2010.
President Barack H. Obama made good on his health-care reform promise, while Republicans likewise made good on less constructive aspirations to delay it—a debate that we commented on with equal parts optimism and skepticism. The House of Representatives 220-215 vote represented a bittersweet victory, moving sweeping health-care legislation forward at the necessary cost of the unjust Stupak Amendment. The national debate reached fever pitch and the bill seemed doomed as it stalled for months in Congress, prompting us to take up a call for legislative reconciliation despite criticism from Republicans who, hypocritically, have historically taken full advantage of the tactic. In the end, reconciliation gave what was perhaps the most sweeping legislation since the Johnson administration a place in the annals of history and U.S. law.
This marked only the beginning in a long series of political debates and snafus that would come to define fall 2009 and spring 2010. The tragic shooting at Fort Hood laid bare the inadequacies of mental-health offerings in the United States military and showed us that terrorism is not the sole province of religion. Similarly, reactions to the threat of terrorism represented not change that we could believe in, but rather the stasis that we feared. We were disappointed by Obama’s renewal of the Patriot Act, a bill whose overwhelming Congressional support was cause for alarm, not comfort, as the legislation remains an infraction against freedom. The bill represented and still represents an unnecessary forfeiture of a Supreme Court-affirmed right to privacy.
Progress on the gay-rights front was more encouraging and elicited our praise. Bigoted animus was shown the legislative door with the inclusion of gays in laws protecting groups from hate crimes. Such legislation will be necessary as long as there is targeted violence—it is a corrective tool that we are glad now protects homosexual individuals.
The Washington, D.C. City Council made bold steps toward institutionalizing gay marriage in October, steps that we encouraged Congress not to override. A similar endeavor was undertaken in Maine with the vote on “Question One” but yielded less success because voters opposed gay marriage. However, the debate itself highlighted a problem in the very understanding of civil unions: Marriage itself is a religious institution that is inappropriately included in public law, and thus all marriages should instead be legally defined as secular “civil unions.” Despite the disappointment in Maine, we saw hope’s silhouette once again with Obama’s reaffirmation of his commitment to gay rights during the State of the Union address, in which he promised to repeal the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy.
Preceding Obama’s address, Senator Scott P. Brown’s victory in Massachusetts drew our attention. The win prompted much political punditry and analysis of Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley’s gaffes. Instead of focusing on her mistakes, we voiced our conviction that—following Brown’s victory—Democrats must not only deliver results, but also do so in a bipartisan manner.
That spirit of level-headed bipartisanship proved hard to come by as the climate-change and energy debates came to the fore. Obama’s move in April to promote offshore drilling was an unnecessary and unsavory concession whose political benefits do not outweigh the consequences to the environment. It represented not thoughtful compromise, but rather the political strong-arming that yields poor policy.
We reiterated time and time again that the proper way to address the energy and climate-change crises is to explore alternative-energy sources, including nuclear power. Obama’s February decision to commit $8.3 billion to construct new nuclear reactors in Georgia reassured us that the administration understood the technology’s possible benefits. However, we also asserted that nuclear power is not the only potential silver bullet, and the president should keep an open mind about other alternative-energy options.
Political oddities punctuated these national-level debates throughout the academic year. Obama’s surprise Nobel Peace Prize reflected a poor decision on the prize committee’s part, but we recognized the grace and humility with which Obama handled a politically delicate situation. In contrast, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele inappropriately behaved in an outlandish fashion that was an embarrassment to the Republican Party. His involvement in the strip-club funding debacle and indelicate handling of racial issues evinced our argument that the RNC had no one but itself to blame for choosing such an incompetent character to head the party.
As the academic year’s end drew near, some of the gravest transgressions against justice manifested in the national issue of immigration policy. The passage of Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 represents the worst of our nation’s approaches to problem solving. Its reliance on specious standards of “reasonable suspicion” that seemed to entail nothing further than “looking” like an illegal immigrant remains unacceptable. More horrifying, perhaps, this bill will negatively affect the nation’s Hispanic and Latin-American communities, who will undoubtedly be the first to suffer from profiling and the last to have a say in it.
The national political landscape has certainly changed over the last 12 months, and much of that change has been for better. Still, reactionary responses to big issues sully the national discourse and subject complex problems to the visceral, not the cerebral. Only by adopting a level-headed, considerate, and thoughtful approach to national policies can we craft the idealized American community that we strive to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the University facing an austere new budget and an overhauled academic calendar, student life saw numerous changes in fall 2009 and spring 2010. Budget cuts were the theme of the year and had far-reaching effects across all aspects of student life. Overall, students and the University made the best of the situation with reasonable, cost-effective compromises that generally maintained student happiness.
Starting in the fall, we welcomed the University’s extension of its efforts to “go green.” Harvard received a top spot on the Princeton Review’s 2010 Green Rating Honor Roll, proving that the school is making good on its promise that green is the new crimson. Commendable measures that the University undertook this year involve installing solar trash compactors around campus, including compostable materials at the popular Fly-By eatery in the basement of Memorial Hall, and encouraging students to recycle, leading to a high 55 percent campus-wide recycling rate. We are also proud that Harvard instituted its new Green Building Guidelines for projects costing over $5 million. Such long-term commitments—which have brought the University wide recognition for leadership in the green arena—are worthwhile because they promote habits of sustainability among students and aim to protect the environment. We are also appreciative of the new community garden; the centrally-located plot of land by Lowell House serves as a hands-on classroom, fully functional garden, and an encouraging sign of Harvard’s commitment to sustainability being a part of students’ everyday live.
The University’s commitment to the environment is especially commendable in the face of the severe budget cuts that hit practically every aspect of University operations. Overall, the administration did a good job making reasonable compromises and providing cheaper alternatives to some of its more expensive habits of old. Considering the highly publicized 27 percent plunge in the University’s endowment, student life suffered relatively little. Notably, Quadlings returned to campus to find that their weekend-morning shuttle service had been cut. Though disappointing, this seems to us a reasonable compromise in the face of the original plan to make much more extensive sacrifices—the administration did well to heed student uproar over shuttle cuts and backtrack.
The cut that riled up students most, however, was the cessation of weekday hot breakfast in House dining halls at the beginning of the year. Although not as damaging to students as other cuts that were originally suggested, we still believe the College should listen to students’ requests to bring back eggs in the morning in the Houses, given that the lack of hot breakfast caused so much of an outcry on campus that it became nationally reported. We are glad that the Undergraduate Council in particular was involved in working with the administration to rectify what many students find to be a great injustice. Hot breakfast was a large part of the winning Bowman-Hysen ticket’s election platform, and the new leadership did well to submit to the administration a sensible list of cost-neutral solutions for improving the breakfast situation.
Our commendation of the UC’s actions regarding hot breakfast, however, is not to ignore the general air of incompetence that continued to surround the UC this year. Over the summer, the council attempted to raise $6 million in an ill-conceived and complex strategy to build a new student center at 45 Mount Auburn St. The ineffective campaign barely covered its own operating costs, netting only $700, and out of sheer embarrassment, the UC spun the campaign off as a completely separate entity upon the start of the school year.
Yet the student-center campaign debacle paled in comparison to the election scandal that enveloped the UC later in the year. The Election Commission lost all credibility in our eyes and was the embodiment of gross negligence and irresponsibility due to its failure to address known vulnerabilities in the online-voting system and because of its early release of confidential voting results to the outgoing vice president and the wider community. We were quite glad to hear that the Election Commission will be reformed in the future.
There were, however, a few bright spots with the advent of the Bowman-Hysen administration. A contentious but generally well-regarded effort to create a study-guide library unfortunately fell flat after the UC tried but failed to convince the faculty of its academic merits. By the end of the year, however, the UC successfully managed to work out a deal to have an automated teller machine installed in the old Hilles library, finally filling a void in the wallets of the hundreds of students trapped between Shepard and Linnaean Streets. Additionally, the UC worked with the administration to revamp the Student Initiated Programming fund. In a nod to the legacy of the defunct Party Fund, a third of SIP grant money can now be used to buy alcohol so long as the host does not drink and takes measures not to serve underage guests, making it a very welcome addition to the Harvard party scene.
In a telling corollary, even with ever-stricter alcohol regulation on campus, significantly more students were admitted to Stillman Infirmary for alcohol-related illness than in any previous year. We argue that Harvard’s alcohol policies push students who want to drink, particularly freshmen, to unsafely binge before going to a party rather than drink socially at the party itself. The school’s relatively new amnesty policy, which protects ill students and those who escort them to Stillman from disciplinary action, is a good one. But even if it is only this newfound comfort that is pushing the number of alcohol-related admissions steadily upward, the College ought to be more innovative with how it combats the particularly dangerous drinking culture.
Possibly the greatest development in student life came from the revamped academic calendar. This year, Harvard ended its generations-long tradition of holding first-semester exams after winter break, opting instead to do away with intersession, start and end the school year earlier, and standardize its schedule with those of most other American universities. Although we were originally positive about the calendar change, we were disappointed by the lack of programming over J-Term, as what actually came to fruition was rather different than what was originally planned. We hope that, in the future, more options will be available to students so that they are not forced to stay at home for five weeks.
Overall, the year was a relatively positive one for students. Although we have some complaints, we feel that budget cuts could have had a much more harmful impact than they did in the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, we saw a series of crises and misadventures rattle the entire world’s peace of mind, be it the continuing global economic malaise or the steady disintegration of order in Europe and Central and Western Asia. However, throughout this period of global hardship and struggle, we also witnessed harbingers of happier economic times and a safer, less turbulent world.
Europe, in particular, has faced difficulties this year. Caught in the rising tide of anti-Muslim hysteria—a product of a dysfunctional immigration system and a chronic failure to assimilate new immigrants—normally mild-mannered Switzerland passed a measure banning minarets, a law we passionately decried. We feel that this legislation is discriminatory against an embattled minority and only further alienates, and thus radicalizes, European Muslims.
Another small European country—Greece—also found itself on the brink of disaster. We held that it would be wrong for the people of France and Germany, two of the only European nations with fiscal houses in comparative order, to devote their own tax dollars to reward the Greek government’s gross profligacy and egregious irresponsibility. Instead, we advocated for a bailout of Greece by the International Monetary Fund, as the stigma associated with such a bailout was well-deserved in this case. Additionally, members of the European Union should not have had to further surrender their political sovereignty to unelected bureaucrats in hopes of resolving the EU’s economic and fiscal difficulties, as the people of those states have time and again rejected further centralization.
The Ukraine also faced crisis, in the realm of health rather than economics. We condemned the country for adopting a policy of banning public gatherings to combat the H1N1 “pandemic,” because such a measure would compromise democracy, especially in an election year.
In a controversy that plagued not just Europe, but also the entire world, a sex-abuse scandal arose in the Catholic Church. We appreciate Pope Benedict XVI’s letter of apology, but note that he was misguided in invoking faith as a solution to the crisis. We advocate treating the occurrence of abuse by priests foremost as a law-enforcement issue because we feel that no one, not even the clergy, should be above the law. We also believe that the Church could do more to handle the epidemic of pedophilic priests from a management perspective, decentralizing authority to local dioceses and providing instructional courses about how to report incidents of abuse.
Moving east to Afghanistan, we bemoaned the withdrawal of presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah, the chief opponent of President Hamid Karzai, from a hotly contested race plagued by allegations of fraud, terming the decision premature. Abdullah’s concession to Karzai dispossessed the Afghan government of any democratic legitimacy, thus depriving the country of much-needed stability. The implication of this politically expedient maneuver, we concluded, was that the United States could not afford to factor in the chimerical prospect of a stable democracy in Afghanistan as it considers its policy toward the region.
In spite of these setbacks, however, we see some signs of progress manifest around the world. In India, a country long dogged by misogyny, we took heart in a bill that promises to establish quotas for the number of women in Parliament. However, in spite of its positive sentiments, we did voice concern about the possibility that the bill could further marginalize minorities, such as Muslims.
Uruguay also made strides this year. We found much to praise about a program handing out free laptops to every child there, which promises to enhance technological literacy and proliferate access to information, thereby helping lift these children out of poverty.
We also were pleased to see the arrest of Hollywood director and part-time child rapist Roman Polanski by the Swiss police. We expressed disgust at the arguments made by some in Hollywood that Polanski deserved clemency due to being an artist, as if artists were above the law. We reject this hypocritical position and asserted firmly that the law is the law.
Finally, we are heartened by the new approach to foreign policy adopted by President Obama. We brushed aside criticisms of the president’s chronic bowing habit, as bowing, to the Japanese emperor in particular, is nothing more than a harmless gesture that cultivates trust and respect.
We praise the president’s approach to China, applauding his decision to meet with the Dalai Lama like all presidents before him, as we believe attention ought to be paid to China’s human rights abuses and unconscionable occupation of Tibet. We were also thrilled at his successful attempt to reach a pact with the Chinese on climate change, although we noted that the speeches offered by Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao were little more than words until they yield actions. On the subject of China, we were also pleased by Google’s decision to pull out of the country to protest its censorship laws.
Still, courting the Chinese is important, we feel, for China’s cooperation is crucial in establishing a united global front against Iranian nuclear intransigence. Russia is another such crucial ally, hence our praise for Obama’s decision to scale back the U.S. missile defense program in Poland as a sign of goodwill toward the Russians. This choice was particularly sensible given the expensiveness and relative uselessness of such missile-defense programs. Obama’s efforts to please Russia ostensibly paid off when Russian President Dmitry Medvedev verbally backed the concept of sanctions against Iran, a sea change in Russian policy regarding Iran. Nevertheless, in spite of our commitment to diplomacy and reconciliation, we took a tough line against Iran, firmly calling for the U.S. to condemn the nation’s uranium enrichment, crack down on domestic corporations doing business there, and aggressively forge an international coalition against the rogue regime.
Obama’s approach to Israel also pleases us. We reiterated our hope for a peace agreement regarding the conflict over Gaza but established that any compromise must not come at the expense of human rights. Finally, we determined that it was best for the U.S. to end its rubber-stamp approval of all of Israel’s policies and for the two nations to scale down their alliance.
As countries struggled to cope with the changing circumstances ushered in this year, their responses leave us largely concerned. However, Obama’s leadership gives us hope that the U.S.’s presence on the international stage will continue to be a positive one in the year to come.

Since the inauguration of President Barack H. Obama, the nature and structure of American education have elicited unprecedented amounts of discussion, debate, and dialogue. With the president’s policies beginning to take root, fundamental changes—most of which we support—have begun to shape our nation’s public schools and universities. Outside of the White House, however, a series of worrisome events and trends suggests that American education, even at the college and university level, is still subject to a climate of continued anti-intellectualism and a widespread distrust of the student enterprise.
In a general sense, we support the core of President Obama’s education initiatives: heavy on spending and tough on teachers. Specifically, we were pleased with his allocation of $4.35 billion to the “Race to the Top” initiative that gives states an immediate monetary incentive to monetary incentive to reform dilapidated public schools. As part of the broader American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Race to the Top—a small fraction of the total $96.8 billion allocated to the Department of Education under the stimulus package—is a wise investment. The program counters the influence of unions and defers to the longstanding autonomy of local school boards in order to implement policies those boards consider worthwhile. The program also introduces a bit of competition into the equation, as grants will only be awarded to a small percentage of the states that apply—a condition that can only benefit students as states attempt to find innovative ways to out-reform one another. So much for the charges of socialism so commonly hurled at Obama’s Washington.
In turn, our views on education at the national level have informed our opinions on the issues that confront local Boston schools. In April, for instance, when Superintendent Carol R. Johnson announced a bold plan to revamp 12 underperforming schools, we initially considered her proposal to be counterproductive; It essentially requires teachers to work extra hours without extra pay. Of greater importance, however, we ultimately believe that following union demands to eliminate all the reform measures would fail to improve the quality of teaching in Boston. In the coming months, we urge the Boston public school system to focus instead on implementing Johnson’s suggested pay-for-performance plan that—we hope—will show teachers that their performance is valued on an individual level, encouraging them to focus on improving their own work as best they can.
Looking beyond the implementation of the president’s policies, however, several troubling occurrences within the world of education this year have roused far too little attention. In Utah, for instance, a senator faced with the understandably daunting task of closing Utah’s large budget gap proposed making 12th grade optional in order to save the state around $60 million. Although we understand the magnitude of the financial pressures confronting Utah and other states, making the final year of high school nonobligatory sends the wrong message. It further devalues schooling in an age when public opinion has come to doubt the value of education qua education. Despite the necessity of budget cuts in a time of fiscal difficulty, the field of education should be protected at all costs.
On a related note, we were also concerned to learn that the University of the Pacific’s Distinctive Candidate Application affords students the opportunity to apply to college using a pre-filled application with no essay or candidate profile requirement. Again, in an age when the budget crisis has only fanned the flames of anti-intellectualism in the United States, this method of applying to institutions of higher education is disturbingly detached. After all, is a signature the only item an admissions office needs to cast a value judgment on a candidate? For the same reasons, the new practice of outsourcing higher-education grading to companies based in Malaysia and India is troubling; the imperfections in a student’s paper cannot be fixed like a technological glitch. These trends serve as additional evidence that the increasing commoditization and impersonality of education cannot be ignored.
Another issue faced the world of higher education this year in the form of unpaid internships. All too often, students must work without compensation in order to gain entry-level positions in various job fields, and we feel that this practice goes against the ideal of fairness by which employers should abide. After all, only a certain percentage of the population can afford to do an unpaid internship, perpetuating inequality. To best remedy this, we feel that the United States should eliminate unpaid internships altogether, except for those at non-profit organizations.
Finally, we were appalled to learn that local police devalued the work of our colleagues at James Madison University’s student newspaper, The Breeze. Allegedly, 926 photographs were confiscated from its newsroom to be used as evidence for a campus riot, an action that violated the integrity and independence of these journalists. Regrettably, we felt it necessary to reiterate the idea that student newspapers are respectable journalism outlets and should receive the coverage of the Privacy Protection Act of 1980. By the same token, we also regret that national newspapers have relaxed their coverage of higher education. This leaves colleges and universities responsible for publicizing their own achievements and findings to the world at large. In an age when education is so frequently discussed but also undervalued, unbiased and widely distributed reporting on these is issues should be a priority.

Only a handful of students typically approach economics concentration adviser Jonathan V. Hall ’06 in the days before the deadline for handing in completed study cards.
But on the day signed study cards are due, Hall says he witnesses a line of students that stretch inside the department’s Littauer Building, forcing some individuals to wait for hours on end.
“I know who has to sign my study card, but it’s kind of unclear who my advisor actually is,” says Katherine He ’10, an economics concentrator who reconsidered plans to pursue a graduate degree in economics partially because of “the lack of help that was present in the undergraduate economics department.”
In an effort to remedy this ambiguity, the economics department, which sees the largest number of concentrators in the College, is engaging in large-scale reforms of its advising programs, further centralizing its advising structure by eliminating three of the seven graduate student concentration advisers, replacing them with one dedicated staff concentration adviser.
This centralization breaks from the advising model for government, the College’s second largest concentration, which will introduce an undergraduate peer counseling system to bolster a wider sense of community.
Together, the revisions of the two advising systems will impact one in four Harvard students.
Both concentrations have suffered from poor advising in the past: A 2001 survey of Harvard seniors showed that economics and government concentrators rated the quality of their departmental advising at 2.57 and 2.62, respectively, compared to the college average of a 3.19 on a five-point scale.
In subsequent years, the two departments have undertaken reforms that reflect contrasting ideologies about advising.
The economics department seeks to centralize its program by employing fewer, but more specialized, advisers in Littauer. On the other hand, the government department hopes to disperse its advising resources to reach a wider range of students.
The newest changes in advising in these two departments reflect these differing philosophies—but questions remain as to whether either reform will be successful in improving students’ satisfaction with the guidance that they receive.
‘DO IT BY YOURSELF’
Three years ago, the economics department transitioned from using tutors in Harvard’s residential Houses as concentration advisers to employing a group of seven graduate students to advise students out of offices in Littauer.
According to Jeffrey A. Miron, the director of undergraduate studies in economics, the original system had presented a number of substantive issues for the department.
“Sometimes we could not find an adviser for every House,” he says. “Sometimes we had issues with quality control.”
But the reformed system of advising appears to have bred a sense of detachment between the department and concentrators.
Advisers expect undergraduates to personally seek them out, and students say they feel alienated from advising resources—a sharp contrast to the advising system’s mission as expressed by economics undergraduate program administrator Emily R. Neill, who oversees the administration of the advising program.
“For me, advising is about making students feel like we know who they are,” Neill says.
Yet Hall says that he does not know the names of all of his 150 advisees, mainly due to lack of student traffic into his office in Littauer.
Concentrators agree that their advisers very rarely know their names, as the graduate students typically only meet their advisees in study card signing lines.
“I don’t know anyone [in economics] who used their adviser for anything—ever,” says Jason D. Sherman ’10, an economics concentrator.
Sherman adds that he believes Economics provides an “extreme example” of a concentration where students receive relatively little guidance.
“The whole culture in the economics department seems to be ‘learn it by yourself,’ or ‘do it by yourself,’” He says.
THE AUDACITY OF SATISFACTION
The economics department’s hypothetical long-term plan is to hire up to three staff concentration advisers, who will replace all seven graduate advisers. Though the number of economics advisers would be cut by more than half, the department’s hope is that the incoming staff adviser would bring a specialized interest to the job.
Sherman says he is excited about the new structure because “a staff member might know more, and be able to dedicate more time to advising.”
But economics concentrator Colin J. Motley ’10 says that the loss of a graduate student adviser might actually increase the disconnect between students and advising resources, since a staff adviser may be less integrated into the department and may “not be the kind of person that you want to talk to in a meaningful way.”
Faculty in the economics department express similarly mixed views about the potential benefits of the change.
Department chair John Y. Campbell says that while he has been concerned about the recent ratings for economics advising on senior surveys, he is “very optimistic” that further consolidation could provide improved experience for concentrators.
“Hopefully students will come to know the adviser, come to trust that person, and word of mouth may have a beneficial effect,” Campbell says.
Yet the low scores for economics advising on the senior survey may not even necessarily be a function of poor advising quality, according to Miron.
“I think our low score for advising on the senior survey is partially reflecting dissatisfaction with the large classes in the economics concentration,” he says.
A GOV CONNECTION
Though government—Harvard’s other mammoth concentration—is making a parallel move toward advising reform, its tactics mark a significant departure from the principles guiding the economics department’s decisions.
In 2006, the government concentration switched to House-based advising after working with a hybrid of House advising and centralized advising based in CGIS for a number of years.
The residential concentration advisers operate within an official advising capacity and are capable of signing students’ study cards. They are also responsible for holding weekly office hours and meet on a monthly basis to discuss upcoming deadlines and other concerns.
A number of government concentration advisers praise the system for the ways in which it allows them to bring advising directly to students.
“At 10 o’clock at night in the dining hall, I can recommend classes or answer questions,” says Brodi J. Kemp, theLowell House government tutor. “It’s really nice to have that.”
In a reflection of the desire to maintain a government advising community, Kemp says that  the department has also pushed to ensure that the majority of the House advisers are residential tutors, as opposed to non-res tutors who are merely affiliated with a House.
“I think the residential House advisers are so convenient,” government concentrator Bradford O. Bailey ’10 says. “The advisers are mentors and models for academic life and academic issues.”
And the newest advising reform—the recruitment of a group of rising juniors and seniors to serve as peer concentration counselors (PCCs)—will help the department further develop a sense of community among concentrators and advisers, administrators say.
Cheryl B. Welch, director of undergraduate studies for the government department, says the PCCs will provide concentrators “another contact for course selection” and will encourage “conversations about the courses and the material,” while drawing on personal experience.
Welch adds that while she hopes to further improve government advising in the future, she plans to maintain the House-based system as the central pillar of the department’s advising.
“It seems to be a fairly good way of bridging the gap, of bringing down a big concentration to a manageable size,” Welch says.
THE WIDER DISCUSSION
As the concentration advising systems in economics and government continue to evolve over the coming years, the successes and failures of these programs may inform the structuring of advising in other Harvard departments.
As Campbell notes, economics has already drawn “inspiration” from the life sciences, which has used a staff advising system for several years.
Both Welch and Karen Kaletka, coordinator of undergraduate studies in the government department, express interest in seeing how the economics department’s changes in advising might influence senior exit survey results—information that could possibly be used to inform the government department’s own efforts at advising reform.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, white-skinned and gray-haired at 78, counts this past academic year as his 47th year on the faculty at Harvard. The acclaimed scholar is emblematic of the “Old Harvard” image of the faculty—predominantly aging and white.
But administrators say that this model should no longer be the mainstay of modern academia. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences—which consists of nearly half of the Harvard’s faculty—has devoted itself to establishing the young, dynamic, multicultural faculty of the future.
But after undergoing a phase of dramatic expansion in the faculty in the first part of the decade, FAS has found itself confronted with the task of budgetary streamlining—thereby restricting the school’s ability to recruit fresh faces and personalities to the faculty.
With recent budget cuts restricting the number of searches authorized across FAS, the school has had to rethink its approach to fostering Harvard’s future faculty—such as a one-time retirement package for older faculty members and a mentorship program for younger faculty.
THE DIFFICULTIES OF EXPANSION
Last academic year, securing a professorship at Harvard was close to impossible. Only nine professors joined the ranks of FAS, as Dean Michael D. Smith had imposed a near-complete freeze on faculty hiring in a bleak fiscal climate.
The stringent hiring trend posed a stark contrast to the tremendous prosperity of the preceding years: in the decade prior to the financial crisis, the professoriate grew by roughly 20 percent—from 589 to 712 individuals—and plans were in place to hire as many as 750.
“We were in an extraordinary position of both having the will, planning, and capacity for growth in the first half of this decade,” says History Professor William C. Kirby, who oversaw much of the expansion as FAS dean from 2002 to 2006.
But all that has changed. As multi-year searches are finalized, Smith says he expects a slight growth in the coming year. But next year’s size may well be the ceiling—Smith has projected a shrinking of the faculty as departures outpace the number of searches.
With the dearth of new hires, Smith faces dampened prospects for dramatically reshaping the faculty, a goal that had extended across much of the decade.
In 2005, coming off of former University President Lawrence H. Summers’s claim that “innate differences” between the sexes could help to explain the lack of female scientists at elite institutions, Harvard reaffirmed its commitment to increasing the number of women and minority faculty members.
But five years later, even through a decade of expansion, the proportions of women and minorities in the faculty as compared with their white male colleagues have changed only slightly. Today, a quarter of the University faculty are women and 17 percent are minorities, according to the 2009 annual report of the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity.
“Reshaping a talented and well-established faculty is a long-term commitment,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote to the community in March, “and much work remains to be done.”
MAKING ROOM FOR NEWCOMERS
Despite the challenges confronting FAS’ desire to diversify the face of the faculty, the school has boldly signalled its commitment to the mission over the past year.
In Dec. 2009, Smith announced a one-time faculty retirement plan that invited professors aged 65 and over who have served at least 10 years at the University to leave their teaching posts within the next four years. Nearly a quarter of the faculty in FAS is eligible for the package.
Discussions about a faculty retirement plan have been in the works for well over a decade, according to former University Provost Jerry R. Green. But the recent implementation of the package comes at an opportune moment for a University in the throes of financial distress.
Not only would the package alleviate budgetary pressure by incentivizing retirement for older professors, it would also create vacancies for younger, lower-salaried hires.
“One sort of feels an obligation to the department one’s working in, as one ages, not to hang around forever,” says Chemistry Professor, Emeritus William Klemperer ’50.
PLANTING THE SEEDS
In further pursuit of integrating younger faculty members into FAS, the school has intensified efforts to retain its junior faculty.
When he arrived on campus in 1961 as an assistant professor, Neurosciences Professor John E. Dowling said that the expectation was that only a handful of the other assistant professors in the field would be awarded tenure at Harvard. Dowling even left for Johns Hopkins University before being invited back to Harvard in 1971.
But times have changed: “When we try to appoint an assistant professor today, it’s more like appointing a senior faculty member,” Dowling says.
In the last five years, the University has moved toward a tenure track process that looks to promote professors from within the community. As a result, FAS chooses its junior faculty under the assumption that they will ride the tenure track through to a full professorship.
Instead of solely focusing on attracting the well-established and accomplished stars of the academy, the University has dedicated itself to taking a risk on young professionals with potential, according to Dowling.
“One good thing about aiming to get younger faculty is that if you bet on the right faculty, you get them at the peak of their productivity,” says Deanna Dalrymple, department administrator of the history of art and architecture department.
Klemperer says that in the past the University has “erred on the side of hiring people who are past their creative period.”
With diminished capability to make hires, Smith has turned to the junior faculty already on campus. Last year, he appointed an expert in inequality, Sociology Professor Michèle Lamont, to assist in the cause.
As senior advisor to the Dean on Faculty Development and Diversity, Lamont has universalized a mentorship program originally targeted at matching female junior faculty with members of the senior faculty.
These more experienced individuals provide their mentees with suggestions on fruitful areas of research to pursue and connections to other  academic heavyweights in the field, shaping the younger individuals to become formidable candidates for tenure at Harvard.
“The hope is that Harvard is able to identify the best junior faculty and really provide them with the resources, environment, and mentorship needed to make them incredibly successful and ultimately senior faculty,” says Natural Sciences Professor Hopi E. Hoekstra.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?
Another area that has fallen under consideration as the University examines the future of its faculty is racial diversity.
Even before FAS’ finances fully stabilize, Lamont says that she has committed herself to increasing diversity within the faculty by expanding the pool of candidates considered for each new appointment.
Traditionally, the University has not placed enough emphasis on seeking out diversity—in categories like gender and ethnicity—in candidates for faculty positions, according to Lamont. Consequently, she adds, the list of contenders for the professoriate have tended toward homogeny.
But a simply homogenous group of individuals does not reflect the best talent—a concept that is seen in Ph.D. classes that “look like the United Nations,” Lamont says.
“If we don’t look broadly and diversely, we are missing the best of the next generation,” she says.
But it remains unclear to what degree FAS will diversify its candidate pool in pursuit of creating the “new faculty.”
According to Dowling, FAS has implemented an unstated policy that resembles affirmative action.
“I think there certainly is affirmative action going on in terms of faculty appointments,” he says. “We certainly encourage departments to seek widely and seek a diverse faculty. There’s no question about this.”
But Mansfield—who writes about the merits of executive authority and has already voiced concerns about Harvard’s liberal tendencies—says that he does not see the need for any form of affirmative action when it comes to the selection of faculty members.
“I don’t think that there is any prejudice against having blacks on our faculty or against having women, so now I think to renew the campaign for diversity is like kicking an open door,” says Mansfield, who decided not to take the faculty retirement package.
“I think they’ve gone far enough on diversity,” he adds. “It is unnecessary and superfluous and could be harmful because any time that you pick a goal other than excellence you subtract from excellence. You distract yourself from keeping the best faculty in the world.”
NOT GLORIFIED POST-DOCS
Hoekstra exemplifies the “new Harvard.” Raised within Harvard’s tenure-track system after arriving from the University of California, Santa Barbara, 37-year-old Hoekstra was promoted to the senior faculty this year.
The natural sciences is an example of a field with traditionally low female representation—and it has been making concerted efforts to ensure that female faculty stay on track to become full-fledged professors.
While only 12 percent of the natural science senior faculty Hokestra entered is comprised of women, her ascension to the top of the tenure ladder shows that female academics—once marginalized—are now beginning to balance the gender skew.
Women comprise almost a third of the junior faculty in the natural sciences—a promising figure that stands to increase the number of female senior faculty members in the future.
Indeed, Hoekstra says that the department of organismic and evolutionary biology has brought in six female junior faculty members in recent years, all the while emphasizing the tenure track system and the gradual integration into a welcoming community of academics at Harvard.
In addition to FAS-wide mentoring services, OEB offers programs encouraging a sense of community—programs that Hoekstra contrasts to what, before the mentorship programs, might have felt more like a “glorified post-docs” that prepare their resumes for positions elsewhere.
Hoekstra acknowledges that hiring reductions may hamper the changes the University wishes to institute in its faculty, but she holds out hope for an eventual new face of the faculty.
“Certainly it will bring in fewer young people,” she says. “But the hope is that all changes, right?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crippled by mass layoffs last summer, the Harvard Union of Clerical Technical Workers enters this year’s round of contract negotiations with squared shoulders.
Last year was worse than staff had imagined—275 employees lost their jobs, 100 of whom were HUCTW members.
The painful memories have not yet subsided, but Harvard staff are confident in improved labor relations, believing that the University’s financial situation has now stabilized.
By June 10, the union expects to reach an agreement on what will likely be a three-year contract, possibly more inclusive than in previous years.
Though the economic climate is still uncertain—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has yet to close a budget deficit of at least $35 million—the union is not only pushing hard to mitigate the impact of possible budget cuts but also exploring the potential for a salary raise.
“It will be a year since members of our union have seen any kind of salary increase, and so that subject gets a lot of urgent attention,” HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger says.
LEARNING FROM HARD TIMES
Last year’s layoffs weren’t exactly unexpected. But many staffers say they were caught off guard when the layoffs struck their ranks.
“I remember thinking ‘Oh my God, this isn’t happening to me,’” says one Harvard employee who was laid off her first week on the job last spring and who wished to remain anonymous.
“I actually was pretty surprised last year with the number of layoffs that happened, and that was disappointing,” says Laura M. Johnson, a history department staff assistant who has worked at Harvard for 25 years. “I didn’t really see it coming. It was pretty shocking to me.”
Though Jaeger says he does not expect another round of cuts on the same scale, the union is taking measures to ensure that layoffs do not happen as abruptly and do not impact workers as adversely as last year.
“It’s a really rough generalization, and it’s a mix of things that happened last year in terms of layoffs, but we were overall maybe 70 percent satisfied by our union and management efforts to save jobs and to keep people working at Harvard if they were laid off,” Jaeger says. “We want to try to find ways to change policies and strengthen programs to make that number even higher.”
One of HUCTW’s primary concerns is to give their members a more prominent voice in the decision-making process of their divisions.
According to Article I of the current HUCTW contract with the University, union workers have the right to be part of “joint councils” that make planning decisions in the workplace.
“Our members are saying in a clear loud way, ‘We want to be involved. We want to be heard. We want to help find the right solutions,’” Jaeger says.
THE TIMES, THEY ARE A CHANGIN’
Many of the union’s concerns relate to by-products of last year’s economic crisis and the subsequent layoffs.
Slashing the workforce has also taken a toll on the remaining employees, Jaeger says, since they must take on additional responsibilities to make up for fewer staff. HUCTW officials found that more than 60 percent of respondents to an internal survey said they had seen an increased workload in the past year due to cuts.
“A lot of departments are trying to figure out how to function in an excellent way with reduced staffing levels, and there’s a lot of rethinking and tinkering going on with schedules and job descriptions, and interface with technology and all of those work systems,” Jaeger says.
The union is also looking to expand—a longtime goal that has been renewed when laid-off HUCTW members were given priority in finding new jobs at Harvard last year.
Jaeger says that both the University and its employees have realized that union membership comes with tangible benefits, and as a result, employees “around the edges” who perform clerical or technical tasks but are not members of HUCTW have felt marginalized.
But the negotiations are likely to leave key issues unresolved, given the size and diversity of the University. While Murphy says that the University and the union are looking at the terms of joint councils, he says he does not think that the new contract will solve workload problems arising from a staff shortage.
“That wouldn’t be involved in this negotiation. That would be something that we would have to continue to look at.” University Director of Labor Relations Bill Murphy says, adding that all faculty, administrators and staff have had to adjust their workloads over the past years, and that union leaders participated in impact bargaining to adjust workload around every HUCTW position impacted.
And as in all labor negotiations, wages remain a pressing concern.
“Our negotiating challenge is to figure out together what are the appropriate ways to reward the staff and to honor the contribution that the staff have made and are making everyday, and that’s never an easy set of questions, even in more prosperous times,” Jaeger says.
While Jaeger acknowledges strained economic conditions, he also says he believes that there are clear indicators of the University’s improving financial situation.
“There are a lot of very good signs,” Jaeger says. “We’re hoping that in a number of areas in the next year we’re going to be moving closer and closer to a calm, confident, healthy, growing University.”
Murphy, however, speaks with more equanimity.
“We’re still in a time of constrained resources,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few people in the world understand Scottish Gaelic. Even fewer enrolled in Celtic 131, “Intermediate Scottish Gaelic” at Harvard this past semester.
And yet the course was offered—an indication of how the University, even in the midst of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, has reaffirmed its commitment to its smaller departments.
Small departments, as the name suggests, serve a relatively small portion of the Harvard student body. In 2008, five undergraduates concentrated in Germanic languages and literatures, five in Sanskrit and Indian studies, and nine in Slavic languages and literatures.
Despite their sizes, such departments entail substantive costs: faculty and staff salaries, office space and supplies, and administrative support. Every dollar spent toward small departments is a dollar not spent elsewhere within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—or toward fields that draw far more students.
In flush times, the luxury of garnishing smaller departments is just another reminder of Harvard’s reach and wealth—the trappings of a mighty endowment. But recent fiscal constraints have forced the University to sharpen its priorities and, consequently, devote greater attention to where cuts—not additions—can be made.
In this environment, the budgeting process for small departments, formerly almost a matter of course—is far less certain.
“Universities cannot cover everything—we cannot teach all the languages of the world here,” says Classics Professor Jan M. Ziolkowski. “We have to make choices.”
SMALL ENOUGH TO DISAPPEAR?
As the former head of the classics, comparative literature, folklore and mythology, and medieval studies programs, and a former member of the Celtic languages and literatures department, Ziolkowski is no stranger to the smaller humanities disciplines. He currently directs the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in D.C., which dedicates itself to such specialties as Byzantine, garden and landscape, and pre-Columbian studies.
With a resume like this, Ziolkowski is familiar with reconciling the specialized academic focuses of smaller departments with their financial realities.
“I would think of...the inefficiency,” he says. “You would think, this department has only one concentrator every two years and two grad students. And then you add up the grad student stipends, multiply by five years, and you ask yourself, ‘Why should we be doing this? Why do we need the small departments?’”
These questions became particularly relevant during last spring’s budgetary frenzy, when units across FAS found themselves re-examining their expenditures—ranging from cookies to staffing—and University Hall found itself searching for ways to rationalize the existence of separate units.
“We looked at all kinds of options for us when we began this process,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith says when asked if the administration had ever considered merging or scaling back smaller departments.
Such considerations arose in the minds of worried faculty members who recognized that sprawling departments like Economics possess a distinct advantage over smaller units when making their cases for funding.
For example, Slavic Languages and Literatures currently lists 20 faculty on its website. It had only nine concentrators in 2008. In stark contrast, Economics had a student-faculty ratio of 20 to 1 in 2006, and resorted to cancelling its junior seminars because of a dearth of staffing.
“There always has been pressure for departments that have a large influx of students to have more faculty,” says Wilt Idema, chair of East Asian languages and civilizations, which had 40 concentrators in 2008. “If I were the chair of economics, I would push my dean to have more faculty.”
Since faculty salaries are a considerable investment for FAS, the likes of the Celtic department have less recourse for claiming the additional dollar if budgetary streamlining is driven purely by efficiency and practicality.
VALIDATING THEIR EXISTENCE
Harvard, some argue, should not base its course and program offerings on the areas that students decide to frequent. “We shouldn’t choose [what to offer] simply by relevance or by popularity or by modernity or by what’s trendy,” Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield says.
For now, the University is falling into line, standing by its smaller departments even amid high fiscal pressures.
“Just because a department has a small number of faculty or small number of concentrators taking their courses—that’s not a good reason for getting rid of it,” Smith says. “Take something like Sanskrit—it might be small on campus but India is huge.”
The cuts to smaller departments have been proportional to those of larger departments—to the tune of 15 percent in the fiscal year that ends this coming June.
“We serve many constituencies in both graduates and undergraduates,” Slavic Languages and Literatures Chair Julie Buckler says. “We feel that the University continues to support us robustly in that.”
As Smith says, “It was not high on my list to go cutting activities out of the FAS that have been fundamental to what we’ve been doing and have been wonderful on campus.”
WHAT IS PRAGMATIC?
Departments that have the fewest concentrators tend to teach subject areas that have more oblique connections to current affairs and fewer obvious paths to the job market.
In an opinion piece published in The New York Times, University President Drew G. Faust wrote that in the face of pressure toward preprofessional undergraduate educations, “we should remember that colleges and universities are about a great deal more than measurable utility.”
In deciding to support the smaller departments at Harvard—both financially and intellectually—Faust and Smith have been bucking the national trend by defying what Ziolkowski refers to as “American pragmatism”—the emphasis on studying subjects relevant to one’s immediate environment.
Some administrators and professors argue that there is distinct value to teaching courses not in step with current trends for the sake of preserving knowledge and perpetuating intellectual thirst.
“Let’s say that you take care of crisis in the Mideast and that you cure tuberculosis,” Ziolkowski says. “You still have to make life worth living and enjoying for people. And that’s where the humanities come in...things that will bring us solace, bring us self-knowledge, increase our understanding of others as well.”
As Mansfield says, “A university is not an institution that is directed toward practice but is meant to cherish the life of the mind.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the most competitive year for humanities graduate students entering the field of academia since the Modern Language Association began tracking academic job trends 35 years ago, some administrators maintain that students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are an anomaly to the grim national picture.
On the national scale, the number of available positions in the field of English, for instance, has dropped 35 percent from last year. Similarly, those in foreign languages have dropped 39 percent, according to the MLA.
The American Historical Association and Economic Association have both reported substantial drops in their respective disciplines, with the number of available history jobs the lowest in a decade.
“For this year, yes, there are many, many fewer jobs,” says W. James Simpson, the English Department’s director of graduate studies. “But our students got them.”
Of the 10 English students Simpson says were “seriously” on the job market, seven received tenure-track positions at “really prestigious institutions,” and one received a fellowship at the Harvard Humanities Center. But two individuals were unsuccessful in their job searches.
History Department Chair Lizabeth Cohen says that graduate students in her department, too, did “incredibly well” this year, despite the tough job market. Many students were able to procure tenure-track jobs, postdoctoral fellowships, and short-term visiting lectureships, according to Cohen.
Simpson speculates that the success of so many English graduate students this year was likely due to the department’s structure as a “vocational program” that produces not only “technically competent scholars” but also employable candidates with desirable characteristics.
PRODUCING DESIRABLE CANDIDATES
In a bleak fiscal climate, various graduate humanities programs at Harvard provide students career-counseling services while they also bolster their students’ academic interests.
Simpson says that the English department’s job placement seminar—which affords students the chance to participate in mock interviews—“maximizes” the possibility of them finding a job.
And although 10 history Ph.D. students were offered tenure-track positions at various universities, Cohen says that the history department has used what “limited budget we got from University Hall” to hire its own students, “to help them survive in these difficult times.”
Cohen also credited the University’s new College Fellow Program—instituted this past year—with providing several students with a means of support for the coming year.
The program, which recruited 21 Ph.D.s for a one-year teaching and research fellowship, was initially conceived as a cost-cutting mechanism. Since the hiring slowdown limited the number of new lecturers FAS could hire last year, the new program provided a much cheaper alternative.
Some administrators, however, consider the College Fellow Program to be more than a mere economic solution to the hiring slowdown. For some, the initiative also provides former graduate students the rare opportunity to spend a year developing their teaching skills, thereby making them more competitive in the job market.
“I love solutions that solve multiple problems at the same time,” says FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
“We’re continuing to graduate outstanding Ph.D. students who would love to go on to an academic career, but the market is not very strong for them,” he says. “Should we just have them flipping burgers or should we have them here helping out on campus where we have actual needs?”
Eight of this year’s 21 fellows have received tenure-track positions at other universities, according to FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser, who oversees the program. Seven others have been reappointed for the 2010-2011 academic year.
Nathanael Andrade—who specializes in ancient history—is one of the eight current college fellows who received a tenure-track position for next year. Andrade, who will work at West Virginia University in the fall, says that his time as a fellow this past year made him “a more marketable candidate from the perspective of search committees,” as he was able to design his own syllabi and teach his own courses—two experiences many graduate students never have before applying for jobs.
Tomoko L. Kitagawa, a college fellow in the field of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, adds that the experience of having created the two courses she taught this year puts her a step ahead of the other graduate students with whom she will eventually compete for tenure-track positions.
“It’s like departing from the graduate school mentality where everything is given,” she says. “Now I’m contributing something.”
But Kitagawa also notes that while being a college fellow was a “good experience,” the program was “just established a year ago, so not too many institutions recognize what I did.”
AN ANOMALY?
But not every graduate student is convinced that this year’s reported success exempts Harvard students from a national trend.
“Last year was pretty bad, from what I know,” says Steven P. Rozenski, a graduate student interested in medieval religious literature. “I’m glad I have a couple of years to go, though.”
According to William Pannapacker, a Harvard English graduate student in the 1990s and a contributor to The Chronicle of Higher Education, one year of success is not enough evidence to ignore the gravity of the “academic labor market.”
In fact, the full effect of the economic crisis on academia has yet to be seen: it could either rebound or the decline in traditional academic jobs may continue and never recover, he says.
He adds that he hopes his alma mater will prepare its graduate students for the opportunities that will exist in the future rather than continuing to fixate on “familiar positions” that will probably decline than in the coming decades.
“It seems clear that the old system in which the tenure-track position was the standard expectation will have to be replaced by a range of other options,” he says. “Even Harvard will have to face that reality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July 2008, University President Drew G. Faust declared her intention to bring Harvard to the forefront of a global sustainability push.
Her commitment was twofold—reduce Harvard’s own greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2006 baseline levels within the next decade and peg sustainability as a research and teaching priority.
But two years later, the once-heralded banners emblazoned with “Green is the New Crimson” now go unnoticed in Harvard Yard, and faculty and students worry that Harvard’s efforts thus far will only have a limited impact in leading the fight against climate change.
As of this April, Harvard had reduced its emissions to 7 percent below 2006 levels, well on its way to the 30 percent goal.
But due to varying starting points and resource constraints, Harvard has seen uneven progress across its schools, with Harvard Business School boasting a 27 percent reduction and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences reporting a 1 percent growth in emissions.
At the same time, environmental leaders on campus have expressed concerns that the University has not reached its potential as a top research institution in encouraging sustainability around the world, given that Harvard’s efforts can serve as a symbolic call to action.
“We’ve taken some steps within our physical infrastructure to lead by example,” says Craig S. Altemose, a member of the Greenhouse Gas Task Force that drafted Harvard’s sustainability goals. “But in terms of really teaching our students what is at stake with climate and giving them the tools they need to survive in that world, we’re not doing enough.”
A LIMITED PLAN
Beyond Harvard’s efforts to green its own campus, several faculty members and students argue that the University’s role in fostering a life-long commitment to sustainability among Harvard students will have a more far-reaching impact than reducing greenhouse gas emissions in labs and offices.
“We can make greater contributions to dealing with these problems by education rather than worrying about our own emissions,” says Harvard School of Public Health professor James K. Hammitt ’78. “We have all these students coming through, if they learn certain habits that could have a pretty big effect through their lifetime, they could make an influence throughout their lives.”
Given Harvard’s position as a leading academic institution with a global reach, Altemose adds that Harvard should focus on its larger sustainability research and policy initiatives.
“I don’t think anyone thinks of Harvard as a place with buildings and facilities,” says Altemose, who is a joint student at Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School. “They think of it as a place for learning and ideas.”
Already, Harvard has seen the growth of several programs designed to encourage sustainability research.
“We educate individuals for environmental leadership at every level and have faculty involved in a wide range of related research in schools across the university,” Faust says.
For example, faculty and students at the Harvard Graduate School of Design have experimented with methods of green roof retrofitting on their own building, Gund Hall. The Law School and Kennedy School each boast green academic programs, such as an environmental law clinic and a sustainability science program.
And several Harvard professors—such as Kennedy School professor John P. Holdren, now President Barack Obama’s science advisor—have already been recruited to shape American energy policy.
“What we actually do on our campus has just a small impact,” says environmental science and engineering professor Daniel P. Schrag, who is also the director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment. “The real impact we have is our impact on our students, who go on to become leaders in businesses and government.”
DIFFERENT PRISMS
Ultimately, Harvard’s campus sustainability efforts will serve more as a symbolic declaration of the University’s commitment than as a practical contribution in addressing climate change, Schrag says.
But he adds that critics of Harvard’s sustainability efforts acknowledge that Harvard must back up its dedication to environmental research and policy with action on campus.
“It’s exactly what Harvard should do because we should be leading people through practice,” Schrag says.
Harvard’s central Office for Sustainability—created in 2008 to coordinate campus sustainability efforts—has been tasked with helping each school meet Faust’s 30 percent goal, but the schools’ individual needs and resources limitations have resulted in varying degrees of progress.
“The Business School would just have to change a setting on a pump to make it more efficient,” Law School’s facilities management director John Arciprete says regarding the difficulties of greening the 1950s-era Law School buildings. “We would have to buy a whole new pump.”
For FAS, the addition of five new buildings since 2006, which included energy-intensive lab space, account for half its utilities costs and increased its greenhouse gas emissions by one percent, according to FAS Director of Operations Jay M. Phillips.
And diverging financial constraints at each school limit green renovation or costly sustainability efforts.
For example, the Graduate School of Design, which receives 41 percent of its revenue from endowment income, has had to dramatically cut back on planned renovations—such as replacing the large windows in the studio area of Gund Hall—after this year’s endowment payout declined by 8 percent from the previous year, according to W. Kevin Cahill, the school’s facilities manager.
“We’re realizing you don’t try to squeeze everybody through the same prism,” says Harvard Business School Professor Robert Steven Kaplan, who chairs the Office for Sustainability’s executive committee. “Everybody had to get sensitized to what can and can’t get done.”
Despite the challenges some of the schools currently face, OFS Director Heather A. Henriksen says she remains confident that the University will reach its 30 percent reduction goal by 2016.
But the larger question is not whether the University will meet its 2016 target levels of greenhouse gas emissions, but whether Harvard will be able to continue to push sustainability as a global priority and lead by example.
OFS’ own approach to targeting a 30 percent reduction in emission levels can serve as a model for other schools and businesses, Kaplan says.
“It’s an aggressive goal that we may not meet, but it’s wonderful to try,” Schrag says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Election season was in full swing, and students at Harvard and across the nation were passionately supporting a youthful candidate for president who spoke to them with eloquence and charisma, and who even carried a Harvard degree. Cambridge hosted heated debates, partisan speakers, and plenty of student volunteers distributing leaflets and voter registration information. Issues ranging from the candidates’ stances on national security to levels of political experience were discussed in classrooms and common rooms across campus.
Many current Harvard students might recognize this scene from 2008. But to students from an earlier era, these images conjure up memories of another campaign—the presidential election of 1960, when John F. Kennedy ’40 ran for president against Richard M. Nixon.
HARVARD FOR KENNEDY
According to polls taken by The Crimson in 1960, students and faculty leaned heavily in favor of Kennedy.
“He was young; he was charismatic. It looked like a new frontier,” said former Crimson editor Peter S. Britell ’63, echoing Kennedy’s campaign theme. “It was very, very inspirational.”
Among undergraduate and graduate really identified with the Kennedy campaign, even those who weren’t actively involved.”
At this point, many of those young people could not yet vote—the voting age wouldn’t be lowered from 21 to 18 for another ten years—but excitement still ran high among many non-voting students. Some sported buttons reading “If I Were 21, I’d Vote for Kennedy.”
Kennedy’s ties to the College also endeared him to Harvard students.
“It was not unusual in 1958 and 1960 to see his brother and mother and sister all over Harvard,” Smith said.
Just six days before the election, Kennedy—who served on the Crimson business board and swam on the varsity swim team during his undergraduate years—spoke via telephone connection from California to an overflowing crowd in Sanders Theater.
“You’re the only audience in the United States that can understand my accent,” he jested to the enthusiastic students.
CAMPUS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL
Many students took action on their preference for one candidate or the other by volunteering for one of the campaigns.
Members of the Young Republicans handed out leaflets supporting Nixon in a local supermarket; the Harvard Young Democratic Club distributed flyers in the subway.
Supporters of both parties picketed polls to persuade undecided voters at the last minute, and a voter registration drive sought to sign students up to vote via absentee ballot in their home states.
“In 1960...the action was on the Democratic side,” recalled Congressman Thomas E. Petri ’62, though he was involved in the Young Republicans and Students for Nixon.
But many alumni from the Republican side also remember campaigning vigorously.
“We organized meetings and held rallies and wrote articles,” said Howard Phillips, who participated in Republican organizations at Harvard and on the national scene as a student, and has since run for president three times himself as a third-party candidate.
Student campaigning stretched beyond Cambridge, too.
The Crimson reported at the time that the Young Democrats took the unprecedented step of taking “complete charge of the campaign in the four precincts adjacent to the University.”
Phillips and three fellow Harvard students went even farther afield—they took a cross-country polling trip in the summer of 1959, assessing the strength of the candidates in 17 different cities before presenting the results of their work—which predicted that Nixon would win “overwhelmingly”—to Nixon at the national Young Republican convention in Denver.
Christopher T. Bayley ’60, who served as president of the Young Republicans at Harvard, said that groups of about 25 students would make trips to New Hampshire on weekends, ringing doorbells to drum up votes in the upcoming Republican primary for either Nixon or his opponent Nelson A. Rockefeller.
Despite his own Republican leanings, Bayley acknowledged that Kennedy generated much more excitement among his fellow students. “Very few people were emotionally enthusiastic about Nixon,” he admitted.
Many alumni recalled a particularly colorful incident which elicited high emotions from both sides. In the spring of 1960, students said, Adlai E. Stevenson—then a potential Democratic nominee—remarked that the U.S. should apologize for the presence of an American U-2 spy plane which had been shot down by the Soviet Union.
The Young Republicans staged a march to the post office on Mount Auburn Street, where they planned to mail Stevenson an umbrella, a symbol recalling Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of the Germans at Munich.
The Democrats organized what Congressman Barney Frank ’61, a member of the Students for Stevenson group, called “a counterpicket.”
Some alumni recalled that the Democrats mailed President Eisenhower a pair of suspenders because, as Petri put it, they thought that “the country had been caught with its pants down.”
Four students and two passersby were arrested for disturbing the peace during the demonstrations. The students, who returned to their dining halls that night, were met with raucous approval, The Crimson reported at the time.
“Oddly, there was great solidarity between the Young Republicans and the Young Democrats,” said Bruce K. Chapman ’62, then head of Students for Rockefeller, about the aftermath of the arrests. “They were all against the police.”
“Honestly, I think there was more openness to competition, even though an overwhelming number of the students as well the faculty were for John Kennedy,” Chapman said. “There was geniality about the election and a pretty serious respect for both sides.”
ENGAGED TO BE LED
Despite the drama of arrests in the Square, some said that engagement in politics among the student body as a whole was not very deep.
“The campus was considerably less politicized than it is now,” said Britell, who reported on the campaign. “Students didn’t necessarily have strong political viewpoints or have a long list of policy issues that they cared about. They liked [Kennedy] because he was a charismatic figure and he was a shining light.”
The preceding decade had not been one of student activism anywhere in the country, some alumni remembered. In the aftermath of trauma of World War II, many said that the country turned away from politics.
“It was a period of re-adjustment,” Britell said. “It was a period of peace also. Apart from the Cold War, which tended to be more academic than really hit home, people went about their lives.”
The students who were on campus at this time mirrored the rest of the country in this lack of political engagement.
“I would say that the Class of 1960 was more in the relaxed period of the ’50s,” Smith said.
“Looking back on it now, I’m embarrassed and regretful at how removed from it all we were in many ways,” remarked Frederic L. Ballard, Jr. ’63, who also helped cover the campaign for The Crimson. “I wish the temper of the times, I wish the academic culture of the time had been to be more connected with the real world.”
Some alumni said that the faculty were far more interested in the campaign than students were. Several faculty members, including Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences McGeorge Bundy and Professors Arthur M. Schlesinger and John Kenneth Galbraith, went on to join Kennedy’s administration.
“There was more activity among the faculty,” concurred Frank. “I don’t remember a lot of student activity.”
Meanwhile, when Radcliffe students gathered to watch the first debate between Kennedy and Nixon—the first televised presidential debate in history, which is remembered as a seminal moment in which Kennedy displayed his confident, well-spoken demeanor to the nation—the Radcliffe students were not impressed.
According to a Crimson article about the event, several students fell asleep, and one said she would have rather been playing bridge. The writer, Jonathan R. Walton ’63, blamed the low enthusiasm on the fact that “both candidates lack any real flair as speakers.”
“Perhaps the candidates weren’t distinctive enough, or the issues weren’t great enough, or the drama of impending crisis was missing,” Walton wrote.
Yet for the students who did immerse themselves in politics, the 1960 election provided plenty of drama—and in some cases catalyzed a lifetime of political involvement.
Recalling Senator Joseph R. McCarthy’s charges of communism in the government, the Brown v. Board of Education decision and its aftermath, and the widespread fear of a nuclear attack, former Crimson editor Mark H. Alcott ’61 said that the era does not deserve its placid reputation.
“You put that all together and there was a lot of ferment in this period,” he said. “In any case, I think much of that did center on the 1960 election.”
Smith said he agrees that this election made a powerful impact on the youth of the age: “As [Kennedy] said, the torch had been passed to a new generation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a call for unity.
Faced with the largest financial crisis in recent history, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has enhanced the rhetoric of shared priorities across the traditionally decentralized school. FAS’ path to recovery, Smith says, will require staunch commitment to a “core mission.”
But even as Smith successfully trims a daunting budget deficit, his approach has struck a nervous chord among faculty members who benefit from the incongruent academic and spending methods of the school. Led by affiliates of some of the traditionally independent FAS centers, they have voiced concerns that an overarching financial mission could intrude into their own academic priorities.
But in establishing a series of financial priorities—centered around student instruction and faculty research—Smith expects the many and varied stakeholders of the school to fall into line.
“We as a Faculty must apply our resources, both financial capital and human capital, to the pursuit of our core mission first and foremost,” Smith wrote in a letter to the Faculty in February.
“This is an affirmation of what we all know to be true,” he wrote.
THREATENING THE CROWN JEWELS
In FAS, decentralization is epitomized by a spate of centers and institutes. Developed across the school in the last 50 years, these hubs, many of them interdisciplinary, are composed of faculty members and affiliates with shared interests and the funds to act on them—distinct from degree-granting academic departments that focus on student instruction in the classroom.
In a time of increased efforts at centralization, the quasi-independent and often self-generated and self-governed nature of the centers affords them a unique place in the University.
Harvard’s traditional “bottom-up” structure—in which the “very, very best ideas” are produced by the Faculty and gain broader administrative support—is the source of the University’s “great genius,” says former FAS Dean William C. Kirby.
“It’s the capacity for good ideas to come from the Faculty and gain the support of deans,” says Kirby, who left his position as dean to head the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies in 2006. “It encourages what you might call the best kind of academic entrepreneurialism.”
“The centers are the jewels in the crown,” says Anthropology Professor Arthur M. Kleinman, who heads the Harvard University Asia Center, of the centers’ relationship to the University.
“We have faculty who are very entrepreneurial, who are incredibly imaginative and effective in doing things, and the University has always encouraged that,” Kleinman adds. “We don’t want to see that change.”
THE VOICING OF ANXIETY
At a Faculty meeting on March 2, professors went public with their angst about the centralized priorities for FAS.
“What we see happening here is a very fundamental shift in the governance, the autonomy of the centers,” said David G. Blackbourn, director of the Minda de Gunzberg Center for European Studies, to Smith. “What, sir, it seems you are asking now is to take control.”
Blackbourn joined a series of professors affiliated with area-study centers—whose academic goals are focused on a particular region—who approached the microphone to address Smith and the faculty members who were present.
But the professors took issue with a priority-driven approach that has gained support from the highest rungs of the University.
Sitting at the front of the room, University President Drew G. Faust came to Smith’s defense: “I would hope that no unit would want to be immune to that kind of questioning and priority setting,” she said.
Indeed, the public concern opened a two-way debate, even among center affiliates. Government Professor Daniel Carpenter, director of the Center for American Political Studies, said at the time that his center’s priorities—largely focused on student research funding—were aligned with FAS priorities.
The new policy will push centers to “not just be a faculty bastion, a little enclave away from the University,” he said.
SETTING PRIORITIES
With the financial crisis on his shoulders, Smith set in motion the once-sluggish wheels of change at Harvard.
Facing a monumental $220 million budget deficit in the wake of a 30 percent drop in the endowment at the end of 2008, Smith began a multi-year plan to find additional funds and cut back in certain areas, asking units to surrender some of their institutional independence in service of a common financial goal.
Wielding the power of the purse, Smith has sought to channel spending and reconcile a “disconnect” between academic and budgetary planning that he described in last year’s Dean’s report.
His focus on core priorities dates back to the summer of 2008, when FAS established a commitment to what the FAS Planning website broadly labels “essential curricular needs, intellectual priorities that will strengthen departments and centers, and interdisciplinary collaboration.”
Like Smith’s rhetoric, the actual identity of these so-called “core priorities” have been vague, and budgetary decisions are being fleshed out in direct coordination between the administration and individuals units.
Department and center administrators say they have spent many additional hours under scrutiny from the FAS budget office as the two sides come to a consensus on expenditure priorities—a decision on which FAS has final say.
“There will be more central planning,” says History of Art and Architecture Professor Robin E. Kelsey, who serves on the Faculty Council, the highest governing board of FAS. “The different parts of FAS will need to justify their activities with respect to the core mission of the school.”
“I haven’t seen it as micromanaging,” says History of Art and Architecture Department Administrator Deanna Dalrymple. “I’ve seen it as survival.”
A FINANCIAL GOAL
Facing at least a $35 million deficit, the FAS budget office communicated the new budgeting approach to the community in the month leading to the March Faculty meeting. The policy required affiliated FAS units—including centers—to fall into line and justify that all their expenditures serve core FAS priorities.
In the past, certain centers had exercised a great deal of autonomy in spending funds allocated by donors towards their fields. But with his fresh emphasis on the “core priorities” of FAS, Smith was now essentially prescribing the areas in which units ought to spend.
While Smith has made it clear that a donor’s intent will be honored, the policy allows FAS central administration the opportunity to target funds efficiently so that some can be redirected from within the confines of a particular center to broader University priorities.
For example, the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute began funding Ukrainian language instruction this academic year—a hefty financial responsibility that had traditionally been upheld by the Slavic Languages Department, says Executive Director Tymish J. Holowinsky.
“We all pitched in together on this because we recognized it was an extraordinary time,” says Kleinman, who noted that his Asia Center had redirected funds away from the faculty research support that the center has previously offered.
Kleinman took part in a series of meetings with the dean and finance officers from FAS as they sought to arrive at a common ground on what contributions were expected of the centers.
“We did come together,” Kleinman says. “And I’m hoping that in the future we will be out of this extraordinary time and we will return to the situation we’ve had in the past, in which the centers had a great deal more leeway and independence.”
SERVING THE CORE MISSION
Centers had been asked to make sacrifices, as they are quick to point out. But they do not represent the only sectors of FAS where personal priorities have been pushed aside as the “core mission” takes priority.
Even department administrators, who are more dependent on unrestricted “subvention” funds from the dean, say that their own wishes do not necessarily align with those expressed by the FAS finance office.
One department administrator in the humanities explained that her own department has been asked to redirect funds for student travel grants to priorities that the FAS financial office has said are more aligned with FAS priorities.
Smith’s office has asked that the department contribute toward graduate student stipends and faculty salaries in the department—costs traditionally covered by unrestricted funds from FAS itself that have enabled the department to focus on more specific academic priorities, such as student travel.
“We really sort of spent the money that we have,” says the administrator, who asked to remain anonymous to preserve her relationship with the administration.
“But if they’re expecting us to sort of pay for more things, that might impact our day-to-day business,” she adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked to define her vision last month, University President Drew G. Faust stopped for a moment.
She looked off into the distance, turning the question over in her head during what was a pregnant pause.
Faust needed to think carefully about her answer. Her predecessor Lawrence H. Summers’ staunch desire to implement his own vision had ultimately led to his downfall.
Up until this point, Faust has tiptoed around the question, preferring to outline abstract principles for how she wants to lead.
Her latest response marks a departure from the previous administration, both in style and substance.
“I think the word ‘vision’ is misleading because it suggests something that I dream and then impose as my vision for Harvard,” Faust says. “I believe that Harvard has purposes that are not something that I impose on the University as particular to me, but rather are shared values, priorities, and goals that I help define, articulate, and work to advance.”
Faust’s presidency to this point has been largely reactive, defined in the past year by the University’s collective response to the financial crisis.
Formerly a low-profile dean of a Faculty most heavily dependent on endowment income, Faust had barely settled into Mass. Hall before she was confronted by the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Painful budget cuts following a precipitous drop in Harvard’s endowment left only her highest priorities intact, providing clues as to the University she envisions. Financial aid, for example, remained untouched by the University’s fiscal magicking.
But Faust, as she herself has said, has many years ahead of her to set a vision that will likely not be limited by a shrinking endowment, but directed by the themes she wants to push.
As the economy stands on the cusp of a recovery, the University must decide how it will situate itself in a changed financial landscape, one much different from the boom years of the early 2000s.
When the endowment rebounds, it will not have been Faust alone who has imposed an agenda. Committees, discussion, and careful consideration are the watch-words of this administration.
As is the phrase, “One University,” meaning an inter-disciplinary approach to solving the world’s problems like health and poverty.
But exactly what this means for Harvard remains shrouded in uncertainty, and for now, Faust hesitates to discuss a more concrete set of plans—especially in Allston.
PRESIDENTIAL CHOICES
Stepping into her new role, Faust quickly charmed the faculty with her mild-mannered presence, her gentle quips, and her thoughtful demeanor.
Her first year on the job was everything the end of the Summers’ presidency was not—a lack of discord and uncontroversial priorities.
In her three-year tenure, Faust’s most direct exercise of presidential power may have been the appointment of seven deans across the University.
According to Herman “Dutch” B. Leonard ’74, who holds a dual appointment at Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School and served on the search committee that recently selected the new Business School Dean, Faust made a deliberate effort to choose candidates committed to collaboration across schools and departments.
The question on her mind, he says, was “How will this potential candidate operate in a university environment?”
Martha L. Minow’s appointment as dean of Harvard Law School last year is emblematic of Faust’s desire to integrate the different parts of the University. Minow—whose own scholarly output has garnered praise for pulling from a variety of fields of study—oversaw the reform of the Law School curriculum towards a more interdisciplinary model.
“I think the key thing for the president is that they end up spending a lot of time recruiting staff and deans, and she has done a lot in that score by picking the academic leadership that has the spirit and style that she has,” says Michael F. Cronin ’75, a former member of the Board of Overseers.
A DREAM DEFERRED
The Allston Science Complex would have been a mecca of interdisciplinary work, giving Faust a chance to bring together her new team to embark on the largest cross-faculty initiative under her direction.
Now, instead of continuing construction on the massive building that would have brought scientists from different fields to work under the same roof, the University has been forced to pause construction indefinitely and instead plant shrubbery to appease residents who complained that the unfinished Science Complex was an eyesore.
With University resources strained, planners have had to return to the drawing board, and the timeline for the expansion’s future has been extended.
At this point, University officials say they are no longer wedded to the Allston plans drawn up before the financial crisis—all options are back on the table.
“By anybody’s estimation the endowment is not going to recover in terms of buying power for a number of years, so for that reason alone we have had to rethink at least the pace if not the scope of Allston,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman says. “We really have a lot of rethinking to do.”
Yet the topic of cross-faculty collaboration continues to intrigue Faust, who becomes noticeably excited when discussing the possibilities for breakthroughs when researchers work together.
Faust recently opened an imaging center where scientists working next to each other use state-of-the-art microscopes to examine samples.
“What scientists say to me is that they find that as they sit there working with these microscopes they turn to the person at the next microscope and say, ‘Look what I found!’ and that person weighs in with an opinion,” she says. “If they weren’t adjacent, that conversation, that spark of insight would never have happened.”
Co-development with other universities, private entities, or non-profits has emerged as a possible solution for lessening the financial burden of building a re-imagined Allston campus.
But uncertainty hangs over this effort as well.
Though co-development might overcome obstacles currently facing the Allston expansion, it is a risky proposition, as a large proportion of such efforts at other universities have failed (see story page 45).
And planners do not appear to be in a hurry to move forward, as the current master plan submitted to the city of Boston will be valid until 2012. Officials have been reluctant to offer a time frame for the planning process or when they think they might resume construction.
Until the University decides how to proceed in Allston, the departments slated to move into the Science Complex in July 2011—the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Medical School’s Department of Systems Biology, and the Wyss Institute for bioengineering—have been left scrambling to find temporary solutions at the school level with little guidance from central administration.
‘ONE UNIVERSITY’
“Every tub on its own bottom”—that’s how the University’s decentralized Faculties have long operated.
Autonomy at the schools has served the University well, but has also resulted in bureaucratic obstacles that hinder efforts to promote cross-Faculty collaboration.
When the central administration needed more office space, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, its subsidiary, sold Mass. Hall. Two years later, in 2008, FAS realized it needed more space for dorms and so rented back part of the structure it once owned—a telling example of the administrative morass that often plagues the University.
To combat the deep-rooted bureaucratic barriers between schools, Faust has designated University-wide themes—human rights, global health, and library reform are a few examples—and established new institutes that serve as magnets, Leonard says, pulling professors together from across disciplines. These provide environments more conducive to faculty collaboration.
Instead of setting individual agendas, Faust has adopted a “bottom-up” governance style, allowing those below her on the administrative hierarchy to take more initiative on specific projects within the context of broader goals.
“Faculty in general don’t respond well to high authority leadership,” Leonard explains. “I think President Faust understands that.”
It’s all part of Faust’s “One University” mantra, says Law School professor John G. Palfrey, Jr. ’94, who taught a graduate seminar under FAS this fall, despite the politics and economics of cross-school teaching that historically hamper such efforts.
Palfrey says he hopes to expand his seminar on online research methods into a General Education course for undergraduates and bring together professors from potentially five other schools to teach.
Palfrey’s efforts are a small example of the interdisciplinary collaboration Faust has encouraged in pursuit of her “One University” mission.
“She wants the University to be a whole greater than the sum of its parts,” Palfrey says.
Earlier this month, Faust appointed Harvard School of Public Health Professor Sue J. Goldie to head the new Harvard Institute for Global Health, a University-wide institute that Faust hopes will spearhead a discipline that she has called a top priority.
“There is a great appetite for more joint activities,” says School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk. “And global health is an enormous vehicle for that.”
Economics professor David M. Cutler ’87 reiterates the importance of tackling the problem from various disciplines.
“Global health spans it all,” says Cutler, who serves on HIGH’s executive committee. Without the collaboration of faculty across schools, “it’s kind of like seeing the world only through one color—you just miss a ton of it.”
FUNDING THE FUTURE
Faust is not one to express a great deal of emotion when speaking about the University’s priorities, other than excitement for the possibilities of academic inquiry.
But mention access to education for the University’s students, and Faust is clearly disappointed—saddened, even.
She has presided over the largest expansion in financial aid in the history of higher education, but Harvard’s graduate students by and large lack access to the generous financial aid packages that undergraduates receive.
“We have a lot more work to do for our graduate and professional students,” she says, with a note of melancholy in her voice.
As the University gears up for the next capital campaign, Faust has suggested that financial aid will be a focus of its concerted fundraising efforts. (The University’s last capital campaign, which ended in 1999, raised $3.3 billion in today’s dollars.)
The upcoming fundraising drive will provide Faust with a tangible opportunity—and a duty—to articulate a vision for the University and to revive the initiatives that have fallen victim to financial pressures.
But that campaign may be years away.
“What counts is what you do when you have the flexibility to do it,” Business School Professor and former University Provost Jerry R. Green says. “You know, every president has their own style.”
“I think she’s going to find the right role for herself,” Green adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 1, 1960, Nigeria formally severed with the British Empire following 160 years of colonial rule, and soon thereafter appointed Nnamdi Azikiwe its head of state. As fanfare and festivities erupted that week in the city of Lagos, roughly 30 Nigerian students attending universities in the Boston area celebrated remotely, alongside then-Harvard undergraduate Chukwuma B. Azikiwe ’63, son of the man who would soon take the helm of the most populous nation in Africa.
Around the world, heads turned toward the sovereign nation in its infancy—especially Harvard’s. Earlier that spring, Harvard was one of about 20 American colleges to lay the groundwork for the Nigerian-American Scholarship Program, a year-long pilot project that provided four-year scholarships to two dozen Nigerian students who enrolled in universities across the U.S.
Harvard Director of Admissions David D. Henry ’41 flew to Nigeria in June of 1960 to hand-pick the students who would be granted admission.
RISING STARS
The students Henry selected rose to prominence both at Harvard and in Nigeria.
Christian L. Ohiri ’64—a varsity soccer star who still holds school records for all-time goals, goals in a game, and consecutive games with a goal—was chosen that year. After Ohiri’s untimely death in 1966, Harvard’s soccer stadium was named after him.
Ohiri was one of the first participants in what would become the African Scholarship Program of American Universities (ASPAU), an initiative to provide higher education for people of the increasing number of independent African countries. The program ran from 1961 to 1975, and facilitated full scholarships to American universities for 1,600 African students.
“There was this notion that African countries would be less dependent on colonial powers and become their own bosses,” said Seamus P. Malin ’62, a former Harvard admissions officer who was a senior midfielder when Ohiri joined the varsity team as a sophomore.
“Student exchange was a way to help train for the future—that was very much the inspiration,” Malin said.
Ohiri played for the Nigerian Olympic soccer team at the 1960 games in Rome, where he scored two goals during the qualifying rounds. He had also qualified for the Olympics in the triple jump—which he turned down to focus on soccer—but would go on to be one of the most decorated track and field athletes in Harvard history, holding the triple jump record for four decades. “He was a phenomenon,” Malin said.
Though Ohiri and the other Nigerian recruits were not the first students to attend Harvard from Nigeria—Malin said he recalls admits in the classes of 1954 and 1959—there was an expectation that the handful of African students selected each year would return to their home countries to become political and intellectual leaders.
Zacchaeus O. Okurounmu ’63—now known as Olufemi Okurounmu—one of the other Nigerian students selected by Henry, graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in engineering. In an interview with The Crimson immediately following Nigerian independence in 1960, Okurounmu said that his academic interests were fueled by “much need” for Nigerian expertise in infrastructure. Okurounmu subsequently served as a Senator in the Nigerian legislature.
BRAIN DRAIN
But in the 1970s and ’80s, returning home was not the typical trajectory for Nigerians educated in the U.S.—who tended to leave permanently and raise their children in the United States, leading to a significant brain drain—according to Jacob K. Olupona, a professor of African and African American Studies and an expert on Nigeria.
At the same time, the Nigerian government sponsored scholarships to students to study abroad in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, according to Oludamini D. Ogunnaike ’07, a second-year Ph.D. student in the African Studies department. One consequence of this program was that most current undergraduates with a connection to the country are Nigerian-American; Ogunnaike’s own father attended the University of Wisconsin on a scholarship provided by the Nigerian government.
However, Harvard continues to admit a few students from Nigeria each year, some of whom plan to return to their native country.
John Yusufu ’12, who hails from northern Nigeria, said that though he shares much with his Nigerian-American friends, their aspirations are ultimately different. “In the end, my main goal is to go back to Nigeria,” he said.
He is currently studying mechanical engineering because this remains an underdeveloped sector at home.  “There is a growing need for technicians,” Yusufu said. “I hope to contribute my own education.”
And while most Nigerian-American students are not interested in moving to Nigeria, Ogunnaike said, Nigerian representation at Harvard is strong enough that undergraduates formed the Nigerian Students Association less than a decade ago.
Okurounmu said that the NSA creates a space for celebration of culture, film, and food native to Nigeria—which is especially relevant in light of the increasing number of Nigerian-Americans who are straddling multiple identities. “They might identify first and foremost as black, and then as Nigerian,” Ogunnaike said.
While Harvard itself has wound down most official ties with Nigeria over the years—Olupona points out that the University is no longer as involved in recruiting Nigerian nationals and encouraging its own students to study there—these students have taken it upon themselves to maintain the connection forged 50 years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early 1985, the winds of budgetary change rippled menacingly through headlines in The Crimson, after the Reagan Administration proposed significant cuts to federal financial aid and research funding for scientists as part of the administration’s effort to scale down its social programs spending.
Had it passed, the legislation would have had crippling effects on Harvard, a university which prides itself on its generous aid programs and its cutting-edge science resources. But Harvard’s own administration, joined by outraged students and political allies in both Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., successfully raised their voices in protest.
Budget issues continue to plague the Obama Administration as well as Harvard—the University’s endowment dropped $11 billion from 2008 to 2009—but both federal and University-wide measures have sought to keep student aid and research funding afloat despite difficult economic times.
THE TURMOIL OF 1985
The federal budget of the 1986 fiscal year would have slashed financial aid funding, capping money allotted per student on federal grants and loan aid to $4000 and establishing an income ceiling of $32,500 for guaranteed student loan eligibility. The cuts also included a $2.3 billion reduction in financial aid spending. Additionally, the Reagan administration proposed significant cuts to National Institutes of Health funding, one of Harvard’s largest sources of science funding.
“Those were challenging times,” wrote then-Vice President for Government and Public Affairs John Shattuck in an e-mail to The Crimson. “Harvard’s commitment to need-blind admissions was on the line because of the threat of massive federal student aid cuts, research funding was in danger of being slashed, and academic freedom was threatened by the secrecy regulations coming out of Washington.”
Former University President Derek C. Bok took the lead in fighting the cuts, alongside Shattuck and Harvard lobbyist Nan F. Nixon, who was then the University’s director of federal relations. According to Nixon, resistance measures taken by University officials included developing policy papers, building nation-wide support, and listening to student testimonies.
“There’s nothing like the person who’s directly affected to speak to something,” she recalled.
By the end of February 1985, college students were banding together through the Boston Area Student Coalition to organize rallies, postcard-writing campaigns, and petitions to reject the budget proposal. The $32,500 guaranteed student loan cap alone could have impacted two million students nationwide, according to Crimson coverage. Harvard dining halls filled with volunteers from the Undergraduate Council and Radcliffe Union of Students handing out postcards to send to D.C.
A local rally took place on March 14 of 1985, bolstered by statements of support by the late Mass. Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, then-Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, and former Representative Silvio O. Conte. The day after the rally, the Senate Budget Committee officially opposed the Reagan Administration’s proposal for cuts to financial aid.
At another event, Mass. Senator John F. Kerry proclaimed that the proposed aid program was “an arbitrary and capricious travesty,” adding that funds devoted to research on Reagan’s controversial “Star Wars” defense project would cover the whole financial aid program handily.
THE TIDE TURNS
In a dramatic turn of events, cutbacks in federal financial aid were excised from the Senate budget plan in May 1985.
“Thanks to the leadership of President Derek Bok, Harvard survived those times with flying colors,” Shattuck wrote to The Crimson.
Though the University had weathered the budget storm, the fight can never truly be over, Nixon said.
“It made a huge difference in the ability of students to access higher education but we knew we were going to have to do it again,” Nixon said. “When you are in tight budgetary times you don’t just win the fight one year, because the funding is annual.”
The conflict to some extent also soured relations with the federal government, with several Harvard faculty members condemning an invitation for Reagan to visit Harvard for the University’s 350th birthday celebration in 1986.
COPING WITH TODAY’S FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE
Harvard’s current financial aid program, research programs, and student life funds have faced budget anxieties of varying severity due to a struggling economy.
Harvard’s scholarship budget today is $145 million, according to Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue. Next year, $158 million is allotted.
“That’s about a 9 percent increase at a time when we’re all trying very hard to keep our operational budget level,” Donahue said. “I will say we’ve certainly had to come up with a lot of numbers behind the scenes and predict what we think our needs are for the next year.”
Some of the strategies Harvard’s Financial Aid Office has used to trim expenditures involved streamlining publications, reducing travel expenditures, and making increased use of their website to cut mail costs, she added.
“There have been a lot of parents who have been losing jobs, and people have experienced all kinds of financial hardships that really make it difficult for them to come up with the amount we expected them to contribute,” Donahue said. “We’ve been able to respond, which is really extraordinary.”
She said that a decade ago, students graduated mired in loan debt, but in 2008, the University began
eliminating the need for student loans in its aid packages. Instead, students’ financial needs are met with a combination of grant assistance and term-time jobs.
“Our hope is that [these aid policies] will enable students to go forth and pursue the career of their dreams without feeling burdened,” Donahue said.
In contrast to 1985, the Obama Administration is expanding federal financial aid—in his State of the Union Address, Obama promised to increase Pell Grants and forgiveness of student loans after 10 to 20 years, among other reforms.
The recent healthcare overhaul included legislation to move away from bank-funded loans toward an expanded direct-lending program run by the federal government. This adjustment was intended to direct $36 billion across 10 years to Pell grants for students from low-income families.
Today, alumni benefactors are heavily recruited to fill financial aid gaps. Without assistance from these individual donors, “we wouldn’t be pulling in students who were representative of what the world is becoming...and we might not be graduating students who were the true movers and shakers of the next few decades,” Donahue said.
RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH
Federal funding is also of interest to the programs supervised by Meg Brooks Swift ’93, director of the Student Employment Office and Undergraduate Research Programs. Most budget reductions this fiscal year for the programs Brooks Swift oversees were taken from administrative funds so as to preserve the student grants themselves, she said.
“We are getting more pressure from across the campus to try to use more federal funds,” Brooks Swift said, referring to stimulus package money for research available through individual professors’ budgets. “Then we don’t need to rely as much on Harvard’s dollars.”
Such funds may be available through organizations like the National Institutes of Health or the National Institute of Mental Health.
“It’s quite a layered system of what’s out there,” she said. “It’s such an interesting landscape and we’re very lucky that we have so many resources.”
A NEW POLITICAL CLIMATE
Today’s network of federal funding options for Harvard includes the National Science Foundation, Departments of Energy and Defense, and other agencies, according to Kevin Casey, the University’s associate vice president for government, community, and public affairs.
“However, like any entity reliant on federal support...this delicate partnership on innovation may be at risk,” Casey wrote in an e-mailed statement.
In 1993, Harvard and MIT created a coalition with dozens of universities and corporate partners to press for continued federal support for financial aid and research, according to Casey.
This group, The Science Coalition, represents the type of collaboration and innovation that has come to characterize several of Harvard’s fights for funding.
After the recession, current University President Drew G. Faust argued for investment in research as a “down payment on future innovation in Congress’s recovery package,” a push for research funding for Harvard that was successful. Faust’s dealings with a large number of federal officials—including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, other House leaders, Senator Kerry himself, Senator Charles E. Grassley, and newly elected Mass. Senator Scott P. Brown—are also reminiscent of Bok’s interactions with Senator Kerry and former Senator Kennedy.
One concern that did not exist in 1985 is the “generational transition in Washington” that resulted in many champions of research funding leaving Congress, Casey added.
“We are as concerned as ever about the prospects for funding of science and students during this recession and with so many competing federal priorities,” Casey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rabbi Toba E. Spitzer ’85-’86 said while she was undergraduate, she wasn’t sure she would even live to see the creation of women’s studies as an academic field at Harvard.
In 1985, Harvard was the sole Ivy League school without a Women’s Studies major. University officials appeared unconcerned about playing academic catch up, and the standing committee that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences had formed in 1982 to examine the issue of women’s studies had to start its work from scratch.
“Harvard was a bastion of patriarchy,” said Spitzer, who later became the first openly gay person to head a rabbinical assembly.
In 1985, the Committee—chaired by current Comparative Literature Professor Susan R. Suleiman—began to flesh out a new concentration proposal that required faculty approval.
“When I became chair, the Committee on Women’s Studies had existed for a number of years, but it didn’t have a lot of resources—let’s put it that way,” Suleiman said.
Her first action as Chair was to secure a listed phone number for the committee; an office and an administrative assistant followed.
Elizabeth Young ’85-’86, then president of the Radcliffe Union of Students who served on the Committee on Women’s Studies while the new concentration proposal was being crafted, said she had been concerned about the general status of women on campus: there was a “very low” number of women faculty, several episodes of sexual harassment, and lingering safety worries.
“It was clear that there was no institutional place for Women’s Studies,” said Young, now a professor of English and Gender Studies at Mt. Holyoke College. “We knew there was extremely exciting intellectual work out there that we really wanted to bring to Harvard.”
“It seemed strange that Harvard was behind,” she added.
FIGHTING FOR A CONCENTRATION
The Committee began monthly meetings to hammer out the particulars of the concentration proposal, but Suleiman said she still wanted assurance that Harvard administrators would support the Committee when the issue came up for a faculty vote.
She sat down for lunch with then-Dean of the Faculty A. Michael Spence to ask point blank whether he would welcome a proposal from the Committee. Spence said he would.
“Then we really got going,” Suleiman said.
The Committee was also adamant that Women’s Studies be a concentration, not a minor, modeling it after other interdisciplinary concentrations such as History and Literature or Social Studies.
In the spring of 1986, the Faculty Council approved the proposal, and in November, the proposal for a women’s studies concentration went up for a full faculty vote. The Committee on Women’s Studies began to steel themselves for the decisive faculty meeting.
“Some of the members of the committee were politically minded and had worked on many campaigns,” Suleiman said. “They knew that what really mattered in the end was the vote.”
At the packed November 1986 Faculty Meeting, Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 stood to make a now infamous speech about the direction of academics at Harvard, questioning whether Women’s Studies should be a part of it.
“Harvey Mansfield gave this unbelievably embarrassing talk,” Spitzer said. “His judgment against it was so Neanderthal and so egregious that people didn’t want to be a part of that.”
THE EFFORT CONTINUES
Suleiman said that part of the energy of her committee’s work was that Women’s Studies in the 1980s was because it was a new and vibrant intellectual field.
“There was the excitement of discovery and being pioneers,” she said. “You know, striking out in ways that seemed revolutionary at the time.”
Suleiman said her work with the Committee remains “the most communal experience” she’s had in her Harvard tenure.
“It was a real community effort, it was a real common effort—and that was extremely exciting and gratifying,” she said.
Still, the efforts to improve the new department’s standing did not end. Young recalled being disillusioned when very few departments actually put someone up for the newly created tenured position that allowed for a joint professorship in Women’s Studies and another department.
“It was shocking to me that there were departments that didn’t care, even with the opportunity for a free senior faculty position,” Young said.
It took advocates like Professor Marjorie Garber—already recognized as a serious Shakespeare scholar—to use their credentials to help legitimize the cause, according to Spitzer. Spitzer said that RUS formed a study group to read feminist books, put out a guide to courses that had Women’s Studies content, and worked with professors to incorporate more women’s studies content into their courses.
“We just wanted to be recognized,” Spitzer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Dean Jay O. Light speaks to the newly admitted class of 2012 this spring, casually referencing the talking points he had scribbled on a yellow notepad five years ago.
It was essentially the same speech he had given since he became dean—the only noticeable difference was the change in class year.
Light, who will be replaced by Business School professor Nitin Nohria after serving as dean since 2006, has been lauded for his deep understanding of the institution with over 35 years of experience on the Business School faculty, as well as for his amiable demeanor and sense of humor that have endeared him to many members of the community.
But while many students, professors, and alumni praise Light for his leadership during the recent economic downturn, several long-time faculty members note that Light’s agenda closely followed that of his predecessor. Some of the school’s most prominent initiatives, they say, grew out of preliminary work undertaken during the previous administration under Kim B. Clark ’74, whom he replaced first as interim dean in 2005 before assuming the permanent position.
“He didn’t stifle innovation,” Business School Professor Jay W. Lorsch says. “He came in and was really building on what Clark had done.”
MANAGING A CRISIS
When the stock market tumbled in October 2008, the Business School was celebrating its 100th year with a weekend of extravagant festivities shortly before the school too would feel the effects of the financial crisis.
But Light took quick action to minimize the impact of economic turbulence, showing foresight in taking precautions against an increasingly deeper and more widespread recession, according to several students and faculty.
“He recognized earlier than most what a significant event this was and how deeply it could impact the school,” says Business School professor David A. Moss. “He was careful about cutting expenditures early on, and now the school finds itself in a much better position because of his early response.”
Light also took into consideration the potential negative impacts of the crisis beyond the school’s infrastructure. Multiple students, faculty, and alumni praise how he handled new budgetary constraints, as he juggled various priorities while facing diminished resources.
For example, says M. Scott Daubin, a former Student Association co-president and a member of the MBA Class of 2010, Light injected additional funding for the MBA Career and Professional Development Office to help soon-to-be MBAs find employment in a much-weakened job market and allocated a larger budget to subsidize the salaries of new graduates who chose positions at non-profits.
“[Light had] been at the school for so long he really understood the MBA perspective,” Daubin says. “I think he did a good job of trimming some costs, but also investing in areas that were especially important.”
MORE OF THE SAME
Light was named interim dean after Clark suddenly announced in June 2005 that he would be stepping down to assume the presidency of Brigham Young University-Idaho.
Less than a year later, Light was appointed to the deanship on a permanent basis, leaving little time to develop his own agenda, as several faculty members say his administration seemed to be an extension of Clark’s instead.
And when the economic crisis struck halfway through Light’s deanship, financial matters occupied his attention, and professors say that the priorities of the school shifted from innovation to preservation.
During his tenure, Light oversaw the renovation of the Baker Library, the completion of the $600 million capital campaign, and the creation of the 2+2 program, which allows rising seniors to apply and, if accepted, work for two years after graduation before matriculating.
He also presided over the expansion of the Business School’s focus on entrepreneurship and the Global Initiative—a push to increase the international exposure of the Business School, including the implementation of the overseas Immersion Experience Program for students and the opening of the Harvard Shanghai Center.
Light says that his role in bringing about these changes mostly involved persuading and coordinating faculty to convince them to support his vision.
“A school is a really interesting place to try to lead,” Light says. “A firm yet inspiring touch is the art of the job.”
But several faculty members say that many of these initiatives could not have been accomplished so quickly without the groundwork completed under Clark.
“You don’t build a new center in China in three years,” Lorsch says. “I think he didn’t know how long he would be here, and changes take time.”
Light’s tenure was the shortest ever for a Business School dean, and in a Dec. 2009 email to the community announcing his departure, he acknowledged the brevity of his deanship, which may have made it difficult to carve out a unique agenda.
“I’ve stayed somewhat longer than I intended, in fact, largely because of all of you: your commitment to HBS, and your support, have made this a wonderful period for both Judy and me,” Light wrote.
“But I believe it’s time to let a new Dean guide the future path of this very special institution,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was supposed to be a world-renowned nexus of interdisciplinary science research, intended to house the University’s recently-created Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.
Instead, the plot of land set aside for the Allston Science Complex is a paved-over eight-ton steel foundation, surrounded by a wooden fence and some newly planted greenery.
Western Ave., residents say, feels more like an abandoned industrial park than the “Main Street” community they were promised.
So when the University announced an indefinite halt on the construction of the Allston Science Complex, citing unforeseen financial calamities, there remained a consensus that merely beautifying what some Allston residents deride as “Harvard’s gaping hole in the ground” is far from an acceptable fix.
But administrators maintain they have not in fact, as some residents have charged, abandoned the $1 billion project, and the Allston Work Team—the faculty-led group Faust created following the Dec. announcement—is currently investigating the possibility of collaborating with other institutions going forward.
The term “co-development” has been bandied around in the past few months as the first concrete solution to Harvard’s woes in Allston.
But the proposal raises more questions than it answers, as introducing additional stakeholders in what is already a tangle of competing interests may further complicate matters.
If the University decides to adopt this approach, co-development would require a delicate touch. Harvard would need to pin down its academic and financial goals, find a suitable partner, and enter the market at the right time.
At this point, all options are open, and Harvard has not decided what type of relationship it seeks or whether co-development should even happen, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp says.
“We’re not sure what will come our way as we start to talk to outside potential partners, so we don’t want to say we’re going to do one thing and foreclose a possibility somewhere else,” Lapp says.
But what is clear is that the University must proceed with caution.
“Some of the things that [other universities] stressed for us are when you pursue these types of arrangements be very clear, get as much expert advice as you can, and make sure whoever you’re working with shares your aspirations and your principles,” Lapp says. “When those things don’t connect, it will not proceed well.”
THINK TWICE, IT MIGHT NOT BE ALRIGHT
Finding the right partner, in addition to developing at the right time, will be key to successful co-development, University officials say.
Looking back on the experience of real estate developers, the landscape of attempted collaborations on construction projects is rife with failure.
Real estate consultant Karen Backus, who specializes in working with universities and non-profits, presented members of the Work Team with 12 unsuccessful cases of co-development out of 15 projects on which her firm has consulted at a teach-in at Harvard Business School earlier this month.
Since co-development could indicate either a purely financial collaboration between a real estate developer and an institution or an intellectual union—a pharmaceutical firm and a university lab, for example—University administrators stress the importance of identifying synergies between Harvard and any potential partner.
Private firms may want to jump on any opportunities more aggressively than can a large university with a myriad stakeholders. Even when working with firms with similar goals, fostering scientific collaboration, as history shows, requires more than physically bringing together top researchers.
“A major concern in the sciences is that Harvard scientists and private sector scientists who eventually cohabitate a neighborhood might never see or talk to each other,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman says.
For instance, the opening of the Merck research facility near Harvard Medical School has generated “little enrichment of the local intellectual environment,” a University official says—the opposite of what Harvard would hope to achieve.
The few successful collaborations have generally involved a university project that generates steady profits, such as housing or retail, according to Backus. Building a project around a more nebulous theme like biotech, though, tends to be more difficult to implement.
But even success stories can harbor cautionary tales.
MIT’s University Park, developed in conjunction with the City of Cambridge and real estate developer Forest City Enterprises, won an urban design award for a project that integrates science facilities, housing, and green space.
But it took over two decades to complete the project, says urban design advisor Gayle B. Farris, and neither Forest City nor MIT would be inclined to arrange a similar agreement.
“That tells you how challenging it is to do this,” Farris says.
IF YOU SEE THE SCIENCE COMPLEX, SAY HELLO
While co-development may allow the construction of the Science Complex to progress beyond its currently paved-over foundation, there are no guarantees that the project will follow original plans to house stem cell researchers, Lapp says.
“We are making sure that we accommodate [the Stem Cell Institute’s] needs, we want the research to continue and grow,” says Lapp. “But keep in mind, the whole Allston vision, the whole Allston plan is a long-term plan, so there’s going to be growth in a variety of research areas—whether it’s stem cells or something else—that will have to be accommodated.”
Bringing in a new partner means that Harvard would need to integrate the goals of another institution with its own, and while the University has not yet proposed any specific partnerships, potential compromises are on the table.
“[Harvard] understands that with working partners, some level of control needs to be minimized or shared,” Work Team Co-Chair Alex Krieger says.
The Stem Cell Institute’s Executive Director Brock C. Reeve says he hopes that the Stem Cell Institute will be part of the plan in Allston, at least in the long term, but adds that “there are many unknowns at the moment.”
Reeve says he does not know whether the Stem Cell Institute would fit into a co-developed Science Complex.
“In theory, yes, we’re open to it, but in practice it depends with whom and how,” Reeve says.
TANGLED UP IN COMMUNITY RELATIONS
The City of Boston and the Allston community, anxious to get the development process back on track, nevertheless hold Harvard to its original promise of building a vibrant community across the Charles. Support for a potential experiment in co-development comes with conditions attached.
Allston Neighborhood Coordinator Daniel Roan writes in an e-mail that the City of Boston would be “open” to the idea so long as it promotes “the development of well planned and financially sound development in Allston that expands economic opportunity, improves the quality of life for the neighborhood and increases housing choice.”
Allston residents, while excited about the prospect of progress, remain wary of allowing a large biotech company to set up shop on what would have been the Allston campus.
“If they’re bringing in partners, commercial partners, I worry that some of these publicly-motivated design concepts may drop away,” Allston resident Brent Whelan says, referring to the original plan to integrate the Science Complex into the community with coffee shops, public atrium spaces, and even a small science museum.
As Harvard explores new plans—which must be approved by city regulators—it must contend with a tarnished reputation among the Allston community.
Allston residents say they have been largely kept out of the decision-making process and know little about the proposal, though Harvard-Allston Task Force members were invited to the information session at the Business School.
Since the halt of construction on the Science Complex, the Task Force has not held a public meeting—though one was announced last week for June 7—and the Work Team has only met once with the Task Force to discuss the future of Allston.
“We’ve basically been frozen out,” Whelan says, noting that a much higher level of dialogue existed before construction came to a stop.
But some residents say that a chance to reexamine the plans, which would be required by the city, might be beneficial.
“Time is a good generator of creative ideas,” says Allston resident Tim McHale, adding that he hopes that a completed Science Complex “would bring new energy to the community.”
Recognizing concerns from all parties affected by construction in Allston, Hyman says he nonetheless remains “cautiously optimistic” about the prospects for co-development. But administrators emphasize the need to maintain a long view of the project’s future.
“As you make determinations, you really have to make sure you’re making the right decisions in the long term, as well as the near term, because these are ones that you’re going to live with as an institution and as a neighborhood for many years to come,” Purcell says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 2, 1985, furious anti-apartheid protestors flowed into the Lowell House courtyard upon learning that South African Consul-General Abe S. Hoppenstein was speaking to the Conservative Club. Protestors linked arms to create a human barricade, chanting “Conservative Club, what do you say? Would you invite the KKK?”
The rally quickly dissolved into chaos as student organizers lost control of non-Harvard protestors who joined the demonstration. The sound of shattering glass reverberated through the courtyard, panicking the crowds gathered there. According to an article written at the time, students blockaded Hoppenstein in the Lowell House Common Room for several hours to give him “the experience of thousands of Black and white South Africans jailed in hell-hole prisons.”
Police eventually held back the crowds to relocate Hoppenstein, which resulted in 20 students filing charges of police brutality.
The Lowell House blockade marked the peak of the anti-apartheid protests in the mid-1980s, resulting in disciplinary action for more than a dozen students.
Students from the Southern Africa Solidarity Committee (SASC) staged the protest as part of their efforts to push President Derek C. Bok to divest Harvard’s endowment from companies conducting business with the apartheid government in South Africa.
Though Harvard never fully divested from South Africa, the protests forced the administration to grapple with its role in indirectly financing the apartheid regime, and made a deep impression on the student participants, who said their lives were shaped by the turbulent events.
A BRICK IN THE WALL OF APARTHEID
Anti-apartheid protests began in Cambridge as early as the 1970s and steadily gained momentum, leading to a student take-over of Bok’s office and a torchlight parade in opposition to Harvard’s investments in South Africa in 1978.
But according to Damon A. Silvers ’86, one of the leaders of SASC, the committee was dormant in the early 80s during a period of relative quiet in South African resistance. As the situation in South Africa became increasingly dire, however, student support for the end of violence in South African grew rapidly.
“We felt Harvard University should not be another brick in the wall of apartheid,” said Jamin B. Raskin ’83, who participated in the 1985 protests while at the Law School.
On April 4, 1985, about 5,000 students gathered in Harvard Yard for a protest organized by SASC, which had invited Reverend Jesse I. Jackson to speak to the riled crowds. Jackson had written a letter to Bok a month earlier in which he urged the University to divest.
The rally was only the beginning of the passionate resurgence of anti-apartheid protests in 1985.
That year, protestors would occasionally stage “pop and stops”—activities to prove that they were well-organized enough to seize control of a major administrative building if necessary. Massive groups of students would instantly materialize and pile into the offices of Massachusetts Hall, where they handed the secretaries flowers and mysteriously said, “We’ll be back later,” before quickly dissipating.
Students also created an alternative fund to collection donations from the senior class that would not be invested in South Africa.
“Our work was profoundly creative,” Michael T. Anderson ’83 said. “It wasn’t just some pious liberal statement about the solidarity of suffering Africans. It was, ‘We can do something about this by squeezing a major institution in the country, one that claims to be very progressive.’”
Bok did respond to Jesse Jackson’s letter, writing that he shared protestors’ “abhorrence of apartheid.” But the president continued to defend his argument that taking a political stance on an issue would compromise Harvard’s independence as an educational institution. In speeches and subsequent letters to the community, Bok continued to state that it was inappropriate for a university to engage in politics or become a moral watchdog.
In the climate of persistent student protests, Harvard eventually divested from South Africa—only partially—and thereafter inaugurated a new policy: The University would not invest in any companies that did more than 50 percent of their business in South Africa.
INSPIRED BY THE PAST
The apartheid protests in 1985 occurred during a fraught time at the University in which liberal students, stuck in “the darkest years of the Reagan administration,” craved the revolutionary change enacted by the notorious rioters of the 60s and 70s, according to Anderson.
Some students in the 80s worried that their generation was “boring and complacent” compared with “all the great cultural ferment in the 60s,” Raskin added.
Anderson said that while students cared immensely about the atrocities in South Africa, the events were in part an attempt to revive 60s-era drama.
“I would get on a bullhorn in front of a crowd whenever I had the opportunity,” Anderson said.
“The political style [of the 1985 rallies] and the cultural references going on were all linked to the 1960s,” Silvers added.
Student protestors’ reinvigorated energy eventually led the University to convene the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (CRR), a disciplinary body that had not been called upon since the Vietnam War-era protests.
Silvers, who was one of 14 protestors charged in the Lowell House blockade, refused to testify at disciplinary hearings, and was eventually let go without punishment.
SHAPING LIFE
Silvers said that his activism and interest in organizing as a Harvard undergraduate had “a huge impact” on the rest of his life, shaping his career path after law school.
He now serves as the director of policy and special counsel for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), a national trade union.
Silvers said that his current work often focuses on issues related to capital markets and companies’ investment decisions, similar to the case in urging Harvard to divest.
“I am intensely proud of [the experience],” Anderson said. “We did something vivid and strong and life-affirming.”
Thomas J. Winslow ’87 said that his role in the anti-apartheid movement propelled him to write a senior thesis about marriage laws in repressive societies, including apartheid South Africa.
After graduating from Harvard, Winslow decided to study at the University of Cape Town. He later established a psycho-social programme for released political prisoners, before co-founding a trauma center for survivors of torture and political violence.
Though Harvard refused to divest completely from South Africa, the University decided to establish a fellowship for black South Africans to spend a year at Harvard in 1979.  After graduation Winslow and one of the South African fellows, Mary Jane Morifi, traveled throughout South Africa “not only to meet activists and academics, but to see how apartheid impacted the lives of ordinary black people.”
Now, Winslow and Morifi are married and live in Johannesburg with their two children.
“Perhaps it was a strange twist of fate—Harvard’s failure to disinvest, shanties in Harvard Yard, the fellowship programme for black South Africans, and my academic interests—that eventually brought us together,” Winslow wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
Today, Winslow interviews South African high school students applying to Harvard.
“It’s as important as ever that young gifted South Africans have the same opportunities to join the Harvard undergraduate community—not as historically disadvantaged victims of apartheid, as they might have been characterised in the past—but as intellectual equals to any other global candidates for admissions,” Winslow wrote.
PROTESTORS OF TOMORROW
Raskin said that alarming levels of corporate misconduct have influenced the current generation of students—from the Massey Energy Corporation in West Virginia, to BP Oil in the Gulf of Mexico, to Goldman Sachs on Wall Street.
“When I look at the state of the world today, it seems a lot more frightful and perilous than when I was in college,” he said.
Raskin added that young people’s enthusiasm and organization around President Barack Obama’s campaign is proof that students today are still eager to be politically active.
In 2001, strong student organization was evidenced, when undergraduates staged a sit-in to urge the University to pay its employees a living wage. Silvers was involved in some of the negotiations between students and administrators as a third-party labor representative.
Silvers said that his experience as a witness in disciplinary hearings in 2001 with the once-again resurrected CRR created a feeling of “déjà vu,” bringing back memories of his own experience with the CRR in 1985.
According to Winslow, global poverty and achieving the Millennium Development goals are the most pressing issues for today’s students.
“I would hope that the current generation of Harvard graduates would rise to the challenge of eliminating global poverty in the same way my generation participated in the social movement of our time,” he said.­

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As rising sophomores settle into their new residential housing next fall, they will join a group of students that embody no particular stereotype, as Houses used to only 11 years ago.
These communities, intended microcosms of the College, are the product of many student-faculty debates—the first of which were started by the class of 1985.
The conclusion of such discussion was to maintain the traditional system under which students would select their top three choices for Houses and be sorted into one of the Houses or be randomly placed into another. Typically 85 percent of the students received one of their three choices.
“Houses had reputations,” Dr. Benjamin I. Broder ’85 remembered. “Adams House was artsy, Eliot House was preppy, Kirkland House was jocky.”
The residential system led to the establishment of certain stereotypes of Houses, sometimes isolating students who might have different interests from the mainstream culture of that House, some administrators said.
Yet some alumni remembered their undergraduate days as times when they were able to celebrate each House’s independent culture—when each House represented a different home for a distinct group of students.
“Most people were happy with the status quo,” said R. Scott Falk ’85, who served on the 1985 Committee on Housing. “The evidence showed that, by and large, students didn’t want change.”
Although the class of 1985 may not have implemented a change in the residential housing program, its debates—the first large-scale discussions on the topic—would come to inform and prepare the College for the randomization of the housing selection system 11 years later.
BEFORE THE BEGINNING
Even before the class of 1985 matriculated, the residential life system had undergone significant change from its inception in the 1930s.
House Masters were appointed for indefinite terms and handpicked their future residents, who would have to go through an interview with the House Master to join the residential House of their choice.
“That was dropped because it felt like people were anxious to get into Harvard, and people thought that it was sort of odd that once you get in that you had to interview to get into a House,” said Freshman Dean and former Associate Dean of the College for Housing Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
The College evolved into the system that the class of 1985 experienced—which began in 1971—where freshman students would select their top three preferences and be sorted by a computer into either one of their choices or a random House.
Bundled in this reform, Masters and their spouses were also deemed “co-Masters,” and began to serve five-year terms, for which they could be reappointed.
But even in this system, alumni from the class of 1985 said they recall certain self-selection.
Eliot House was famous for drawing competitive skaters because of the long tradition of supporting the Jimmy Fund with the “Evening With Champions” skating show, as well as non-skating students who were interested in supporting the high-profile charitable event, according to Falk.
Even without active input from House Masters, however, the Houses became “lop-sided,” with Houses retaining distinct personality types, Badgers said, leading the College administration to begin its review of the housing system.
STARTING THE BEGINNING
The Committee on Housing, for which Falk and two other students represented the student body, was the main advisory body for the discussion on housing randomization.
The committee’s discussion on House randomization was prompted by a 1984 study authored by Associate Registrar Jay A. Halfond and Mather House Senior Tutor Steven A. Epstein, which confirmed that Houses conformed to perceived stereotypes.
In his final years at the College, then-College Dean John B. Fox Jr. ’59 proceeded to establish the Committee on Housing.
The dean handpicked his committee’s members—three student members, three House Masters, and Former Dean of the Students Archie C. Epps III—who would meet quarterly to discuss whether or not to make the housing system random.
“We [the committee] worked with the Dean of the College, John Fox, to survey students and determine whether they favored randomization of housing assignments,” Falk said. “While some students certainly favored randomization at the time, most did not, and so the committee could not recommend that the housing lottery convert to a purely random system.”
Students and House Masters were seemingly united in their opinion to maintain the status quo.
Students were loath to change the system, Broder said, because “people, by and large, went where they wanted to go.”
Falk said that the Committee on Housing survey demonstrated that “many House Masters joined the majority of students in their belief and concern that complete randomization could adversely affect the positive traditions that many Houses had proudly maintained for many years.”
The system remained untouched for the next four years.
BEYOND THE BEGINNING
The College only modified its system in 1989, increasing the number of students randomly assigned to Houses from 15 percent to 25.
And in 1995, the College endorsed a randomized House lottery system for all freshmen to be implemented in 1996.
Students today believe that as a function of this new system, their exposure to students of various backgrounds has increased.
“Because of blocking stuff, you still have large clumps of type of people in each House,” Andrew Y. Badger ’12 acknowledged. “But I’m on the football team, and I’m the only football player in the whole House.”
Dingman said that this trend is distinct from former patterns, when all varsity athletes used to live in the same House—and, as further studies showed, all concentrated in Economics, taking very similar classes.
“What’s the point of going to Harvard, with its diverse student body, if you get smothered into these communities that look like yourself?” Dingman said.
Derek M. Flanzraich ’10 recalls how his blocking group became close to a blocking group that had very different tastes from his own.
“Our blocking group [met] them in Currier—and that wouldn’t have been possible if this House system weren’t randomized,” Flanzraich said. “Becoming friends with those people was probably one of the most valuable things that happened to me at Harvard.”
“Randomization is a good example of an institutional policy that supports this core value of diversity,” Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said. Former University President A. Lawrence Lowell’s “vision was to have this House system where there wouldn’t be this divide between the Gold Coast, where students were more wealthy, and the Yard, where students were less wealthy.”
“Harvard is saying this is really important,” Nelson added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November 2010, California voters will consider a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana in the state. The proposed law includes restrictions on sale and use, such as a minimum purchase age of 21, but the bill gives marijuana roughly the same legal status as alcohol. Early polls suggest the measure will pass, although full-scale debate has not yet occurred.
Marijuana legalization is a far bigger step than decriminalization or medicalization, which have already occurred in California and other states. Decriminalization legalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana, but it does not eliminate the underground market or permit easy taxation. Medicalization is closer to legalization, but it still leaves producers and consumers in a legal gray area and collects less revenue than legalization.
Should California, or the country, legalize marijuana? Yes, for a multitude of reasons.
Legalization will move the marijuana industry above ground, just as the repeal of alcohol prohibition restored the legal alcohol industry. A small component of the marijuana market might remain illicit—moonshine marijuana rather than moonshine whiskey—but if regulation and taxation are moderate, most producers and consumers will choose the legal sector, as they did with alcohol.
Legalization would therefore eliminate most of the violence and corruption that currently characterize marijuana markets. These occur because, in underground markets, participants cannot resolve disputes via non-violent mechanisms such as lawsuits, advertising, lobbying, or campaign contributions. Instead, producers and consumers in these markets use violence to resolve disputes with each other and bribery or violence to resolve disputes with law enforcement. These features of “vice” markets disappear when vice is legal, as abundant experience with alcohol, prostitution, and gambling all demonstrate.
Legalization would result in numerous other benefits. Medical marijuana patients would no longer suffer legal limbo or social stigma from using marijuana to treat nausea from chemotherapy, glaucoma, or other conditions. Infringements on civil liberties and racial profiling would decline, since victimless crimes are a key cause of such police behavior. Quality control would improve because sellers could advertise and establish reputations for a consistent product, allowing consumers to choose low or high-potency marijuana.
Legalization would also generate budgetary savings for state and federal governments, both by eliminating expenditures on enforcement and by allowing taxation of legalized sales. I recently estimated that the net impact would be a deficit reduction of about $20 billion per year, summed over all levels of government.
The one impact of legalization that might be undesirable is an increase in marijuana use, but the magnitude of this increase is likely to be modest. The repeal of alcohol prohibition in the U.S. produced about a 20 percent increase in use, while Portugal’s 2001 de facto legalization of marijuana did not cause any measurable increase; indeed, use was lower afterward. Across countries, use rates for marijuana show little connection to the strictness of the prohibition regime. The Netherlands has virtual legalization, for example, yet use rates do not greatly differ from those in the United States.
An increase in marijuana use, moreover, is not necessarily bad. If the ballot initiative passes, people who would like to use marijuana but abstain due to prohibition would be able to consume responsibly; legalization would allow them to enjoy marijuana without fear of arrest or incarceration and without concern over quality. Some new users might generate adverse consequences for themselves or others, such as driving under the influence, but most irresponsible users are disregarding the law and consuming already.
Legalization will not, of course, eliminate all negatives of marijuana use. But just as the harms of alcohol prohibition were worse than the harms of alcohol itself, the adverse effects of marijuana prohibition are worse than the unwanted consequences of marijuana use. Legalization is therefore the better policy.
The ideal way to legalize marijuana is for the federal government to end its ban, while allowing each state to regulate and tax marijuana as it sees fit. This would circumvent the complicated constitutional issues that will arise if the California initiative passes, as federal law would still prohibit marijuana.
But California’s initiative is nevertheless a valuable step, since the federal government is not yet ready to legalize. The California bill brings attention to the issue and, if adopted, will encourage other states and the federal government to follow suit.
The U.S. experiment with marijuana prohibition is just as misguided as was its earlier experiment with alcohol prohibition. We learned our lesson once; it is time to learn it again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bill Bartley, current manager of the long-time Harvard Square restaurant Bartley’s Burgers and the son of the restaurant’s founder, recalls having radically different neighbors 25 years ago. Among his neighbors were the Bow and Arrow Pub, a sandwich shop called Elsie’s, a camera store, and a tiny jewelry store—all squeezed in just between Bow Street and Holyoke Street.
“You just don’t see anything like that anymore, the kind of stores that don’t exist anymore because people don’t shop there,” Bartley said.
Today the burger joint is sandwiched between stores such as Dunkin’ Donuts and a branch of a national TD Banknorth, though several of its iconic neighbors, such as Leavitt and Peirce and the Harvard Bookstore, remain.
Over the past 25 years, Harvard Square has faced tension between maintaining the Square’s historically eclectic vibes and the demands of a modern economy.
FACING CHANGES, CHANGING FACES
The Square has certainly undergone a major face lift since 1985.
That year saw the rebuilding of a Harvard Square T station, following several years worth of construction to extend the Red Line into Alewife. The completed Harvard Square stop marked the end of what Bartley called a “giant hole in the middle of Harvard Square for almost five years.”
The finished station—which opened for service Sept. 7 of that year—also put an end to what State representative Alice K. Wolf calls the “dishevelment” in the area due to construction.
According to Mo Lotman, author of the pictorial “History of Harvard Square” book published last fall and long-term Cambridge resident, the subway extension was followed by a series of beautification efforts in the Square.
“[It] just changed the face of the Square literally,” he said.
The Charles Square—a 4.2 acre development that included the Charles Hotel, an office building, condominiums, and a shopping plaza—was also completed that year, following seven years of legal battles.
But according to Wolf, the opening of Charles Hotel in 1985 “[drew] people from all over the world,” transforming the Square into a more international landmark.
“I think the 80s was kind of a turning point for the Square,” Lotman added.
Individual small businesses might not be as visible as a new T-stop or the Charles Hotel, but independently-owned stores in the Square have not yet been overtaken in numbers.
According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, a recent survey showed that 80 percent of the 369 businesses in the Square are in fact independent. National companies account for another 15 percent, and regional chains such as J.P. Licks and Boloco make up the last 5 percent.
Both Wolf and Jillson added that they have noticed an encouraging increase in women-owned independent businesses that are much more in the vein of the Square in the 80s.
“[They’re] going back a little bit to the idea that at least some things in Harvard Square ought to be unique to Harvard Square,” Wolf said.
THE PLIGHT OF SMALL BUSINESSES
Despite these statistics, several businesses in the Square, as well as long-term Cambridge residents, have noted a continuing transformation from unique shops to a higher prevalence of national chain stores and banks.
Paul J. MacDonald, current owner of the 126-year-old tobacco shop Leavitt and Peirce, said he believes that real estate in the Square has been increasingly leased out to tenants who can pay the highest rent, rather than to those who are appropriate for the Square.
“We end up being like an outdoor mall,” he said. “This is what’s wrong with Harvard Square.”
Wolf, whose district includes much of Western Cambridge, has lived in Cambridge for over 55 years and attested to the noticeable change in storefronts away from small businesses.
“Harvard Square had very unique businesses, they had the Design/Research [store] or many different bookstores, those kinds of things,” she said. “And then came the era of many chain stores, which we still have.”
MacDonald and Bartley claim that while Harvard Square previously catered to the local resident population, recently the allocation of real estate seemed to target the needs of Harvard University affiliates instead.
“What do they want? Fast food, cell phone stores, and plenty of banks,” MacDonald said.
But Bartley argues that from what he has seen changing in his Square neighborhood, the burgeoning of national chains in the Square is not as economically viable as one might assume.
“What we’ve seen time and time again is [banks] lease [buildings] to large national companies, and [the companies] don’t make money,” he said. “People know what they want when they come to Harvard Square, and I think what was there in 1985 is more what people want.”
Bartley and MacDonald both said they empathize with small business owners who are being squeezed out of the Square, but added that the Square is still a desirable place to visit.
“When you’re talking to someone who owns a business, it’s a shocking destination, it’s sort of lost its cache,” MacDonald said. “But as a tourist destination, it’s beautiful and it’s unique.”
“I might not be crazy about what’s in the buildings, but Harvard Square is really unique,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I felt like crap. Literally. After what seemed like a series of unfortunate personal and circumstantial setbacks, I’d been subjugated in my sophomore spring to the lowest caste of the Harvard housing system: floater. The word itself conjures up images of things fecal. A floater—an upperclassman unable to form a rooming group who is then randomly assigned a room and bunkmate for the following semester—is a lowly untouchable, a creepy loner left to bob about in a cesspool of social rejects and awkward bedfellows.
“That stinks,” I thought to myself as I saw my name listed for all to see on the door of the Winthrop housing administrator’s office. She’d posted the names and e-mails of us floaters in hopes that maybe we could form a room together before it was too late. We could then enter the lottery together, pick a number together, scour floor plans together, and hope for the best together just like everybody else.
Yeah, right.
I couldn’t help but feel so socially inadequate. What had I done wrong? I had friends. I was friendly. Maybe too friendly? Maybe friendly in the wrong kind of way. People liked me. People liked me? I thought people liked me. Somewhere along the line I had just messed things up. I blamed it on the fact that I hadn’t bought a futon for my five-person suite freshman year. The futon would have brought us together the way Harvard wanted. If only I’d bought a futon. I tried to forget about it as the term ended and I went away for the summer. Months passed and, thankfully, so too did my self-doubt.
Until the e-mail. It was instant déjà vu. The Winthrop housing gods revealed to me my floater room number and my new floater roommate. B-32. Nick. An @fas e-mail address to which I was encouraged to write. The anonymity made it feel like freshman year all over again but with budding excitement replaced by jaded frustration. Wasn’t this supposed to have worked the first time?
I included my hometown, concentration, and extracurriculars. I pushed send. A week passed. Then a month. Then I began to worry. Something was wrong. Who was this Nick character? Armed with his Anglo-Saxon last name and my Facebook stalking savoir faire, I hunted him down. From Jersey. Tennis player. Buzz cut. That’s about all I got.
With little warning and much haste, the buzz-cut jock and I moved into our dorm together. We had nothing to talk about, so we shimmied about the room in near silence. But as he heaved his final box into the room, Nick looked around our common room and said something.
“It’s kind of big. Do you think I should bring my futon from home?”
“Yes!” I blurted. “Yes, I think you should do that.”
It was just how it was supposed to be. We were so different but, somehow, once Nick brought his old red futon into our room, things started changing. Nick and I were like Bert and Ernie—no homo. My jeans were skinny, his loose. My voice loud and high, his deep and low. My boyfriends loved chatting with his girlfriends as they sat on our futon waiting for us before double dates. Nick and I invited people over in the early evening to sit and drink on our futon. We ate drunk food late at night on the futon. We talked about the people we were dating on the futon and months later when we broke up with those people we talked about them even more on the futon. With the help of a droopy red couch, two floaters became friends.
Floating hurts, but I believe being plopped into murky water could benefit more than a few Harvard undergrads. The College should maintain its incredible housing system with all the social and academic perks it has offered to students for the past century. But at the same time, it should still seek to lessen stigma and anxiety surrounding floating. Although a difficult task, Harvard should better attempt to create a culture that emphasizes the freedom of floating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gold-tipped cane resting against the arm of his chair in Loeb House, Harvard Corporation’s Senior Fellow James R. Houghton ’58 is on his way out.
The former chairman of industrial giant Corning Incorporated, Houghton presiding over the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—during a period of expansion and turbulence, a time when the endowment grew and crashed and a president rose and fell.
Houghton, an elegant industrial magnate in a bold pinstripe suit, says it’s now time “to pass the baton,” and he does so in a period of flux.
The Corporation is an aging body. Unchanged in structure since the University’s founding in the 17th century, the same seven-person board  oversees what grew from a small New England seminary to become what may be the world’s most advanced and complex institution of higher education.
Interviews with current and former members of the Corporation, administrators, and professors indicate the future of the Corporation has reached a defining moment—the criticism of the recent past has reached its members, and the call for reform has been taken to heart.
At a spry 59, William F. Lee ’72, who still runs daily and plays soccer on the weekends, promises to inject a measure of youth into the antiquated body—its members’ average age is 68, meaning the average fellow was born in the midst of World War II and qualifies for Medicare.
Lee will join the governing body on July 1, as the Corporation’s internal review of its policies gathers full steam.
The review—which includes the Corporation, three Overseers, and Graduate School of Education professor and governance expert Richard P. Chait, who declined to comment for this story—expects to release its recommendations in early 2011, according to Robert D. Reischauer ’63, who will replace Houghton as Senior Fellow.
On a body as small as the Corporation, the identity of its members are crucial to its direction. Lee’s entrance marks a moment of transition not only for the Corporation’s internal dynamic, but also for its relationship to the broader University.
The reforms emerging from the formal review process are unlikely to lead to sweeping change in the University’s governance structure. Rather, University leaders appear more committed to improving the Corporation’s visibility to the community than to making structural reform.
‘STUNNINGLY SECRETIVE’
When the Corporation convenes in Loeb House, its brick walls and the long-standing rule that its participants not divulge any of their discussions have erected a literal barrier between itself and the community.
As a result, the Corporation has been faulted for its secrecy.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors Harry R. Lewis ’68 and Frederick H. Abernathy levied scathing criticism against the Corporation in the editorial pages of The Boston Globe last December, calling the body “a dangerous anachronism” that “failed its most basic fiduciary and moral responsibilities” and going so far as to demand resignations.
In a January article for The Huffington Post, Lewis attacked the Corporation as “stunningly secretive,” noting that Corporation members’ contact information are not listed on Harvard websites, that they live in disparate areas throughout the United States and convene in Boston only occasionally, and that their meeting discussions are frequently undisclosed.
Yet the current body defends the secrecy of its workings.
“A good Corporation member has to understand the difference between visibility and confidentiality,” Houghton says. “Members should be visible but meetings really are confidential and should remain so.”
According to Houghton, Corporation meetings should allow the president to speak freely, and increased openness would compromise the candor of these discussions.
But Houghton, who in his years on the Corporation worked to establish stronger working ties with the 30 members of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, draws a distinction between the confidentiality necessary to the operations of Harvard’s equivalent of a Board of Directors and the Corporation’s visibility on campus.
Protecting the confidentiality of the Corporation’s meetings does not preclude improved visibility—Corporation members’ presence at campus events, interactions with the campus community, and broader understanding of campus life—Houghton maintains.
The Corporation of the distant past consisted of a group of six Boston attorneys who would meet with the President every other week, according to Reischauer. Such frequent interactions—and consistent presence on campus—made Corporation members an active part of the campus community.
Current Corporation members acknowledge that the recent past has been marked by a dearth of direct interaction with the community, though that may have stemmed from the sheer size of the University rather than their lack of will.
“We all would have all liked to have done a lot more interacting with the various parts of the University, but there is a time limit,” Houghton says. “This place is immense, and it strains the normal interactions because there’s so much to do.”
But the organization also became more geographically dispersed as Harvard’s reach expanded outside the northeast, and what was once a close relationship between the University’s governing body and its community became progressively more difficult to maintain.
Today, Corporation Fellows are mainly situated on the East Coast, but none live full-time in the Boston area, and treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 lives in Los Angeles.
But with Lee’s appointment, the Corporation will have a Boston-based Fellow. Lee has lived in the Boston area since joining WilmerHale in 1975 after graduating from Cornell Law School and currently resides in Wellesley, Mass.
Lee’s geographic proximity, Corporation members reason, will enable him to be involved in campus life in a way that has not been seen since the late 1990s.
The father of a recent Harvard College graduate who is currently enrolled at Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School, Lee is no stranger to the stands of Harvard’s sports arenas—women’s swimming and men’s soccer in particular, he says. And as a lecturer at Harvard Law School, Lee’s podium is just a few minutes walk from Harvard Yard.
“The hope is to find some way where people come not just to tell me what’s on their mind but also to listen,” Lee says. “By the time the fall comes along and I’ve been on the Corporation for three months, I’ll have something substantive to communicate as well.”
ENTER LEE
Walking through the Yard one day, Lee saw the bubble gum-colored chairs seating full capacity. The sight of students interacting in a shared space—the type of casual observation one makes in passing—has convinced him of the need for gathering spaces on campus.
As a recent lecturer at the Law School, Lee witnessed first hand how former Dean Elena Kagan improved student life by renovating Harkness Commons to make it more amenable to students.
“The Harkness renovation had as much to do with the morale of the students and the collegiality of the community as anything,” Lee says. “It gave the folks a nice space to gather, and I think Harvard could use a space like that that isn’t limited to the Law School—that there be some common space where the university could come together on some basis.”
Another of Lee’s stated goals is improved communication.
At WilmerHale, Lee expanded the audience for his “state of the firm address” from including only partners to every layer of the firm’s employment. Likewise, Houghton raises the possibility of an annual letter to the community from the Corporation as a potential recommendation stemming from the governance review.
“It seems to me that once a year the Senior Fellow probably should make some kind of a report to the University in general about what the Corporation has been focusing on,” Houghton says.
At WilmerHale, Lee says he saw no reason not to include the community in his speech. This tendency toward openness and transparency, if applied to the Corporation, could lead to a shift in relations between the body and the larger Harvard community.
The Corporation has garnered a reputation as a shadowy guardian of the University and its finances, but in reality, members say, it serves most frequently as a sounding board for the President and her initiatives in addition to its decision making power.
“There was a time when there was almost a collective presidency because the Corporation was so accessible to the President,” Reischauer says. “The idea that we could or should play that kind of role today is both fanciful and undesirable.”
Though the governance review is still underway with conclusions as of yet unknown, Business School professor and governance expert Jay W. Lorsch points out the remarkable longevity of Harvard’s governance structure thus far.
“It is a tribute to the strength of the original design that the Corporation has been able to do what it has done for the last 300 years,” Lorsch says. “Clearly there may be some need for change, but that’s something for the Corporation to think through.”
But this moment in the Corporation’s history—when a long-time leader is about to depart and a fresh face is set to join its ranks as the University contemplates its direction going forward—may be a turning point.
“I’m now old enough that I’ve seen four major economic downturns and every time there is an economic tsunami, the vision and strategic plan of an institution always gets questioned and the people who are leading the institution get questioned,” Lee says. “That’s healthy and part of what institutions are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Course evaluation at Harvard College originated in 1925, when The Crimson solicited student responses to some of the largest courses offered on campus, in a compilation called the “Confidential Guide of College Courses,” according to the Office of the Registrar’s website.
With the consolidation of the Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE) in 1973, the process of course evaluations became formalized. The CUE published their first guide in 1975—popularly known as the CUE Guide.
Within the next decade, the content of the CUE guide became largely administered by students who contacted professors and requested to conduct surveys evaluating their performance throughout the duration of a course.
“We took the results and had them computerized,” said Barbara S. Okun ’86, former editor-in-chief of the CUE Guide. “We also had a staff of writers and editors who read through all of the surveys to make a write-up of each course.”
Although Okun emphasized that the editors were committed to accurately reflecting student opinions in their write-ups, Harvard administrators demanded changes to the contents of the 1985 CUE Guide that would ultimately alter the administration of course evaluations and the interactions of faculty and students within the larger University community.
CENSORED CRITICISMS?
During the final weeks of production for the CUE Guide in July 1960, Director of the Office of Instructional Research and Evaluation Dean K. Whitla approached staff members regarding the harsh tone of several write-ups that he reviewed to predict Core course enrollments.
Okun said that his objections to the write-ups arose in light of a technical question pertaining to how the Guide would be printed and distributed, leading Whitla to examine its contents.
“We took great care in the accuracy of our surveys, and we only included the words that students wrote in their questionnaires,” she said. “There were instances where students complained about professors being ‘arrogant’ and ‘condescending,’ among other negative comments, and we were pressured to remove these statements.”
In a 1960 interview with The Crimson, Okun added that Whitla threatened to fire the staff members and cancel the 1985 CUE Guide unless the changes—which he referred to as “suggestions”—were implemented.
These alterations to the CUE Guide would have deleted or tempered criticisms included in 17 out of the roughly 250 write-ups contained in the Guide in descriptions of Professors Bernard Bailyn, Stephen J. Gould, Brendan Maher, and Lewis H. Lockwood.
The staff members responded to these demands in a note to readers without official administrative review responding that the altered write-ups “fail to convey the intensity of the criticism” and “sometimes misrepresent the nature” of the anonymous student course evaluations that the CUE Guide is composed of.
When The Crimson asked Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Steven E. Ozment about whether the changes constituted censorship in 1960, he responded, “If it walks like a duck and acts like a duck, I guess it’s a duck.”
Then-Dean of the Faculty A. Michael Spence said that he and other Harvard administrators were incorrect in requesting that write-ups in the CUE Guide be modified or omitted. While the University funded the Guide and administrators retained final authority over the editorial content, staff members countered that they were under the impression that the book was to be produced and edited solely by students.
Spence acknowledged that “there was a lack of explanation on the part of the administration on exactly what the policy was” regarding editing the guide. As no documents existed delegating final say over the Guide’s content, Spence requested a full review of the CUE Guide to address numerous overarching concerns.
FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES
Among the unresolved questions to be addressed by the CUE Guide review was who should use its contents and what purposes it should be allowed to serve.
Administrators routinely used the CUE ratings to single out teaching fellows for official commendation or closer scrutiny of their teaching abilities, and concern was expressed that poor ratings could carry consequences for junior professors and teaching assistants.
In a 1960 article, The Crimson reported that Ozment sent letters to department chairs stating that a total of 66 section leaders were evaluated and ranked 3.5 or lower on the CUE Guide’s 7.0 scale.
“The Guide is certainly not an infallible measure. However, when taken in conjunction with other measures, a low ranking in the CUE Guide does seem to suggest that a teaching fellow might profit from some assistance, both for his sake and for the sake of the students that he teachers,” Ozment wrote in his letters.
Additional concerns were raised in noting that Ozment recommended a variety of possible remedies, which included removal from teaching positions, for deficient instructors and assistants.
POWER PLAY
Although Harvard administrators and professors had regulated the CUE Guide extensively since its 1973 inception, the belief that student staff members retained full authority over the content of the CUE Guide and its editorial materials was extensively widespread.
“What is and what is not printed on these pages is determined solely by the student editors and not by an administrative agency,” the editor-in-chief wrote in a preface to the 1977 edition of the Guide.
The Guide was routinely reviewed by officials and often involved collaboration between students and professors. A Faculty Council discussion in 1976 determined firm precedent for its regulation.
“That course evaluations should concentrate on average responses and interpretations and not include the direct quotation of individual opinions because they are often capricious and unrepresentative,” wrote Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Phyllis Keller.
According to the last restriction, this supported instructions that editors strike the terms from the descriptions of professors in the current edition.
“All of the editors were taken aback because we felt that this was a limitation on our freedom of expression, but we were pressured to comply because the Guide was ultimately funded by the University,” Okun said.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences 18-member Committee on Undergraduate Education convened in mid-October 1985 to determine a clear editorial policy for student-run publications. After a month of deliberation, the CUE recommended that student staff members be granted substantial autonomy in determining the composition of the Guide.
The CUE also emphasized that the Guide was provided to aid students in selecting courses and not to evaluate the performance of junior professors and teaching assistants. The committee also voted to allow the associate dean for undergraduate education to play a role in the selection of the CUE Guide’s editor-in-chief.
In 2007, it was renamed as The Q Guide because it is no longer administered by the Committee on Undergraduate Education.
According to the FAS website, the Q system is used today to evaluate nearly 1,000 courses and more than 2,000 faculty and section leaders each term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You will remember your graduation as a happy conclusion to endless problem sets and exams, the beginning of the next chapter in your life, and a bittersweet farewell to close friends and valued mentors. It’s a big day.
Some of you, no doubt, are deservedly feeling very good, because you know what the immediate future will bring. We all know the statistics. The overwhelming numbers of Harvard graduates who dive straight into career-track positions at banks or consulting firms or head directly to top graduate schools. This is a safe and understandable decision, particularly in a tough economy. Among many choices, these seem to be the most challenging and most prestigious, the ones made by so many successful alums before. They also represent a clear next step, at a time when nothing seems clear.
But many graduates have not reached that point yet, and if your experience is anything like mine, finishing college is also a time of insecurity. Despite having so many options open to you, for the first time in your life, the next step is uncertain.
Until now, you have succeeded at mastering a series of well-defined tasks. Excel in school. Prepare for tests. Achieve in sports, music, arts, or some other extra-curricular activity. Impress teachers and elders. But after today, there is no immediate grade to complete, no test to ace, no award to receive. The way to judge success—and to measure fulfillment—becomes much less defined. But the lack of any clear direction is exactly what makes this moment so exciting, because it brings with it newfound freedom. So embrace it, and take the chance to do something you will not have the freedom to do again, in whatever field you feel the most passionate about.
Making that leap isn’t always the easiest thing to do. When I moved out of Cambridge I had no salary, nowhere to live, and no actual job offer.  At first I thought I was entitled to something more. I was a good student, from a top college, who had studied politics and was president of the Harvard College Democrats. Like many Harvard students, I was convinced I needed my next few years planned out before graduation day. But my desire to take the surest and most prestigious path was actually limiting my options, because I was discounting riskier but potentially more rewarding opportunities.
Luckily for me, I graduated just as the country began to notice a certain first-term senator from Illinois. Inspired, I headed to New Hampshire to help Barack Obama win the first presidential primary.
So I began to help out wherever I was needed. As it turned out, it was lugging suitcases. I became the Obama campaign’s ground logistics coordinator, traveling with Senator Obama everywhere he went.  My job was to keep track of the luggage and all the logistical challenges associated with a fast-moving presidential candidate and his entourage of staff and several dozen reporters.
I took on my humble task as if the election depended on it. I chased down a reporter’s underwear on a windy tarmac, nearly lost a luggage truck on a snow-covered mountain pass, and even broke into a carwash after business hours to make sure the campaign’s vans were clean before an important stop. Forty-seven states and 200,000 miles later, Senator Barack Obama became President Barack Obama. I know that being a “bag man” may have some negative connotations, especially in politics, but in this case it was the experience of a lifetime. And to top it off, I finished my job without ever losing a suitcase.
Along the way, I worked with countless other people taking similar risks with their career paths. None of us were making much money or building cachet in the traditional sense, but we were part of the most exciting presidential election in a generation. And when President Obama took the Oath of Office, I was there, standing in the back, helping his senior advisor prepare for the next set of challenges lying ahead.
The last few years have been an experience I will never forget and one I would never trade. I certainly did not start with the safest or most prestigious option. I certainly never thought it would lead me to a job in the White House. But by taking some risks and charting a unique path, I now have the opportunity to witness history.
Over the next few years, I encourage you to try and do the same. Your own path may not necessarily involve working on a long-shot presidential campaign. My boss, David M. Axelrod, worked the midnight shift at the Chicago Tribune, covering car accidents and murders. His boss, President Obama, left a lucrative job in New York to organize communities on the South Side of Chicago. Both men would agree that the unorthodox choices they made early in life gave them insights and experiences they’ve cherished ever since.
You will have a lot of options after today’s festivities are over. Before you determine your next challenge, remember that some of life’s greatest adventures and most enriching experiences will come from things you have yet to realize are even possible. So don’t be afraid to stray from the beaten path and take some chances.
Eric P. Lesser ’07 was a government concentrator in Kirkland House and the former president of the Harvard College Democrats. He is currently special assistant to Senior Advisor to the President David M. Axelrod.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the many thousands of classes Harvard has to offer its wide-eyed incoming students fresh out of high school, a mandatory semester-long writing course may seem less than desirable.
But a full year of writing instruction might seem even worse. Since its inception, Harvard’s writing program has both struggled and strived to meet the needs of freshmen whose writing skills vary on an enormous spectrum. One of the major efforts to close such a gap between students has been the creation in 1985 of a separate expos class engineered for students coming from weaker secondary school writing backgrounds.
WRITING HISTORY
The Expository Writing Program is one of Harvard’s oldest traditions, dating back to 1872 when the College instated a single-term writing requirement for all its freshmen.
Since then the program, commonly known as “Expos,” has expanded to cover different subject areas, such as nature writing or poetry analysis, as well as higher level courses such as a public speaking practicum. Twenty-five years ago, the Faculty approved another expos course to supplement its standard one-term requirement in order to assist “freshman with severe writing problems,” a 1985 Crimson article reported.
According to The Crimson’s 1985 coverage of this expos class—then called Expos 5 but now known to students as Expos 10—writing program officials intended it to give some students for whom English is a second language, as well as students with significantly weaker writing backgrounds additional instruction to prepare them for college-level writing.
ANOTHER EXPOS: MISSION POSSIBLE
The basic philosophy of the Expository Writing Program has remained the same over the years regardless of the type of expos class being offered.
“The mission of this course was to get people to write clearly and coherently,” said Terry K. Shaller ’72, a Mather House Senior Tutor in 1985 who taught a history-themed expos class up until the early 80s.
According to current Assistant Director of the Harvard Writing Project James P. Herron, today’s program does well “to assure that all Harvard students get a solid grounding in the common elements of argumentative writing.”
“The [whole] program was very embryonic though,” said English Professor Lawrence Buell, who served as Dean of Undergraduate Education from 1992 to 1996 and helped manage the Expos operation as the program’s titular head. “Your Expos 20 was one of the [courses] offered with some regularity, I believe, and even Expos 20 was still very much topical.”
Today’s single-semester Expos 10—recommended for students who fall below a certain threshold on the freshman writing test—is a bare bones course without specialized topics, and specifies that students who enroll must also take a Expos 20 the following semester.
The inaugural 1985 version of today’s Expos 10 combined frequent writing assignments and more extensive and intensive instructor feedback to boost the analytical writing skills of “those students who lack competence in writing that would allow them to do satisfactory work at Harvard,” a written proposal to Harvard faculty in 1985 read.
According to a Crimson interview with the late former Director of Expository Writing Richard C. Marius, 1985’s Expos 5 was an overhaul of the previous one-on-one tutorial program available for students who performed poorly in their regular fall Expos courses, a system that proved inefficient because “it was backward...to [give students] special work after they’ve gone through regular expos.”
REMEDYING “REMEDIAL” EXPOS
Throughout the 90s, Expos 10 has attempted to maintain its original pedagogical structure.
“It was paced more moderately, and was more targeted towards basic grammar and paragraph-building skills than the regular Expos course was,” Buell said. “Faculty accepted it as a transitional class for the less prepared students.”
But one of the worries surrounding Expos 10 has been the stigma of being placed into a “remedial” course. Even in 1985, Faculty were wary of terming the course as “remedial,” and gave it the title Expos 5 to avoid any pejorative connotation.
But some students who took Expos 10 this year reported positive experiences.
Stephanie N. Regan ’13, who took Expos 10 with Zachary C. Sifuentes ’97-’99 in the fall, described her Expos 10 experience as one where the students learned “how to build an essay from the ground up” and one that was “rigorous in different ways” from the Expos 20 she took in the spring.
“I had weaker English teachers in high school,” she said. “[Sifuentes] was definitely one of the best teachers I’ve had this year...he really broke down writing style and techniques.”
“And Expos 20 didn’t really do much for me besides practice the techniques I learned in Expos 10,” Regan added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“My socks don’t match,” a friend told me, as he wiggled his one Gold Toe.
“I noticed,” I replied. “You should do laundry.”
“Does it matter?” he objected. “They’re just socks.”
“’Course it matters,” I answered. “You look like a five-year-old boy.”
“Please,” he said. “If I wear shoes, no one will notice!”
At that moment, I remembered something that I’ve noticed about my classmates these past four years: We hate the mundane.
To be fair, we’re following a trend, not starting one. Young people generally hate the mundane, the ordinary obligations that most people fulfill. They ignore chores. They neglect niceties. They annoy neighbors. But they love the noble, the extraordinary feats that few people attempt. They devote themselves to cutting-edge research or life-saving charities because they want to help people—particularly people who are poor. So Harvardians can’t be bothered with everyday tasks like laundry. They have Africa to save. Harvard thinks big—not often.
I actually encourage this focus. I’m proud of my classmates’ service in charity—if not in politics. But a single-minded focus on the big things harms the little things, which are more important than we realize. You see the discrepancies everywhere: the guy who donates his books to charity but leaves his clothes at school for his roommates to put in summer storage; the girl who cares for disadvantaged kids in the afternoon but cusses out students who disturb her studying at night.
In short, you see people who are so busy trying to save the world that they forget to take care of it.
An economist might object that these kids have huge “opportunity costs.” Why spend your time matching socks when you could be saving rainforests? True, but one thing you can’t outsource is the care of your own: your family, your friends, yourself. When you fail to care for yourself, you leave that task to your friends and relatives, who, despite your protests, do worry about you. So you should call them every now and then and squeeze them in for lunch. Because if you don’t, who will? That care—the care of the little things—is necessary.
And it’s necessary to do the little things well. You can’t think great thoughts and do great deeds if you’re overtired and malnourished. Your friends also might not follow you to the barricades if they’re pissed that you forgot their birthdays.
On a more serious note, the hunger for nobility endangers everyday morality—because the latter is expected. What does it matter that you held the door open for a stranger? It’s not out of the ordinary. Or, at least, it wasn’t. Today, we act like the crucial tests come with the big things. Did you give up a lucrative job to help starving kids in Haiti? Did you take a stand against your government? Did you die in the line of duty? But the crucial tests come more often—in fact, they come everyday. Those common courtesies—which today are not so common—are tests of whether you respect all mankind. And you can see the angst that the lack of them has caused on campus. Young people today have lots of “contacts,” but few friends. When you don’t take the time to respect the people around you, it’s hard to get to know them and to befriend them. And I wish we did that more often.
Because for all the complaining I’ve done about this place, I’ve also grown to love it. I wouldn’t have complained so much if I hadn’t. And for all the complaining I’ve done about the academics, I did actually learn more from my peers. I learned which of them were—beyond intelligent and hardworking—kind. Remember that Aristotle wrote his Ethics because he thought Plato had given the philosophers too much credit. They weren’t the only virtuous ones; the everyday people, who were rarely acknowledged for their actions, were good, too.
You can find those people here: the guy who, despite being chained to a desk for 14 hours a day, still remembers to send you a birthday gift; the guy who, despite the looming deadline for his thesis on “The Commercial Paper Funding Facility,” still manages to read your column every week.
After four years here, I’ve learned that acknowledging, then meeting, then befriending those people is one of the best—perhaps the best—thing you can do in life. And that’s the best education I could have asked for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost overnight, advertising on the Harvard campus went digital.
After the arrival of the first Macintosh computers, written notices were suddenly replaced with word-processed posters as student groups gained access to desktop publishing. In his annual report to the Board of Overseers in 1985, then-University President Derek C. Bok asked faculty to embrace the potential of computing technology to revolutionize University education by limiting “the passive experience of listening to lectures and reading texts.”
Yet personal computers were largely new to its users—and the Harvard Computer Society was founded to help support user groups for the new IBM, Apple, and Compaq systems.
Christopher D. Carroll ’86—a self-professed computer geek—said he had an Apple II computer as early as high school and co-founded the Harvard Computer Society when he came to college. The club sponsored demonstrations of the Apple IIC in lecture halls in the Science Center, attracting audiences of about 200 people.
Carroll said that Harvard lagged behind some other universities that had already created formal computer science concentrations. Until Carroll was a junior, the only academic option available was to be an applied math major with a specialty in computer science.
“It was an attitude of certain faculty members that Harvard wasn’t a trade school,” Carroll said. “Harvard was for the intellectual elite and studying computers was a trade, not an art or a science.”
Joseph A. Konstan ’87, former President of the Harvard Computer Society, came to the University the first year computer science was a formal concentration in 1984. Konstan, now a computer science professor at the University of Minnesota, said that enrollment in computer science classes at the introductory level was very high.
And it was an era when computer science students worked late at night—often using terminals in the Science Center—because the systems worked much faster at night when there was less traffic. As many as 60 people could be sharing a system at once.
“That culture stayed around at least a decade longer than it needed to,” Konstan said. “It became a tradition that if your problem set is due at 10 a.m., you start at 11 or 12 and work through the night.” Konstan added that there was a tremendous sense of community during this time because he and his classmates largely worked in the same labs in the Science Center at night.
Rapid changes in the field were unmistakable, as almost all the teaching fellows in the department were undergraduates.
In addition, as early as 1983, every student had access to what was called a “low priority” computer account with 10 kilobytes of storage—about five typed pages. These storage accounts were created so students could do the programming work required to fulfill their quantitative reasoning core requirement, QR-A, where students learned basic programming.
Computer science was not formally in the Core curriculum, but according to Konstan, the inclusion of basic programming into the quantitative reasoning courses was a way of saying that Harvard believed every student needed these skills—but without having to create a whole batch of new core courses.
Starting in the mid-1980s, every Harvard undergraduate had an account that they could use to e-mail or transfer files anywhere in the world. Harvard was part of the Unix-to-Unix Copy network, which allowed for digital data transmission practically in real time. Data transfer could take a full day, depending on how far it needed to travel.
“I don’t know if it was a conscious decision or not, but Harvard trusted its students to an amazing amount of interconnected computing,” Konstan said.
Konstan said that Harvard came out with a new network map about once a month, which showed the path of computers that would need to be called to send the message to its destination.
COMPUTERS AND COURSEWORK
In the mid-1980s, Harvard also partnered with Hewlett-Packard and other companies to integrate state-of-the-art technologies into the classroom.
Hewlett-Packard gave Harvard Medical School a multi-million dollar grant to supply computers for the New Pathway program, a massive overhaul of the medical school curriculum which relied on small seminar-style coursework and case-based problem solving lessons.
A cornerstone of the New Pathway program were eight terminals and five or six students who were trained by Professor G. Octo Barnett to answer questions for students.
“We set up problems that students tried to answer using the computers,” Barnett said. “The whole idea of having computer simulations was certainly unique.”
New technologies were also made available to undergraduates. In the fall of 1985, the course “Introductory Biology II” incorporated electromyography systems used to track muscle contraction—even though there were only five in existence in the world at the time.
According to Elizabeth L. Brainerd ’85, who taught a section for the course, “It was certainly at the cutting edge of technology at the time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having lived his whole life on the same side of North Harvard Street in Allston, former Harvard employee Robert W. Alexander takes pride in his neighborhood.
“I live with the trash, and the rats, and the students,” Alexander says. “That’s my home, and I love it.”
With a foot in both the Harvard and Allston-Brighton communities, Alexander has had a front-row seat to the drama of tensions building between his neighborhood and the University over the past year, following the decision to halt construction indefinitely on the Allston Science Complex in December.
Allston residents like Alexander, comprising roughly 5 percent of Harvard’s workforce, are caught in the middle of an ongoing debate to which they bring a more nuanced perspective due to their involvement on both sides.
“I’ve attended a lot of the Task Force meetings, you know, it’s like Harvard consultants and lawyers sit on one side of the room and the community sits on the other,” says native Allstonian Paula M. Alexander—a staff assistant at Harvard Business School who has worked at the University for over 30 years and is married to Robert.
But employees from Allston say that the professed antagonism between the two sides understates the complexity of perspectives and is unlikely to be productive.
“It’s easy for an individual to point fingers at a large institution without understanding the University’s perspective, but it may also be helpful for University planners to walk a mile in local shoes,” says one Allston employee who wished to remain anonymous to protect his relationship with his employer and neighbors.
A GOOD EMPLOYER
Allston residents working for the University say in interviews with The Crimson that they have been impressed with Harvard as their employer, and many emphasize an affection for the University.
Robert Alexander notes that Harvard and Allston have coexisted for many years, and he himself first crossed paths with the University during his childhood.
Growing up next door to Harvard, he fondly remembers going to the fields surrounding Harvard Stadium to ride on a tractor with a University groundskeeper affectionately known as “Farmer Bob.”
“I’d go down there because it was beautiful,” he reminisces. “It was agrarian,” he adds, chuckling.
More recently, residents have complained that the University has shut them out of the decision-making process regarding its future expansion into the neighborhood, criticizing Harvard for abandoning the Science Complex—once hailed as a mecca of cutting-edge research—and for failing to convert Western Avenue into a vibrant “Main Street,” as promised.
But these issues are largely separate from what employees acknowledge as the tangible benefits of working for Harvard.
“I’m happy to work here—I’ve been able to support my family with this job,” Quincy House plumber Robert J. Kearney says. “Some guys on the outside [who are not employed by the University] go for months without work.”
The perks they cite range from a diverse work environment to the chance to take classes at the Harvard Extension School and certain graduate programs at a reduced cost.
With his tenth floor Holyoke Center office looking out onto Allston, Robert Breslin—an accountant and longtime resident who has been working for Harvard since he was a junior in high school—says he has enjoyed the opportunity to earn two degrees from the Extension School with University funding.
“Harvard can really offer so much,” Paula Alexander says. “Since I’ve worked here, I’ve learned here—I’ve had great opportunities and met friends from all over the world.”
At the same time, employees say they define themselves by their families, community, and neighborhood first and foremost.
“It’s my job, not who I am,” Kearney says.
NOT ONE COMMUNITY
“Being a member of both communities—Harvard and Allston-Brighton—one realizes that it’s very easy to make generalizations,” says one Harvard employee living in Allston.
The Allstonian viewpoint is sometimes caricatured as uniformly antagonistic toward Harvard, which employees from Allston say does not represent their perspective.
One Allston contingent has positioned itself in opposition to the University, sometimes making an affiliation with Harvard uncomfortable, says one Harvard employee.
“I have a Harvard t-shirt that I very rarely wear around town,” he says.
Several Harvard employees, speaking as Allston residents, say that they do not share the sense of “entitlement” expressed by some of their more vocal neighbors.
“A lot of people feel like Harvard owes them something—I don’t,” says Kearney, who has worked for Harvard for almost three decades.
Breslin echoes this sentiment, adding that Harvard has a certain obligation to look after the neighborhood, but that the University in this case is a landlord like any other.
And employees also acknowledge that Harvard’s presence benefits the community as a whole.
Pointing to Harvard’s contributions to Allston—such as the Harvard Allston Education Portal, which offers free enrichment opportunities in science, math, writing, and public speaking to neighborhood children—resident employees add that Harvard has provided significant community benefits, which are sometimes forgotten in the heated discussions over Allston’s future. Others note that Harvard’s development into Allston has the potential to create jobs in the area for locals.
But despite their more balanced perspectives, several Allston residents employed by Harvard say they were not immune to the disappointment following the University’s decision to halt construction on the Science Complex.
“They promised us the world, a utopia,” Robert Alexander says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As they ate dinner in Lowell Dining Hall one night, friends of Masako Owada ’85 had to press her for her weekend plans. But Owada was not going out that weekend, according to her friend Sunhee Juhon ’85—she had to show the Danish ambassador around Boston.
This wasn’t the end of a diplomatic life for Owada—who became Crown Princess of Japan in 1993 after marrying Crown Prince Naruhito—and it wasn’t the beginning.
Owada, whose father has served as a senior diplomat and President of the International Court of Justice, has spent her life—academically, professionally, and personally—dedicated to both the international community and Japan’s role in it.
BRIDGING TWO WORLDS
Even though she grew up around the world, Owada was more familiar with Cambridge than most Harvard freshmen when she moved into the fourth floor of Thayer in September of 1981. Her father was a visiting professor at Harvard Law School for the previous two years, and Owada spent her junior and senior years of high school at nearby Belmont High School.
During her time at Harvard, she liked to play golf and was an Undergraduate Council representative. But Owada was never just another American Harvard student and was always aware of her Japanese identity, according to Nina S. Donnelly ’85, who lived in the same entryway of Lowell House as Owada.
“She was much more of an observer than a partaker, but she didn’t remove herself from the normal undergraduate life,” Juhon said. “She was just always really dignified—even the way she dressed was very proper. I never saw her really cut loose. I don’t think that was her way.”
Owada instead tried to bridge the gap between the two cultures, joining the Japanese Culture Society and introducing her friends to Japanese traditions. Lucia A. Giudice ’85—who lived on the fourth floor of Thayer with Owada and attended high school with her—said she remembers Owada organizing a trip for a group of friends to go to the Boston Children’s Museum to see an exhibit on traditional Japanese tea ceremonies.
“She still wanted to hold on to her culture,” Giudice said. “And she loved introducing us to it.”
Owada similarly used her academic interests in economics and politics to bring together her two cultures, including working as a research assistant translating  Japanese documents for History Professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74 during the spring of her junior year. Gordon also served on the committee for Owada’s initial proposal for her economics senior thesis on Japanese-American trade relations in the 1980s, for which economist Jeffrey D. Sachs ’76 served as her advisor.
“She was a really serious and talented student who was a little bit on the shy side,” Gordon said. “She was working at a very high level.”
TWO KINDS OF DIPLOMACY
After leaving Harvard, Owada knew she wanted to continue in her father’s footsteps and join the Foreign Ministry. In 1986, she enrolled in the law department at Tokyo University to study for the Ministry’s entrance exam. She entered the Ministry only a year later—after passing an exam that less than six percent passed that year.
But only months after starting at the Foreign Ministry, Owada’s life took another turn. At a banquet in Tokyo, Owada met Crown Prince Naruhito, the bachelor prince. While the prince immediately took to Owada, there were obstacles to marriage. A Crown Princess, by Japanese tradition, must come from an aristocratic family, be under 25, and have never had a previous romantic relationship.
The 32-year-old daughter of a diplomat did not fit these first two requirements, and the Japanese press roared with speculations on the third. Owada’s Belmont and Harvard experiences also came under attack.
“There was a lot of criticism in the Japanese press that she was too American,” said Nadine H. Jacobson ’85, Owada’s Thayer floormate. “I remember thinking, as I knew Masako she was the quintessential Japanese. She was smart and respectful and reserved.”
And if she married the prince, Owada would have to give up her position as an economic specialist in the Foreign Ministry’s North America Division.
“In some ways I was a little surprised because she had such a potential for a brilliant career of her own right,” Juhon said.
Amid rumors and pressure from the Japanese media, Owada left Japan in 1988 for a two-year, Foreign Minsitry-sponsored study at Oxford. But in 1993, the Imperial Household announced the engagement, and that June Owada became Crown Princess of Japan, only the second commoner to ever marry into the royal family.
“It was a little bit of a surprise that she would want to choose that life,” Donnelly said. “But she had a strong background and a strong sense of herself. She was somebody who made up her mind, and she made up her mind about her marriage.”
Owada’s marriage was seen by many as a hope for a new step forward for women in Japanese society.
“We thought that she was going to be a more intellectual version of Princess Diana,” Donnelly said.
But the pressures of royal life were more than Owada had anticipated, and she has had difficulty dealing with the pressures of the Japanese Press and royal obligations.
The pressure to produce a male heir in the years before and after the birth of her daughter Princess Aiko in 2002 is seen by many as the Crown Princess’s breaking point. While the succession crisis ended with the birth of her nephew Prince Akishino in 2006, Owada has been suffering from an adjustment order and still remains out of the public eye.
“She is somebody who put her family and her country first,” Juhon said. “You knew that she was really studying and destined for great things, you just didn’t really anticipate it being this route.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Washington, D.C., May 27, 2025. Just four months into his first term, President Scott P. Brown faces what is rapidly becoming a severe financial crisis, with the collapse yesterday of yet another Stable Wind Farm Trust. The failed institution, Magna-SWIFT, is the largest thus far, with over $90 billion in assets. Rumors also continued to swirl about the condition of the Houston Power House, one of the nation’s largest clearinghouses specializing in weather and power derivatives. Experts warned that a major clearinghouse failure could have devastating implications.
In a prepared statement, Treasury Secretary N. Gregory Mankiw urged investors to remain calm. Secretary Mankiw also noted the strong balance-sheet positions of the nation’s leading commercial banks, including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America. None of these banks have participated materially in the wind-farm boom of the past several years, and all maintain equity capital levels well in excess of the minimum regulatory requirement of 15 percent.
The SWIFT industry’s explosive growth dates to the beginning of the Palin Administration in 2017. Spurred by President Palin’s aggressive subsidies to clean-energy sources and a series of technological breakthroughs, wind power quickly displaced almost all other forms of energy. The huge scale of wind-farm construction—the total value of wind farms worldwide exceeds $5 trillion—was facilitated by the innovation of the SWIFT structure. A SWIFT is a specialized investment fund that holds a broadly diversified portfolio of wind-farm assets. These assets generate revenues that are tightly linked to the price of electricity: When electricity prices are high, SWIFTs enjoy higher revenues. SWIFTs have become expert at using customized derivatives to offset the risks associated with these revenue fluctuations, yielding net earnings that, until recently, had appeared to be virtually risk-free. They then issue short-term debt backed by these stable earnings. A typical SWIFT finances 90 percent of its assets using overnight notes that yield only slightly more than Treasury bills.
Importantly, SWIFTs are not banks; they are more akin to private investment pools, like hedge funds or private equity firms. Moreover, they have universally opted to keep their assets below the $100 billion “Too Big to Fail” threshold that regulators use to classify any financial institution as systemically significant and hence subject to added supervision. Given these two facts, SWIFTs have not been subject to the strict capital and liquidity requirements imposed on banks in wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-2010. In the meantime, the major banks, unable to compete with the low funding costs of the SWIFTs, have stuck to more traditional lines of business, which, while steadily profitable, have shrunk considerably in recent years.
The first cracks in the SWIFT model appeared in October of last year, with the failure of the relatively small Pro-SWIFT. Pro-SWIFT had an imprudently large fraction of its assets invested in a single Georgia wind farm, which was forced to shut down for two weeks over protests that its turbines were killing large numbers of local waterfowl. The resulting revenue loss forced Pro-SWIFT to sell assets in an effort to service its maturing short-term debt. Although only $10 billion of assets were liquidated, they fetched just 60 cents per dollar of book value. J.P. Morgan, in purchasing the assets, noted that, “Our more conservative financial policy puts us at a disadvantage in buying wind-farm assets—hence the large discount.” As a result of the fire sale, Pro-SWIFT creditors experienced significant losses.
These losses were the first in the history of the SWIFTS, and they had a powerful effect. Creditors of other SWIFTs, awakened to the risks involved, began to refuse to roll over short-term loans. This has led to further liquidations, bigger fire-sale discounts, and a cascading effect. To date, over 50 SWIFTs, representing over $700 billion in assets, have failed. Yesterday, it was reported that Berkshire-Hathaway was in discussions to acquire Magna-SWIFT’s wind-farm assets for 30 cents on the dollar.
The clearinghouse industry has been another victim of the crisis. Clearinghouses grew rapidly in the wake of 2010 reforms that targeted the over-the-counter derivatives market. Clearinghouses were meant to bring a greater level of stability and transparency to derivatives trading. But this industry has become more fragmented than originally envisioned, and some argue that competition among clearinghouses has led to a “race to the bottom” whereby the clearinghouses require insufficient collateral from the SWIFTs they deal with. The Houston Power House is said to have large, uncollateralized exposures with Magna-SWIFT, and observers estimate it could lose $8 billion from these exposures alone. Power House Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Tourre was unavailable for comment.
Thus far, consumers and non-energy-related businesses have not felt much of a credit pinch. Yet, analysts warn that, in spite of the strong position of the banks, a powerful credit crunch is inevitable. “This is going to be worse than 2008,” said Nouriel Roubini of NYU. “Sure, the banks look healthy now. They have been well-regulated and very prudent. But somebody is going to have to buy up trillions of dollars of these liquidated wind-farm assets. The huge discounts will make it impossible for the big banks to say no to this bargain. And when they do, they will have much less left over for their traditional lending activities.”
In a related development, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs denied allegations that the firm had taken a large short position in a synthetic SWIFT in April of last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Book checker, book checker, please check my book! Open my bag, please take a look—Book checker, book checker, please check my book, Oooooh book checker!”
The long legs of 18-year-old Conan C. O’Brien ’85 bounded across Harvard Yard, red hair bobbing up and down, his impeccable mock cockney accent ringing out into the night.
O’Brien’s Holworthy 16 and later Mather House roommate Eric B. Reiff ’85 strode alongside him, laughing aloud and thinking to himself, “That’s unusual.”
“Most of us are not walking around making up musical comedies in our heads when we’re 18 or 19-years-old,” Reiff said.
The subject of O’Brien’s musical ode was an elderly gentleman who worked the desk at Lamont Library in 1985. O’Brien befriended the book checker, always engaging him in hilarious banter on his way out of the library, according to Reiff.
“Conan does not have an elitist bone in his body,” Reiff said. “He is as interested in what the book checker says as what some eminent professor says—and is open to the idea that the book checker might be funnier.”
From running the Lampoon, to penning Saturday Night Live sketches, to hosting Late Night with Conan O’Brien for 16 years, and finally to his brief stint as host of The Tonight Show, Reiff said there are things about O’Brien that have never changed: keen powers of observation, a killer range of spot-on impressions, and a genuine interest in everyone he meets. And, of course, that hair.
THE EARLY YEARS
The third child of six in a big Irish Catholic family, O’Brien grew up in Brookline, Mass. with father Dr. Thomas O’Brien, a physician and Harvard Medical School professor, and mother Ruth O’Brien, an attorney. The O’Briens were incredibly “gracious and generous,” Reiff said, and frequently opened their home to their son’s roommates.
“It was this big, rambling, wonderful family house filled with wonderful family people and a loving mother and a loving father—it was almost the kind of family you dream of having but don’t think can be found anywhere,” said O’Brien’s former roommate, Ford Foundation President Luis A. Ubiñas ’85.
According to Ubiñas, O’Brien’s middle-child status forced him to cultivate two important skills: watching and communicating.
Indeed, the other member of the Lamont book checker’s “two-person admiration society,” O’Brien’s friend Edward L. Widmer ’84, said that “with Conan, every single thing over the course of the day is an object of humor and observational comedy and wordplay—it was just always great to be around him.”
After graduating as valedictorian from his class at Brookline High School, O’Brien arrived at Harvard full of contagious energy.
“My first impression was that he was incredibly tall and incredibly red—he seemed seven feet tall to me and that giant shock of unruly red hair was unlike anything you’ve ever seen,” Ubiñas said.
His height still resonates with Lampoon buddies 25 years later.
“I have to stand on a chair when we kiss,” his friend Mark R. Ganem ’85 joked in an e-mail to The Crimson.
But did his peers know he was destined for stardom?
“I always thought that of all the talented people I knew in college, Conan was the most likely to appear on the cover of Time magazine—I just thought it would be for mass murder,” Ganem continued in jest.
In a Commencement issue for the graduating class of 1985, The Crimson called O’Brien the class’s “pre-eminent jokester” and predicted big success for the “gangly, freckle-faced jester.”
But O’Brien almost didn’t get the chance to cultivate this glorious reputation—all because of innocent curiosity and a bag of Twinkies.
MISCHIEF MAKER
One question plaguing O’Brien and his roommates during freshman year was whether or not Twinkies were combustible.
In searching for the answer, the boys managed to set a garbage can on fire.
“For fear of burning down all of Holworthy, we threw the flaming can out the window, where it promptly landed at the foot of one of the resident deans—fortunately we were all such good guys that no one wanted to kick us out," Ubiñas said.
Had O’Brien been expelled, he would have had fewer chances to perfect his imitation skills, which have served him well in the world of late night talk shows. Friends say O’Brien mimicked everyone from professors to politicians.
Once, O’Brien and Reiff attended a convention to support Evelyn F. Murphy, who was running for Mass. lieutenant governor against John F. Kerry. Kerry himself strolled over to the Murphy T-shirt clad boys and started persuading them to shift their loyalties in a “very high school politics kind of way,” Reiff recalled.
“Conan thought this was hysterically funny,” Reiff said. “He loved to talk about it and reenact it—he’s a great mimic and he noticed things other people didn’t notice.”
WORK HARD, PLAY HARD
Reiff said that if there was one thing in O’Brien’s life that was not a joke, it was his schoolwork.
A History and Literature concentrator, O’Brien crafted a senior thesis entitled “The ‘Old Child’ in Faulkner and O’Connor.” The 72-page typewritten work argues that the New South’s emerging identity is manifested in the literature of William Faulkner and Flannery O’Connor via the motif of children that age too quickly, a phenomenon O’Brien termed “literary progeria.”
It’s not hard to believe that the author of this thesis also catapulted the “masturbating bear” character to fame on national television when one reflects upon the work he did in his other writing outlet: the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
By sophomore year, O’Brien had been elected Lampoon President—a role that suited him beautifully, according to Widmer, who said O’Brien had “the body of Abraham Lincoln and the head of Martin Van Buren.” He became the first leader in the magazine’s 134-year history to reign for two terms.
“The whole job is to try to strike a balance between trying to make as many jokes as possible and appear as non-caring as possible, and yet caring enough to get things done,” O’Brien said in his 1985 profile.
Often, O’Brien’s actions spoke louder than words.
One day in 1984, O’Brien and a few ’Poon affiliates masqueraded as security guards while a decoy in a penguin costume made a grand entrance into a Science Center hall where actor Burt Ward was displaying his Batman costume. According to Widmer’s version of the tale, the penguin unleashed the code words:
“Riddle me this, boy wonder: when is a security guard not a security guard?”
At that moment, the boys hit the lights and dashed towards the costume. But there was one problem.
“We meant to turn off all the lights in the Science Center, but they only have dimmer switches,” Widmer recalled. “It was kind of a bungled prank.”
In the ensuing chaos, O’Brien managed to snatch the costume away.
“I just remember looking at his legs running up the Science Center stairs as I was being tackled by the Dunster House Film Society,” Widmer said.
The legacy of absurdity has certainly not dried up in the Lampoon Castle.
Outgoing Lampoon Ibis Benjamin U. Steiner ’10-’11 said that “Brother O’Brien” still inspires ’Poonsters.
“Additionally, if we say his name at the Hair Cuttery we get a free bottle of styling mousse,” he wrote in an e-mail, in typical Lampoon jest.
STAR ON THE RISE
After graduation, O’Brien ventured west and snagged jobs penning Saturday Night Live sketches and Simpsons episodes. When he took over David Letterman’s Late Night slot, Reiff said O’Brien’s “emotional intelligence” shone.
“I love when he gets out of the studio and jumps into situations with ordinary people,” Reiff said. “He played ‘old time baseball’ on Long Island, he tried to reunite two former best friends that he met in Finland.”
“It’s as if the whole world is his roommate,” he added.
In 2004, NBC promised O’Brien that in five years he’d be hosting The Tonight Show. O’Brien indeed ascended to the post in 2009, but after seven months NBC gave the show back to Jay Leno when O’Brien declined to accept a later time slot, a move he felt would have betrayed the show’s integrity.
Reiff said the way O’Brien prioritized his staff in his NBC negotiations was completely in line with his character, just as he paid his staff out of his own pocket during the 2008 writer’s strike.
O’Brien will launch a new show on TBS in November, but not before he wraps up his “Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour.”
“He’s a keeper—I was shocked they didn’t want to keep him and build a long-term franchise around him,” Reiff said of the NBC executives. “But the way he handled it shows his character. His audience has loved his humor for a long time, but the battle with NBC gave them a glimpse of his character. That’s why they have rallied around him the way they have.”
In his 1985 profile, O’Brien made a rather prophetic closing remark:
“The perfect world would be where the ‘Conan O’Brien Show’ would be on, and you’d be reading my short story somewhere and wearing my designer jeans,” he had said.
As far as realizing dreams goes, O’Brien has done quite nicely, though we’re still waiting on the designer duds. Maybe by his 50th reunion?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fierce has been the uproar surrounding the French National Assembly’s recent efforts to outlaw the wearing of the burka (a full veil that masks a woman’s face and body, worn by some Muslim women). Although France has so far only managed to pass a non-binding resolution that calls the burka contrary to French republican values, many say a full ban is not far away.
Many Americans find such a prohibition distasteful. Their first argument has been that some women, for all we know, really do want to appear so garbed in public. They feel that it’s just as tyrannical for a non-Muslim majority to force Muslim women not to wear the burka as it is for Muslim men to force Muslim women to wear it.
By contrast, some French anti-burkists argue that wearing the burka could be a safety hazard while driving at rush hour on crowded highways, for example. Likewise, if the burka remains legal, hardened non-Muslim criminals disguised as Muslim women could then be able to commit any number of crimes with great impunity. (Apparently, one such crime has already occurred.) Others have argued that because the French state outlaws walking down the street in the full monty, why can’t it outlaw its exact opposite? Yet another and more interesting argument has to with feminism and human rights: All of us would agree that wanting to be someone else’s slave is unnatural. No woman in her right mind, runs the argument, can truly want to wear a burka; and even if she thought she did, humanistic states and societies should everywhere forbid this nefarious practice. Our faithful neo-Marxist friend—false consciousness—is very useful here.
Interesting statements, then, but the arguments that matter most to me are those that have to do with the French and the American definitions of freedom, politics, and social order.
To illustrate how different these definitions can be, we can look to some important and recent issues on which French and American views have differed completely. This past year we were reminded that millions of Americans thought that access to medical care was an earned privilege and not a universal right. In this same mode, as is well known, the right to an education is likewise not guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Very few French people think about medical care and education in this manner.
In brief, the French and American republican traditions are both children of the Enlightenment but they are not alike. They both defend the rights of individuals, the one with “liberty, equality, and fraternity,” and the other with “freedom and justice for all.” But they don’t do it in the same way.
American Republicanism is focused on the defense of individual political rights against a distant, inefficient, and predatory state. The Founding Fathers did not particularly want to kill King George. They wished merely to ignore him. Nor did they wish to turn American society upside down: Revolutionary Americans, like most Americans today, basically thought that their quasi-stateless society was working just fine. (Well, sort of, in any case.) The American Revolution was not about social change, and it is very suggestive that American Common Law went through the Revolution basically unaltered. Individual rights are the key to the soul of American politics and so it is that the 10 amendments are an essential ingredient of this individuating view of politics.
French history has been differently configured. The French Revolution’s emphasis was less on liberty than it was about equality and fraternity in a “regenerated” social world. Individuals had rights, of course, but these rights were to find their true meaning, or so the French revolutionaries supposed, in a highly communitarian definition of what citizenship should be. The idea of free-standing pioneers and lonesome cowboys struggling on alone in distant places on some lonely trek has no place in French folklore. And while the Revolution was not as successful as its early proponents had hoped, some of that publicly defined universalism from 1789-1794 survives in French consciousness to this day.
For an American sensibility, the issue has to be seen from the point of view of individual rights: If women want to wear this cloak, they have a perfect right to do so, even in eyes of those Americans who are most hostile to foreign ways of living. It matters not whether these women wear the burka in public or in private, because their “rights” are the same. However, public space in the French scheme of things is not just a non-private and therefore public space by virtue of default. It’s a universalist space where citizens interact. From a French perspective, refusing to show your face in a public space is a refusal not just of custom, but of interactive citizenship.
And now: What then to decide? Alas, for myself, I just can’t conclude.
In the olden days of yesteryear, Democratic Party stalwarts responded to Senator Goldwater’s plea (“In your heart, you know he’s right”) with a crisp “But in your head, you know he’s nuts.”
Well, in my head, I know that Muslim women should everywhere be allowed to wear the burka. Of course, some will surely do so because they are victims of unpleasant patriarchalism. But then again, in Western culture also, many fathers drive their daughters to distraction and many domineering men drive uncertain women to drink and despair, but we’ve learned to live with many such injustices and inequalities.
In my head and in my heart, full as it is with the memories of a French childhood, I do so dislike the burka that outlawing it in France seems to me to be more or less acceptable, even if that should not be the case in the United States. It has no place in French life and history, and outlawing the burka might well have been one of the very few items of public policy on which Robespierre and Marie-Antoinette, or Joan of Arc and the Marquis de Sade, would have readily agreed.
Wanting to wear the burka seems to me to be a self-inflicted wound that I just can’t accept. In this symbolic matter, the French tradition seems to me to be for France, at least, the more plausible alternative: for France, and eventually, for all women everywhere.
Conclusion? Is it, as David Hume put it so pithily, that “reason is and for ever should be the slave of the passions?” Yes, surely so. But then again, if that is indeed the case, if this rejection of the burka makes passionate sense for me, how will other passions work out for devout Muslims of both sexes, wherever they may be?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since its establishment as an independent institution in 2007, the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has undergone phenomenal growth, with a nearly 37 percent rise in undergraduate concentrators in the past three years.
As the school develops a unique identity within the University, SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray has detailed a number of lofty aspirations for expansion. She hopes to grow the student body by an additional 45 percent, expand the faculty by 30 or more full-time-equivalent members, and increase staff assistance—an area that most departments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are trimming.
And thus far, SEAS’ remarkable capacity for growth shows no signs of abating—a potentially worrying trend that might force the school’s administration to discover new ways to manage the growth while it operates within budget constraints and marshals finite research and lab space.
“My own opinion is that you may want to not stop things, but put on slight brakes,” says former SEAS Dean Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti. “You may need to cut back and invest very carefully until the sun really shines.”
SEAS is less dependent on its endowment than FAS is, and the engineering school had substantially healthier reserves when the financial crisis required much of the University to cease growth. But the school nevertheless faces an almost certain decrease in available financial resources in the future.
“Whether it is in physical resources or in human resources or in other financial resources, our approach has been to optimize the use of current resources...[to continue our] high aspirations despite the financial challenges,” SEAS Associate Dean for Finance and CFO Harry E. Dumay says. “So the question is, how do we use resources more wisely?”
With an eye to the future, SEAS must now support its expansion by making tough decisions as it seeks to improve its allocation of space and maintain funding for graduate research as resources become tighter.
UNDERGRADUATE STRETCHES
Ironically, the difficult decisions facing SEAS have emerged as a consequence of the continuous growth of interest in the school since its inception.
Over the past three years, the Harvard admissions office has seen a 68 percent surge in applicants who list their primary interest as engineering science, while the total number of applicants to Harvard increased by only about 11 percent during that period.
These figures translate into an unprecedented number of potential engineers among the student body: of the roughly 1,600 students who will matriculate to Harvard this fall, one in nine say that they intend to concentrate in engineering.
The rapid rise in student interest seems to be due to a combination of the increased visibility of SEAS since its founding as an independent school and a growing national interest in engineering and applied science.
Prior to 2007, engineering concentrators studied within the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which was not fully independent from FAS. Once SEAS became its own school, the admissions office began heavily advertising engineering opportunities to students.
“Basically any time we saw students, we talked about the new school,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in March.
In addition, national engineering interest has been rising since 2008 and remains significantly heightened from its levels a generation ago, according to data collected by the Higher Education Research Institute.
All of this means more students than ever before may be declaring a concentration in engineering sciences, computer science, or applied mathematics in the coming years. But it remains an open question as to how the school will handle a potentially enormous influx of new students.
FACULTY BLOATING
To maintain a six to one student to faculty ratio in SEAS, the school hopes to employ the necessary number of non-tenure track faculty members to serve as instructors, earmarking applied math as one discipline that might receive a number of these preceptors and lecturers.
“If we have 200 new concentrators show up that weren’t there before,” Murray says, “we will add non-ladder faculty, including preceptors and lecturers.”
These additional teaching staff members, administrators say, would be a permanent addition to the school even after searches continue to add the approximately 30 new faculty members that the school ultimately hopes to employ.
These preceptors will be serving not only as teachers but also advisers who will “know the curriculum really well,” Murray says.
Associate Dean for Administration and Academic Affairs Edward Kleifgen notes that the school already employs lecturers, visiting lecturers, and other temporary non-ladder faculty frequently.
“I don’t think any of this detracts from the faculty leading the teaching effort here,” he says. “It’s supportive of the faculty.”
REWORKING FINANCES
Much of the engineering school’s future expansion will depend on the performance of the endowment—from which SEAS draws 45 percent of its yearly budget—as well as the school’s ability to find alternative sources of capital.
Next year, SEAS will be facing the same 12 percent reduction in its endowment payout as other Harvard schools, an income loss that the school will offset by drawing from the financial reserves it built up in the years before the financial crisis.
According to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, FAS was in “tremendous growth mode over the past decade,” when SEAS was still in the process of saving.
“When you look at the times when the endowment was doing well, we were extremely prudent,” says Linda Fates, associate dean for the SEAS office of resource development. “Otherwise, today we would be in trouble.”
Nevertheless, the reserves will not provide an unlimited source of funds in the case that uncertainty about the global economy leads the markets to return to fall 2008 levels.
“If [the endowment] super-tanks again, we’re not getting 30 more faculty for a very long time,” Murray says.
Despite these uncertainties in funding, SEAS administrators say that they have planned extensively for contingencies.
“We don’t want to give the impression that we’re being complacent about this,” Fates says. “We’re aggressively optimistic.”
FINDING ROOM TO GROW
In the face of expected expansion, another potential constraint confronting SEAS is the limited amount of laboratory space—a problem Murray acknowledged at her March All-Hands Meeting, saying that space at the school was “severely constrained.”
Despite the noted space crunch, SEAS Executive Dean Fawwaz Habbal says that administrators hope to nearly double the proportion of SEAS classes that include a hands-on component—and thus require time in teaching labs.
So far, SEAS has dealt with limited lab room by reconfiguring existing space to make it more efficient and capable of hosting different experiments.
To this end, the school even brought in Director of Teaching Labs Anas Chalah in 2008 to reorganize many of the teachings labs: he installed moveable benches and multi-purpose instruments and oversaw the conversion of an outdoor lightwell in Pierce Hall into a 3-D printing facility.
But SEAS administrators say that they are aware of the continued pressure for space. Murray says that she believes the new teaching labs in Northwest and Pierce will roughly provide sufficient additional resources until the number of SEAS concentrators reaches 600. But she adds that the school could hit this benchmark in the next three years, if the number of concentrators continues to rise at its current rate.
One solution currently under discussion is the creation of an additional building between Pierce and Cruft Laboratory, a replacement for the sky bridge that currently links the buildings. The proposed building—which could have up to 12,000 square feet of floor space—could even be partially used as student social space, Habbal says.
But finding the resources to construct the building will require additional fundraising by SEAS: “We don’t have the money to build it yet,” Habbal says. “But we are planning it.”
GRADUATE GAPS
In the face of increasing financial concerns and expansion in other areas of the school, the continued support for SEAS’ graduate program may be in jeopardy.
SEAS Director of Graduate Admissions and Financial Aid Julie S. Holbrook concedes that, while not yet finalized, graduate student support is a “huge investment” for the school, and that it is “certainly something that people are talking about reducing.”
SEAS provides fellowships to its graduate students for the first year and a half, after which the students typically receive either National Institute of Health, Department of Energy, or Department of Defense grants.
These fellowships “could be” reduced in length from a year and a half to only a year, according to Murray, and such downsizing presents a more viable option than decreasing the number of graduate students.
But in addition to the potential cutting of SEAS financial backing, some professors express concerns that federal support could dry up—a trend that affects some fields more than others.
Murray says the possibility that federal funding will stagnate presents a “real worry” for SEAS. Funding from NIH will continue to grow, but at a slowing rate, while funding from the National Science Foundation will also increase at a relatively slow pace, she says.
“It’s hard to find sources for resources for graduate research,” says Roger W. Brockett, professor of electrical engineering and computer science. “The federal government decided a few years back it was going to make universities pay more for its graduate students.”
Dumay says that SEAS plans to deal with any potential funding issues by continuing to enhance its allocation of resources while seeking to diversify its funding.
SEAS hopes to supplement any potential loss of federal or school funding with either endorsements from industries or support from foundations, as more institutions increasingly seek to split their research costs with universities, according to Dumay.
“In all areas, we will continue to think about how to use resources,” he says. “Do we shift resources? Do we use different funding sources?”
But a cut in the graduate program could stymie growth in the faculty, as many members join with the expectation of having a certain number of graduate students in their laboratories, according to Venky.
“You cannot run a healthy research enterprise and an undergraduate education without a healthy graduate program,” he says. “If SEAS has to grow its faculty, then the graduate body has to grow.”
“The size of the faculty, the graduate student body, and space are all linked,” he adds.
SEAS IN FAS, IN FUTURE
Facing large-scale expansions in its undergraduate and faculty footprints, SEAS must look to surmount the challenge of continuing its expansion while it recognizes its financial constraints.
The school plans to optimize its budget by accessing overlooked funds, thus regaining a few million dollars and bolstering its existing income stream with new funding from the private and industrial sectors, according to Dumay. These methods would allow for the various plans for expansion.
“We plan to grow without growing apart,” Murray wrote in an e-mailed statement in March.
At the same time, SEAS hopes to find its niche within the University—by working with FAS, for example.
Smith affirms that SEAS’s place is “really embedded” into the larger umbrella of FAS. “It really excels because of the kinds of connections it has more broadly,” he adds.
With a constantly evolving identity, SEAS confronts the challenge of fine-tuning its goals for expansion so that it may ultimately find its place within the larger University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September 1981, Kevin Jennings ’85 sat on Tercentenary Theatre, listening to his freshman dean welcome his class to the College.
Jennings said he remembers that the dean made a joke: “Look to your left. Now look to your right,” the dean told the new freshmen. “One of the three of you won’t make it to graduation.”
But Jennings did not think it was very funny.
“I was terrified,” Jennings said. “I knew I was going to be the one who wouldn’t make it to the end.”
Jennings subsequently decided to accept sophomore standing as a freshman.
“I thought, ‘I better get out of here as fast as possible before they realize I don’t belong,’” he said.
Jennings’ anxieties were compounded by the fact that he was openly gay at Harvard, during a time when the University lent virtually no support to LGBT students.
Despite Jennings’s worries as a freshman, by the time he graduated in 1985, he had been elected by his peers to deliver the Harvard Oration at commencement.
After graduating, Jennings established the first Gay-Straight Alliance in the country as a teacher at Concord Academy. He also founded the Gay and Lesbian Education Network, and has written several books on LGBT education.
Today, Jennings serves as the Assistant Deputy Secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools at the U.S. Department of Education. And most recently, he was elected by his class to be Chief Marshal at the 25th reunion this spring.
Jennings said that his difficult childhood and a challenging experience at Harvard shaped the way he thinks about education—and how he believes Harvard can make progress in the future.
FROM TRAILER PARKS TO HARVARD
Jennings grew up in trailer parks in rural North Carolina. Neither of his parents had completed high school, and no one in his family had attended college.
After Jennings’ father died when he was young, Jennings’ mother resorted to cleaning houses and working at a local McDonald’s to support their family.
Open about his sexual orientation, Jennings said he was additionally challenged by the “huge disadvantages to growing up as a gay fundamentalist.”
Jennings said his great uncle “Mickey” had eventually died from alcoholism, brought on because he was gay at a time when the world would not be accept him, Jennings added.
Despite such hardships, Jennings said that his mother convinced him that he would go to college.
When he arrived at Harvard, Jennings said he felt out of place. He recalled once being astounded when a classmate left the dining hall to go out to eat because he did not like what was being served.
“I think part of what saved me was that I was so out of place I didn’t know how out of place I was,” Jennings said.
Despite this characterization, his close friend, Luis A. Ubiñas ’85, said he remembers Jennings as “full of bravado.”
Ubiñas added that Jennings likely did a good job of concealing his insecurities and projecting confidence, as Jennings eventually became a campus leader in drama and performing arts.
After Jennings was selected for a small sophomore tutorial taught by French History Professor Patrice L. R. Higonnet ’58, Jennings decided to study French history—though he added that, at that point in his life, he was lacking the “sophistication and understanding” to explore other academic disciplines.
THE STIGMA OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION
As Jennings started at Harvard, the AIDS epidemic raged in the background, with gay men in particular being targeted as fueling the public health crisis.
Higonnet said that Harvard was not particularly welcoming to gay students at the time, adding that he remembers “being surprised by [Jennings’] determination and resolve to be openly gay throughout his life.”
“You would have expected him to be very quiet about this in general fear of retribution. He was not,” Higonnet said.
But Jennings was certainly not silent. In 1982 he directed two plays in which the reviewer criticized his direction, writing that “Jennings let extreme political leftism overshadow the acting.”
Undeterred, two years later Jennings directed “Vieux Carre” by Tennessee Williams, a play set in the South with overt references to homosexuality.
In addition to Higonnet, Jennings cited English Professor Joseph A. Boone—the first openly gay professor at Harvard—as a source of inspiration.
“I am deeply touched that I could have been some sort of positive image and role model,” Boone said.
According to Boone, Harvard in 1985 “was a very curious place”—Harvard maintained a “showy, gentlemanly atmosphere,” held over from another generation.
Boone added that though the school was not supportive of gay students or faculty, it was “fine for people to have alternative lifestyles as long as they weren’t explicit about it.”
Boone said he felt that he had to “tip-toe around and separate [his] lives completely.”
Rhonda Wittels ’79—who serves as president of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus, which was founded in 1984—said that she felt welcome at the College. But Wittels qualified this sentiment.
“The freedom we had in the 70s might have been squelched in the 80s, when everyone was trying to go to business school,” she said.
In his graduation speech, Jennings asked his classmates to consider whether a Harvard education was a privilege or a responsibility.
For Jennings, an education at Harvard was a mandate to help less-privileged people, he said.
To that end, Jennings went into teaching, though he said that he did not expect the field would allow him to fulfill a commitment to future generations.
CHANGING HISTORY?
Harvard has had an ambivalent history in LGBT issues. In 1920, there was a mass expulsion of gay students at Harvard.
And until the 1970s, LGBT students “lived on a campus that probably had a climate more akin to that of 1920 than that of today,” Jennings wrote in an op-ed for The Crimson in 2008.
But Jennings said that Harvard has made strides to better serve LGBT students. Jennings helped the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus raise $1.5 million to establish the first endowed professorship in LGBT studies in the country.
Still, Harvard has a long way to go, Jennings said.
According to Boone, Harvard has a difficult time knowing when it is behind. “Because it represents so much tradition it moves slowly,” he said.
Jennings noted that several universities have significant staff dedicated to serving the needs of LGBT students.
“It’s a little bit of an embarrassment” for Harvard, as well as an obstacle in recruiting talented LGBT students who do not perceive Harvard as being particularly gay-friendly,” Jennings said.
“There’s still a little bit of arrogance and the perception that, ‘We’re Harvard; everyone wants to come here,’” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, the city of Cambridge found itself without a mayor at the helm for nearly two months—showcasing the need for reforms to the election process to prevent the ship from running aground in the future.
As the City Council disagreed for weeks on end about which of the nine councillors would hold the post of mayor for the next two years, the city lingered without an elected leader.
Some say that the vacuum posed considerable problems for the city, while others contend that the mayor’s duties are not so significant that a vacancy in the spot is a major problem.
But many agree that such drawn-out complications should be curtailed in future mayoral elections to ensure that preventable delays do not disrupt the city’s smooth sailing—and civic leaders have proposed a variety of amendments to a clearly troubled selection process.
MAYOR, MAY I?
On the first Monday of the new year, five City Council members declared their aspiration to ascend to the top spot in Cambridge politics: Henrietta J. Davis, Marjorie C. Decker, David P. Maher, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, and E. Denise Simmons.
With more than half of the nine-member City Council signed up for the race, each candidate faced the daunting task of garnering at least five votes from their fellow councillors to be elected mayor.
At the end of that January night, Maher commanded a slight lead with three votes—an insufficient number to secure the mayorship.
“I’m ready to vote as often as I need to until we as a group can choose a mayor,” said council member Sam Seidel at that first meeting. “It’s going to take a lot more talking, and some more cups of coffee.”
The deadlock during the Council’s inaugural meeting would set the tone for the following two months.
Over the next four elections, Decker and Simmons announced their plans to run for a recently vacated State Senate seat and dropped from the mayoral race. As for the remaining contenders, Maher continued to hold a firm lead with four votes, while Reeves and Davis split the other five.
Despite the smaller pool, however, the Council was repeatedly unable to reach a consensus. During the sixth and final election—on Feb. 22, eight weeks after the initial ballot—Decker expressed a desire to expedite the sluggish process.
“We have to ask ourselves, if there is no mayor, and there are no committee assignments to chair, then what does the City Council do?” Decker said in a lengthy defense of urgency.
“We cannot effectively advocate for public policy,” she added.
Decker’s impassioned speech accompanied her motion to move the vote for the city’s next mayor to the top of the agenda.
That night, Maher seized six votes and the title of mayor of Cambridge. The Council then voted to make the result unanimous.
“Although the process seems a bit difficult, it is the process, and it is democracy,” said Simmons, outgoing Cambridge mayor, during the final meeting. “It gives us an opportunity to continue to discuss with each other in an informal context.”
ARE YOU MY MAYOR?
The mayoral position that was so hotly contested this winter comes with several responsibilities and significant compensation.
The mayor earns a salary of $105,025, almost $35,000 more than the other councillors’ $70,329 annual paychecks, according to Michael P. Gardner, the city’s personnel director.
In addition to chairing the City Council meetings, the mayor serves as chair and as a seventh vote on the School Committee.
But some say that the mayorship carries very little recognition—in fact, the delay in selecting a mayor had “practically zero” impact on the city, according to local political pundit Robert Winters.
“The mayor of Cambridge could be walking down any street in Cambridge and wouldn’t be recognized by most of the city,” Winters says. “It’s largely a symbolic position.”
But members of the School Committee point out that the sluggish mayoral race forced them to wait for the selection of their final committee member—the mayor—and thereby stymied their attempts to assign members to subcommittees.
“I think in some ways it had a profound impact because there were many significant issues...that were difficult to work on without knowing who the permanent chair was going to be,” says School Committee member Marc C. McGovern.
But he adds, “We did...a very good job of not letting that slow us down.”
Now that Maher has served on the committee for the past several months, School Committee members say that they are pleased with his contributions to the group.
“Mayor Maher brings the perspective of someone who once served on the School Committee,” says committee member Patricia M. Nolan ’80. “He’s a voice of calm and quiet leadership, which is really nice.”
MAYOR ADJUSTMENT
The turbulent history of Cambridge mayoral elections—coupled with what some view as inappropriate roles in the mayor’s job description—has led several elected leaders to call for change in the selection procedure.
“I am always a believer in more direct democracy, and this is not direct democracy,” says Nolan, who believes that the mayor should be elected by citizens in November when they choose councillors and School Committee members.
McGovern says that the City Council needs to give greater consideration to the School Committee when selecting the mayor.
“City councillors make their decisions on a lot of things other than who’s the best chair for the School Committee,” he says.
To remedy these issues, McGovern says that the School Committee should have a vote in the selection of the mayor, or it should choose a chair from any of its seven members in a selection process independent of the vote for mayor.
Simmons hypothetically suggests instituting a deadline by which the city’s leader must be chosen every year.
But Simmons reinforces the importance of the acting mayor as a fallback position. The role is always filled by the senior member of the Council—Reeves, in this year’s case.
This system, Simmons says, explains Cambridge’s ability to stay afloat for so long while it chooses a permanent captain.
This year was not unique in the difficulty of its mayoral election process. Since Cambridge adopted its current form of government in 1940, many of the biannual deliberations that have chosen new mayors for the city have been similarly tortuous.
In 1948, unlike this year, councillors took scores of votes each time they met, hoping to resolve the selection process as efficiently as possible. Despite these efforts, the election of Mayor Michael J. Neville required over four months and more than 1,300 ballots.
More recently, in 2000, councillors came to their decision in a six-and-a-half hour meeting on the night of Valentine’s Day, after a six-week impasse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the mid-1970s, a congressional investigation discovered that the Central Intelligence Agency was covertly funding hundreds of academic research projects—notably books—in the United States and abroad in order to counter Soviet propaganda efforts.
This discovery led to a change in regulations at Harvard, which, out of concern for academic independence, issued a set of guidelines in 1977 that required professors to report to the University if they were being funded by the CIA or other intelligence agencies.
According to this new policy, if the grants compromised academic freedom, the scholars would not be allowed to make use of the funds.
The regulatory change provided the backdrop for a scandal in 1985, when then-Professor of Middle Eastern Studies Nadav Safran was discovered to have received more than $150,000 of confidential CIA grants for academic purposes.
On October 10, 1985, then-Dean of the Faculty A. Michael Spence announced an investigation into Safran’s funding sources, discovering that he had received $45,700 from the CIA to fund a conference on Islamic fundamentalism without notifying the University.
The conference, which was scheduled to be held on October 15 and 16, 1985, at the Faculty Club, went on as usual. But many faculty members were “very unhappy” to learn about the questionable grants that funded the conference, according to then-Assistant History Professor Zachary Lockman, who is now a professor at New York University.
“We thought that [it raised] issues for scholars in general,” Lockman said, adding that “it needs to be clear that it’s not acceptable to take undisclosed funding from an intelligence agency.”
Thirteen of the 25 scheduled speakers boycotted the conference after hearing of the confidential funding. In fact, one of the professors returned to Cairo immediately after arriving in Cambridge.
Upon learning of the CIA funding, a participant of the conference, David Lelyveld, expressed his concerns over the confidential funding with regard to its potential impact on academic independence in a letter to Safran and The Crimson in 1985.
“The principle of the autonomy of academic inquiry is, I believe, seriously compromised by entangling it with the gathering of intelligence,” Lelyveld wrote.
At a time when the United States government supported then-Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who was described by The Economist as a “fundamentalist Sunni dictator,” it is even more important to be clear about academic independence, Lelyveld added in his letter.
But this controversy was not the end of Safran’s run-ins with other faculty.
Immediately after the disclosure of the funds Safran used for his conference, it was revealed that he also received $107,430 in April 1982 for another research project, which turned into a book in 1985. The book, “Saudi Arabia, The Ceaseless Quest for Security,” also neglected to mention the CIA funding.
Safran’s 1982 contract with the CIA said that the intelligence agency had the right to review and approve the book before its publication, and that its role in funding the book would not be disclosed.
Although Lockman said that he found the book to be unbiased, secretly taking funds from a government agency compromised the academic impartiality of Safran’s work.
However, a three-month investigation by Spence revealed that Safran did report his CIA funding to the FAS Dean serving before Spence, Henry Rosovsky.
Spence found the former Dean at fault for failing to respond to Safran’s disclosure. The Harvard University Press, which published Safran’s book, also found itself at fault since it did not call attention to the CIA funding when Safran informed the Press of this sponsorship.
Although Safran was in the end not reprimanded for receiving CIA funding for his book, the University found him responsible for failing to disclose his funding sources for the conference.
Subsequently, Safran resigned as director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies but retained professorship after the investigation, a position he held before retiring a year prior to his death in 2003.
According to Lockman, universities have not adequately addressed their links to government funding to this day, adding that educational institutions have to be careful about encouraging scholars to receive state funding and avoid any research agenda set by government agencies.
Today, government agencies are an important source of funding for professors at the Kennedy School, according to Kennedy School Associate Professor Matthew Bunn, who received funding from the government for his research on nuclear terrorism.
But currently, the University now has an extra layer of scrutiny and review, according to Kennedy School Professor Leonard D.B. Herman.
Acceptance of funding from government intelligence agencies now requires “aggressive disclosure” to the Dean, Herman added.
Further, the University has a contractual agreement with government agencies requiring the latter to respect the academic independence of scholars, according to Ashton B. Carter, professor of science and international affairs.
The agreement stipulates that government agencies have the right to preview the research and make suggestions before its publication, but they do not have the right to either suppress or modify the research. Moreover, the University considers the suggestions of agencies, but it does not make itself obligated to conform to them.
According to Carter, he has received more than two dozen grants from the government. Only once did a government agency try to pressure him into changing a manuscript, he said, because the agency did not approve of one chapter of Carter's report. Carter added that he reminded the agency of the University’s policy of academic independence. Eventually the report was publishedunmodified in the mid-1990s.
It is legitimate to receive funding from the government as long as government agencies openly support unclassified research, another Kennedy School professor, Joseph S. Nye, said.

Founded in 1935, Dudley House has always played a unique role on campus.
In 1985, Dudley celebrated its 50th anniversary. According to an introductory letter written in 1985 by the chairs of the House to commemorate the event, “The anniversary year is a special time for Dudley—it gives us the opportunity to glance back and to look forward in time.”
In retrospect, Dudley House has, indeed, filled a niche on campus since its inception, and according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who served as the resident tutor of Dudley House from 1992 to 2005, the role of Dudley House on campus has evolved continuously.
“Going back in time, Dudley House was much more of a commuter house,” Dingman said. “Now, very few of our undergraduates live at home, but in those days, it served an even greater purpose.”
In the 50 years after its founding, Dudley House became what the 1985 chairs of the House described at the time as unique.
“Dudley students are anything and everything but typical,” stated the 50th anniversary letter. “While members of other Houses come directly from the yard dorms and stay for three years, our students come from the surrounding Boston area, other Houses, other universities, and time-off from Harvard.  Some are married and many are graduate students.”
The different ways in which people have used Dudley House reflect the varied groups that the facility has served.  Many of the students that have enjoyed their Dudley House experience the most have been Dudley House Cooperative residents.
“I spent some time living in Quincy House as well, but compared to living on campus, living in the Co-ops was a much more relaxed atmosphere,” Steven D. Pizer ’85 said. “It was like leaving school and going home everyday, which was a nice thing to do.”
Yet being a member of Dudley House did not necessarily entail active participation in various activities held in Lehman Hall—Dudley House’s main building.
“There was a bit of a divide within Dudley House between people living on their own in apartments and people living in the Co-ops,” Pizer said.  “The Masters had their teas, there were intramural sports things, but most of us in the Co-op were not particularly involved in those things.”
For transfer students, being a part of Dudley House culture was not a choice but an obligation.
“It was hard to be a Dudley house student then—the Houses were more the center of social life than they are now,” said Jonathan A. Lieberman ’85, who had transferred to Harvard from Amherst. “Every House had its own personality because it wasn’t a lottery—it wasn’t random. It wasn’t that easy to be a transfer student. I was trying to make friends and feel like I was a part of the House community on the river. I did not have much of a feeling for Dudley House.”
Since 1985, the atmosphere has changed, as transfer students are no longer required to be affiliated with Dudley, and students living off-campus have been granted permission to retain their House affiliation if they have spent previous semesters living in another House.  According to Dingman, such changes have positively affected Dudley House and made the House smaller and more cohesive.  “The number of students who join in the events that the fellows host in the House have increased, and that leads to a really vibrant community.”
While the rules surrounding Dudley House affiliation have changed, the lifestyle has remained untouched.  “The best part about the atmosphere at Dudley House is the diversity of the people who are here,” said Jonathan R. Bruno, a current graduate student and Dudley House fellow.  “It’s a fun place to be, there’s a lot going on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my four years working at The Crimson, I have personally read and edited bushels of these parting shots. I say “bushels” because, like a farmer, I annually anticipate Commencement Week as a harvest of sorts. The crop of parting shots is fairly predictable, occasionally yielding some blue ribbon corn and always yielding a surplus of diseased squash. Someone will tell you the charming story of how they learned to love failure. Someone else will try to convert you to the Church of Teach for America. Everyone will lament the hours they spent in Lamont.
Most farmers, however, are never faced with the prospect of becoming the harvested—although that would make for an excellent sci-fi movie tagline. I knew I would have to get a head start in order to avoid the usual tropes, so about a year and a half ago, I sat down and wrote a fantastic parting shot. I was ready to submit it, but now it just feels a little out of place and artificial, like the Harvard Community Garden (the agriculture jokes are just getting started). So today, I’ve decided to throw it out and write from the heart instead.
Per unwritten law, all parting shots must include at least one John F. Kennedy ’40, Lawrence Summers, or T.S. Eliot ’10 quote. I’ve chosen one from the last, from “The Hollow Men.” Eliot writes, “Between the idea / And the reality / Between the motion / And the act / Falls the Shadow.” I am an economics major, so there is roughly a zero percent chance that I will interpret this quote correctly, but, hey, maybe this is my black swan. In my opinion, Eliot is describing a state we often find ourselves in at Harvard—a middle ground between the vague idea of who we want to be and the reality of how we present ourselves on a daily basis. Do we consciously choose deliberate action, or do we just go through the motions?
Suffice it to say that on the editorial board of The Crimson, I found a group in which, in order to participate, you are forced to define your politics and opinions. In each meeting, you are called on to vote in favor or against the opinion of the room. There is no middle ground: Every decision must be conscious, deliberate, and final. You cannot just go through the motions.
This finality filled a void for me, like a finality club. Otherwise, at Harvard, it is simply much too easy to live life in the shadows, to avoid conclusion. We simply nod and halfheartedly agree with most statements. Think about it: We are much more likely to agree than disagree with whatever is said to our face. It’s just easier. This phenomenon is well documented. In How We Know What Isn’t So, Cornell psychologist Thomas Gilovich describes the human tendency to surround ourselves with those people who are most likely to agree with our established opinions. The result is that we all simply nod and nod and become more and more convinced of our own correctness without ever actually stopping to define or acknowledge our own true opinions. The successive nodding is great for our neck-muscle definition.
This is a disastrous outcome, however, for our lives and for society. When everyone runs around patting each other on the back for their erroneous beliefs, we all end up with financial crises and cold breakfasts. From D.C. to Cambridge, we’ve all suffered due to the inaccurate convictions of our leaders.
The only available pesticide for such a threat is healthy debate. In his April 21 speech at Harvard, Bill Gates questioned why we are only willing to engage each other in genuine debate when the stakes are low. We will argue for hours about the merits of our March Madness brackets, but we rarely engage our friends in sustained debate about healthcare or education.
We have to learn to play devil’s advocate, to challenge the opinions of our friends, to debate for the sake of debate. Harvard has taught us well. We neglect this education through our continuous and unquestioning accession. Like all parting shots, the message can be neatly summed up with a one-sentence lesson I learned in third grade: Agree to disagree. And, like all parting shots, I will now make this moral seem much more brilliant than it actually is: Debate sows the seeds of democracy. See, the first two letters of each word are the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Harvard class of 2010: Congratulations on a wonderful achievement. As you reach this milestone, it is fascinating to reflect upon how dramatically the world has changed in just your lifetimes. There have been changes that even the smartest professors that I had at Harvard could not have predicted.
Many of these changes have been for the good. The Soviet Union disintegrated in a Christmas gift to the world, and the Berlin Wall fell without a shot being fired. Former South African President Nelson R. Mandela walked a remarkably peaceful path from prison to the presidency. Peace came to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement. The light of democracy swept across some of the darkest corners of the globe, and the number of democracies expanded from 69 in 1989 to 119 today. And if you still don’t believe that anything is possible, the New England Patriots won three Super Bowls, the Boston Celtics a National Basketball Association Championship, and the Boston Red Sox not one, but two World Series titles. As for the Bruins—well, we’ll hope for next year.
As positive as many of our advances have been, we have seen catastrophes as well. The tragedy of September 11 and the rise of global terrorism remind us of the fragility of peace in our time. Natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami demonstrate the abiding power of Mother Nature, even as we burn fossil fuels at rates that put us at grave risk of irreversible climate change. And our recent pullback from an economic abyss shows us the insecurity of our global economic system, which has raised many boats but still leaves over one billion people tragically living on less than $1 per day.
But our technological and scientific breakthroughs have also made possible new solutions to these problems. They are catalyzing educational, economic, and civic-democratic opportunities in previously unimaginable ways. The Internet has revolutionized everything from looking at pictures of your friends to presidential campaigns.
Clearly, you have come of age in a time of both tremendous opportunity and tremendous challenge. To confront these challenges, we need a new approach.
In the wake of President Obama’s election, however, most in Congress looked backward for inspiration. Many Democrats reverted to the New Deal philosophy of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, Republicans to the tax cuts and small government philosophy of former President Ronald W. Reagan. One side took refuge in ideas that were 75 years old, the other in ideas that were 30 years old. They are both out of date. They depend on the stale and discredited argument that you must be either for big government or against it, that government is either the solution to all problems or the cause of them.
It would be wiser to listen to President Abraham Lincoln, who said: “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present…As our case is new, we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.”
Our stormy present requires citizen activism. We shouldn’t look to big government or big business to create the solutions we need, but rather to big citizenship and a renewed sense of common purpose.
Big citizenship means contributing to a cause larger than your own self-interest. It calls on each and every one of us to perform community service, to get involved in politics, and to join with other citizens in larger movements for change.
It says we need to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in the public, private, and non-profit sectors to develop the new ideas and solutions we need to address the new problems we face.
Big citizenship calls on us to define a new catalytic and transparent role for government, one that ensures a level playing field, monitors performance, uses competition and choice, and rewards and scales up what works while recognizing and shutting down what doesn’t.
Big citizenship recognizes that we should forge public-private partnerships among all three sectors that can leverage the strengths of each to address our most pressing challenges.
Most of all, a new philosophy of big citizenship and common purpose demands that we move away from the old, misguided question of “Are you better off?” to the real question: “Are we better off?” We must reassert the spirit of our founding fathers and mothers who “mutually pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honor”—the spirit that we are all in this together.
You all, as Harvard students, have already demonstrated your commitment to service on campus. You have volunteered in record numbers through the Phillips Brooks House Association, you have found summer jobs through the Center for Public Interest Careers, and a record 14 percent of you applied to work for Teach for America.
Now, as you prepare to head out into the real world to create extraordinary lives, I hope you will continue to nurture that spirit of service in assuming what former President Harry S. Truman called the “highest office” in the land: that of citizen. It will be up to your generation, the first of the 21st century, to define and shape the new approach that will help us overcome the challenges and seize the opportunities of our times. So congratulations and carpe diem; the world both needs you and awaits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This January, I got the e-mail that every Harvard student fears—an ominous note from my resident dean requesting that we meet as soon as possible.
Theories raced through my head.  Did I forget to put quotation marks around a few sentences in an essay I had written? Or was it a benign invitation to a friendly discussion?
After subsequent entreaties, the dean revealed that he wanted to talk to me about “initiations for The Crimson” that had occurred in December. I had just wrapped up my tenure leading The Crimson a few weeks earlier and thought I was out of the woods when it came to administrative inquiry and punitive measures. Evidently not.
In advance of the meeting, I frantically tried to figure out what purported offense at “initiations” had been committed and what my involvement had been. The Crimson welcomes over 100 new members to 11 different boards every semester in a celebration we call “Grand Elections,” so it was a daunting task to track down what might have piqued the Administrative Board’s interest.
After heavy investigation, I came up with one lead. Many of The Crimson’s boards ask their newly elected members to accomplish optional good-natured “missions” as part of the fun of elections day, which often include scavenger hunts, love poems to editors, and song-and-dance routines. The news board, in what most would consider fairly harmless fun, asked some of their members to get Hallmark greeting cards signed by someone in the registrar’s office.
One member brought flowers and chocolates along with his card in hopes of currying favor with the office workers.  He was instead approached by the manager and told that he was performing illegal solicitation. The manager then apparently filed a formal complaint with the Ad Board, alleging “disruption of the work day.”
As the meeting approached, though, I couldn’t bring myself to believe I was going to get Ad Boarded for a greeting card—I was sure it was some other issue of which I was unaware.
My dean, surprisingly, had not been informed as to the specific “charges” he was meeting with me about.  He had been tasked with obtaining more information regarding the structure of The Crimson and the nature of Grand Elections.  I would have to wait to find out what incident was at the heart of the matter.
Later that night, I got the news that I would be meeting with Jay Ellison, Secretary of the Ad Board, about the CVS card.  I was in shock.  Was I going to be suspended because The Crimson supposedly “disrupted the workday” at the registrar’s office with some flowers and chocolate?
Dean Ellison was surprisingly good-natured, despite my fears. He noted that the Ad Board was investigating the issue and had not decided whether or not to make it a formal case.  He asked me some basic questions and sent me on my way. I did not know whether to be relieved or more worried.
Over the course of the next several weeks, several of my peers went through the same process, including the managing editor, the associate managing editors, who run the news board, and the leaders of the election process on the news board.  The uncertainty and fear of Ad-Board retribution weighed heavy on our minds for weeks.
We were never told what the final outcome of the case was, but since I have not heard anything yet, I will assume it was thankfully dropped.  But this episode, for me, has served as emblematic of my dealings with the College administration.  As with many other issues, they were deeply upset by what seemed—to me, at least—to be inoffensive fun.
This semester, the College administration is out in force again, coming after The Crimson for egregious offenses like having new members sing “Cupid Shuffle” while wearing mouse ears in front of the John Harvard statue.
The Crimson perhaps takes an undue amount of heat because it elects such large numbers of people, and, obviously, I have only been exposed to the administration’s actions toward one organization.  But this shakedown is endemic of a deeper problem with the College’s wars on perceived hazing and underage alcohol consumption. In focusing on “low-hanging fruit” like The Crimson’s innocuous semesterly celebration, Deans David R. Friedrich and Suzy M. Nelson of the Office of Student Life squander time and money regulating celebratory, fun events highly unlikely to create any liability for the College. They also possibly miss some of the more serious offenses occurring behind closed doors, in organizations that are much smaller or not officially affiliated with Harvard.  My friends joining final clubs and other semi-secret organizations, for example, were effectively kidnapped for weeks at a time during their initiation.
This is not to say that I personally take issue with these longer, more involved types of induction processes, as my friends in other clubs seemed to greatly enjoy their initiations. For me, Grand Elections at The Crimson was one of the most enjoyable days I had at Harvard.  As long as an initiation process is voluntary and legal under Massachusetts hazing law—which we were always careful to follow to the letter when I led The Crimson—the College should avoid getting involved in any organization’s activities.  To be clear, all new members of The Crimson are told with complete sincerity multiple times before and during Grand Elections that they may opt out of any activity or the entire day with no repercussions.
The law defines hazing as any conduct which “willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person…[including] whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics...forced consumption of food, liquor, beverage, drug or other substance,” all of which I can say were fully avoided by The Crimson.  Presenting flowers, chocolate, and greeting cards do not make the list of offenses considered “hazing,” and certainly do not represent any potential liability for the College.
The random, unexpected dealing out of punishment by the Ad Board and the deans breeds fear and, ultimately, lack of respect.  If giving President Drew G. Faust a fake check for $1 billion—which we did during a previous Grand Elections and she said she found amusing—is allowable but presenting the registrar’s office with a Hallmark card is an offense worthy of months of investigation, there is no real way to know, as a student, where lines are drawn.  Thus we are faced with two options: accept the risk of suspension for every “greeting card” or forego Grand Elections entirely.
Based on my dealings with the administration and recent events, it seems that the College’s new attitude is more and more reminiscent of the cantankerous and unreasonable Dean Wormer from “Animal House,” who was ready to put wayward fraternities on “double-secret probation” without cause. The Crimson was far from a Delta House-esque nest of iniquity and hazing, but the fact that we are frequently being treated as such makes me think that the College is wasting time and resources in policing innocent events that many participants rate as some of their favorite undergraduate experiences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 8:45 a.m. on the morning of Jan. 3, 1949, Lamont Library opened its doors for the first time. The building had taken two years and $2.5 million to construct, which apparently went to good use—on the day of Lamont’s ribbon-cutting ceremony, The Crimson bragged that the box-like red-brick structure set a “new mark in functional design.”
The library, which had first taken form in the minds of Boston architect Henry R. Shepley, class of 1910, and Harvard University Library Director Keyes D. Metcalf more than a decade earlier, charted new pedagogical territory: It was the first in the United States designed specifically for undergraduate use. Lamont’s open alcoves, innovative (for its time) card-catalog system, and plentiful reading rooms made it particularly well-suited to house the academic endeavors of Harvard College’s industrious student body. Contemporary observers were so impressed that local businesses took special efforts to highlight their association with the new development—the Sikes Furniture Company, for example, proclaimed with pride in an advertisement (which now sits on display in Lamont’s basement) that its “seats of knowledge” filled the library’s reading rooms.
Over the course of the building’s history—which includes memorable moments like the “Great Burrito Riot” of 2005, when 1,500 undergraduates stormed the library in hopes of snagging free Felipe’s promised by the Undergraduate Council—Lamont has come into its own in ways that its founders hardly could have imagined. It now serves as the epicenter of Harvard academic life, the site of countless nights spent preparing papers and problem sets.
At some point in his or her career, almost every Harvard student comes to the building to learn in it. But, as the regular patrons discover, there is much to learn from it as well.
Lamont houses everything from an impressive sheet music collection to an assortment of antique telescopes. Its walls are adorned with colorful exhibits honoring the winners of Philip Hofer Book-Collecting Prizes and the photography competitions sponsored by the Office of International Programs. On the third floor, you can find a literary map of Cambridge, highlighting spots like Weeks Footbridge—the site of Quentin Compson’s suicide in The Sound and the Fury, (Faulkner wrote that Harvard was a place “where the best of thought clings like dead ivy vines upon old dead brick”). Alongside it stands a display on Harvard’s poets, which chronicles the lives of Eliot, Frost, Lowell, and Stevens, and reveals that Gertrude Stein did not, in spite of the popular myth, receive an “A” for writing that it was far too nice a day to take an exam on the final for a William James-taught psychology seminar.
More than anything else, though, the library teaches us about the students who call it home. Lamont embodies the ethos of Harvard better than any other place on its campus. It is the school’s foremost temple to its reigning ideology—the Protestant ethic expressed in the Biblical admonishment: “See thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before Kings” (Proverbs, 22:29).
This sanctification of labor permeates Lamont, where Harvard students, hounded by the insatiable need to stay busy enough to deserve their privileged place in the modern meritocracy, combat fears of inadequacy through righteous striving. In the library’s confines, undergrads complain about work even when they have none, as if terrified by the prospect of idleness. For, as Max C. E. Weber wrote, in capitalist society, the waste of time is “the first and in principle the deadliest of sins.”
Of course, it is ironically also one that Lamont’s denizens perpetrate incessantly. As the library’s detractors are quick to note, the cavernous ceilings and high windows of the Ginsberg Reading Room bear witness to more chatter than study—a problem that only grows worse in the Café, which is, truth be told, less a social space within a library than a social space within a social space.
But in this putative weakness lies the strength of numbers. Misery loves company, and is abated by the silent camaraderie of a library filled with similar (albeit trivial, in the grand scheme of things) suffering.
This idiosyncratic functionality was pithily put into words by Harvard librarian Heather E. Cole, who, when asked about the library’s peculiar role as a social center, responded, “I think people make of Lamont what they need to.”
The library and the community it sustains emerge in response to the central anxiety of Harvard life: the failure to measure up. Under Lamont’s 24-hour fluorescent lighting, no one need bear this ponderous burden alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I had 11 roommates over my four years of Harvard, none of them for more than a year. That makes me sound rather dysfunctional, but I prefer to see my roommate roulette as a function of transferring Houses while taking a year off during college. That’s what I tell myself, anyway.
Sophomore year, I was a floater in Quincy House, meaning that I was randomly assigned to complete another rooming group. I landed with a group of three close-knit girls in a two-bedroom apartment in 20 DeWolfe Street, the building of campus envy because it had cable television and, more importantly for me, a kitchen.
Two roommates were, like me, native New Yorkers. But the third, Ali, was a 5’10”, blonde-haired, blue-eyed varsity basketball player from a rural town in Western Pennsylvania with no stoplights.
We shared a bedroom, but we maintained an air of formal politeness, of “So how was your day?” queries as we were brushing our teeth. She was fair and strikingly tall, especially in heels. My growth spurt as a Chinese American had been all of two inches between 5’0” and 5’2.” I balanced The Harvard Crimson and an applied-math concentration. She was literally a Gov jock. She was the only one in her high school ever to come to Harvard. My competitive New York City high school sent 11 kids to Harvard my year alone. She was so white it seemed almost ethnic.
But the kitchen became the common space to bridge the strangeness between Ali and myself, a place lit by harsh fluorescent lights where our aloofness slowly broke down.
When we first met, Alison had never tasted sushi or dumplings. She was fascinated with the strange packages with squiggly writing I brought back from my shopping trips to Chinatown. The first time she caught a whiff of the pungent smell of pickled Korean kimchee, she winced and thought to herself, “Something is wrong with this.”
Ali came from the “Good Housekeeping” school of domesticity: fluffy yellow cakes, sun-dried tomatoes, and Parmesan cheese.
I corralled her into folding dumplings with strict instructions: Don’t make the dough wrapper too soggy; don’t put too much meat filling or you will not be able to close it up. She helped me and my friends make 800 pieces of sushi and 300 dumplings for a pre-frosh welcoming reception. In turn, she taught me about the Super Bowl (she was a Steelers fan) and helped me fill out my first (and only) March Madness bracket.
But the kitchen also provoked some tension. Ali was used to having a sparkling-clean kitchen after and between each and every meal. At my house, there was a never-ending cycle of pots, pans, and woks on the stove. When my mom finished cooking lunch, she would immediately start cooking dinner. And the rice cooker was always on, if not in cooking fresh rice then in keeping rice from the last meal warm. Cooking was a continual process, of defrosting or marinating and soaking. The concept of a kitchen that could be turned on and then off was completely foreign.
But I adjusted.
Cooking together provided us comfort as we rode the emotional turbulence of college-girl careers: the crushes, the bad grades, the hangovers, the awards, the post-teenage angst, the team politics.
One day during spring break we drove out to Walden Pond and spent the afternoon taking photos—a refuge away from the stresses of campus.
We made dinner for ourselves that night. She made angel-hair pasta and salad with homemade croutons. I made stir-fried beef with rice. On impulse, I threw in some of her sun-dried tomatoes into the pan with the beef and red peppers. We laughed, and it was surprisingly good—worth an appearance on Top Chef one day.
For her 21st birthday, I bought a black wooden folding picture frame with spaces for two photos. I carefully selected a picture of Ali and one of me from that afternoon at Walden Pond. In the photo she is laughing and looking away from the camera with her head jauntily tilted towards the sky. It is completely unposed, one I took when she wasn’t ready.
Of the pictures we took that day at Walden Pond and throughout our sophomore year, not a single one was of just us together. Only that wooden frame holds us both.
It’s been almost more than 14 years since we were roommates. She’s kept that frame even though the glass has cracked. Today Ali works in New York City as a hedge fund headhunter, pulling in a seven-figure salary in what, on the surface, seems a Sex-and-the-City lifestyle. Sushi is now a regular part of her urban diet. She eats kimchee with relish, having embraced its fermented essence.
Of the 11 roommates I had, Ali and I started the furthest apart, yet she’s the one to whom I’m closest today. I’m certain it’s because of that kitchen.
Today we gossip and commiserate via instant messaging and text messaging. She comes to the Sundance Film Festival with my friends. We watched the Super Bowl at her place last year, where she went all out. Ali makes great chicken wings. Maybe I’ll learn how to make them from her someday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the best day in the Middle East, being a minority is a real challenge. Most face social, political, and economic hurdles, but their religion provides them with a buffer to survive social pressures, discrimination, and limited opportunities.
The majority of the Druze lack this comfort. Their holy book, known as the Book of Wisdom, is not easily accessible nor is it comprehensible to the layperson. I would have to give up every aspect of my life to become a “sheikha” and be covered up from head to toe in dark clothes with a long white veil before any “sheikh” would read and explain the Book of Wisdom to me. This is not an option for me or for any Druze woman today.
As a result, I turned to human rights as a religion. And here is the loss: When the educated Druze woman and future mother cannot find solace in her religion, religious leaders need to assess priorities and introduce options in line with modern times.
“If you have a precious diamond, do you leave it in the public hands?” the Druze sheikh would always ask.
As religious leaders continue to hide the diamond, the secularization of the Druze community puts at risk the loss of a religious identity that embraces all religions, emphasizes the premise of reason and rationality enshrined in Greek mythology, and represents a progressive sect in the Middle East.
The Druze religion has roots in Shiite Islam. In the past, the Druze feared extermination for breaking away from Islam. Unfortunately, religious leaders have maintained this psychology of fear to silence the youth who are perplexed by all this secrecy at the outbreak of the 21st century.
Most of the young Druze generation today suffers from an identity dilemma. Unlike Islam and Christianity, where you can go to religious schools or institutions to be taught the Koran or the Bible, Druze religious authorities have forbidden the circulation of the Book of Wisdom, and only a pious Druze (known as a “sheikh”) has the privilege of reading the holy book alongside “sheikhs” who understand it. This has led to widespread acceptance of the ignorance of the faith.
With such a void in our religious education, it is difficult to imagine what connects a Druze in Lebanon to a Druze in Israel, Syria, or Palestine—even though the Druze were originally found in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel/Palestine. At the same time, the Druze religion represents a progressive break from Islam in all countries, since the Druze man is forbidden to marry more than one woman, and the institution of marriage is based on equality between men and women.
Despite all challenges, there is a deep sense of pride in being a Druze. Given that the Druze faith is based on different religions, including Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism, it is a real loss to allow this unique religious identity to wither. It is estimated that there are approx 1.5 million Druze worldwide, but there are no reliable updated statistics or population-trend analyses studies that can educate us about the future survival of the Druze as a community.
The survival of the Druze community and faith compels further research. The establishment of a Druze library is a critical starting point. Preserving relics such as books, articles, manuscripts, and photos will ensure the protection of Druze religion, history, culture, and heritage. At Harvard, we need to think about developing a minorities program to conduct research, organize events, and collect minorities’ heritage in our libraries.
The international community can help preserve the identity of minorities by learning more about them, and funding important initiatives. There is a need to fund projects that connect the Druze with their ancestral brethren in Syria and Israel/Palestine. It is also unclear whether the Druze have historical or spiritual roots in China and India.
Ultimately, the survival of the Druze will largely depend on the young Druze educated professional class and their ability to establish an international committee to reform the tenets of the Druze faith that are in conflict with modern times.
Even the most precious diamond needs to be polished now and then, or we risk losing it forever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently an alumna said to me, “I know what we’ve done in my company to respond to the challenges of a down economy, but I’m guessing that an institution like Harvard has almost none of the same levers to pull. And yet, you’ve made some big changes. How do you do that without significantly altering the nature of the place, the things that make Harvard Harvard?”
Her comment highlights that, beyond the need to adjust to a new financial reality, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has very little in common with the private sector. FAS is a place that thrives on a productive sort of chaos, and we are known for our highly decentralized structure. But like the commercial institutions that successfully weathered the global financial crisis, we embraced change.
Through the efforts of our entire community, we were able to make many changes for the better, and I am proud to report that our commitment to our core mission of teaching, learning, and research has only become stronger. A Harvard education, for both our graduate and undergraduate students, remains an experience unparalleled in its richness.
So what changed? Over the past 18 months, we have made prudent, structural adjustments to position FAS for a future of long-term, sustainable excellence. From enhancing academic planning to reconfiguring the functions that support our students and faculty, FAS has become a place driven by its academic priorities.
In addition, the recent rise in unrestricted giving has been a powerful engine for FAS during the financial storm. These generous gifts made an enormous difference in our ability to maintain our financial aid programs, continue essential services for our students, and launch new initiatives based on the most promising ideas of our faculty.
Although the past year has been defined by a renewed sense of institutional discipline, this discipline did not diminish our vibrancy or preclude new efforts to advance our mission. Next year will begin with a faculty projected to be slightly larger in size than in the past. The incoming graduate-student class will also be slightly larger than the last, and it boasts the highest admissions yield in recent history. Similarly, the yield in the College will exceed last year’s mark of 76 percent. The College and FAS continue to attract the world’s most outstanding faculty and students.
We have not retreated from what we know is important. In the upcoming academic year, Harvard College will increase financial aid for undergraduates by nine percent, to a record $158 million. This $13 million increase will help keep Harvard affordable and ensure no change in the cost of attendance for the students who receive aid (i.e., for more than 60 percent of our students).
We have not slowed our intellectual evolution and growth. Next academic year will launch a new undergraduate concentration, biomedical engineering, and two new secondary fields, one in ethnic studies and one in global health and health policy. These come on the heels of our very successful introduction this year of a new concentration in human developmental and regenerative biology. Our newly launched Program in General Education, which replaced the 30-year-old Core Curriculum, also continues to expand, with 331 courses already approved.
In some cases, the crisis was the impetus for new programs. It gave rise to the College Fellows program, which brought 22 fantastic young scholars to campus to teach our undergraduates and to further their professional development. As of today, eight fellows have secured tenure-track positions around the world.
While we did give up some things over the past 18 months, Harvard remains an environment of unique depth and breadth. For instance, in FAS we offer instruction in more than 70 ancient and modern languages, far more than any other American university. No language programs were eliminated because of the financial crisis. In fact, we moved forward; this year we launched new “bridge” courses that integrate language instruction (such as Arabic and Chinese) into literature and other content instruction.
Harvard undergraduates continue to be deeply embedded in the transformative, cutting-edge research and scholarship of our faculty. Our students become engaged in forging new discoveries and new ways of thinking in fields that bear on the world’s foremost challenges and opportunities, from renewable-energy policies, to stem cell science, to human rights. Our identity as an undergraduate college at the heart of a thriving research university informs every aspect of Harvard’s approach to a 21st century liberal-arts education.
It is hard to express just how proud I am of the way in which FAS faculty and staff have come together to make the past 18 months successful for our students and to ensure continued growth and enrichment for the institution as a whole. In doing so, we have used this time to plant seeds of greatness, and we will reap the benefits of these efforts for many seasons to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Week was a blast. A cruise, a wine tasting, a luau, a trip to an amusement park, a soiree, and a BBQ were just some of the events on the agenda. The class of 2010 had a fantastic time, and the Senior Class Committee deserves kudos for organizing such a fun week. I think, however, that Senior Week should have included a day of public service to balance out all of this fun.
The truth is that the Senior Week schedule reflects a tension internal to the Commencement process. On one hand, many of the Commencement speakers will talk about the tremendous capacity that the class of 2010 has to serve our communities, our country, and the world. We will be praised for our strengths and encouraged to use our gifts to improve society and humanity. At the same time, most of the class of 2010 already have their plans for next year locked up. If the past is any indication, many Harvard seniors will be taking competitive, individualistic, and personally rewarding jobs next year. And how many seniors are committed to volunteering for public service after a long, stressful day of work? The Commencement ceremony will urge seniors to make the world a better place, but most seniors have already chosen to focus on personal betterment.
There’s nothing wrong with personal betterment. Every individual has the right to work hard to pay off student loans, to live comfortably and support a family. But it’s not right for these personal aspirations to be our only ones. A good, moral life balances personal goals with communal ones. Yes, one should work toward a career that is personally fulfilling, but one should also work to help others, to better one’s community, and to “serve better thy country and kind.” What’s crucial to life, when properly lived, is balance.
The Senior Week schedule does not reflect the proper balance, and, as a consequence, it sends the wrong message to our graduating class. How seriously are we to take exhortations toward public service after we’ve spent a full, Harvard-funded week eating, drinking (a lot), and enjoying ourselves? Yes, many of us have worked very hard in college, and, of course, this is our last chance to spend time with many of our friends. But how about a little bit of balance?
The perfect way to balance Senior Week would be to add a day of service to the list of activities. The class of 2010 should have spent one day applying our muscle to soup kitchens, parks, or schools throughout the Boston area. It would have been a day full of symbolic and educational significance. It would be symbolically significant, because it would represent Harvard’s commitment to public service. But it would also be the perfect way to cap off a Harvard education in a way that’s consonant with the institution’s professed values.
It is too late to organize this for the class of 2010. So, to the class of 2011—how about it? When you plan your Senior Week activities next year, consider whether all of the parties and celebrations perhaps focus a bit too much on the self, and not enough on others. Consider also whether the week represents what a Harvard education is really all about. Please consider scheduling a day of service as part of the Senior Week activities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Reserve Officer Training Corps commissioned 11 Harvard College graduates as officers in the U.S. armed forces at a  ceremony yesterday, attended for a third year by University President Drew G. Faust, who said she hopes for a stronger relationship between the University and the military.
While not commenting directly on the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy—which bans homosexuals from serving openly in the military—Faust seemed to allude to the policy when she asked the recently minted officers to “help reinforce the long tradition of ties between Harvard and military service, as we share hopes that changing circumstances will soon enable us to further strengthen those bonds.”
In recent years Harvard has had a strained relationship with the military, stemming from its decision to ban ROTC from campus in 1969—a ban that the University has continued out of opposition to the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy.
But in her adress yesterday Faust repeatedly emphasized the University’s strong connections to the armed forces that predate the controversy.
President Barack Obama has said that he plans to repeal the policy, meaning that ROTC might be able to return to the Harvard campus. Currently, students at the University who participate in ROTC must commute to MIT to train.
Faust’s decision to speak at commissioning ceremonies has garnered strong reactions from both sides of the issue. ROTC graduates said yesterday that they felt supported by Faust—who also gave them a book by West Point instructor Elizabeth Samet about teaching literature through war and peace.
“During my time at Harvard, President Faust has really reached out to us,” said Sarah A. Harvey ’10, who was commissioned yesterday as a second lieutenant in the Army. “Every cadet and midshipman has appreciated what she has done.”
Yesterday’s events included a swearing-in ceremony at Tercentenary Theatre, preceded by a private ceremony in front of the John Harvard statue. There, cadets whose family members are officers in the military could swear in the newest members of the armed forces.
Christi E. Morrissey ’10—who comes from a family with three generations of military officers—was sworn in yesterday by her brother, a fellow officer and Harvard graduate who also participated in ROTC.
“It feels a bit like joining the family business,” she said. “It’s a very special moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Class of 2010, you begin your futures with quite a past.
When you appeared for freshman registration in 2006, five years to the day after 9/11, President Bush was declaring us “safer” if  “not yet safe”; the Dow was climbing toward its all-time high; and the world was rumbling along, or so it seemed, toward eternal prosperity. It was a world in which growing proportions of Harvard seniors were set to join Wall Street or consulting firms, a world of relatively secure jobs and high-paying careers, a world that was your oyster.
Then came your junior year, and suddenly there was no script. The world had shifted. It was the year of Obama. Who could have anticipated that? It was the year of entropy, with catastrophic floods and fires, an imminent flu pandemic, and the biggest meltdown of world financial systems since the Great Depression. Jobs you had counted on evaporated. Opportunities vanished. Phrases like “bailout” and “too big to fail” were suddenly being applied to companies you had hoped would someday recruit you. And the University was not immune. We didn’t have to melt down the roof of Harvard Hall into bullets, as in 1775, but we did curtail plans, and you watched, unsettled, as last year’s seniors felt their way onto a shaky economic landscape.
Now the economy has steadied a bit, and the word “recovery” is in the air, even if we are not confident about its strength and pace. Yet this heavy dose of disorientation is an inescapable part of these extraordinary recent years. What have we learned that can serve us in times of calm or crisis?
Let me suggest four particular lessons of these upheavals that I hope you will carry with you.
The first is about humility. In case we didn’t know it before, we have been forcefully reminded that we cannot control, or even predict, the future or what it will require from us.
The unforeseen events of the past two years have forced us to imagine the world differently; they have demanded that we adapt and throw away the script we thought we were following. And they have reminded us once again of the value of the liberal arts, which are designed to prepare us for life without a script. Since you cannot know what you need to be ready for, we have tried to get you ready for anything.
The second lesson: Embrace risk—it is inescapable. You worry, I know, about the burden of Harvard, about “the pressure to be extraordinary” within a narrow definition of success, as one of you told me. “What will I say at my fifth reunion?” you wonder. What is “extraordinary enough”? It is, quite simply, having the courage to write your own script. You can be a risk taker. In fact, as we have learned, you will be a risk taker whatever you choose because no choice is guaranteed to be safe; no path is risk-free. So do what you love—whether it is law or drama, finance or physics, or, as one of you told me during Arts First, heading off to Los Angeles to play the Delta blues guitar. Life is long. Don’t settle for Plan B until you have tried Plan A.
The third lesson: The world really needs you. Bill Gates reminded us of this when he visited a couple of weeks ago. We must, he said, have the world’s best minds working on the world’s biggest problems. But you knew that already. You have developed an enhanced sense of both opportunity and responsibility. You are choosing careers and lives that reflect an outlook and an urgency derived in no small part from what has happened in the world since you arrived in Cambridge less than four years ago.
And the fourth lesson: Living in a world without a script demands and rewards creativity. You need to be the authors, the entrepreneurs, of your own lives. Columnist David Brooks wrote recently of a process he called “leading with two minds”—the balanced influence of people who can be, as he put it, “practitioners one month and then academic observers of themselves the next.” “The ability to create knowledge and put it to use is the adaptive characteristic of humans,” Professor Louis Menand has observed. “It is…how we change—how we keep our feet on the ground and our heads in the clouds.”
If any class knows how to do this, it is yours. It is what the world’s crises, and your liberal arts education, have trained you to do. Keep asking the big, irrelevant questions; keep thinking beyond the present. Then live what you have learned.
In 1966, Robert F. Kennedy ’48 addressed a gathering of South African students struggling to end apartheid. “Like it or not,” he told them, “we live in interesting times. They are times of danger and uncertainty; but they are also more open to the creative energy of men than any other time in history.” This message is just as forceful and meaningful here today as it was in South Africa nearly a half-century ago, although now he would say women and men. That particular script, that time of uncertainty, had an inspiring ending; apartheid was destroyed. Now you have your own uncertainties and dangers and your own scripts to write. The world has never needed you more. And we send you into that world with full confidence in your commitment and in your ability to create scripts from the unexpected for which you are so well prepared.

The Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies has laid out plans to adopt a more interdisciplinary focus as the renamed Department of South Asian Studies—a move, if approved, that professors hope would attract more concentrators and faculty affiliated with other departments.
If the proposal—discussed at a departmental meeting earlier this month—is approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in the fall, the department will draw from other departments like anthropology, history, religion, folklore and mythology, music, and archeology to expand its current faculty from eight to 15 professors, according to Sanskrit Professor Michael E. J. Witzel.
The change would also allow the department—which had only three declared undergraduate concentrators this past year—to offer a wider range of courses under a single department and possibly specific tracks within the concentration in the future.
Given current financial constraints—FAS has yet to close at least a $35 million budget deficit—Witzel said that the department would likely wait to bring new hires from outside Harvard.
“These days, you cannot really ask for new positions,” Witzel said.
The change in departmental structure was initially slated to take place this spring, but details of the plan were not finalized in time for an official vote at this year’s final Faculty meeting, according to Witzel.
“It has been on the books for quite a while. It just needed the right definition and the right push at the right moment,” said Witzel, who joined the department in 1986 and served as chair in the early 1990s.
Witzel added that South Asia’s increasing global presence has prompted the department to reevaluate its academic focus on the region.
Offering over 70 ancient and modern languages, Harvard boasts one of the most comprehensive university language programs nationwide, but Witzel noted that his department’s language courses are currently limited to Sanskrit, Tamil, Thai, Urdu-Hindi, Nepali, and Tibetan.
“It is like Europe missing all the romance languages,” Witzel said. “There are big gaps in the programs.”
Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies Diana L. Eck will serve as interim chair next academic year while current department chair Leonard van der Kuijp is on leave.
“Having a wider study of south Asia at Harvard is something that many generations—or at least one generation- have yearned for,” Eck said. “So we think this is a really positive development.”
The study of Sanskrit began at Harvard in 1872 when it was established as an elective for Latin studies. It was folded into the Department of Indo-Iranian Languages later in the decade and assumed its current name in 1951.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Tuesday in the fall of 1960, a group of six students gathered in the  living room of Winthrop resident tutor Robert P. Wolff ’54. There, along with Sociology Professor Barrington Moore, they would discuss the likes of Marx, Freud, de Tocqueville, Nietzsche, and Durkheim.
“It was just two professors in a living room going at you for two hours—it was very heavy stuff,” said Wolff, then a philosophy and general education instructor. “When Moore was done with them he’d pass them off to me. The kids were just plastered up against the wall. The first week’s reading was the ‘Wealth of Nations.’ We were insane.”
The meetings in Wolff’s living room marked the beginning of what is now one of the most popular concentrations on campus, Social Studies. In 1960, 15 students in three tutorials embodied the realization of a plan for an interdisciplinary and comprehensive concentration that had been years in the making. While the program has flourished over the years, some complications and doubts surrounded its formation.
AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION
Initially, many of the departments that the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies sought to integrate—such as Government, History, Economics, Anthropology, Philosophy, and the now discontinued Social Relations department—had qualms about the addition of a new concentration that could steal some of their best professors and brightest students.
“It’s a traditional and universal fact of the higher education system in America,” said Wolff, who became the concentration’s first head tutor. “The creation of departments means that existing departments might lose students, and they use those statistics about majors to justify their funds.”
Stanley H. Hoffmann, government professor and one of the founders of the committee, admitted that Social Studies did indeed take many of the brightest students on campus from other departments, but he insisted it was necessary.
“People want to get out of little boxes,” Hoffmann said. “You cannot separate politics from the study of history or economics. Equations and models are one thing, but human beings are another.”
However, professors and administrators continued to push back, fearing that an interdisciplinary concentration would simply be far too broad to keep up with the academic standards Harvard demanded.
“The departmentalization of academia was a 19th century idea,” Wolff said. “The notion that sociology was separate from history or history was separate from politics or economics would have struck the people of the 19th century as nuts. Marx wouldn’t have thought that. Durkheim wouldn’t have thought that.”
Students saw the breadth of the concentration as a distinct advantage. “It was great, broad, and it meant that I didn’t have to narrow myself,” Charles A. Stevenson ’63 said. Stevenson, a member of Wolff’s first tutorial, returned to co-teach Social Studies’ international relations junior tutorial from 1968 to 1970. “It kept more options open longer. My mind got stretched by my sophomore tutorial more than any other experience at Harvard.”
Current Social Studies Director of Studies Anya E. Bernstein said that the concentration has always been personalized. “Students follow their individual academic paths, and they get a lot of support in that process,” Bernstein said.
INITIAL CHALLENGES
While Social Studies was able to borrow senior faculty from other departments, the committee as a whole has struggled to build a solid and lasting base of professors. In its first 40 years, not a single junior faculty member received tenure from the committee.
“It is a strength and weakness that the department has attracted so many junior faculty members,” Hoffmann said. “In my opinion there are not enough senior members teaching.”
“Instead they are submerged in their department or sitting on review committees,” he added.
SAME THINKERS
Despite such struggles, Hoffmann said he is pleased with his vision as it exists today.
For the first two years, social studies tutorials did not count towards academic credit, so students had to take them in addition to their full course load.
The original concentrators could choose between three focus fields: International Relations, Problems of Industrial Societies, and Problems of Developing Societies. In 2005, a review committee decided the focus fields—which by then had evolved to be Industrial Societies, Developed Societies, Social Theory, International Relations, and Culture and Personality—were too broad, Bernstein said.
The class of 2010 will be the first concentrators to graduate under the new system, which allows students to design a specific focus field  that must pass through a review process. Bernstein said most focus fields combine
an issue and a region—for instance, Education in Rural America.
Remarkably, the tutorial-based structure and syllabus has changed relatively little in the 50 years Social Studies has been a part of the University.
While students today might not have to read the whole of “The Wealth of Nations” in a week, they still gather to discuss the classics of social theory in hopes of accumulating a wide range of tools to analyze their surroundings.
“In fact, just a few years ago we had a T-shirt contest and the winning slogan was, ‘Social Studies: changing the world in 30,000 words or less,’” said Bernstein, referring to the maximum length of a Social Studies thesis. “We are dedicated first and foremost to inquiry and the passion to understand the world and engage with it.”

On Tuesday, 99 new members were formally inducted into the Harvard chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s oldest academic honor society.
Following the election of the Junior 24 last spring and the Senior 48 in the fall, the newly elected seniors round out the Phi Beta Kappa membership of the class of 2010.
“I was already very excited about graduation and the events associated with it,” R. Cameron Parker ’10 said, “so in a way [being elected to PBK] was icing on the cake.”
Tuesday’s ceremony began with a chapter meeting in Harvard Hall, where the new members were formally inducted into the organization. The meeting was then followed by a formal procession to Sanders Theatre for the annual Literary Exercises.
During the Exercises, teaching prizes were bestowed on three professors—Lawrence Buell, Benjamin M. Friedman, and Richard J. Tarrant—who had been nominated by graduating seniors elected into Phi Beta Kappa. Eight individuals present—including five members of the class of 1960 and poet D. A. Powell—also received honorary membership.
History Professor Ann M. Blair ’84, president of Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter, said that highlights of the ceremony included Powell’s reading of his poem “Panic in the Year Zero,” which he had written for this event
“There were interesting links that came through different parts [of the ceremony], such as friendship,” Blair said.
This spring’s group of 99 new members is the first to be elected under the revised selection process. According to the new requirements, which were implemented in April, prospective members are not informed of their candidacy and are not asked to submit an application or letters of recommendation.
Betty Y. Zhang ’10, who was selected this month, said she favored the new process.
“I got an e-mail one day telling me that I was elected into PBK, and I was pleasantly surprised instead of [previously] going through the application,” she said. “No one got a rejection or anything.”
Zhang said that her favorite part of the induction ceremony was being able to experience it with her roommate, who had been previously elected.
“It was one of our last moments here together at Harvard, so that made it even more enjoyable that we were able to share it,” she said.
Parker said that becoming part of a historical organization like Phi Beta Kappa was a humbling experience.
“It’s always a great privilege to be joining something that is several generations old, feeling a connection with students who were here two centuries ago,” he said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 27, 2010
An earlier version of the May 27 news article "Phi Beta Kappa Welcomes 99 New Members" incorrectly stated that seven members of the class of 1960 received honorary membership at the ceremony. In fact, not all of these individuals were from the class of 1960.

For the average Harvard student, life is an endless cycle of classes, sections, meetings, practices, and study sessions that cause the days to turn into weeks that, in turn, become months. Over time, this cycle adds up to four years, during which prizes are won and resumes perfected, but all too rarely do we stop to participate in perhaps the least-practiced activity on Harvard’s campus—doing nothing. Looking back over my college career, I can’t say that my time on campus hasn’t been positively influenced by my participation in activities and classes. But as much as any lecture or activity over the past four years, my experiences with idleness have greatly shaped my time at Harvard.
In particular, one of the most memorable afternoons in my recent memory did not take place in a classroom or with a team, but instead took place on the grass outside of Memorial Church. There, for upwards of six hours, a friend and I sat with no purpose whatsoever. Occasionally we would watch tourists engage in far-too-racy public displays of affection right in front of us or friends shout out to each other as they pass through the Yard en route to yet another meeting. We even gathered up the energy at one point to drag ourselves to Chipotle, a decision we later regretted. For most of the time, however, we just sat and talked. It was probably six of the least productive hours of my Harvard career, but also six of the most memorable. Sure, neither of us bolstered our resumes that day or accomplished anything worthy of a prize, but that afternoon still sticks out as one of my best of the past four years.
Undoubtedly, some will reject any suggestion that they engage in the active pursuit of idleness, especially here at Harvard. As students, it seems that we feel that, unless we are late for one activity while typing a response paper on our BlackBerry, we are lacking purpose. For many, idleness represents a waste of precious minutes better spent involved in yet another campus activity. But without those purposeless moments spent with friends on the banks of the Charles River, I would not have been able to appreciate the significance of my other activities here over the past four years. Indeed, the very act of doing nothing is what reminds us that doing something is fulfilling. If we, as students, spend all of our time running from activity to activity, we fail to see where our true passions lie. Moreover, we run the risk of burning out by the time we reach graduation, rendering our time here at Harvard useless.
Doing nothing has been one of my greatest pastimes over the past four years, and I unequivocally endorse its practice to those students who have yet to embrace it. Before you graduate, make sure to find those activities on campus that make you happy and those subjects that interest you, but also make sure to find time to do none of the above. These respites from busyness and thinking may seem like a waste of time, but when you look back upon graduation these will not only stick out as some of your most memorable moments, but will also make you appreciate the importance of everything else you’ve done at Harvard. And so, the next time you find yourself with an afternoon free of commitments, don’t worry about what you could be doing. Instead, find yourself a spot to do nothing for a few hours. And when you’re done with that, get back to the real world.

The History Department announced yesterday its plans to reduce the number of half-courses required to graduate by two, granting concentrators more flexibility in choosing courses.
In an e-mail to the department’s 233 declared concentrators, Director of Undergraduate Studies and History Professor Daniel L. Smail wrote that the department will now require 10 half-courses to graduate and 12 to qualify for honors.
The move—which will be in effect for the class of 2013—is coupled with a policy change that will limit concentrators to a maximum of one related-field petition to receive history concentration credit for other departmental courses.
Rising juniors and seniors will have the option of graduating under the new requirements.
“We hope that you will accept this invitation to explore the rich array of history courses that are taught in many departments at Harvard,” Smail wrote.
Since the Faculty of Arts and Sciences extended the deadline for undergraduates to declare their concentrations to sophomore fall, the History Department has seen an increase in the number of related-field petitions as concentrators had to seek credit for related courses that they had already taken, History Lecturer Trygve Van Regenmorter Throntveit ’01 said.
By reducing the number of requirements, Throntveit said, history concentrators would have more flexibility to take courses outside the department.
History concentrator Antonio J. Hernandez ’10-’11, who took a year off, said that the change will give him the necessary flexibility to complete his coursework in one semester.
“It’s like finding $20 in your back pocket,” he said. “You could do without it, but it’s nice that you found it.”

It has been nearly 75 years since Harvard undertook a new series of ambitious outreach efforts to encourage talented students from all backgrounds to come to Harvard. With a record 30,000 applicants to Harvard this year, it is clear that we have made much progress. Today, people across America, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, or economic circumstances realize that Harvard is within reach. Harvard has been in the forefront as higher education has opened its doors, and America now has a much greater chance of playing a leadership role in the world for generations to come.
The democratization of Harvard goes back to its founding and Anne Radcliffe’s gift of Harvard’s first scholarship. Over the centuries, other efforts followed, with increased financial aid and more effective recruiting. With the commencement of the National Scholarship Program announced at Harvard’s Tercentenary celebration in 1936, President James B. Conant, class of 1914, committed Harvard to broaden such efforts in ways not imagined previously.
This effort was also driven by half a century of work by the Admissions Office to identify, recruit, and admit talented students of all backgrounds. Among the first National Scholars was Fred L. Glimp ’50, a proud Idaho native, whose visionary leadership as Dean of Admissions from 1960-1967 provided considerable momentum for this work. Chase N. Peterson ’52 from the state of Utah served as dean from 1967-1972 and led minority recruitment to new heights. And L. Fred Jewett ’57 from Taunton, Mass. ushered in the current era, urging Harvard to reach out to all talented students, including those from the rural areas that produced Glimp and Peterson.
The structure they put in place has been continually adapted to new opportunities, and it supports our work today. Now 12,000 Harvard alumnae and alumni work throughout the world to encourage students to consider Harvard, and they interview applicants to assist the Admissions Office in selecting each year’s entering class. Our modern tools include the Internet and other technological innovations.
Today’s financial-aid program would astonish previous generations of Harvard alumnae and alumni. Over the past six years, the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative has led to a 33 percent increase in the number of students at Harvard from families with incomes less than $80,000 per year. More middle-income students are also applying to Harvard now: For 90 percent of the American population, Harvard is no more expensive—and, in many cases, is less expensive—than flagship public universities. This is a powerful message about the accessibility and affordability of today’s Harvard.
Recognizing that this message has never been more important to Harvard and to our society than it is in today’s difficult economy, President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to our strong financial-aid program without hesitation even during the most challenging early days of the financial downturn. While the current generation of Harvard students will be forever grateful for their leadership, we will see even larger benefits in the years ahead as this new financial-aid program slowly but surely changes long-held views that Harvard and institutions like it are accessible only to the already-privileged. Such fundamental changes in public perceptions of institutions often take a generation or more.
People ask why Harvard continues to recruit despite having so many applications. We do so because many talented students remain unaware of their opportunities. Among the many structural barriers to opportunity is an average student-to-counselor ratio in our nation’s public schools of 500 to one, in some states nearly 1,000 to one. Because these high-school counselors are overworked and under-resourced, it often falls to us to convey the message of accessibility and affordability that has led to the new Harvard.
Our efforts to open Harvard’s doors have succeeded. In the mid-1960s, Harvard had a four-to-one male-to-female ratio, fewer than half the number of scholarship students we enroll today, and only a sprinkling of minority and international students. To return to the past by limiting our recruitment efforts would relegate Harvard to a greatly diminished role in developing the talents of all of our citizens.
Harvard has benefited throughout its history from many initiatives designed to democratize its student body. The unparalleled excellence of today’s students can be maintained only by vigorous, imaginative, and sustained efforts. If Harvard is to remain a national and world leader, we must continue to seek new ways to find talent in all its forms. We hope our graduating seniors will join us in this mission wherever they go and whatever they do in the years ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of 1960 Harvard alumni shared their thoughts on the future of the arts and their personal relationship with the field at a symposium for fellow graduates yesterday afternoon.
Fielding questions from moderator Joseph W. Zeigler ’60 in Sanders Theatre, a sculptor, a music critic, a playwright, and an arts trustee extolled the liberty fostered by the arts.
Paul P. D’Andrea ’60 said that the freedom experienced in playwriting translates into “a source of joy in one’s life.”
“That’s joy, and if the writer does a good job, it will be a joy for the reader or the audience,” he said.
But that freedom does not come without several forms of support.
Having travelled across Europe to conduct research on female composers, Cecelia A. H. Porter ’60—a critic for The Washington Post—said that her ability to reap the benefits of art was supported by her family’s encouragement.
And Jose A. Buscaglia ’60, a sculptor who has worked in Venezuela, emphasized that full artistic freedom required basic necessities like decent living conditions and freedom of thought.
Audience members—most of whom were 1960 graduates—shared their opinions and asked questions about the revolutionary nature of art.
In the final minutes of the symposium, one audience member asked if the art world is undergoing a “planetary renaissance.”
“I’d like to think that newness is inevitable,” said Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, the chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. “I think it’s almost tautological.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the families of graduating seniors and members of the classes of 1960, 1975, and 1985 strolled around Harvard Square, a group of about 30 University employees, students, and sympathetic locals gathered outside the Holyoke Center yesterday evening to protest layoffs and the alleged abuse of temporary workers at Harvard.
Chanting “Hey, Harvard, you should know, temp abuse has got to go,” protestors said that they demanded justice for Harvard’s temporary workers—claiming that the University refused to give them unionized jobs after a period of work, as stipulated by their contracts, to avoid giving them union benefits and wages.
Former Harvard temporary worker Dennis Prater told his tale of abuse through a bullhorn, claiming that he was cycled through three different categories of temporary employment for over a year in the Gordon McKay Library so that the University was not obliged to provide him with a permanent job and union benefits. After a year, he was laid off.
With no severance pay, Prater said that he “learned the many uses for a hot dog because I couldn’t buy more expensive food.”
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Representative Geoff Carens called Prater’s story “one of the worst contract violations that I’ve seen at Harvard.” Carens, who helped organize the protest, is part of a leftist core group of about 10 union members known as “Reform HUCTW” that has often advocated for more drastic reforms than the union at large.
Protestors said that they chose to hold the rally yesterday to attract the attention of the families of graduating seniors and alumni attending reunions in Cambridge.
“It’s the day before Commencement, and we want the families of graduating students and the alumni that are here to know that their education at Harvard is in a state of dire emergency,” said HUCTW member and accounting assistant Phebe Eckfeldt, referring to the University’s budget cuts and subsequent layoffs in the wake of the financial crisis. “We as Harvard workers cannot provide adequate and quality services if we are facing speed-ups because of layoffs, if we have to do the jobs of three people instead of one.”
The protest also came in the middle of HUCTW’s eighth round of contract negotiations with the University, which both University and Union leaders have said are particularly difficult this year due to the financial climate.
Still, HUCTW members said they are hoping for a raise in their wages.
“The University is going to try to nickle and dime us,” said Jeffrey Booth, a Harvard College Library assistant who has worked at the University for 23 years. “But we need a raise to keep up with the high cost of living in the area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Walter B. Schubert is CEO of The Schubert Group and founding member and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. He is a third generation member of the New York Stock Exchange with more than 20 years of experience on the trading floor of the Exchange.
First, it was "Reform Wall Street." Then it was "Reform the Financial Services Industry." And all the while, where were the voices shouting for a closer look at the regulators? More than the laws, the industry, or the pavement of Wall Street, the real institution that needs to be reformed is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. When I was asked by a senior member of the House Committee on Financial Services about Mary L. Shapiro’s appointment to the chairmanship of the SEC, I simply said that she was the sergeant at the donut shop while Bernard "Bernie" L. Madoff absconded with old ladies’ pensions. She’s another card in an old deck of the dysfunctional world of financial regulatory oversight. If I sound cynical, it’s because I have been around Wall Street and the financial-services business for over 35 years. And nothing ever changes!
The SEC is the front line in efforts to defend those old ladies from the Madoffs of Wall Street. As an enforcer of the Federal Securities Laws, a reformed and effective SEC would be apolitical and better able to respond in a 21st century manner to regulatory infractions, while addressing and changing outdated rules that hurt America’s competitiveness. Today’s regulatory regime must be replaced. It is ineffective in policing the market and holding people accountable. It must institute common-sense rules, conscious of a rapidly changing landscape that would put America, and our financial marketplace, back in a competitive position within the global markets.
History has shown that nearly every attempt by the SEC to change or introduce an important new rule has been politically and emotionally charged thanks to entrenched SEC staff members who have been asleep at the switch for years, or commission members who are beholden to political interests. Sadly, as a result, many a needed reform takes years to move forward and go into effect—if at all.
The SEC has always been ruled by commissioners appointed by the president. There are four commissioners, two Republicans and two Democrats, and a chairperson. The incoming president chooses two commissioners from his or her party. Once the commission is formed, the inevitable political bickering begins, with nary a beneficial outcome to Wall Street or Main Street.
To those who deny that there are serious flaws with the current procedures for determining commission members, I ask that they seriously consider that the majority of important commission votes have ended up strictly along party lines—three-to-two or two-to-three. Most recently, the vote to bring suit against what President Obama has implied as the center of all evil on Wall Street—Goldman Sachs—broke down to a vote of three Democrats against two Republicans. It was blatantly obvious to everyone that the SEC was politically motivated to bring this suit now so as to move the financial reform bill forward in the Congress. Whether true or not, that’s the perception—and we all know that people buy and sell stocks all the time based on perception and rarely on the reality. On the New York Stock Exchange we’d say, "Buy the rumor, and sell the news." The perception that Goldman Sachs and many, if not all, of the investment banks on Wall Street are crowded with evil, greedy people fuels a perception that leads to a cancerous cynicism and the erosion of confidence. The American capital markets, which are based upon trust and confidence, hang in the balance. Standing on their own, laws don’t instill trust and confidence. Laws with competent and fair enforcement do engender market vitality, confidence, and trust.
Today’s SEC is too political and a fiendish meritocracy. Underpaid and undereducated, the SEC staff and enforcement personnel must bring home the bacon to headquarters, or their jobs are on the line. (Was Shapiro’s deciding vote against Goldman intended to make up for her sin of oversight with Madoff?) The SEC staff, like the traffic cop at the end of the month, must meet a quota for writing tickets—or, in effect, they must find some dirt on the companies they examine, whether it’s there or not.
There was a time when the regulated worked with the regulators as partners, in the spirit of assisting the regulated to operate within the rules and more effectively. In those days, a first infraction merited a warning, a second infraction for the same offense got you a ticket and maybe a fine, and a third infraction led to stiff fines and much more serious consequences.
The above is not the case in today’s enforcement practices on Wall Street. Today, an SEC examiner comes to do an audit with a preconceived notion that there is something illegal happening. Then he or she finds something that isn’t illegal, forms the perception that it is illegal, and ties up the firms and the SEC’s legal apparatus for years. The only people getting rich here are the lawyers.
Our elected officials and regulators would have us believe that we can regulate the greed out of the markets. I promise you that it’s never going to happen. But what we can have is a shift to a corporate culture in which employees at any firm who see dishonorable behavior known to be illegal or not in the best interest of the firm are encouraged, if not rewarded, to bring their concerns to the compliance department or the company’s office of legal council. This is critically important to restore a code of honor and ethical behavior in these companies where the temptation to succumb to greed is all too great.
Beyond this, America needs an SEC that is independent and not politically motivated, with a staff that is well-educated and knowledgeable about the Securities Laws. Accepting this, I believe we have a chance at building an enforcement and rule-making regime that gives America the best chance to compete in the global capital markets of the 21st century.

I’m going to miss this place. Almost nothing anyone told me about Harvard has been accurate. "You’ll be surrounded by attractive men who want to take you out to expensive meals and share your opinions about Proust!" "You will get on the Lampoon instantly, expending no effort!" "You will love the hot breakfasts!" "The person who lives in Natalie Portman’s old room will be easy to befriend and not think it’s weird when you come try to use her shower as a shrine!"
The only piece of good advice I received before coming here was from someone who told me to sign up for Business School studies immediately. "You can make up to $40 in under an hour!" (The website for this, incidentally, is http://www.hbs.edu/cler/current.html.) "Then get a real job," the person added. "You can’t get job references if your only employment experience consists of pretending to be a banana-export czar in a simulated negotiation." ("But my son is pregnant!" I told my negotiation partner. "You can’t expect me to fire him!" I lost the negotiation, by which I mean that I conceded absolutely every point, but I think I gained valuable expertise.)
My own expectations were more specific. I always assumed that Harvard was a giant edifice made of red bricks and the bones of pilgrims, where my roommate would be named Quentin Compson and would leap off a bridge to his death shortly after meeting me. I was only half-right.
Still, I have very few complaints, the only big one being that the dining-hall services stopped serving scrod on a regular basis after I sent them a heart-felt letter telling them how much I enjoyed it. Sometimes I think about it and start coughing violently with emotion, usually because I am forgetting to swallow something else that I am eating at the time.
The thing that has puzzled me most in my time here is why most of the toilets lack lids, or whatever you call that thing that covers the seat. I have a private theory that whoever designed Harvard dorm furnishings had strong moral objections to people sitting down, which explains why all the chairs gang up on you whenever you try to lean back, but I don’t know why he would have wanted fecal coliforms all over everything in the restroom. Maybe he had one as a pet and got attached.
Now, on the verge of graduation, I hope that the real world is like Harvard, mostly because I really like paneling and former fireplaces that are now just confused-looking bits of wall. I also enjoy falling asleep when old, distinguished men are telling me things, and I worry that my opportunities to do this post-graduation, say with my hypothetical future father-in-law at barbecues, will be limited.
But mostly I enjoy having a wealth of academic opportunities. Not in the classroom, of course but in talking to my peers. I have a friend named Kyle who is literally a walking Oxford Classical Dictionary, which is wonderful, because I hate carrying my Oxford Classical Dictionary to Starbucks. "Critic and commentator Kenneth Dover was so impossibly prolific!" Kyle says, sometimes, before people seize him by the dust jacket and shut him with excessive force.
People always said that the best parts of Harvard were the wonderful intellectual conversations that you would have. So far, I have yet to have any of these wonderful intellectual conversations, but I take comfort in the knowledge that the people I spend most of my time making cat noises with could, if called upon, discuss Nietzsche intelligently.
And that’s the thing about Harvard. When I graduate, I know that the Harvard name will brand me regardless of what field I try to enter, possibly because I have literally branded the words "Harvard Class of 2010" on my forehead. But it will have been worth it.
People often tell me that their college years were the best years of their lives. Admittedly, some of these people live in that area outside of the Coop and spend all day sitting in one position holding a cardboard sign with grammatical errors. But if Harvard has taught me one thing, it is that you should always be polite to the people who try to instigate conversations with you at Starbucks, because you will wind up running into them a year later, and they will remember everything you told them the last time about your imaginary sister Eve who ran away to the big city with a luggage salesman.
But the best part about Harvard is not the three extremely proximate Starbucks locations, the glorious libraries, or those people in section with unclear genders. It is something more elusive: the feeling of not being the smartest person in the room. Whenever I am not at Harvard, I make a point of surrounding myself with the cast of "Jersey Shore," so this is not nearly as pretentious as it sounds. But whether it’s in the classroom, listening to someone eminent and white-haired lecture about something, or in your dorm room, discovering all the things your friends know about everything from classic rock to actual rocks, the sensation of being with people who can teach you all kinds of things is absolutely delightful. Also, the large number of places that take Crimson Cash, including but not limited to Uno’s, Boloco, and Broadway Market, which sometimes allows you to buy wine with it.
I would like to say that I regret nothing of the past four years. Actually, I do regret one thing: not having donated one of my eggs to those people who advertise in The Crimson, because, hey, that’s serious money. But then I worry that my kid would be raised by people who think it’s okay to advertise for eggs in a college newspaper.
So maybe that worked out.

Susan N. Herman is the president of the American Civil Liberties Union.
On his second day in office, President Barack H. Obama issued executive orders to end torture and close Guantánamo within a year, signaling a commitment to restoring the rule of law and upholding American values and the Constitution.
Unfortunately, nearly a year and a half later, the administration has not only continued some disreputable Bush-Cheney national-security policies, but has also added new ones. For us at the non-partisan American Civil Liberties Union, this is a continual reminder that no matter who is in office, civil liberties need vigilant protection.
Guantánamo itself may well be closed in the near future, but of course this will be an empty gesture if we just create a "Gitmo North" at the Thomson prison facility in Illinois or anywhere else—or if we continue to buy into the idea that we can engage in indefinite detention without fair hearings.
Some people ask whether terrorists should have rights. But there is no way to tell who is a terrorist and who isn’t without some sort of fair process. Mohammed Jawad, for example, was shipped to Guantánamo at the age of about 16 and held for almost seven years despite the lack of any credible evidence that he had been involved in any form of terrorism. Before turning him over to the Americans, the Afghanis who captured him tortured him, threatened to kill his parents, and got him to sign a confession written in a language he did not speak by affixing his thumb print. There are far too many other examples of unjustified detentions.
The Obama Administration has decided to use military commissions to try some of the Guantánamo detainees and has even suggested that it might reverse Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr.’s decision to try the 9/11 suspects in federal criminal courts. Our nation’s criminal justice system is more than capable of trying terrorist suspects (unlike the unproven military commissions). We should not be trying some of the most important terrorism trials in our nation’s history in a make-it-up-as-you-go-along commissions system.
Despite an immense amount of public evidence about the involvement of Bush-era officials in torture—including thousands of pages of documents and photographs secured through ACLU Freedom of Information Act litigation—the Obama Administration has thus far failed to hold a single one of those officials accountable for breaking the law. President Obama has said we should just turn the page, but we cannot move forward until we look back, discover how our highest officials chose a path of torture, and hold them accountable for atrocities committed in the name of the American people.
Victims of extraordinary rendition—the practice of kidnapping and transporting people to countries where they were tortured in secret without even being charged with a crime—have initiated lawsuits challenging well-documented and horrific abuses. But Obama’s Justice Department is arguing the same "state secrets" privilege the Bush Administration employed to have entire cases thrown out. As a result, not a single innocent victim of the torture program has had his day in court. Much of the conduct at issue—like the participation of the Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen DataPlan in the rendition program—has been fully aired in the media. The only place where that conduct is treated as secret is in the United States courts.
Recent reports indicate that the current administration has authorized targeted killing of people—including U.S. citizens—far from any battlefield. Conducting a program like this without any checks and balances, but instead according to secret rules and with no publicly-disclosed limits, invites abuse and a climate of impunity. It is simply not enough for the executive branch to say "trust us" when it comes to putting U.S. citizens and others on kill lists, but that is exactly what the president is doing.
An acquaintance recently asked me to tell her what the ACLU was doing. "But don’t tell me about that Guantánamo stuff," she said. "Why should I care about those people when they aren’t even Americans?" There are many other areas where the ACLU defends the rights of Americans in ways she found compelling. Just take a look at our website and you will find examples like Nick George, the Pomona student who was arrested, handcuffed, detained, and questioned for nearly five hours at the Philadelphia airport because he packed his English-Arabic flash cards to study on the plane back to school; Constance McMillen, the Mississippi student who was not allowed to attend her high school prom with her girlfriend; people who worry that Arizona’s new law will lead to their being stopped and questioned by officers who think they look foreign-born; and thousands of others. But I hope you can answer her question about why we should care about "that Guantánamo stuff," whether you cite the rule of law, the American tradition of leadership in human rights, or just the Golden Rule.
One excellent way to show you care is to join the ACLU—the student group if you’re in school next year, or by giving yourself a graduation gift of a membership. As our motto says, "Because freedom cannot protect itself."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While growing up in Brooklyn, Mary I. Bunting-Smith’s mother would sometimes tell her, “Thee is a funny little girl.”
This statement would prove to be prophetic. Educated at home until the eighth grade, Bunting-Smith went on to pursue traditionally male-dominated disciplines, receiving an undergraduate degree in microbiology from Vassar College in 1931 and a Ph.D. in bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1934.
“I grew up believing, gratefully, that the doors of educational opportunity in this country were wide open,” she said during an address to Southern Methodist University on Jan. 28, 1966.
Bunting-Smith continued her career as a microbiologist, teaching and conducting research at Bennington College, Goucher College, Yale University, and Wellesley College before serving as dean of Douglass College. In 1960, Bunting-Smith became the fifth president of Radcliffe College and the third woman to hold the position.
“She was very no-nonsense. She didn’t look like she spent all of her time putting on her make-up and doing her hair,” Mary H. Metz ’60 said. “Her very appearance and demeanor was serious. She was validating the idea of a woman who was serious.”
For Bunting-Smith, the dearth of women in intellectual, social, and political arenas was “a curious thing.” In a 1961 address to The University Women’s Forum in Philadelphia, she said educated women were underappreciated.
“Their high ability has been amply demonstrated in our schools and colleges, but this has seemed to carry little commitment on their part, or interest on anyone else’s in their later higher achievement,” she said. “Rather we all seem to be content to let them serve as intellectual pace setters, useful during training but not expected to run in any important races.”
During her first year in office at Radcliffe, Bunting-Smith began to overturn this prevailing attitude about women’s education, implementing policies that increasingly integrated Radcliffe with Harvard and encouraged female students to be leaders outside the home.
“CLIMATE OF UNEXPECTATION”
Although Radcliffe women had begun attending classes at Harvard after a 1943 agreement formally instated joint instruction, some female students prior to Bunting-Smith’s inauguration said that they felt they were not full members of the Harvard community.
“Women were marginal, seriously marginal,” Metz said. “We were not allowed to step inside Lamont Library because we were thought to distract the men from their studies. That meant that you had to go back to Radcliffe dorms after class, and then you had to go to the Radcliffe library if you wanted to study. You were really separated from the men.”
Metz added that this sentiment permeated her interactions with faculty members, as few made themselves available to assist the women enrolled in their classes.
“I remember one humanities professor that I had who was wonderful,” Jill Kneerim ’60 said. But when a male friend asked him about her, the professor responded, “Well, she’s sort of that junior-league type.”
At the time, Kneerim didn’t know what it meant, but she said that it “really shows that there just weren’t that many ways to think about a young woman who was outspoken.”
Although Metz said that her dedicated senior year tutor helped her with her thesis and eventually inspired her to become a sociologist, he was a rare exception among the teaching staff. “There were very few faculty members who didn’t treat their female students like afterthoughts,” she said.
While some women felt that they were considered a lower priority than their male counterparts, some Harvard students said they disagreed.
“I don’t think that most of the men thought that they were at two different colleges,” Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60 said. “While Radcliffe undergraduates couldn’t go to a lot of places that today would seem outrageous, there were places at Radcliffe that we didn’t particularly go to either.”
But Metz said that most people do not realize that the quality of a Radcliffe education was affected by the way the institution was structured.
“By the way that things were set up in Radcliffe, we were being trained to be good hostesses,” Metz added.
She said that during meals, about nine people would sit at a round table, and they were expected to make conversation with each other. When students came to clear the tables, everyone was expected to leave.
“It was wonderful training for making small-talk as a hostess, but it was lousy stimulation for intellectual conversations,” Metz said. “Men would sit at tables of two to four and talk for hours.”
CHANGING ATTITUDES
Bunting-Smith had a very different idea about women’s education. As she stated in a 1966 address to Southern Methodist University, higher education should “provide freedom and backing for those of identified ability and high motivation to move as their talent takes them.” Universities, she said, “must seek to develop the potentialities of people in all segments of society,” an idea that is implicit in the concept of democracy.
Bunting-Smith spoke openly about the unfortunate disparities in the way that society viewed education for men and women—a mindset that she hoped to change.
In the same address to SMU, she said that “there was a real difference in the way most adults talked to little girls and little boys about their futures and in the expectations of their teachers in school and college.”
This widespread attitude, Bunting-Smith argued, was one that had to go.
“Universities in this country have found it convenient to prejudge women’s potential contribution for leadership,” she said. “What I ask is that they experiment.”
THE NEW EXPERIMENT
When Bunting-Smith arrived at Radcliffe in early 1960, her actions and perspective departed from those of the previous president, Wilbur K. Jordan.
“Mary Bunting came in during our last semester. We hardly got the opportunity to see her, but it was such a morale-booster to have her show up,” Metz said. “Her predecessor was just kind of sleep-walking through the role. She came in full of energy and affirmation and really cheered us on.”
Bunting-Smith adopted a role that was unusual for a Radcliffe administrator. At her president’s residence on Brattle Street, she often left her porch illuminated in the evenings to let Harvard and Radcliffe affiliates know that they were welcome to come in to speak with her—a tradition that she carried over from her time at Douglass College. She also showed her appreciation for the Radcliffe maids by inviting them to a formal tea in her home.
“She was very supportive and welcoming to the women on campus,” Susan T. Friberg ’64 said. “I had a decision to make as to whether or not to accept advanced standing. My mother contacted her and asked her to help me with the situation. President Bunting then invited me to her home to speak to me personally. I thought that that was a very good thing.”
Bunting-Smith also implemented a number of institutional changes that she believed would improve the quality of education for her female students—even if, as some people feared, these new measures would cause the distinction between Harvard and Radcliffe to break down.
“I don’t come to Radcliffe with a preconceived notion that the right way to do things is with Harvard or without Harvard,” Bunting-Smith told The Crimson in 1960. “But I do feel Radcliffe is obligated to offer the very best educational opportunities and if this can be done through Harvard, then that is the way it should be done.”
Among the changes advocated by Bunting-Smith was the affiliation of Harvard Houses with Radcliffe dorms, the first of which were between Quincy House and Holmes and Comstock Halls. These affiliations were aimed at raising the level of what Bunting-Smith called “dinner-table education” at Radcliffe. They also granted women accessibility to scholarly conversations with professors and research assistants that had previously only been granted to male students.
Men in many Harvard Houses, Kneerim said, had the opportunity to dine with junior and senior faculty members. But Radcliffe women had “keepers” who watched over them in the legal role of parents.
Kneerim said that she and her classmates were “all keenly aware” of these inequalities. “Surely we were all deeply affected by the fact that there were no women in leadership,” she said. “You can imagine how extraordinary and marvelous it was when suddenly Radcliffe had a woman president [again]. It was an exciting revolution.”
Bunting-Smith’s most enduring legacy remains the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, which allowed women to return to their studies even after they married and started families. Bunting-Smith believed that women could maintain their traditional roles as mothers while assuming a place in the workforce.
In her 1961 address to the University Women’s Forum, Bunting-Smith said that a woman’s expected role as a wife and mother should not prevent her from joining the workforce—rather, educational institutions should be expected to cater to her unique needs.
“The Radcliffe Institute was certainly a big step in helping women scholars whose careers had been interrupted to do scholarly work with the support of the Institute,” Metz said. “I know that that was one of her first projects, and it was seen as a big step forward for women during that period.”
AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE
Although Bunting-Smith’s tenure predated the emergence of the women’s rights movements of the late 1960s and ’70s, many Radcliffe alumni became actively involved after they graduated.
“We were breaking the ice out there for daughters who came along and the granddaughters who are entering universities now,” Kneerim said. “I have seen so many phenomenal changes for women. We were decorations in the past.”
Metz says female students should now to turn to Bunting-Smith as an example of the life that they should attempt to lead.
“Celebrate the accessibility of the university now. You need to realize that you’re standing on the shoulders of people like Mary I. Bunting who worked very hard and made many sacrifices,” she said. “Women do have a somewhat different life trajectory because of their gender. Different cultural patterns exist and that is fine. There doesn’t have to exist a contradiction between being an excellent professional in a given field and being feminine. Women now should honor both.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spring of 1960, 1,359 members of the Harvard faculty signed a petition encouraging the Eisenhower administration to consider banning nuclear testing in the United States, according to a Crimson article from May 16 of the same year. The petition, which was telegraphed to Washington, preceded an upsurge in student and faculty interest in arms control that continued into the decade.
According to the Crimson article, after 24 faculty members signed the petition, it was mailed to about 4,000 Harvard Corporation appointees, which included consultants in addition to faculty members. Ninety percent of those who responded added their names to the petition.
TESTING FALLOUT
Throughout the 1950s, the United States had conducted a series of nuclear tests, most of which initially occurred underground. Concerns arose when some larger weapons were tested in the open atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. On March 1, 1954, a Japanese fishing boat was exposed to nuclear fallout, killing the captain and wounding the other 22 crew members.
According to History of Science Professor Everett Mendelsohn, who said he had supported the faculty petition, the concerns about testing were twofold. “One was that the increased input of radiation into the atmosphere could be harmful,” he said.
Physics Professor Roy J. Glauber ’45—who said he did not remember the faculty petition—also said that testing thermonuclear weapons could be dangerous.
“The thermonuclear weapons were generally tested in the open air, and that was subjecting everybody downwind from them to the danger of fallout,” he said. “And when I say downwind I mean high altitude winds that carry the cloud clear around the globe several times.”
According to Mendelsohn, “the second and most compelling” argument for a test ban was that nuclear testing increased tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was also testing nuclear weapons at the time. Mendelsohn said each nation would respond to the other’s tests by trying to do something “bigger or better.”
“If testing went on, it seemed inevitable that other countries would get their own nuclear deterrents,” he said.
SEEDS OF ACTIVISM
For some Harvard students, the appearance of the petition in the spring of 1960 barely caused a stir.
“In the early 60s, the issue didn’t loom large in student life,” Mendelsohn said. “I’d say for many students, nuclear testing was somewhat esoteric.”
An article printed in the 1960 Commencement supplement of The Crimson made note of the relative lack of political activity on campus, calling students “uninspired.”
But according to Todd A. Gitlin ’63, arms control had become a “roaring issue” by that fall.
October brought the first meeting of a new student group called Tocsin—a word meaning “alarm bell” that has also been a code name in several military nuclear strike events—whose primary activities involved spreading awareness and promoting the fight against nuclear arms and testing.
“It sort of appeared on the Harvard scene out of nothing. It literally was created and became very prominent and very influential,” said Peter C. Goldmark ’62, who served as chairman of Tocsin during the 1961-62 school year. Gitlin, who was Goldmark’s successor for the next year, attributed the increased interest to the election of President John F. Kennedy ’40, who brought the nuclear arms race to the forefront of his presidential campaign.
In December, 40 members of Tocsin participated in a walk in which they passed around “a very sophisticated argument about the test ban,” Gitlin said. They asked Tocsin sympathizers to show their support openly by donning blue armbands.
“To our astonishment, 1,000 people wore those armbands,” he said.
But support for Tocsin was by no means universal. According to Glauber, who worked on the Manhattan Project while he was an undergraduate, it was not obvious at the time that all testing should be banned.
“There was a certain rationale for testing weapons,” he said.
The group faced opposition from many of the more conservative figures in the Harvard community.
“We were denounced publicly by a number of faculty members,” Gitlin said, “some of whom were people like Henry Kissinger who had contempt for us, as we did for him. We were controversial.”
EXERTING INFLUENCE?
But student involvement in protesting nuclear armaments eventually extended beyond the bounds of Harvard.
Along with several other disarmament groups throughout the country, Tocsin helped to plan and participated in a march at the nation’s capital from Feb. 16 to 17, 1962. Goldmark even spent an hour inside the White House talking with Kennedy’s top aides, according to a New York Times article from Feb. 17 of that year.
“Starting with the election of Kennedy in November, there could be a sense that since we were so nicely situated at Harvard we could have some sort of special reverberation in Washington,” said Gitlin, noting that the group was well-connected to the Kennedy administration.
“Our sense of our importance was no doubt inflated by this proximity to power,” he said.
In fall of 1963, the U.S. ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited all above ground testing.
“Did the [faculty] petition cause the signing? No. But I think that that petition and others at other places brought that forward,” Mendelsohn said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School graduate and national security expert Samantha Power urged the Law School class of 2010 to heed their moral compasses and remember that everyone is battling a “batcage” of insecurities—no matter how confident they appear.
Power, who graduated from the Law School in 1999, is the special assistant to the President and the senior director for multilateral affairs on the National Security Council, and the founder of Harvard Kennedy School Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
Power said that like many of the “overachievers” in the crowd, as a child she, too, was eager to make a name for herself. In fact, as a five-year-old, she took the liberty of scrawling “Samantha Power did this” in orange crayon atop her mother’s newly printed, 300-plus page doctoral dissertation, she recalled.
But Power reminded the graduating class to be sensitive to the hidden fears and insecurities harbored by all overachievers.
When Power first started at the Law School, fresh off the job as a war correspondent, she said she felt less prepared than her classmates, despite having survived a war zone in the former Yugoslavia.
“When you get into real world, it’s easy to believe you are the only one who doesn’t belong,” she said. “Remember, you see only their outsides—there could be a fleet of bats inside.”
She described the anxiety of approaching new tasks as a constant struggle, but one that can continually be mastered.
“Every one of you has a backstory, and probably a batcage,” she said. “Life is not about mastering uncertainty, it is about channeling it.”
Power urged the graduates-to-be to avoid “selling out,” or engaging in work that requires them to check their hearts at the door. She said consciences are never quiet for long, and that when one’s inner values start to “gnaw” and say “This is the only life you have!” it is time to “make yourselves vulnerable again” and change paths.
Power also urged students to engage fully in every task they approach, and to occassionally turn off the “modern muscle set” that allows for impressive feats of multitasking.
Law School Class Marshal Jessica E. Nachman said she was struck by how Power “spoke to us as peers.”
“What I took away is to never surrender our individuality and our skepticism and our power to achieve things that align with our passions,” Class Day Speaker Nilab N. Rahyar said.
Power concluded by reminding students that “these are the good old days,” emphasizing that the one thing about life we can control is how often we pause to appreciate it.
“Paths are not linear—there are a lot of jagged edges and detours along the way,” Power said after the speech. “You can’t script what you do with your law degree. You just have to listen to what your gut is telling you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1960, student housing—an essential component of the Harvard undergraduate experience—was on the verge of major transformation.
Administrators considered moving freshmen into the upperclass Houses, converting the iconic Yard dormitories into individual Houses, or constructing new housing options altogether. As students during the “Program for Harvard College”—a fundraising effort enacted by President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 in fall 1956 that raised $82.5 million for several campus initiatives in about three years—the Class of 1960 witnessed the establishment of Quincy House in 1959 and the construction of the Leverett Towers in 1960.
Lingering in the background of these developments were Harvard’s efforts to purchase the Bennett Street Yards, a prime stretch of riverfront property owned by the Massachusetts Transit Authority. The negotiations stretched from 1955 to 1966 and pitted the University against Cambridge City Council officials—particularly Alfred “Big Al” E. Velucci—who were opposed to the idea of a tax-exempt organization such as Harvard taking over an even larger share of lucrative Cambridge real estate.
But, according to alumni from the era, in an age when administration-enforced parietal hours restricted visits from Radcliffe girls and when jackets and ties were still required at every meal, students were not concerned about College housing policy.
TOP-DOWN CHANGE
The debate over whether to assign incoming freshmen into upperclass Houses took place almost entirely between administrators and faculty members.
Dean of Harvard College John U. Monro ’34 argued that relocating freshmen to the Houses would only make it easier for the class to get to know one another. In the spring of 1960, Monro told The Crimson that the main debate was over building new Houses or overfilling older ones, discounting other administrators’ claims that the new plan would profoundly affect the Harvard social community.
But some House Masters saw the proposed changes as having potentially profound effects.
John J. Conway, then the Master of Leverett House, opposed the plan to convert the Yard dormitories into three distinct Houses because, as he told The Crimson on April 22, 1960, the Yard, as the historic “core” of the campus, was “the best place for Freshmen to learn what the College is like.”
John H. Finley ’25 and John M. Bullitt ’43, the Masters of Eliot and Quincy Houses, respectively, echoed Conway’s concerns, citing logistical and cost issues. Only one House Master, Elliott Perkins ’23 of Lowell, voiced his support for Monro in The Crimson.
As for the student reaction to the plans—which, if enacted, would have significantly altered the course of the Harvard undergraduate experience—there seems to have been little other than the Freshman Council’s vote on May 11, 1960 to oppose the plan.
And given the Council’s chief complaint—that assigning freshmen to upperclass Houses would no longer allow “men to choose their own Houses and roommates in accordance with their individual preferences and interests”—the relatively limited student reaction appears to have focused on one specific consequence of the plan, rather than to the University’s failure to consult undergraduate opinion before instituting the change.
BOTTOM-UP INDIFFERANCE
According to Charles M. Strauss ’60, the very idea that the administration would—or should—bother to gauge student feedback before, say, altering the house system, was entirely foreign in 1960.
In fact, Strauss said, the idea that undergraduates themselves should be concerned with administrative affairs was equally foreign, even in cases where their experience was at stake.
“You’ve got to understand what Cambridge was like then. It was really decayed, basically like Pittsburgh,” he said, adding that Harvard Square was a haven in bleak, industrial Cambridge.
“We thought we had landed in paradise,” he said of arriving the Square . “There were four bookstores, five bookstores, nice haberdasheries, poets’ theatres, and plays and concerts galore. We were just not disposed to question the way things were.”
Strauss, who arrived at Harvard on scholarship in the fall of 1956 from his hometown in Providence, R.I., said that he was merely glad to have been admitted. But he attributes part of that disposition to the culture of the 1950s.
“You have no idea how different the ’50s were from the ’60s,” he said.
“And we’re all children of the ’60s now. The idea that undergraduates had any say in the way things turned out was unimaginable.”
Of the proposed changes to Harvard’s housing system—either the intended creation of three separate Yard houses, the planned purchase of the MTA yards, or the construction of the new facilities near the River—Strauss said that as far as he was concerned, “this was far above us.”
Charlton “Carl” S. Smith ’60 echoed that sentiment. He said that he first learned that the old MTA yards actually contained platforms and an abandoned subway terminal only after he had heard of the University’s plans to buy that land.
“We were content, you know? We’d been through the war, the economy had rebounded,” Smith said, adding that the only discussion he recalls among fellow undergraduates over the proposed housing changes had to do with the architecture of the new buildings. According to Smith, a former resident of Leverett House, the issue was that the new buildings like the Leverett Towers “were modern and square and very utilitarian and did not have the grace and charm the old buildings did.”
Ultimately, the University pursued neither its plan to divide incoming freshman among the Houses nor the construction of President Pusey’s “Tenth House” on the site of the Bennett Street yards, which it finally purchased in 1966 after more than a decade of negotiations with the city of Cambridge.
For many students at the time, however, the issue of housing changes left little impression 50 years later.
Unlike future students—who have gone so far as to storm University Hall in two later clashes over the administration’s policies—several other members of the class of 1960 all said that they were oblivious or indifferent to the University’s authority over the housing system, a significant feature of student life.
“We had troubles of our own,” Strauss said. “We had exams, majors, theses, and just the general day-to-day existence.”
Despite the central role House life may have played to the undergraduate experience, what the administration decided was “really none of our business,” he said.
In an age in which even the removal of hot breakfast has elicited a strong student response, the indifference both Strauss and Smith describe is emblematic of the silence that gave the Silent Generation its name.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only days after the first students staged a sit-in at Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., Harvard graduate student Michael L. Walzer was there to cover the events for Dissent magazine. And just days after that, Walzer was back in Cambridge, organizing students at Harvard and around the Boston area to stage similar protests.
By the end of the month, the informal gatherings materialized into the Lunch Counter Integration Committee at Harvard; across campuses, the movement came to be known as the Emergency Public Integration Committee. Both were led by Walzer and fellow graduate student Harvey Pressman, and their mission was to organize local picketing efforts.
While the actions of the Harvard picketers could not create the same impact as their Southern counterparts—members recalled the group as a small and mostly ignored presence on the Harvard campus—EPIC’s campaign paved the way for the growth of student activism throughout the decade.
“EMPHATIC DISINTEREST”
While the Greensboro students faced hostile customers and police during their protests at Woolworth’s lunch counters, Harvard EPIC members were met by “emphatic disinterest” from the patrons of the Brattle Square Woolworth’s and other Harvard students, according to Judith K. Eger ’62.
Although EPIC gained traction with small groups of students at schools including Harvard, MIT, and Brandeis and made ties with local branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Congress of Racial Equality, the “conformist ethic” of the 1950s had not yet given way to the decade of activism that followed, according to Franklin J. Bardacke ’63, who was involved in the protests as a freshman.
“Harvard students, other University students, were so uninterested in questions of justice in those days. The personal ambition was so all-absorbing,” Eger said. “Only after the ’60s people knew they were supposed to care.”
The College administration, when it chose to acknowledge the protests, was similarly resistant, according to Pressman.
“The administrators were almost totally 100 percent tight-asshole people in those days,” Pressman said.
Bardacke remembers being called in to meet with Dean of the Faculty McGeorge Bundy to discuss his involvement in the protests and warn him of the “Trotskyist” influence in EPIC.
“Bundy couldn’t scare me with ‘This is going to hurt your career, Frank,’” Bardacke said.
“THE SECOND SHOT”
While EPIC did not gain wide support on the Harvard campus, members were able to draw local attention to their cause.
“Companies such as Woolworth’s are very concerned about their reputation,” said Alan P. Gartner, who was a graduate student in 1960. “To have people, including Harvard students, calling attention to their bad behavior is significant.”
The group gained national attention as well with a full-page spread in Life Magazine. Alfred Eisenstaedt, the photographer who snapped the iconic picture of a couple kissing on V-J Day, held a photo shoot of four Harvard students—two white, two black—dressed in Minuteman costumes at the locations of the first battles of the Revolutionary War. Pressman called it “the second shot heard ’round the world.”
“We were constantly producing all these things that were trying to create the illusion that there was this groundswell of support,” Pressman said.
EPIC’s petition to end segregation at Woolworth’s lunch counters similarly caught the public eye, thanks to the signatures of Eleanor Roosevelt and Harvard faculty members such as Arthur M. Schlesinger and Oscar Handlin.
In fact, even a handful of administrators were sympathizers. Anthony “Tony” W. Robbins ’62, one of the models for the Life Magazine photoshoot, said he remembered meeting with Dean of the College John U. Monro ’34 about the legal implications of the pickets.
“After being read the riot act by the Dean, I asked in the most mild and friendly way what he would do,” Robbins said. “He said without missing a beat, ‘I’d go ahead and run the protest.’”
EPIC also provided “a kind of basic training” for those interested in social justice, according to Pressman. Many of the most active EPIC members were involved in later Civil Rights-era events—including the 1964 Freedom Summer—and other movements such as anti-Vietnam War protests. And the legacy of this early student movement, both at Harvard and around the country, provided a framework for the heyday of student engagement.
“This was part of the ice breaking,” Bardacke said. “The ice broke in South Carolina and the ice broke in Nashville. There were a few little cracks at Harvard, too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Business School’s class of 2010 celebrated their past two years as MBA students and their future prospects at a Class Day ceremony with friends, faculty, and family yesterday.
On the lawn in front of the Business School’s Baker Library, graduates listened to speeches by John W. Coleman, a member of the Class of 2010 who is graduating with a joint degree from the Kennedy School and Business School, and Ronald Cohen, a 1969 graduate of the Business School and one of the world’s leading private equity investors.
Throughout the ceremony, speakers alluded to the recent financial crisis and its impact on the business world, encouraging the class of 2010 to think outside the box in their careers.
“As we cross the stage tomorrow and step out into the world beyond this school, what if it’s more important than ever to recapture that child-like sense of imagination?” Coleman said. “What if, in a world so vastly transformed by crisis that it barely resembles the one we left in 2008, what matters most is not Excel proficiency or accounting acumen, but a passion and capacity for creativity?”
Cohen, considered one of the founding fathers of Europe’s venture capital industry, stressed the importance of social enterprise and entrepreneurship—both of which have seen an increased emphasis at the Business School in the recent past.
The afternoon was also marked by light-hearted reflection on the class’s two-year experience at the Business School.
“Something I’ve learned while here at HBS is that business schools students like to celebrate,” said Jamie D. J. Chang, a member of the Class Day Committee, which organized the ceremony.
“We’ve celebrated the 100 year anniversary of HBS, Iceland’s bankruptcy, Octoberfest in the beer houses of Munich, and more recently Queen’s Day in Amsterdam—name a national holiday and we’ve celebrated it,” Chang said. “Therefore we found it only fitting to have this Class Day to celebrate and showcase the great HBS class of 2010.”
Chang presented awards to his class’s five favorite faculty members, who were selected by a class vote. He praised Business School professors for their ability to interact with both opinionated and apathetic students in the classroom.
“Teaching is a difficult for a number of a reasons,” Chang said before he presented the faculty awards. “First of all, you have to teach HBS students, all of whom have strong opinions who are never wrong—never.”
“You have to respectfully ignore the classroom statues of liberty—you know who you are—and draw out comments from those who are always asleep or hungover or both,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
I suppose it’s a bit boring, when looking back over my time at Harvard, to write about academics. I imagine that others will write about an extra-curricular activity, a summer abroad, a night spent talking with a classmate about politics, or poverty, Lady Gaga, even.
But I can’t quite forget, as my parents sometimes remind me, that academics are a pretty important part of going to college. That when you crunch the numbers, we pay something like $300 for every hour of lecture. That we go to school to learn things from people who are smarter than we are, and those people are often professors. So I’d like to tell you about what I learned in class, and what I learned in my concentration, specifically.
Sophomore year, I declared a concentration in history and literature. I began to pick classes. I chose classes about war in America. Perhaps I can explain why.
I moved to New York on Sept. 1, 2001. I had lived abroad before—well, for most of my life: New York, London, Pittsburgh, Montreal, and back again to New York. I had always considered myself American. At least, I thought I was American, even though I bore unmistakable signs of an expatriate. I didn’t know any of the state capitals. Sometimes, when I wasn’t careful, I called my mother "mum."
A week into school, in the ninth grade homeroom, my chorus teacher said, "A plane has hit one of the Twin Towers." She cried. My classmates and I stood there, tried to understand. I walked home after school, right down Madison Avenue. There were no cars in the street—no taxis, even. The sky was blue and brilliant, but thick with smoke. There was dust, too, on sidewalks, and sheets of paper in gutters.
At the State of the Union address, in the chamber of the House of Representatives, President George W. Bush said, "We are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom." He declared a war on terror.
I forget, sometimes, that America is at war.
America was born in war, or through it, and I think it is continually defined by war: from a colony to a united states, from a house divided to a union, from a country to a world power. I choose to study the history and literature of war because I know we can find, there, some fundamental aspects of our nation’s character. War, I believe, is an act of self-definition. It reveals not only what a country is, but also what it hopes to be. I learned this in class—in "The American Revolution," "The American Civil War," "Art and Thought of the Cold War," and "War and Ideas in America."
After 9/11, my father quit his job at an airplane company in Montreal, and my mother started a job at an off-Broadway theater in New York—a few blocks north of Ground Zero. The first play she produced there, "The Guys" by Anne Nelson, was about a journalist who helped a fire captain write eulogies for men lost in the North and South Towers.
I saw the play too many times. These are the lines I remember: "This is my city, too," the journalist says. "I can’t just watch it on TV. I want to do something. But this is all I know how to do. Words. I can’t think of anything else." The fire captain says, "That’s okay. They’re your tools."
If, for a country, war is an act of self-definition, writing during a war, or about war (or really, any writing) is an act of self-confirmation. Words help to explain the traumatic reality of war, to make sense of it, and then to live in it and to live in its wake—whether it be John Singleton Copley’s letters from Europe to his half-brother Henry Pelham back in America or Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead. As I read these things, I learned something about reading the literature of war (or really, any reading): It is an act of self-validation. I didn’t live through the American Revolution or World War II. But I have seen things I did not want to see, and I have been confused, and afraid, too.
So here is the most important thing I’ve learned in class. More important than close reading or parsing the arguments of secondary sources—though those things have let me realize, and say, this:
In history and literature, I learned to ask when and how a text was written, but also why it lasted. I learned that a text could create and then support a community of writers and readers. I learned that sometimes, a book could be an answer to a private and unsaid prayer. That a book can say, "You are not alone."
Emily C. Graff ’10, a former Crimson magazine senior editor, is a history and literature concentrator in Currier House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the late 1950s, George C. Izenour, a pioneer of theater technology, was invited to a conference in New York City to consult on the construction of the New York Metropolitan Opera House. Izenour told his audience of top theater specialists about his ideas for a black box theater, specialized rigging systems, moving seat wagons, and electronic lighting boards.
“Everyone pooh-poohed him and told him he was crazy,” said Donald R. Soule, the original technical director at the Loeb Drama Center and assistant to Izenour. “The only person he seemed to impress was Harvard English professor Robert Chapman. Chapman called him up the next day and I answered the phone.”
Shortly thereafter, Izenour and Robert H. Chapman, who would become the first director of the Loeb, met in a small New Haven coffee shop where, on the back of a napkin, Izenour drew up the plans for what would become the Loeb.
While the theater scene on campus was thriving even before the completion of the Loeb in 1960, the state-of-the-art facility opened up new opportunities and eventually the chance for students to work alongside a professional theater company.
‘EVERYTHING ON OUR OWN’
Before the Loeb was constructed, student productions were a highly self-sufficient affair.
“We were extremely independent,” said Joel F. Henning ’61, former president of the Harvard Dramatic Club. “Was that was fun? Yes, absolutely. We got to do everything on our own, but the Loeb Drama Center changed all of that.”
Students involved in productions rented costumes, sets, and lighting equipment without help from the College. But this hands-on learning experience also led to some headaches.
“I forgot that Memorial Drive had huge oak trees hanging over it,” Henning said. “We were trucking a set to Agassiz and one of the oaks knocked it right off the truck into the middle of Memorial Drive.”
With the Loeb’s on-site scene shop and new rigging technology, students would no longer have to rely on rentals. However, access to such expensive and advanced equipment came with a price—a new non-student chain of command.
“We wanted to do some summer productions so we had to go be interviewed by President Pusey,” Charles W. Hayford ’63 said. “We didn’t really have control over the building.”
“Now, this is an institution. I couldn’t just say, ‘Hey let’s just do XYZ play,’” Henning said. “You had to go to Chapman, apply, and present all your ideas.”
Despite increased University control over the building and the introduction of professionals to run the space, alumni insisted that for the most part the Loeb was a positive addition to the dramatic arts on campus.
“It was a little more structured and a little bit more institutionalized. There were other [non-student] minds, but very creative minds, which were coming up with proposals,” Henning said. “But was it agony? Was it a hopeless bureaucracy? Certainly not.”
LEARNING THE ROPES
Alumni and former Loeb staff said the facility provided students with opportunities to learn from its cutting-edge facilities—and later from more experienced thespians.
In the fall of 1960, the first production, Shakespeare’s “Troilus and Cressida,” premiered on the Loeb Mainstage and presented students with an enormous learning opportunity.
“We were befuddled as we came nearer and nearer to the opening. The set just wasn’t looking right,” Henning said. The new space exposed students to dilemmas they had never seen in the dining halls and other spaces they had previously used. “We realized that the auditorium was steeply raked and the set didn’t extend far enough. We spent the next 24 hours painting the entire floor.”
But students weren’t the only ones excited about the Loeb’s dramatic possibilities.
In 1980, the American Repertory Theatre, a professional theater company founded by Robert S. Brustein, who also established the Yale Repertory Theatre, began using the Loeb for productions. Today the company is primarily housed in the Loeb, and most of the offices in the building are occupied not by students, but by the A.R.T.
Some alumni said they were shocked by this change, which raised doubts as to the purpose of the facility.
“At the time of its opening, if any of the Harvard leadership had in the backs of their minds–or the fronts of their minds–of bringing in a professional company, they kept it to themselves,” Henning said.
But with time, members of the HDC—now the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club—came to see the advantages of sharing space with the A.R.T.
“Initially, the students were reticent to have them and it was understandable; after all, it was their home and their baby. To have a strange group, especially coming from Yale, it was hard for them to get used to,” said Soule, the first technical director of the Loeb.  “But in time they realized the benefits of having this professional company.”
Soule said that even with the thriving theater community on campus, students could not realistically keep the building functioning 24/7.
“It’s the kind of situation that benefits both parties,” said J. Michael Griggs, current Loeb technical director and HRDC advisor. “For the professionals it’s a way to get space and have someone soak up the cost, and the students get the benefit of having professionals to learn from.”
Overall, those involved in the Loeb over the past 50 years agreed that the facility has primarily expanded the scope of student theater at Harvard.
“There was hardly a moment when there weren’t students working there,” Soule said. “There was an incredible amount of enthusiasm that appears to be going even to this day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in her living room, which overlooks the very buildings in which she took her finals at Radcliffe College, playwright Rosanna Y. Alfaro ’60 described a successful career that she had never envisioned during her time as a student.
“No. No, I wasn’t involved in theater at Harvard at all,” Alfaro said. “I was far too shy. I stayed clear of that scene.” Such a statement might seem odd coming from an accomplished playwright—she is author of 40 plays and numerous short stories—but her admitted avoidance of the dramatic arts while at Harvard did little to hinder Alfaro’s current profession.
But her peers said that the “shyness” belied Alfaro’s observant nature.
“She was a lot like she is now except maybe a little bit quieter,” said Carol L. Boulukos (née Snyder) ’60, Alfaro’s classmate who also currently lives in Cambridge. “She can seem shy but she’s not really at all, just quiet, always sizing things up.”
Alfaro, who is Japanese-American, said she could only remember there being three other Asians in her class when she arrived at Harvard in 1956. But it was gender, rather than race, that seemed to distinguish her on campus, Alfaro said. In her time as a Radcliffe College student Alfaro said she recalled that there were professors who would rather cancel class than speak freely on certain subjects—such as the novel “Finnegan’s Wake”—in front of women.
Despite some discouraging cancelled lectures, Alfaro, an English concentrator, began to develop her voice as a writer in her creative writing classes, which she said were her favorite. “They were small next to the large English lecture courses,” Alfaro said. “You suddenly felt like a real person.”
Then, in her senior year, The Harvard Advocate published two of Alfaro’s short stories, which she said pushed her to continue writing.
The women’s movement had only just begun to take form, and while most of her fellow classmates went straight from the dorms of Radcliffe to the role of housewife, Alfaro opted to further her education. Alfaro continued her studies at Berkeley, then began teaching English at Boston State College.
In the 1970s, Alfaro decided to dedicate her time to raising her two children. It wasn’t until Alfaro and her husband moved to Canada that her writing really began to take off; while living there, she published 21 short stories.
“It was much easier to get published there,” Alfaro said. “Here in America there is a writer everywhere you turn.”
Soon after, Alfaro began working on a novel about the Japanese internment camps—or at least attempting to. “In reality, it was really just plain awful but I realized it fit perfectly into three acts, so I thought maybe I should try turning it into a play. After that I never looked back,” she said.
However, Alfaro’s first play was not particularly well received. “It went across the country trailing bad reviews” Alfaro said, but she cited this as a powerful learning experience.  “It was just like a high school textbook—too much information, too expository—but I’ve weaned myself from that sort of thing.”
Alfaro said she thrived on the feedback and flexibility playwriting offered over her previous short stories. Since then, Alfaro has written 30 short plays and 10 longer plays.
“Plays are very different from writing short stories. You begin by yourself but then the actors comes in, and the director,” Alfaro said. “There is something very exciting about your characters turning into flesh and blood. You are amazed when the actor has heard the same voice in your head that you had while writing it.”
David Gidron, who began directing many of Alfaro’s plays 15 years ago, said it was her honesty and variety that drew him to her work.
“She is a terrific and fearless playwright with an individual and astute voice,” Gidron said. “She has a versatility, and there is always something very truthful about it. The characters can be very surprising, but they are truthful and you recognize them.”
Alfaro also wrote and co-produced a short documentary titled “Japanese American Women: A Sense of Place.” The film focuses on Alfaro and 12 other Japanese-American women as they struggle to find a place in a society dominated by stereotypes. Alfaro said she felt race-based hostility while at Berkeley, and that this experience influenced her  focus on  Japanese-American issues. Although much of Alfaro’s work focuses on Japanese-American identity, she has also dealt with subjects ranging dramatically from Greek mythology to biographical pieces based on figures such as Martha Mitchell and Pablo Picasso.
“They’re real and full of her humor and unique commentary,” Boulukos said of Alfaro’s plays. “They are always enjoyable.”
Currently, having just turned 71, Alfaro continues to write every day and is in the midst of her latest play about an Asian-American professor at Harvard on the cusp of old age. “When you write, everything in your life falls through the filter of the play. Sometimes it’s hard [to] extricate yourself,” Alfaro said.
Her latest play, which symbolically brings Alfaro back full circle to her days at Radcliffe, is a testament to that.

John H. Harbison '60 would not necessarily consider composing pure fun. Even after five symphonies, four operas, and multiple concertos, there is still something about the uncertainty of a piece in progress that would be, according to him, “wrong to describe as enjoyable.”
For Harbison, who can list a Pulitzer Prize and a MacArthur Foundation “Genius” Award among his accomplishments, settling on a career was never that difficult. He started improvising on the piano at the young age of 4 or 5; at 16 he won the prestigious BMI Student Composer Award. Now, at the age of 71, he is considered one of the most prominent musical figures of his time.
“I wasn’t too focused anywhere else... Actually I never thought I had the ability for anything else,” said Harbison, whose dilemma lay more in figuring out what genre of music he would pursue.
After considering concentrating in English, Harbison said he realized that he was just using literature to inform his compositions. He soon made music the focus of his undergraduate career by becoming a music concentrator and joining multiple ensembles outside of class. His love for a wide range of music—he was a member of the Harvard Glee Club and the Bach Society Orchestra, as well as chamber and jazz groups—would turn into a career notable for its versatility. Not only have his compositions spanned genres, but he has also taken up conducting and teaching.
Abbott “Tom” Gleason ’60, Harbison’s college roommate of three years, put on live jazz performances with Gleason on WHRB. According to Gleason, Harbison was not one to advertise his musical talent.
“Let me say, I did not realize the depth and extraordinary quality of his talent,” Gleason said. “He seemed like a nice high school guy interested in music.”
The two met while playing on the freshman soccer team in September of 1956. They both played defense, although Harbison mostly sat on the bench. “It took time to understand his genius. It was through the course of freshman year and beyond that I realized that,” Gleason said.
Harbison used his undergraduate years as practical training for his professional career. D. Stevens Garlick ’60, another one of his roommates, remembers that Harbison had an intuition for harmony as a young music concentrator and started composing immediately. There were about three or four big pieces each year, mostly for friends and acquaintances to perform.
“Initially the best way forward seemed to write music for people who I knew would play it multiple times,” Harbison said.
Harbison would go on to compose pieces for the Metropolitan Opera and serve as resident composer for the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Los Angeles Philarmonic. He would even be commissioned by the Vatican to write the choral piece “Abraham” and perform it for Pope John Paul II.
“Everybody knew that John was going to be something. We felt that we were rooming with a genius,” Gleason said. “People would look around and say, ‘This is Harvard. Who are the stars? Who are the people we want to know?’ And he was the number one guy in our class.”
Harbison credits his success to his ability to bring something new to each project he undertakes.
“I have been trying to not repeat myself. I get asked for pieces because people recognize that I won’t give something that I have already,” Harbison said.
He is currently a professor of music at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a position that has brought him back to the days of conducting a student ensemble. But Harbison continues to compose—at the moment he is focused on a piece for the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra based on the works of short story writer Alice Munro. As part of his research, Harbison says he has read most of her fiction.
“I could still work, and I still hope that I haven’t gotten even close to the best that I can do,” he said.  “I still have chances to write pieces. I’m not going to have to retire until nobody asks for them. I’m inspired by composers who have gone on for a long time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a bittersweet reminder of their impending departures from their Houses, soon-to-be graduates convened with their House Masters and families in the House dining Halls for one final hurrah before today’s Commencement ceremony.
The dinner events—which also invited alumni and House staff—concluded a week of Commencement celebrations that included meetings with alumni and luncheons hosted by the Houses.
“It’s a sad time, but I am excited about a new beginning,” Kathleen E. Golden ’10 said at the Adams House dinner. “I met a lot of my best friends in my House. The House Masters treat you like family and try to make it a fun experience for everyone.”
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said he reciprocated a feeling of deep connection with the students.
“We share their lives and hopes,” Palfrey said. “We love them and wish them well.”
Students said that the Palfreys are widely loved among Adams House by residents, citing, for example, the Palfrey’s institution of “drag night”—an annual ritual during which the housemasters perform skits alongside cross-dressed students.
Outgoing Quincy residents also fondly recalled their own Masters’ quirks: House Master Deborah J. Gehrke has become known for her ping pong playing—an activity that Marcelo Cerullo ’10 called “competitive but cute.”
Cerullo said that the penultimate House gathering made him nostalgic “for times that have not passed yet.” Graduating seniors receive their diplomas today in ceremonies held at the Houses.
This year’s House Master’s receptions are particularly full of nostalgia for House administrators who will be leaving their posts at the end of the academic year—including the Masters of Eliot, Mather, and Cabot Houses.
“We have had a very good time,” said Leigh G. Haffrey ’73, who has served as Mather House Master for 18 years. “We know that we are going to run into Matherites, and so I think that the community for me is going to be the same.”
Graduating seniors said that living in the Houses has prepared them to enter the next stage of their lives. For Cerullo, the Quincy House community has given him “a certain sense of confidence,” he said.
At several House receptions, former and soon-to-be-former students expressed a sense of unity, and alumni at the gatherings said that they shared the same emotional connection to their Houses as do current students.
“The experience of living in cooperation with other people and the staff made it special,” recalled Bonita Allen ’75, a Lowell alumna.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


At a dinner party last month, a biomedical engineer asked me a rude question. He was not trying to be rude. He was drunk. Informed that I am an English professor, he responded, "Why?" He explained that his mission in life is to save lives. Mine is to say clever things about dead writers. Prodded by his wife’s grimace, he backtracked a bit and reassured me that Shakespeare is "obviously important." Praising Shakespeare is how the world apologizes for its lack of interest in literature. Those of us who have devoted our lives to literature are dogged by this perpetual questioning of the worth of our work.
We live in an Information Age. New technologies and insurgent media have democratized the dissemination of knowledge. Children type their names before they write them. We devour a daily buffet of words. The average American reads and writes more today than at any time in our history—even if it’s TMZ we read and emoticon-peppered e-mails we write. We are all authors now. Sarah Palin has just written a book. Texting while driving has become a national problem. Last week I passed a young couple holding hands. With their free hands, they were texting. Fifteen years ago, bored students stared out classroom windows at squirrels. The window has become a laptop, and the squirrel, Facebook. The problem today is not illiteracy. It is hyper-literacy. We have no time for literature.
Fiction sales have plummeted. Poetry has become a fetish. Parents are terrified their children will become playwrights; it means they will never move out. The exodus of undergraduates from the humanities to occupational majors—coupled with the devaluation of literature and art in our society—has driven certain humanist disciplines to the brink of extinction. From the early 1970s to the mid 1980s, the number of English majors in the United States dwindled from 64,000 to 34,000. Despite the fact that more students across the country are attending college than ever before, less than four percent of them in 2004 chose to major in English, a number that has declined each subsequent year. In this era of rapid thumb-typing, the act of reading literature feels metabolically unnatural. It forces our sprinting brains to slow to a crawl.
Over the last three decades, literary scholars have utterly failed literature. Our sales pitch has worn thin. To an increasing number of students, our claims that literature refines the mind, makes one a more interesting and intellectually supple person, sound pretentious, or worse, therapeutic. The Arnoldian notion that culture elevates us, makes us empathetic and sensitive, is just not true. Don’t believe me? You should hear English professors discuss each other’s work! Students want to be empowered by knowledge, not refined or made precious by it. The age of the snob has passed. There will always be a core constituency of sweet-tempered undergraduates who find literature intrinsically fascinating, just as there will always be devotees of Wagner, bonsai, and Lithuanian folk dances. We will dote on this shrinking brood, praise them for savoring Auden while their peers gorge on "Glee." But let’s not shake our fists at the thumb-typers. It would be a mistake to circle the nerd wagons.
In truth, literature is perfectly positioned for a comeback. In a society comprised of compulsive writers and readers, of empty-calorie text, the study of artful language—of words that truly matter—is more necessary now than ever. If you cannot dance atop the tsunami of signifiers heading your way, it will crush you. Learn to breathe language, or else choke on it. If you cannot control it, it will control you. Your words will die on your lips; your thoughts will turn to dust. Taming unruly syllables—bending signification to suit your needs, understanding that everything is language, matrices of metaphor, of which you are a product—is a prerequisite for survival and success in the 21st century. Which will it be: the red pill or the blue one? No biomedical engineer could manufacture these pills.
What is literature, in the end, but the art of rendering uncanny one’s own language, of not taking words for granted, of watching language undulate in slow motion through space? Nietzsche understood this. The quotidian life of any language ("What’s up?" "Nice weather!" "LOL") is naturally disenchanting. 99.99 percent of the words we speak show no trace of life. Clichés trickle from our zombie mouths. We speak a lot and say little. Literature re-enchants language; it fills its lungs with gasps. What are the pangs induced by good poetry but a visceral realization of having taken our friend language for granted, of having broken its heart? Literature teaches us to see the words we live with as though for the first time. Literature shakes us from our sleepwalker’s daze. It is like discovering that your roommate of many years is not only hot, but also has loved you this whole time. Study literature. Study it like your life depends upon it—because, in this wordy young century, it does.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elizabeth H. Dole is known today as a former Republican Senator for the state of North Carolina, former candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, and the wife of Presidential candidate Bob Dole. But fifty years ago, she was a graduate student at Harvard.
As a student at the Graduate School of Education in 1960 and a member of the Harvard Law School’s class of 1965, Dole said she found Cambridge to be full of exciting opportunities. “There were all sorts of new experiences for a Southern girl, like learning to ski and ice skate and attending lectures in the Harvard community,” she said.
Dole, who had been a political science major at Duke, said she thought it “would be a great decision” to attend the School of Education because it offered a one-year program that allowed her to blend teaching with her interest in government.
“Student teaching was one of the most interesting times of my years there. I was teaching U.S. history and I wanted to make the pages come alive for the students,” said Dole, citing an instance when she found a man who had participated in the Boston police strike to come speak to her class while she was teaching about the subject.
Although Dole, despite encouragement from her professors, ultimately decided not to become a teacher, she said her education degree has come in handy during her political career—especially as she developed her public speaking style.
“When I was president of the Red Cross, I enjoyed walking out from behind the podium to visit with people in the audience,” Dole said. “I have a conversational style that comes from the days as a student teacher, when you’re walking up and down the aisles.”
This style became particularly newsworthy when she employed it at the 1996 Republican National Convention in support of her husband’s presidential campaign. “I was going down 12-15 steps in heels and talking, which was challenging but was an effective way to get your point across to the audience,” she said.
This friendly nature was evident even during her time at Harvard, according to Michael S. Saper, a classmate who sat next to Dole in a public international law class at the Law School. “She was a very nice person who was bright and attractive,” he said. “As I look back at my classmates, she was one of my favorites.”
Many of her later colleagues also said that this likability extended into her career.
“There are long hours working in government but you always knew that she was working just as hard, or harder, than you were,” said Kerry Tymchuk, who served as Dole’s speechwriter for many years. “She wakes up every morning wanting to make a positive difference.”
Dole said that throughout her career she has always tried to serve the public. She cited her work at the Department of Transportation and the American Red Cross as her proudest achievements in the years since she left Harvard.
At the Department of Transportation, Dole said she dedicated much of her time to automobile safety by targeting laws to increase the use of safety belts and airbags.
“I felt the most important thing I could do was take on safety in a major way; it meant saving lives and preventing crippling injuries,” she said.
During her tenure at the American Red Cross, Dole led a complete overhaul of the way blood was organized and distributed. “The Red Cross provides half of America’s blood, and the World War II infrastructure was out of date,” she said.
The American Red Cross provided Dole with the opportunity to become the first female president since its founding by Clara Barton in 1881. Many of Dole’s closest colleagues said they believe that she has consistently been a strong woman in politics.
“In Washington, she was often the only woman in the room when decisions were being made. She felt pressure to do well, and be a pioneer for other women. It’s been a lifetime of firsts since leaving Harvard,” Tymchuk said.
Dole was also committed to giving other qualified women opportunities to move up in the ranks, particularly through her initiatives at the Department of Transportation. “There have been times when I’ve been through airports when a woman would run after me and say, ‘Ms. Dole I want to talk to you. I’m the manger of this airport and I’m here because of the women’s program at the Department of Transportation.’”
But Dole has made a difference in her daily life as well as in her political life, according to her assistant, Gia M. Colombraro. “I truly find all the time that I learn something from her every day,” she said. “She would have made a great teacher.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of Nov. 5, 1940, seven-year-old Michael S. Dukakis—future governor of Massachusetts and the Democratic party’s 1988 presidential nominee—set up a card table in the living room of his family’s Brookline home, where he turned on the radio and carefully tracked the results of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s victory over Wendell L. Willkie.
As the former president of his third-grade class at Brookline’s Edith C. Baker Elementary School, Dukakis—an Eagle Scout—said that he had always been interested in politics.
“Every Greek kid knows that democracy began in Athens,” he said.
But Dukakis also credits two prominent political figures from the 1950s as inspiration: the charismatic John F. Kennedy ’40, whom Dukakis saw speak at Harvard Law School, and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, whose actions “infuriated” him.
After graduating from Swarthmore in 1955, Dukakis served for two years in Korea.
When he returned to Boston in 1957, he said, he was ready to study law.

At the Law School, Dukakis’s classmates were struck by his sense of humor and his involvement with local politics.
Earl J. Silbert, a friend from the Law School, remembers playing tennis with Dukakis and meeting for lunch in Boston Common when they were both working for downtown law firms.
According to Silbert, in those years Dukakis was primarily interested in politics at the local and state level. In fact, Dukakis said, while he was a student at the Law School he commuted from Brookline, where he was heavily involved with urban renewal projects.
Law professor Philip B. Heymann, who also graduated from the Law School in 1960, recalls the remarkable speed with which Dukakis entered local politics after graduation.
“His manner was like it is now,” said Heymann. “He had a confidence and poise about him. It seemed extraordinary to [me as] a law student that someone would be in the legislature so soon.”
Dukakis was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1962 and became governor of the Commonwealth 13 years later.
DIRECTING THE COMMONWEALTH
As governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis is perhaps most fondly remembered for his improvements to Boston’s mass transit system.
He was also the principle architect of “the Big Dig,” which attempted to alleviate the traffic that cut through Boston.
In the words of A. Paul Cellucci, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, the Big Dig “beautified the city of Boston, eased traffic flow, and provided easy access to Logan airport for the people of Massachusetts.”
Not all, however, agreed with Dukakis’s fiscal policies.
According to Celucci, Dukakis raised the state income tax from 5 percent to 5.95 percent in a hike that he promised would only be temporary.
“It was clear that in late ’80s things were really getting out of control in terms of the fiscal management of state government,” Celucci said. “Spending was up; taxes were up. People wanted some fundamental changes in the fiscal management of state government.”
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
Dukakis said that he had never even considered running for president until he watched the events of the Iran Contra scandal unfold in November 1986.
“I couldn’t believe it,” he said. “The president and vice-president were lying to Congress, misleading the American people, and violating the law—it was appalling.”
And although Dukakis lost the election to George H.W. Bush by a large margin—he garnered 111 electoral votes to Bush’s 426—among the most memorable aspects of 1988 election was Dukakis’s reaction to the “Willie Horton” scandal.
The scandal refers to the 1986 weekend furlough release of Willie Horton, who was serving a life sentence for murder in a Massachusetts prison. Horton did not return to jail after his furlough and subsequently raped a woman twice, after assaulting her fiancé in April 1987.
According to Susan R. Estrich, Dukakis’s campaign manager in 1988, the Willie Horton scandal then became a “surrogate for the question of values” in the election, an instrument for determining whether one was “on the side of the criminal or the victim of the crime.”
Although Dukakis did not institute the Massachusetts furlough program during his tenure, he nevertheless defended it as a means of criminal rehabilitation.
The incident became an opportunity for the Bush campaign—which called him a “Massachusetts liberal” who was far too extreme for the White House—to attack Dukakis’s values.
FACING DEFEAT
Recalling the campaign, Dukakis said he regrets his failure to fight back.
“I don’t resent [Bush],” he said. “I’m angry at myself for not recognizing that when someone comes at you with an attack campaign, you’ve got to fight back. You’ve got to have a carefully thought-out strategy to deal with it, and we didn’t. I blame myself more than anyone else.”
Estrich, however, who has written about her own experience as a rape survivor, said she had known very well how powerful the Willie Horton issue would be.
“No one understood better the power of that incident than I did... It was an issue, and it was an issue we knew was coming.”
But Estrich, who is a 1977 graduate of the Law School, said that Dukakis “was not a great one for throwing the mud at the other guy. Even in the primaries he used to frustrate us because he didn’t want to go negative on the other side.”
For Estrich, it became clear that Dukakis had lost the election during the presidential debate moderated by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw. Shaw had opened the debate by asking Dukakis if he would favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer were his own wife raped and murdered, and Dukakis responded that he would not.
According to Estrich, she, Bill Clinton, and Dukakis had rehearsed his answer to what she called “the passion question,” but Dukakis had failed to recognize the question about his wife for what it was—a chance to salvage his image from the Bush campaign’s accusations.
Estrich was the first person to see Dukakis after the debate. She recalled that he came up to her and said, “I blew it. I’m sorry.”
“Some of the things [Dukakis is] most criticized for are sticking to his principles, like death penalty,” Heymann said in an interview. “He stuck to his principles and is a totally honorable guy.”
But, in Estrich’s view, an “honorable guy” is not necessarily a winning politician: Dukakis’s refusal to retaliate against the Bush campaign was not his most advantageous decision.
“The sad commentary is that it reflects very positively on his integrity and his dignity,” she said,“but it just wasn’t a winning strategy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard wrestling does not often garner as much attention as other sports on campus. But with an escape, a takedown, and a reverse, all of that changed this spring. Co-captain J.P. O’Connor claimed a national title for the Crimson at 157 lbs., making it clear that the small Harvard program belongs on the biggest stage.
“When Jesse [Jantzen ’04 won the national title], I remember him coming in and almost single-handedly raising the program to the next level. With J.P. it was exactly the same,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “He made it clear that you can come [to Harvard] and win.”
Indeed, O’Connor made a habit of winning during the 2009-10 season, going 35-0 as the top-ranked wrestler in his weight class. His final victory, a 6-4 win over Chase Pami of Cal Poly, was a stellar conclusion to a season that often lacked team highlights. Still, although the Crimson (2-14-1, 0-5 Ivy) struggled in the dual season, the entire squad eagerly contributed to the success of all three of its NCAA qualifiers—O’Connor, co-captain Louis Caputo (184), and freshman Steven Keith (125).
“It takes more than one person to win [a championship],” Weiss said. “Guys did great job of staying focused. The dual meet season wasn’t the best, but for J.P. to represent us on the center mat [at nationals] was great for the program.”
Caputo and Keith did not fare as well—falling short of the All-American honors that accompany a top-eight finish—but the number of representatives from such a small team showed just how far  Harvard has come.
“This year was a step in the right direction,” O’Connor said. “The sport is such a battle mentally...Everybody is talented and everybody at this level is physically gifted, but we did a better job of coaching on the mental game—going out there and pushing ourselves to be mentally tough.”
This toughness was crucial in a season once again marked by injuries. Although the Crimson opened the dual season with high hopes, when injuries felled senior Andrew Knapp, sophomore Walter Peppelman, and a number of talented freshmen, rookies were forced to step into starting roles immediately. The dual meet record reflected this inexperience, with Harvard falling to Princeton, Penn, Brown, Columbia, and Cornell by a combined score of 183-54 in a difficult Ivy slate. Still, O’Connor pointed out that getting back on the mat was the best way to change this result.
“A lot of guys can wrestle in the practice room...but it’s a different story when you step out on the mat and you’re one of the 10 guys,” the co-captain said. “[Competing] allows these guys to go out and gain that experience early on...With these freshman guys going in, you can only imagine what they’re going to do when they’re juniors and seniors and have 50 bouts under their belts.”
With Keith and former No. 1 junior Corey Jantzen (141) back to lead the way, along with a fully rehabilitated Peppelman, this experience may pay off sooner rather than later. Joined by six more talented recruits, the Crimson will look to rebound in 2011—as long as it can keep 10 grapplers healthy.
“It’s a numbers game,” Weiss said. “Our roster’s so small that when we get someone hurt, we can’t replace that. I think the guys we have on our team are quality people—we’re ranked No. 1 in the country in GPA—but it’s strictly a numbers game...Hopefully in the next couple of years we’re building that depth that we need.”
Certainly, if Harvard can stay on the mat it will have the coaching to become competitive. O’Connor will be joining Weiss on the staff as he trains for the 2012 Olympics, taking time to mentor other Crimson national-championship hopefuls.
“I’ll be doing my best to try to help achieve the goals we set as a team,” O’Connor said. “I’d love to see our team put together a season where we’re able to have our 10 starters step out on the mat together and really see what we can do. I really think we can compete with anybody in the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past week the story of Adam B. Wheeler has swept the nation. His unbelievable story of an alleged fabricated academic history has brought on parodies, increased scrutiny of the admissions process, and even comparisons to famous con artists like Frank William Abignale, Jr., famously portrayed in the film “Catch Me If You Can.” While the details surrounding Wheeler’s alleged lies and forgeries are of a sensational nature, academic dishonesty is unfortunately not a rare offense committed at Harvard. In a review of the Administrative Board of Harvard College, the College’s student disciplinary body, the Crimson found that almost a quarter of the students Harvard asks to withdraw each year are asked to do so because of academic dishonesty. Just two weeks ago as well, a faculty panel voted to dismiss a student that had obtained confidential information about his course instructor in order to change his grades through the University computer system. Wheeler may be rare, but his actions unfortunately are not.
Of all the things that could go wrong at a university, it may, at first, seem surprising that dishonesty is the most shattering. Next to racist comments, student violence, and faculty paychecks, Wheeler’s fraudulent background has gained more press than any recent Harvard story of late, and it illustrates that academia, more so than any other field, is built on trust. More importantly, from this trust comes our ability to forge and present our own identities.
Just getting into college provides the first example of this issue. Harvard, like other top-ranked schools, has an extremely competitive admissions process with very high standards. But rather than embellishing our grades or our activities in high school, we present our honest histories. We do this because we trust that others are doing the same, but more importantly, because we believe our actual selves are worth accepting. Honesty on our applications is the first indicator that honesty helps us preserve our identities.
For a student, the admissions process is not the only event in which honesty is critical but rather a sign of things to come. Academic life at Harvard is centered on honesty. We often take for granted that what our professors teach us is true, but our faith in their integrity allows us to approach classes with an open mind to new ideas and different perspectives and to incorporate these lessons into our knowledge of the world. This may seem entirely obvious, but it is this simple notion that makes Wheeler’s case so jarring; we assume at Harvard that we are all being honest. When working together we naturally believe that our classmates are truthful when they explain an answer to a problem or draw a comparison to something from the syllabus. Of course, honesty is important in almost every field, but it is a particularly salient issue in academia because uncovering falsehoods is so difficult.
Whereas in the real world, there are frequently tangible products that can verify someone’s work—like the detail of a painting or the utility of a computer program, in college, our work is often entirely in our thoughts and ideas. Because these things are so much easier to plagiarize, or make up entirely, honesty takes on a heightened importance. With no ability to verify the experiences our classmates say they have, faith in their honesty is the only background check we can make. For the most part, this works; reported grade point averages are accurate, and résumés are valid. Our faith in this system of faith is challenged when individuals exploit others’ trust through misrepresentation. Although Wheeler has allegedly demonstrated that it is possible to fabricate almost an entire person’s background, what becomes even clearer now is that small changes to one’s personal or professional history will most likely never be spotted. It is unreasonable for every employer to fact-check every aspect of every résumé, and even with the accelerating size of the Internet, it probably never will be. This does not mean, however, that Wheeler’s alleged outing will cause fraud and forgery to increase. On the contrary, his story points to reasons why it will not.
With the allegedly fraudulent résumé created by Wheeler and the paper trail he left at Harvard and Bowdoin Colleges circulating widely now, we know a great deal about who Wheeler is not but know little about who he is. Acts of dishonesty in academia, and elsewhere, may bring people like this some measure of success, but it also deprives them of an actual self. In the week before my freshman year at Harvard I participated in an orientation week hiking trip in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and Adam Wheeler was a member of that trip. When the news of his story starting spreading rapidly, I looked back at the pictures of Adam and me in the woods and tried to call up any memory I had of him. With the veracity of his history under fire, it’s now hard for me to tell which conversations I had with Wheeler were real, and which were false. I spent a sizeable amount of time with this man, and yet I cannot say who he is. Honesty allows us to present our actual selves to the world, and without it we cease to have an actual identity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty years after graduating from Harvard Law School, “Nino” has reached the top of his profession. He has been a Faculty member at the University of Chicago, Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel, and has served on America’s highest court since 1986, where he has positioned himself as the intellectual leader of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court.
Friends say that the hardworking student 50 years ago possessed many of the traits that have defined Associate Justice Antonin G. Scalia’s time on the bench—his relentless work ethic, quick wit, and intellectual weight.
In Law School, friends say, Scalia was fiercely dedicated to his studies.
“For a time in our first year at law school, I lunched daily with Nino and another fellow, but I soon stopped. They would spend lunch going over the notes from their morning classes,” said Richard M. Coleman, who was Scalia’s classmate and friend during college at Georgetown University and law school at Harvard. “I said ‘this is more zealous than I want get.’”
For his part, Scalia admits to spending much of his time at the Law School studying.
“I do not look back at my years at Harvard Law School with great warmth,” he said. “I look back at them with great appreciation. I worked like hell. I didn’t spend a whole lot of time enjoying myself.”
Despite becoming consumed with his academic work and eventually the Harvard Law Review, where he served as an editor, Scalia found time to meet a Radcliffe undergraduate, Maureen T. McCarthy ’60, whom he married.
Scalia, who graduated magna cum laude from the Law School, was not a humorless bookworm, friends say; in fact, many point to his wit as one of his defining characteristics.
“He was jovial, gregarious, good company, liked company, a good talker, could be quite funny in conversation,” Harvard Law School Professor Frank I. Michelman, who graduated from the Law School with Scalia, wrote in an e-mail.
The Justice’s humorous bent has also influenced his work on the Court.
He is known for writing sometimes caustic dissenting opinions, according Harvard Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon, who teaches constitutional law.
Harvard Law School Professor John F. Manning ’82—who clerked for Scalia in 1988 and then argued cases in front of him as assistant to the solicitor general—said the Justice’s intellectual vitality was visible in oral argument as well.
“He’d come up with some pithy example that would capture the essence of a position. When it supported you, you were very happy and when it didn’t you were very unhappy.”
Besides delivering what are sometimes debilitating counter-arguments, Scalia also brings some levity to the bench.
A 2005 Boston University study determined that, of the Justices on the bench at the time, Scalia induced the most laughs during oral argument.
“Life in the law doesn’t have to be dull,” Scalia said. “I hope I haven’t lost a sense of humor as I’ve gotten older.”
His classmates say they did not predict their sometimes jocular peer would one day be a Supreme Court Justice.
“He was obviously smart and quick and seemed to relish conversation about the coursework and sundry issues that it raised,” Michelman wrote.
“I don’t recall envisioning any of my classmates a Supreme Court justice; it just was not the sort of thought that would have entered my mind at the time.”
Since President Ronald Reagan appointed Scalia to the bench, he has often been called the intellectual leader of the conservative wing of the court, according to Fallon.
“He is an absolutely brilliant writer. Perhaps the best stylist ever to serve on the Supreme Court,” Fallon said.
While Fallon is quick to praise the craftsmanship of Scalia’s prose, like many Faculty members at the nation’s law schools, Fallon disagrees with Scalia’s judicial philosophy.
Scalia is an originalist who believes in interpreting the Constitution in a manner that adheres to the Founders’ original intentions. Scalia said his alma mater is not uniquely responsible for teaching young lawyers to embrace shifting interpretations of the Constitution, a position which he opposes.
“You can’t just blame it on Harvard. It’s the overwhelming philosophy in law schools and on the bench,” he said.
He said he believes that mentality has even made its way into public discourse.
“The people believe the Constitution means whatever they care passionately about,” Scalia said.
He was also displeased with changes in the judicial nomination process, where, Scalia said, some politicians approve nominees based on how they are expected to vote in politically charged cases.
Despite knowing he was conservative, the Senate approved his appointment in 1986 with 98 votes, Scalia said. Now, he said, he does not know if he could get 60—the number of votes necessary to overcome a filibuster.
“The process has gotten much more adversarial,” he said.
The Senate is currently considering the Supreme Court nomination of Solicitor General and former Dean of Harvard Law School Elena Kagan, with whom Scalia has also crossed paths at Law School events. In an interview with The Crimson on May 18, Scalia’s comments about Kagan were brief, but positive.
“I consider Elena Kagan a friend,” he said. “I’m sure that I would get along very well with her were she to be on the court. Beyond that it is none of my business.”

For wisdom, wine, and the Harvard women’s volleyball team, things only get better with age.
In their fourth and final year as Crimson athletes, the team’s four seniors led Harvard (12-13, 8-6 Ivy) to its best season since 2004.
“Over time, we had more depth and chemistry,” Crimson coach Jen Weiss said. “Our overall athletic play has gotten better for the past three or four years.”
After going 4-7 in nonconference play, the Crimson commenced its Ivy League season with back-to-back losses to Dartmouth. After beating Cornell and Columbia to even its Ivy League record at 2-2, the team defeated Princeton at home in a tight five-set match, one of the highlights of the season. It was Harvard’s first win over the Tigers since 2002.
The Crimson went 5-4 in its remaining matches, completing season sweeps of Brown, the Lions, and the Big Red. With its 3-0 blanking of Cornell at home on Halloween, Harvard marked its first season sweep of the Big Red—a team it hadn’t beaten in conference play since 2004—in seven years.
The Crimson finished the season 8-6 in the Ivy League, securing Harvard fourth place in the conference.
The Crimson’s best performance came in the season’s last weekend, when Harvard traveled to Philadelphia, Penn. to take on the undefeated University of Pennsylvania team. Down 2-1, the Crimson, led by freshman Taylor Docter, rallied to take the 3-2 win. With the victory, Harvard broke another drought against a conference rival, as it was the squad’s first win over the Quakers since 2004.
“They were undefeated and we beat them on their home turf,” co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn said. “It was really nice to win that game.”
Aside from Horn, seniors Lily Durwood, Katherine Kocurek, and Alissa Flesher all made an impact.
“They were a solid foundation and really fed off of each other,” Weiss said. “Volleyball is a game of momentum, and they would play off of each other’s strengths.”
Kocurek set a team record with 1,416 career digs, while Durwood notched 3,410 total assists, good for third in the Harvard record books.
Aside from its talent, the senior class was remarkable for its closeness and leadership.
“We love each other to no end,” Horn said. “We had a really strong class from the beginning. A lot of us have played since freshman year.”
The team also received notable contributions from underclassman talent, in particular from three sophomores, each of whom received Ivy League honors. Sophomores Anne Carroll Ingersoll and Christine Wu each were named second-team All-Ivy, and classmate Sandra Lynne Fryhofer received honorable mention.
Ingersoll led the Ivy League with 1.14 blocks per set and averaged 2.81 kills per set—second-best on the team. Wu averaged 5.11 digs per set, good for third in the league, and led the team with 28 aces. Ingersoll will join current co-captain Miyoko Pettit as a leader of the 2010 squad.
“It will be even better for next year’s team,” Horn said. “We still have a lot of our main players, we have some great recruits coming in, and the bulk of the team is still going to be together.”
Weiss and her players hope to build on this season’s improvement and reinstate Harvard as a contender for the Ivy League championship.
“We’re definitely going to miss our seniors, for their experience and leadership,” Weiss said. “We’re going to have to work hard. Our freshman class will come in and make an impact.”

There were times this past season when the injury-riddled Harvard men’s volleyball team was worried it would not have enough healthy players to field a six-person lineup.
“With so few guys, I’ve never seen so many injuries,” said co-captain Gil Weintraub, who himself suffered everything from a pulled groin to multiple eye infections.
The injury bug first bit the Crimson in the fall when junior Shaun Mansour went down with a torn ACL. Things kept getting worse from there as senior Soren Rosier twice dislocated his shoulder, Weintraub hurt his hamstring, and sophomore Dan Schreff suffered a concussion.
But on top of finding enough healthy players to fill out lineup card, Harvard (5-16, 3-5 EIVA Hay) also had to find a way to win, something the team struggled to do in the early going. The Crimson went nine games and 39 days into the 2010 campaign before the team eventually came away with its first victory.
“We faced an extraordinary amount of adversity during the season,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We had injury after injury from day one. It just made it really hard for us to play with any consistency. At times we were able to overcome it, and at times we weren’t.”
But the Crimson managed to pull itself together just when it mattered most—the start of conference play.
After beginning the season 0-9, Harvard went on a roll, winning five of its next eight matches to put itself in contention not only for a place in the EIVA playoffs, but also for the top spot in the division standings.
“Anytime [you lose that many games], any team is at risk of crumbling and not making it through that,” Baise said. “This team was incredible in that way. They came to practice every single day. They wanted to do nothing more than try to get a little better. We knew at some point the victories would come.”
The victories started to come in game 10, when the Crimson swept conference opponent NJIT behind 20 kills from sophomore Matt Jones and 47 assists from Weintraub.
“We used the adversity to kind of fuel us,” co-captain Erik Kuld said. “You really start doubting yourself and doubting your team, but we were patient, and it felt great to get that monkey off our back.”
Following its first triumph, the wins kept on coming, as Harvard won its next two games against division opponents, sweeping Sacred Heart and defeating NYU, 3-1—putting the Crimson just one game back of first-place Rutgers-Newark.
The two teams met on Apr. 9, but once again, injuries hurt Harvard, as the team was without Weintraub, who missed the contest due to a groin injury.
The Crimson’s typically strong attack failed to put a dent in the big Rutgers-Newark defense, finishing with a 16-percent attack percentage and surrendering the contest, 3-0.
The team lost its momentum from there, as Harvard dropped its next three conference matchups, removing the Crimson from playoff contention.
“In the end, it didn’t end up going our way, but we made a good show of it,” Weintraub said.
Weintraub, along with Kuld, provided much of the skill on the court and motivation off of it that helped the team stay focused, even when things were looking bleak.
While Kuld led the team with 322 kills, Weintraub finished the season with 277 assists and 126 kills.
“It’s a very resilient bunch of guys,” Baise said. “[Weintraub and Kuld] weren’t going to let anyone quit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given the space in this section to say goodbye to my days at Harvard, The Crimson, and especially Crimson Sports, I would prefer to reflect on my hesitancy to say hello.
I understood what I was getting myself into by attending college in Boston during the pinnacle years of Boston sports. The Red Sox had broken the curse, the Celtics had rebuilt a championship-caliber team, and my roommate had an unabashed man-crush on Tom Brady.
Coming from Alabama, I felt there was no room for my post-90s Braves, my six-year Iron Bowl-drought Alabama Crimson Tide, my Jim Haslett-era Saints, or my total apathy towards the NBA.
And so, for much of my time here at Harvard, I’ve felt like a sports outcast.
But a magical thing began happening this year: my teams started to be good again. Sure, the Braves are still slogging it out with the Mets at the bottom of the NL East, but the Crimson Tide and the Saints proved they were the best of the best.
All of a sudden, I could wear my Mark Ingram #22 jersey with pride; people began to realize my “BAMA” shirt stood for Alabama, not Obama; and if I shouted “Who dat?” in the Kirkland House dining hall, I could feel confident that it would not go unanswered.
But more than a reinvigorated love for the teams I had abandoned to come north for school, I felt a reinvigorated sense of the diversity that Harvard brings together.
After four years at this place, we all become, more or less, “Harvard students.” It defines us for these four years: we are all taught to write the same (Expos), eat the same (HUDS), and sleep the same (twin-sized extra long).
For me, at least, it was so easy to forget the life I had before these four years. As they say, “These have been the best years of my life.” I have been exposed to so many ideas and opportunities, including traveling to China and Honduras. Harvard has allowed me to spread my wings further than I could have ever imagined.
But as I gave a knowing head nod to the kid in Winthrop with my same “BAMA” shirt, I realized my roots still hold firm in the red clay of Alabama.
I wish I had a more academic reason for arriving at this revelation than the resurgence of a few of my favorite sports teams. I also wish I could say this was an understanding that I had come to earlier than just this afternoon, while contemplating what to write for a parting shot. I guess, to quote that guy from the Counting Crows, “You don’t know what you’ve got ’til it’s gone.”
But that’s what makes Harvard so rich; that, although we are all encouraged to expand our minds and broaden our views, what makes us truly unique are our roots.
What each of us brings to Harvard is in many ways far more significant than what we take away. Let’s be honest, we’re far more engaged by a heated conversation with friends over lunch than we are in a Core section in the basement of CGIS.
So to future generations of Crimson sportswriters—of all Harvard students—let that be my advice to you. No matter what you may be leaving behind to come to Harvard, never let go of it. Because the greatest thing that I’ve learned here in my four years is that Harvard, while encouraging me to spread my wings, has also strengthened my roots.

Although every team hopes to improve upon its past performances and to move up in the rankings, it’s a difficult feat to accomplish. But the cross-country and track teams did just that, recording many strong individual and team results this season.
“In the past couple of years, there was a feeling that we were heading in the right direction, but this year we actually started moving that way,” said track and field co-captain Jack Brady. “We made up a lot of ground...and we are in the right place to really get after the top couple of teams in the league.”
The cross-country teams started out the season on the right foot, with both the men’s and women’s squads seeded in the top eight in the preseason regional rankings and the women’s team eventually climbing to third.
The men’s squad finished 13th at the IC4A meet and had three top-10 finishes during the season, placing sixth at the Heptagonal Championships and 10th at NCAA Regionals and the UAlbany Invitational. Junior Dan Chenoweth led the team by claiming the Ivy League individual crown, earning All-Ivy and all-region honors, and crossing the line with a 42nd-place finish at the NCAA Championships—his second consecutive top-45 finish at the event.
The women’s squad earned numerous top-12 finishes throughout the season, taking second at the Heptagonal Championships—the team’s best result in the meet since 1995. The squad also took the crown at the Iona Meet of Champions, finished fifth at NCAA Regionals, and earned a ninth-place finish at the ECAC Championships. There were strong individual performances  at the NCAA Championships as well, with junior Claire Richardson and sophomore Kailyn Kuzmuk placing 100th and 185th, respectively. Richardson and freshman Sammy Silva earned All-Ivy League honors, and Richardson, Kuzmuk, and Silva were awarded all-region accolades.
“The women’s team took a huge step, and we really came together,” Richardson said. “We really learned how to run as a team, and people were pretty inspired.”
The momentum of the program carried on into the winter indoor track season. Both the men’s and women’s teams captured titles at the Battle of Beantown, a meet against Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern held at Gordon Indoor Track this year.
Both teams followed this showing by placing fourth at the Indoor Heptagonal Championships, marking an improvement of four positions from the team’s eighth-place finishes when the current seniors were freshmen.
“Watching how far we’ve come as a team was obviously very special to me,” Brady said. “Seeing everyone reap the benefits of [their time and effort] has been extremely gratifying.”
The teams finished out the season with the men’s squad tying for 27th at the IC4A meet, and the women coming in 16th in the ECAC competition. The men’s distance medley relay team took the title in the meet and clocked in the second-fastest time in school history at 9:44.18, while the women’s distance medley relay team finished third and broke the school record at 11:34.03.
The outdoor spring track season featured several outstanding individual and team performances. At the Penn Relays, both the women’s distance medley relay team and the 4x800-meter relay team broke the school records for their separate events and won collegiate titles, posting times of 11:21.31 and 8:46.98, respectively. Richardson also toppled the school record for the 3K at the ECAC Championships, finishing second in 9:23.03.
The teams ended the season with a pair of seventh-place finishes at the Heptagonal Championships, and the men’s team tied for 51st at the IC4A meet, while the women came in 31st in the ECAC competition.
“I thought our team as a whole really came together and competed hard,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “I’m really proud of the effort that we had throughout the entire year.”
“Our sport is somewhat unique in that it is really six sports—six different teams—but at the same time, it is all one big family and continually competing,” he added. “There were a lot of incredible moments and highlights and things that we as a group feel really proud of...We want to continue to build on that but also continue to enjoy the pursuit of our goals and...[to compete] in the sport that we love.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tone was somber at the Undergraduate Council’s final meeting of the fall semester.
The Council was gathered to vote on a widely-debated and emotionally-charged issue—the censure of former Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 for her role in the turbulent aftermath of the UC’s November presidential election.
For the majority of the election season, the race pitting George J.J. Hayward ’11 and Felix M. Zhang ’11 against Johnny F. Bowman ’11 and Eric N. Hysen ’11 had stayed relatively friendly, a far cry from the acrimonious election the year before between Andrea R. Flores ’10 and Benjamin P. Schwartz ’10.
With the results tallied and certified by the UC Election Commission, Bowman and Hysen were deemed the new leaders of the UC.
But shortly before notifying the winning candidates, the EC abruptly announced that they had voted to de-certify the results and three EC members—including the chair—resigned in protest.
Amid the confusion of the decertification, an e-mail alleging improprieties in the election process and suggesting that Hysen may have had access to voting information was sent over the UC-general e-mail list from the official presidential account ucpres@fas.harvard.edu with the subject line “A Message on the Election from UC Vice President Kia McLeod.”
Though McLeod claimed in a follow-up e-mail from her own account that she did not draft the original e-mail, it was later discovered that she did personally approve and send the messages—written by former UC members Tamar Holoshitz ’10 and Schwartz—leading the UC to censure her for abusing the powers of her office.
Though its resolve was tested by the tumultuous events of the presidential election, UC members say that the Council has emerged relatively unscathed and more productive than ever, proving the resilience of this Council’s renewed aspirations to serve the student body.
“We’re hoping that people will look at [our work] as our legacy moreso than a week of embarrassing drama,” says Student Initiatives Committee Chair David Gonzalez ’11.
A FRESH START
Last year’s battle between Schwartz and Flores left lasting divisions in the Council, according to Adams House representative Harry T. Rimalower ’10.
Flores says the Council approached this year with a fresh perspective, kicking off the school year with a UC retreat to give all incoming Council members the chance to discuss the upcoming semester.
“We finally accepted [the negative perceptions of the UC] on campus, and it helped us unify,” says Flores. “We became unified against the perception that we were unproductive.”
In addition, members say the new constitutional changes enacted at the beginning of the fall, which increased the number of representatives and committees, played a large role in altering the tone of the Council. For example, some say that having five committees is less polarizing than the previous two-committee structure.
“A lot of votes [last year] were divided between the [old] Student Activities Committee and FiCom,” says Cabot House representative Manuel J. Antunes ’11.
Gonzalez says that the wider range of committees encourages representatives to focus on work rather than politics.
Overall, UC representatives say that this year’s Council—which Flores calls a “completely different organization” from that of her freshman year—has been far more cohesive, productive, and apolitical than in previous years.
By halfway through the fall semester, they had already surpassed the amount of legislation passed by the previous Council in one semester. They had fought for the ethnic studies secondary, established new lines of student outreach, and made progress on projects such as J-Term and social grants.
But the Election Commission’s turmoil and McLeod’s controversial e-mail elicited confusion and, in some cases, derision toward the Council from the student body.
“Adams Schmooze was filled with people saying ‘overthrow the UC’ and ‘burn and pillage’—and rightfully so,” Rimalower says.
Many representatives feared the drama of the election had significantly damaged the UC’s reputation. Some were especially upset because they felt the events did not reflect the current Council, but were rather a product of former members who had been involved in the  “partisan politics of last year,” according to Antunes.
“[UC members] were so upset that our work was going to be de-legitimized, that what students thought about the election was going to translate to what they thought of our work,” Flores says. “That was their biggest fear.”
REPAIRING THE UC’S IMAGE
Bowman, who was re-certified as the winning candidate by a vote of the Council the following week, says that the controversy surrounding the election has made it even more important for representatives to focus on their projects rather than dwell on past struggles to “repair the UC’s image.”
Antunes says Council members have made a conscious choice to put the fall’s events behind them.
“[The election] made us a much more cohesive body, because we all came together and voted to downplay the events and to move on,” he says. “What happened is an awkward cloud that still hangs over us, but we choose not to acknowledge it.”
Hysen says he believes this semester has been the UC’s most productive spring semester yet, with the introduction of new initiatives such as the men’s lacrosse tailgate and the student-initiated programming fund, as well as the passage of reforms to the EC in response to concerns about the election process.
The Council’s focus on achieving tangible change has helped it gain support among the student population, Hysen says.
According to a survey conducted by the Student Relations Committee to assess student opinion and the efficacy of the Council’s projects during the spring semester, 40 percent of students reported having a positive impression of the Council.
Though not all UC projects were successful this semester—the Council’s blog “UC Juicy” has only been updated three times since the beginning of March, for example—SRC Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11 says she believes the Council’s high approval rate is an “accomplishment” for the UC considering the current administration’s rocky start.
“If we had asked that same question right in November, it would have probably been much more negative,” she says.
Ultimately, Bowman says he hopes his tenure will be defined by his achievements rather than its controversial start.
“People will respect or not respect the UC based on how much it gets done for students,” Bowman says. “I think the UC’s reputation is...on track to be better than it ever has been.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were times when Ivy League men’s soccer seemed like anyone’s game. Harvard was hardly the only team with talent, and an Ivy title was never a sure thing.
But the Crimson knew its potential from day one and never lost sight of its objective.
“We set our goals at the beginning of the season,” senior Desmond Mitchell said. “One of our goals was to win the Ivy title. We constantly reminded ourselves of these goals. We had the team, we had the players.”
And in the end, Harvard had the result, securing sole possession of the championship with a 1-0 victory over Penn before advancing to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament for what was the team’s best finish in 22 years.
While the Crimson was never short on star power—co-captain forward Andre Akpan was first runner-up for the Hermann Trophy—its success hinged more on the leadership of the senior class as a whole and the team’s tight-knit atmosphere than it did on any one player.
“As a team we had a very tight bunch,” rising co-captain Jaren LaGreca said. “Everyone was doing the work for each other.”
“It’s more than just a team,” Mitchell added. “It’s become a family.”
The team’s five seniors, Akpan, defender Kwaku Nyamekye, and midfielders Mitchell, co-captain Brian Grimm, and Adam Rousmaniere, kept the team on track all year long. Having come to Cambridge on the heels of a 6-8-2 season, Harvard’s seniors never once failed to reach the NCAA tournament during their careers. When the team started to fall off track, with a 4-0 loss to then-No. 17 UConn and a 2-1 upset by unranked Princeton, it was the seniors who set the team straight.
“I give a lot of credit to the seniors for not letting us hang our heads or get too down on ourselves,” freshman Brian Rogers said. “They’re going to be really sorely missed. They were all starters, all impact players.”
After two seniors, Akpan and Nyamekye, led the Crimson to a season-changing victory over Dartmouth, the team’s younger three classes took Harvard the rest of the way to a league title, with Rogers, classmate Richard Smith, and junior Alex Chi scoring key goals in the Crimson’s final two conference games.
Arguably Harvard’s best game of the season was its last victory of the year when it defeated Monmouth, 3-0, in the second round of NCAAs. For the Crimson’s seniors, the remarkable run ended in the next round at the hands of defending champion Maryland. But while the seniors’ college playing days are over, their impact on the program is not, as the class raised the bar for Harvard soccer.
“We did really well—that’s something that we’d like to continue,” LaGreca said. “That’s where we hold our standards.”

Despite having a relatively young squad with only six seniors, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team managed to make a big splash in the Ivy League this year.
Completing the season with a 7-2 overall record, the Crimson dropped only one meet against Ivy competition, culminating in a second-place finish at the Ivy League Championships. With four athletes named to the All-Ivy team, the squad capped off the 2009-10 season in style.
“I think we performed better than last year,” rising co-captain Douwe Yntema said. “We had a good group of guys this year, and the few seniors that we had were very good and showed tremendous leadership.”
Harvard dove right into the season with a home meet against Texas A&M. Despite losing, 131.5-102.5, the team still had some successful individual finishes. Senior Mason Brunnick began with a win in the 500-yard freestyle. Freshman Owen Wurzbacher opened his Crimson career with a first-place finish in the 200-yard breaststroke, barely beating his teammates, juniors Justin Davidson and Evan Schindewolf.
Harvard did not let this loss set a precedent for the rest of the season. Just a day after the defeat against the Aggies, the Crimson traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., blowing Cornell and Dartmouth out of the water, 177-123 and 237-63, respectively.
Harvard captured nine events on the day and used this momentum to gain a  167-133 edge over Columbia the next weekend and finish off its New York tour.
“That was a real positive weekend, and it gave us confidence going into the rest of the season,” co-captain Tommy Gray said. “It was great to start out on the right foot.”
The Crimson faced stiffer competition at the Georgia Invitational, going up against Georgia, Auburn, Denver, and Florida.
Despite a fourth-place team finish, co-captain Alex Meyer emerged as a standout at the event, taking fourth in the 1,650-yard freestyle.
In the middle of its season, Harvard held a 3-1 record but needed to improve for the second half to match last year’s results. And then, from the most unlikely of sources, came a solidifying event for the squad: J-Term.
“Surprisingly, I’d say J-Term led us to come together the most,” Yntema said. “While everyone else was away, we were still on campus training very hard, and that allowed us to have a renewed focus and improve.”
“[J-Term] was the turning point of the season for us,” Meyer added. “After that, everyone was on the same page and we were more productive for the rest of the season.”
With this stronger team unity, the Crimson notched three consecutive wins, beating Ivy rivals Penn and Brown and trouncing the Boston University Terriers, 201-99.
Freshman Michael Stanton took the title in the three-meter diving competition against Penn and in the one-meter eventagainst Brown.
Coming off of these three wins, Harvard moved into the most anticipated part of its season—the competitions against its toughest Ivy rival, reigning conference champion Princeton. At the annual HYP meet, the Crimson dominated Yale, 242-106, but fell to Princeton, 203-150. It was Harvard’s first loss against an Ivy competitor on the season.
The Crimson rebounded from this defeat, taking second place at the ECAC Championships. Schindewolf won the 400-yard individual medley, while sophomore Nicholas DuCille claimed second in the 50-yard freestyle.
With this success, Harvard had another chance to take down the Tigers but again fell just short, taking second at the Ivy League Championships. Meyer had another solid performance for the Crimson, grabbing titles in 500-yard, 1,000-yard, and 1,650-yard freestyle races.
“We were a little disappointed we didn’t win the Ivy League Championships this year,” Meyer said. “Beating Princeton is a top priority, but we had some good individual standouts and performed well.”
Meyer continued this run at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships, taking All-American honors and 14th place overall with a time of 14:58.13 in the 1,650-yard freestyle.
With a successful season completed, Harvard looks to prove itself against a strong Ivy League field next year, especially rival Princeton.
“The plan is for all of us to improve for our individual best times,” Yntema said. “We have a renewed focus and a strong team for next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard for me to pinpoint the exact moment when writing sports for The Crimson no longer had anything to do with sports. Maybe it never did.
I, quite literally, stumbled across the Sports Board after a tremendous exercise in freshman stupidity turned me into one of those statistics that DAPA stamps on the Nalgene bottles they love to give out, and my mother bluntly declared, “You need a hobby.”
With this sage advice in mind, I trekked over to 14 Plympton Street and listened to members of various boards give their spiels before deciding on Sports, mostly because the chairs at the time seemed like—as the expression goes—“pretty chill dudes.”
Four years later, many of my best memories of Harvard stem from my involvement in Crimson Sports, rivaled only by recollections of my time in Kirkland House—the other cult I’m in.
But the moments that I remember with the most clarity and fondness are moments in which sport served as a conduit, rather than an end in itself, for uniting individuals who would permanently alter each other’s lives in ways they never could have imagined.
***
I remember taking the T to Boston College for the women’s hockey team’s Beanpot matchup with the Eagles during freshman year. I went with Jonathan Lehman ’08, who was the sports chair at the time.
The game was a triple-overtime thriller, one of the longest contests in college history, and a devastating 4-3 Harvard loss, but what stands out most from that night is the cab ride back.
Eager freshman that I was, I furiously typed out the first few paragraphs of my recap and showed them to my fellow traveler. Lehman looked over my (in retrospect) serviceable but average copy, gave it a nod of approval, and made a few suggestions.
It was a pretty unremarkable moment, but it marked the first advice I’d receive from a person who taught me more about writing—not sportswriting, but writing—than any professor I’ve come across at Harvard.
***
I remember sitting across from Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh in his office at the athletic complex in early March. We had just wrapped up a 45-minute interview for a feature I was writing about him for The Crimson’s annual baseball/softball supplement.
Walsh, who former Crimson writer Martin Bell correctly called a “walking embodiment of the mystical fabric that connects the games of baseball and life,” has a uniquely thoughtful, eloquent, and folksy way of talking that makes him a dream quote for any reporter.
On that March afternoon, he was his usual self, filling my voice recorder with a gripping narrative that brought his long career in baseball to life better than I ever could.
But it’s the conversation we had after the official, sports-related interview—the one that exists in no record outside of my own memory—that remains most salient in my consciousness.
As I gathered my things to leave Walsh’s office, I mentioned that I was reading a book for my thesis on the turbulent, racially-charged period of school desegregation in Boston during the 1970s. I asked Walsh, who grew up in Dorchester and long ago determined the letter “R” to be an unnecessary impediment to good conversation, about his experiences living in the city during that time.
After the 20-minute, anecdote-laden discourse that followed, I realized that I was talking to a personification of what the author of that book was trying to explain.
Walsh spoke candidly about the racial tension that left its mark on every corner of Boston, about his family’s connections to the local political machine, and how they knew the judge who ordered the city’s schools desegregated. But he also personalized the era in fantastic detail, musing about how he and his friends would sneak into the Boston Garden to see concerts; how Keith Richards and a Mick Jagger-less Rolling Stones barged into a hotel-room party he was at looking for booze; how black and white teens would play basketball against each other and how that diffused, but sometimes intensified, racial hostility.
It was a history lesson that, as they say, you can’t find in a book, and it happened because I was writing a sports story for The Crimson.
***
I remember the Crimson Sports staff joking about how my co-chair Dixon McPhillips and I didn’t even like sports. This may have been an exaggeration, but it’s true that we approached our jobs intent on delivering content that transcended athletics.
Dixon and I were a match made in...well, it depends whom you ask.
At our most benign, we urged our staff to write features that focused on the more human elements of sports, and Dixon made pushing Crimson Sports and The Crimson in general into the 21st century a personal crusade, trudging across the river every weekend—film equipment in tow—to spearhead our paper’s video efforts.
At our craziest (although we’d argue most genius), we terrorized Crimson designers with what some called our “cracked-out” ideas, like “Let’s turn the baseball/softball supplement into a graphic novel,” and “Can the spread for the Commencement issue be an art gallery, and can we be in it?”
(Luckily for us, the designers’ talent was even greater than their skepticism, and they brought out the best aspects of our concepts while reining in the more far-fetched.)
The creative bromance cultivated by a year as comp directors and another as sports chairs resulted in one more cracked-out idea—a musical that was performed in Kirkland this spring—that really did have nothing to do with sports.
But, as with my writing tutorial under Jonathan Lehman and my history lesson with Joe Walsh, sports were the common thread, the conduit through which it all happened.
So when I try to locate the exact moment when writing sports for The Crimson no longer had anything to do with sports, maybe I’m missing the point. Maybe it never happened at all.

The lights had finally gone out on the Harvard men’s soccer team, and the Crimson had just suffered a season-ending defeat at the hands of Maryland. But even the darkest moment of Harvard’s season couldn’t stop the Crimson from shining.
“It was one of the best seasons I’ve been a part of,” rising co-captain Jaren LaGreca said.
The Ivy Champions had earned the 10th seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Sweet 16 for their best NCAA performance in 22 years before falling to the reigning national champion Terrapins.
Harvard came out of the gates flying, winning its first six games and earning the No. 6 ranking in the country before falling, 1-0, to third-ranked Wake Forest on Sept. 26. The loss to the Demon Deacons didn’t cause the Crimson to veer off course, though, as the team picked up two more victories after the defeat.
But in a two-week stretch in October, two tough losses and one unexpected tie threatened to derail Harvard’s title hopes. Harvard tied Cornell, 1-1, on Oct. 10, and then suffered its worst loss of the season, a 4-0 defeat to No. 17 Connecticut, four days later.
After the loss, the Crimson responded with a 1-0 win over 15th-ranked Brown. Though the team followed its victory over the Bears by topping another Rhode Island school, Providence College, it would soon taste heartbreak again.
The third loss would prove to be the toughest. For the first time all season, the Crimson fell at home and to an unranked opponent when it dropped a double-overtime contest to Princeton. When co-captain Andre Akpan finally put Harvard on the board after 66 minutes of scoreless soccer, it looked as if the Crimson’s undefeated record in the Ivy League would live another day, due mostly to a strong outing from sophomore goalie Austin Harms. But 20 seconds later, the score was evened again when the Tigers’ Antoine Hoppenot ended Harms’ shutout. Two overtimes later, Hoppenot would strike again, sending Princeton home with a victory and Harvard back to the locker room with its Ivy standing in jeopardy.
But the next weekend, the Crimson turned around its season for good in another game at Ohiri Field.
“A lot of our success was [our] ability to bounce back from tough losses,” freshman Brian Rogers said.
For a team characterized by its senior leadership, it was fitting that seniors would catalyze the season-changing 2-1 victory over Dartmouth. Senior defenseman Kwaku Nyamekye broke a scoring drought of a little less than a year when he knocked classmate Adam Rousmaniere’s corner kick into the right corner of the goal less than five minutes into the contest. Just as in the past two games, Harvard surrendered the lead when Lucky Mkosana pulled the Big Green even at 55:26. But this time, the Crimson responded when co-captain Brian Grimm kicked a deep ball that was recovered by Akpan, who beat two Dartmouth defenders for the game-winning goal. Nyamekye later sealed the deal with a defensive save.
“That win got us back on the right path,” Rogers said. “That’s what the seniors and the leaders are supposed to do, and they did.”
Harvard wouldn’t lose again until the NCAA Sweet 16. The weekend after it topped the Big Green, it was the Crimson’s turn to rally from a one-goal deficit at Columbia, as Rogers and junior Alex Chi scored to give Harvard the game, keeping its league title hopes alive. The next weekend, the Crimson accomplished its mission when another rookie, Richard Smith, scored the game’s lone goal against Penn to give Harvard the Ivy title.
“At the end of the year, we became extremely focused,” senior Desmond Mitchell said.
Peaking at the right time, the Crimson rolled to a 3-0 victory over Monmouth in the second round of the NCAA tournament before falling to Maryland in the third round.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the outset of the 2009-10 season, expectations were high for Harvard women’s swimming and diving. The defending Ivy League champions had their eyes on a repeat performance.
Though the team may have fallen shy of that goal, the Crimson still managed to rise to the occasion this winter.
From start to finish, Harvard delivered solid performances that allowed the team to consistently keep pace with its competitors. When the season drew to a close, the Crimson had posted a 6-1 Ivy dual meet record and produced eight All-Ivy swimmers and one All-American—co-captain Alexandra Clarke. Losses to Princeton at HYPs and the Ivy League championships left the sole blemishes on Harvard’s otherwise spotless Ivy record.
The Crimson set the bar high early in its November debut against Dartmouth and Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. Freshman diver Brittany Powell led the way with titles in the one- and three-meter events. Junior Christine Kaufmann touched the wall first in the 200-yard and 500-yard freestyle races as well. Harvard ousted the Big Red, 166-129, and the Big Green, 203-82.
The following weekend, the Crimson once again asserted its dominance, defeating Columbia, 182-107, at the Harvard Invitational. Clarke came out on top in both the 500-yard and 1,650-yard freestyle. Juniors Katherine Pickard, Katy Hinkle, and Kate Mills and freshman Mackenzie Luick all posted multiple first-place finishes, leading the Crimson to victory in 17 out of 20 events.
Harvard welcomed the new year with a pair of wins over Penn and Brown in January. The Crimson not only defeated the Quakers in every event, but also broke three pool records in the process. Harvard then captured all 13 events against the Bears two weeks later, defeating Brown, 177-66.
“A lot of great things came out of this season,” said Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski ’92. “Following a year when we had 12 or 13 school records broken with [the advent of new body] suits, we ended up breaking four records this year without them.”
With Harvard’s momentum and morale riding high, the stage was set for the team next’s challenge—HYPs. While the Crimson was able to clinch a 180-120 win against Yale at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J., it faltered, 190-102, against the Tigers, a team that would push Harvard to its limits for the remainder of the season.
But the quartet of freshmen Kelly Robinson and Ellie Johnson and juniors Ali Slack and Hinkle gave the team reason to celebrate with a win in the 400-yard freestyle relay. Junior Jenny Reese also drew victories in both diving events to maintain a close race with Princeton.
After a month-long hiatus from competition, the Crimson was ready to redeem its earlier loss to the Tigers, as Harvard hosted the Ivy League Championships at Blodgett Pool.
Following three days of racing, the Crimson found itself a close second behind Princeton in the points standings. On the second day of competition, Clarke and Kaufmann went one-two in the 1,000-yard freestyle, landing Harvard its first event title of the meet.
But the overall title would literally boil down to the final few races. In the end, the Tigers emerged victorious by a narrow margin of 27 points above Harvard’s 1,438. That same weekend, the Crimson suffered another close loss at the ECAC Championships in Pittsburgh, Pa., to first-place Marist.
But the two second-place finishes were not without their highlights, as both Clarke and Mills qualified for the NCAA Championships in Minneapolis, Minn.
At NCAAs, Mills took 27th place in the 200-yard butterfly and 64th in the 200-yard freestyle. Clarke locked in a 16th-place finish in the 1,650-yard freestyle to attain All-American status—the first female Harvard swimmer to accomplish the feat since 2007.
“I was really happy with the end of the season and getting top-16,” Clarke said. “Coming off a championship last year, [this year’s results] weren’t exactly what we wanted, but we set a great foundation. It was one of the more memorable seasons for me because our team was so close.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adjusting to playing any sport at the collegiate level can be a bumpy transition for a rookie.
But freshman forward Brian Rogers was immediately at home on the soccer pitch, dominating in the offensive third in his first year on the Harvard squad.
“Rogers did an incredible job,” rising co-captain Jaren LaGreca said. “Coming to the team and making an impact like he did is pretty difficult, [but he] came up big.”
Playing in all 19 games and starting in 15, Rogers instantly made his presence known on the field. He immediately showed that he was ready to compete, amassing a six-game point streak and scoring a goal in three consecutive matches early in the season. He would go on to score a total of six goals and have six assists for the Crimson, ranking fifth in the Ivy League and second for Harvard in goals and points.
Rogers’ contributions have already helped him earn numerous awards, including being named to the All-Ivy Second Team, Soccer America All-Freshman Second Team, College Soccer News All-Freshman Second Team, and NSCAA All-Northeast Region Third Team.
He was also selected to be one of the “100 Freshmen to Keep an Eye On” for 2009 by College Soccer News, named the conference Rookie of the Week three times in the fall, and honored as the Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
Rogers defers to his teammates for helping him feel comfortable on the pitch.
“I was a little nervous...making the transition to playing the sport at the collegiate level,” he said. “But the coach and staff and the upperclassmen really made it a pretty smooth transition for me and...the rest of the rookies on our team...I have to commend my teammates for making me feel comfortable and having a lot of faith in me.”
Especially helpful to Rogers was co-captain Andre Akpan, Harvard’s all-time leading scorer and a recent draft pick of the Colorado Rapids.
“We had a great relationship,” Rogers said. “[Akpan] definitely helped mentor me and helped me to make the transition. It was an ideal situation to come and have him there.”
With Akpan gone next season, there will be more pressure on Rogers to build off of the success of his freshman year and to continue capitalizing on his goal-scoring opportunities. But his teammates have confidence in the rising sophomore’s ability to carry the offense.
“Brian Rogers did really well [and] really stepped up,” senior midfielder Desmond Mitchell said. “He has a very promising future, [and we’ve] really seen him develop from day one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard baseball took its season down to the wire with its last day of conference competition determining final positioning, but crucial losses ultimately kept it out of postseason play.
“Any time you get a chance on that last day, you’ve got to feel good about that,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “I wish we could have had more games to see how it would have ended up.”
The squad ended the season with a 17-26 record, going 10-10 in Ivy League play. Harvard’s overall winning percentage was an improvement from last year’s mark of .317, while its conference record remained the same.
“As a whole, I think the season was an improvement from the last few years,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “Baseball is all about progress, so this season was good for us.”
The Crimson’s pitchers, touted as one of the team’s biggest strengths at the beginning of the season, proved their skill early and produced strong, if not consistent, defensive numbers.
“Our pitching was better than the ERAs show, but we struggled with inconsistency,” Walsh said. “Sometimes you go out there and you’ve got it, and then the next day you don’t.”
Harvard’s hurlers were led by sophomore southpaw Brent Suter, who posted an Ivy-best 4-0 record and 33 strikeouts in 33.0 innings, allowed only seven walks, and was nearly flawless against left-handed batters.
“Brent really left it all out on the field,” Albright said. “We’re excited to have him returning, because we know he’ll be solid for us in the future.”
Junior Eric Eadington also contributed to the Crimson’s efforts on the mound with four wins after returning from an arm injury that put an early end to his season last year.
Underclassman pitchers such as freshmen Andrew Ferreira and Joey Novak and sophomores Connor Hulse, Will Keuper, Jonah Klees, and Marcus Way all had strong appearances on the mound as well.
“Many of the young guys did great, but they have to learn to hold on a little better,” Walsh said. “They kept getting behind in the count, and we just can’t do that in close games.”
Harvard’s young pitching staff was able to gain important experience throughout the season, and it provides promise for future years.
“A lot of them got to see a lot of game time this year and were able to really see how important every single game is,” Albright said.
Despite recording its best start in three years, the Crimson struggled early on the road, at one point dropping eight games in a row.
As Harvard returned to the Northeast, it picked up some close wins before opening conference play against Princeton.
The Crimson went 1-1 in its doubleheader against the Tigers and continued the trend, splitting matchups against five of its seven Ancient Eight opponents.
Despite the constant splits, Harvard’s contention for a spot in the Ivy League Championship series came down to its final four-game series against Dartmouth. The Crimson swept the Big Green at O’Donnell Field in the first twinbill with strong pitching by Eadington and Suter and powerful hitting by the majority of the lineup.
But despite continued success at bat, Harvard failed to put all of the pieces together the next day in Hanover, N.H., and its opponent clinched the division title again.
“We took the Ivy League down to that last day against Dartmouth, and if we gotten those two more wins we would have won our side,” Albright said. “We had really started to hit well at the end.”
Sophomores Jeff Reynolds and Way and freshman Kyle Larrow emerged as offensive powerhouses for the Crimson, while juniors Albright, Dillon O’Neill, and Sean O’Hara maintained consistent excellence at the plate.
“O’Hara had a solid season as always, and a lot of our success is a tribute to Albright and his leadership,” Walsh said.
One of only three seniors on the team, Dan Zailskas also provided steady hitting all season along with a solid presence at first base throughout his career.
“He’s one of those guys that likes to go all out, and even with an injured hamstring he had a great season offensively and defensively,” Walsh said.
Fellow fourth-years were also limited by injuries, but returned to help Harvard late in the season.
Chris Rouches overcame a broken hand to contribute an .833 average with runners in scoring position, while Jonathan Strangio battled what could have been a career-ending injury to throw over three innings of one-run relief in the last game of the season.
“We of course wanted to be able to use them more, and we’ll miss all of them,” Albright said of the seniors.
But with most of the Crimson’s lineup returning next year, the team’s outlook is optimistic.
“I wish it were next season already,” Walsh said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Dec. 2, 2009, the small world of Ivy League squash was thrust into the national spotlight. The Harvard men’s and women’s teams traveled to Hanover, N.H., where they were greeted with a barrage of profanity-laced abuse from a section of the Dartmouth crowd. An article in the Valley News, a local New Hampshire paper, described the episode, and the story blew up from there. The match received so much attention that Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim issued an apology to Drew Faust for the incident.
At first, some media outlets took a humorous approach to the reporting of the story, painting a picture of oversensitivity and overreaction. Dartmouth junior and varsity soccer player Bryan Giudicelli, who was involved in the heckling, claimed that asking Crimson co-captain Frank Cohen if he liked bagels was only a reference to the fact that Cohen was being shut out at the time. “There was no anti-Semitism behind that,” Giudicelli said.
But further details of the crowd’s behavior suggest that it was not simply a big misunderstanding. It is difficult to see how, “Cohen, do you cheat at business too?” could have been a reference to the score. In addition, taunts of “fag” and “cocksucker” were hurled at the Harvard men, while members of the women’s team were called “sluts” and “whores.”
Giudicelli said that he and his soccer buddies were simply trying to recreate the harsh atmosphere they faced in road games and didn’t realize how their actions would appear in the context of squash.
It might just be my opinion, but I would offer Giudicelli some advice: homophobia, chauvinism, and anti-Semitism are not appropriate anywhere.
Now I must admit, I have a personal attachment to this episode of heckling gone too far. Frank Cohen is my roommate, and I am close friends with a number of other players on both the men’s and women’s squash teams. So yes, I took an interest in this incident as a friend.
But also, as a passionate sports fan, I have a stake in the larger issue of fan behavior.
I have been an ardent sports fan for as long as I can remember. When waking up early before school, most six-year old kids watch cartoons. I watched SportsCenter.
When one of my favorite teams is playing, you can usually find me screaming at the TV. Perhaps this is a function of parent indoctrination—my father taught me the J-E-T-S chant as soon as I was able to utter my first words—or perhaps it comes from living in London, where the fans at Tottenham’s White Hart Lane spend the entire 90 minutes of a match in unified song. Either way, I know what it means to root hard for your team.
Home-field advantage can be a major factor in sports. Crowds can swing games, even seasons, through support for their team. Sportswriters love using metaphors, and perhaps the most widely used is that of the crowd acting as an extra man on the field or court.
I understand that part of this advantage is acquired by creating an inhospitable environment for the visitors. Fans do not need to be censored, for example, when booing a visiting player shooting a free throw.
Far too often, though, fans seem to descend into unwarranted personal attacks. At their best, these jibes may get a few chuckles despite their immaturity and arrogance; at their worst, they cross into the territory of hate and prejudice.
Sports fans like to refer to their teams in the first person. After a big victory, we exclaim, “We destroyed them.” Casual observers may not understand, but it makes sense to us die-hards. Forget even the crowd’s massive impact on each game; professional teams simply could not exist without the financial support of their fans.
But in using first-person pronouns, we are accepting a responsibility as well. When we sit in the stands, we represent our team. When we show up at Harvard Stadium, Lavietes Pavilion, or Ohiri Field, we represent the institution of Harvard.
I’ve had the privilege of attending my fair share of Harvard sporting events—some as a writer, others as just a fan. For the most part, the Crimson faithful has been respectful. The vast majority of games conclude without serious incident. But the unfortunate truth is that Giudicelli’s characterization of the hostilities he faces on the road could certainly apply to some of what I’ve seen and heard.
Just as Jeremy Lin has had to deal with racist anti-Asian remarks when the basketball team plays away, some of Harvard’s visitors have had to endure insults that have ranged from xenophobic—chants of “U.S.A.” directed at a foreign squash player—to homophobic—a soccer parent yelling, “Hey number 13, you’re a faggot.”
These are the most egregious examples of heckling gone overboard, and thankfully, they have been extremely rare.
Fairly regularly, though, I witnessed much less severe heckling that, nonetheless, I still would have preferred been left at home. While this different, more casual brand of heckling may not be quite as politically offensive, it still reflects poorly on a fan and his community. Comments don’t have to be racist to be immature and misguided.
We’ve all seen it: that one, loud fan who taunts a specific opponent. “Nice hair, Jones,” he yells, in his high-pitched voice that carries. He never lets up and usually recycles the same jokes as he continues to chirp at the target player. Meanwhile, he’s encouraged by his snickering friends, who are doing everything they can to track down the name of the player’s mother or sister.
If you are like me, you are endlessly annoyed and embarrassed by these fans. Just as number 13 leaves Cambridge with the impression that we are a bunch of homophobes, the hypothetical Jones leaves thinking that Harvard breeds prepubescent bullies.
If you are one of these hecklers, I’m sure you will counter by contending that you are doing whatever you can to help Harvard win. Perhaps. But there’s a right way and a wrong way to rattle an opponent. A high volume of noise is far more effective than a few snide remarks.
By no means am I arguing against cheering. In fact, I believe the entire crowd should be chanting nonstop. But as a fellow fan, I just ask that you show some respect while doing so—respect for the opponent, respect for the institution of Harvard, and respect for yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before assuming her role as Dean of the College in June 2008, Evelynn M. Hammonds served as senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity, advising University President Drew G. Faust on issues of faculty diversity. So when Hammonds had the chance to appoint two new House Master couples to Winthrop and Pforzheimer Houses within seven months of assuming the deanship, diversity was naturally one of her top priorities.
In February 2009, she appointed Harvard Law School Professor Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and lecturer Stephanie Robinson as Masters of Winthrop House—the first African-American House Masters in Harvard’s history.
By the end of the year, three more sets of resignations arrived at Hammonds’ desk, and once again, she had the opportunity to make her commitment to diversity a reality, naming Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana, who is Indian, to head Cabot House.
In the same announcement, she appointed Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature Professor Christie A. McDonald to lead Mather House, increasing the number of female Masters—as opposed to co-Masters—to three.
One month before that, Hammonds also selected HLS Professor James L. Cavallaro ’84 and his wife Nadejda Marques, who is Hispanic, to hold the spots of the Currier House Masters while they are on sabbatical next year.
The majority of Hammonds’ appointments demonstrate a push toward diversity that reflects the increasing heterogeneity of the faculty. Though this diversity might not have a tangible effect on the lives of House residents, administrators say they still seek to foster as much diversity as possible among the cadre of Masters and in the broader faculty as well.
AN INCREASING MIX
Although only a seemingly small number—three, to be exact—of next year’s 26 permanent House Masters are racial minorities, the makeup of the House Masters mirrors the ethnic composition of the tenured University faculty.
While 13.5 percent of tenured faculty members—the primary requirement of being a House Master—identify as non-white, 15.4 percent of next year’s House Masters are non-white.
According to several of the Masters, this increase in diversity can be attributed to Hammonds’ heightened attention to the issue and her success at marshalling diverse candidates.
“I think it’s probably the most diverse group ever,” Sullivan says of next year’s collection of House Masters.
Diversity was just one of many factors Hammonds says she considered.
“The primary thing for House Masters, in my view, was not whether or not I wanted diverse House Masters—that seemed to be almost a given—but rather the people who I picked would be people who would be really committed to bringing their various interests into the work of building a House community,” she says.
THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY
Diversity—not only racial, but also religious, intellectual, cultural, and socioeconomic—is widely acknowledged as an asset at Harvard and its peer institutions.
It increases the number of different perspectives on any situation, raising the likelihood of innovation and making the organization stronger and more resilient, says Harvard Business School Professor David A. Thomas, who specializes in cultural diversity in organizations. While other dimensions of diversity are important, he says race continues to be one of the most difficult to attain.
But opinions differ on whether diversity is particularly important among the collective group of House Masters. Although administrators, Masters, and students generally acknowledge that more diversity is better, some say their individual attitudes toward diversity may be more important than the diversity of the House Masters as a whole, as most students will interact with only their two House Masters.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor and former dean of the College, says that while diversity in classes and clubs gives students more opportunities to interact with people of different races and backgrounds, in the case of House Masters, “that principle is inoperative because you only see one Master.”
For Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck—who was appointed by Lewis in 1998 along with her partner Dorothy A. Austin—diversity “matters greatly” but “it matters even more who they choose.”
“I think the most important thing among House Masters is not only the diversity among the Masters but the ability of the Masters to foster engagement of students of all kinds within the House,” says Eck, who is part of the first same-sex couple to head a House.
Sullivan echoes this sentiment, saying that while diversity should be a priority, it is just one among many factors that Hammonds should consider when selecting Masters.
“I don’t think there is some uniquely African-American way to master a House,” Sullivan says. “But ethnic diversity is one quality among a host of qualities that Stephanie and I bring to the House that we hope enhances student life.”
Still, others say that more work remains to be done to bring diversity to the House community.
“Harvard is not nearly as diverse a place as it should be at any level—faculty, deans, staff, House Masters, and resident tutors—and we need to do a lot more work,” says J. Lorand Matory ’82, chair of Duke University’s Department of African and African American Studies and a former Harvard AAAS professor.
A PROLONGED PROCESS
The relative homogeneity of the faculty remains a barrier to further diversifying the group of House Masters.
Since House Masters must be tenured Harvard professors, Hammonds’ pool of minority candidates is limited in scope but may increase as the University’s efforts to diversify the faculty continue.
Currently, 24.7 percent of non-tenured professors are minorities, a striking difference from the 13.5 percent of minority tenured professors. As these minorities ascend the academic ladder and some receive tenure, the number of minority full professors is bound to increase, especially when bolstered by efforts to recruit diverse faculty from other institutions.
Michèle Lamont, senior adviser to the dean on faculty development and diversity, has asked departments to develop mentorship programs for junior faculty in hopes of helping them navigate the tenure process.
Knowing that the proportion of racial minorities among non-tenured professors is higher than among full professors, she says she has met with Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, the divisional deans, and faculty members from underrepresented groups to discuss issues of diversity, and has since held informal meetings for minority faculty members.
Although administrative efforts have successfully increased the number of minority professors over the past 20 years, these advances take time, says Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67. A change in the makeup of the senior faculty will take years to affect the composition of the House Masters, he says.
And even as the tenured faculty becomes more diverse, Palfrey says these minority faculty members must be interested in taking on all the responsibilities of leading an undergraduate House, which can be difficult to balance with academic commitments.
“They just may not want to share their life with 450 screaming kids,” he says.
But ultimately, the goal of bringing diversity to the House Masters goes hand in hand with the goal of bringing diversity to the College and FAS.
“This is such a key part of the mission of Harvard College,” says Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson. “It’s integral to our values.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though it let the Ivy League crown slip through its fingers this year, the Harvard men’s tennis team proved that it’s a team to be excited about. After strong nonconference play, the Crimson (14-10, 5-2 Ivy) suffered pivotal back-to-back losses in the Ivy League opening weekend, crushing its hopes early on for the conference championship.
“It was that first weekend out that we lost to Columbia and Cornell,” said head coach Dave Fish ’72. “It was the toughest weekend [in terms of difficulty] for any team to play.”
The squad, under the leadership of captain Mike Hayes, did an impressive job of forgetting. Unfazed by its losses, the team went on to defeat every remaining Ivy League foe and finish the season on a winning streak.
“We finished on a very high note.” Fish said. “I’m very encouraged looking at next year.”
Harvard’s starting team was comprised of two juniors, one sophomore, and three freshmen. With no departing senior starters, the squad looks to significantly improve.
“I think we’re going to have a stronger, more experienced team,” freshman Joshua Tchan said. “Our starting six guys are coming back, and we have a strong recruit coming in as well.”
“After [the freshmen] get one season under their belt, they’ll be better,” Fish added. “[This season] showed the coming talent of a very strong freshman class.”
Throughout the season, the young team showed flashes of brilliance. After competing in various tournaments in the fall, the Crimson kicked off the spring with a 1-2 showing in the Harvard Kickoff Tournament. In mid-February, the team headed to the ECAC Championships at Yale, where it came in first place, defeating Brown, Princeton, and Columbia consecutively.
Harvard then returned home to face a series of nonconference opponents, tallying a 4-4 record in that time and traveling to the Blue-Gray Championships over spring break. While it went only 1-2 at the tournament, the team had an impressive 4-0 victory over No. 44 Penn State.
“We just played extremely well at Penn State,” said Fish, who called it the team’s best victory. “Everybody seemed to be playing well that day.”
In Ivy League play, though it suffered back-to-back losses in the opening weekend, the Crimson rebounded with a five-match conference winning streak to tie for second place.
“The guys this year learned a lot,”  Tchan said. “We’ll get stronger over the summer, and [next year] looks very promising.”
Harvard’s lineup varied widely this year, shifting as players lost and gained momentum. Though junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans was a fixture at No. 1, the No. 2 through No. 6 spots remained flexible, filled in some order by junior Aba Omodele-Lucien, sophomore Alistair Felton, and freshmen Tchan, Andy Nguyen, and Christo Schultz.
“[The team] came very close to playing near its potential a few times, but with freshmen you tend to have ups and downs,” Fish explained. “We were very pleased with the way everybody in that group progressed.”
Fish also foresees improvement in the upperclassmen.
“I’m looking for [Alexei] to have a bigger year next year,” Fish said. “He’s shown he can compete with just about anyone, and he’s shown he can be a real No. 1 player...I look to see Aba come back and be stronger next year [as well].”
The Crimson was the recipient of three All-Ivy honors. Chijoff-Evans made the All-Ivy First Team for the second year in a row in singles, while in doubles the No. 1 pairing of Schultz and Omodele-Lucien made the first team. The No. 2 pairing, Felton and Nguyen, earned second-team honors.
The team says farewell to Hayes, who captained the team but did not start.
“Mike Hayes was a phenomenal captain,”  Tchan said. “He was the guy that, when times started getting rough, we went to for advice, and he did a wonderful job connecting the players with the coaches. We’re definitely going to miss him next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly two decades of unsuccessful attempts at knocking off Princeton, the Harvard lacrosse program finally had its way against the Tigers this season. For the first time since 1990, both Crimson squads defeated their Ivy League rival.
The women sparked the turnaround on Apr. 17, coming away with an 11-9 win, and the men followed suit a week later with an 11-8 victory.
Headed into its final home game of the season and coming off of a three-game losing streak, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team knew that pulling out a victory over perennial powerhouse Princeton, then ranked sixth nationally, could mark an important turning point for the team.
Sure enough, the Crimson’s 11-8 win over the Tigers on Senior Day at Harvard Stadium in front of a crowd of 2,827 fans, parents, and alumni marked a turning point not just for this year’s squad but for the entire program.
“It was important for the team and especially the seniors, because it was their last home game, and they had worked so hard for four years,” sophomore attack Jeff Cohen said. “They truly deserved that win.”
The Crimson jumped out to a 2-1 lead in the first quarter on early tallies from sophomore and junior attacks Kevin Vaughan and Dean Gibbons. Vaughan would go on to score two more times in the game, making him Harvard’s leading scorer on the afternoon.
In the second quarter, senior midfielder Jason Duboe opened up a three-score run for the Crimson, netting a goal with 6:26 to go in the half.
Sophomore midfielder Andrew Pataki and freshman attack Peter Schwartz each added a score of their own before the Tigers fought back with two consecutive goals.
But with 16 seconds left in the half, sophomore midfielder Terry White tallied a goal on an assist from co-captain midfielder Travis Burr, putting Harvard up, 6-4, going into halftime.
In the final two quarters, the Crimson never relinquished its first-half lead. Gibbons and Cohen each added goals in the third frame, making the score 8-5. Then in the final quarter of play, Vaughan netted two consecutive scores that, coupled with a goal by sophomore defenseman Evan Roth with 35 seconds on the clock, shut out Princeton’s hope of a comeback.
This win marked Harvard’s first victory over the Tigers since 1990, and in a season splintered by close losses to Ivy League opponents, it also showed that the Crimson could finish big games on top.
“The win was very important for our program, because it establishes that we can beat the perennial Ivy powers like Princeton and Cornell,” Cohen said. “It was great to see all of the alumni at the game who knew we hadn’t beat Princeton in [20] years. The win was for those guys also.”
On the women’s side, Harvard claimed an early lead and held on for the 11-9 victory, earning its first win over Princeton since 1992.
Sophomore Melanie Baskind and freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen led the Crimson offense with three scores apiece, while senior goalkeeper Katherine Martino anchored the defense with seven saves.
Harvard ratcheted up its defensive pressure, forcing 13 Tiger turnovers while holding the visitors to just three first-half scores.
“[The defense] played together today,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said after the Apr. 17 contest. “The defense took some balls away in midfield transition. We didn’t give [Princeton] what they like to do. We took away their running game, and I thought that was huge, the way the attack re-defended.”
The Tiger offense responded in the second half, notching four goals in less than 10 minutes to pull within two with 44 seconds left.
But as time wound down, Harvard’s defense managed to halt Princeton’s comeback, forcing a turnover and securing the team’s first win against the Tigers in 18 years.
And on top of the contest’s historical significance, the win held great importance for the 2010 Crimon squad.
Needing a win to keep alive hope of earning one of four playoff berths in the inaugural Ivy League tournament, Harvard came together when it mattered by defeating its higher-ranked conference opponent.
In the crowd for Alumni Day to witness the win were members of the 1990 women’s lacrosse team, who were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their national championship season.
“I just think that with all the alumnae there, it was a huge win for our program,” VanderMeulen said. “When we think back to the season, we’re going to think back to that day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I came to Harvard four years ago, I had no idea what college would be like. As a four-year high-school varsity athlete, sportswriter, and consistent spectator at all of our school’s games, I decided that college would be a chance for me to branch out and try new things. I was ready to be super academic and take a break from the whole sports thing.
Then I saw the stadium.
Everyone that had driven up for freshman move-in day was parked in a lot across the river behind the track until it was their turn to head to the Yard. As someone who had no intention of being involved in Crimson athletics as a pre-frosh, I had never ventured to the athletic complex before.
I had never seen the colossal beauty that was Harvard Stadium.
As we drove by the stadium, I couldn’t stop staring. My dad, who is not a man of many words, turned to me and said,“Wow, wouldn’t that be a cool place to cheer in?”
I was hooked. In less than a week, I had made the Harvard cheerleading squad, and a part of that beautiful stadium was officially mine.
In 40 years when I’m reminiscing about Harvard, I’ll remember that stadium more than anything else.
Executing awesome stunt combos that I had only seen before on TV, watching the coliseum fill with cheering fans at my first Harvard-Yale Game, having a football thrown to me on the sidelines after an amazing reception (thanks Corey Mazza!)—this is Harvard for me.
The stadium also has been much more than a place for me to cheer. I’ve made my best friends on those sidelines, as well as my best memories.
The stadium has even gotten my friends and me through some of our roughest breakups, because there’s really nothing that the 50-yard line and a bottle of Goldschlager can’t fix.
Although being a cheerleader and Crimson sportswriter has probably made me into the biggest DHA creeper on campus, this is a title that I don’t really mind.
Harvard athletics has gotten many of us through this competitive academic jungle, and for me, the stadium has been a huge part of that.
I’ve never been more proud of my school or myself than when I am in that sacred space, and Harvard Stadium and Harvard sports are everything that I have grown to love and cherish about Harvard itself.
So to wrap up a four-year career as cheerleader and sportswriter, there are only a few words left to say—Harvard rocks, Yale can suck it, and I’ll see you all next year at The Game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Evelynn M. Hammonds started her tenure as the Dean of Harvard College last year dealing with a massive power outage on the first day freshmen arrived on campus—the beginning of a string of difficult and unpredictable circumstances that would shape her first year as dean.
Over the course of the year, there were four student deaths, an alleged drug-related homicide in Kirkland House, and a financial crisis that led to University-wide staff layoffs and budget cuts.
Meanwhile, Hammonds faced a crisis of her own at home—her partner Alexandra was being treated for cancer, leaving her to care for both Alexandra and their young son.
The confluence of unfortunate, and in some cases tragic, circumstances would have been difficult for any dean—and for Hammonds, who had just been appointed, it was at times overwhelming.
Students complained that they felt they did not know the woman in charge, saying that Hammonds was disconnected from the student body. Many held her responsible for several unpopular decisions, including cuts to the shuttle schedule, the elimination of hot breakfast in upperclass Houses, and a restricted January Term.
But this year, circumstances are markedly different: there has been only one accidental student death, no homicides, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ financial situation has continued to improve. And while Hammonds herself faced a bout of pneumonia at the end of the spring semester, her partner’s health has improved significantly.
After what was, by all accounts, a tumultuous first year, administrators say Hammonds has found her footing in her second year on the job. Now as she works to define her priorities, she is increasingly able to push her own agenda instead of spending her days reacting to numerous campus and personal emergencies.
“She’s had the opportunity to be more thoughtful [this year] and not have to react to crisis after crisis after crisis,” says Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen. “She’s really starting to focus her attention on how she wants to prioritize things.”
LISTENING TO STUDENT VOICES
While Hammonds garnered criticism last year for being out of touch with undergraduates, the change in circumstances has given her more time to interact with students across campus this year.
Hammonds initially tried to reach out to students through a handful of group teas last year. This semester she took a different approach to reaching out, holding monthly office hours which gave any undergraduate the opportunity to speak one-on-one with her during 10-minute slots.
According to Associate Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin, Hammonds had more time in her schedule this year to interact with students: she attended a private dinner with the Crimson Dance Team last January, invited over 100 female African-American students and faculty members to a reception at her home last month, and attended student events such as the Adams House Fantasy Night.
“It was kind of cool that she came to it,” says Maxwell E. Storto ’11, who shook Hammonds’ hand at the event.
Although the dean has increased her visibility on campus, many students interviewed by The Crimson still say they have never met Hammonds.
But not all of these students interpreted the lack of contact as a sign that she is out of touch with students.
“I don’t think it’s necessary for me to know her personally for her to perform at her best,” Fabian A. Poliak ’11 says.
For many students, reading Hammonds’ e-mail correspondence is their main source of contact with the dean.
“Every time I see an e-mail from Dean Hammonds in the middle of the semester, it’s like, ‘Uh-oh, somebody died again,’” says Courtney L. Blair ’10. “Not that it’s her fault, but she shouldn’t be afraid to have more of a presence. When you get an e-mail from the Dean of the College, it reminds you that you’re part of this larger body of undergraduates.”
WHAT THE STUDENTS WANT
Hammonds says that her interactions with students have played a role in some of her decisions this year and the development of her long-term goals.
For example, one of Hammonds’ self-identified priorities is to address the issue of limited social space on campus.
“By the end of my deanship I hope that the administration will have found a way to solve the problem of more space for student organizations,” she says.
Hammonds specifically cites her interaction with students as the driving force behind her support for this issue.
“I was having dinner with some students [who said], ‘Dean, we need a no-work zone...we don’t have enough of them,’” she says. “After listening to this for a year and a half, I’m convinced that it’s an important thing for student life.”
Though she says it is unlikely that Harvard will acquire a new property for a dedicated student center, Hammonds hopes to spend time next year evaluating ways to reconfigure existing space.
Hammonds has also spent time this year planning for next year’s J-Term—the month-long break between the fall and spring semesters that debuted this year.
After discussions with student leaders and other administrative offices, the administration announced in April that the College will allow all students to return to campus a week before the spring semester begins.
While the change did not satisfy all of students’ J-Term requests, Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 says he believes the College’s decision is a direct result of the input they received from student leaders.
A COLLEGE COMMUNITY
In addition to cultivating a relationship with students, Hammonds has also worked to build the College administration into a cohesive community.
Administrators effusively praise Hammonds’ leadership abilities, which they say have earned her respect across the College staff.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson lauded Hammonds for her “egalitarian” and “collaborative” leadership style.
“She always has time for individuals and individual concerns,” Nelson says.
Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison says that Hammonds has endeared herself to her subordinates in the College administration.
“Evelynn is one of those people that people would do anything for,” he says. “She instills that kind of loyalty—people give it back in return.”
Aside from developing relationships with senior administrators, Hammonds has also made an effort to reach out to lower-level House personnel, such as resident deans and tutors, McLoughlin says.
Though some tutors say they have not interacted with Hammonds enough to formulate an opinion, Lowell House senior staff tutor Van C. Tran says that he would give Hammonds an ‘A’ for her performance as dean.
Tran says that some of the dissatisfaction with Hammonds among House staff last year may have resulted from inadequate communication, citing an incident where information was released to the student body before tutors were notified.
“She’s doing a much better job than before,” Tran says. “[Talking] to people at the Houses...is extremely important, and I think she came to know [that].”
‘A RESEARCHER AT HEART’
As Hammonds has had the opportunity to define her own agenda, her decision-making process has evolved to reflect her scientific background in physics and engineering as well as her academic research on the history and science of race.
“She likes empirical data,” says McLoughlin, who notes that Hammonds commissioned the undergraduate J-Term survey at the end of January this year in an effort to collect more information about students’ opinions. “I feel like in some ways last year she was a student and this year she’s like a researcher—back to her scientific inquiry mode.”
Nelson agrees with McLoughlin, calling Hammonds “a researcher at heart.”
In keeping with her background, Hammonds says that the undergraduate research experience is a priority for her administration.
“It is important for students in the the College to work with faculty on the research that [faculty] are passionate about,” Hammonds says. “Working with faculty on their research is one of the benefits of attending a liberal arts college that is embedded in a world-class research university.”
This year, Hammonds created the Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives, which will be responsible for managing the summer Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE). She also developed a similar social sciences summer research program—entitled Behavioral Laboratory in the Social Sciences (BLISS)—which is scheduled to be offered in summer 2011.
She says she ultimately hopes to develop summer programs for students in the arts and humanities as well.
Hammonds’ teaching background has also motivated her to push the College to reexamine its teaching style and incorporate “21st century” techniques and technologies into the classroom.
“We have a lot of classrooms that are frankly 19th century classrooms—chairs are bolted down and professors stand in front of the classroom and lecture,” she says.
Kenen says that college students today learn differently than how faculty members learned. “Our students are often referred to as digital natives—learn visually, learn using multimedia tools, learn using web,” she says.
Hammonds says that the College is currently conducting a review of the Derek Bok Center for Learning and Teaching, which provides pedagogical resources for faculty and teaching staff. She and Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith have also discussed the possibility of renovating some teaching facilities.
Hammonds’ colleagues say her range of experiences and education will likely define her tenure as dean of the College.
“She’s got a really interesting and unique trajectory that got her into this job, and I think she brings all of that to the table at all times,” Kenen says. “Those are the lenses through which she sees things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you put together a signature win over Duke, the third-best recruiting class in the country, and a preseason No. 12 ranking, expectations become almost impossible to meet.
Despite seeming to have a disappointing season on paper, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-6, 2-4 Ivy) took an important step in 2010 toward asserting itself in the static hierarchy that has marked Ivy League lacrosse for decades.
“I feel like this season was another step in the right direction after the success we had last year,” said sophomore attack and leading scorer Jeff Cohen. “When you go .500 there were clearly several disappointments, but you cannot measure a season only in wins and losses.”
After upsetting then-No. 5 Duke in the first game of its 2009 campaign, the Crimson began to garner attention, and people wondered what second-year coach John Tillman and the young Harvard squad would be able to accomplish.
Despite missing out on the postseason in 2009, the Crimson finished with a winning record for the first time since 2004, and its only three conference losses—to NCAA tournament selectees Brown, Cornell, and Princeton—were by a combined four goals.
The return of leading scorers Cohen and junior Dean Gibbons, in addition to Harvard’s heralded recruiting class, earned the team a No. 12 ranking in Inside Lacrosse’s preseason poll coming into 2010.
Despite the hype, the Crimson knew its path would not be as easy as some suggested. In addition to playing the five teams that defeated Harvard in 2009, the Crimson’s 2010 slate also included a Harvard Stadium rematch against Duke, which opened the season ranked No. 2 in the country.
The season began smoothly enough with a 16-6 victory over Canisius. The following game saw Harvard head to the nation’s capital to take on Georgetown. Although the Crimson led for the majority of the first half, the Hoyas used a 6-1 second-half run to put Harvard away. A late comeback fell just short as the Crimson lost, 13-12—the same exact score by which it lost to Georgetown in 2009.
The young Harvard team would prove its resilience, going on a three-game winning streak that included a 14-13 road victory over nationally-ranked Massachusetts.
In its first league game of the season, the Crimson was smothered by Brown early. Sophomore goalie Christian Coates allowed five goals in the first quarter while recording only one save en route to an early 6-1 Bears lead. Freshman goalie Harry Krieger stepped in for the last three frames and kept Harvard in the game, but another late rally  left the team in a quick hole in the Ivy League standings after the 13-11 loss to Brown.
After a victory against Dartmouth to even its league record, Harvard took a break from Ivy action to welcome Duke to Harvard Stadium on a Friday night that saw a record-breaking number of fans in attendance. But the bright lights didn’t faze the Blue Devils, who opened an 8-0 lead in the first quarter and coasted to a 14-5 rout.
The Crimson next traveled to Ithaca, N.Y. to face Cornell and overcame an early 5-1 deficit to take the lead in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter. Ivy League Player of the Year Rob Pannell fought back and took control for the Big Red, scoring the last two goals of the game to give Cornell the 13-12 victory over Harvard.
After being upset by Ivy basement-dweller Penn the following week, the Crimson returned to Cambridge for its last and most historic home game. Backed by timely scoring and a solid performance by emerging starter Krieger in the cage, Harvard upset Princeton, 11-8—its first win against the Tigers since 1990. The win put the Crimson back in the postseason picture, granting Harvard a win-and-in scenario with one game left at archrival Yale.
Despite taking a 6-3 lead in the second half, the Crimson was not able to withstand the staunch Bulldog defense and was held scoreless over the final 10:01 of the game as it watched Yale score two goals in the final nine minutes to win, 9-8.
Although the season finale left Harvard out of the postseason picture, the squad moved a definitive step closer to proving it can compete with the best, regardless of conference.
“We had some ups and downs [this season] and had our chances to make a decent season a great one,” sophomore attack Kevin Vaughan said. “Looking back, though, it’s most important to recognize the seniors and all they’ve done for the program in their four years at Harvard. That’s a great bunch of guys, and their influence will be felt for years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2010 season was a test for the Harvard women’s tennis team.
In 2008, under first-year head coach Traci Green, the squad went 2-17 and finished consecutive seasons with a losing record for the first time since 1980.
In 2009, forgetting its previous struggles, Green’s squad fought its way to a 13-8 record and tied with Princeton for the Ivy title with a 6-1 league performance. But Harvard lost the tiebreaker to the Tigers and therefore did not automatically qualify for the NCAA tournament, and its No. 66 ITA ranking did not land it an at-large bid.
The 2010 season presented itself as a test of whether last season’s success was a fluke. With the year completed, the team now knows the answer is a resounding, “No.”
The Crimson (14-8, 6-1 Ivy) began the season with a mediocre 6-6 record, due to a difficult schedule that included seven top-50 opponents, but turned its season around on its spring-break trip to the West Coast, winning eight of its last 10 matches to secure an at-large NCAA tournament berth, a second-place Ivy League finish, and a No. 39 ITA ranking.
“Since my freshman year we’ve improved increasingly,” junior captain Samantha Rosekrans said. “We’ve come together a lot more and become much more cohesive.”
After sweeping Boston University to open the season, Harvard lost to current No. 1 Baylor in the opening round of the ITA Kickoff Weekend.
In the ECAC tournament, the Crimson earned third place in the eight-team field with wins over Cornell and No. 33 Princeton and a loss to No. 44 Yale. The next few weeks also included losses to No. 22 Illinois, No. 26 South Florida, and a disappointing 7-0 sweep against No. 12 California.
But the loss to the Golden Bears served as the wakeup call Harvard needed to play up to its potential. In the next match against No. 38 St. Mary’s, the Crimson was trailing, 3-0, when it turned its season around.
Freshman Kristin Norton and sophomore Holly Cao each won their matches in two sets, while Rosekrans and freshman Alex Lehman both pushed their matches into a third set after dropping the first.
Lehman won her final set, 6-4, while the captain battled to finally win a contest-determining tiebreak, 11-9.
“We came out with a new mindset,” Rosekrans said after the match. “A new day meant a clean slate. We knew it would be a huge deal if we won...[The win] came at a crucial point in the season. It really boosted our morale.”
After its trip to the Golden State, the squad began Ivy League play and defeated No. 61 Brown, No. 44 Yale, and No. 60 Dartmouth en route to a 6-1 conference record. The only mishap occurred in Princeton, N.J., where the Tigers won, 5-2.
“We were hoping to win Ivies, but Princeton got the better of us,” Rosekrans said.
Despite its second-place finish in the Ivy League, Harvard’s ranking was good enough to earn it a berth in the NCAA tournament, in which it lost to No. 19 Georgia in the first round.
“It was a great honor to make the NCAA tournament,” Green said. “It was also a great learning experience for our team. We learned we can compete against nationally-ranked teams. Next year, we know that, and we can raise our goals and be prepared to win the first round.”
In addition to the team’s success, individual players earned accolades of their own.
Cao went 15-4 (5-2 Ivy) at No. 1, culminating in an Ivy-best No. 73 ITA ranking and a berth in the NCAA singles championships, which began yesterday.
Freshman Hideko Tachibana went 14-6 (6-1 Ivy) at No. 2 to unanimously win Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Both she and Cao earned unanimous All-Ivy First Team honors.
At No. 3, Norton went 14-7 (5-2 Ivy) and made the All-Ivy Second Team, while Rosekrans found her groove at No. 4 after the California match, winning eight straight matches before losing at Dartmouth.
Cao and Rosekrans teamed up to unanimously make the All-Ivy First Team in doubles, while Tachibana and Norton made the second team.
With this year’s successes, the Crimson looks to improve once again next season.
As a squad not losing any seniors to graduation and recruiting three incoming freshmen, the 2010-11 campaign holds high expectations for Harvard women’s tennis.
“Next year, I think we’ll be setting the bar higher and trying to maintain our top-40 ranking,” Rosekrans said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard women’s lacrosse coach Lisa Miller learned in January that sophomore Melanie Baskind would be dusting off her lacrosse stick to join the Crimson squad, the third-year head coach understood the level of talent her team was gaining.
Despite having taken a nearly two-year hiatus from lacrosse to focus on soccer, Baskind—a two-time All-Ivy midfielder for the Harvard soccer team—decided she was ready to take her skills to the lacrosse field once again.
Baskind’s decision came as pleasant news for Miller, who was familiar with Baskind’s days at Framingham High School, where the 5’3” midfielder was twice named an All-American in lacrosse and was considered by some as the top lacrosse recruit from the Bay State.
But coming out of high school, Baskind made the decision to focus solely on soccer.
That all changed in January when, just weeks after completing a standout sophomore soccer season which landed Baskind a spot on the All-Ivy Second Team, she chose to join Miller’s team.
While Miller was familiar with the midfielder’s talents, few could have predicted the immediate success Baskind would have on the lacrosse field.
The sophomore picked up right where she left off, starting at midfield for the Crimson in all 15 games and finishing the season second on the team in scoring with 32 goals and first on the team in ground balls and caused turnovers.
“In the beginning, we had heard about [Baskind], but we didn’t really know who she was,” freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “The second she stepped on the field, we had an instant respect for her.”
Baskind was rewarded for her strong performance with a spot on the All-Ivy Second Team, making her the only Harvard athlete this year to earn All-Ivy honors in two sports.
But notice of Baskind’s performance extended beyond the Ivy League, as the sophomore finished 21st in the nation in ground balls with 41 and 32nd in the nation in caused turnovers with 25, making her one of only four sophomores to finish in the top 35 of both categories.
While Baskind finished the season as one of the country’s top midfielders, the transition to lacrosse was not always so smooth.
With only a few times spent playing catch or practicing since her senior season of high school lacrosse, the midfielder had to fine tune her stick skills in just a few short weeks leading up to the start of the season.
“I think it was a little bit slow getting started,” she said.
In her first collegiate lacrosse match, Baskind did not exactly turn heads, finishing with no goals on two shots to go along with an assist in the Crimson’s season opener against Massachusetts.
But just over a week later, the sophomore had a breakout game.
Taking on Johns Hopkins, Baskind exploded, scoring a team-high four goals and picking up four ground balls to go along with three draw controls and four caused turnovers.
“In a month, she was back to her old self,” said junior Sam McMahon, who also played high school lacrosse in Massachusetts.
Things continued to go well for Baskind from there, as she notched the game-winning goal in double overtime three days later in Harvard’s upset win over then-No. 15 New Hampshire.
The midfielder stayed consistent over the remainder of the season but finished particularly strongly, closing out the year with back-to-back five-goal performances.
But while Baskind brought her individual talent to the lacrosse team, she also brought the experience of coming from a winning program, having captured the Ivy League soccer championship in each of her first two seasons.
“She knows what it’s like to play in big games,” freshman Danielle Tetreault said. “She’s always out there playing her hardest...It spreads throughout the team.”
Baskind’s next goal is to help bring the same success her team has experienced on the soccer field to her lacrosse squad.
“I’m just hoping that our team continues [to get better],” said the two-sport athlete, who plans on playing lacrosse again next season.
But before she can begin focusing on helping Miller and the rest of the Crimson lacrosse players win their first Ivy title, Baskind must turn her attention to the upcoming soccer season, where her team hopes to go for a three-peat.
“When I start moving again, it will probably be all about soccer,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just four years ago, many members of the Harvard community anticipated the newly-developed January Term as an opportunity for undergraduates to participate in a range of creative and exciting programming on campus.
Many envisioned that the month-long period—which was created as a result of the University’s new unified calendar reform that moved the fall semester’s finals from late January to mid-December—would provide students with opportunities such as briefly studying a foreign language or going on a trip led by a faculty member.
Instead, the inaugural J-Term this past winter was closed to most of the student body. Only those with a “demonstrated need” to stay in residence—such as varsity athletes, thesis writers, and international students—were granted housing, resulting in what many considered to be a generally subdued campus atmosphere.
The striking disparity between the original vision for J-Term and how it transpired this January was largely a result of the College’s effort to limit expenditures after the financial crisis in 2008 led to University-wide budget reductions.
But the differences between this year’s J-Term and next year’s J-Term will be more subtle.
While housing will still be limited for much of January, administrators announced in April that all students will be allowed to come back to campus for the last week of the break, during which time many student groups will also have the opportunity to host their own activities.
Though the decision is considered by many to be a modest change, student leaders and administrators are confident that the addition of a week in which all students can be on campus is an “experimental” first step in the gradual evolution toward a more structured J-Term.
A SLOW START
Despite the fact that the first J-Term fell short of the original expectations, administrators say the results of a student survey administered at the end of January suggest that the lack of organized programming did not necessarily ruin the J-Term experience for students.
Administrators point to the results of the survey—which was released to The Crimson—as an indication of “students’ overwhelming satisfaction” with the structure of last year’s J-Term, according to a message released to the College community by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
According to the survey, which was e-mailed to all students, only 8 percent of people who stayed on campus said they felt that the lack of programming was a problem, though no statistics regarding desire for programming were provided for students who did not stay on campus.
Although the results show that many students were content with their J-Term experiences this year, especially given the College’s financial situation, many say they would still like to see on-campus opportunities for students.
“I was pretty disappointed when they told us via e-mail that last year’s J-Term was pretty successful just because people had their own individual [plans],” says Maxwell E. Storto ’11. “It’s good that [the College] had something, but I wish they did move faster towards faculty-organized programming.”
In interviews with The Crimson, students who stayed on and off campus say that they would have benefitted from structured activities.
“Pretty much everyone I know was bored during the whole time period,” says Mark A. Terrelonge ’10, who stayed on campus this January to conduct thesis research.
And some students who were off-campus said they found the break too long to spend entirely at home.
“We found that most [students], by about two to three weeks into it, went stir crazy and wanted to come back and do things on campus,” says Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, based on his interactions with students.
A STEP FORWARD
Hammonds says that concerns raised by students and College administrators have led to the College’s decision to open up the campus a week earlier next January, which Undergraduate Council Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 refers to as an “incredible start” in the evolution of J-Term.
Many students reported that they faced a barrage of responsibilities when they returned to campus this year, such as summer application deadlines.
“We heard a lot from students and from various offices that [the beginning of the spring semester] was rushed,” Hammonds says. “It seemed like people needed a bit more time to come back in and settle down.”
In addition, many student groups felt that J-Term was a missed opportunity to organize their own activities.
“There’s a lot of potential that could be unleashed here if they said you have a month free to generate something really cool,” says Courtney L. Blair ’10, the former president of the International Relations Council.
In an effort to advocate for student-initiated programming during J-Term 2011, the UC and student group leaders submitted a position paper with detailed proposals for student group-organized activities.
While the College’s recent decision to open the campus earlier will not offer clubs the opportunity to host programs longer than a week, UC leadership says they see the decision as a positive step.
“I’m really happy that they opened it up for the last week of January because a lot of student groups really need that time. In general, it will help students to get back in the swing of things,” says UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11. “I think they really responded to our requests regarding that.”
Bowman says the Council will continue to push for more reforms next year.
“We are still trying to get Harvard to open up more of January to accommodate more student groups,” Bowman says. “But given the budget, we understand there are restrictions.”
‘EXPERIMENTAL MODE’
As the College considers its options for the future of J-Term, the proliferation of activities is partially limited by the unique residential structure of the College, administrators say.
“We are still in a resource constrained environment in the FAS and therefore the limiting factor for a full month-long winter break that involves extensive programming for all students is the cost of food and other infrastructure to support these activities.,” Hammonds says.
Hammonds, a former MIT faculty member, says she has extensively studied the school’s Independent Activities Period (IAP) as a potential model for Harvard’s J-Term. Some students say they are envious of the wide array of programs and activities available to MIT students during the IAP, which began in 1971.
During January, MIT offers approximately 100 for-credit, faculty-led courses and over 600 non-credit courses, which can be taught by any member of the MIT community.
For example, a material science professor has led a wine-tasting seminar during IAP for over 30 years, according to MIT Associate Dean of Academic and Research Initiatives Michael Bergren.
“[MIT] felt it was worthwhile to give both students and faculty the opportunity to step outside the fairly rigorous demands of the academic year and do something that is a little off the beaten track,” Bergren says.
But in contrast to Harvard, where nearly all undergraduates live and dine on campus, the majority of MIT students do not eat in dining halls, which cuts down on operational costs during the period, says MIT Associate Dean of New Student Programming Elizabeth C. Young.
“[IAP] really isn’t costing MIT anything extra,” Young says.
Despite the financial barriers to the rapid development of an MIT-like program at Harvard, some student leaders and administrators remain optimistic that formal programming will eventually come to fruition.
Palfrey says he expects that the College will expand J-Term programming to include a variety of credit and non-credit opportunities as well as additional funding for student activities over the next three to four years.
Bowman, who meets with top administrators monthly, says that “a structured J-Term is certainly something that administrators are looking at.”
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 says that many faculty members agree that there “is a wasted opportunity right now.”
But the final form of Harvard’s J-Term may not be determined for years to come.
MIT officials say that it will take time before Harvard’s J-Term program can define itself.
“Several years after its inception, IAP was considered an experiment,” Bergren says. “It’s cultural now, [but] we’ve got the benefit of four decades.”
Echoing Bergren’s comments, Hammonds says figuring out how J-Term can best work for Harvard will be a gradual process.
“We are still in the experimental mode,” she says. “I think we’ll have another year of thinking through what we would really like to see this evolve into in the future.”

A victor always has a target on her back.
After sharing the 2008 Ivy League championship with Princeton, the Harvard women’s soccer team took the field this past fall with the rest of the Ancient Eight clamoring to take the Crimson down. But last year’s win was no fluke.
Harvard (9-7-1, 6-1 Ivy) held off threats from all seven conference opponents to win its second Ivy League title in as many years. A 1-0 loss to the Tigers was the only blemish in the squad’s first outright Ivy championship in a decade.
“The Ivy League is so competitive,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said. “There is a target on everyone’s back, to be honest. Everyone takes every Ivy League game as if it’s the championship game.”
But before the wins, the trophies, and the NCAA tournament appearance, it seemed all too soon that the championship would be out of the Crimson’s grasp, as the team fell to five of its first seven opponents. Although all were nonconference games, Harvard’s players couldn’t clamor back from deficits on both the offensive and defensive ends.
“In the beginning of the season, we were trying to find ourselves as a team, and our record definitely struggled,” Nichols said.
The Crimson started the season with a tie against San Diego State before falling the next day to Connecticut, 3-1. A 1-0 win against New Hampshire, the only win in the preseason, came on Sept. 8, but the excitement was lessened by losses to Long Beach State, Hofstra, and Boston College.
Yet there was a silver lining in preseason play, illustrated during the team’s final game before the regular season. Facing local rival Boston University on Sept. 20, the Crimson again walked away with a tight 1-0 loss.
But this time, things were going to change.
“The BU game was the turning point in our season where we came together after that game and decided together that we were going to turn this season around and find the results that the team deserved,” Nichols said. “From then on, we went into the Ivy League season with a feeling of confidence and experience because of the challenging first half of the season we had had.”
In its first game as a reborn team, the Crimson held onto a 2-1 lead at halftime to beat Penn, 3-2. The last two nonconference games of the season, against Holy Cross and Fairfield, ended in similar victories for Harvard but this time with larger margins. The Crimson scored two goals against the Crusaders within seven minutes to win, 2-0, before besting the Stags, 4-1.
Harvard then reeled off three more wins over Ivy opponents. Cornell fell first, 2-0, followed by Brown’s 1-0 loss to the Crimson in overtime.
Harvard extended its winning streak, traveling to Yale for the second time after the first scheduled contest was cancelled midway through the game due to bad weather.
For other teams in the league, Harvard’s 3-2 win against Yale on Oct. 20 showed that the squad was finally finding its rhythm—and put the team in the driver’s seat of the Ancient Eight race.
“One of my favorite games was the Yale game, both times,” Nichols said. “That game was huge. It was an up-and-down game, a very emotional game. There were key moments, including when [junior defender] Katie Kuzma saved our season and saved the ball off the line towards the end of the game.”
The 1-0 loss against Princeton followed, but with a 2-1 win over Dartmouth on Halloween, the Crimson earned at least a share of the Ivy League title. One week later, after a 2-1 overtime win against Columbia, Harvard took sole possession of the crown. The excitement couldn’t last long, though, as six days later the Crimson faced its first opponent in NCAA tournament play— Boston College.
“We went into it with the mentality that we most definitely could beat them,” senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann said. “They were playing well, we were playing well. It was an unfortunate way to end. They scored in the first couple minutes of the second half, but we kept fighting up until the end.”
Harvard fell in the first round of playoffs to its crosstown rival, 1-0.
“I’m very proud that we did not stop fighting to turn that game around, never stopped until the whistle was blown,” Nichols said. “It’s always sort of disappointing ending the season on a loss, but I think anyone walking away from that game can say that they were proud of the way we had developed our team.”
For seniors Nichols, Mann, Christina Hagner, and Kelli Okuji, who in their first year as Crimson athletes won a total of three games, this season was still a winning one.
“It was something we joked about, but we never doubted that we were going to win an Ivy League championship,” Nichols said. “Every year we got closer and closer.”
And now they have two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 18, 2009, Justin Cosby, a Cambridge resident, was struck by a bullet in the chest after a drug deal gone wrong in the basement of Kirkland House.
That such an incident could happen at Harvard shocked the campus and the nation, attracting widespread media attention and inducing short-lived student panic.
But since the alleged drug rip and shooting, the student body, by all accounts, has put the incident behind them, dismissing it as an isolated event. Meanwhile, administrators have remained relatively mum on the potential security flaws exposed by the incident and their response to them, citing ongoing criminal investigations.
Three men who are unaffiliated with Harvard University and Brittany J. Smith ’09—a former Lowell House resident who was not allowed to graduate last spring—are currently facing charges related to the alleged homicide.
Despite Harvard’s silence, conversations with administrators and students indicate that the College is taking some small steps to encourage students to more closely monitor and control access to Harvard dormitories and drug use at Harvard. Still, it is unclear whether these steps came about due to the Kirkland shooting, whether Harvard has taken any major steps to prevent such an incident from reoccurring—or whether they are simply too nervous to talk about it at all.
ACCESS GRANTED
It was a Monday morning that would end in tragedy. Prosecutors say that three New York men—Jason Aquino, Jabrai J. Copney, and Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts—were at Harvard, ready to make some cash.
Smith, who was dating Copney at the time, gave the men her identification card, allowing them access to buildings across campus, according to Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85.
Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts made their way to Kirkland House’s J-entryway, where they swiped Smith’s ID, according to prosecutors. The orange light turned green, the door unlocked, and the three men entered. Somehow, Cosby gained access to the building as well.
All four men would leave Kirkland House, but only three would survive the day.
It remains unclear how Cosby, the soon-to-be-victim who has since been linked to the campus drug trade, entered Kirkland House. One possibility is that he followed a student who swiped into the Harvard dormitory, a practice often called “piggybacking.”
About two weeks after the shooting, a private investigator and his wife were accused of piggybacking into a Harvard dormitory to investigate the incident. The investigator was charged with trespassing after a student reported them to a police officer.
Without directly referencing the Kirkland incident, College administrators say they are working to discourage piggybacking by encouraging students to be more vigilant about who they let into Harvard buildings.
“None of us want to slam the door in someone’s face, but in some sense, you have to when you’re in an urban environment like this,” says John “Jay” L. Ellison, associate dean of the College, who is involved with addressing security concerns at many levels of the University.
Often, the burden of securing Harvard premises falls on students, according to Ellison.
“It is impossible to control full access to [buildings] except through the swipe cards,” he says.
But one of the obstacles to preventing piggybacking is that it would go against what administrators describe as Harvard’s culture of inclusivity.
Because undergraduates have become accustomed to holding the door for others, it seems rude not to allow another student access, according to Joshua G. McIntosh, associate dean of the College for student life.
McIntosh, who chairs the Harvard College Safety Committee, says the situation would be improved “if the cultural norm was we just didn’t let people come in behind us.”
College administrators say they are developing a campaign to encourage students to be mindful of who they are letting into Harvard buildings, but they will not say if the shooting is specifically motivating that initiative.
“I am not going to point to any one thing that motivated that campaign,” says Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
The Safety Committee is also re-evaluating how it communicates Harvard’s policies to students, according to McIntosh, but administrators say the re-evaluation is unrelated to the Kirkland shooting.
“I will be honest with you. This issue was independent of and not sparked by the Kirkland incident,” McIntosh says. “What motivated this more strategic direction is that we had 12 people in a room who thought it was an important thing to do.”
While they say that Harvard regularly re-evaluates its safety policies, administrators were unwilling to discuss what, if any, lessons were learned from the alleged murder inside Kirkland House due to the ongoing investigations.
“It’s an urban environment, and we hope that we can manage the unsafe things that might happen in our environment and we do that every single day,” says Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson. “That is something we are constantly engaged in.”
‘ASKING FOR TROUBLE’
After swiping into the Kirkland J-entryway, Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts made their way into the basement of the annex to meet with Cosby, according to prosecutors.
Cosby, who had previously been arrested on drug charges, is believed to have been a supplier of marijuana on campus. One student last year said a man who called himself “Justin” sold marijuana to him and other Harvard students. Text messages this student received from Justin advertised Jack Herer and Kali Mist, two popular marijuana strains. Further investigation showed that the text messages were sent from a phone tied to Cosby’s mother.
That day, Cosby seemed ready for a drug transaction—but, according to the district attorney’s office, Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts had no intention to pay.
In 2005, The Crimson reported that marijuana use at Harvard is “less likely to get [a student] in trouble than breaking a window.”
Two potential questions raised by the shooting are whether Harvard properly addressed drug use on campus before the incident and whether the attitude toward illegal drug use within the College has changed.
It is hardly a surprise that marijuana is consumed in a state that decriminalized possession of small quantities of the substance last year—it certainly isn’t to Steven G. Catalano, spokesman for the Harvard University Police Department.
“Harvard is no different than [any] other school or university with regards to the presence of drugs and alcohol on campus,” he writes in an e-mail. “We have always taken a hard line stance to drug distribution on campus.”
Administrators are unwilling to discuss the Kirkland incident, though they remain adamant that Harvard consistently enforces its policies prohibiting drug use.
Last week, Nelson defended the College’s policies regarding marijuana, including the degree to which they have been enforced by tutors.
“We have a perfectly good protocol, and we’ve consistently implemented the protocol and will continue to do that,” she says.
McIntosh, who edits the crisis handbook for House staff, says “the protocol didn’t change” since the Kirkland incident.
While HUPD may take “a hard line stance” against drug distribution, the individuals who oftentimes are the first to respond to drug use on campus—the resident tutors who populate every entryway of every residential House at the College—tell a different story.
Before the shooting, tutors sometimes turned a blind eye towards infractions seen as minor, but they have since been instructed to more strictly enforce Harvard’s drug policies.
“It’s sort of like a tree falls in the forest and if you don’t see it, it’s not happening,” Luciana Herman, a resident tutor in Quincy House, says about the attitude toward drug enforcement prior to the shooting. “There was a passive disinterest.”
But since the incident, tutors say the administration has instructed them to be more vigilant, in line with what Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 calls “a heightened understanding that where there’s any kind of drug activity that the connection to any criminal behavior is not far removed.”
“I think that after the event in Kirkland, we were all told that the University is concerned about this and that we should really remind students that engaging in drugs can be a very dangerous thing,” says an Adams House resident tutor, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of the subject.
After The Crimson began contacting House staff for this article, Hammonds instructed College staff not to comment on “issues arising out of the Kirkland incident,” according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal. House Masters, resident deans, and most tutors contacted for this article after last Wednesday morning declined to answer questions related to campus security policy, instead referring comment to Neal and Nelson.
While tutors may have been instructed to more strictly enforce drug policy in light of the shooting, it remains unclear what effect that has had. There is some evidence to suggest that drug use may have declined at least briefly after the shooting took place, but there are few signs that the campus drug scene has been significantly affected by last year’s incident.
“Right after it happened, no one was selling drugs on campus,” says one Harvard undergraduate who uses marijuana and asked to remain anonymous because he uses the substance. “Coming back in the fall, [buying drugs] was definitely harder than it was before.”
While the most recent statistical data made available by HUPD is from 2008, anecdotal evidence does not suggest that there has been a tangible change in drug use over the past year.
A survey of the class of 2010 conducted by The Crimson found that 34 percent of seniors self-reported using marijuana at least a few times a year or more.
Elizabeth Tang ’11 says that on April 20—a day when cannabis users often gather to smoke marijuana—she saw “a ton of people” in an entryway smoking.
Another individual, who is not enrolled at Harvard but says he sells to undergraduates, says he has always avoided selling inside of Harvard dormitories.
“I don’t go near the dorms. I don’t go near any of the Houses,” he says. “I don’t hang around with kids at the College or the University.”
“That’s just asking for trouble,” he adds.
A MUTED RESPONSE
Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts were about to engage in what prosecutors called a “drug rip.” Jiggetts, the district attorney’s office says, pulled out a 9mm semi-automatic pistol and handed it to Copney. Copney put his finger on the trigger.
At 4:48 p.m., HUPD received word of shots fired in Kirkland House, according to prosecutors. Residents in J-entryway said they heard three sounds akin to gunshots.
Cosby, with a bullet in his abdomen, stumbled out of Kirkland, bleeding as he made his way toward Mt. Auburn St.
E-mail lists were aflame. At about 5:45 p.m., roughly one hour after the first reports of the shooting, Harvard affiliates received a truncated text message via “Message Me,” the University’s emergency notification system. Due to the character limit of the system, the message cut off the second sentence at “Police ask people to remain indoors and avoi—” and did not reach two percent of the system’s 14,000 subscribers.
When asked about what improvements to security were made in response to the Kirkland incident, University spokesman Kevin Galvin wrote in an e-mail, “We don’t discuss the details of security measures.”
Public relations specialists and legal experts are divided on Harvard’s tight-lipped stance on discussing any subject related to the Kirkland incident.
Clarke L. Caywood, a professor at Northwestern University who specializes in crisis communications, sharply criticizes Harvard’s unwillingness to answer questions regarding any possible security reforms following the Kirkland incident.
“That’s unacceptable in a day of transparency, openness, and a need for confidence in the institution,” he says.
What various spokespeople, administrators, and experts have said paints a picture of a University not just hesitant to comment on a criminal case involving bullets fired within the serenity of an undergraduate House, but cautious to avoid using language that could bring about a civil law suit.
Harry King, a crisis communications specialist based out of Boston, says that the goal after such an incident is to reassure the public that steps are being taken.
These steps, though, may potentially identify past problems that could have contributed to the shooting, enticing victims—in this case, Cosby’s family—to sue Harvard, according to criminal defense attorney Stephen B. Hrones ’64.
Hammonds cites legal reasons when discussing the communication clampdown on House staff and limiting her own comments regarding any possible reforms due to the Kirkland shooting. While Hrones says he understands the rationale, he says assuring student safety should continue to be Harvard’s top priority.
In an interview, Hammonds—though she did not name any tangible steps taken since the shooting—affirmed that Harvard is a safe place for students to attend.
To criminal defense attorney and Harvard Law School graduate Keith S. Halpern, there is no “legitimate reason” he can think of when rationalizing Harvard’s silence, as he says he cannot imagine an alleged drug dealer’s family would sue the University.
Still, Harvard’s current strategy of limiting communication is not necessarily an improper one given current legal proceedings, according to other experts.
“You should probably be erring on the side of caution until the litigation and the prosecution is complete,” says Peter Morrissey, an associate professor of communication at Boston University.
The University must find the right balance between protecting itself from litigation and assuring the community that it has adequately responded to the incident and its security implications, according to King.
But for some students, Harvard is failing to achieve a proper balance.
“I haven’t really seen anything from the administration on what measures they are taking to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” says Anne C. Taylor ’11. “I’d say it affected my perception of how safe the campus is.”
Since Harvard officials are not speaking publicly about the incident, it is difficult to determine exactly what internal evaluations have taken place and what they have concluded about the security implications of the shooting.
“The HUPD feels the Kirkland House incident was an isolated incident,” writes Catalano, the HUPD spokesman.
Ellison, who sits on several emergency response committees throughout the University, would only discuss the University’s internal response to the shooting in general terms.
“To my knowledge, I don’t know that there have been any secret committees or staff positions created to deal with any one incident,” he says.
But Ellison says Harvard considers the implications of any emergency.
“We always have an after-action review, talk about what worked, what didn’t work,” he says. “That’s how you prepare for the next big thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For some student group leaders, Harvard just doesn’t get it.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds may have named it one of her top three goals, but when students clamor for more social space, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson—who leads the Office of Student Life—does not even mention the subject when listing her priorities.
While students complain about the difficult logistics of nightlife, Nelson praises Harvard’s alcohol policies as relatively generous.
But students and administrators both agree that the Office of Student Life should remain relatively hands-off, guiding programming run by students rather than engineering events for them.
While this freedom is extended to daytime events—such as conferences, panels, and meetings—the College’s reins tighten when the sun goes down, when the music starts blaring, and when the kegs are tapped.
“Their priority is for everyone to be safe, legal, and financially sound, and I appreciate all of the training they have for student group leaders. And they give a lot of support,” says Courtney L. Blair ’10, former president of the Harvard International Relations Council. “But where our priorities diverge is we also want to make our organizations social organizations.”
It is these divergent priorities that prove difficult for students and administrators to reconcile.
A QUESTION OF LIABILITY
Student leaders say they sometimes struggle to hold events that satisfy both Massachusetts drinking laws and their members’ desires for lax alcohol restrictions. Whereas the administration focuses on the former, student group leaders often emphasize the latter, bringing the two into inevitable disagreement.
“That’s always going to be a conflict that can’t be resolved,” Blair says. “You can’t blame them. That’s their job, and it’s our job to push back against the rules and not want to follow them.”
But some student group leaders point at certain restrictions—such as those involving Beverage Authorization Teams—as examples of a broader disconnect between the administration and undergraduates. According to some students, the administration’s attitude focuses on mitigating risk and minimizing liability for the College as much as possible, often at the expense of a typical collegiate nightlife.
“Harvard has a very strict ‘look out for number one’ policy in that respect,” says Thomas A. Johnson ’11, president of the Harvard chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. “They treat us like we’re children, like we’re all enormous liabilities—and quite frankly, that’s disheartening.”
In addition to requiring Harvard University Police Department detail teams to be present at events with 100 or more attendees, the Office of Student Life requires BAT teams at student organization events that serve alcohol, charging $21.50 per hour for a minimum of four hours. Nelson calls this policy “a great model” that allows for “the kind of responsible behavior that we want students and adults to have.”
However, this perceived focus on liability appears to limit the events allowed by the College, yielding activities that some find to be childish and sometimes preventing clubs from holding the events that they desire.
For instance, Qing “Emma” Wang ’12, co-chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, says the club tried to hold a party in mid-April in Adams House. After the College informed QSA that it had failed to meet the administration’s event registration specifications, the group was forced to cancel the highly-publicized event at the last minute.
“It would appear that things they would want us to do aren’t things college students would actually do,” says Lisa M. Yu ’11, co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association. “I think they have tamer ideas of what the student population actually is interested in.”
Moreover, according to some student leaders, these restrictions push social events out of common spaces and into dorm rooms, a move that could place students at a higher risk.
CRAMPED AND COMPLEX
If the problem of alcohol and liability is tough, many student leaders find the social space situation to be downright dismal.
Difficulties they encounter when looking for event space center around two main factors: a dearth of available but highly-demanded space makes finding meeting locations troublesome, and a panoply of varying regulations regarding access to spaces complicates the room reservation process.
The spaces—consisting of rooms in Yard buildings, the Houses, and the Student Organization Center at Hilles—each face their own limitations. The availability of classrooms in the Yard is restricted by the Harvard Extension School’s evening classes, and the River Houses each have different rules surrounding use of their common rooms, spaces which must be reserved using different systems.
Meanwhile, the locations of Quad Houses and the SOCH present a geographic deterrence. For this reason, no student group leader interviewed by The Crimson for this article said that the SOCH was a particularly useful space.
Although the Dean of Student Life did not say she counts social space among her goals, Hammonds says that social space is one of her top priorities and that she is exploring several options, including the creation of “no-work zones” for students.
Student group leaders have offered various potential solutions, including a proposal to standardize access to River House common rooms. The suggestion that emerges as the most common, though, is the establishment of a student center.
THE STUDENT CENTER
Joshua J. Nuni ’10, the president of the Student Community Center Foundation, has long wanted a student center.
A project in its infancy, the SCCF is looking for properties it can purchase and convert into an all-purpose center for undergraduates.
“We’re driven by how compelling this vision is,” Nuni says. “It’s what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to do something that is improbable but really cool and compelling.”
But however compelling the idea may be, the University finds itself recovering from the recent recession and facing an uncertain financial future, one that restricts its ability to engage in new capital ventures.
“We still remain in a financially constrained moment,” Hammonds says. “We cannot build a new student center right now.”
Student leaders say they support the idea, while acknowledging its pecuniary infeasibility. Given that Hammonds has said a student center is currently impractical, some suggest—and Hammonds says she is considering—a more limited option.
“I think the administration should just think about the spaces it already has and how they can differently regulate them,” Wang says.
LIBERTY FOR ALL
Nelson’s emphasis on “student-centered leading and student-centered learning” mirrors student leaders’ conceptions of the Office’s ideal role.
“Student life is about us coaching students to run their own events and activities. We have a real small staff, and that’s by design,” Nelson says. “The people who are supposed to be doing things are the leaders of the 400-plus organizations.”
Many student group leaders say they appreciate the freedom to manage their own academic programming while knowing that the OSL and its resources are available as support if necessary.
Both the leaders and the administration cite this independence as an opportunity for students to learn from the challenges they face.
“On the one hand, you can say they’re not supporting us, but at the same time, it’s a really good learning experience for us to sort through all of that ourselves,” Blair says.
And some of the OSL’s shortcomings could be due to the sheer mass of student groups, around 400 in total, Nelson says.
“They’re not always that helpful to us, but again, we can’t complain,” says Joseph P. Resnek ’11, a captain of the Harvard Mock Trial Association. “What are they going to do, help all 10,000 groups on campus?”
But according to Wang, the College’s main weakness continues to be its uncertainty about how to address an important aspect of most student groups’ functions—social events.
“I think they’ve done fairly well at initiating programming that has broad appeal that doesn’t include parties,” she says. “I think what they need to work on are the things that happen after dark, the ones that are inherently less safe.”
“It feels like the administration is kind of afraid to tackle it,” she adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rowing is a sport of repetition. Although an oarsman may achieve one perfect stroke, to repeat that flawless motion even twice, never mind over 200 times down a 2,000-meter race course in sync with seven other people, is a true feat. Fortunately, when it comes to racing, a crew just has to come closer to perfection than its opponent in order to win.
This past season, the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight programs made perfection their goal, and, while neither squad has had a blemish-free season, they have outperformed all of their opponents at some point this spring.
The Crimson men’s heavyweight varsity boat consisted of five sophomores, two juniors and one senior, as well as a senior coxswain, making it one of the youngest top eights coach Harry Parker has had in years. But youth does not mean inexperience. These oarsmen carried with them a sense of brotherhood they gained last year rowing on the freshman eight that took silver at EARC Sprints.
“They are experienced, they work well together, and they are fast,” senior coxswain Kelly Evans said. “And it was maybe to their advantage that they had no expectations about how fast they should or shouldn’t be. It was a fresh start for them.”
After defeating Cornell in its first dual race of the season, the Crimson fell to the Brown Bears in Providence, R.I. on Saturday, Apr. 10.  The Bears took first at Eastern Sprints last year, and another loss to Brown—this time early in the season—motivated Harvard to step up its training before it would line up again against the Bears at Sprints.
“In the fall at Tail of the Charles, our top three boats lost by an average of seven seconds to Brown,” said sophomore varsity three seat Mike DiSanto. “So Harry really challenged all of us to make up those seven seconds over the course of the winter on the erg. Then our loss to Brown this spring was a refocus point. It was the make-it-or-break-it point of our season. We wanted to get them back at Sprints.”
The varsity eight went on to defeat MIT, Princeton, Navy, Penn, and Northeastern before having another shot at Brown on Sunday, May 16 at Eastern Sprints in Worcester, Mass.
In the grand finals, Harvard led the field from the starting strokes and ended all other crews’ hopes of a comeback with a move in the third 500 meters. The varsity finished first, with Princeton taking second and Brown coming in a surprising third.
“The race went to plan,” said junior and varsity two seat Anthony Locke. “We always had a quick start, and the problem had been falling off the pace in the middle where Brown was strongest. So we always practiced the third quarter and going faster there. That’s what we did [at Sprints], and when it came to it, Brown didn’t have anything else it could give in the third quarter, nor did Princeton really.”
The Harvard freshman eight finished off a perfect season by winning gold at Sprints.
The highlight of the Crimson lightweight squad’s season was the varsity and freshman eights’ undefeated dual-racing record, capped off by each boat’s victory at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta. The varsity boat went a remarkable 10-0 before falling to Princeton at Eastern Sprints. This season marked the 27th undefeated dual-racing season for a varsity boat in the program’s history and was also the first time the Crimson had accomplished that since 1997. The first freshman eight also posted a perfect 10-0 dual-racing season before taking second place at Sprints to Cornell by less than half of a second.
For both the Harvard heavies and lights, the season was not quite perfect. But for the majority of performances thus far, the squads have outraced their opponents. The final tests will come in New London, Conn. at the Harvard-Yale regatta on Saturday and then in Camden, N.J. for the IRAs—the national championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Jennifer VanderMeulen first suited up in her Crimson lacrosse uniform this February, the freshman held modest expectations—primarily to help out on her team’s attack.
But expectations changed rather quickly for the 5’8” attacker when junior Jess Halpern, the reigning Ivy League scoring champion, suffered a season-ending injury in the second game of the season.
Just two hours into her collegiate career, the highly-touted recruit was now the one to shoulder Harvard’s offensive burden.
Before the Crimson’s third contest against then-No. 15 New Hampshire, Halpern took the rookie aside and told her she needed to step up.
“I kind of took that to heart,” VanderMeulen said. “She told me to take control, and that’s what I had to do.”
The rookie did not disappoint. The attacker scored five of her team’s 10 goals in its double-overtime upset of the Wildcats.
But VanderMeulen did not slow down from there. When all was said and done, the freshman finished the season with 56 goals, good for first in the Ivy League and fourth in the nation in scores per game.
After her rookie campaign, VanderMeulen was unanimously selected as the Ivy League Rookie of the Year and awarded a spot on the All-Ivy First Team.
“I kind of see it as a building step,” she said. “That sets the standard for me the next three years. I just want to try to keep getting better.”
For VanderMeulen’s opponents, the thought of her improving is a frightening one.
After the attacker netted 10 goals in her team’s first three contests, opposing defenses began to focus in on the New York native by face guarding or sending double-teams.
But these strategies could not keep VanderMeulen off the scoreboard, as she managed to score in each of her team’s 15 contests.
“She’s a player that other teams are watching,” said classmate Danielle Tetreault following the Crimson’s 11-9 upset over Princeton, in which VanderMeulen finished with three scores. “Because of that, they put their best defender on her, but Jenn always finds a way around that.”
“Those kinds of situations pump her up,” junior Sam McMahon said. “She just loves proving she can do it.”
In Ancient Eight play, VanderMeulen faced special attention from opposing defenses but still averaged 3.43 goals per contest.
She also managed to step up when it mattered most.
With her team needing a victory to keep its playoff hopes alive in the conference finale against Columbia, VanderMeulen finished with five scores to help guarantee a Harvard victory. The rookie’s first goal of that contest, her 47th of the season, gave her one more than Halpern’s Ivy League-leading total 46 from a season ago.
Luckily for the Crimson, next season the team should have both scorers healthy and on the field at the same time.
“That’s just going to be amazing,” VanderMeulen said. “I think our attack is going to be phenomenal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When junior Jess Halpern went down with a season-ending injury just two games into the regular season, it would have been easy for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team to pack it in the rest of the way.
Going into the 2010 season, Halpern, the reigning Ivy League scoring champion, was supposed to be the centerpiece of a  Crimson squad that was expected to contend for one of the Ancient Eight’s four playoff berths.
Things changed dramatically when Halpern tore her MCL and ACL less than 120 minutes into the 2010 campaign during a 15-10 loss to Johns Hopkins.
But rather than letting things go downhill from there, the youthful Harvard team (8-7, 3-4 Ivy) rallied and put together a successful season, finishing just one game short of making the inaugural Ancient Eight tournament.
“We didn’t stop, and we didn’t go backwards—it’s really going to help us launch into next season,” freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen said.
VanderMeulen, a heavily-recruited attacker, was one of the 10 first-year players who were forced to take on a larger role due to the team’s injuries.
“[The freshmen] came in here, and they knew what was expected of them,” junior Sam McMahon said. “They were not being timid—they were playing like they were seniors.”
VanderMeulen made the largest impact, taking on the role of the team’s top offensive weapon, as the freshman finished with a conference-high 56 goals to go along with 27 draw controls.
While VanderMeulen’s ability to finish shots helped her team on the scoreboard, it also helped inspire her classmates.
“To have Jenn out there taking it to goal early really helped,” said freshman Danielle Tetreault, who started at midfield for the Crimson from the first game. “It really showed us what we could do and what we needed to do.”
Sophomore Melanie Baskind, playing her first season of collegiate lacrosse, broke onto the scene in a big way as well, picking up a team-leading 41 ground balls while notching 32 goals. Baskind came on especially strong late in the season, as the midfielder scored five goals in Harvard’s final two contests, wins over Columbia and Boston College.
But while the Crimson finished the season on a tear—winning four of its last five contests by a total of 24 goals—the team struggled in earlier games.
After the squad managed to pull off an early win over then-No. 15 New Hampshire, Harvard dropped contests to weaker Ivy opponents Brown and Yale.
“We weren’t together for those games,” VanderMeulen said. “Those are the shoulda, woulda, coulda games we wish we could play again.”
But the Crimson had a turnaround moment when the team traveled south to take on then-No. 4 Virginia. Harvard hung with the top-five team for much of the contest, even leading late in the first half. A late Cavalier run helped Virginia close out the contest, 14-9, but the close match gave the Crimson confidence.
Harvard rebounded with wins over Holy Cross and Princeton, putting the Crimson in solid contention for the Ivy League tournament. When Harvard defeated Columbia in its final conference match of the season, it needed wins from Penn and Dartmouth to take the final playoff berth.
But while the Quakers took care of business, a Princeton upset over the Big Green doomed the Crimson and kept it on the outside of the conference tournament.
“It makes you want to make sure that next season we’re the ones playing in the game that matters,” Tetreault said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By many measures, the men’s golf team had the finest season in its history. Harvard’s scoring average of 294.07 shattered its previous best by more than seven strokes, and the Crimson finished better than sixth at every event. Yet for the 35th straight season, Harvard could not capture the Ivy League Championship on the final weekend, as it gave up a first-round lead and finished in fifth place.
“We left a little bit on the table as far as the Ivy League Championship is concerned,” sophomore Mark Pollak said. “But overall, this season was definitely a success.”
Despite the disappointing finish, the team’s core of Pollak, sophomore Tony Grillo, senior Greg Shuman, captain Danny Mayer, and junior Louis Amira carried the Crimson to a number of impressive finishes.
At the McLaughlin, the first tournament of the year, Shuman tied for the individual title by shooting two under par over 54 holes at the Bethpage Red Course, and Harvard claimed fifth place.
Shuman played in every tournament this year, a fitting finish for an individual who has played the most rounds in Crimson history with 80.5. Shuman also ends his tenure with the lowest career scoring average at 74.73 shots per round, or 3.96 strokes over par.
“Greg’s impact can’t be overstated—he’s truly led Harvard golf,” Pollak said. “He’s been our No. 1 player the last four years...He’s an awesome kid and an awesome player.”
Right behind Shuman in the record books is Mayer, who is third all-time in rounds played with 73.5 and fourth in scoring average at 76.57, or 5.84 strokes over par. Mayer also competed in every tournament this year, saving his best for last by finishing 23rd at the Ivy Championships at the Baltusrol Golf Club.
“Danny was wonderful. He was a great captain,” Grillo said. “I think he was a little disappointed that he wasn’t able to win an Ivy League championship during his four years.”
Along with experienced seniors, the team also featured a pair of up-and-comers. Coming off a strong freshman campaign, Pollak picked up where he left off, earning second-team All-Ivy honors and finishing second on the squad in scoring average. Pollak’s fourth-place finish at the Princeton Invitational helped Harvard tie for first place in the tournament—its best finish of the year—though it lost the tiebreaker to Yale.
“He goes after it,” Grillo said of his classmate. “It’s really fun to watch. He’s one of the most natural, fluid golfers I’ve ever met.”
The consistent play of Grillo provided the Crimson with another boon. The sophomore—the recipient of the 2010 Alex Vik ’78 MVP Award—led the team in scoring average with 73.28 strokes per round, or 3.00 shots over par. Grillo’s best individual finish in a tournament was sixth place at the Ivy Championships, which earned him second-team All-Ivy honors.
“[Grillo is] the hardest working, most focused player on our team,” Pollak said. “No one is going to work harder to improve their game in the offseason.”
Harvard had solid performances throughout the spring. Aside from the Princeton Invitational and Ivy Championships, the Crimson garnered a pair of third-place finishes at the Yale Invitational and the Caves Valley Invitational.
As the team moves forward it will lose not only Shuman and Mayer, but also seniors Peter Singh and Nick Moseley, who have been valuable contributors to the program over the course of their careers.
“Danny and Greg may have been the two [seniors] playing for our team, but Nick Moseley and Peter Singh were also really a big part of our team,” Grillo said. “They really helped us, even though their scores may have not been out there because they weren’t always traveling.”
Although it loses an accomplished senior class, a crop of talented recruits will allow the Crimson to compete for the Ivy title once again.
“We’re supposed to have some very strong recruits come in,” Pollak said. “They’re going to do a lot of good next year for us. And I think we’re going to be in just as good a position as we were in this year, maybe even better, going into next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seth Riddley ’08-’12 had never suffered from psychiatric problems before coming to college, but soon after moving from South Carolina to Cambridge to begin his freshman year, he faced family difficulties and began to seriously consider suicide.
Riddley approached his resident dean, who immediately referred him to Harvard University Health Services. UHS physicians sent Riddley to McLean Hospital—a psychiatric facility associated with Harvard Medical School—escorted in a cab by his resident dean.
The experience ushered Riddley into Harvard’s mental health system, which he has been intimately involved with throughout the six years since he first arrived on campus as a freshman. Since his initial crisis, Riddley has taken four years off—mainly due to mental health issues—and he continues to see therapists and prescribers at UHS.
“I don’t know how I would have made it without what I’ve encountered as tremendous quality mental health care here,” Riddley recalls.
Students and UHS administrators have endlessly debated the quality of Harvard’s mental health services, which treats about 15 percent of the students in the College—or roughly 1,000 undergraduates—in any given school year, according to Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul J. Barreira.
The wrongful death lawsuit filed against Harvard College and UHS last November focused campus attention on potential issues with UHS’s mental health policies. The family of John B. Edwards III ’10, who committed suicide in Nov. 2007, alleges that the negligent psychiatric care that Edwards received at UHS contributed to his death.
While several students say that UHS services have improved in recent years, particularly praising the accessibility of appointments, others say they have encountered frustrating limits on the amount of therapy they can receive or have had negative experiences with therapists during some of their most vulnerable moments.
LIMITATIONS ON CARE
One of the primary concerns among students who have frequented UHS mental health services over an extended period of time is the perceived restriction on the number of visits they are permitted.
Harvard undergraduate Joseph, whose name has been changed to protect his privacy, began receiving therapy at UHS during his freshman year, and says his therapist told him that he was limited to only receiving therapy once every two weeks.
“No matter how good the therapist is, every two weeks isn’t necessarily the right amount,” Joseph says.
Rachel, a freshman whose name has also been changed, says she was similarly limited to one therapy session every two weeks—inadequate for her needs. Though she liked her therapist, she says she stopped receiving care at UHS because of the limited amount of help the system could provide.
“I was just very upset that I didn’t get as much out of it as I had expected or hoped to,” Rachel says. “I do feel stuck and lost, and I need help and it’s there—but it’s not enough.”
Rachel says her therapist directly referenced a 12-session limit at which Rachel’s therapy would have to be re-evaluated, although her therapist was confident that she would qualify for treatment beyond that constraint.
Several students interviewed for this piece say that they have been limited in the amount of in-house therapy that UHS was willing to provide. While some say that they were restricted to an every-other-week therapy regimen, others say that they had been cognizant of some form of an unofficial limit on sessions.
But according to UHS officials, there is no official restriction on the number of therapy sessions that students can receive.
“The notion that you can only be seen 12 times is just false,” Barreira says. He adds that the only restrictions on therapy apply when students seek care from therapists outside of UHS; in these cases, the student health insurance plan will only cover 12 sessions.
“There’s a review, but the review just has to do with getting our colleagues to look at what we’re doing with the treatment and what we should be doing differently,” Barreira says.
Chief of Mental Health Richard D. Kadison concedes that during the busiest months, some students must receive slightly less care to accommodate appointments for students with acute distress.
“Sometimes people who have been seen more, their visits will be spread out a little bit more due to supply and demand and trying to accommodate students,” Kadison says.
A SENSE OF RUSH
Some students say that they faced disquieting experiences at key moments in their care, including a sense that they were either rushed through intake appointments or faced with excessive wait times at after-hours urgent care.
Ellie, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, sought care this past fall when she began to feel anxious and depressed. While she was given an intake appointment within a week, she was shocked when her therapist told her she was bipolar after a 20-minute conversation.
“I was surprised that she could come to the conclusion so quickly,” Ellie says.
One freshman student, who does not wish to be named, says that when he accompanied a friend to Mental Health Services during finals period in the fall, he was disconcerted by how long it took for a therapist to arrive.
“The fact that it took an hour and a half to see someone is alarming,” the individual says.
A student involved with mental health advocacy at Harvard, who also does not wish to be identified, says that some of these issues were widely acknowledged as weaknesses in the Harvard mental health system.
“I personally have gotten a lot of complaints from students that the counselors themselves rush people through appointments. [And] there are some pretty terrible stories of people going in after hours, and the on-call psychologist coming in 45 minutes late,” the student said.
Another potential source of difficulty is the division of mental health care between therapists, who provide counseling, and prescribers—nurse practitioners or psychiatrists—who dispense medication to students.
While some students say they appreciate having two different people to turn to, others say this system creates a disconnect between the different aspects of their treatment.
QUALITY CARE, ROBUST RESOURCES
Although many students with long-term issues express discontent with UHS’ treatment system, students who have received short-term mental health treatment from UHS shower praise upon the system, particularly the accessibility of appointments and the relatively short wait times.
Barreira says that the availability of care is partly a function of the robustness of UHS staff, which he says is one of the largest on a per-student basis for any university in the country.
New patients receive a 20-minute appointment to speak with a clinician by phone within two days of their initial request, and they are then set up with a follow-up appointment to see a UHS therapist in person.
“I think the mental health side of UHS is a lot more helpful than the physical health side,” says Emma, another student who has used UHS’ mental health services and whose name has been changed to maintain her privacy. “There was a lot of flexibility in times, and they were really good about contacting me about appointments and setting things up.”
Undergraduates who received less than 10 therapy sessions at UHS say they never felt as though their therapy was being restricted, and they were not informed of any limit on the amount of treatment they could receive.
Students who approach UHS for a specific issue also praise the system, like Caitlin E. Carey ’13, who receives treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
“I haven’t really had any negatives with UHS mental health services,” Carey says.
Barreira says that UHS continues to increase and restructure its staff to reduce wait times and increase the availability of therapy.
“Mental Health Services is always evolving,” Barreira says. “It is never the same today as it was a month or even a year ago.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not very often that Radcliffe heavyweight crew (4-7) enters the championship season as an unranked team with more losses than wins.
But for the rowers of the Black and White, rather than succumb to the frustration of earlier regatta disappointments, they chose to use them as motivation in preparation for the EAWRC sprints held on May 16.
“Because it’s been such a hard season, we’re just really excited to come out and make the most of our time at [Sprints],” co-captain Laura Huppert said before the race. “I’ve been really impressed with the dedication and commitment to be able to come back from races where we didn’t do as well as we hoped, and come out the next day in practice and continue to go after it and work hard to get faster.”
The result? Redemption at Sprints, as the varsity eight claimed the fastest time in the petite finals with a time of 6:43.35.
Radcliffe started off the dual season with strong results at the San Diego Crew Classic, as both the varsity eight and second varsity eight crews reached the finals to place fifth and sixth, respectively.
Faced with a daunting conference schedule that pitted the Black and White against each of the top seven seeds in the EAWRC, Radcliffe posted losses to Brown, Cornell, Princeton, and Dartmouth.
“I had hoped we had made progress in the past week [at practice], but obviously the results didn’t show that,” said Black and White coach Liz O’Leary after her varsity eight finished nearly 27 seconds behind Princeton on Apr. 10.
After a non-conference win against Syracuse, the struggles continued for Radcliffe, as the crews headed out to New Haven only to be swept by Yale in all five races.
But the losing streak would end there, as Radcliffe posted strong showings in all six races of the Beanpot regatta earlier this month to claim the team championship for the second straight year.
“[The Beanpot] was our last opportunity to put out a really good race before Sprints,” Huppert said. “Everybody knew going into the race that this was our shot of really turning things around.”
The fourth-ranked lightweight crew (4-3) also began its dual season with high expectations, but unlike its heavyweight counterpart, the Black and White found considerable success on the waters of the Charles.
After a season-opening win against Buffalo, Radcliffe hosted Georgetown in the Class of 1974 Cup. With an established rhythm on the water, the varsity eight came from behind to seize its first trophy of the season with a time of 7:24.5.
“We worked really hard all winter, and it was nice to come into the spring season and see that work pay off,” said junior 1V rower Lizzy Bates after the regatta.
But the Black and White would suffer its first loss of the season against then-No. 2 Stanford. Faced with strong tailwinds and frigid weather, Radcliffe fell to the Cardinal by nearly 12 seconds in the varsity eight race. And though the Black and White took home the loss, the 2V boat’s strong performance—the crew finished 7.5 seconds ahead of Stanford in its race—reflected the team’s improvement over the course of the season.
Radcliffe resumed its conference schedule the following week against Princeton and Bucknell. In a race that saw multiple lead changes on the waters of Lake Carnegie, the Black and White started off the race with the early lead, but the Tigers eventually came back to finish first with a time of 7:14.6. Radcliffe wasn’t far behind, posting a strong second-place finish at 7:16.9.
The Black and White closed the regular season earlier this month against MIT and No. 1 Wisconsin. Radcliffe’s runner-up finish and time of 6:58.8 was enough to beat MIT to claim the Muri Cup for the second straight year.
With momentum from the victory over the Engineers, the Black and White entered Eastern Sprints on May 16 with confidence that it could achieve its season goals.
“One of the goals we had set in September was to have every boat medal at the Eastern Sprints, and we accomplished that,” co-captain Amanda Pfabe said.
The varsity eight took third place with a time of 6:46.6, falling only to Wisconsin and Princeton. The second varsity, varsity four, and novice eight all took second place in their respective races.
“We really showed our depth, so we’re really happy about that,” Pfabe said after the race. “Throughout the season, we really learned about pushing ourselves, and I think that showed today.”
The lightweights will wrap up their season at the IRA National Championships June 3-5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You can usually expect it to take some time for a team full of young talent to get its footing, but in the case of Harvard women’s water polo, it took almost no time at all to prove its prowess in the pool.
The Crimson, despite dominating opponents at the top of its schedule, posted a 12-15 overall record and went 1-3 in division play.
“Ultimately, we didn’t finish as strongly as we hoped,” sophomore goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy said. “But we definitely accomplished some of the things we set out for at the beginning of the year.”
Opening the season at home at the Harvard Invitational, the Crimson went undefeated in the weekend’s four games. The biggest victory came first with a 16-2 decision over Villanova.
In the game, sophomore, rising co-captain, and team scoring leader Devan Kennifer recorded her first hat trick of the year, while nine more teammates tallied scores of their own.
Kennifer, who was named to the All-Northern Division First Team, followed up her impressive freshman year with an equally noteworthy performance early in her second season, scoring no less than three goals in the first five games.
Harvard went on to continue the winning trend as it traveled to New Jersey for the Princeton Invitational, where it racked up victories in another three of four games.
As the team’s veterans stepped up to contribute, so too did some of the Crimson’s newest additions.
Freshmen Elise Molnar and Aisha Price emerged as powerful players on Harvard’s offense.
“We’re a very young team, which makes us really optimistic about the future,” McCarthy said.
After nearly reaching double-digit scoring at the Harvard Invitational, Molnar was named the CWPA Northern Division Rookie of the Week.
Price, the Crimson’s Rookie of the Year and a member of the varsity soccer team, recorded some big goals, along with sophomore teammate Ita Barton-Kettleborough, as the team moved on to the ECAC Championships and the Elite Eight tournament—but the team began to falter.
Although Harvard beat Bucknell in a close overtime match at the Elite Eight just a week after the Bison had beaten them for fifth place at the ECAC Championships, it dropped to a 9-5 record.
As the Crimson headed across the country for spring break, it was challenged on defense as it went up against ranked opponents, including Cal State East Bay and Pacific.
McCarthy was kept busy in goal during the West Coast road trip and earned CWPA Northern Division Defensive Player of the Week honors as Harvard picked up three more wins and losses.
The Crimson returned to the Northeast and began conference play against 11th-ranked Hartwick, dropping the game, 15-8.
In one of the most exciting matchups of the season, Harvard took on rival Brown at home in Blodgett Pool and battled to a 7-6 overtime victory.
McCarthy kept the Bears’ powerful offense in check, giving the Crimson a chance to clinch the win.
“We got a great game out of our goalie,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said after the win. “McCarthy played her best game of the year.”
Sophomore Monica Zdrojewski, an All-Northern Division first-team honoree, capitalized for the Crimson and scored the winning tally with just over a minute left in the extra period.
“I think that it was one of our best games,” Molnar said. “Technically...everything was really perfect.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, it couldn’t keep the momentum going and went on to lose its next five games.
With a group of young athletes and a new coach following Farrar’s resignation in May, the Crimson’s future may appear a bit uncertain, but returning players are confident the team will triumph and improve on this season’s disappointments.
“It’ll be interesting because we’re getting a big recruiting class, but for the first time in a long time we’ll have more upperclassmen than underclassmen,” McCarthy said. “We’ll see how it goes, but we know we’ll stick together no matter what.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rowing legend Jim Dietz once said, “In rowing, as in life, there are competitors and there are racers. The competitor works hard and rows to his limit. The racer does not think of limits, only the race.”
If there’s one thing that the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight squads both could not get out of their minds this season, it was the thought of races past and races yet to come. Each came off of last year’s performances at the regional Sprints championships and the IRA national championships with a bitter aftertaste lingering in their mouths.
Neither was able to upset their regional rivals nor claim victory on the national stage. This season was therefore about breaking the surface and coming out on top.
“This year’s Sprints did feel like unfinished business,” said sophomore and varsity three seat Mike DiSanto. “Because we had really fallen short last year at Sprints, as had the entire program, we really wanted to come back strong and get what was ours. And that was on the agenda through this season and into Sprints.”
After earning a road win at Cornell to open the season, the Harvard heavyweights traveled to Providence, R.I., where they faced Brown, the team that had upset them last year at Sprints. The racing was tight in all events, but the Crimson freshman eight was the only boat to secure a win.
“Although we were disappointed to lose to Brown at the beginning of the year, it really gave us a good wake-up call and got us training really hard to have the specific goal of beating them, running all the way up to Sprints,” said junior and varsity two seat Anthony Locke. “That was the biggest difference from last year—being really focused on beating them all the time.”
If the Bears were the fuel for Harvard’s fire, then MIT, Princeton, Navy, Penn, and Northeastern were all casualties of that early-season loss as well.
A snapped steering cable in the Princeton varsity boat that forced it to steer into Harvard marked the race against MIT and the Tigers on the Charles on Apr. 17. Princeton lost its bow in the collision and did not finish the race.
The Midshipmen, Quakers, and Huskies also found themselves in the Crimson’s wake.
Harvard’s win against Penn marked Crimson coach Harry Parker’s 50th Adams Cup regatta, and Harvard acquired the unofficial title of “fastest crew on the Charles” when it defeated crosstown rival Northeastern.
Most recently, the Crimson heavyweights walked away team champions at the Eastern Sprints Regatta, having won both the varsity eight as well as the freshman eight events.
The team still has the historic Harvard-Yale Regatta, the IRA national championships, and a trip for the varsity and freshman eights to the Henley Royal Regatta in England ahead on its slate.
The Harvard lightweight squad came off of last season gunning for the Princeton Tigers, who had upset the Crimson in the final three races of the season. Improving on Harvard’s performance from Sprints last year, where it had won the Jope Cup as team champions, would mean winning gold in all events this year.
“The team dynamics both within the first varsity boat and across the team as a whole have just been very, very good this year,” said junior and varsity two seat Jared Dourdeville. “And those team dynamics and that motivation have just been a great force throughout all of the team.”
From the season-opening sweep against the University of Delaware, the entire lightweight squad has been striving for perfect race performances. The varsity and freshman eight beat every opponent they faced this dual-racing season, including Cornell, Penn, Georgetown, St. Joseph’s, Dartmouth, Navy, and MIT.
Their 10-0 runs culminated in wins over the Tigers and the Yale Bulldogs at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta.
Despite the dual-racing success, though, Sprints seemed like a recurring bad dream for the lightweights. The first varsity eight and freshman eight took second place, while the second varsity eight did not medal and the third varsity finished with bronze. Overall, the squad came in second to Princeton in total points.
“We were in a privileged situation where every boat except the 2V got a medal at Sprints,” said captain and varsity five seat Martin Eiermann. “So it’s a little bit tough to complain because of all the medals. But it’s very clear that it was not what we had in mind when we showed up in Worcester. And looking back at the season and how guys had performed in practice and responded to challenges that we had been facing, we had high expectations, and there’s no reason to hide that.”
While the freshmen will have to wait until next year to avenge their loss at Sprints, the varsity eight has only one more week to prepare to upset the rankings and beat Princeton at IRAs on June 4-5.
“We’re going to be doing lots of training and trying to extend ourselves in the next few weeks,” Eiermann said. “So far the response has been great. There has been lots of positive energy. No one is resigning in the face of what happened on [May 16], and I am very reassured by that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an outstanding co-captain in Jay Connolly ’09 protecting the Harvard net, it was strange to have such another high-caliber goalie on the bench.
Nikhil Balaraman had the talent of a starter all along, but instead, he was backup to Connolly his junior year.
“It was sort of funny to have them both playing on the same team,” said Crimson co-captain Egen Atkinson. “To have Nikhil be a backup goalie as a junior was strange, because we knew he was an outstanding goalie, but Jay was just a little more experienced.”
Balaraman had been highly touted in high school, especially after being a part of four straight California Interscholastic Federation championship teams.
Once he came to Harvard, he showed early promise—making 52 saves his freshman year—and was named to the Association of College Water Polo Coaches 2006 Men’s All-American Academic Team.
In his sophomore year, Balaraman didn’t see any action after taking a necessary break from the sport due to personal reasons.
Balaraman’s absence ended when he came back last year, playing only in a handful of games but still showing some of the skill that brought him to the Crimson program.
He was especially influential in an ECAC Championship game against Iona where he made 10 saves, but could not prevent the team from falling, 12-10.     Harvard ended the 2008 season with a dismal 5-12 record, faring only a little better against conference opponents (3-4).
Despite demonstrating he could still play, Balaraman was not going to overtake Connolly’s starting job.
The highly decorated senior had backed up his captaincy with an impressive 113 saves by the end of the Crimson’s season and was named to the All-Northern Division team twice in his career.
Those were quite some shoes to fill, but Balaraman was far from daunted.
Instead, Balaraman stepped up in the 2009 season and recorded 116 saves in 13 games, including an inspired 13-save performance against then-No. 11 Princeton at the Princeton Invitation in September and several 11-save games throughout the season.
“Nikhil went from being a backup to a senior starter and leader of the team,” junior co-captain Bret Voith said. “He took it very seriously, and you could see it in practice everyday and before games, during games, after games.”
Harvard improved to 3-3 in conference play and 7-17 overall.
Much of the team’s success was due to Balaraman’s first-rate play keeping a shaky Crimson defense in the game, like Connolly did the year before.
“Nikhil was especially valuable because he played up to big situations,” Atkinson said. “He was the better player in the biggest games and he had huge saves—like seemingly impossible saves. He was not only clutch, but he was also an inspiration at times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard water polo is like the elevator business—it has its ups and downs.
So in a season marked by a number of close losses, the men’s team still showed flashes of potential, finishing near the middle of the Northern Division pack at 7-17 overall with a 3-3 conference record.
In particular, after relying heavily on its star co-captains David Tune ’09 and Jay Connolly ’09 last season, the Crimson emerged as a more balanced squad this time around, getting offensive contributions from 14 different players—nine of whom reached double digits in scoring.
“I think [the offense] evolved over the course of the season,” junior co-captain Bret Voith said. “A lot of the scoring was distributed pretty evenly…and I think that helped with individual player development, but at the same time, our offense never really developed an identity.”
Indeed, with the offense relying on the cohesion of the entire team, it is not surprising that the squad took awhile to click. Harvard dropped six of its first seven contests at the MIT and Princeton Invitationals.
Soon enough, though, this offensive unit began to gel, and fueled by solid goaltending, the Crimson turned things around. Harvard reeled off three wins in the next five contests—including league wins over MIT and Queens (N.Y.)—thanks in large part to the work of senior Nikhil Balaraman and sophomore Alexandre Popp between the pipes.
“[Balaraman] had a great season,” co-captain Egen Atkinson said. “He won the coaches’ award at the team banquet, which is given to the guy who puts the team before his own needs. I think that encapsulates Nikhil’s mentality. He was always concerned about the team and not his own glory or playing time.”
Indeed, with a relatively even split between the two goalies, neither enjoyed the recognition that Connolly did as one of the league’s best keepers. Balaraman proved to be more than capable as a keeper, averaging nearly nine saves per game in his 13 starts. Popp was not far behind with 90 stops in just 11 contests.
Bolstered by dependable play in net, Harvard knew it had the pieces in place to be successful. Voith and fellow juniors Alex Thompson and Jeff Lee emerged as talented scorers, racking up 28, 29, and 21 tallies, respectively. But after another dominant victory over Connecticut College, the Crimson’s season took a nosedive. Four straight losses at home left the team vulnerable heading into the Northern Division Championships, and Harvard dropped its opening match to MIT, 7-5, effectively ending the season without a bid to the Eastern Championships.
“We were a little disappointed with the season,” Atkinson said. “We had a couple fun wins, including one over MIT early in the season, but we didn’t put it together to make it to Easterns.”
Despite missing out on the postseason, Harvard closed the Northern Tournament with two wins, reminding its opponents that it remains competitive in the division.
Although Atkinson and Balaraman’s departures leave holes to be filled, with Popp in net and the trio of junior scorers—aided by rookie standout Max Eliot—headlining the squad’s 12 returning athletes, Harvard has reason for optimism in 2010.
And even more importantly, perhaps, is the Crimson’s influx of new talent, with a class of six incoming freshmen to supplement last year’s haul of just two rookies. Atkinson attributed this increase directly to the coaching staff.
“We had an amazing addition to the team in Shana Welch, the assistant coach,” Atkinson said. “She’s going to do huge things in terms of recruiting.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, Welch will represent one of the few constants among the coaches.
After six years at the head of the men’s and women’s teams, coach Erik Farrar resigned in mid-May, leaving the team in flux.
Still, with Voith returning as co-captain, joined by sophomore Luka Babic, the Crimson knows it is in good hands.
“I’m excited to see what Bret and Luka can do as co-captains,” Atkinson said. “I’d like to think Bret and I set some precedents...and I hope that Luka and Bret will be able to build on the things that worked.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the most part, Ivy League basketball is a horizontal game—earthbound players embracing the fundamentals (the layup, the bank-shot, the bounce pass). The occasional dunk always excites the crowd because Ancient Eight basketball rarely occupies a vertical dimension.
For this reason, freshman forward Kyle Casey is a spectacle. The Medway, Mass. native is introducing flight to Ivy gymnasiums.
Take Harvard’s game at Dartmouth, for example. With the Crimson up two points midway through the second half, Casey caught the Big Green defense sleeping and cut backdoor. Sophomore guard Oliver McNally lofted a pass up to the rim that Casey snagged and flushed for an alley-oop.
Or take Harvard’s first game against Princeton. After a missed jump shot by co-captain Jeremy Lin, Casey crashed the boards from the top of the key. He leapt in the air and slammed home the put-back dunk over Tigers guard Dan Mavraides.
Countless other moments—other ferocious dunks and soaring blocked shots—capture Casey’s athleticism. Like a king in checkers, he moves in ways other players simply cannot.
“Kyle is a freak athlete,” Lin said before the season. “The things he does, no one else on this team can do.”
The 6’7” freshman had to step in and help Harvard in a big way this season. Injuries to sophomore Keith Wright, senior Pat Magnarelli, and sophomore Andrew Van Nest left a gaping hole in the frontcourt during the conference slate—a space capably filled by Casey.
On the year, Casey averaged 10.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game, both tops in the league amongst freshmen.
He won Ivy League Rookie of the Week four times, and Ivy League Player of the Week once, following a 20-point performance at Yale and a 27-point outburst at Brown.
At the end of the season, he was honored as the Ivy League Rookie of the Year—the sixth in Harvard history and the first since 1998—and an honorable mention for All-Ivy.
“[The freshmen] really did contribute in a great way—starting with Kyle being Rookie of the Year in our conference—but it didn’t start that way for him,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “As all freshmen, they get knocked back a little bit by how challenging and physical and different and hard [college basketball] is.”
After opening the schedule with 12 points at Holy Cross, Casey did not crack double figures in scoring for the next 10 games.
His early struggles were the growing pains of a positional change. Whereas in high school Casey could back down smaller opponents and beat larger ones off the dribble, Amaker envisioned the freshman as more of a traditional post player.
“I was not used to playing down low that much,” Casey said. “That was a big adjustment for me. A lot of the guys outweighed me, but Coach [Amaker] worked with me all year on using my quickness and my speed to play defense and offense.”
His hard work paid big dividends. On Harvard’s West Coast trip, the freshman dropped 19 points on Seattle and 27 on Santa Clara. Soon thereafter, when the injury bug bit the Crimson big men, Casey began playing 35 minutes a night, as he and co-captain Doug Miller were the only healthy forwards. During this stretch in the month of February, Casey averaged 13.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game.
“Coach [Amaker] always says, ‘Stay ready, so you don’t have to get ready,’” Casey said. “So I just stepped in and did what I was supposed to do.”
“The reason why he had success was, well, one, he’s extremely talented and developed in skills, especially for a freshman,” Lin said. “More importantly, he’s very humble and a hard worker, and that goes a long way. Everyone could see him develop and grow as a player.”
By season’s end, Casey had become not only the best freshman in the Ivy League, but one of the conference’s top players.
Athletic and industrious, it appears that the sky’s the limit for this rookie.
“He’s going to be the face of the program next year, and he’s going to break a lot of records,” Lin predicted. “Harvard’s really lucky to have a player like him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2009-10 season put Harvard men’s basketball on the map. Guided by a bona fide college hoops star, some precocious freshmen, and a coach of blue-blooded pedigree, the Crimson enjoyed the finest season in its history—a basketball genesis that was met with national (and oftentimes international) media exposure. Ultimately, Harvard (21-8, 10-4 Ivy) once again fell short of an Ivy League title, but in the process it established a new benchmark for Crimson basketball.
“Our kids are proud of the body of work that has been put in for this season,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was very proud of this group—the way this team played together, the style, the identity of this group. They embodied what we want to see in a Harvard basketball team.”
The Crimson opened the season with a pair of nonconference wins over Holy Cross and William and Mary, the second coming on a triple-overtime buzzer-beater from co-captain Jeremy Lin that found its way onto ESPN’s SportsCenter.
From that point forward, the Crimson cruised through the rest of its non-conference schedule, picking up wins over the likes of Boston College, George Washington, and Rice. Harvard’s only hiccups were a 16-point drubbing at Georgetown, a three-point defeat at Army, and a narrow six-point loss at UConn.
Against the Huskies, Lin raised eyebrows with an impressive stat line of 30 points, nine rebounds, three assists, and three steals.
After the nonconference slate ended, attention turned to the race for the Ivy League title. With perhaps the strongest field in its history, the Ancient Eight had three contenders—all of which won at least 21 games—in Cornell, Princeton, and Harvard. The Crimson cruised in most of its 10 conference wins, with an 82-79 overtime thriller at Yale and a 67-66 comeback at Penn as the only tight contests.
But against its top challengers—the Big Red and the Tigers—Harvard was not so lucky.
Princeton eked out a pair of three-point victories both in Cambridge and at home, in which last-second three-point attempts fell short for the Crimson.
“I definitely wish we could have picked up those two wins against Princeton,” said freshman forward Kyle Casey of what he considered the season’s biggest disappointment. “We dropped the ball there.”
The two contests against Cornell were also disappointing. In the first game in Ithaca, the highly-anticipated matchup turned into a 36-point blowout as the Big Red simply dominated Harvard.
The Crimson sought revenge on its home court a few weeks later, but once again Cornell prevailed, 79-70, after shooting better than 50 percent from beyond the arc.
Although Harvard was not able to hang a championship banner in Lavietes Pavilion, it managed to play in its first postseason tournament since 1946, winning a bid to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament.
In its first-round matchup against Appalachian State, the Crimson came out on fire, building up a 12-point lead. But the team soon fell flat, and the Mountaineers coasted to a 93-71 victory, ending Harvard’s historic season on a sour note.
When all was said and done, the Crimson improved on the previous year’s record of 14-14 (6-8 Ivy) and set a program best for wins in a season.
“All in all, I thought the season went really well,” Casey said. “A lot of highs, a few lows, but I thought we did a good job.”
Harvard’s quick turnaround was due in part to the healthy return of its big men.
The other boon for the Crimson was its freshmen. The core four of Casey, Brandyn Curry, Christian Webster, and Dee Giger vaulted the squad to the top tier of the Ivy League.
“They had to earn everything, and they did,” Amaker said of his freshmen. “We’re very high on those guys—all of them. Very pleased with what they were able to bring to our program on a first-year basis.”
Though Harvard came up short of its ultimate goal, the Crimson felt it left nothing in its tank.
“No regrets—I think that’s the one thing that I don’t have,” Lin said. “Throughout the entire process, I made sure, and the guys that I played with made sure, that no matter what happened, we would put our best effort forth. I can honestly say that we gave everything that we could and we tried our best.”
Lin’s graduation marks the end of an era, but with the league wide open next season, the Crimson has the pieces in place to make another run at its first-ever Ivy League championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In only the squad’s second game of the season, it became quite clear that Harvard men’s basketball was going to be something special.
The sign came in the form of a buzzer-beating miracle—a heave let fly 25 feet away from the basket, off the fingertips of the savior of Crimson hoops: co-captain Jeremy Lin.
A crowd of 1,297, packed into Lavietes Pavilion Nov. 15 for Harvard’s home opener, played witness to a triple-overtime dogfight against William & Mary, a game that ended on one of the most memorable shots ever taken in the building.
With under 10 seconds to play in the third overtime period, the Tribe’s Sean McCurdy snaked his way down the right side of the lane and knocked in a right-handed layup, giving his team an 85-84 advantage over its hosts.
With 3.6 seconds on the clock, Lin, who had been hovering on the far side of the court, took the inbounds pass at his own three-point line.
Sprinting down the right side of the court, he dribbled once, then again. Lin was bumped hard on the left hip by a leaping William & Mary player at midcourt, but the referees swallowed their whistles—and so the guard continued on with one more dribble.
Then came the hard part.
Lin gathered the ball up to let loose a shot—presumably seeking a foul. There were certainly grounds for a call: a member of the Tribe nudged Lin’s left shoulder as he went up to shoot, forcing him sprawling to the ground.
But the only thing the closest official needed to do was signal a made basket, as Lin’s push-off-his-right-shoulder-while-falling-backwards prayer was answered.
Cue bedlam.
His ears buzzing with the revelry he had just incited, Lin sprang up from the court and dashed backwards towards the hoop he had been under less than five seconds ago.
His teammates not far behind, Lin ran until he couldn’t go any farther—so he leapt and took a few steps up the white cinder-block wall bordering the court.
Lin’s choice of celebration was rather fitting. For a split second, he had again accomplished the impossible. Against the Crimson playmaker, nothing stood a chance—not even gravity.
The long-distance shot, which gave Harvard the 87-85 win—its second victory in as many games—landed the veteran on highlight reels all over the nation and negated a big comeback for William & Mary.
The Tribe had trailed by as many as 13 points in the second half before rallying to force overtime.
Lin, who had a team-high 19 points and nine assists, had plenty of help in regulation and overtime. Sophomore guard Oliver McNally had 17 points, and most importantly, the Crimson frontcourt came up big.
“[Senior] Pat [Magnarelli] and [sophomore] Keith [Wright], those two guys in particular, were the difference for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said at the time.
Wright and Magnarelli combined for 24 points and 14 rebounds, making several key plays down the stretch.
The grueling win gained even more significance as the season continued for both squads.
“That was a big game for us,” Lin said. “Just the way we won it, it built a lot of team chemistry and a lot of confidence in our team, and I think that helped us in terms of pulling out close games...It was just a big thing for our team that early on.”
The Crimson would build on that momentum over the next two months, setting a school record in non-conference wins with 11, and William & Mary would have a noteworthy season of its own.
The Tribe was the CAA tournament runner-up and won 10 road games—including victories at Maryland and Wake Forest—to put together a résumé impressive enough to gain it a berth in the NIT, where it fell in the first round to eventual runner-up North Carolina, 80-72.
But for one day in November, William & Mary was in the news for the wrong reason.
It could not come up with a stop when it needed it the most, setting up a most memorable ending that began a historic season for Harvard basketball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The task: replace your top three scorers, including a two-time Olympic gold medalist, and put a freshman in net in the middle of the ECAC playoff race because your starter, the NCAA record holder for career save percentage, just suffered a season-ending injury. And still get home ice advantage in the NCAA tournament.
Business as usual for women’s hockey coach Katey Stone.
“I think as a staff, this was probably our best year together,” Stone said. “It was just a good vibe around our program. Everyone was fired up to practice. They weren’t stubborn, they were eager. I wouldn’t say we did anything differently—just a real good group of kids.”
That group could have used a plethora of excuses, and many of the team’s playmakers had limited experience. Yet Stone’s charges played as if they expected to win every game.
“She sets the expectations high and always believes in you, only because she knows you can do it,” freshman Jillian Dempsey said. “She’s going to make us the best we can be.”
And while some teams started strong and faded, the Crimson kept getting better, peaking with a six-game win streak through early February. In that stretch, it rocked Dartmouth, 4-1, after needing a last-minute, game-winning goal the first time around and took the Beanpot by storm, not allowing a single goal in either game on its way to the tournament title.
Harvard showed all the usual hallmarks of good coaching: it killed penalties well—allowing only 14 goals in 323 penalty minutes—and wore teams down with superior speed and conditioning. That conditioning and discipline allowed the Crimson to take two easy victories from Princeton in the ECAC playoffs, despite not having beaten the Tigers during the regular season.
And behind each impressive victory was a coach who was still not satisfied.
“Her personality is a big part of our season,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “She keeps us focused.”
The first playoff win against Princeton also marked a significant personal milestone for Stone.
With the victory, the 338th of her career, she passed Laura Halldorson to reach the top of the NCAA career coaching wins list.
But even that honor hasn’t softened Stone. If anything, it seems to have made her more driven to succeed.
“To be really honest, it’s really over,” Stone said of her record. “If we don’t keep rolling, someone’s going to catch up and break that record.”
But as long as Stone stays behind the Harvard bench, that record shouldn’t be falling anytime soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her first two seasons on the Harvard women’s hockey team, junior Liza Ryabkina had shown flashes of brilliance.
Her powerful shot, skill with the puck, and ability to play at both ends of the ice offered fans a taste of what the skater could do once she got her moment in the spotlight.
With the graduation of Olympian Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 last May, it looked like Ryabkina was about to get her chance to shine.
But as the season opened, Ryabkina found herself on the bench with a dislocated knee suffered at a captains’ practice in September.
“We really didn’t know what to expect,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said of the injury. “That’s a precarious injury. She was in tremendous shape, and that happened.”
The junior missed the first nine games of Harvard’s season. But when she returned in the squad’s Nov. 25 matchup with Dartmouth, Ryabkina reminded the Crimson just how much it had missed her.
With 3:29 to play in the contest, Ryabkina tipped in a shot off the stick of rookie Josephine Pucci, giving Harvard a 3-2 win over its conference rival.
“When everyone jumped on me after I scored that goal, I don’t think I’ve ever been happier in my life,” the junior said in November.
She replicated her heroics the following weekend, scoring the lone goal in the Crimson’s 1-0 upset of then-No. 2 Minnesota. And from there, the goals just kept on coming.
“She was really chomping at the bit to get back,” junior Kate Buesser said. “The injury just put things into perspective and allowed her to give everything she had when she could play—and it was definitely reflected in the last half of the season.”
Despite missing the first month of the season, Ryabkina finished third on the team in points (22) and was second only to Buesser in goals with 15. She was also nominated for the Patty Kazmaier Award, given annually to the best player in college women’s hockey.
“I look at Liza, and she’s one of the most dominant players at the collegiate level for women,” Buesser said. “That’s a really great thing to have on your line.”
Ryabkina’s best performance came in the Beanpot, where she lit up Boston College in the first game with a career-high four-goal performance, including a natural hat trick in the third period.
She then scored the game-winner in the championship matchup with Northeastern, giving Harvard all the offense it would need in its 1-0 victory and earning tournament MVP honors in the process.
“It was her best season,” Stone said. “I really believe she has the capability of being one of the top five best players in the country. It’s all in her head and all in her hands, as far as I’m concerned.”

The Harvard men’s squash team (7-5) ended the 2009-10 season by maintaining its rank at fifth in the nation during the CSA National Team Championships.
The team’s performance and consistent effort throughout the campaign were punctuated by co-captain Colin West’s victory over Princeton freshman Todd Harrity to claim the national individual title a week later.
“I wouldn’t say that we had a real shining year,” West said. “There were some matches that we could have won, like [those against] Yale and Princeton. They were probably stronger than us on paper, but we didn’t quite come through.”
At the national team tournament, the Crimson fell to fourth-seeded Princeton, 8-1, with West picking up the lone victory for Harvard.
The squad was able to come back from the tough loss to defeat Western Ontario and Cornell handily, both by a score of 7-2. These final two victories secured a fifth-place finish for the Crimson at the championships.
Trinity took home the team title for the 12th year in a row, though Harvard still leads in all-time national championships. The Crimson has won a total of 31 championships, with the last coming in 1998.
“From our competitors’ standpoint,” West said, “there were a lot of thoughts that Harvard would not have a very strong team this year.”
The Crimson denied these expectations with several impressive individual performances.
West, who led the team at the No. 1 spot, garnered his third straight All-American first-team honors with his national title and was named Ivy League Player of the Year.
Junior Richard Hill, playing No. 2 for Harvard at the team and individual championships, earned a spot on the All-America Second Team after going 9-6 on the season and winning a first-round battle at the CSA Individual Championships.
Freshman Jason Michas had an impressive first individual championship appearance, winning four matches on his way to the Malloy Cup finals. But in the final match, Michas fell to Yale junior Christopher Plimpton in five games, dropping the last of these games by the tight margin of 11-9.
“Overall, we came through in the clutch moments,” West said. “But we didn’t achieve everything that we wanted to.”
The spring season started out strong, with four straight victories for the Crimson against Brown, Williams, Dartmouth, and Cornell. Then-No. 3 Rochester handed the Crimson its first loss, 7-2, on Jan. 23, though West and freshman Alexander Ma picked up wins for Harvard. The squad remained unfazed by the defeat, though, and continued to top lesser-ranked opponents.
“We started out with a couple of very narrow wins against competition we would normally [have] beaten,” West said. “But then we had some really good wins after that.”
Harvard also picked up a win against Penn, 7-2, in the regular season and recorded another close victory over Cornell at the CSA National Team Championships.
In the squash regular season, at least for Harvard, national rankings were easily distinguishable, with the fifth-ranked Crimson suffering four losses to the four teams ranked ahead of it: Trinity, Yale, Rochester, and Princeton.
“We didn’t have any huge upsets like we had last year,” co-captain Frank Cohen said. “But I think it was a good season, and I think what we’re most proud of is not necessarily the results, but rather the team that we created.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
28 seasons, 11 Ivy League titles, 6 NCAA tournament appearances.
With those numbers, coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has undoubtedly elevated the Harvard women’s basketball program to new heights.
At the beginning of this season, the Crimson fielded a team comprised entirely of underclassmen, yet the expectations to win the team’s 12th Ivy League title remained the same.
“We were trying to keep up with the tradition of Harvard, and that’s winning the Ivy championship,” junior co-captain Christine Matera said. “We knew that there would be obstacles and that we would have to grow over the course of the season...We expected everybody to grow up faster and contribute a little earlier.”
With the bar set high, Harvard (20-9, 11-3 Ivy) certainly exceeded opponents’ expectations this season with a strong second-place finish in the Ivy League. While the Crimson fell just short of an Ivy title for the second straight year—this time at the hands of Princeton—the team garnered its second consecutive WNIT berth.
“To be honest, I fully expected us to contend for the title, and I fully expected us to win the title,” Delaney-Smith said. “We had enough talent to win, and with players like [junior] Emma [Markley] and [sophomore] Brogan [Berry], I thought we had enough experience to build around. But I think we were just one or two players short depth-wise, and injuries really took a toll on us.”
With the dominance of All-Ivy forward Markley inside the paint and the sharp-shooting of Matera, the Crimson certainly had plenty of options to score offensively, with four players—Markley, Matera, Berry, and freshman forward Victoria Lippert–averaging more than 10 points a game.
“Offense is definitely our strength,” Matera said. “We’re very well-rounded offensively, and we know how to share the ball.”
In particular, the emergence of Lippert provided Harvard with a versatile scoring threat. Her strong freshman campaign earned her second-team All-Ivy honors.
“I feel that Victoria is getting much better,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a kind of kid who can dominate the game, particularly on offense, and she can score on offense 30 different ways.”
The Crimson’s offensive attack was on full display in its first game of the season, an 82-81 upset victory over crosstown rival Boston College. More importantly, though, the win gave the team the confidence it needed to make an Ivy title run.
“The BC game really set the tone for the rest of the season,” Matera said. “That was a huge win and got us off on the right foot from the get-go.”
But with an injury to junior co-captain and forward Claire Wheeler halfway through the season, Delaney-Smith was forced to play even more of her younger players. And while rookies Miriam Rutzen and Lippert played admirably on the court, the lack of intangibles such as leadership and team chemistry eventually caught up with Harvard, costing the team a couple of crucial conference games.
“In the first Princeton game, we were up by 10, but once [Princeton] started hitting some threes, that’s when you expect your synergy and leadership to come in,” Delaney-Smith said. “For us, it didn’t kick in, and we lost our confidence.”
“When you bring in a large class like our freshmen, chemistry does not automatically happen,” Delaney-Smith added. “It’s a process that you work on every day on the court and off the court.”
Yet the Crimson kept on finding ways to win, notching victories in eight consecutive league games before falling to Princeton, 78-66, at the end of the season.
While Harvard’s offensive prowess was instrumental in keeping the Crimson in contention for a title, Delaney-Smith attributed the team’s shortcomings in defense and rebounding as the main reason for finishing in second place.
“I tried seven different things this year [for rebounding and defense]...but all the talk and drills in the world just aren’t doing it,” Delaney-Smith said. “We got better, but I still don’t have three legitimate rebounders on the team. I have two. We had stretches in several games where we were the best-defending team I’ve ever coached, so it isn’t that we don’t know how [to rebound and defend], it’s just not our mindset.”
Harvard will remain an offensive threat to conference opponents next season, but Delaney-Smith asserted that it will be other aspects of the game that will determine the Crimson’s success.
“The defense and rebounding–not offense–will dictate whether we win a title next season,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Resilience—that was the mantra of the Harvard women’s hockey team this season.
Though the Crimson was without its usual luxury of Olympic-level talent and was plagued by injuries all year, it still managed to earn home-ice advantage in the NCAA tournament after posting a 20-8-5 record (13-6-3 ECAC) with an undefeated nonconference slate.
“I think a lot of people doubted this team and didn’t think we were going to be very good at all this year, and we kind of came together behind that,” junior forward Kate Buesser said. “It felt good to prove people wrong and continue the success.”
Having graduated its top three scorers—two-time Olympic gold medalist Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Jenny Brine ’09, and Sarah Wilson ’09—Harvard  took solace in its star power at the other end of the ice, where senior goaltender Christina Kessler turned away other teams’ forwards at will. Kessler set the NCAA all-time career save percentage record in the 2009-10 campaign, becoming the Crimson’s all-time winningest netminder in what would be the final game of her career. When junior forward Liza Ryabkina returned from a dislocated knee in late November, all the pieces seemed to have fallen in place for Harvard.
After Ryabkina pushed the Crimson past Dartmouth in her first game back on the ice, Harvard hit its stride, twice shutting out the University of Minnesota in one weekend. The Gophers hadn’t been blanked since 2007.
“The Minnesota series was great,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “That certainly made us believers.”
But Ryabkina and Kessler only had six games together before a torn ACL ended Kessler’s collegiate career.
“I think we had one period of hockey all season where everyone was healthy,” Stone said. “We recognize that we were resilient.”
In Kessler’s absence, co-captains Cori Bassett and Kathryn Farni and junior Leanna Coskren took charge. The trio’s blue-line stability helped freshman netminder Laura Bellamy step into a heated ECAC playoff race without missing a beat. Bellamy posted three shutouts and an overall record of 10-5-2 between the pipes.
“That’s a tough role to fill after Kessler, and she did a great job,” Stone said.
With its defense shutting the opposition down, Harvard demonstrated versatility, creativity, and grit on offense. Instead of weakening the Crimson, the graduation of star forwards allowed Harvard to diversify its offense, finding heroes in unexpected places.
“Everyone on the team took it upon themselves to find whatever their role was,” Farni said. “I think people were really self-aware of what needed to be done and what was appropriate for them to do.”
The skaters excelled in their roles in early February, when the Crimson opened the month by extending a win streak to six games and taking the Beanpot title.
When RPI stopped the streak, putting the Crimson’s playoff positioning in jeopardy, an unlikely star raised her game to a new level. Senior forward Randi Griffin, a role player for much of her career, found her niche as a scorer at the perfect time. In the last weekend of the ECAC regular season, with postseason seedings on the line, the senior scored the game-winning goal against St. Lawrence.
The next afternoon, she scored all three of Harvard’s goals in a 3-3 tie with Clarkson—giving the Crimson the third seed in the playoffs.
“We had a great group of kids who got better and better all the time due to the strong leadership of our seniors,” Stone said.
In its first playoff series, Harvard dominated Princeton, taking both games by a combined margin of seven goals. But it was all heartbreak after the easy victories over the Tigers. Clarkson kept the Crimson out of the ECAC championship game with a 3-2 victory in the conference semifinals. Harvard’s season then ended in the first round of the NCAA tournament, as it dropped a 6-2 contest to upstart Cornell—which would make a run all the way to the NCAA championship game—at home.
“We were disappointed with how we played down the stretch,” Stone said. “Our expectations had grown.”
But even in the loss, it was fitting that a Crimson skater, Coskren, scored the final goal against Cornell. Harvard, having overcome obstacles all season, was unwilling to stop fighting, even in the face of a five-goal deficit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So here’s how I originally wanted to open my Harvard Crimson Sports farewell article:
“The first piece that I wrote for the Harvard Crimson Sports Board was published in February 2009, almost a year and a half before my upcoming graduation. Naive and extremely motivated, I set out to write heart-wrenching, inspiring stories about Harvard’s varsity teams in an entertaining and evocative manner. Here, I will attempt to revisit some of Harvard’s most memorable sports moments, a few of which I had the pleasure of covering as an eager reporter.”
There are a few problems with that opening. For one, it sucks. Not much to break down there. Sucks.
Secondly, it is the lede for a bad article that no one gives a frock about. If I don’t want to sit here and write a pretentious curtain-call piece about how my periodic game recaps were somehow profound, then you sure as heck don’t want to read one.
Instead, I’ll just bow out with some banter about the challenges that we Harvard sportswriters face, hopefully get two or three laughs out of you, and call it a career.
At a school where the athletes are only marginally stronger and faster than the math nerds, whose hourly spin-moves in and out of Cabot Science Library would come in handy for the coaches across the river, sometimes it’s tough to engage sports fans. With the bleachers mostly empty at all but the most infamous of our rivalry matchups, nobody’s getting paper cuts frantically flipping to the sports section.
As my peers and I packed into the Crimson conference room to start the comp process last spring, we had no idea what we were in for. We knew that the comp process would be demanding and that we would have to scribble notes about sports we had never heard of as if we were die-hard fans.
We knew that we would have to blow good money on shoddy digital voice recorders from that dusty RadioShack by the Garage, just so we could shove them in the faces of exasperated coaches who had extended their historic losing streaks moments before. What we didn’t know, however, was that, truly, no one cared.
Allow me to elaborate. As sportswriters and editors, we attempt to make every win into Michael Jordan’s “The Shot” in 1989 and every choke into The Curse of the Bambino. We take the gift of gab—oh, sorry, the BS skills—that got us to this great institution and dress our tales of Harvard sporting events in diamonds and pearls as if they were our own resumes.
Take the atrocious first sentence I ever published in THC Sports:
“It might be hard to believe, but there is something better than the butternut squash soup served in the dining halls on Tuesdays.”
Not only was that statement a corny, cheapshot pun that I used to introduce an article about Harvard men’s squash, but it was also a bold-faced lie. Nothing touches the soup.
Does our readership increase for more than a day when we depict moderately-exciting Ivy League games as if they were Olympic contests between athletes from warring countries? For fear of being wrong, I’m not going to include any stats on this one, but we will just go with, “No”.
What was the author thinking when he referred to a lucky fourth-quarter three-pointer with butt-ugly form as a “rainbow set shot that appeared to pause momentarily at its peak?” Well it was me, and I wasn’t thinking. I’m all for colorful writing, but I mean, what happened to journalistic integrity?
What some of my fellow writers and I learned during our time here is that sensationalizing every sporting event that we can is a waste of time. We are Harvard. Our mascot is a color. We juice with Adderall, not anabolic steroids. We are going to have bad games and bad teams.
But that is exactly what makes sports here so special. On occasions when Harvard resembles a big-name sports school, students momentarily achieve a level of confidence, and even a level of intoxication, that we long for during all-nighters in the library.
After a big win, an aura that Ron Burgundy would describe as “scrumtrulescent” sweeps this campus, as we cherish the few truly legendary sports moments that we are entitled to experience. And that is why we write.
Before I go, I just want to be transparent about a few things. I’m a washed-up senior who is grumpy about leaving and somewhat emotionally unstable due to fear of the unknown. Because of sheer apathy, I haven’t written a single article this semester.
Hopefully I haven’t spoken too much for all of our sportswriters, but I think we value the unique contribution of Harvard sports to our college lives. We all get a kick out of this place when it doesn’t look anything like this place. It’s up to the reader to see it from our angle.
Hope this helped. Go to some games. Peace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard women’s golf team, the 2009-10 campaign can be best described as bittersweet.
Despite putting together a season filled with victories—including a six-tournament winning streak—the Crimson fell short of its ultimate goal: capturing a third straight Ivy League title.
“We played really well and accomplished a lot of things up until the last week of our season, but the fact that we finished it in a way that we hadn’t hoped for tainted the whole year,” incoming captain Mia Kabasakalis said.
Although freshman Katie Sylvan earned the title of Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and sophomore teammate Christine Cho—last year’s top newcomer—was honored as Player of the Year, Harvard ended its season with a disappointing third-place finish at the Ivy League championships in late April.
But the Crimson started out the year with a bang, placing seventh out of 18 teams at Golf Week’s Conference Challenge in mid-September. Its performance among some of the top teams in the nation earned it votes in the Golf World/NGCA Division I Coaches’ Poll—a first in the history of Harvard women’s golf.
“The field in that tournament is pretty similar to the field that we would see at the NCAA regionals,” said outgoing captain Claire Sheldon, whose consistently strong play throughout the year earned her a spot on the All-Ivy Second Team. “It speaks to the level of play that we’re capable of when we’ve had more time to practice.”
Following a second-place finish at Princeton the next week, the squad continued to improve, winning at Yale and at Lehigh to finish out the fall season.
The members of the Crimson then headed indoors for the winter to hone their games, and their hard work clearly paid off. The team’s early momentum carried over into the spring season, when Harvard returned quickly to its winning ways.
Once again playing outdoors, the squad took down Central Florida and Lynn in head-to-head matchups in Florida in March. Next came the Dartmouth Spring Invitational, where the Crimson nabbed the top prize with a dominant 38-stroke victory.
And in its final regular season tournament of the year, Harvard once again came up big.
Avenging a second-place finish at Columbia’s Roar-EE Invitational the year before, the squad placed first out of the 14-team field—which included all of the Ivy teams that would be represented at the Ivy League championships a week later.
To many observers it looked as if Harvard was ready to take home yet another Ancient Eight championship and cement its status as a dynasty in the Northeast.
“I think we were actually playing better [than we ever had in the last two years],” Sheldon said. “We had more team members playing well than we ever had...We were definitely trending in the direction where if we continued to do the things that we had been doing, we probably would have won.”
But the three-peat was not to be, as the two-time defending champions fell behind on the first day and were unable to make up ground over the next two rounds, ultimately ending up in third—25 strokes behind first-place Penn.
“Unfortunately, we didn’t play well when we needed to,” Sheldon said. “This year, it just didn’t happen...We had an off week when we needed to be on.”
“I honestly think that we prepared as best as we could have for that tournament,” Kabasakalis added. “There really wasn’t anything different from last year...if you look at our year as a whole—and the last couple of years—that was one bad weekend out of how many? I think next year we’ll have renewed energy and motivation, and hopefully we’ll look at it as a fluke.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the world of sports, it’s probably fair to conclude that squash is not one of the most widely known games.
But with its dominating performance this season, the Harvard women’s squash team is chipping away at the status quo.
“We had set ourselves the goal of winning nationals and the Ivy League title,” freshman Natasha Kingshott said. “We knew we had a strong team, but we didn’t want to be complacent. We knew other schools were training hard, and we had to match them...We knew if we put the effort in we would be successful.”
Kingshott was right—the squad’s campaign was nearly flawless.
The Crimson played a perfect season, winning all 12 of its matches en route to claiming its 17th Ivy League title, 11th Barhite Award (given for the best dual record nationally), and 12th national championship.
10 of the 15 athletes posted undefeated records, and not a single match was dropped at the No. 1, 5, 7, 8, or 9 positions.
The crew entered the season ranked No. 2, but after blanking its first four opponents, Harvard slid into the top slot. The team did not relinquish the position for the rest of the season.
“We have one of the most mentally tough teams out there,” co-captain Johanna Snyder said prior to nationals in February. “We go out there, and we give it our all.”
This mentality was undoubtedly a huge asset in the group’s third match against Dartmouth. Shouting malicious and chauvinistic jabs, the Big Green fans berated the Crimson athletes. The behavior even elicited an apology from Dartmouth president Jim Yong Kim to Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust.
But the Crimson brushed the attacks aside.
“When we walked into different venues, we were always classy,” co-captain Katherine O’Donnell said. “We faced a lot of adversity with fans and other situations, but we did a good job of staying classy, and it made me proud to be part of a team like that.”
In its fifth match, the squad had to again prepare itself mentally for the toughest competition yet against Trinity. Down in Hartford, Conn., the team pulled out a grueling 7-2 victory.
“They have a very strong roster with a lot of international players,” Kingshott said of the Bantams. “It was one of our first tight contests...It got us rolling for the latter half of the season, where we faced a lot of tough competition.”
In the second half of the season, Harvard’s opponents all occupied the top 10 of the national rankings—stiff competition, no doubt. The most anticipated matchup, though, was the one against Princeton.
“They beat us in the national final last year [5-4], and nobody on the team had ever beaten Princeton,” freshman Laura Gemmell said.
Victory was that much sweeter, then, when the Crimson finally defeated the Tigers, 6-3.
“It was a really intense, tough game that we needed to get through,” Snyder said. “But we knew we had the skill, the talent, the team, and the heart to do it.”
Later at the CSA National Championships in New Haven, Conn., the team entered with a 9-0 record and a target on its back as the top seed. Over the weekend, Harvard beat Williams, Yale, and finally Penn to win the national title amidst excitement and tears.
“The reason that we were so successful is that people on our team work harder than the competition,” Gemmell said. “Everyone is giving 110 percent every time.”
The squad also sent nine women—over half of the team—to the CSA Individual National Championships the following weekend.
There, Gemmell became the 11th Crimson athlete to win the Ramsay Cup, earning the title of national champion in the A division. Playing alongside her in the same bracket was Snyder, who made it to the quarterfinals.
In the B division, O’Donnell, like Snyder, concluded her collegiate squash career with a strong performance. O’Donnell won the division title, earning her the Holleran Cup.
Yet the team’s successes extend far beyond the postseason. Since nationals, many of the players have garnered numerous accolades and awards.
Gemmell was named to the CSA All-American First Team, and four of her teammates were tabbed for the second team: Snyder, junior Alisha Mashruwala (her third selection), sophomore Nirasha Guruge (her second selection), and junior June Tiong.
In addition, Gemmell and Guruge were named to the All-Ivy League team. The selection marks the second time for Guruge. Gemmell was also named the Ivy League Rookie and Player of the Year.
With such a young group of talent, the team is absolutely a strong contender to capture the national title once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask any event planner at the Harvard School of Public Health for a room, and he or she will recommend Kresge 502.
Furnished with swivel chairs and hanging flat-screen TVs, the auditorium lends itself well to interactive seminars and multimedia lectures for large groups.
Too bad it’s almost always booked. For the School of Public Health, the University’s decision in December to halt construction indefinitely in Allston left administrators and faculty scrambling to find temporary solutions to relieve the overcrowding of its cramped spaces.
With the promise of an additional 450,000 square feet of space, Allston would have lifted much of the pressure imposed by overcrowding at the school, which hampered its ability to expand its teaching and research facilities.
Recognizing that a prospective move to Allston was no longer a realistic medium-term solution, School of Public Health officials began efforts this past year to reorganize existing space for maximum use and explore options for leasing additional space in the Longwood Medical Area.
“We are at capacity—I mean, you should see schedules,” says Nancy M. Kane, the school’s associate dean of educational programs. “It takes a computer doing advanced linear programming just to figure out when to schedule a class, and you’re always going to conflict with someone.”
“It’s a nightmare,” Kane adds.
‘BURSTING AT THE SEAMS’
In the fall of 2008, the School of Public Health launched an alternative case-based core curriculum for MPH students based on an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving in public health.
Kane turned to the only room on the school’s campus equipped to facilitate the face-to-face classroom interaction the new curriculum aimed to create—Kresge 502.
The few rooms that can accommodate the 60 students enrolled in the new curriculum, Kane says, did not offer the semicircular seating unique to Kresge 502 and would have been ineffectual for class discussions.
“You don’t really see each other,” Kane says. “You just see the back of each other’s heads.”
Just a three-minute walk from Kresge, nutrition and epidemiology professor Meir J. Stampfer says existing lab space is not enough to support the school’s growing body of federally funded research.
“It’s not just about getting the grant money,” Stampfer says. “Once you get the grant, you have to have the space to do the research.”
His lab, Stampfer says, recently received funding for more personnel, but he and his team had difficulty finding space to accommodate the new hires.
“It’s just very frustrating because we really don’t have enough space for ourselves,” Kane adds about the school’s space constraints. “They rebuilt downstairs and made more student space, but we’re bursting at the seams.”
MAKING DO
At the end of his first year as School of Public Health Dean, Julio Frenk was saddled with the responsibility of finding a suitable solution for the school’s cramped quarters until the University was ready to move forward on Allston.
“We’re in a state of overcrowding that’s really not sustainable in the long term,” Frenk says.
Though plans are not finalized at this point, Frenk says school officials have identified potential space to be leased in Longwood.
The School of Public Health is also exploring collaborating with Harvard Medical School to share working spaces until financial resources can support any expansionary plans, according to David J. Hunter, the School of Public Health’s dean for academic affairs.
Stampfer adds that his department is reorganizing internally to maximize use of existing space.
“Right now, we’re just squeezing more and more people into the space,” Stampfer says. “We can do that for a little while, but ultimately, that is going to degrade the quality of the experience.”
Similarly, other schools like the Harvard Graduate School of Education—which was promised a piece of the Allston campus that the University envisioned in 2003—have had to reevaluate plans to reflect the changed timeline of Allston expansion.
“We are making improvements to our campus through the construction of new classrooms and better utilization of space,” says Graduate School of Education Dean Kathleen McCartney.
Faculty and administrators at schools affected by the indefinite halt in Allston expansion say the problem is not unmanageable.
“It hasn’t reached the point that it’s starting to impair our ability to function,” says Stampfer, who adds that he appreciates the school administration’s efforts to find temporary solutions to relieve the issue of cramped space on campus.
“People are crammed into small spaces and crowded so it’s not optimal, but it’s doable,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a typical Wednesday night. Twenty Harvard Business School first-years cross the Charles to one of Harvard Square’s several bars—Redline, Tommy Doyle’s, Daedalus.
Going out four, five times a week, the students, most in their twenties, don’t dare skip a social function for fear of missing out—or “FOMO,” (pronounced FOH-MOE), as they say.
For them, a Harvard MBA is worth more than just an Ivy League education.
The brand-name degree is their ticket to an ever-growing global network of influence (and affluence), as the school’s alumni base includes CEOs of leading multinational corporations and financial firms as well as a former United States president.
But in the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis many blamed on reckless lending and poor risk management, critics questioned the value of the MBA, the two-year education meant to churn out future titans of industry.
In the past year alone, Business School professors Rakesh Khurana, Srikant M. Datar and David A. Garvin ’74 have published academic writings exploring the place of the MBA education in today’s society, prompting much discussion and reevaluation at business schools nationwide.
At Harvard, a new Business School curriculum will likely be implemented by the winter semester of 2012, according to Business School professor Thomas R. Eisenmann ’79, which provides an opportunity to adapt to new demands and address renewed concerns about the MBA program.
“Students increasingly saw the elite MBA as a place to develop a social network rather than acquire a professional education,” Khurana says. “In other words, elite MBA programs were becoming more like finishing schools rather than professional schools.”
NIGHTS OUT ON THE TOWN
Coming into Harvard, most Business School students acknowledge that much of the Harvard MBA’s value is derived from outside the classroom: the access to rich networks at social functions, the brand name degree—essentially, the promise of a better and brighter future.
“Business School students have a reputation of taking advantage of the social scene,” says John Coleman, who will graduate from the Business School this year with a joint degree from Harvard Kennedy School.
First-years especially feel pressure from their peers to go out and mingle at social events—because “they feel like they should,” says M. Scott Daubin, a former Student Association Co-President graduating this May.
“People are going out all the time in the beginning of their first year, because of FOMO,” Daubin says, adding that the pressure lessens with time.
Reflecting on their time at the Business School, this year’s crop of graduates stresses the importance of maintaining a vibrant social life to cement relationships with their peers—connections that may come in handy later in their careers.
“You come for a two-year program that’s about finding your career,” A. Kayode Ogunro ’05 says. “You expect to leave with a solid network of friends and alumni—you’re here to prepare for a professional career.”
FUTURE INDUSTRY TITANS
Business School professor Jay W. Lorsch does not express surprise when he hears that some students see their experience at Harvard as positioning, not preparing, them for their careers.
“There has been some criticism that the MBA isn’t what it used to be,” Lorsch says. “We’ve been asking ourselves, ‘Are we really equipping students to serve society as the best business leaders?’”
Critics speaking out against the value of the MBA after the financial crisis struck emphasize the need to integrate more comprehensive ethics and risk management training into business school curricula for a more relevant education.
Over the past year, the Business School, which regularly updates its curriculum, created new courses on managing modern financial firms and understanding the history of financial crises, according to Joseph L. Badaracco, senior associate dean and chair of the MBA program.
Though several faculty committees are still discussing preliminary ideas for curricular reform, Badaracco says that they may recommend allowing for more flexibility in the final term of the MBA program.
Students may be able to take a six-week course or conduct a field study off campus, Badaracco explains, adding that this proposal would offer more hands-on experience.
Personal leadership development will likely be a focus of a possible series of small-scale courses running in tandem with the regular curriculum, and the school may invite venture capitalists on campus each week with business plans for students to analyze, Badaracco adds.
With curricular reform planning underway, faculty say they hope students will reap benefits of a more relevant MBA education.
“The Harvard name will always be attractive,” Lorsch says. “The name will help you get contacts, but hopefully you’ll get an education.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How does an athlete manage to climb to the top of the national rankings, post an undefeated record, and claim the individual national title—all in her first season?
If you’re Laura Gemmell, you make it look easy.
In her rookie season, Gemmell compiled a spotless 16-0 overall record at the No. 1 position on the Harvard women’s squash team. She also won the CSA individual championships in a drawn-out five-game match.
Then, in the aftermath of the season, she picked up numerous awards and accolades, including Ivy League Player of the Year.
“She’s a great leader on the court,” freshman Natasha Kingshott said. “She brings a new level to the game.”
Before considering her athletic skill, impressive alone is the fact that Gemmell started in the top slot for the Crimson. As a result, her matches often pitted her against upperclassmen.
“It can be really frightening as a freshman to face off against a senior who’s been playing for four years,” co-captain Johanna Snyder said.
But Gemmell’s experience in the junior national circuit—she came to Cambridge with 21 national-championship titles under her belt—helped allay any fears she may have had in preseason.
“I was more excited to play No. 1 on the Harvard team [than nervous],” Gemmell said.
Gemmell first took to the courts against Williams in the squad’s second match of the season. Her opponent was senior Toby Eyre, a three-time All-American and one of the three players ranked above Gemmell at the start of the season.
Three games later, Gemmell had the first win of her collegiate career. The sweep, coming with scores of 11-6, 11-7, 11-8, was the first of many.
“She’s so confident in her squash,” Snyder said. “In a freshman, you don’t find that very often.”
Later in the season, with six victories to her name, Gemmell was set to face Penn’s Kristen Lange—another three-time All-American who was ranked above Gemmell coming into the season.
Gemmell, though, was unfazed; Lange fell, 11-3, 11-9, 11-7, as the Crimson defeated the Quakers, 8-1.
“She’s one of the most dedicated players that I’ve ever seen,” Kingshott said. “I had great respect for her before Harvard...She has the perfect balance of being serious about the sport and also being able to take a step back.”
Gemmell, though, is quick to credit her coaches for her success.
“My coaches were really helpful to me,” she said. “I think my game developed a lot since last year...Working hard and the coaching I received helped me play some solid squash, especially at nationals.”
Gemmell’s first national exposure as a member of a college team was at the CSA National Championships in New Haven, Conn. En route to Harvard’s victory, Gemmell again took out the broom, sweeping Williams’ Eyre and Penn’s Lange. In the second of the three matches, she also swept Yale’s Logan Greer.
Then, a week later, Gemmell returned to Yale’s courts for the CSA Individual Championships, where she hoped to fulfill her goal of becoming a national champion.
After making it to the quarterfinals, Gemmell encountered a rather unexpected opponent—her teammate Alisha Mashruwala, the captain for the 2010-11 season.
But Gemmell was unaffected by this matchup; she swept Mashruwala and then Yale’s Greer for a second time to make it to the finals.
In between Gemmell and the Ramsay Cup was Trinity’s Pamela Hathway.
Hathway, a junior, had uprooted the Bantams’ Nour Bahgat from her No. 1 position—an impressive feat considering Bahgat was the defending national champion.
The match was the closest of Gemmell’s season. After capturing the first game, Gemmell dropped the next two to Hathway. It was then do-or-die for the rookie.
The freshman snagged an 11-8 win in the fourth game, setting up the tiebreaker.
Deep into the fifth, the athletes were tied at nine apiece.
Gemmell then won the next two points to become the national champion.
“I had a tough five-game match in the final,” Gemmell recalled. “My coach definitely pulled me through.”
Yet, as national champion, Ivy League Rookie and Player of the Year, CSA All-American, member of the All-Ivy team, and team MVP, Gemmell is still looking to improve.
“I’m going to focus on squash this summer,” Gemmell said. “I’m going to Australia to compete in the World University Games… I have to get my strength and conditioning up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team had trouble finding its rhythm during the 2009-10 season.
Despite encouraging efforts in January, the Crimson (9-21-3, 7-12-3 ECAC) finished the ECAC regular season in ninth place. In the ECAC playoffs, Harvard swept Princeton in the first round before falling to Cornell in the quarterfinals.
“It wasn’t the season that we hoped for,” captain Alex Biega said. “We definitely had a very skilled team and close team. However, it really didn’t translate on the ice for us.”
The Crimson began the year with a 5-3 win over Dartmouth, but Harvard could not build on the victory, and the squad endured an 0-8-2 skid over the next 10 games.
The disappointing stretch featured several third-period breakdowns.
Against Colgate on Nov. 6, Cornell on Nov. 7, and Clarkson on Nov. 21, the Crimson relinquished leads by giving up multiple goals in the final frame. Over the course of the season, Harvard was outscored, 51-32, in the third period and overtime.
“I think we had a bad start [to the season] and dug ourselves a hole,” Biega said. “What happened was it was very hard to get out of that hole. It was difficult to play with the confidence we needed to.”
After a 20-day break in December, Harvard returned to the ice reenergized. The Crimson reeled off four ECAC wins in a row over then-No. 8 Quinnipiac, then-No. 5 Yale, Dartmouth, and then-No. 13 Union.
During the four-game ECAC winning streak, Harvard allowed just five goals. Junior goaltender Kyle Richter had a 36-save performance in the 3-1 defeat of Quinnipiac, and classmate Ryan Carroll registered 47 saves in the 4-1 win over Union. Carroll and Richter finished the year with goals against averages of 2.87 and 3.30, respectively.
“I think a lot of times the camaraderie within the system was high,” Biega said. “[In January], I think we were really rolling on some confidence.”
The Crimson’s 3-2 victory over Yale on Jan. 12 was the team’s most impressive regular-season effort. The Bulldogs went on to win the ECAC regular-season title and earned a bid to the NCAA tournament, in which they lost to eventual national champion Boston College.
“[It was] probably one of our most complete games...our guys have battled and I think they got rewarded,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 on Jan. 12.
Against Yale, the Crimson benefited from a two-goal performance by freshman Louis Leblanc.
The first-year forward led Harvard with 11 goals and 23 points for the year. Junior Michael Biega paced the team with 15 assists.
Although the Crimson seemed to find its stride in the ECAC, Harvard took a step back in the 2010 Beanpot.
In the first round against Boston College, the Crimson committed 17 penalties and suffered a 6-0 defeat. In the consolation round, Northeastern bested Harvard, 4-1.
“It’s obviously very disappointing to our team, especially on such a great national stage,” Biega said of the loss to BC on Feb. 2. “I think, quite simply, we just got outplayed by the better team tonight.”
Harvard could not rebound from its Beanpot struggles and finished in ninth place in the ECAC after losing its final four league games.
In the ECAC playoffs, the Crimson traveled to Princeton and upset the Tigers in the first round. Harvard earned a series sweep with 4-2 and 3-0 victories.
In the ECAC quarterfinals, Cornell put an end to the Crimson’s season. The Big Red swept Harvard, winning, 5-1 and 3-0.
“We’re all pretty disappointed in the season we had,” senior forward Doug Rogers said after the Cornell series on Mar. 16. “We played well against Princeton and played hard against Cornell, and in the end that’s really all you can control.”
Sophomore Alex Killorn, who finished third on the team with 20 points, seconded Rogers’ comments.
“The season overall was a little bit of a disappointment at the end,” Killorn said. “Looking forward, I think we have a great core group of guys to do something special next year.”
Six Crimson seniors—captain Alex Biega, Jack Christian, Chad Morin, John Riley, Rogers, and Ian Tallett—finished their college careers in 2010.
“They’re just great leaders and great individuals,” Biega said of the senior class. “Even though it didn’t translate to trophies, just being in the setting of Harvard hockey is unbelievable, and I cherish it every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Talk about a season for the record books.
Winning numerous matches, titles, and awards, the Harvard women’s squash team epitomized success. The squad captured a spotless 12-0 record and finished the season ranked first nationally—no small feat.
Ranked No. 2 in the preseason, the team started off with several scrimmages against Ivy League opponents. Afterward, the Crimson kicked its season off by blanking its first four opponents.
Brown, Williams, and Dartmouth each fell, 9-0, to Harvard on their respective courts. Even more impressive, the Crimson lost only two games in the four-match stretch.
In Providence, R.I., the Crimson defeated No. 10 Brown to open its 2009-10 campaign. The squad next swept No. 8 Williams to improve to 2-0 on the young season.
The win total increased again after Harvard defeated No. 9 Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H.
Then, in the Crimson’s first home match of the season, the team soundly defeated No. 6 Cornell, 9-0, on Dec. 5. In doing so, the group climbed the national rankings to the No. 1 position.
“The Ivy scrimmages and the first match in November [against Brown] were a big test for us,” co-captain Katherine O’Donnell said. “[Co-captain] Johanna [Snyder] and I and some of the other girls were injured, but we still won. Everyone showed what they could do.”
Following this string of dominant wins, the team was faced with its toughest competition yet: Trinity. Known for its historically strong squash program, the Bantams also listed Nour Bahgat—the holder of the CSA Individual National Championship title for the 2008-09 season—on its roster. Even more unsettling, though, was the fact that Bahgat was playing not in the top slot anymore, but at No. 3.
“We knew they’d be one of the best teams,” Snyder said.
But Trinity too was no match for Harvard. The Crimson prevailed, 7-2.
Following the match against the Bantams, Harvard traveled back to Cambridge for a three-game home stretch where even tougher competition awaited.
Less than 24 hours after facing Trinity, the Crimson took on Stanford at the Barnaby Courts. Seven Harvard players swept their opponents to give the team a satisfying 8-1 victory.
Then came the month of February—the most important block in the team’s schedule.
After an 8-1 win against No. 3 Penn, the Crimson faced its most anticipated contest of the year: the matchup with No. 4 Princeton.
In the 2008-09 season, the Tigers defeated Harvard twice by a margin of only one game in each match. Even more heartbreaking, the second matchup between the Ancient Eight rivals was in the finals of the national championship.  At the season’s end, every member of the Crimson team had yet to see victory against Princeton.
A win this year, then, represented more than merely preserving an unblemished record—it was about finally capturing what had eluded every Crimson athlete on the team.
With a 6-3 win, the athletes cleared this final looming hurdle. They also clinched a share of the Ivy League title.
“It was a huge win,” freshman Natasha Kingshott said. “Nobody on the team had beaten them before...It was kind of revenge, almost.”
In the last match of the season, the Crimson beat No. 5 Yale, 7-2, in New Haven, Conn. As a result, the group was awarded the Ivy League title as well as the Barhite Award, given to the team with the best dual record nationally.
Then came the CSA National Championships from Feb. 26-28. Harvard defeated Williams, Yale, and Penn to accomplish the team’s biggest goal—winning a national title. In the individual championships a week later, freshman Laura Gemmell claimed victory in the A division and her teammate O’Donnell won in the B division.
Even though the team’s future is not entirely certain—new players as well as a new coach will be entering the mix—the group is focused and ready defend its national title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2009 Harvard football team boasted one of the toughest offensive lines in recent memory. Perhaps the only thing tougher was the expectation resting on the Crimson’s shoulders.
Harvard opened the year as two-time defending Ivy League champions and looked to make it a three-peat this season. Led by a stalwart line of seniors James Williams, John Paris, Ben Sessions, and Alex Spisak, along with junior Brent Osborne, the Crimson looked forward to a dominant running game and plenty of time to scramble for new junior starting quarterback Collier Winters.
Despite a pair of nonconference losses to Holy Cross—led by standout quarterback Dominic Randolph—and Lafayette, Harvard (7-3, 6-1 Ivy) accomplished its offensive goals and more in the Ivy season.
With the running back tandem of junior Gino Gordon and Ivy Rookie of the Year Treavor Scales, the Crimson exploded for 178.7 yards per game on the ground, more than 20 yards per game better than second-ranked Columbia. With Winters ably controlling the passing game to the tune of 15 touchdown passes, Harvard made a forceful statement with its league-leading 25.2 points per game en route to a 5-0 start in conference play.
“It’s always important when you get off the field [as a defense] knowing that the offense is going to stay on the field,” sophomore cornerback Matt Hanson said. “You get a break and know they are going to go down and score, so it gives you confidence...When you have that confidence, it’s hard to lose games.”
With wins over Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, and Columbia by at least 18 points, Harvard entered its mid-November matchup with undefeated Penn knowing that the league title rested on the outcome. But just as the pressure mounted for the Crimson, so too did the air pressure at Harvard Stadium. In the midst of a driving rainstorm that soaked the field, the Crimson could not find its footing against a nationally-recognized Quaker defense. Harvard fell, 17-7, to Penn (8-2, 7-0), essentially conceding the Ivy crown.
Still, losing its title hopes did not dampen the excitement for Crimson football. With the 126th playing of The Game left on the slate, Harvard ensured a memorable closure to the 2009 season. After spotting Yale a 10-0 lead through three quarters, the Crimson orchestrated a furious comeback—punctuated by a pair deep touchdown passes from Winters to senior Matt Luft and junior Chris Lorditch—that left the crowd at the Yale Bowl in shock. With Winters’ pair of bombs and a little help from a questionable fake punt call by the Bulldogs, Harvard escaped with a 14-10 exclamation point to its season.
“I think that especially after that Penn loss the previous week, the win [against Yale] made up for the hurt and disappointment that we had that week,” Winters said. “It was good to end on a good note and look forward to next season.”
Indeed, the Crimson has plenty to anticipate in 2010. No longer sporting a target on its back, Harvard knows it’s nonetheless a frontrunner for another Ivy championship. Although the loss of the core of its offensive line will undoubtedly be a setback, the Crimson will welcome back a number of key position players, perhaps none more important than its offensive backfield.
“Having the two running backs [Gordon and Scales] coming back that we do, the running game should be a positive for us,” Winters said. “We have a pretty inexperienced game-wise group of guys at the offensive line...For the most part, they did a great job in the spring, and I think that they’ll be able to step into their roles.”
In addition, Harvard’s defense—by no means lackluster in 2009—returns a strong secondary with first-team All-Ivy rising captain Collin Zych, who led the team with 73 tackles, and Hanson. The entire defense progressed steadily over the course of the season, highlighted by a performance against the second-ranked Lions’ rushing attack in which the Crimson pushed its opponent backwards for -18 net yards on the ground.
“[This season] we started to develop as a group,” Hanson said of the defense. “In spring ball we really picked it up as a group, playing together as a team. I’m really looking forward to that next year.”
With a number of starters returning and hungry for another taste of championship glory, it won’t be Harvard feeling the pressure in 2010. Just whatever team is on the other side of the ball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the puck dropped in the season opener for women’s hockey, Harvard had a new look up front. Gone were its top three scorers from a year ago—Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Jenny Brine ’09, and Sarah Wilson ’09. Temporarily missing was junior Liza Ryabkina, a dynamic forward who was sidelined for the season’s first month with a knee injury.
And into the void stepped junior Kate Buesser.
Though the winger had been a contributor in her first two years on the team—scoring a combined 26 points while playing in every game—it wasn’t until this season that she became a star.
“I was happy to fill in that role,” Buesser said. “Coming into the season, I prepared well, and I knew I was a good player out there. I just really wanted to show what we could do with this team.”
Buesser broke through in the fourth game of the season, scoring twice and notching an assist in the Crimson’s 3-0 win over St. Lawrence. And from that point on, she steadily emerged as the leader of Harvard’s new-look offense.
The junior finished the year with 40 points, more than double her career best of 16 and tied for the ECAC lead. For her efforts, Buesser was a top-three finalist for ECAC Player of the Year while being named to the All-ECAC and All-Ivy First Teams.
“It was a team effort,” Buesser explained. “I couldn’t have scored all those goals without the team helping out. It was that mental leap where you can’t just sit back anymore—you have to take the game in control.”
But just as her team supported her, Buesser helped her linemates succeed, dishing out 24 assists while finishing the season with a +25 rating—good for best in the conference.
Buesser spent much of the year playing with rookie center Jillian Dempsey, who wound up 10th in the country in rookie scoring, and Ryabkina—a line that consistently created scoring opportunities and combined for 14 points in four playoff games.
“I think it’s because we weren’t relying on one specific person or two specific people to do all of our scoring,” Buesser said. “We all knew that everyone was capable of scoring.”
Buesser had a career high in points in a November matchup with Quinnipiac, tallying a goal and adding three assists to go along with a +4 rating, but her consistency is what set her apart. Though she never scored more than twice in a game, very few contests went by where Buesser’s name didn’t show up on the score sheet.
“She was able to play how she wanted to play,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “I think she played without pressure, and that was awesome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For freshman hockey standout Jillian Dempsey, improving on the little things had big results in her rookie season. Sometimes getting better was just a matter of going to practice a little earlier or staying a little later, giving more effort in the weight room, and never being satisfied with a mediocre performance. These small adjustments, accompanied by immense talent, made not only for a star rookie, but for a great hockey player.
After watching Harvard hockey since the sixth grade, Dempsey’s dream came true when she was recruited to play for the team out of high school.
“I didn’t know what to expect coming onto the team, except that Coach [Katey] Stone had an amazing program,” Dempsey said. “But this is the best group of girls I’ve ever played with. It’s the greatest knowing that every time you went on the ice, you would get the best from everyone.”
Bolstered by the hard work of her team and the coaching of Stone, Dempsey was able to develop as a player and learn about the importance of the little things.
The freshman played in all 33 games of the season and earned spots on the ECAC All-Rookie Team and All-Ivy Second Team. The freshman was second on the team with 27 points on 11 goals and 16 assists and earned ECAC Rookie of the Week honors twice during the year.
“[Dempsey] did a tremendous job, as did all the freshmen, this year,” Stone said. “She played in key situations and was a smart player.”
“I think Jillian got a lot of confidence in the beginning of the year...and she just kept trying to get better every day,” junior Kate Buesser added.
Dempsey’s role was particularly crucial given that the offense lost four senior forwards to graduation following the 2009 season, and the defense lost All-American senior goaltender Christina Kessler to injury in January, opening the ice for new players with less experience.
“I think that we beat the odds a lot this year,” Dempsey said. “Especially after losing Kessler, people didn’t think we would do as well as we did.”
The rookie and her team finished 20-8-5 overall, swept Princeton in the ECAC quarterfinals, and garnered home ice for the NCAA quarterfinal against Cornell. Dempsey was responsible for two assists and a goal in the series against Princeton, keeping her team alive in the postseason.
But for the freshman, it has never been about individual success. When she improves or excels, Dempsey attributes the success to the motivation of her team and coach, and her simple love of the sport.
“I love the game,” Dempsey said. “I’ve loved it ever since I started to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, 2009-10 was the year of the dominant Harvard male athlete. Jeremy Lin captained the men’s basketball team to its best season ever and was a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award. Andre Akpan led men’s soccer to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament and was runner-up for the Hermann Trophy. And Colin West won a squash national title.
Yet each member of that group lost at some point during their solid senior seasons. J.P. O’Connor, on the other hand, was never beaten.
In the face of this extraordinarily talented group, the wrestling co-captain reigned supreme, standing out among extremely tough competition just as he had done all year long.
O’Connor finished off a brilliant collegiate career this season by winning a national championship—just the third in Crimson wrestling history—and tying the school’s all-time wins record.
“I’m so lucky to be able to finally win that national title that I had been working towards for four years, and to be able to do it for my family and for my coaches and for Harvard was pretty amazing,” O’Connor said. “I couldn’t have asked for a better way to finish my Harvard career.”
O’Connor was unstoppable from the get-go, finishing a perfect 35-0—the only undefeated season in Harvard history—and bringing his career record to 132-16.
The accolades that have come with that record have been many—three-time All-American, four-time EIWA finalist, two-time Ivy Wrestler of the Year, and the list goes on. But despite his impressive list of accomplishments, it is the captain’s character and leadership that elevate him to truly elite status.
“J.P. is very sincere in everything he does,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss wrote in a letter of recommendation. “He is one of the best wrestlers I have ever coached, but yet he concerns himself with others and those that have helped him along the way.”
O’Connor has led team community service projects at the Cambridge Homeless Shelter and with Habitat for Humanity and has excelled in the classroom too. Despite taking a pre-med courseload, O’Connor has maintained a high GPA and has been named a three-time Academic All-American.
“J.P. is a class act in every aspect of life,” Weiss wrote. “[He] epitomizes the type of athlete every coach wishes to have as part of his program—a leader who combines the ideals of athletic achievement, scholarship, and sportsmanship.”
O’Connor’s talent has been on display since the beginning of his career, when he became the Crimson’s first freshman All-American wrestler. But it has been his willingness to step up and lead in the face of adversity that has truly distinguished O’Connor from his peers.
For example, at the 2008 NCAA tournament, the then-sophomore O’Connor tore both his ACL and PCL. Despite being barely able to put on any weight on his injured leg, O’Connor—knowing he needed one more win to repeat his All-American status—went on to take down the defending national champion and display the type of determination that many enormously talented athletes lack.
“I have full confidence in putting J.P. in any type of leadership position and know his teammates will respect anything he does or says,” Weiss remarked in the letter. “He always puts the team ahead of himself.”
Of all his accomplishments, O’Connor had his greatest triumph this past March, when he blistered his way through the NCAA tournament, outscoring his opponents, 51-10, and leaving little doubt that he was the best collegiate wrestler the nation had to offer at 157 lbs.
In the finals, he defeated his rival, Chase Pami of Cal Poly, 6-4, to win the national title in front of 15,000 fans in Omaha, Neb.
“It was very surreal to work your whole life for a seven-minute match and then it’s over...it was almost like it didn’t happen,” O’Connor said. “I watched it the next day, and it brought a huge smile to my face. It finally was able to sink in—holy smokes, I won a national title.”
After finally achieving his career-long goal of winning a national championship, O’Connor has no desire to stop doing what he loves. He plans to stick around as a volunteer assistant for the Harvard wrestling team and to continue training with hopes of making the 2012 Olympic squad and representing his country in London.
“It’s going to be a long process. I’m just trying to get a lot of experience,” O’Connor said. “[International wrestling] is a different style. I’m starting at the bottom once again. It’s a new challenge for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1976, William F. Lee ’72 owned two suits—a blue Brooks Brothers and a white, bell-bottomed suit that might as well have been pulled from John Travolta’s wardrobe in Saturday Night Fever.
A soon-to-be graduate of Cornell Law, Lee hoped to break into Boston’s white-shoe legal firms where spots were traditionally reserved for white male graduates of Harvard Law School—not modest Asian kids from Philadelphia.
Thinking he had no chance of being hired at the “stodgy” Boston firm Hale and Dorr, now WilmerHale, Lee went with the white suit.
“I think it was the white suit,” John D. Hamilton, Jr.—a retired partner who hired Lee and saw him take on his job as one of the firm’s managing partners—recalls with a laugh.
One of America’s top intellectual property lawyers, a former Iran-Contra investigator, and as the newest member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—Lee now travels in the innermost circles of influence, while he maintains an enviable balance between work and family life.
Lee’s client list reads like a roster of America’s top multinational companies: Apple, Intel, Cisco, Proctor & Gamble. He wins national recognition for his litigation and manages to make all his kids’ weekend soccer games.
When he steps into Loeb House this summer as the newest Fellow of Harvard College, he will join the ranks of an exclusive club—the oldest corporation in the Western hemisphere whose size has not changed since its inception in the mid-seventeenth century.
And Lee, who resides in Wellesley, Mass., aims to go beyond a Corporation member’s monthly meeting responsibilities by engaging with the Harvard community on a more frequent basis.
KEEPING IN TOUCH
In one way, Lee hopes to emulate an older style of Corporation members who spend more time on campus.
When in Cambridge, Robert G. Stone, Jr. ’45, who served on the Corporation from 1975 until 2002, could often be seen at the Faculty Club huddled in conversation with a group of undergraduates—his way of feeling the University’s pulse.
But in recent years, Corporation members—who fly into Cambridge or sometimes conference call in for monthly meetings—have become increasingly removed from the University.
That distance, current and former members of the Corporation say, has not been all bad, as their outside perspective can lend a sense of objectivity in their oversight.
Lee, however, says he plans to have monthly dinners with students in Eliot House—his friend and stem cell guru Douglas Melton was recently appointed House Master—and possibly at the Harvard Graduate School of Education as well.
“I think there’s some advantage in my being local,” Lee says. “If you live and work in the greater Boston community, it’s very hard to go anywhere—a business, social, or legal function, or Fenway Park even—without people talking about Harvard, and it’s helpful to hear what the people across the street at City Hall are saying about Harvard.”
Since the announcement of his appointment in April, Lee has gone on a listening tour across the University, and by the time he formally joins the Corporation, he says he will have spoken to at least 40 deans, administrators, and faculty.
To hear him tell it, Lee will bring an openness to the Corporation which in recent years has been caricatured as a shadowy, secretive body.
Corporation meetings have always been closed to the public, and the minutes of their meetings are not released.
But in recent years under the leadership of James R. Houghton ’58, who will step down as Senior Fellow this June, the Corporation has shifted towards greater transparency and worked more regularly with the Board of Overseers, the relatively powerless second-tier governing body elected by alumni.
“For the first time in a long time, we have somebody who really lives in Boston,” Houghton says. “Having someone close who can come in on fairly short notice is a very good idea.”
A HARVARD MAN
This year, the Law School launched a course on problem solving, taught in part by Lee, who stepped in to offer a dose of practical perspective.
Displaying a photo of the Star Wars character Yoda, he told his students that one of the most important roles for an attorney is that of “wise counsel.”
On the last day of class, one of his students came to class in a Yoda costume, answering questions in a pitch-perfect impersonation of the diminutive green Jedi Master.
A photo of a beaming Lee with his arm around Yoda now hangs on his office wall.
But behind the affable, charismatic teacher is a man of immense discipline.
Lee says he rises early every morning to run four or five miles. Saturdays are for longer runs during which he can think about “the three biggest mistakes I’ve made during the course of the week,” Lee says.
“It started—I think—when I lost a case and I was feeling sorry for myself and I went out and took a run and thought I ought to think about something different,” he recalls.
In his intensity and work ethic—and perhaps most importantly his devotion to his family—Lee seems almost puritan, though Lee by no means wears the black hat and austere look of America’s earliest settlers.
Walking into a surprisingly modest office for the head of a multinational firm, Lee removes a robotic vacuum cleaner—the disc-like type that buzzes around on the floor and bumps into things—to make room for his visitors.
“Do you know the Army uses these to disarm bombs?” he asks, with no small measure of excitement.
Lee speaks with an animated directness that makes it easy to understand why he is known as such an effective courtroom operator. He answers questions with an analytic bent. (“Let me separate my answer into two parts.”)
But he is far from the figure of a dry corporate lawyer.
Lee once took his team of lawyers to Disneyland, spending the day riding Splash Mountain as they waited for two days in Southern California on a jury’s verdict.
When he travels, Lee departs slightly from his self-discipline—though only in the most modest of ways—treating himself to hotels whose locations support his running habit.
“I stay at hotels selected on the basis of whether there’s a great run,” Lee says. “I stay at the Pierre in New York because you can go right into the park, I stay at the Willard in D.C. because you can go to the mall, and I had this hotel in Amsterdam called the Amstel because I can go out and hit the canals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With too many awards to even fit in one article, it is safe to say that outgoing co-captain Andre Akpan is the most decorated soccer player to have ever been part of the Crimson program.
Having graduated from Harvard a semester early in his efforts to pursue an MLS career, Akpan is currently a striker for the Colorado Rapids and recently made his debut against the Kansas City Wizards in a U.S. Open Cup game last month.
This is not his first experience playing against high-level competition, though. To start off his international career with the United States U-20 team, Akpan scored a hat trick against Haiti and was influential in the country’s qualification for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup.
At the collegiate level, he enjoyed even more success, becoming the face of Harvard soccer and putting the program on the map with the help of the strongest class ever to have played for the Crimson. The graduating class even caught the attention of the 2008 MLS Cup Champions, the Columbus Crew, who selected classmate Kwaku Nyamekye late in the MLS SuperDraft this year. The class of 2010 has also appeared in the postseason every year and has won two Ivy League titles.
“Andre is a fantastic player and was a great leader for our team,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark wrote in an email. “His talent was clear to anyone who watched us play.  What not everyone saw was that he drove other players to compete and play at his level. His expectations at practice changed the habits and expectations of the team.  This standard of excellence grew from practice into the games and led to much of our success.”
And much of the team success can be attributed to Akpan’s leadership and prolific scoring abilities. By the end of his career, he had tallied the most points in Crimson history with 127 and had tied Chris Ohiri ’64’s career record of 47 goals.
“Andre was always a very hard worker,” incoming co-captain Jaren LaGreca said. “He was a leader on the team, and he held people to a high standard. That is something we need to have [among] the full team.”
Akpan’s efforts were recognized at the end of the season when he was named the first runner-up for the Hermann Trophy, a prestigious award that identifies the United States’ top male and female collegiate soccer players. The winner of the trophy was a sophomore from the University of Akron, so in essence, the award proclaimed Akpan as the best senior in the country.
“Andre was great to play next to during my first year,” rising sophomore Brian Rogers said. “He’s a good mentor, and he got us through a lot of tough games. He often came through in the clutch. He definitely led the team to a lot of our successes.”
After garnering so much praise and recognition during his collegiate career, there is no doubt that Akpan has the potential to be successful in the MLS.
It all starts with the opportunity he has with the Rapids, and what he does with it will be indicative of the type of attitude he’s demonstrated throughout his time at Harvard—determination, tenacity, and excellence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Hamilton Porter, the tubby, red-headed catcher from The Sandlot, entered into an insult competition with Phillips, captain of the crosstown rival team, some of the best verbal abuse in the history of sports movies ensued. The argument culminated with the ultimate low blow from Ham: “You play ball like a girl.” Ouch.
It’s common knowledge that men’s sports have been around longer than women’s sports, and in general, more people watch men’s sports compared to women’s. Not only are men’s teams attracting more fans, but they are also acquiring more money. Today, the average major league baseball player makes $3 million each year. A professional softball player is lucky to make $5,000 for a summer’s worth of work. Obviously, the markets for each sport are drastically different, but the better question is, why are audiences so much more captivated by men than women?
On Feb. 5, 2010, the Harvard men’s basketball team took on Princeton in front of a sold-out crowd, many of whom were students who had to lottery to get a ticket to the game. This happened several more times throughout the season, thanks to a group of students who marketed the games to the student body. The women’s basketball program never had students fighting to get tickets to its games. Furthermore, women’s basketball has won at least a share of 11 Ivy League championships in its history, including a devastating upset of No. 1 seed Stanford in the 1998 NCAA tournament. Men’s basketball has yet to win even one title. Not to mention that women’s basketball only became a varsity sport at Harvard 20 years after the men. So where’s the love for the women?
Don’t get me wrong; I’m guilty of watching male sports more often than female sports too. Every March Madness, I find myself completing the men’s bracket while just acknowledging the front-runners of the women’s pool. But as a graduating female athlete at Harvard, I look back on my four years and am dumbfounded as to why this phenomenon occurs on both a professional and collegiate level.
Even in The Crimson, the newspaper for which I write, we oftentimes see more focus put on men’s sports than women’s. I doubt this is ever on purpose. Simply put, the average person will think of men playing sports before women. In fact, at our beat draft two years ago (the time when each sportswriter can pick a sport they want to follow for the entire year), softball was the last sport picked, while baseball was secured in the first round.
I can’t help but wonder why there is such a difference in the wide world of sports fans. In 2007, the Harvard softball team struggled to get fans out to our games. It took the hosting of the first Ivy League Championship Series to really see some outside interest. The following year, the league decided to rework the softball and baseball schedules so both teams would play at home at the same time. This greatly benefited the softball team, as we were able to lure Harvard baseball fans—there seemed to always be an abundance of them—to glance over at our field and watch a few innings. That year, baseball had its worst record in program history, starting 2-22, while we would go on to our second straight appearance in the Ivy League Championship. Yet they still had more fans.
As they say, don’t hate the player, hate the game. I don’t hate men’s sports, but I do hate the game of gender appeal differences in sports. We’ve tried dozens of initiatives to change this point of view. Title IX. Establishing the WNBA. Putting the Women’s College World Series on ESPN. Still, the stigma lives on. Most people I have talked to have told me they had no idea what a fast-paced and exciting sport softball was until they saw a college game.
This makes me think that the real problem is a lack of awareness. Even though women’s sports are still catching up to the men’s, there is no mistaking the amount of talent and competition on the fields and courts. It’s something we should all take into consideration. So next time you are thinking about going to a Boston Red Sox game, maybe think about watching the Harvard softball team. It’s cheaper, guaranteed excitement, and you’ll leave wishing you “played ball like a girl.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all the success the Harvard softball team had in 2010, there were times in the March preseason slate where it seemed like nothing was going right.
Bats were failing to connect, pitching was occasionally mediocre, and opposing teams were overpowering the Crimson (27-23, 18-5 Ivy), sometimes by five or more runs. Thankfully for the team, this sluggish start to the season disappeared as conference play approached.
“I feel like the weekend we came home after spring break was the turning point in our season,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “I had a good team meeting that focused on some things we needed to make adjustments with. We then played Fairfield and won both games thanks to an outstanding offensive performance.”
The team started to get on the right track after opening the season with a meager 4-14 record. The two wins against nonconference opponent Fairfield sparked a winning streak that extended into conference play, with the Crimson taking the first two games of the Ivy season against Princeton—the first on the strength of sophomore Rachel Brown’s first career no-hitter.
But the next day, defending Ancient Eight champion Cornell quieted a Harvard offense that was finally coming together. After dropping the first contest, 8-4, the Crimson responded with a 7-6 win, splitting the series. What followed was a dominant sweep of Holy Cross and a commanding first game against Penn that Harvard won, 10-0, in early April. But the Quakers came back to narrowly escape the Crimson, 5-4, in the twinbill’s nightcap.
As the season progressed, Harvard took three of four against Brown and swept Yale by outscoring the Bulldogs, 27-7.
Heading into a home-and-away set with Dartmouth—a series that would determine who would finish at the top of the Ivy League North Division and earn a spot in the Ivy League Championship Series—the Crimson held a two-game lead over its division rival as it opened the series on May 1.
“I think in the morning, we were just really excited to be able to have this opportunity to clinch at home,” Brown said. “We were really energized, and from last year we knew that if we let down at all, they were going to take advantage of that.”
A lot was on the line, and Harvard stepped up to the challenge. The Crimson swept the Big Green not only at home to clinch its spot in the ILCS, but also in Hanover, N.H. the next day.
“Dartmouth is always a really tough opponent,” Brown said. “It was a really beautiful day, lots of fans came out, and it was awesome.”
After such a dominant display against the Big Green, Harvard was pitted against Cornell in the ILCS on May 7-8. The Big Red won the first game, 3-1, and seemed poised to take the second game as well, taking a 2-1 lead in the top of the eighth.
But in the bottom of the inning, with two batters already put away, Crimson sophomore Mari Zumbro sparked a rally with a single. Senior Jessica Pledger got on base as well, setting the stage for classmate Jennifer Francis.
With one swing, Francis pushed the series to a rubber match, blasting a three-run walk-off homer that gave Harvard a 4-2 win.
“Jennifer Francis’s clutch hit in the bottom of the eighth with two outs to extend our season, I think, was a great memory for everybody,” Allard said. “It was one of those wonderful moments in athletics and in competition that you just will savor.”
A third game on May 8 decided the ultimate victor, and Cornell defeated the Crimson by only a run, 3-2.
It also marked the end of a legacy left behind by six seniors: co-captains Margaux Black and Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, Stephanie Krysiak, Dana Roberts, Pledger, and Francis.
“Clearly, they were such a crucial class,” Brown said. “Even from freshman year, they were basically all starting. We’re going to have big shoes to fill. That’s really going to make everyone step up their games and compete for their spots.”
Harvard wrapped up the year by garnering a league-high nine All-Ivy nods, including three to the first team: Brown and sophomore first baseman Whitney Shaw, who were both unanimous selections, and junior second baseman Ellen Macadam.
After overcoming a slow start to the season and with a strong incoming class of freshmen, it seems like anything is possible for Crimson softball next year.
“We’ve got a lot of tenacity and fight,” Allard said. “I think we struggled a lot in the preseason this year, and it really forced us to learn how to be strong and get through tough situations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For almost all Harvard students, résumé-building requires constant effort. Men’s basketball co-captain Jeremy Lin makes it look easy.
To name a few of his honors: unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection, finalist for the Bob Cousy Award and the John R. Wooden Award—given to the best point guard and all-around player of the year, respectively—and 2010 Lou Henson All-American.
And that was just this year.
After receiving zero Division I scholarships following a standout high-school career, Lin rose to prominence as one of the few Asian-American players in college basketball throughout his first three years at Harvard. Gracing the top-10 player list of 10 different statistical categories within his conference last year—the only player in the NCAA to perform such a feat—Lin’s numerical prowess continued through to his senior year as his persona grew increasingly large in the national eye. The guard led all Ivy players in steals at 2.4 per game and also worked his way into the top 10  in scoring (16.4), field goal percentage (.519), assists (4.6), blocked shots (1.1), assist/turnover ratio (1.5), defensive rebounds (3.6), and minutes played.
Furthermore, Lin brings more to the court than any statistical categories can describe—namely in attitude. Starting all 29 games for the Crimson en route to a 21-8 finish and a third-place, 10-4 Ivy season, Lin proved to be an integral part of the best season in Harvard history. Regardless, the point guard remains unsatisfied.
“I had the goal going into the season to win an Ivy championship, and we didn’t do that,” Lin said. “So I don’t feel a huge sense of accomplishment or fulfillment...we all appreciate setting the record, but I think we fell short of our ultimate goal.”
Goals fulfilled or not, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker ranks Lin as the top talent to walk the court at Lavietes.
“The best player to ever play at Harvard. Period,” Amaker wrote in an email.
In the final year of his career playing at Lavietes, Lin’s triumphant efforts in games against Boston College (25 points), Boston University (19 points), and a triple-overtime victory against William and Mary (19 points) sparked high hopes for the Crimson as it entered its conference season and brought additional media attention from the likes of Time Magazine, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated, all concentrated on the humble Palo Alto, Calif. native.
Even when the rest of the Crimson struggled in the Ivy arena, Lin’s electric pace could rarely be stopped. In Harvard’s four Ivy losses to Princeton and Cornell—the first- and second-ranked scoring defenses in the Ivy League, respectively—Lin averaged 17.5 points and was held to single digits only once.
With his collegiate career behind him, Lin now looks to start anew in the NBA. After earning an invitation to the Portsmouth Invitational last month, Lin continues ongoing training in Las Vegas, Nev. in preparation for a professional career. Although impressive, it will take more than Lin’s résumé to boost him to the next level.
But though his future in the NBA is uncertain, Lin’s accomplished career and legacy as one of Harvard’s best is clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Rachel Brown took Ivy League softball by storm, breaking the Crimson single-season strikeout record and taking home Ivy Rookie of the Year honors in her first season at Harvard.
This year, Brown didn’t surprise anybody. She just got better.
The sophomore hurler sparkled in her second season in a Crimson uniform, leading her squad to a 17-3 regular-season Ivy record and a berth in the Ivy League Championship Series.
But along the way, Brown crossed off a few more career accomplishments as well.
On Apr. 2, Brown took the mound in Harvard’s Ivy opener at Princeton and immediately established herself and her team as the ones to chase in the Ivy League North.
The sophomore pitched her first career no-hitter—a game that would have been perfect had it not been for a sixth-inning fielding error behind her.
Never one to be satisfied, Brown repeated the feat eight days later at home against Columbia, once again allowing no hits and no walks while striking out 12 in the 3-0 win.
“The no-hitters...those are exciting,” she admitted. “I’m still hoping by the time I graduate to throw a perfect game.”
The no-no against the Lions came as part of a 71.1-inning stretch where the sophomore allowed just one earned run—good for a 0.10 ERA between Apr. 6 and May 1.
Unsurprisingly, that run coincided with the Crimson’s 11-game conference win streak to close the regular season. Brown collected wins in six of those contests.
“She had another outstanding year,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “As a freshman, she came in and needed to take off a lot of the [pressure] of [being] a freshman pitcher, and she did a good job. And this year she was even stronger...She was consistent and she developed more of her pitches.”
Brown’s bottom line—she went 17-6 with a 1.37 ERA, 233 strikeouts, and a .178 opponent average while pitching nearly half of the team’s innings—speaks for itself. She set new Crimson season benchmarks in opponent average and strikeouts and is currently the career leader in opponent average (.182) and strikeouts per seven innings pitched (10.08).
Unsurprisingly, Brown was unanimously selected to the All-Ivy First Team, her second straight nod. But for the sophomore, these personal accomplishments aren’t enough.
Though she led the Ivy League in ERA, opponent average, and strikeouts, Brown didn’t come away with the two prizes that have as of now eluded her—Ivy Pitcher of the Year honors and the Ancient Eight crown. Both of those went to Cornell’s Elizabeth Dalrymple, who pitched every inning of the ILCS to outduel Brown for both titles.
“Kind of like how the team played, I’m disappointed with the end of my season,” Brown said. “I’m always pushing myself to get better, and I’m just trying to do what I can for the team. The team’s great, and I really hope that the next two years, we can get Ivy League rings.”
With her goals in mind, expect Brown to keep getting better. After all, she could be the best Harvard has ever seen.

After three long years chasing a squash national title, co-captain Colin West became the 33rd Harvard player to claim the Pool Cup this season, emerging victorious at the CSA National Individual Championships this March.
“You get so few chances to play these top guys,” West said. “It all comes down to one tournament, and you really only get one shot.”
One shot was all it took for West, who persevered despite a busy schedule and tough competition. After winning four matches in two days, he defeated Princeton freshman Todd Harrity to claim the national title.
“I had my senior thesis due around the same time [as the tournament], so it was a pretty crazy time of year for me,” West said. “I started the tournament a little bit slow.”
“Some of my performances earlier in the tournament would not have won it for me in the end,” he continued. “When I really needed to step up and play well, I managed to do that.”
The match against Harrity, which took place at Yale, was highly contested toward the beginning, but West was able to pull through with two wins in the first two games, 11-9 and 13-11, respectively.
The third and final game in the Pool Cup championship match was not as close. West dominated Harrity, 11-1, cementing the Crimson co-captain’s perfect 5-0 record at the championships.
“Once I got to the tournament, I got very comfortable,” West said. “I ended up playing better than I had all year.“
One of West’s strongest competitors, two-time defending national champion Baset Chaudhry of Trinity, was not present at the competition. Chaudhry had handed West his only regular-season loss, though West won the duo’s first battle during preseason. Even without Chaudhry on the court, West faced grueling competition.
Despite the tremendous pressure of being the tournament’s No. 1 seed, West didn’t drop a single game on the road to the championship match.
“I was the top player going in,” West said. “But there’s a lot of pressure there, because you really haven’t played all of these guys before and you get one chance. It’s an elimination tournament, so if you lose, you’re done.”
West was honored on the CSA All-America First Team for the third consecutive time and was named first-team All-Ivy for the fourth straight year. The senior also earned the Skillman Award, which is annually awarded to a senior who “demonstrated outstanding sportsmanship during his entire college career.”
In four years, West amassed an impressive 50-9 overall record, but this season’s national championship surely stands at the head of all his accolades.
“It was sort of the capstone of the season, and the guys on the team are thrilled,” co-captain Frank Cohen said of West’s victory. “I know personally how hard he worked to get it, and I’m really happy he can finally see his work pay off in such a tangible way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems that the days of double-digit finishes may be over for the Harvard ski team—and no one is feeling any nostalgia.
The Crimson’s consistent ninth-place finishes may not have turned too many heads, but the team’s improvement and individuals’ flashes of brilliance have Harvard eager to hit the slopes again in 2011, when the seasoned freshman class will lead the charge once more.
“I thought it was pretty darn successful for both the men and the women,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said.
For both the alpine and Nordic squads, the women led the charge, posting historically high finishes on both sides. The team highlight of the season was when the women’s Nordic team took second in the classic event at the regional championships, led by junior Cara Sprague’s sixth-place finish.
“I think we opened a lot of eyes,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “That was extraordinary. We had a sense that we had the depth to ski with just about anybody in the league, and we happened to put it all together.”
The women’s alpine team put up some impressive finishes in regionals as well. Rookie Catherine Sheils, currently ranked in the top 10 among junior skiers, won the second run of the slalom event to take eighth place in the slalom overall—a finish Mitchell estimated to be the best by a Harvard alpine skier in the past 25-30 years.
“To win that second run is outstanding,” Mitchell said.
Both of the women’s teams posted consistent middle-of-the-pack finishes—the alpine team doing so while one of its top skiers, freshman Meg Luck, was frequently injured.
The efforts of the Nordic squad’s top four skiers—co-captain Audrey Mangan, Sprague, and freshmen Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy—allowed the Nordic team to make the leap from the middle to the top in the final classic race of the season.
Strong finishes from Sheils and sophomore Caroline McHugh, combined with a strong incoming recruiting class for next year, have the women’s alpine team optimistic for next season.
“It was an extremely, extremely successful season,” Mitchell said. “Everyone on the women’s side had their career-best result. When you have a year where everyone gets their best result, it was probably pretty successful.”
From a team perspective, the men did not have the same success as the women’s team did, but the men’s alpine team posted several strong individual finishes, including in the regional championships, when co-captain Chris Kinner placed in the top 30 in both the slalom and giant slalom events.
“I think we had two or three [finishers] in the top 30,” Mitchell said. “The men’s collegiate field is a little bit deeper than the women’s field. Putting two [finishers] in the top 30 is a first for us.”
But for both alpine teams, many of the best results did not appear in the scorebook. They came in exhibition races, such as the Sunday exhibition after the Williams Carnival, when Sheils took third in the region and sophomore Kevin McNamara took 22nd.
But more importantly, the Crimson’s potential for improvement has helped it attract stronger recruiting classes for all four squads.
“The better the team performs, it lends more credibility to the program for prospective students who want to pursue ski racing at a really high level,” Mitchell said. “We’re growing by leaps and bounds in terms of what we can offer the athletes.”
That freshman boost will help the men’s Nordic team continue to make strides next year. The men couldn’t match the strong finishes of the women’s team, consistently placing 10th and 11th. The freshman duo of Kevin Sprague and Anthony Ryerson showed promise throughout the season, and City expects them to lead the charge, along with a strong recruiting class, next winter.
“Tony skied at the Junior Olympics, represented New England, and really had some stellar results,” City said. “Both Kevin and Tony have good plans for training over the summer. They’re going to have good seasons.”
So while not all the squads were able to make the jump from the bottom of the pack to the middle, and the team as a whole stayed planted in ninth all season, the 2010 campaign gave reason for optimism across the board. Now that the team has achieved single-digit finishes, a surge to eighth and beyond doesn’t seem out of reach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When junior Cara Sprague left nearly all of New England in her wake with her sixth-place finish in the classic event of the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championships in February, she did more than post one of the strongest finishes in the history of Harvard skiing and lead her women’s Nordic team to a second-place finish.
The rising co-captain also capped off a season-long recovery from a collarbone injury that had kept her off the race course and out of commission all fall.
“This was the first time I’d been injured,” Sprague said. “It was pretty shocking.”
The injury kept the junior from conditioning all summer and fall—a major setback for an athlete competing in an endurance sport.
During the fall, Sprague was unable to participate in many of the team’s workouts or compete for the Harvard cross-country team, which she has done in years past. The two-sport athlete was limited to moderate training on her own.
“It was frustrating just because I wasn’t able to keep up with the team like I knew I was capable of,” she said. “I had to skip out on a lot of workouts. I was on my own for a lot of it, which was kind of daunting. It was very hard mentally.”
When her injury had finally healed by Christmas, the months without serious training had left Sprague out of shape, and she had to fit two seasons worth of conditioning into two months.
“I was really proud of how diligently she worked to come back,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “She just put her head down and went back to work. She trained really hard throughout December and January.”
Two months of work were not enough to prime Sprague for her first few races, and the team’s former top skier struggled to hit her stride in the season’s early competitions.
“I was kind of racing myself back into shape,” she said. “Trying to do that during the school year, while I had classes and homework, was hard.”
Though Sprague wasn’t posting her desired results, an outsider would have hardly noticed her struggles. The junior was consistently the Crimson’s fourth-best finisher, sitting just behind co-captain Audrey Mangan and freshmen Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy, who traded spots at the top.
Fueled by the quartet’s performance, the women’s Nordic team made the leap to a consistent middle-of-the-pack squad, knocking off regional powers such as Middlebury and the University of New Hampshire.
Sprague was putting up finishes in the top 40, even though she was only skiing a few kilometers of each race at her former strength.
“I really didn’t have a strong foundation,” Sprague said. “The races are so long that I’d have kilometers where I’d feel great, but I just didn’t have the endurance or the strength or the muscle memory for a 10- or 15-kilometer race.”
But when Sprague finally put together a complete race at the championship meet, few in the region could stop her. The junior was only 42 seconds off league leader Katie Bono and less than two seconds out of the top five.
“It just kind of fell into place at the right moment,” Sprague said.
“I couldn’t be prouder of the tenacity she showed,” City added.
Sprague’s finish wasn’t Harvard’s lone standout performance of the day. Kennedy and Tofte backed her up with 14th- and 19th-place finishes of their own, and the women’s Nordic team beat every team in the region, save powerhouse Dartmouth, in the classic event.
At the center of what was one of the team’s best-ever finishes, Sprague had done more than complete a comeback. She had emerged better than she was prior to her injury, moving up 16 places from her finish at regionals the previous year to stake her place as one of the top skiers in the EISA—an accomplishment that is especially impressive given that the Crimson is already disadvantaged by its lack of snow relative to most of its competitors.
Now healthy again and able to train, Sprague has the potential to emerge as one of the dominant skiers in the region next winter. Given how she responded to her first major injury, one shouldn’t bet against her.

Despite a promising start, Harvard field hockey struggled through its fall season, finishing 5-12 for the year and 2-5 against Ivy League opponents.
For the fifth consecutive year, the Crimson finished with a sub-.500 season. The team’s last winning record came in 2004.
But the win-loss totals are not completely representative of the fall. Of Harvard’s 12 defeats, seven were by two goals or less. Two of those were one-goal overtime losses to New Hampshire and Columbia at the end of the season.
Still, though the Crimson kept many games competitive, it struggled throughout the second half of the season.
After opening the year with three consecutive wins, the Crimson managed only two after Sept. 12.
Harvard ended the season on a five-game losing streak, part of a 1-8 slide.
“[This} season was a tough season,” said junior and rising co-captain KJ Warren. “We had a young team, and there was a lot of learning and growth that needed to go on, but we actually progressed in a way that we were very proud of.”
Crimson coach Sue Caples also pointed out that her squad dealt with injuries throughout the course of the year.
“Not only did we have a small team, but we had a few players out with season-ending injuries,” she said. “Then we went through the whole swine flu, which wiped out our team, so a lot of players had really great playing experience.”
One of the season’s most notable games came against Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. on Oct. 17. Harvard, which entered the contest having lost seven of its last eight, shut out the Big Red—one of the leaders in the Ivy League at the time—in a 1-0 victory. A second-half goal from co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon accounted for the game’s only offense.
“It was one of those games where everything seemed to click—everything that we had been working on in practice, forward movement, [and] constant communication throughout the field,” Warren said. “It just all seemed to work together.”
Caples viewed the game as one of the on-field highlights of the season as well.
“We had, I think, our best game,” she said. “It was really a great team win, and everybody executed the game plan, and it worked.”
The win over Cornell was the last of the season for the Crimson. Three of its five losses to close the year came against Ivy League competition, including a 9-0 defeat to eventual champion Princeton a week after the upset victory over the Big Red.
Junior Chloe Keating was the team’s most prolific scorer for the year, netting 10 goals in her 17 starts.
Three Harvard players scored five goals of their own to tie for second on the team, but the Crimson never scored more than four goals in a single game during the fall.
Co-captain Kristin Bannon and sophomore rising co-captain Carly Dickson shared the team lead in assists with seven.
Despite its difficult finish, Harvard holds high hopes for next season.
Caples noted that eight rising freshmen will join the team in the fall.
“There will be competition for positions,” she said. “It will really make a difference on how we keep players healthy [and] how we’re able to press.”
Warren shared this optimism for the upcoming season, and like her coach, she praised the incoming freshman class and the role she expects them to play.
But she said that Harvard’s spring season will also be a factor heading into the 2010 campaign.
“I think we did a great job as a whole team this spring just going after it and working as hard as we can and improving as much as we can,” Warren said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team has experienced mixed results throughout this season. While one of its A-division boats may come away from a regatta pleased with its performance, its B-division counterpart may be somewhat disappointed with its less-than-impressive finish. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the women’s and co-ed squads find themselves in rather different positions and with fairly different mindsets entering the closing weeks of their seasons.
The women’s squad will compete in its final regatta of the spring, the Inter-collegiate Sailing Association Women’s National Championship held today and tomorrow in Madison, Wisc., after finding success throughout the regular season.
“The season has gone really well for us,” co-captain Liz Powers said. “While we had our fair share of challenges at the beginning of the year, we have followed a rigorous training regimen over the last few months that has allowed us to be consistent in finishing well at all of our regattas.”
Despite its small roster of only four sailors, the women’s team has been able to finish among the top five in the majority of its significant regattas. Powers, along with sophomores Emily Lambert, Marie Appel, and Alexandra Jumper—all four of whom were selected for the All-New England Team—now find themselves ranked fourth in the country entering the final competition of the year.
“The goal entering the national championships is always to win,” Powers said. “We have been training with Boston College, who is ranked No. 1 in the nation, over the past week, so we feel if both our A- and B-division boats sail well, we can compete with anyone.”
On the other hand, for a team that is used to finding success on both the regional and national levels, the fact that the Harvard co-ed squad, after somewhat of a mediocre regular season, was only able to qualify for one of two national championship regattas has come as somewhat of a disappointment for the team.
Although it will travel to Madison next week to close out its season at the ICSA/Gill Dinghy National Championship from June 1-3, the co-ed squad finds itself not as busy as usual during this time of year.
“We were able to qualify for the fleet-racing national championship, which is always a goal of ours,” junior co-captain Alan Palmer said. “It was a little disappointing that we were not able to make the team race national championship regatta, but if we had to choose between the fleet- and team-racing contests, we would always choose the fleet-racing contest. It is a bigger affair and one which we focus on throughout the season.”
Entering the national competition with the goal of improving upon its 10th-place efforts of the past two years, the Crimson co-eds finally hope to be able to put everything together for the first time all season.
“We have been pretty up-and-down with the regattas we have competed in throughout the year,” Palmer said. “Both divisions have not been able to finish well on the same weekend yet, or we haven’t been able to sail well for two whole days of competition. Therefore, while we are definitely content with how our season has gone, we have not exceeded our expectations.”
This marginal lack of success throughout the year is not dampening the co-ed squad’s goals entering its final regatta of the season.
“We are hoping to finally have that breakthrough performance at the national championship regatta. We think we can come away with a top-five finish if things go right for us,” Palmer said.
The Harvard co-eds also hope to finish well at the national competition in order to build off a strong performance heading into next year.
“We only lose two people to graduation,” Palmer said. “While there are not as many seniors as usual throughout our entire conference right now, I think we will not be hurt by graduation as much as other teams, because all three of our top skippers return next year.”
Meanwhile, although the women’s team loses its team leader in Powers next year, the squad plans to welcome two skipper recruits to the roster next season to go along with this season’s three second-year contributors.
“Outside of me graduating, we have a young team,” Powers said, “So I think we will be able to continue our success next year.”
So while the women’s and co-ed squads enter the championship portion of their respective seasons with different goals, they both hope to find themselves atop the New England and national collegiate sailing scenes next year. Perhaps for the first time in a while, the two teams’ results will match up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Caroline Vloka faced rival Rebecca Ward in the fencing NCAA finals, she was not thinking about a title. Having lost to Ward in the championship sabre bout last season, 15-4, Vloka was simply hoping for a better showing.
Instead, she left the competition as a national champion.
“When I started out the season, I wasn’t going in with any expectations,” the sophomore co-captain said. “But always, in the back of my mind, I remembered the loss last year.”
After taking a summer off from intense training, Vloka took second place at the NCAA Northeast Regionals and earned the silver medal at the Garret Penn State Open.
She led her team to a 15-8 record and a final No. 9 national ranking.
Despite having a sophomore regular season that was, on paper, less successful than her rookie year, Vloka entered the NCAA Championships, held in Cambridge, with a finals appearance in mind—hoping for one that resulted in more than four points.
When Duke’s Ward qualified for the title bout, more than a medal was at stake. Vloka’s 15-13 victory over Ward was less about a championship and more about a comeback, a long-awaited victory over a decade-long rival.
“It didn’t set in until a week later that I actually finally beat her,” Vloka said. “Every time I think about it, I have such an emotional reaction. Everyone knows how much this win means to me.”
Teammate Karl Harmenberg is one who knows how much the victory meant.
“It’s a destiny story,”  the men’s co-captain said. “She won the championship bout at home against a girl she’s never beaten. If anyone would do it, it would be Caroline.”
Vloka entered the final day of NCAA competition in fifth and earned 19 wins to capture the title.
In addition to her national title, the sophomore was also named to the All-American and All-Ivy League First Teams for the second year running.
Vloka’s success this year, particularly in the postseason, is due to a different, more relaxed attitude, complemented by an unchanging competitive, confident spirit.
“Caroline is very confident on the strip,” sophomore teammate Valentin Staller said. “Whether she’s competing against a weak fencer or an Olympic medalist, she gives it her best.”
“She’s a great fencer physically, tactically, and mentally,” Harmenberg added. “She can handle the pressure.”
With two years left in her career at Harvard, Vloka will likely continue her success as a captain and competitor.
“I would love to be in the finals for the next two years,” the champion said. “Hopefully I can stay at the top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams, it was supposed to be a rebuilding year. After ending the season with a fifth-place finish in the NCAA tournament and a national title winner, it was clear that the Crimson far exceeded expectations.
“This year, we had a relatively new team,” said sabre national champion Caroline Vloka. “We lost a lot of good people last year, but the freshmen really picked it up.”
Between the two teams, 19 of the 29 fencers were either freshmen or sophomores.
Despite the relative inexperience of a young squad, the Crimson fencers were able to overcome the odds and capture a No. 6 and No. 9 national ranking on the men’s and women’s sides, respectively, at season’s end.
The women, who had just come off of an Ivy League championship last year, had a season of both brilliant and disappointing performances, culminating in a grand finale at NCAAs. The Harvard women opened the season with a bang at the Harvard Invitational—earning two medals through the efforts of sophomore co-captains Vloka and Noam Mills—and proceeded to plow forward with a seven-match win streak, taking down defending national champion Penn State and the dominant forces of North Carolina, NYU, and Princeton.
But following this powerful start, the Crimson lost momentum, falling in five consecutive matches at the St. John’s Invitational. The remainder of the season followed this high and low trend, resulting in a formidable 3-0 performance at the Beanpot followed by a fourth-place finish at the Ivy League conference tournament.
“The women’s team had their ups and downs,” sophomore Valentin Staller said. “They definitely had a chance to do something in the Ivy League...but lost a few very close bouts.”
The women concluded the Ivy League Championships with a 3-3 record, defeating Brown in all weapons but falling to Columbia and Princeton. Mills, Vloka, and sophomore Shelby MacLeod garnered spots on the All-Ivy League First Team, led by Mills’ strong showing in the épée.
After earning the maximum amount of qualifiers at NCAA Regionals, the women finished fifth at the NCAA Championships, held at Gordon Track. The highlight of the two-day final was the crowning of Vloka as the national champion in the sabre after she defeated longtime rival Rebecca Ward of Duke.
Although the men cannot boast a national-title winner, they can claim a 14-7 record, two members of the All-American team and five of the All-Ivy squad.
“It was definitely a rebuilding year,”  Staller said, “but we really showed that we could beat some of the best teams.”
Staller won the silver medal at the Garret Penn State Open, and teammates sophomore James Hawrot and freshman Thomas Kolasa captured fifth in their respective weapons. In the Ivy League Championships, the men finished tied for second place after defeating Yale, Brown, and Columbia and falling to Penn and Princeton. Staller and freshman Ben White earned first-team All-Ivy honors while Kolasa, Hawrot, and co-captain Karl Harmenberg were named to the second team.
During the NCAA Championships, Staller finished sixth in the sabre, good enough for a spot on the All-American Second Team. Freshman Tommasso di Robilant placed 12th in the foil, and Hawrot and Harmenberg finished 14th and 16th in the épée, respectively.
One of the brilliant moments for both teams was their performance at the NCAA Northeast Regionals, where Harvard qualified the maximum number of fencers (12) to compete at the NCAA Championships.
“Both teams did extremely well in the postseason,” Staller said. “We qualified the maximum number of fencers, which only four other teams were able to do.”
For a team with few expectations at the beginning of the season, the end certainly brought promising results.
“We recognized that we had a lot of freshmen and sophomores,” Harmenberg said, “but the underclassmen really showed up and always came out strong.”
“This year has given us so much to build off of for next season,” Staller added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a still-filling Yale Bowl, the Harvard football team was in trouble. Though it had come into the 126th playing of The Game as the heavy favorite—boasting a 5-1 Ivy record and an outside chance at a share of the conference title—the Crimson had gotten off to a sluggish start in the first quarter and found itself staring at the wrong end of a 10-0 score.
The Bulldogs, trying to salvage a disappointing season in front of their home crowd, got on the scoreboard on their first two drives. Alex Barnes’ 26-yard field goal made it 3-0 after six minutes of play, and after junior quarterback Collier Winters coughed up the ball at the Yale 43-yard line, the Bulldogs marched to the endzone, where Rodney Reynolds capped the drive with his first career touchdown.
As the game wore on, nothing was going right for Harvard. It reached the red zone twice in the first half, only to turn the ball over on downs—once on an incomplete pass and once on a trick field goal gone wrong.
“We got outcoached in the first half, no question about it,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy admitted after the game. “[Yale] did a great job. We made some adjustments at halftime, had a little bit of a character check.”
The tides started to turn for Harvard at the start of the third quarter. The Crimson finally got its formidable run game going, with Winters, junior Gino Gordon, and freshman Treavor Scales rushing for a combined 71 yards on the half’s opening drive. But on the one rush that really counted, Gordon was ruled down inches shy of the goal line—even though video replay showed the ball crossing the plane.
“The first spark, even though we came away with zero, was just the great drive,” Murphy said. “We came out, we really executed a great drive at the beginning of the second half...We just had to finish. And in the end, we finally did.”
With the stadium now full, it was Yale’s turn to falter. The Bulldogs’ only trip across midfield in the second half resulted in a missed 27-yard field goal. The door was open for Harvard—it was just a matter of taking advantage.
Just over seven minutes remained in the game when Murphy decided to take another gamble. The Crimson was looking at fourth and four at its own 30-yard line, and if a comeback was going to happen, time was running out.
So rather than putting the punt unit on the field, Murphy left his offense out there, and Winters handed the ball to Gordon.
The junior tailback cut up the left side, spun out of a tackle, and found open grass. He made it past the first-down marker and kept running, carrying the ball to the Harvard 49. And just like that, the Crimson was in control.
“Collier correctly checked to the draw play, and it looked like it was throttled out,” Murphy said. “Just kind of bounced outside, and all of a sudden we had new life.”
Winters hit sophomore Adam Chrissis for a first down, and on the next play, Winters launched a 41-yard pass to senior Matt Luft in the endzone.
“He was running a dig route, he just saw the safety byline and just took it up,” Winters said after the game. “I saw the same thing, just threw it up to him, got it in the endzone. That just set us off.”
Yale took the biggest gamble of the game on the next drive, calling for a fake punt play on fourth and 22 that was stopped seven yards shy of a first down. With the ball back on the Bulldog 40, it took just 53 seconds for Harvard to take the lead for good.
A quick pass to Luft and a two-yard rush from Gordon brought the ball to the 32, and another bomb from the hand of Winters—this one to junior Chris Lorditch—put the Crimson up, 14-10.
“It was crazy, playing at Yale,” sophomore Matt Hanson said. “The whole game we had this down feeling like we couldn’t get anything going, and then just coming back like that was ridiculous.”
Senior Jon Takamura sealed the win with an interception, and though the Harvard seniors didn’t get their third Ivy title, they did get the satisfaction of leaving the field with a third consecutive big-Game victory.
“It’s still setting in,” captain Carl Ehrlich said after the triumph. “Ending the year with a win, especially in that fashion—it’s unbelievable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 traded in his crimson-colored jersey for the green and white of the New York Jets, the 6’5” Ivy Player of the Year quarterback certainly left some big shoes to fill on the Harvard football team.
Enter junior Collier Winters, an inexperienced dual-threat quarterback who, listed generously at 5’11”, appeared to differ from Pizzotti in just about every way imaginable.
Yet the expectations for the heir to the reins of the Crimson offense remained the same.
“With Chris going on to play in the NFL, there were certainly high expectations for me,” Winters said. “The biggest expectation was definitely getting some wins.”
“Even though [Winters] didn’t have a lot of experience, he put himself in a very good position as far as the learning process goes,” added senior running back Cheng Ho. “It was just a matter of him getting his shot.”
And though the signal-caller from Tulsa may lack the size and the pocket presence of his predecessor, Winters flourished in his first year as the starter, leading the Crimson (7-3, 6-1 Ivy) to a second-place finish in the Ancient Eight and more importantly, perhaps, a thrilling come-from-behind 14-10 victory in The Game.
“Collier has a disadvantage as far as size goes, but he makes up for it by studying the opponent very well,” Ho said. “He really studies the ins and outs of the defensive schemes, and he’s just a competitor.”
Individually, he passed for over 1,800 yards and 15 touchdowns, led the Ivy League in pass efficiency, and averaged a league-high 11.9 yards per completion, good enough to earn second-team All-Ivy honors. On the ground, Winters rushed for 295 yards and three touchdowns, tied for the second-most of any quarterback in the Ancient Eight.
“I wasn’t expected to sit back in the pocket and just throw it 30 to 40 times a game [like Pizzotti],” Winters said. “But Coach [Tim] Murphy tweaked the offense to let me get out of the pocket, run a little bit, and do some zone reads.”
While the coaching staff had confidence in his ability to fill up the stat sheet, Winters worked hard the entire season to master the intangibles attached with the quarterback position.
“From the first game to the last game, I’ve learned how to become more comfortable managing the game and being in the pocket and making the right throws and right reads,” Winters said.
“I think that as a quarterback, you have to fit into that role where you need to be that leader and be that personality,” he added. “To be a great team, a good quarterback needs to earn that respect [from] his teammates, give them confidence, and be able to score points and win games.”
In his first game as a starter, Winters completed 22 of 37 passes for 195 yards against Holy Cross. And though the game ended in a loss for the Crimson, Winters recounts the experience as one that gave him the confidence necessary to lead his teammates on the gridiron for the rest of the season.
“Being able to go out and get the first game underneath my belt, I definitely showed my teammates that I can play at that position,” Winters said.
With newfound leadership, Winters followed up his debut performance with an even more impressive showing against Brown the following week. In a 24-21 victory, Winters earned Ivy Offensive Player of the Week honors by completing 18 of 27 passes for 223 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for a game-high 66 yards and one touchdown.
But like every Crimson quarterback, Winters will be most remembered for his performance in The Game.
After three quarters of dismal offensive play, the field general came up big when it mattered most, throwing two perfectly-placed touchdown passes over the top of the Yale secondary to senior Matt Luft and junior Chris Lorditch. His clutch play in the dwindling minutes of the fourth quarter gave the Crimson its third straight victory over the Bulldogs.
“To be in that type of situation where we had to come back like that made my first experience at the Yale Bowl even more special,” Winters said.
While many expect Winters to be penciled in as the starter for next season, he is facing heated competition from junior Andrew Hatch, the transfer who started several games for LSU before returning to Cambridge last spring.
Like a veteran quarterback, Winters remains unfazed by the challenges facing him in the offseason.
“Andrew’s a great quarterback,” Winters said. “I’m looking at it as a chance to push myself to get better. Without him, there wouldn’t be much pressure or competition...I’m just looking forward to this summer and getting ready for the next season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lindsey M. Parker ’10 likes views of bright city lights. Early in his career at the College, he and then-girlfriend Stephanie J. Brinton ’10 spent nights together running his favorite city trail through the streets of Cambridge, along the Charles, and then onto a spot just beyond the B.U. Bridge, where the bright view of Boston arose before the jogging couple.
So when he decided that Brinton should become his wife, he proposed to her during a hike one winter evening  at Ensign Peak, a foothill overloooking a snow-covered Salt Lake City. It was the spot where, years before, Brinton’s father had proposed to her mother.
“I knew I wanted to marry her from the moment I first saw her,” Parker said, laughing as he added, “It took her a little while longer to come to that conclusion.”  “The first thing I said was ‘Are you serious?’”
Brinton remembered of her husband’s proposal, “Not because I didn’t think he was serious, but because I was so happy that I couldn’t believe it was happening then. He had been so calm throughout the evening that I didn’t even think anything was up. It was a wonderful surprise, and he proposed just how I dreamed of.”
According to a close friend of the couple, Robert C. Parker ’10, “Stephanie and Lindsey were the first to be engaged in our circle of friends. From the beginning, they set an exemplary example with regards to way that they treat each other.”
Parker and Brinton were married in Salt Lake City on Aug. 7, 2009 in what friends described as a small, intimate, and “reverent” ceremony, with roughly 50 people present.
The groom recalled the days surrounding his marriage as filled with “a lot of talking and a lot of smiles.”
Married undergraduates are few and far between at Harvard, and Parker noted that life as a married couple in such an environment can be difficult. Both originally Leverett House residents, Parker said he and Brinton were required to move to nearby Peabody Terrace in order to live together.
Still, he said, the pros of married life far outweigh the cons. “Our friends have been very supportive, very happy for us. Plus, it’s fun interacting with them as a married couple,” he said.
According to Brinton, “There are so many wonderful things about married life, but I think the best would have to be that Lindsey inspires me to be a better person. Whenever I’m around him, or even when I’m not, I want to be better, kinder, and work harder because I want to be that kind of person for him. And I know that he’s doing the same for me.”
As for the future, Parker said he foresees having a family “with a couple of kids. I’ll have my law degree and Stephanie will have a nutrition degree. We’ll be happily married, even more in love with each other than now and—hopefully—still going on runs with each other.”

Alexander J. Ahmed ’10 and Rebecca J. Morton no longer remember the first time they met, but there’s no shortage of early recollections.
She remembers her friend having a crush on him in middle school. He remembers her in a few of his classes freshman year of high school. Growing up in East Long Meadow, Mass., the two attended school together beginning in kindergarten, but did not begin dating until their senior year of high school, after Morton took the lead in asking Ahmed to a movie. The two continued dating through college, even though they were separated by several state lines and a four-and-a-half hour bus ride.
Throughout that time, those early recollections were joined by new memories. “The last four-and-a-half years have been full of moments when I knew that he was the one for me,” Morton said.
The couple got engaged this past December.
Upon graduating high school, Ahmed and Morton went their separate ways—Ahmed to Harvard and Morton to the University of Maine. Morton said that the two would see each other about twice per month, traveling by a bus that ran conveniently from South Station to the University of Maine campus. “For all the business we gave them, Concord Trailways should thank us,” Morton laughed.
In December, Ahmed popped the question, journeying to Maine with a bottle of wine the two had bought at an Ohio winery on a summer road trip with the intention of saving it for a special occasion. Collaborating with Morton’s roommates, he set up the wine and two glasses on a table in her apartment while she was at work and put their song on and a suit.
When Morton entered the apartment, she said she knew exactly what was going on. “He had a speech, but I didn’t hear any of it because I was freaking out,” she said. Ahmed similarly described her reaction. “She jumped on me and made it very difficult for me to say what I had planned to say,” he said.
Morton said that even though the engagement was anticipated by both families, they were still very excited. “His grandmother started screaming into the phone,” she said.
Though they have not yet set a date for the wedding, Morton and Ahmed said that they would like to have it sometime next summer in their western Massachusetts hometown.
The two plan to live in Boston after graduation. Morton will be attending graduate school at Simmons College for library science and working as a library technician at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Jamaica Plain. Ahmed, currently a resident of Kirkland House and an Applied Mathematics concentrator, is considering working in a math-related job or teaching. He said that after four years, he looks forward to being back in the same place as Morton.
“I’m happy that we made it through four years of long distance, and being close again will be really great for us,” he said. “I’m excited to spend the rest of my life with her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Elizabeth A. Cook ’10 organized a movie night for the Harvard Undergraduate Fellowship, a Christian student organization, she was hoping that fellow member Samuel D. Stuntz ’10 would attend. Not only did he show up, he was the only person who did.
So the pair watched “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” alone. They later realized that the film was one of the few movies that Cook, an anime aficionado, and Stuntz, an aspiring screeenwriter and Quentin Tarantino admirer, could both appreciate.
Cook and Stuntz began to date shortly thereafter, in February of their freshman year. They grew close after discovering that they shared a favorite childhood radio program, “Adventures in Odyssey.” “Sam went to Radio Shack to purchase a tape player to listen to old cassettes of the show,” Cook said. “I knew then he must like me.”
Friend Moonlit M. Wang ’10 characterized Cook and Stuntz as the ideal couple. “When we play Cranium, we always separate them into different groups because when they are in the same group, they get each other as if they have telepathic powers,” she said.
Though they had broached the subject of marriage earlier in their relationship, it was not until the beginning of their senior year that Stuntz proposed.
“It wasn’t out of the blue, but I had to wait until she finished the GREs,” Stuntz said. “I waited until the day after.”
Stuntz created a list of reasons why he wanted to marry Cook—one reason for each month that they had been dating, as the couple celebrates each “monthiversary.” After reading reason number three, Stuntz asked Cook to marry him. She said “yes,” and then waited a few days before telling Stuntz that he had miscounted the number of months they had been together.
“I do think they are a perfect match, because Liz is a very strong woman, and he lets her be that,” said Cook’s sister, Catherine D. Cook ’12. “Instead of her taking his last name, they are both changing their last names.”
The couple will be married at Christ the King Church in Central Square on May 30. After their wedding, they will serve as proctors for the Harvard Summer School until Cook, an applied math concentrator, starts the Business Economics Ph.D. program at Harvard Business School in the fall.
“We joke that we’re getting married and then adopting twenty high school-aged kids,” Cook said. “But we figured this would be easier than finding an apartment on top of thesis, grad school, and marriage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rachel Esplin Odell ’10 came very close to missing her own engagement.
It was reading period of her junior year at Harvard, and Rachel had three papers due in succession. She stayed up all night completing a 25-page essay, raced to turn it in, and sped off to the airport to fly to Washington, D.C. to visit her boyfriend, Georgetown student and Utah native Scott Odell.
She missed the flight.
Luckily, she got a seat on the next plane and arrived in Washington, where her boyfriend took her on a tour of the White House—and then proposed to her in the Rose Garden.
The couple met in the summer of 2008 at a Church of Latter Day Saints event in the capital, where Rachel had an internship and Scott was taking summer classes. They started dating soon afterward, and about a year later, they were married at the Mormon Temple in Idaho Falls, Rachel’s hometown.
“It was a beautiful day, just perfect,” Rachel recalled. “We believe that if we’re married in the temple, we’ll be together forever, not just ‘til death do us part.’”
They spent their honeymoon in Thailand, then continued on to China, where Rachel completed research for her thesis on China’s involvement in the World Trade Organization and Scott worked for a nonprofit firm.
Scott took a semester off from Georgetown to live in Boston with Rachel while she completed her final semester at Harvard. “We didn’t want to do the long-distance thing anymore when we were married,” Rachel says. Since she had taken five classes in the second semester of her freshman year, Rachel was able to arrange her schedule so that she could graduate in December of her senior year.
“Now, looking back on it, it was fortunate that it all worked out. I personally feel that it was a great blessing,” she said. “It made it work out for our marriage. I feel it was kind of providence guiding my path.”
Since Rachel’s graduation, the couple has been living in Washington. Scott is finishing his junior year at Georgetown—though he is older than Rachel, he took time off from college to serve a Mormon mission in Mississippi—while Rachel translates research papers from Chinese to English and works as a research assistant to a Chinese studies professor at Georgetown. Next year, she will hold a one-year fellowship with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Rachel also says she was lucky to experience engagement and marriage at the same time as one of her close friends. Her roommate Stephanie Brinton ’10 got engaged within two weeks of Rachel, and the roommates’ weddings were just two weeks apart.
“It was nice to have someone to go through the whole wedding planning process with,” Rachel said

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
María Carla Chicuén ’10 and Antonio may have grown up just blocks away in Havana, Cuba, but it took a Harvard invention to bring them together.
“We found each through Facebook,” Chicuén said, referring to the social networking website that began in a Harvard dorm room. “All of the sudden we started chatting. It was finals period here, but during the summer, we started writing to each other, and the writing got to the level of five to six pages a day.”
They spent time as pen pals first, but before they reconnected face-to-face, Antonio—who requested that his last name not be printed—wrote that he knew there was something special about the woman writing back.
“My first memory of Maria Carla is actually a memory of her voice, when, after spending months writing to each other, she called me from Italy,” he wrote in an e-mail from Cuba, where he lives now. “I will never forget that moment.”
Last summer, Chicuén traveled to Cuba to do research for her history thesis about the island nation’s diplomatic relations with Spain and Great Britain. Antonio was there to meet her at the airport.
They spent a lot of the next weeks together. Chicuén and Antonio had known each other a bit when they were kids—before Chicuén immigrated to Miami—but they had lost touch. Now, they made up for lost time.
Antonio, a few years older, was pursuing a master’s degree in digital systems at the Polytechnic University José Antonio Echeverría in Havana. But he still found time to help Chicuén with her thesis research. And, of course, they found time to spend together.
Their first date came just a few days after Chicuén arrived. The pair strolled down el Malecón, a historic and picturesque esplanade along the Havana coast. Next came dinner at a restaurant with an ocean view. And then they danced the night away. “That first date confirmed that we were meant to be together. We just enjoyed each other so much, and the mere presence of the other was enough to feel happy,” Antonio wrote.
One day later that summer, they hiked together to the top of the tallest mountain in Cuba. When they arrived back in Havana, Antonio proposed—a moment the groom-to-be described as “completely spontaneous, between smiles and tears.”
At the end of the summer, Chicuén traveled back to Cambridge to start senior year, but she’s returned to Cuba every month since to see her fiancé. And with the fortuitous change of Harvard’s calendar, she got to spend a full month in Havana with Antonio as she completed work on her thesis.
The two said they are still finalizing plans for next year and have not yet set a date for the wedding.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was an afternoon and evening that Liza Pope would later remember as a “beautiful romantic fairytale.” There was the carriage tour of Paris, a horse-drawn circuit from the base of the Eiffel Tower and back again. There were the gardens, and the roses—a field full of them. There was nightfall in the city of love, a gazebo, and a view. There was a poem read and a tear very nearly shed.
The possibility of a proposal was not absent from her mind, Pope said. Friends had wondered whether the Parisian visit might not make a fine occasion for her boyfriend of nearly six years, Michael P. Silvestri ’10, to pose the question. But in the midst of a magical night, she urged herself to stay grounded. “He asked me to sit on his knee and he can’t get on one knee if I’m sitting on his knee, so there’s no way he’s going to propose,” she thought.
And then it happened. The ring—quietly purchased months earlier and stashed in a sock drawer in Switzerland during a summer-long internship—was produced from inside a camera case. On one knee after all, Silvestri made his proposal. The answer? “Absolutely.”
The couple is to be married on July 10 in Wellesley, Mass., half a world away from the garden where the engagement began, but only minutes from the town of Natick, where Silvestri and Pope met for the first time, as freshmen in high school. The first date was the following year—a group trip to go see a movie. He offered to pay for her ticket, she held his hand.
“The thing is, you’re going out with somebody before you have a driver’s license,” Silvestri recalled. “Our first quote-unquote dates were our folks driving us to each other’s houses.”
College brought a lucky arrangement for the high-school sweethearts when, after pursuing the application process independently, Silvestri was admitted to Harvard, where he would complete an economics degree and row for the lightweight varsity crew team, and Pope to Boston University, giving the couple a valuable proximity that Pope credits with helping her and her fiancée stay involved in each other’s communities.
Following the wedding, Silvestri plans to make a few visits to South Africa as he helps to establish a tutoring program there and to develop water purification technology in a continuation of a project begun with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ David Edwards. Much of the work for both projects will be conducted from Boston, where he and Pope will be living. Silvestri will begin work at Oliver Wyman next January. Pope will work with her Christian ministry at Boston University before entering the Teach For America corps.
The response to the impending union has been positive, said Silvestri, who called Pope’s parents while she was on a plane, already en route to Paris, to ask their permission.
“I think naturally it’s surprising to people that two 22-year-olds are getting married right after college because a lot of people are thinking about where they’re going to go professionally after graduation, so I basically tell them that that stuff is still there,” Silvestri said of the feedback from friends. “This isn’t the end to our lives—we just want to unite them and go through the rest of them together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael J. Gaffney ’08-’10 said he “thought it was code” when Jenny C. Carloss ’07 asked him to come over for a study session the night before their American Presidency exam in January 2007.  “I brought a movie,” he explained.
But Carloss had other plans. “I had all the reading down on the floor. Mike used to be a Senate page in high school—he knew all this stuff...It was definitely all about trying to get as much info out of him as possible,” she laughed as the pair spoke of their earliest dating experiences.
So when Carloss asked Gaffney to a 10 p.m. cup of coffee at Café Pamplona a few weeks later, “I just sprinted downstairs,” Gaffney says of his tardy arrival, adding that he didn’t realize it was a date until he saw Carloss dressed up waiting for him. “I’m like, ‘Oh shit,’” he laughed.
Gaffney and Carloss will be married on July 10.
Sparks first flew between the Mather House residents during the Fall 2006 semester, when they took American Presidency together. Gaffney’s courses were scheduled such that he missed lunch every day the class met.
“I told him, there’s this great program—you can mail in your lunch order, and you pick it up. He would never do it and would continue to complain,” Carloss said. “So I put in an order for him and showed up to class with lunch for him. That’s sort of where it began.”
After Carloss graduated, she moved to Washington D.C. to work for a healthcare consulting firm. Gaffney began to work on the Obama campaign in the capital, and ended up taking a year and a half off—instead of the planned semester—to stay with it, returning to Cambridge to finish up his last two semesters at the College after the inauguration.
Gaffney proposed to Carloss during a hike in the Shenandoah Mountains late last April. They were talking about taking a trip around the world together, but they knew they were going to want a bigger wedding, Gaffney said, so they decided the extended travels would have to wait until after they were married. “Jenny said it would be years away,” he said. “I proposed right then.”
They plan to have the wedding this summer in Gaffney’s home state of Vermont and will honeymoon in Sardinia, Italy before returning to Washington D.C., where Carloss remains in healthcare consulting and Gaffney works as a political consultant.
“Mike is definitely every girl’s dream for a groom,” Carloss said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First Class Marshal Nworah B. Ayogu ’10 grabbed the microphone. Before a crowd of more than 1000 at the Senior Soirée last Saturday, he announced the 3-hour-old engagement of Michael Y. Wu ’10 and Y. Jenny Cao ’10. The crowd erupted into cheers and applause.
Caught completely off-guard by the announcement, Cao described her reaction. “I was so grateful that we have so many amazing, supportive friends,” she said. “It reminded me of how special everyone here is and how much I will miss Harvard when I leave.”
Wu echoed her sentiments, saying, “I didn’t expect the cheering to be so loud. It really touched my heart. We have a really great class.”
Wu and Cao’s relationship stretches back to freshman year, when the two were introduced by a mutual friend, Geoffrey L. Oberhofer ’10, who was Wu’s bunkmate and one of the first people Cao met at prefrosh weekend.
Though Cao remembers their first meeting vividly—“I remember because he was wearing this collared shirt with a flower pattern, so I thought he was a little weird”—Wu’s memory is a bit hazier. “I remember seeing her in Annenberg, but I may or may not remember the first time I met her,” he said.
But Wu does remember their first date: a trip to the ice cream shop on March 22, 2007. “We went to Herrell’s and ended up talking for a long time,” he said. “I was thinking, ‘I don’t know if I will be able to impress this girl.’ I didn’t know if I could get a girl like her, but I tried it anyway.”
The night of the Soirée, the two went to Top of the Hub for dinner, and for dessert, the two had the chef’s special crème brulée. The dessert was in what Cao described as a “duck bowl thing,” and when she opened it, she found the engagement ring. The top diamond was the first diamond Wu’s father gave his mother.
“I got teary-eyed,” Cao said. “I was really touched; I was really happy, deeply content.”
Though no definite plans have been set for the wedding, Cao and Wu said they plan to get married in one or two years at a chapel in Hawaii, Wu’s native state.
Next year, the two will move into an apartment on the waterfront in Boston. Wu, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator and current Winthrop resident, will be working in healthcare consulting, and Cao, an Economics concentrator in Leverett, will be in corporate strategy for Capital One. Wu said he is looking forward to starting their life together. “She is my best friend and the person I am comfortable and happy to spend the rest of my life with,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the day after graduation marks a new stage in the lives of each member of the Class of 2010, May 28 represents an even more momentous occasion for Billy M.K. Stallings ’10 and his fiancé Paul G. Nauert ’09. Trading a gown and mortarboard for a tuxedo, Stallings will head to Memorial Church on Friday to tie the knot with Nauert.
“We want to make this covenant in front of all our friends and family,” said Stallings, adding that it is important to the couple to marry at Harvard because of the emotional value the campus holds for them.
The pair was immediately drawn to one other when they met in the fall of 2008, but they didn’t get together until Stallings’ 21st birthday party the following spring. Stallings proposed four months later, driving with Nauert from his San Antonio home to the Austin capitol building, where he popped the question as the stars came out.
“There was a huge rainbow in the sky the whole time we were driving,” said Nauert, who accepted the proposal immediately.
After their Cambridge wedding, the newlyweds will road-trip back to Texas and move into their new home in Austin along with their newly adopted puppy, Athena.
“The city is radically different from where I grew up,” said the St. Louis-born Nauert, who plans to work on the couple’s garden and possibly engage in community organizing or other projects in Austin.
“We’ll see how it unfolds,” Nauert said. “I’m ready to suck the marrow out of life in Austin.”
In the meantime, the couple has been busy finalizing the plans for the wedding. The ceremony will feature a series of readings that will emphasize love, commitment, and how marriage brings families together.
“It’s about the public love and the courage that queer people have—the courage that any couple has whose love becomes public,” Nauert said.
Stallings’ father, an ordained priest in the Progressive Catholic Church, will officiate the ceremony.
Though Stallings and Nauert will obtain their marriage license in Massachusetts, the state of Texas does not recognize same-sex marriage.
“I’m sure there’s no way that will continue,” said Stallings, who will attend law school at the University of Texas in the fall. “Something will have to change, but fortunately we’re both into constitutional law, so we’ll do our best to navigate our rights until then.”
Nauert said that even the fact that he is right-handed and Stallings left-handed proves the strength of their connection.
“We can sit next to each other and not bump into each other,” he said, smiling at Stallings. “I look at Billy and I see my beloved, the person I’m going to spend the rest of my life with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hillel Nadler ’10-’11 sat at the piano. As his hands moved back and forth across the keys, he began to sing Sam Cooke’s 1957 love song “You Send Me.” When he came to the lyric, “Now I find myself wanting to marry you and take you home,” he turned expectantly to his then-girlfriend Tova S. Weiner Nadler ’10. She looked quizzically back at him.
“She hadn’t really figured it out yet,” Hillel said. “So then I added ‘Tova, Will you marry me?’ a number of times. She turned to me and she said ‘For real?’ And I said yes. And then she said yes.”
Tova and Hillel were married January 17, 2010, in Los Angeles.
The two met their freshman year at Harvard Hillel. Though they were friendly, they did not begin dating until winter break of Tova’s junior year—Hillel’s sophomore year, as he had taken time off to study abroad. They both say that the other’s commitment to Judaism was one of the things that drew them to one another.
Tova said Hillel proved that sense of commitement extended beyond religion early in their relationship. A former computer science teaching fellow, she recalled complaining to Hillel over Google chat one day that no one ever came to her scheduled office hours. He suddenly signed off and was in her office within minutes, stayed with her until the end, and walked her home.
“The first thing I would say is that he is really sensitive and caring and good at helping me through whatever I am dealing with,” she said. “He is really supportive and caring and a really committed, loyal person.”
Hillel spoke of Tova’s personality as one of her most attractive qualities.
“As anyone who knows her will attest, she is full of joy and happiness and very outgoing and happy and engaging,” he said. He added jokingly, “She is really smart, too and helped me with my CS homework.”
By August, Hillel was ready to pop the question. He and Tova were scheduled to be in Toronto, Hillel’s hometown, for a mutual family friend’s wedding. Before Tova arrived, Hillel and his sister scouted out places downtown to ask her, eventually finding a music store he liked. After Tova came accepted his proposal, they went outside to be greeted by his flower-laden sisters. The engagement party was the following Saturday.
“His mom had been baking things all week for the party,” Tova said. “I thought she just liked to bake.”
The two were married in a traditional Jewish ceremony at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City. Tova said that many of their mutual friends flew out from Harvard to attend.
“It was very surreal for both of us,” Hillel said. “A lot of friends from Harvard and from Hillel came. It was great to celebrate it with them.”
Next year, Tova will be working as a software engineer at Google in Cambridge while Hillel finishes up his senior year.

New Orleans native Cristina Ortiz ’10 and Richard Carapezza of Salt Lake City may hail from different parts of the country, but it was clear that the two regulars at the Cambridge Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints had more than religion in common.
“I thought she was cute, so I sat down next to her [at church], and we started talking afterwards,” said Carapezza, a student at the Berklee College of Music at the time. “I found out she was a [New Orleans] Saints fan, and I’m actually a Saints fan, and so we just hit it off.”
They talked on and off for the next couple years, and in the fall of 2008, Carapezza asked her out on what would be their first date of many—to the Boston Beer Works restaurant, followed by ice cream at J.P. Licks.
“We had such a great time,” recalled Ortiz. “I knew it would be something long-term.”
After Carapezza graduated in December 2008, he moved back to Utah—thousands of miles away from Cambridge, where Ortiz was still a junior.
But when he returned east to start a master’s degree in psychology at New York University, the relationship, now newly unfettered by continental distance, grew more serious.
By that fall, the two had started talking about marriage. Carapezza said he had a friend in the jewelry business who helped him find the ring, but even with forewarning, the timing of the proposal still came as a surprise to Ortiz. She was visiting Carapezza in New York for Valentine’s Day weekend earlier this year, and the two of them took the ferry out to Staten Island, where he pulled out the ring to propose.
“I was pretty shocked,” Ortiz remembered. “We had talked about marriage before, but I wasn’t expecting it then!”
Just a couple weeks after the economics concentrator and Leverett House resident gets her Harvard diploma, she and Carapezza will wed in Louisiana—not far from where the Saints play, as it happens.
Next year, they plan to live in New York City, where Ortiz plans to find a job doing public policy work and where Carapezza will finish his degree at NYU.

Samuel J. Haynor sat to the side of the raised amphitheater in Radcliffe Yard surrounded by a small circle of friends. It was about 1 p.m., and they were rushing to stuff envelopes with blank cards and small slips of paper.
"To your teacher..." read the 1,200 slips of paper that needed to be placed under just as many chairs by 3 p.m.
Haynor, a 2010 graduate from the Harvard Graduate School of Education's International Education Policy Program, was one of the student speakers for the school's Class Day ceremony yesterday.
While his speech had been planned for about a month, at 4 a.m. yesterday—less than 12 hours before he had to give the speech—he decided to rewrite it.
"That moment was a month ago," Haynor said about his original speech, which he had submitted to the University about a month prior. He said wanted to capture the current moment. This moment would involve 1,200 cards.
Underneath each seat of the amphitheater, Haynor and his friends and family diligently placed a stuffed envelope, complete with stationery and instructions.
"1. Write a letter on card to any teacher in life" was the first step.
It was Haynor's one request: show love to a previous teacher.
"Love is knowledge," Haynor said. "The only way you can love something is to know it."
His audience was then instructed either to fill out the envelope with a known teacher's address or to "write facts that will help us reach them" on the reverse of the slip of paper. Letters placed in the "impromptu 'mailbox' in front of Gutman Library sometime between now and Friday afternoon" will be stamped and delivered to the teachers, by mail, or any means possible, according to the paper distributed to the audience.
At the end of the ceremony, a man stopped Haynor to give him his addressed card. It would be the first of many.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every season must come to an end. Holly Cao’s arrived yesterday afternoon.
The Harvard sophomore met her match in the first round of the NCAA Division I Women’s Tennis Singles Championship at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga.
73rd-ranked Cao, the sole Ivy League representative in the field of 64, fell to 13th-ranked Maria Mosolova in three sets.
“I thought Holly competed really well,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “It’s an honor to be representing the Ivy League in the NCAAs, and she did a great job….Holly really matched Maria stroke for stroke from the baseline, and she really competed well.”
Mosolova, a Northwestern junior who is looking to gain All-American status for the third time in as many years, took initial control of the match with a 6-3 first set.
But Cao, the top-ranked player in the Northeast region, regrouped and came back strong in the second to take a 2-1 lead. She continued on to win the set, 6-1.
“I think I played pretty well in the second set,” Cao said. “I was more consistent, and I was being more aggressive.”
But Mosolova would not be denied her 22nd singles victory this spring, taking the decisive third set, 6-2.
“I just didn’t pull it out in the third,” Cao said. “I didn’t play as well as I would have liked.”
Cao’s first-team All-Ivy season ended with a 15-4 record in dual matches before yesterday’s loss, including a 5-2 mark in Ivy League contests. She is now 22-7 in spring singles matches in her collegiate career.
The top Harvard player’s loss to Mosolova was her first individual NCAA Championship appearance, which continues a nine-year streak of a Crimson woman earning a bid to the individual tournament. Previously, Harvard was represented by Beier Ko ’09 (2007-2009), Eva Wang ’06 (2006), Courtney Bergman ’05 (2003-2005), and Susanna Lingman ’05 (2002).
“I feel honored to represent Harvard at the national championships,” Cao said. “I really want to come back to this tournament for the next two years.”
“She’s excited about working hard to get back here next year,” Green added. “It was a great experience for her, and she’s definitely looking to build on that for next year.”
Mosolova, who was the preseason’s top-ranked player, now has seven career victories in the NCAA Championships.
“She is a very good player,” Cao said. “She has a very consistent backhand.”
Mosolova advances to play North Carolina’s Katrina Tsang this afternoon.

For many new coaches, the first few years are meant for imposing new order and making sure players don’t feel too secure in their spots. When Jamie Clark took over the already successful Harvard men’s soccer program, he took the opposite approach, showing confidence in his players’ abilities.
“He makes you feel really comfortable,” freshman Brian Rogers said. “He’s not one of those coaches who thinks it’s all about him. He puts the players first.”
Clark’s inclusiveness has helped new freshmen mesh well with their upperclassman teammates.
“I don’t think any player goes a day without talking to him,” co-captain Brian Grimm said. “He incorporates everyone, whether it’s a No. 1 player or a reserve.”
“It’s the personal effort that makes him a great coach,” senior Desmond Mitchell added. “He’s making it a whole true Harvard soccer family.”
According to Mitchell, that personal effort has extended beyond the team to include alumni. Clark’s personality has also helped attract top recruits, such as Rogers, who can fit in with the team and make an immediate impact.
“He recruits good people as well as good players,” Grimm said.
At the heart of Clark’s chemistry-building abilities is his genuine love of the game. The 21st pick in the 1999 MLS Draft has been known to join in and play with his athletes, demonstrating what to do in a given situation.
“I think it’s always easier for players to see a clear picture of what I want, so when I can provide this, I do,” Clark wrote in an email.
That kind of atmosphere helped the Crimson stay loose in a tight race for the Ivy title. When Harvard’s six-game winning streak was snapped by Wake Forest, the Crimson didn’t miss a beat in its following games, when the team tied Cornell and rallied to knock off then-No. 15 Brown. And when an upset loss to Princeton threatened to dismantle the team’s Ivy title hopes, Harvard responded by going undefeated for the rest of the regular season to capture the crown. Throughout the year, the Crimson athletes played with confidence, speed, and teamwork, demonstrating on the field the kind of chemistry Clark had helped to build in practice.
“He doesn’t put a lot of pressure on you,” Rogers said. “He doesn’t yell at you or embarrass you. He’s just a ton of fun to play for.”
“The goal is to allow the players to express themselves, show their talent, and overall not detract from what they have the ability to do,” Clark wrote. “Understanding this, my goal was to add a little structure and keep confidence high.”
Had a positive attitude and emphasis on fun been Clark’s only attributes as a coach, the team would not have done nearly as well. But Clark’s spirited style was accompanied by a thorough knowledge of the game and a knack for in-game management.
“He has the eye to be able to make small changes to ensure we have success at the end of the day,” Mitchell said.
“The players did their part in building confidence by winning games,” Clark wrote. “This let me just make an occasional tactical adjustment and keep motivation/standard high.”
Like his ability to create team chemistry, Clark’s penchant for making influential game-time decisions stems from his love of soccer and dedication to studying it.
“He is very good at making decisions on the fly, whether it’s changing around players or changing formations,” Grimm said.
Clark was rewarded for his efforts when Harvard won the Ivy title, earned the 10th seed in the NCAA tournament, and made it to the Sweet 16 this past fall—his second season at the helm. For the coach, the success was a case of déjà vu.
Two years before, he had guided Notre Dame to the 10th seed in the NCAA tournament in his second season there. When Clark left for the Crimson, he took a slight step back in his first season, leading Harvard to the second round of the NCAA tournament. But for the Crimson, the season represented a step up, as the team had only made it to the first round the year before.
And the team’s final ranking doesn’t even tell the whole story. When Harvard took on then-No. 3 Wake Forest, it held the Demon Deacons to a 1-0 victory in a contest where the host team was only able to register three more shots than the Crimson. Harvard was also only outshot by three in its final loss of the season to Maryland. In both contests, Clark guided Harvard to play beyond its ranking. He had trust in his players’ abilities, and they gave him reason to believe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Ten years ago, the last Harvard graduating class of the 20th century faced what seemed to be an optimistic future, premised on what was then a prosperous and conflict-free world order. Not only was the Cold War long past, but also the European Union was flourishing as the emblem of post-nationalist global cooperation, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had launched an international coalition to bring order to the Balkans. To be sure, Americans and other innocent people had lost lives to terrorism, but it was far from America’s shores. At home, the Internet was fueling explosive stock growth, and steady increases in home prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average created confidence that predictable prosperity lay on the horizon.
This year’s graduating class looks at a different prospect. The illusion of a peaceful post-Cold War world has been shattered. While Iraq is perhaps headed to a relatively stable and democratic future, we currently must continue to shoulder the majority of the burden of the conflict in Afghanistan as NATO’s contribution dwindles. Radical Islamist terrorism has cost thousands of American lives and is gestating in ungoverned territories in South Asia, Yemen, Somalia, and North Africa. A bellicose Iran is approaching the nuclear threshold. Pirates range across the Indian Ocean. Across our own southern border, the Mexican government is struggling with sophisticated organized crime cartels over the control of significant portions of northern Mexico—a struggle that could spill into the United States.
This breakdown in global security has been accompanied by an even more dramatic reversal of global economic fortunes. In early 2000, the dot-com bubble burst. More significantly, the rise in asset values that supported much global prosperity turned out to be an illusion largely fueled by easy credit; when the bubble burst, highly leveraged speculative positions reversed gear, and the international financial system came uncomfortably close to crashing. Even more troubling, the ongoing Greek debt crisis has suggested that weaknesses in sovereign debt may trigger another, even more profound global financial meltdown.
Looking back, the past decade appears as a succession of collisions between the optimism of 2000 and brutal reality. If there is a consistent theme to the past 10 years, it is that we have consistently underestimated the likelihood and impact of negative, high-consequence events. The assumption that a past run of peace and prosperity is assured for the future has led us to confuse wishful thinking with disciplined planning and preparation.
For graduates of 2010, the future will require a new, more tough-minded way of thinking for every professional discipline.
International relations: Global security can no longer be preserved through focus on nation-states alone. The spectrum of transnational threats, from terrorists to international drug cartels, must be an additional subject of national-security focus. The traditional tools of war fighting and statecraft must be blended with the skills of development, policing, cultural studies, and institution building.
Business and economics: The free market is still the foundation of prosperity, but the rules of the road have to change to align benefits and costs with decision-making. We have felt the consequences of bankers leveraging other people’s money on speculative bets or politicians dispensing favors using debt that will be saddled on the next generation. The new architecture of business and political economy will have to assure that those who gamble must bear their own losses, and that public spending does not distribute benefits today while postponing burdens until the next generation.
Law: Modern technology and the Internet have delivered enormous capability into the hands of institutions and individuals around the globe. However, our dependence on this network carries the seeds of great vulnerability. Protecting our assets and the security of our transactions in cyberspace is not only a technical challenge, but also a legal challenge. What are the legal responsibilities of institutions and even countries for securing global cyberspace against "rogue" threats arising within their own domains? What are the rules and laws of cyber warfare? What is the new legal construct for privacy in an age when so much of our lives are lived through the Internet, and the capacity to store and disseminate this data is almost without limit? The technology to address these issues can only be intelligently developed if we have a legal superstructure within which it will be operated.
Public health: Globalization is a public-health hazard. While the recent H1N1 pandemic was non-lethal, there is a disturbing likelihood that either a natural, fatal pandemic will occur or a biological weapon will be unleashed in the near future; global travel and trade patterns make it virtually impossible to cabin such outbreaks. Our public-health models and institutions are not geared to prepare for such a catastrophic health emergency—and yet, such an emergency is becoming more likely. Part of the answer will be research and technology, but much of the outcome will depend upon planning and preparation, which must engage not only the medical and public-health communities but also the whole gamut of public and private institutions.
In the end, the class of 2010 does not face a more threatening world than did the class of 2000; the threats are simply more apparent. But with all of this comes an unusual opportunity for this graduating class to shape the globe at a point of inflection.
