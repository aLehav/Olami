After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Environmental rhetoric is riddled with fluffy promises about green jobs, green economies, and green governments. These issues may seem simply nebulous and unimportant concepts. Yet the Massachusetts state government is now poised to lead its constituents towards a true green economy.
Students for a Just and Stable Future, a political advocacy group on campus, lobbied to create the first environmental caucus—the Green Economy Caucus—in the Massachusetts State Legislature last year. The purpose of the caucus is to “promote legislation and policy that encourage economic growth and job creation based on sustainable development aimed at improving economic, environmental and social well-being.” This caucus, a victory for SJSF, represents student involvement in the government and the commitment of politicians to act on climate change mitigation. The first Caucus meeting was on February 13, and represents an historic achievement for Massachusetts legislators. The meeting was an enormous success, with about 50 legislators and aides present, and lends hope for future political processes.
The United Nations Environment Programme defines a green economy as “improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.” According to Mihir Chaudhary ’12, leader of SJSF, the “Green Economy Caucus represents the first cohesive political attempt to develop a 'transition' to a post-carbon economy. We do not know what that economy will look like, but this is where the true potential of this legislative forum works.”
So, why does anyone care about a green economy? Climate change has an undeniable impact on our way of life. Everyone has heard the statistics: The Northeast has warmed half a degree Fahrenheit per decade since 1970. The numbers of days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Massachusetts is expected to increase from between five and 20 days to between 30 and 60 days. Ocean temperatures in the Northeast  Atlantic are expected to increase up to eight degrees Fahrenheit due to climate change. These numbers seem abstract, but the realities they represent pose a significant threat to agriculture, fishing industries, tourism, health, and communities—the foundations of our economy.
For example, agriculture—a $94 million per year industry in Massachusetts—will see decreased yields due to higher summer temperatures. This means crop failure and increased pests and weeds. Marine species will move further north to colder waters, jeopardizing the coastal fishing industry. Skiing and snowmobiling industries will be severely affected by decreasing snowfall and shorter seasons. Residents with asthma will face greater risks as air quality worsens. Mosquitoes will become more widespread, acting as vectors for diseases. The list goes on.
This may seem like a hopeless situation, but it is not. The challenges facing society and individuals are also opportunities for change. Humanity has the tools to maintain a high-quality of life and live within ecological limits. Climate change is not an unsolvable issue. Individuals are taking action around the world to decrease their carbon footprint and live in an environmentally and socially just way.  Of equal importance is government’s ability to create meaningful legislation that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels and develop viable alternatives. The Green Economy Caucus is an example of this kind of progress. Hopefully it will serve as a model for other states.
Ideally, the Caucus will develop its own legislation and vote on policies as a bloc. Members will become educated on the importance of a green economy and promote legislation that will advance technological and economic progress. For example, there is already a bill in the state legislature to phase-out coal in Massachusetts by 2015. Frank Smizik and James Eldridge, the co-chairs of the Caucus, are also working to increase usage of green technology 25 percent above 2010 levels by 2020.
These bills, focusing on truly stopping climate change, are a result of the type of coalitions that the Green Energy Caucus will strengthen. Alli Welton ’15, another SJSF member, notes that “people often get the sense that the environmental movement opposes the interests of business and labor—but this Caucus will show that it doesn't have to be this way.”
The Massachusetts Legislature is active and impassioned. The Green Economy Caucus, founded as a result of student advocacy, will increase the Legislature’s impact by bringing together people from all sectors—health, labor, economic, and environmental—and uniting them in a common interest. This is political change in the making.

“Shit people say” is an extraordinarily broad category. It covers everything from your perpetually profound comments about the weather, to the obnoxious thing that kid said in section, to Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. Sometimes even the greatest sayers of things get tired of saying things; Hamlet must “like a whore unpack my heart with words,” and even accounting for the Prince’s taste for melodrama, it still can seem like we talk too much but say too little. The ability to have your voice be “heard” has expanded exponentially, as if hundreds of millions of people were given free megaphones. Sometimes this is an enriching thing, as when we hear the voices of protestors struggling to speak freely. Other times, it can be debilitating; there is something vaguely depressing about measuring out our lives in status updates. Either way, it’s distracting, making it difficult to hear our own voice. But that’s ok, because we have funny videos to tell us what we say and how we talk to each other. Right?
“Shit Girls Say” was created by Graydon Sheppard and Kyle Humphrey and posted to YouTube about a month ago, and has been viewed over 13 million times. But even these numbers belie its productivity, the way in which it has become a platform or, dare I say, an inspiration, for a whole bevy of spinoffs and amendments. But there is something about the spontaneity of their generation that should give us pause. Eventually, no matter who we are, we will find ourselves parodied and see our own repetitions revealed. Behind the laughter lies the terrifying possibility that if we could redact ourselves, we would sound the same as the people in the videos. Protected by a way of listening and speaking that treats every expression as an unedited rough draft, we pleasurably drown in an illusion of difference when we all pretty much say the same thing, over and over again. In his experimental novel “A,” Andy Warhol showed that if you tape-record human speech, the transcript is gibberish, snowed under by “uums” and “uhs” and punctuated with “you knows.” “Shit people say” makes the opposite argument: Underneath it all is a contiguous and seamless structure of pre-fabricated phrases that are instantly intelligible; they show us ourselves, a revelation predicated on reifying categories that we talk our way into all the time.
The success of the “shit people say” meme is telling because it illustrates both the peril and potential of a new way of speaking and hearing. Debates about how different groups use language reveals what creates a shared language by illustrating how it can be simultaneously regionalized and made intelligible; its dialect is conveyed in the lingua franca. But it also reinforces the ways in which our language is never entirely our own. Unknowingly, we share words and phrases and ways of thinking in common. We rent, rather than own, the words that we speak. No words are loaned out to more people than curse words. They are so interesting because they are both overloaded with meaning and entirely evacuated of it. By describing the content of speech as “shit,” we immediately devaluate it and, more importantly, efface the potential for differentiation. But the totalizing reductionism of the meme is not entirely generated by the s-word. “Thing” would serve just as well to remind us just how unoriginal we can be—space-fillers rather than meaning-makers.
The overwhelming response to “shit people say” is recognition, identification, and validation; it makes us laugh because it seems true. But I don’t think that’s right. It doesn’t do justice to the nuanced, textured conversations I hear in the dining hall all the time, nor to the passion and insights I am privy to in more academic settings. If we are going to be prosaic and banal (and we are, a lot of time), let us at least own that vulgarity and coin our own content. In a world of texts, emails, and Tweets, we have so many opportunities to be eloquent, funny, sexy, and scandalous. Seize them, and say shit that’s not ours, or theirs, or mine, but yours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Where do sexual assaults happen on campus? It turns out this question is difficult to answer because the University is selective about what information it makes public.
Harvard is obligated by law to release certain statistics. According to the Clery Act of 1990, universities that receive federal funding are required to release a certain amount of information about the crimes that occur on their campuses. This takes the form of an annual security report, crime logs, and timely warnings. The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, currently in Congress, would increase this requirement by making colleges release domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking statistics along with sexual assaults in annual reports.
Beyond this, however, the University is mostly quiet about sexual assault on campus. When the group Students for Safe Space, who campaigned last year for sexual assault statistics to be made public, asked the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to release the data they had about the percentage of reported assaults that took place in final clubs, they were told no after a series of exchanges.  This answer came about not simply on account of reliability of statistics, but because administrators had expressed concerns about how the release of such statistics might distract from the underlying issues of sexual assault. There was a statistical concern, a student involved told me: The University did not have precise enough data to bring forward. But the administration rejected the idea that they might solve the statistical problem by collecting more data and releasing it publicly.
In all follow-up correspondence on the question of data, the University has pleaded lack of information. When I asked about the data for a previous piece on final clubs, I was told that precise breakdown of data beyond the number of assaults that occurred on and off-campus was incomplete and therefore unusable. When I mentioned the experience of Students for Safe Space, I received a long press statement from Jeff Neal, publicist for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, about how much Harvard cares about assault and how little it knows about the circumstances (reprinted in part below).
“Harvard cares deeply about the safety and well-being of our students, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR) offers support and assistance to all students who come to us for help.
“While we do collect some information about the location of the incidents that are reported to OSAPR, that information is incomplete and thus cannot provide an accurate picture of any campus trends.
“Indeed, sexual assaults happen everywhere—on campus, off campus, and when students travel.  Statistics from recent years indicate that assaults occur on and off campus at a generally similar rate, although, according to our data, the risk is significantly increased in locations where alcohol is present in high quantities, and assaults are often linked to alcohol consumption...It is important for students to understand the kinds of risks that are posed in the college environment and at OSAPR we urge all members of our community to stay vigilant and to look out for each other so that we as a community can work together to reduce these risks.”
Even within this disavowal of data, it seems that the University knows more than it lets on. While Neal said that the information collected by OSAPR, which is culled “directly” from individuals who reach out to the office, “is incomplete and thus cannot provide an accurate picture of any campus trends,” it has been sufficient for the school to draw conclusions. For one, Harvard seems to have a general sense of where assaults occur: “Statistics from recent years indicate that assaults occur on and off campus at a generally similar rate.” And the University has drawn inferences about what this supposedly trendless data indicates: “According to our data, the risk is significantly increased in locations where alcohol is present in high quantities, and assaults are often linked to alcohol consumption.” Such assumptions about the circumstances accompanying sexual assault could not be made unless the University was consciously accumulating data about the nature of assaults on campus.
The University does provide many resources for Harvard students—a 24-hour hotline and support are undoubtedly necessary at a college where, according to national statistics, up to one in five women may become victims of sexual assault. But the University cannot maximally protect the safety of its students so long as it is selective about what information to withhold and what to make public. A complete preventative program must include data about where assaults occur as part of a full picture of assault on campus—one that would give students a complete understanding of campus safety. The University states, “the mission of OSAPR is to promote the compassionate and just treatment of student survivors, their friends, and significant others and to foster collaborative relationships between campus and community systems and affect attitudinal and behavioral changes on campus as we work toward the elimination of sexual violence against all people.” This mission cannot be fully realized until the University gives each student crucial information about the circumstances under which assault happens. Harvard should collect and release any information about sexual assault that will help students equip themselves against it.

One thing’s for sure—Occupy Lamont Library isn’t hurting anybody. Since Sunday, a handful of GSAS, Divinity  School, and College students have “occupied” the library, setting up what they call “a persistent community space for critical thought” in Lamont Café. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with a group of Harvard affiliates having a conversation in a social space like Lamont. In fact, we see no problem in their staying as long as they would like, considering the innocuous nature of their gathering. Yet, we can’t help but notice that for all its laudable methodology, the occupation seems empty of substance.
Let’s face it: Nobody has trouble grappling with the metaphysics of the library. To listen to the rhetoric of Occupy Lamont, one would think the Harvard library system were in some sort of existential crisis. (To liquidate the collection or not to liquidate?) One would expect to see students stumbling blindly into bookshelves, deliriously confused about the nature of “knowledge creation” at Harvard. Yet, as most Harvard students and faculty can attest, the task of “transforming a collection of books into a thriving space for cultivating knowledge” at this university has been quite successful. Further arguments about the deleterious effects of “neoliberal imperatives” and the “profit imperatives” on Harvard libraries makes us wonder whether Occupy Lamont is not engaged in some kind exercise in fiction. Regardless of whether Harvard can be classified as “neoliberal” (a vague term to say the least), it certainly is not a for-profit institution. Far from being driven by profit motives, Harvard’s library system is merely attempting to get up to speed with advances in technology and digital research while remaining financially sound.
The fact of the matter is that much of Occupy Lamont’s rhetoric about communal knowledge creation and community space is really only transparent window dressing for the occupation’s true motive: to protest the likely layoffs of library employees. We agree that layoffs are regrettable, and should be handled with the utmost care, but they are an inevitable economic necessity. It is just bizarre to wrap up the issue in a post-modern ramble that detracts from the actual conversation. Occupy Lamont would be a more worthwhile contributor to the community if it instead adopted the strategy of the Student Labor Action Movement, which addresses issues of labor forthrightly.
Furthermore, considering Occupy Harvard’s earlier demand that Harvard be a “University for the 99 percent, not a corporation for the one percent” it is surprising that this latest incarnation of the protest movement would be so opposed to increasing student employment. But this cuts to the heart of the matter: Occupy Harvard is in denial about the existence of trade-offs. They want more money to low-income students, and more jobs for staff. They call for better “knowledge creation,” but shudder at the sight of advancements that require fewer employees. They want more money from the endowment, but reduced incentives to attract qualified endowment managers.
Again, we welcome Occupy Lamont to go about their business. But a discussion of the kind that they claim to be interested in having ought not distract from the issue at hand. As a community, we do not need to re-imagine the fundamental properties of the library. There is no impetus to do so, and Harvard’s librarians, led by University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60, have been working not only on modernizing our system but also making Harvard’s material accessible for free online. Occupy Lamont distracts and potentially impinges on this real progress, and stands in the way of a frank discussion about layoffs.

When the Harvard football team takes the field next fall to defend its Ivy League title, it will do so with the aid of five new coaches. To fill the positions left by Tony Reno and three other former assistant coaches who followed him to Yale, Harvard head coach Tim Murphy first hired Ryan Crawford to lead the defensive backfield and Jeremy Bandy to coach the offensive line.
Murphy also promoted Michael Horan to coach the defensive line and hired Ron DiGravio to fill Horan’s former post of defensive line coaching assistant. Most recently, Murphy brought in Chris Batti to serve as the running backs’ coaching assistant.
Crawford, who served as defensive coordinator for the University of Rhode Island last year, was not on Murphy’s radar at the beginning of the search process but ended up proving to be a very strong candidate, Murphy said.
“We got a lot of recommendations about him, and when we met him, we were very, very impressed,” Murphy said. “With his resume, experience and his interview, he was by far the most impressive candidate for the position.”
Crawford’s background will also help him during recruiting season. The new special teams coordinator is from North Carolina and will be responsible for scouring the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida for potential talent.
“He’s familiar with that part of the country, so that was one more thing that made him a very solid candidate for the position,” Murphy said.
Murphy was already familiar with Bandy, who had previously served as offensive line coach at Holy Cross, the only team to best Harvard in 2011.
“Seeing his offensive line up-close on film many times led us to believe that he would be a great candidate,” Murphy said.
Murphy knew even more about Horan, who served his third year for the Crimson last season.
“Mike is a guy we’ve had a long time to get to know,” Murphy said. “By virtue of his experience and the outstanding job he’s done, that was an easy decision. We got a ton of resumes, a ton of phone calls, but at the end of the day, Mike was too good of an internal candidate to pass up.”
All three coaches will fill large roles on the staff, but they will have fewer responsibilities than the pair of new coaching assistants, who, in addition to game-planning, are responsible for video work, computer work, and other small jobs.
“You want someone who wants a great work ethic, certainly someone who is articulate and polished, but someone who is going to roll up the sleeve and work very hard,” Murphy said.

Peace in Afghanistan may be best achieved by involving a coalition of major world powers as well as the nation’s geographic neighbors, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay M. Khalilzad said Thursday at a lecture organized by Harvard’s South Asia Initiative.
Khalilzad, who also served as the Bush administration’s ambassador to Afghanistan following the initial expulsion of the Taliban, advocated formulating a peace plan that took into account not only domestic conditions, but also the larger geopolitical problems plaguing the region.
He likened the relationship between Afghanistan and its neighbors to the power struggles that plagued Europe during the 19th century.
“I have felt at times that this is like old Europe—people feel that in the weaknesses of their neighbor, there are opportunities,” Khalilzad said.
In particular, Khalilzad emphasized the importance of working with Pakistan in order to ensure a long-term peace by preventing a return of the Taliban to the region.
“Without Pakistani support...it will be very difficult to get a complete peace process,” he said.
Khalilzad was also frank on the subject of past U.S. policy missteps, referring to his own involvement in a controversial policy of arming the mujahideen, a group of militant Afghanis, during their insurrection against the Soviet occupation in the 1980s.
“It was interesting to see that Ambassador Khalilzad has recognized the mistake the U.S. has made in the 1980s in funding the mujahideen,” said Dan Orbach, a graduate student in the history department who attended the lecture.
In light of these controversial past policies, Khalilzad cautioned American policymakers against trying to exercise too much control over affairs in Afghanistan.
“Look, let them figure this out,” he said, emphasizing that a lasting peace plan would be the product of a broad coalition representing all Afghanis.... President Karzai cannot make the peace alone. He needs to bring the political forces of Afghanistan to the table.”
Despite these difficulties, Khalilzad remained cautiously optimistic while noting that the peace process was far from over.
“It will take a long time­­—as it did in Europe—for the region to become a normal region,” he said.

Students and Harvard employees marched in front of Lamont Library Thursday night, rallying in support of Harvard librarians as the University Library plans major restructuring.
At the march, Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung, who is also a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, made a short statement on behalf of the library employees.
Ralliers carried signs and chanted slogans such as “Hey, Harvard, you can’t hide. We can see your greedy side,” and “The people, united, will never be defeated.”
Rally organizers said that the event, which was planned the day before it took place, was meant to show solidarity between students and librarians in the face of the impending library restructuring.
“We thought it was important to have a rally this week because we wanted to increase Occupy Harvard’s visibility,” said Geoffrey Carens, a Harvard library staff member. “We want as many people as possible to really be aware of what is going on.”
Earlier this year, the Harvard Library Board recommended a restructuring of the University library system. Some library workers have protested elements of the new plan, in particular the University’s earlier hints at the possibilities of job losses and, more recently, the University’s proposal of early retirement packages.
The University has said that it believes the restructuring is needed in order to maintain the standard of Harvard’s library as the premier library system in the world.
“It is indeed because we love the libraries we cannot ignore the challenges they face,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email to the Harvard community last week. “We must direct our resources more effectively to our academic priorities.”
Anna Aizman, a graduate student in comparative literature and a student worker within the library system, said she attended the rally because she believed the new library proposals could have negative consequences for Harvard’s library system by reducing staff.
“In the last four years, library service has really been diluted,” Aizman said. “I’m worried that if we lose any more librarians, either to early retirement or job losses, we won’t be able to give our users as high quality of an experience. Student workers can’t provide the same quality of service that trained librarians can.”
Aizman added that she hopes the rally will help students realize the importance of the issue.
“I think if more people really know what’s going on, they would really care and get involved,” she said.
Andrew J. Pope, a doctoral student in history, said he attended the rally because he felt that it was an important way for students to support the librarians.
“We wanted Harvard to understand that this is part of a global movement against inequality, wherever it may be,” Pope said.
Carens said that this is the first of many rallies to come.
“This is a small event in a larger campaign,” Carens said. “We’ll definitely be back.”

In a display of strong Irish patriotism and optimism, Prime Minister of Ireland Enda Kenny discussed the recovery of Ireland’s economy at a talk at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
“Right now, we are on target to correct our budget deficit—steady actions the government has taken are sending strong signals to the financial markets about our determination to stick to our plans,” Kenny said, saying that Ireland saw its first economic growth in 2011 since the crisis began in 2008.
“This evening, I want to send a message to other countries that Ireland can be a role model for them,” he added.
Ireland was one of three countries in the euro zone that received a bailout loan from the European Union and International Monetary Fund to alleviate historically unprecedented deficits during the financial crisis. Since the bailout, Ireland has made significant progress in regaining what Kenny called “economic sovereignty.” Evidence that points to recovery, Kenny said, include a restructured and recapitalized banking sector, a drop in yield rates of Irish government bonds, and increased revenue without tax increases.
With the government deficit and national financial institutions stabilized, Kenny argued that the outlook is positive for Ireland’s standings in the international community.
“There is less talk about Ireland’s difficulties and more talk about Ireland’s recovery,” Kenny said. “Our exports are at record levels...with sectors [such as] software, pharmaceuticals, financial services, business services, and...[the] food industry performing particularly well.”
Kenny also cited the reduction of taxes in certain business sectors, modified access to credit, and other government tactics that will be key to further developing Irish exports and economy.
“What we have to develop is the challenge of stimulating our own indigenous economy,” Kenny said. “The government is focusing on improving the atmosphere and environment so that business can actually flourish.”
Ireland is expected to assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union next year, which Kenny said will be an invaluable opportunity to rebuild international trust and respect for the country.
“We will work to win the hearts and minds of Europe with a new sense of urgency, recommitting to...the ideal and possibility of a dynamic Europe,” Kenny said, mentioning agreements currently in progress aimed to strengthen budgetary discipline in the euro zone.
Kenny said that further recovery in Ireland and the euro zone will require more than just discipline and austerity measures.
“New fiscal rules will only restore confidence if they go hand in hand with greater efforts to support growth,” he said. “We need to do more to generate that growth and that confidence. We need bigger financial firewalls to protect countries pursuing sound economic policies.”

A day before they plan to end their occupation of Lamont Library Café about 20 supporters of the Occupy Harvard movement talked in the café on Thursday night about the next steps that they will take after they leave this most recent encampment when the library closes at 10 p.m. on Friday.
This discussion was one in a series of small “think tanks” that the group has held twice a day since the beginning occupation of the café Sunday night.
According to a flyer distributed by the protesters on Thursday, the think tanks were intended as a “discussion forum where we will engage and collaborate on topics at the heart of our communities, the libraries, and occupation.”
Protesters said that they created the think tanks to make it easier for participants and visitors to contribute their opinions on a focused topic.
The think tanks framed the discussions around questions such as “Is livelihood a right?” “What does the library of the future look like?” and “What is Occupy Harvard’s relationship with other Occupies both near and far?”
A day after the protesters parked themselves in Lamont, decrying the University's stated intention to reduce the staff of its library system, the University announced a voluntary buyout offer to long-term library employees.
At Thursday's conversation, protesters extended their campaign against staff reductions to a demand for a total reform of the library system.
“To me, if there is a future for...both college and public libraries, it is in the space that they offer in transforming the landscape of knowledge [and] providing the tools and literacy,” said Derin Korman, a teaching assistant in the visual and environmental studies department.
At Thursday night’s think tank, protesters said that they had been successful in their occupation because they raised awareness of their presence in the Harvard community and put pressure on the University administration to make a change in the library system.
Since most of Occupy Harvard’s supporters are graduate students, the protesters at the think tank discussed how to reach out to the undergraduate student body.
They said that their plans for the future include having outdoor think tanks during lunch hours and setting up 48-hour occupations in Harvard Yard when the weather gets warmer.
The protesters also plan on making their presence known during Junior Parents Weekend.
When asked about the police presence in Lamont Library, Harvard Divinity School doctoral candidate Hannah L. Hofheinz said that the police patrol was “ridiculous,” and that “the orders [to patrol Lamont] are not respectful—they are for the purpose of intimidation.”
“The police have had a hard few years, are overworked, under-respected, and under-supported—same as every other group of workers at Harvard,” Hofheinz added. “I really respect the fact that they interact in such a respectful way. They have a lot of integrity.”
Students studying in the café said that the occupiers have not been disruptive.
Claire B. Fitzgerald ’14, a Lamont Library Café worker, said that “we haven’t had any problems. We kept to ourselves and they kept to themselves.”

Wasserstein Hall, Caspersen Student Center, Clinical Wing—a new sustainabile facility that houses approximately 250,000 square feet of innovative classrooms and student space—opened its doors at Harvard Law School early this January.
The Law School recently submitted WCC for Gold LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council and will hear of the building’s sustainability status in the next few months.
INTERACTING WITHIN A SUSTAINABLE SPACE
Sustainability Coordinator Kathryn A. Cosgrove ’07 steps into one of the new facility’s classrooms, which, she says, were designed to “inspire a different method of teaching and learning.”
She points out features in the space that enhance the building’s sustainability.
Cosgrove first directs attention to the occupancy and daylight sensors on the classroom’s ceiling that facilitate energy-efficient lighting.
Circular vents on the floor, she says, are used for displacement ventilation, allowing both hot and cool air to flow out from the classroom floor and circulate throughout the room.
As the air exits through ceiling vents, it completes a cycle that eliminates cold and hot spots that students often feel in standard classrooms when sitting directly underneath vents or next to heaters.
The building also has integrated carbon dioxide sensors that adjust ventilation for crowded rooms by sensing the rise in carbon dioxide levels associated with an increase in the number of occupants, Cosgrove says.
When windows are opened, the sensors automatically shut off ventilation.
WCC’s green features are not limited to the building’s interior, Cosgrove says. A rainwater capture system uses runoff water to care for the surrounding landscaping along with vegetated roofs that provide insulation and white-painted roofs that deflect sunlight to keep the building cool.
“Productivity is one of the huge cost savings,” Cosgrove says. “The building provides high quality air and lighting, which allows students and their professors to focus more easily.”
Law School Green Living Representative Amrit P. Dhir says that the new WCC fosters a sense of community.
“The Law School is a completely different place now,” he says. “People used to hang out in the library or the cafeteria. The new building has brought students together and moved the center of campus.”
LEED-ING THE UNIVERSITY IN GREEN DESIGN
LEED, or the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is an internationally recognized rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council that grants four levels of sustainability certification—Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
WCC, which is currently under review, is expected to earn a Gold certification.
The Law School did not aim for Platinum certification, Cosgrove says, due to cost and the trade-off between additional sustainable features and user friendliness.
For example, Cosgrove said that rather than fitting the courtyard space with layers of solar panels in order to earn additional points, the Law School opted to make the lawn an enjoyable social space instead.
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SIMPLE FIXES
Harvard currently has 64 projects certified by LEED and 95 projects that are LEED registered and currently being processed for certification. A renovated suite of offices in the Law School’s Griswold Hall was the first LEED Platinum Commercial Interior Space in New England and the first among American universities. It is one of less than 20 projects in the world that have ever earned this title.
Cosgrove says that architects may adopt some of WCC’s new features—such as low-energy light bulbs—in other Harvard buildings if it makes “economic sense.”
While the sustainable bulbs may be more expensive up-front, Cosgrove says this kind of cost-benefit analysis is taken into account for LEED certification.
Law School Green Living Representative Laura B. Wolf echoes this sentiment.
“Some people look at the [WCC] and think it’s a huge waste of money,” she says. “But I think that when you build something green and well, it is a smart investment because it pays you back.”
The project has less expected benefits beyond its environmental and economic profile.
“One of my favorite things is that [WCC] does not smell like a new building because they use good materials that do not have chemicals in them,” Wolf says.
Green Living Representative David M. Jochnowitz says he appreciated changes as simple as trading old, bolted windows for openable ones that make it possible to regulate temperature.
“[HLS] took a lot of things into consideration, some of which were remarkably simple,” he says. “Little, obvious things can make it a better place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard freshmen who attended Brain Break in Annenberg Hall on Thursday evening could glean more than treats. On the first day that a new nightly Advising Corner was open in the freshman dining hall, students could chew on pre-concentration advising as well as snacks.
The newest pre-concentration advising project developed by the Advising Programs Office and the Freshman Dean’s Office, the Advising Corner seeks to make concentration advice more accessible to freshmen before the annual freshman Advising Fortnight, which will begin on March 26.
On weeknights until Advising Fortnight, concentration representatives can attend Brain Break to inform students about their departments’ undergraduate courses of study.
Assistant Dean of Upperclass and Concentration Advising Glenn R. Magid was present at Thursday’s Advising Corner to inform students about the program.
“The objective of the program is to offer departments another way to connect with freshmen who are thinking towards deciding their concentration,” Magid said.
Social anthropology was the first concentration to make an appearance at the Advising Corner.
Steven C. Caton, director of undergraduate studies in anthropology, said he believed that students would benefit from the Advising Corner hours.
“Through these conversations, students think [social anthropology] is less of a mysterious discipline,” Caton said.
He continued that this exposure was particularly important for his discipline because students may not have had other opportunities to ask questions about his field. “It is difficult to find a high school that offers a course in social anthropology,” he said.
“I think the program was interesting,” said Janin Alfonso ’15, a potential social anthropology concentrator. “It was a good chance to meet faculty.... They are very friendly and very supportive.”
Domniki Georgopoulou ’15 said, “I think a lot of people don’t know enough about their concentrations; they don’t know enough about their departments; and it’s great that they can meet people and get to know more about it.”
In an emailed statement, Elm Yard Resident Dean Sue Brown said that the Advising Corner “will give students the chance to ask concentration representatives lots of questions and hopefully help them be more confident in their concentration choices.”
Brown added, “I think it is helpful for students who are undecided to realize that the system is designed to give them time to experiment with different fields of study and discover (or confirm) their passion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Department of Education has closed its investigation into alleged discrimination against Asian Americans in Harvard’s admissions policies following the withdrawal of the initial complaint, according to a department spokesperson.
In August 2011, an individual filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education alleging rejection based on the student’s Asian American ethnicity. OCR began the investigation in January and closed it on Wednesday.
“We are pleased that the complaint against Harvard has been withdrawn and that OCR has closed the case. Harvard College welcomes talented students from all backgrounds, including Asian Americans,” wrote Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal in an email.
The same individual accused Princeton University’s admissions office of similar discriminatory practices, and that complaint has also been withdrawn.
But OCR’s investigation of Princeton is ongoing. Initially, the recently withdrawn complaint had been folded into a larger investigation prompted by an earlier allegation. Jian Li ’10 filed a complaint with the Department of Education in 2006 after being rejected from Princeton, according to a 2008 story in USA Today.
Harvard’s admissions office has long touted its “holistic” approach to reviewing applications. While the University takes ethnicity into consideration, the admissions officers consider it one factor among many.
“Our review of every applicant’s file is highly individualized and holistic, as we give serious consideration to all of the information we receive and all of the ways in which the candidate might contribute to our vibrant educational environment and community,” wrote Neal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At its finest, hockey is art. It’s five men moving completely in-sync with one another. It’s subtle beauty in constant motion, punctuated by jarring chaos and back-breaking violence. If hockey is art, then consider this year’s power play Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 and company’s “Guernica.”
In scoring 29 goals on 98 opportunities (29.6 percent), the Crimson’s (8-7-10, 7-4-8 ECAC) power play of senior Alex Killorn, junior co-captain Danny Biega, juniors Marshall Everson and Alex Fallstrom, and freshman Patrick McNally is not only the best in program history, but is currently leading the nation in efficiency and is on pace to be one of the 20 best power plays of all-time. It all started just over a year ago, when Donato decided to set aside a rigid structure and let his players’ artistic creativity shine.
“We basically stepped back and looked for what the best pieces we could put in place were,” Donato said. “We gave the guys a little structure, and within that structure, we gave them a lot of freedom for creativity. And they’ve done a great job with it.”
The change yielded almost immediate results. Harvard raised a nine percent conversion rate coming into last year’s Beanpot to 19.4 percent by the end of the season, which was good enough for 18th nationally. The improvement had a very noticeable effect on the team’s overall performance, as the Crimson went from being 4-18-0 before the switch to 8-4-1 after.
“At the end of last year we really started to get going on the power play,” Killorn said. “That helped us a lot coming into this year because we knew a lot of the players were the same. We expected sustained success.”
Donato hasn’t totally abandoned the structure that defined Harvard’s power play before the change, but instead has opted to offer players freedom within their prescribed roles. (See above info graphic for role description).
“Everyone has a certain role and responsibility, those are understood,” Biega said. “At the same time, if you have to break off from that role to create a scoring chance, there’s a little more flexibility.”
That flexibility has led to Everson, whose primary responsibility is to screen the goalkeeper’s vision, to score six goals on the power play, compared to just three in traditional five-on-five situations.
“[Marshall does things that you] don’t necessarily get a lot of credit for, like standing in front of the net and screening the goalie,” Biega said. “Those don’t really show up on the score sheet, but without Marshall our power play would not be as effective as it is.”
Similarly, McNally, a defenseman whose focus is preventing the short-handed opponents from breaking, has scored all four of his goals this season with a one-man advantage.
Despite its success on the power play, the Crimson offense is still only fifth in the ECAC in overall production, and had yet to score a short-handed goal until the third period against Northeastern on Monday–the first since last year’s Beanpot.
“We haven’t scored as many five-on-five goals as would reflect how well we’ve been playing five-on-five,” Everson said. “On the other hand, on the power play, even when we’re not playing that great it just seems like we’ll get one or two goals. It seems like the breaks and bounces we get always come on the power play.”
Though luck has played a role, attributing the bulk of the responsibility for Harvard’s success to mere chance discredits a tangible confidence the players have when on the power play.
“Just knowing that we’ve been so successful on the power play can give you some momentum in the sense that if you’re down, you know you have a chance to be up,” Biega said. “At the same time, you can’t rely on it to get you out of trouble.”
Therein lays the biggest problem for the Crimson this season. An over-reliance on the power play to get the team out of trouble has led to a program-record ten ties.
“A good power play scores at the right time,” Donato said. “We’re still chasing that a little bit. We have scored in the third period a little bit, as of late. But that’s something that I think can help us win games.”
With just four regular-season games left on the schedule, chances are good that Harvard’s power play will maintain the top spot nationally and remain a potent weapon for a team very much in the thick of things in the ECAC. But that doesn’t mean the Crimson is content with having one of the 20 best power plays of all-time.
“I honestly think we can improve our numbers on the power play,” Everson said. “Coach Donato has been really good about constantly improving the power play and not getting too stagnant. [We’re] pushing to keep improving and making it harder for other teams to play against us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
One week after the Harvard women’s basketball team (12-9, 5-2 Ivy) suffered a devastating loss to Princeton, the Crimson will attempt to bounce back on the road against Brown (14-8, 5-3) and Yale (14-8, 6-2) with second place in the Ivy League on the line.
Last Saturday, the Tigers (17-4, 7-0) came to Lavietes Pavilion and took no mercy against Harvard, piling on the points in an 84-56 victory. Princeton led by nearly 20 at halftime and extended their lead to 40 points at one time during the second period.
"We had a disappointing weekend last weekend," sophomore Christine Clark said.
After experiencing the humiliating loss, the team quickly changed its mindset to overcoming the defeat and winning its upcoming games.
"We won’t let the loss hang on our hands. We still have half of the Ivy League left and have confidence in the team," junior Victoria Lippert said.
After registering only eight assists in the loss to the Tigers, the team addressed its poor teamwork during the week.
"This week, we’ve been working a lot on communication and sustaining intensity, and that’s what we plan on doing against Yale," Clark said. "To move on from a loss like that [against Princeton], we need a win to fully bring us back."
The need to win will be as strong as ever for Harvard this weekend because the outcome of each game will carry huge implications in the increasingly tight Ivy rankings.
With the Crimson’s 5-2 Ivy record, Harvard is in third place in the conference standings, with the Tigers in first and Yale in second. A Harvard-Yale game is always special, but this time around, the two teams will fight for second place in addition to bragging rights. Because the Crimson came up short at home against the Bulldogs earlier this season, 68-63, Harvard will also attempt to take revenge and beat Yale on its home court. To accomplish the upset, the Crimson will have to slow down the Bulldogs’ shooters. Yale leads the league by shooting 33 percent from beyond the arc.
One key reason for Harvard’s loss to the Bulldogs last time around was the disappearance of co-captain Brogan Berry, who tallied only five points in the contest on 1-8 shooting. Since then, things have changed.
Suffering from a scoring slump, Berry said she called her dad last week, who was also formerly her coach, to ask for some tips for the Crimson’s upcoming games. The fatherly advice was apparently just what the senior needed as she netted 47 points combined against Penn and Princeton. By scoring 26 and 21, Berry scored 20 points on consecutive nights for the first time in her illustrious career. With 1,347 career points, Berry is currently sixth in Harvard history for points in addition to being third in assists with 492. The senior point guard could become the first Ivy player to accrue 1,500 points and 500 assists by the end of her collegiate career.
The Crimson’s first crack at redemption after last week’s loss will come against the Bears in Providence, R.I., on Friday. Harvard last faced Brown and came away with a home win on Jan. 29. Early on, the Crimson led by as much as 18 points, but with 4:31 left to play, Brown clawed back to tie the game at 54 points. Harvard rallied in the final minutes to re-establish a lead and finish with a 65-57 win, its second straight victory of the Bears. With Brown in fourth in the Ivy rankings, the Crimson will need a similar performance to avoid slipping further in the standings.
Clark said she expects her team to continue battling during the second half of conference play.
"We’ve come together as a team and really become focused on finishing the Ivy season strong," Clark said.
As the team hits the road this weekend, Saturday’s tough loss will be in the back of the players’ minds, but the squad can look back to last year in its search for motivation. On its last road trip through Providence, R.I., and New Haven, Conn., Harvard lost both games.
But at the same time, Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith wants her athletes to see the upcoming matches as a new beginning.
"It is the start of the second round, and anything can happen," Delaney-Smith said. "The players have had a great week of practice. We’re ready for both games, and we’re staying tough and staying competitive."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Potter Cup may be leaving Hartford, Conn. for the first time in 14 years—and its next stop might be Cambridge.
This weekend, the No. 4 Harvard men’s squash team (14-3, 5-2 Ivy) will contend for the Potter Cup, the highest prize in men’s college squash. This year’s College Squash Association Team Championships, held at Princeton, are expected be the most competitive in recent history. Despite its fifth place finish in 2010 and 2011, the Crimson is very much in the mix for the 2012 title.
"I think the national championship is in the picture," Harvard coach Mike Way said. "But if you fire that question at any coach, you’re going to hear every cliché known in sports. Our focus is on the match against Rochester on Friday."
The Crimson starts its run for the title on Friday against No. 5 Rochester (9-4, 5-0 Liberty League). Harvard’s team proved to be too much for Rochester to handle on Jan. 28, when it defeated the Yellowjackets, 7-2. But Harvard will be looking to use the match to rebound after a 5-4 loss at Yale on Saturday.
"We’re regrouping our guys after [the loss to Yale]," Way said. "We thought we had a good chance to beat them, but we didn’t. But we’re getting in the right mindset. We’ll put [our team] on the bus, and we’ll try to get the job done Friday. So we’re feeling pretty good."
If the Crimson can repeat its performance from its last contest with Rochester, it will move on to the semifinals of the national championship. There, Harvard is likely to face No. 1 Trinity College (16-1, 8-0 NESCAC), the Goliaths of the squash world.
The Bantams have hoisted the Potter Cup every year since 1998, for a grand total of 13 straight titles. Trinity had not lost a match in 252 outings until Jan. 18, when Yale upset the top-ranked Bantams, 5-4. Now that Trinity has shown signs of mortality, the championship race is wide open.
In a potential semifinal matchup, Harvard would be seeking redemption for its 7-2 loss to the Bantams earlier this year. As far as Way is concerned, this weekend is a different story.
"It’s the end of the season," Way explained. "You have some seniors who aren’t going to come back and experience [national championship weekend again], and this is what you’ve worked hard for all season to get a decent seeding. It’s the final test, three days and three hard matches…. On paper everyone has a chance to win."
Leading the way for the Crimson is sophomore Ali Farag, Harvard’s No. 1 player. Farag, the top-ranked junior player in the world, is undefeated on the year, but it will take a strong group of nine to win the three matches in three days. Ali will be contending for the individual championship in a couple of weeks, but this weekend he’s concentrating on bringing a team national championship to Cambridge.
When asked what it would take to accomplish that goal, he responded with one word: will.
"We are much more talented than any other team, and everyone in the league knows that," Farag said with confidence.
But Farag, who is competing in his first team championship for Harvard, said that it would take much more than talent to win the tournament.
"If you lose [in the first round], you can’t win anymore," Farag said. "We have to focus on everything, think of everything. Every point counts. We have to be at the top of our game."
Coach Way echoed his player’s sentiments.
"I think what’s happened with our team is that everyone knows we have a very talented lineup," Way said. "We haven’t had one match this season where everyone turned up on the same day, so the goal is to have that happen on the most important weekend of the season. We’ll see what happens."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin. Jeremy Lin. Jeremy Lin. Jeremy Lin. Jeremy Lin.
There. It’s out of my system. Unlike every other media outlet in the country, that’s all I’m going to say about that. Because this column is supposed to be about the Harvard men’s basketball team, and there’s a lot to discuss on that topic as well.
Over my 20 years of life, there have been three constants: death, taxes, and the Crimson losing in Jadwin Gymnasium.
Actually, I haven’t died, nor have I started paying taxes yet, so those aren’t actually true. But the third one is, as Harvard hasn’t won at Princeton since 1989, and has never swept the Penn-Princeton road trip in its history.
Those demons held strong once again this past weekend, when the Crimson survived a rowdy Palestra with a 56-50 win, then succumbed, 70-62, to its buzzer-beating, heart-breaking, no-real-grad-school-containing, Carlton Banks-accepting, Woodrow-Wilsoning, club-eating New Jersey rivals. Again.
The loss knocked Harvard out of both Top 25 polls, likely for good this regular season, while leaving the door open for Penn and Yale to make a late-season run at the Ivy title.
Though the defeat will hurt its potential NCAA seed, Harvard is still in good shape for the league championship. With a one-game lead and four of its last six at home (where it hasn’t lost in its last 25 games)—and the other two contests at beatable Cornell and Columbia—the Crimson is still the favorite to win its first outright Ivy title ever. But for a team with larger aspirations—a squad that is talented enough to win games in the NCAA tournament—there is still a lot that needs to be improved.
Most importantly, while the defense has been great all season long, the offense has been incredibly inconsistent. Though Tommy Amaker loves to emphasize "our bench and our balance," such an alliteration has resulted in a team that has averaged just 63 points per game since New Year’s Day. That’s good enough to win Ivy contests or beat another defense-oriented team like Florida State, but not to top more offensively-talented opponents in the Big Dance.
Harvard desperately needs a go-to crunch-time scorer for close games down the stretch, like the one at Princeton last Saturday. The team tried to turn to Kyle Casey, but the junior missed a makeable layup and four back-breaking free-throws late in the contest.
Meanwhile, Keith Wright’s mid-range game has been largely nonexistent all year, hurting the Crimson’s ability to run the pick-and-roll and leaving Wright stuck in double-teams down low. Outside, Laurent Rivard shot a combined 0-for-8 from three last weekend, and the team simply can’t win if it’s not knocking down the long ball.
I’ve watched every single one of Harvard’s 24 games this season, and, quite frankly, if you asked me to name the best player on the team, I would have no idea who to say. For while they’ve all been good, nobody’s been great, as Wright was last season when he won Player of the Year.
Freshman Corbin Miller was the team’s best scorer last weekend, making up for Rivard’s woes from three-point range. Shooting 47 percent on the year from outside the arc, Miller continues to serve as the offensive spark Harvard often badly needs, and he should certainly be seeing more minutes in the future.
Expecting a freshman to emerge as a go-to guy is a lot to ask, but right now nobody else on the Crimson has shown the ability to generate points on a consistent basis. Someone needs to step up and emerge as a closer.
But enough about Harvard—on to the rest of the league.
BROWN (7-18, 1-7 Ivy) AT HARVARD (21-3, 7-1)
There was an Eric Carle book I used to read as a child entitled "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?"
Let’s try it:
"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?"
"I see a terrible basketball team looking at me."
Yes, the Bears continue to underachieve and have lost five straight Ivy games by at least nine, including a 26-point shellacking at Columbia last Friday. This will be a nice way for the Crimson to bounce back from its Princeton loss.
Pick: Harvard 76, Brown 61
COLUMBIA (14-10, 3-5) AT PRINCETON (13-10, 4-3)
The Lions continue to impress. After hanging with Harvard for 40 minutes at Lavietes two weeks ago, they came home and dismantled Brown before losing by just a point to Yale.
He won’t win it, but Brian Barbour deserves serious consideration for Ivy Player of the Year for carrying Columbia by himself after Noruwa Agho went down earlier in the season.
But Princeton, as we know, is tough at home, and I’d expect it to pull out another close one.
Pick: Princeton 65, Columbia 59
YALE (16-6, 6-2) AT DARTMOUTH (4-20, 0-8)
Yale is 6-2 in league play, but it’s been extremely lucky to get there. Its 30-point home loss to Harvard was easily the worst of any team this conference season. Then, after barely squeaking by the Killer P’s at home, the Bulldogs had a rough road trip last weekend, being upset by a point in overtime at Cornell before barely surviving at Columbia.
Though Greg Mangano continues to dominate inside, things just haven’t fully clicked for the Bulldogs.
Luckily for them, they get to play Dartmouth.
Pick: Yale 69, Dartmouth 63
CORNELL (10-12, 5-3) AT PENN (13-11, 5-2)
Zack Rosen versus Chris Wroblewski.
The battle of the senior, redheaded, Jewish ballers. It’s going down like a dreidel after too many spins, an overly-dense matzo ball, or some Manischewitz after a long, hard day.
Because after Lin (okay, I mentioned him again) proved this month that Ivy-educated Asian-Americans can indeed play, it’s up to these two to do the same for the Ancient Eight’s Jews. The nation will be watching. Don’t let us down, gentlemen. You’re our best hope.
Pick: Penn 75, Cornell 67
YALE AT HARVARD
I would expect the Bulldogs to play better than they did the last time these two squads met, when Yale scored less as a team than Lin (yes, I know) did against the Lakers. Then again, I recently watched "Due Date," and considering the bulldog in that movie was hanging out with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifinakis, I’ve come to the conclusion that they can be entirely unpredictable.
The Mangano-Wright matchup will be one to watch again. Mangano, though, will hopefully be a little bit nicer to Wright than he usually is, considering that—as the current Ivy Leaguer with the most NBA potential—he will probably be a big beneficiary of Lin’s (whoops) recent success.
I’d expect Yale—playing for pride after its prior embarrassment, and for its season—to actually show up for this one. But the Crimson doesn’t lose at home.
Pick: Harvard 68, Yale 62
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
This is it Dartmouth. It’s your best chance. It’s now or never.
You’ve won one Ivy game in each of the last two seasons, and you’re going to do it again.
You don’t think you can? Of course you can! It’s Brown! You can beat Brown!
Yes, Dartmouth, I know Brown’s not a Division III team. But it plays like one! You can pretend!
This is your time. Every inspiring song and speech ever written was written for your moment, right now. This is "Eye of the Tiger," Al Pacino’s speech in "Any Given Sunday," and the 2008 Obama campaign all wrapped into one.
It’s right there in front of you, Dartmouth. Go out and seize the moment.
I believe in you, even though nobody else will.
Pick: Dartmouth 65, Brown 62
CORNELL AT PRINCETON
There have been a lot of great players to come out of these two programs recently, and many of them have found success playing ball elsewhere. Because while not all Ivy Leaguers are lucky enough to be the talk of the country and the biggest story of the NBA season (you don’t know that’s who I’m referring to!) it is certainly possible to continue one’s playing career around the world.
For example, Kareem Maddox is playing in Holland. Dan Mavraides is playing in Greece. Louis Dale is playing in Germany. Jeff Foote is playing in the NBADL. Ryan Wittman is playing in Poland.
What’s that? Wittman’s still at Morgan Stanley? Well, never mind then.
Pick: Princeton 65, Cornell 61
COLUMBIA AT PENN
I visited the Palestra for the first time last weekend, and it truly is all it’s made out to be. For one, it actually feels like a college basketball arena, rather than a high school gym (*cough* Lavietes *cough*). Second, you can just feel the history emanating from that place. And third, it’s built to allow noise to travel incredibly well. At times last Friday, even though there were only 7,500 people there, it sounded like there were 75,000. Just an awesome experience.
Also, it was fun to watch Rosen try to score in every way humanly possible, throwing up shot after shot after shot. Unfortunately for him, he finished just 6-for-21.
To be fair, not everyone can come up big in the most important game of his life. We can’t all be Jeremy Lin.
There. I’m done. 1,500 words and only 4.5 additional mentions of Linsanity. That’s way under the national average of 1,478 per 1,500. I’m very proud of myself.
Pick: Penn 70, Columbia 64
LAST WEEK: 6-2
SEASON: 19-3

You may remember last semester's buzz surrounding Cabot Café, which will reopen Monday after significant renovations.With $70,000 set aside for renovations, new arts-inspired events, and coffee that, according to public relations manager and barista Akanksha Sharma '14, students say "taste[s] better than Starbucks," Cabot Café is sure to look different.
Cabot Café will reopen Monday, Feb. 20 at 9:00 p.m. after having undergone major renovations. The space has been refined with new floors, outlets, lights, artwork, and furniture. Expect to find the same specialty drinks coupled with scrumptious and baked goods at low prices.
In an email, general manager and founder Jesse J. Kaplan '13 mentioned several new drinks, including the Mocha Loca, "a super chocolate-y mocha prepared with three different types of chocolate," and the Cloud Nine, made with vanilla and peppermint.
Cabot Café welcomes feedback from Harvard students. "Feedback is responded to [because] these are students who care about you," Sharma said.
Cabot Café is open from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Sunday-Thursday. For more information, visit their website or follow the cafe on Twitter @CabotCafe.

Feb. 12, 1942: Faculty Vote Sanctions Compulsory Exercise
A system of compulsory athletics, even to the extent of some military drill, a grim suggestion of the University's policy of military training in the first World War, will start immediately after spring vacation for all undergraduates, according to an official announcement yesterday from Director of Athletics William J. Bingham '16.
Under the new program, all undergraduates except present Seniors and those who are physically unfit will be required to take one hour of supervised physical training a day four times per week.
Hourly classes, which will include calisthenics, marching drills, and informal games, will probably be held at hourly intervals at Soldiers Field from 11 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Although plans are not complete as yet, this training may include climbing walls and jumping ditches under the direction of military officers.
Feb. 14, 1948: Police Catch New Coop Suspect in East Boston Trap
Local police investigators yesterday predicted quick and complete solution of the $50,000 Coop robbery with possible discovery of the entire loot, after State, Boston, and Cambridge forces staged a well-laid trap at a Carver Street, South End, hotel which resulted in the capture of a second suspect.
Besides turning up an envelope containing "a substantial amount of cash" police said they had learned how the bandits escaped from the robbery by switching cars in Central Square.
No arrest had been made as of last night, police reported, as the captive, a 47-year-old Boston man with a record of 30 previous convictions, was full of narcotics when captured, and is being "soaked out" before formal charge are filed.
Feb. 14, 1959: Barnard, Moors Refuse To Enter 'Cliffe Best-Dressed Girl Contest
Two 'Cliffe dormitories, Barnard and Moors, have refused to submit candidates to the Radcliffe Percussion's contest for the College's best-dressed girl, calling the competition "against Radcliffe principles."
Percussion, which requested each of the nine dormitories to enter a candidate, will select one girl later this month to represent the College in Glamour magazine's contest for the ten best-dressed college girls in America. Six dormitories have chosen candidates, with Comstock Hall planning to announce its two entries next week.
In describing the contest, Percussion quoted Glamour's ten basic points for a well-dressed girl. Among the qualifications were "good grooming--not just neat, but impeccable," an "appropriate campus look, in line with local customs," and an "appropriate--not rah rah--look for off-campus occasions."
Feb. 16, 1978: Antique Clock Is Stolen from Dana Palmer House
Thieves broke into the Dana Palmer House on Quincy St. Sunday morning and stole an 18th-century Welsh grandfather clock police valued at $50,000.
A University police spokesman said yesterday two or three burglars apparently entered Dana Palmer House about 3 a.m. Sunday and removed the clock, which was on loan from the Fogg Museum, from the building's first-floor hallway.
The spokesman did not say whether anyone was in the building, which is frequently used as a guest house for the Faculty, at the time of the theft.
