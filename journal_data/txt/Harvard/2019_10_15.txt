There’s nothing quite like watching an army of furry penises go to World War Cum (World War One, but co-opted?), and before Oct. 4, I would have said such a scene could not possibly exist. I was wrong: It exists now, it’s fantastically funny, and it’s part of the third season of “Big Mouth,” which, mercifully, has been renewed through at least its sixth season. Even if you’re way older than the kids in this show, there are cultural references for everyone, and while “Big Mouth” is at times vulgar, it deals with real issues the kids encounter with sensitivity and raunchiness that cannot be missed.
To preface: I don’t generally binge shows in under 24 hours, and I don’t typically watch animated TV. The latter is never quite as good as it should be, and, if we’re honest, so is the former — as well as headache-inducing.
“Big Mouth” is the exception to both rules. It follows a band of middle schoolers as they come to grips with their changing pubescent bodies and sexual desires, and is a show replete with hilarious one-liners and cringe-worthy encounters. Some storylines include Jessi battling her depression (also known as Depression Kitty), phone addictions, anxious first kisses, neglectful parents, being “out” at school but not at home, cultural perceptions of female and male bisexuality, and the history of the female orgasm.
Sure, the show is funny, but the best part of it is the empathy with which every character is treated, even the ones who are arguably less likeable. Everyone will say that they hated middle school, and “Big Mouth” transports us back to the reasons why — in a good way, of course. Jay’s hyperactivity is not the result of brattiness: Nick’s parents discover he needs Adderall when Jay’s own parents leave him at home (alone) on spring break. Of course, he promptly sells the pills, but that’s consistent — with a home life in tatters, deeper underlying issues can’t be fixed overnight.
“Big Mouth” deals, in large part, with the shame that kids feel as their body seemingly starts to act outside of their control. The first episode follows the girls as they rebel against a sexist dress code initiated by Dean Lizer — whose creepiness and misogyny will rear its ugly head later in the season, too. Missy not only gets a new Hormone Monster and truly comes into her own, but also becomes the very definition of the age-old worry: How difficult or demanding or assertive can a girl be before she becomes too much? Jessi has her first orgasm at age 13, a statistic that likely left many women watchers calling BS — all while cheering her along, of course.
The season finale attempted to go out with a bang, but the chaotic energy of the middle schoolers-turned-superheroes drowned out what “Big Mouth” does best: careful, incisive, and inclusive treatment of issues that teenagers face all the time. There’s less emotional depth in the closer, and viewers are left with the promise of more to follow now that the kids have graduated from seventh grade. This seems to be an interesting mistake. Will the next season take place in a high school that starts in eighth grade, like it does in Canada? After three seasons, it’s finally time for them to age out of middle school, but it seems like the writers didn’t quite think this part through.
Speaking of Canada: One episode features a “Netflix original” directly from Canada, accents, politeness, and moose included. Just as it does with stereotype of ubiquitously polite Canadians, “Big Mouth” continually takes familiar themes and elevates them shockingly and beautifully. The other fantastic facet of this show, other than the ways it addresses a rainbow of teenage social conundrums, is the fun it pokes at itself and other pop cultural references. Yes, this means that the Fab Five from “Queer Eye” make a cartoon appearance, that Billy Bush gets called out for not calling out Donald Trump on “Access Hollywood,” and that people who say GIF like the peanut butter brand get roasted.
Come for the character arcs and biting metacommentary, stay for Maury the Hormone Monster’s vulgar quips, Harry Potter-inspired vibrators, Featuring Ludacris, everyone’s favorite on-screen pet, and a budding friendship kindled by the creation of erotic fanfiction. Or, of course, come for all that and then stay for the wholesome emotional development of middle schoolers. As long as you watch the show.

In recent years, The CW has saturated the TV market with shows filled with beautiful people and less-than-engaging storylines. With its mix of superhero spin-offs and teen romantic dramedies, one of the greatest challenges this network has faced is crafting narratives that don’t rely solely on the sex-appeal of their cast. This phenomenon peaked with the emergence and cult-like popularity of “Riverdale.” In the first season, the story of Jason Blossom’s murder captivated audiences while the hot bodies of Archie Andrews and Betty Cooper added sex appeal. As the seasons have worn on, the plots have thinned and more clothes have come off. With the entirety of the Archie comics as reference, it shouldn't have been difficult to cultivate thrilling stories. The CW recently brought another classic story, “Nancy Drew,” to the screen with the hope of finding the proper balance between intriguing stories and the usual cast of attractive actors.
Based on the premiere, the trajectory of the show is still largely up in the air. With its intro showing the broken history of the town and setting the stage for what will be Nancy’s great mysteries and adventures, “Nancy Drew” does a fair job of enticing the audience and raising thoughtful questions. Sadly, this introduction is a poor imitation of what was initially shown in “Riverdale.” The slow pan across what appears to be a typical, cute little town nestled up against a happy body of water is less effective knowing its a copy, a mere sliver of David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” – the ultimate reference for these teen drama mystery shows. Overall, this is symptomatic of the introduction being a dupe of the more exciting and tantalizing one of “Riverdale,” now going into its fourth season.
Following a lackluster introduction to the town of Horseshoe Bay, the mood and the entire approach of the show changes. “Nancy Drew” quickly transitions from an imitation to its own independent show. There is no doubt that it is still a distinctly CW-esque show with moody lighting and an incredibly attractive cast set one year out of high school, but the show moves past this to gradually introduce the characters. The audience meets Nancy Drew, played by Kenny McMann, while she and her not-quite-boyfriend Ned “Nick” Nickerson, played by Tunji Kasim, are getting intimate before work. Clearly, this show aims to show how Nancy works through the pain and heartbreak of the untimely death of her mother during her senior year in high school. It attempts to show the real, human side of the famous girl detective so many knew and loved growing up.
With the location of the story well-established (albeit poorly) and the title character authentically introduced, the rest of the show follows suit with casual introductions and laughable dialogue. With Nancy taking a year before going to college because of her mother’s death, she begins work with former classmates at The Claw, a local diner which may or may not resemble Pop’s Chock’lit Shop in “Riverdale.” Little does she know that this diner will lead to her return to old hobby: sleuthing, a part of herself that died with her mother. It quickly becomes clear that the mysterious death of a well-to-do woman will haunt Nancy and her crew as well as stir up the history of the town’s annual Sea Queen, Horseshoe Bay’s take on high school homecoming or prom queen. The episode serves well to set the stage for a season of shenanigans and mischief.
“Nancy Drew” appears to be living in the shadow of The CW’s other successes, but if the tantalizing mystery and well-loved roots are respected, the show could very easily move to join the network’s repertoire of popular shows. With a traditionally beautiful cast of characters and what could grow into a great story, the show has promise even if the first iteration of the series wasn’t pure 24 karat gold.

From the OG “Finding Nemo” to the new-and-improved “Incredibles 2,” Pixar movies are inarguably a childhood staple. Though often forgettable, Pixar shorts are an important part of the movie-going experience. Here are the top five Pixar shorts guaranteed to bring out the child in you!
(For the sake of relevancy (and my sanity) the following list will only include Pixar Original Shorts — not feature-affiliated shorts.)
5. One Man Band (2005)
“One Man Band” kicked off a new golden age of Pixar Shorts when it aired with “Cars” in 2005. One-man bands Bass and Treble face off in a Transformer-esque musical battle to win the attention — and shiny gold coin — of Tippy, a humble peasant girl. Their efforts result in an overwhelmed Tippy losing her coin in the sewer, then proceeding to outdo both performers with her one-girl band. Classic and nostalgic, this short is a classic for long-time Pixar fans.
4. Presto (2008)
Arguably Pixar’s funniest short, “Presto” takes the classic “magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat trope” and flips it on its head — at some points quite literally. Aired with “WALL-E” in 2008, “Presto” features “Tom and Jerry” cartoon violence as a rabbit refuses to cooperate with a stage magician’s demands. This cartoonish subversion of the familiar trope is comedic gold.
3. Bao (2018)
“Bao,” which aired alongside “Incredibles 2,” had audiences sniffling at the tale of a Chinese-Canadian mother wrestling with empty nest syndrome through care of a come-alive steamed bun. Asian-Americans rejoiced when the short won an Academy Award the following year, but it’s hard for anyone not to get misty-eyed while watching this masterpiece.
2. Lava (2014)
Although unconventional with its music video format, “Lava” and its accompanying song sung by Kuana Torres Kahele and Nāpua Greig present a new take Pixar’s beautiful animation style and storytelling. The love story of two volcanoes tugs on the cliché inner romantic in all of us, and the calming, catchy tune is guaranteed to get stuck in your head.
1. Piper (2016)
Showed alongside “Finding Dory,” this marine life-themed short showcases the animation and storytelling talent of Pixar. The adorable baby sandpiper protagonist learns to embrace the chaos of the waves, and (despite some marine biology inaccuracies) teaches audiences to overcome challenges without shoving the overused Pixar model of life lessons in the audience’s face. Whether you’re trying to procrastinate doing work or looking for an instant pick-me-up, “Piper” is perfect for every occasion.

“Riverdale,” a CW show based on the Archie Comics, is well known for its larger-than-high-school plots and chaotic character arcs. But instead of cults, gangs, creepy quest games, or jailbreaks, the Season Four premiere took a break from all that. Instead, viewers got a well-deserved and heartfelt tribute to the late Luke Perry.
When last season ended, the trailer for the fourth promised the same amount of nonsense (if not more) as seasons past. Jughead is apparently missing, people have dark secrets that will change everything, and Betty is getting hit over the head with what looks like a rifle. But on March 4 of this year, Luke Perry — who plays Archie’s father Fred Andrews — passed away after suffering from two massive strokes. So, instead of kicking off the season by introducing a new antagonist (although how could they top Chad Michael Murray’s terrifying cult leader Edgar Evernever) or expanding even the slightest bit on the trailer, this episode put aside season-long aspirations and focused on one thing: Luke Perry. As it should.
Before the episode premiered, the cast spoke to Entertainment Weekly about Perry. Marisol Nichols (who plays Hermione Lodge on the show) claimed that remembering Perry as “the most important thing that we had to do.” Molly Ringwald, who plays Fred’s wife and Archie’s mother, explained that while Perry died before Season Three could end, the showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa wanted to wait until this season for the tribute, giving the cast and writers time to fully think about the best way to remember their late cast member.
The episode focused solely on Fred Andrew’s death and Riverdale’s reaction to his passing. Archie (K.J. Appa) is devastated when he hears the news that his father has died in a hit-and-run. He makes Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Veronica (Camila Mendes) double check that the body is really Fred’s. He insists on hunting down the driver of the car who hit his father and continually worries that he didn’t make Fred proud. But Riverdale rallies around Archie. Betty, Veronica, and Jughead (Cole Sprouse) drive a hearse to bring Fred home, and the townspeople line the streets with signs praising Fred. The kids sit around in lawn chairs, drinking beers and recounting their favorite memories and later Archie gives a touching eulogy at the funeral. There’s even a guest appearance of Shannen Doherty — who was Perry’s costar on “90201” a decade ago — as the woman Fred was helping when he was hit. All in all, the actor’s brought a grade-A performance and the episode is hard to watch without tearing up at least once.
However, Riverdale wouldn’t be Riverdale without those terrible throwaway lines that really make you wonder why you’re watching. When the kids talk about going camping, Jughead reminds his friends, “If anyone is scared of bears, well, don’t be, because Archie’s been attacked, like what? Multiple times and still survived.” As if we could forget that crazy fever dream of an episode. Speaking of fever dreams, Archie randomly has one that includes his grandfather and all the other Riverdale characters who have died so far. Jughead has another cringe-worthy line to cap it all off, calling Fred Riverdale’s “knight in flannel armor.”
In a way, with all the reminiscing, the tearjerker moments, and an appearance of the whole cast, it felt more like a series finale than a season premiere. But that isn’t necessarily bad. This is exactly the tribute Luke Perry deserved: While the show didn’t lose it’s cringy “Riverdale” charm, the focus was solely on remembering Fred Andrews, and by proxy, Perry himself.

“Words, words. They’re all we have to go on.” This may have been true for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as they navigated their role in Shakespeare’s “Hamlet”; however, the Huntington Theatre Company’s production of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead” goes far beyond the words of Tom Stoppard’s classic play. Stoppard’s play is known for its fast-paced absurdist monologues, using syllogisms and rapid-fire interrogation to explore questions about the trustworthiness of reality or morality of murder. As he interprets the role of the play’s titular Guildenstern, actor Jeremy Webb’s monologues are marked with sarcastic eyebrow raises and comedic gestures, giving these high-minded philosophical discussions hints of familiarity. Contrasts, like between the simplicity of Guildenstern’s declaration and complexity of actor Jeremy Webb’s performance, make Stoppard’s philosophical rants more accessible.
Peter DuBois’ production of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead” brings the Tony-Award winning tragicomedy to the Huntington Avenue Theatre’s stage from Sep. 20 to Oct. 20. The nearly three-hour play focuses on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who are called by Hamlet’s uncle, King Claudius (Ed Hoopman), and his mother, Queen Gertrude (Melinda Lopez), to “glean what afflicts” Hamlet after the murder of his father. As Shakespeare’s play “Hamlet” unfolds elsewhere, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are left in confusion to explore the questions of reality, death, and morality. Throughout their journey, the pair interact with the Player (Will LeBow) and his band of Tragedians (Laura Latreille, Zaven Ovian, Marc Pierre, Dale Place, Omar Robinson, Michael Underhill), and slip in and out of scenes from the original play. By the end, all of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s comedic musings culminate in their struggle to explain their tragic fate.
DuBois’ staging defines this production. At every turn, characters are put distinctly adjacent to each other through positioning or movement. As Shakespeare’s royal characters emerge in Act I, they move in a staged, exaggerated manner, weaving between walls behind Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who awkwardly adopt modern mannerisms, from chest-bumps to headlocks, at the edge of the stage. Everyone, from the rambunctious Tragedians to the ridiculously dramatic Ophelia (Meghan Leathers) seem to move quickly and fluidly around stumbling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, highlighting their confusion and emphasizing the distinction between their verbal tennis and the lofty Shakespearean language of others. The playful, sarcastic tone Webb adopts softens the density of his rants, and creates a platform for questions of purpose, identity and reality to interlace with trivial, casual conversation.
The absurdist nature of the play leaves the relationship between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern up to interpretation. Alex Hurt and Webb approach the two characters like goofy brothers, playing off each other’s comedic personalities. Hurt’s childlike Rosencrantz can come off like a doofus, but this portrayal makes his existential breakdowns even more haunting. The real standout performance is Webb, whose confidence and energy demand attention to every bit of Guildenstern’s words and movement. Both Hurt and Webb act with casual, modern mannerisms, but all other characters are stiff and staged, giving the spotlight to Stoppard’s commentary rather than Shakespeare’s play. While the overacting and staging of characters like Gertrude and Hamlet (Brian Lee Huynh) at times detract from the nuances of their stories, this contrast makes Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s ramblings more modern and approachable.
The production’s lighting design (David Lander) and sound design (Obadiah Eaves) enhance both its acting and visual elements. With a simple set of wooden flats and rigging, Lander’s work skillfully transitions between moods and settings. Royal characters, for example, are bathed in golden light, emphasizing their artifice and contrast from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, whose exchanges are often under flat wash neutral or blue light. By the height of Act III, much of the set disappears. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern stand in front of darkness and haze, dramatically illuminated from offstage, and the theater is flooded with dramatic rushes of sound until their speeches finally cease and they disappear into a void of silence and complete blackout. The shift to reliance on sound and lighting design rather than scenic design for storytelling emphasizes the very questions about reality and sensory experience that plague Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Through the energetic, stylized acting and dramatic lighting and sound design, this performance makes the existential and philosophical mysteries of the play relevant and approachable. The show itself, enhanced by its acting and technical contrasts, poses intriguing classic philosophical questions in modern form.

For a film about astronauts, “Lucy In The Sky” spends remarkably little time in space. Like several recent films of the genre — particularly James Gray’s “Ad Astra” (2019) and Damien Chazelle’s “First Man” (2018) — “Lucy In The Sky” is more concerned with exploring the psychology of its protagonist than any of the faraway places she visits. Like both of those films, however, this one falls short of its ambitions: Despite excellent performances and technical polish, “Lucy In The Sky” never quite overcomes the confused and uneven portrayal of its protagonist.
Directed by Noah Hawley, “Lucy In The Sky” tells the story of Lucy Cola (Natalie Portman ‘03), a NASA astronaut who struggles to resume life on Earth after a stint on the International Space Station. The character of Lucy is loosely based on real-life astronaut Lisa Nowak, who was arrested in 2007 for attacking the girlfriend of a fellow astronaut with whom she had had an affair. An ambitious overachiever since childhood, Lucy finds that her trip to space has left her jaded, unable to appreciate the comparatively “small” pleasures of day-to-day life. An affair with astronaut Mark Goodwin (Jon Hamm) does little to help, and Lucy’s mental state — as well as her marriage and professional reputation — quickly deteriorates.
This premise is promising enough. A slow-burning depiction of Lucy’s undoing could have been a gripping cautionary tale about the promise and peril of professional drive and ambition. Unfortunately, Lucy’s breakdown is treated as a foregone conclusion from the film’s first moments. The result is that the rest of the movie feels more like a muddled and repetitive exercise in voyeurism than a cohesive character study.
Lucy, we are told, is an astronaut of the highest caliber, a hyper-competent “cool customer” able to perform feats of technical complexity and physical daring without so much as an uptick in blood pressure. The glimpses we get of Lucy’s talent — such as when she amazes a flight engineer by reciting his entire pre-flight checklist from memory — are thrilling. But these moments are few and far between, overshadowed by constant reminders of Lucy’s inevitable breakdown. In one early scene, Lucy and her crew hurdle towards Earth aboard the returning Space Shuttle. As her colleagues busy themselves with trajectories and re-entry angles, Lucy sits teary-eyed in the back seat, apparently distraught by her return to Earth. Lucy’s mental state appears compromised from the very start, and her emotional arc is cut short as a result.
The reasons for Lucy’s breakdown are also poorly defined. Her musings on the insignificance of terrestrial life feel too abstract and philosophical to explain her increasingly erratic behavior. The constant pressure placed on Lucy by her controlling grandmother Nana (Ellen Burstyn) is much more compelling — the tension between them, Lucy’s mild-mannered husband Drew (Dan Stevens), and teenage niece Blue Iris (Pearl Amanda Dickson) is one of the film’s strong points. Ultimately, though, viewers are not expected to think too deeply about the causes of Lucy’s mental collapse. As Mark, speaking to Lucy, puts it in less-than-subtle terms, “You went to space, and it blew your fucking mind.”
Among the film’s strengths are Portman’s convincing performance (although her faux-Southern twang distracted on occasion). Hawley’s direction is mostly effective, too, if a bit heavy-handed. Protracted overhead shots, alluding to Lucy’s view of Earth from orbit, are beautifully conceived, but lose potency with each successive repetition. The use of changing aspect ratios to frame the on-screen action adds another element of visual interest.
The film’s craftsmanship makes for a pleasant viewing experience, but unlike many other films about space travel, “Lucy In The Sky” is light on visual spectacle. Like Lucy herself, some audiences may be frustrated by the small scale of this mostly Earth-bound film. Ultimately, viewers will need to decide for themselves whether Lucy’s emotional journey is convincing enough to make for a satisfying experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few months ago I came across a magazine full of colorized old photographs from the collection of Brazilian artist Marina Amaral. For a concept so simple, the effect was jarring. Seeing, in full color, Abraham Lincoln posing awkwardly in front of a tent, Ruby Bridges being escorted to school by a pair of suited U.S. Marshals, and tram traffic on Westminster Bridge in 1919 closed an emotional distance between me and these histories that I hadn’t realized existed. It was almost disorienting, as if the wall between two different compartments of my brain that had long been kept separated was suddenly removed.
Thinking about these photographs made me reflect on my relationship with the past. I interact with it everyday, whether it’s by reading old books about old characters, or hearing about my older relatives, or studying the ancient empires of the world. But in my mind these lives led and cherished and ended were merely like old black and white photographs. They were faded and stripped of the color that filled their lives, reduced to the simplest dimensions and expressed in shallow generalizations.
I think this phenomenon is something we all experience. We’ve forged this psychological asymmetry between us and those who lived before us, an asymmetry that implicitly assumes inherent psychological differences between us. We don’t put ourselves in their minds and shoes and see their experiences and their personal battles as contextualized versions of ours. We’re hung up on the trivial details, the obsolete language we imagine them using, the funny clothes and dated beliefs, and the grayscale world we picture them running about in.
Perhaps this phenomenon is just an extension of our general difficulty of empathizing with people we’ve never met. Yet it doesn’t feel like the whole story. Somehow it’s easier to think of John Johnson from Colorado’s anxieties and fears and hopes, and to connect those experiences with our own, than it is to do so with Ernest Hemingway.
As difficult as it may be to address this lack of connection, we stand to gain a lot from doing so. We represent just one sliver of the wealth of human experience, of the countless little minds speeding along, worrying and wondering and wishing just like us, all spilling from the same basic genetic spring. For one, connecting represents an opportunity to learn as a society. The next time we want to dismiss the value of learning from our past, we should hesitate, and ask ourselves if we’re giving enough credit to the constancy of the human thread between now and then. Culture changes — but its basic building block, the human mind, less so.
At a personal level, reconnecting with history is also an opportunity for learning. Pick up an old diary, or revisit an old book, and see if you can’t discover parallels between you and the person writing them, and if you can’t take some things away from the lessons your new companion synthesized over the course of their long existence. Remember that no matter how foreign their experiences outwardly appear to you, inwardly they experienced life much the way you do.
But more importantly, perhaps, the past can be a source of solidarity and comfort for us. It’s oddly comforting when you’re fretting over some test or date or game to think back, a thousand years, to some unnamed 20 year old, sitting in whatever circumstances with whatever specific worries, living through the same feelings, the same buzz in their body, the same beating heart, the same focusing thoughts. It’s oddly exciting when you’re happy about something, a new job or friend or date gone well, to think back three thousand years to another unnamed 20 year old, sitting in whatever circumstances with whatever specific good news, feeling the same rush of emotions, the same giddiness, the same urge to smile or jump or holler.
We live in a vast web of human history. Our minds tread paths that millions of others before us have walked before. Appreciating this provides us an opportunity to learn from history in a new way, an opportunity to be flooded with the full color of past human existence that our minds have hidden in black and white for so long.

On October 1, federal judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled in the case of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants in its race-conscious admissions process. In a nutshell, this lawsuit reflects the core of “the Asian American dilemma”: Do Asian American students with high academic achievement levels belong to a racial minority? Asian Americans are a racial minority, composing an estimated 6 percent of the U.S. population, yet often feel themselves being pushed into the social category of “honorary white” people. The diversity of Asian American experiences reflected through this lawsuit reveals just how complex the history and struggles are for a racial group that happens to be growing faster than any other in the U.S. While this decision should be celebrated for now, I hope the verdict is the beginning of a much-needed conversation surrounding Asian American identity taking place locally and globally.
Now is the time to take Asian American histories and struggles seriously, and to include Asian Americans in the national dialogue whenever race relations are discussed. There are also numerous steps within the Harvard community that need to be taken to work towards a more inclusive national dialogue surrounding race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and more.
While Asian Americans are generally academically high achieving and have a large presence on college campuses across the country, there are not enough Asian American centered curricula to acknowledge or appreciate Asian American culture, history, and politics. Nationally, fewer than 50 of the 5,000 degree-granting universities have Asian American Studies departments. Data compiled by Cornell University shows only 32 universities offer such a major (most of those schools are located in California). Harvard, along with 17 other colleges, offers some Asian American studies courses. Yet, the University still needs to establish an Asian Americans Studies department. As it is, the call for an ethnic studies program at Harvard has been ongoing for decades. Sadly, a couple of renowned Asian American faculty members left Harvard just this past academic year. But there is reason for hope as this fall, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay’s decision to hire a cluster of cross-divisional scholars in the areas of ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration during the upcoming academic year is the first step in the right direction.
Asian students and the Asian American community in general need to establish stronger intergroup alliances to firmly project the wide range of Asian American identities. Now is the time to take advantage of the spotlight offered by this lawsuit to bring attention to, and expand on, existing Asian American social and political activism. Starting with the current debate on affirmative action, more academic and community dialogue surrounding the lawsuit can help solidify the existing Asian American political identity established in 1968. At Harvard, the call to move towards a more inclusive pan-Asian community was discussed in an earlier Crimson article from this May, “A Balancing Act: Asian Affinity Groups Scrutinize Their Role On Campus.” According to Pew Research Center, Asian Americans are on track to become the largest immigrant group in the United States by 2055. The diversity among Asian subgroups, in terms of national and ethnic origin, requires critical examination of disparities in Asian immigrants’ socioeconomic status, language proficiency, and religious affiliations. While there are many well-established ethnic based communities, primarily Chinese-Japanese-Korean communities, a strong pan-Asian community that deliberately includes the stories and voices of Indian, Filipino, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and all other Asian voices, would greatly benefit Asian Americans in becoming a more visible political group.
Now is also the time to expand on the black-Asian intercultural alliance. It is not possible to discuss affirmative action without understanding the history of slavery. Likewise, it is also important to understand the unique immigration history of Asian Americans through waves of exclusion from the American cultural mainstream. In December 2018, Harvard Kennedy School’s 2018 Bipartisan Program on Newly Elected Members of Congress hosted a “Breakfast with New Congress Members” event that brought together the Harvard Black Graduate Student Alliance, the Harvard Kennedy School Black Student Union, Latinx Caucus, and Asian American and Pacific Islander Caucus to discuss priority policies in communities of color. Meaningful dialogue like this among student groups should become a much more common occurrence on campus.
This lawsuit has brought a much-needed spotlight to existing Asian American activism that has been ongoing for decades. In some ways, the lawsuit offers a window to reveal the various Asian political groups’ ideologies, economic disparities among the subgroups, and how the Asian American identity must extend beyond the Chinese-Japanese-Korean subgroups. However, the Asian conundrum does not stop with this verdict or its subsequent appeal. How do we best understand this highly educated racial group in the country? Existing research such as The Asian American Achievement Paradox by Min Zhou already explains how immigration laws have largely shaped the makeup of today’s Asian Ameican population. Now, we must popularize these scholarly works so that the general public can better acknowledge and sympathize with the adversity and oppression that Asian Americans face, stemming from the history of indentured labor, racial harassment, and perceived image as a model minority.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recently visited the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to conduct thesis research. After spending a few days requesting folders and files that last saw the light of day four decades ago, this trip helped to not only substantiate my thesis argument, but to also redefine and illuminate my thesis’ importance and impact on U.S. national security strategy.
But at a certain point, when I had requested pulled one too many folders and flipped through one too many files, I had to ask myself, “What is it all for?” I have heard many seniors ask this same question, with perhaps more agony, a week before their thesis was due. But the question does not seem to answer itself even when the thesis is completed. During his 2000 Class Day address at Harvard, comedian Conan O’Brien ’85 mentioned that he had written a thesis but that “no one is ever going to care.” He is probably right. The only person who will care about a thesis is the person who tirelessly researched, drafted, edited, and reviewed your thesis — but that may be more than enough.
Towards the end of his junior year, Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, was invited to write an honors thesis. As he perused the Porcellain Club’s library, he came across British historian William James’ “Naval History of Great Britain.” Roosevelt considered the six-volume work “invaluable… written with fullness and care” but also biased with its “succession of acrid soliloquies on the moral defects of the American character.” James’ pro-British bias was countered by “The History of the Navy of the United States” by James Fenimore Cooper, whose book Roosevelt found “very inexact” because it “pa[id] no attention to the British side of the question.” Roosevelt was disturbed that “each writer naturally so colored the affair as to have it appear favorable to his own side.” He set out to write a naval history of the War of 1812 that was “full, accurate, and unprejudiced” — and, incidentally, would change the course of world affairs.
Knowing little more about his subject than any other undergraduate at Harvard, Roosevelt poured over primary sources never before accessed, including “official letters, log-books, original contracts, [and] muster-rolls.” To grasp the precise circumstances of a certain naval engagement, Roosevelt even recreated two- and three-dimensional ships. His close friend, Owen Wister, Class of 1882, recounted numerous instances when Roosevelt was alone in his library, standing with one leg on the bookcase, sketching a diagram for his book in excruciating detail. Upon graduating from Harvard, Roosevelt finished the book’s first two technical-heavy chapters, and then subsequently published “The Naval War of 1812” in 1882 at the age of 23.
The book was not only revered as a definitive operational history of the naval war but also a catalyst for the American Navy’s rapid buildup in the 1890s. Through his historical analysis, Roosevelt crafted a historical justification for a policy of naval expansionism based on preparedness and modernization. Roosevelt hoped the book would, as author William S. Dudley states, draw “attention to the need for a stronger navy, so the nation could play a significant role on the world’s stage.” If America even wanted to fulfill its dream of becoming a world power, it would have to adopt the principles of naval expansionism. To achieve this aim, Roosevelt followed his thesis’ own recommendations.
As Assistant Secretary of the Navy and President, Roosevelt spearheaded efforts to increase the capabilities and capacities of the U.S Navy along with the skill, training, and education of American seamen. He routinely deployed this modernized navy to demonstrate American power and achieve his geopolitical objectives. These objectives included the decisive domination of Spanish naval forces in the Spanish-American War, the Colombian cession of Panama in order to build the Panama Canal, and the sailing of the Great White Fleet around the world to signal America’s status as a burgeoning superpower.
Sixty years later, another future President, John F. Kennedy ’40, applied “himself feverishly for a couple of months” to writing his magna cum laude thesis, titled “Appeasement at Munich,” or better known under its subsequent book title “Why England Slept.” Kennedy argued that the “Munich Pact should not be the object of criticism.” Instead, Britain’s inability to prepare for war should be based on the other factors like “the conditions of Britain’s armaments.” In short, Kennedy did not put a lot of stock in Munich analogies and the dangers of appeasement. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, when Kennedy told the Joint Chiefs of Staff that a naval blockade would reduce the risk of nuclear war, Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay said the “blockade and political action… will lead right into war… This is almost as bad as the appeasement at Munich.” Kennedy incredulously asked, “What did you say?” He then quickly left the room “just beside himself,” furious at LeMay’s attempt to compare his blockade to the appeasement of Hitler. Yet Kennedy’s own thesis about the origins that engender World War II allowed him to realize that if he followed LeMay’s advice and his Munich analogy, “none of us will be alive later to tell them [the military] that they were wrong.” Powerful stuff.
So, yes, right now your thesis may seem useless. And it may be, unless you utilize these insights to make decisions and shape your worldview — whether that be creating a naval strategy or averting nuclear war. Just like a thesis, the options are endless.

Last week, members of the graduate student union, Harvard Graduate Students-United Automobile Workers, announced intentions to hold a strike authorization vote in which a strike could be approved with a two-thirds majority of voting members. The vote will be held today, one year after the union began its laborious negotiations with the University administration — a loud and potentially powerful demonstration of the union’s frustration with the pace of that process. The call to vote not only heightens the intensity of the negotiations, which have already sparked protest, but also threatens a major disruption of Harvard academic life.
The continued bargaining sessions between the union and the administration reflect serious negotiations. A contract would contain terms that will last for years, and the sluggish pace of tentative agreements — at present, only eight with nearly 80 proposed topics including some weightier matters still on the table — demonstrates the degree to which both parties recognize the significance of their work. As we have opined before, we support graduate students in standing behind their ideals and sense of justice in this unionization process.
Their ability to convene a vote and come to a consensus as a reflection of their collective goals and values is admirable. We support the union’s right to decide what is best for itself and to leverage its power as an invaluable source of labor at the University in this negotiation.
To be sure, we have some reservations about the authorization vote as an effective strategy, given variable and sometimes low turnout for favorable union votes. The vote presents a serious risk: If the vote fails and the strike does not move forward, the union faces the possibility of losing considerable steam and signaling to the administration that its membership does not necessarily agree on some of the issues — not least, neutral arbitration for cases of sexual misconduct and discrimination, a provision we have supported — that its leadership has presented as top priorities.
Despite these concerns, we stand behind the membership and leadership to make the decisions that it sees as best representing and serving its collective needs.
Of course, another concern is the effect a strike would have on the academic life of undergraduates and other graduate students at Harvard, as well as the efficient pedagogy of instructors. The fear faculty, administrators, and students may likely have about the impact of a strike should stand as a powerful reminder of the importance of graduate student workers in our community. Their labor cannot not be taken for granted.
Harvard students cherish the work that teaching fellows and course assistants do. They are essential to our academic experience, and we hope that they achieve a fair package with minimal disruption to the academic experience. In recognizing the risks to the educational experience here associated with a potential HGSU-UAW strike, however, we hope that the University takes these intentions seriously and prepares to cope with and minimize academic disruptions that could befall students. It goes almost without saying that instructors must heed the University’s counsel and develop comprehensive contingency plans that do not compromise the quality of education provided on our campus in case of a strike.
As HGSU-UAW gears up to hold their strike authorization vote on the one-year anniversary of their beginning of negotiations with Harvard, we must consider the reverberations of this decision for both the union and students. We will continue to stand behind student workers. Hopefully, our peers will do the same.

Harvard Medical School received a $20 million donation from philanthropists Hock E. Tan and K. Lisa Yang to create a Center for Autism Research, which will study the biological factors behind autism, the University announced Thursday.
Michael E. Greenberg — chair of the neurobiology department at the Medical School — will be the faculty leader of the new center, which is named after Tan and Yang. The Center will be a part of the Harvard Brain Science Initiative, which seeks to “unite and inspire” brain scientists across the University, according to its website.
Greenberg said the Center will bring together various experts in schools including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Harvard’s affiliated hospitals.
“One of my goals is to bring the faculty in neuroscience across Harvard together to pursue various activities and research problems that are of interest and often involve disorders of the nervous system,” Greenberg said. “One of the challenges that face us now is trying to understand autism because it can affect as many as one in 10 individuals.”
Greenberg said that Harvard’s neuroscientists are still determining their research focuses, but will keep an “open mind” as they do so. One area of research that still requires more work is understanding genetic mutations and how they might affect brain development, according to Greenberg.
“Autism is an example of a difference that can give great insight into how the brain works, how it develops, and how it functions,” Greenberg said. “Since it’s been shown to be due to specific mutations, and that can be modeled in a mouse for example, where you make the mutation and then study brain development, we think that there’s promise towards really understanding both how the brain develops through studying these mutations and also making a contribution to the human condition.”
Tan — a graduate of Harvard Business School — and Yang have two children with autism. They previously launched a similar research center at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research in 2017; the new Harvard center will collaborate with MIT’s researchers. Tan and Yang’s contribution to Harvard brings their total autism research donations to $70 million.
Greenberg said he believes the center will have the potential to improve biological understandings of autism.
“We are very excited about the Center and hoping for great progress in the next few years,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate students across the University will begin voting Tuesday whether to authorize a student worker strike, marking an escalation in the negotiation process that began exactly one year ago.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ bargaining committee announced their plans to hold a strike authorization vote Oct. 8 as major contractual issues — including compensation, healthcare, and harassment and discrimination protections — remain unresolved.
“This is our chance to make our voices heard loud and clear to the administration, and to declare forcefully that the Administration must move on our key issues we care most about and negotiate the contract we deserve,” the bargaining committee wrote in an email to its members Friday.
Successful strike authorization would not immediately trigger a strike, but rather would permit the bargaining committee to call for a strike when it sees fit.
Voting will begin Tuesday at 8 a.m. in Wasserstein Hall at the Law School. It will continue throughout the week in 21 locations across Harvard’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses, as well as the Broad and Ragon Institutes on MIT’s campus, according to the union’s email. Voters will fill out a secret paper ballot.
The email lists voting times through Friday, but more times may be announced as voting proceeds, according to bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16.
All student workers who have signed a union card will be eligible to vote, and union cards will be available to sign at the polls, the email said. Student workers include former and current workers, as well as those who “expect to be employed by the university.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain reiterated the University’s position that the strike authorization is “unwarranted” in an emailed statement Tuesday.
“The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and has offered substantive proposals that address the concerns raised by HGSU-UAW throughout these negotiations,” Swain wrote.
In order to pass, the vote needs affirmation from a two-thirds majority of those voting — not the entire bargaining unit — based on rules set out in the UAW Constitution.
Beverley Brakeman, director of UAW Region 9A, which includes most of the Northeast, wrote in an email that this rule sets a higher standard for passage of a strike authorization than most other union decisions.
“Unlike other internal votes in the UAW, which are decided by a simple majority of those voting, strike votes have a higher bar,” she wrote.
The vote will be overseen by HGSU’s elections committee, which previously ran the union’s bargaining committee election in June 2018, and last month appointed two new bargaining committee members by acclamation.
Ahead of the vote, the bargaining committee emailed union members imploring its general membership to authorize a strike, but acknowledged that it was each worker’s own choice.
“How to vote is an individual choice for each member,” the bargaining committee wrote in its email. “We, your bargaining committee, recommend voting in favor of a strike authorization.”
Brakeman wrote that while UAW will provide assistance running the vote, the HGSU-UAW elections committee will be in charge of the “process and final ballot count.”
“As with all other phases of the organizing and bargaining campaign, experienced UAW representatives will provide support, guidance and coordination to help ensure the process goes smoothly,” she wrote.
Several organizations across campus offered their support to the strike authorization effort ahead of polls opening Tuesday.
Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate anti-sexual assault advocacy organization, issued a statement Oct. 9 calling on eligible students to affirm the strike authorization.
“A strike shouldn’t be necessary for students to have the power and care they deserve,” the statement reads. “But we need what our union can give us, and we are willing to fight for it.”
On Friday, the Harvard Law School Student Government also passed a resolution that "encourages HLS student workers to vote YES in the Harvard Graduate Students Union Strike Authorization Vote."
In 23 bargaining sessions since last October, the union and the University have tentatively agreed to eight contract provisions.
The union’s proposal that its members should be able to pursue sexual harassment and discrimination complaints through a third-party grievance procedure, however, has emerged as a sticking point. The University has rejected the union’s proposal, maintaining that student workers should pursue complaints through the University’s internal procedures. This dispute has prompted a protest, a sit-in at University Hall by union members, and an advertising campaign on prime-time national television.
In addition, provisions on wages and healthcare benefits remain on the table. The union’s initial economic proposals would have doubled expenditures for each graduate student, University Provost Alan M. Garber '76 wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates in April. The union, however, has disputed that characterization, and called the University’s proposed economic package a “net loss for student workers.”
HGSU first threatened to organize for a strike authorization vote in an open letter addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in July. The next bargaining session is scheduled for Oct. 17, bargaining committee member Lee Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in an email last week.

Undergraduate group Native Americans at Harvard College hosted an Indigenous Peoples’ Day event Monday, celebrating native cultures and petitioning Harvard administrators to solely accept Indigenous Peoples' Day as the official University holiday and cease recognition of Columbus Day.
Monday’s event, held in front of Matthews Hall in Harvard Yard, featured songs, dances, and narrative performances by Native American Harvard affiliates. Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Joseph P. Gone, faculty director of the Harvard University Native American Program, also delivered speeches. Both speakers discussed the importance of working with Native Americans to properly recognize indigenous history and culture at Harvard and in the greater Boston area.
McGovern said the Cambridge City Council’s 2016 decision to recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples' Day instead of Columbus Day was partially motivated by attempts to address past injustice.
“Cambridge’s history, however, like the rest of the country, is stained by the actions of our ancestors,” he said. “It’s up to us to right those wrongs on our journey to building an inclusive and equitable city, and that includes shelving Columbus Day to allow other perspectives and stories to come forward.”
In his comments, McGovern said there was a need for the city and University to consider historical context as it pertains to indigenous people when reflecting on their own histories.
“Any history that we tell about ourselves, this University, or this city, must rightly begin with [the Massachusett people],” he said.
“A blind celebration of Columbus, without any deeper analysis or critique, is really not appropriate,” Gone added.
NAHC also circulated a petition requesting that Harvard’s administration solely recognize Indigenous Peoples' Day rather than jointly recognizing it with Columbus Day. The petition had garnered more 1,200 signatures as of Monday evening. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the petition.
Following McGovern and Gone’s remarks, organizers exhibited Native American students’ culture and tribe-specific identity. The outdoor event concluded with a group dance. Attendees then moved indoors to Ticknor Lounge in Boylston Hall for traditional indigenous food.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who attended Monday’s event, said that it was the role of the College to “honor the history of voices that have often been forgotten or intentionally erased.”
Members of NAHC further acknowledged recent, tangible changes in the attention that they have received from the administration. According to NAHC Treasurer Kenard G. Dillon ’17-20, the administration has been more receptive to the group.
“The administration has been cooperative,” Dillon said. “They’ve been responding to our messages and emails, which they hadn’t done in years previous.”

Student organizations, College offices, and House staff organized several events around campus this weekend to celebrate National Coming Out Day on Friday.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life and Harvard College Speak Out Loud — a student group that aims to promote spoken word poetry — partnered to host “OUTspoken,” an open mic and social event, held at the Barker Center cafe Friday night.
In front of a backdrop of rainbow-colored pride flags, students put on musical and spoken word performances about issues of identity and belonging, specifically regarding coming out.
Sarika Chawla ’23 shared two of her original poems; her first poem discussed others’ perceptions of her as “the girl in the wheelchair.”
“It’s about my disability, my identity and sexuality — all those things — but it revolves around my disability,” she said.
“This day is important to my identity and the identity of many of my friends and classmates because it’s a day of just really celebrating who you are and how you identify, whether you choose just to come out to yourself or to other people,” she added.
Many Houses also organized celebratory events. Eliot House held its fifth annual National Coming Out Day stein — a regular house-wide social gathering — on Thursday in the Eliot Grille. Life-size cardboard cut-outs of celebrities such as Ellen DeGeneres and Jonathan Van Ness served as decorations and props for photos.
James P. Biblarz ’14, Eliot’s resident BGLTQ tutor, said he developed the event to bring more attention to the holiday at the College.
“I felt that National Coming Out Day was a really important event and something that hadn’t been super widely celebrated in college,” Biblarz said. “I was sort of looking for something Eliot could do to make a tradition and I had the full support of the Eliot faculty deans and the administration.”
Many students who attended the Eliot event also said they enjoyed the celebration.
“It’s really fantastic. Jimmy Biblarz — the tutor here who organized it — he is just such a great advocate for the community,” Eliot resident Juan M. Molina, Jr. ’22 said.
Despite the bright colors and proud celebrations, the National Coming Out Day events reminded some students there is still progress to be made to better support BGLTQ students at the College. Alyx J. Britton ’21, who attended “OUTspoken,” said they hope to see more initiatives that help transgender students in particular.
“I think the University lacks some really fundamental resources for queer students — in particular for trans students — such as gender-neutral restrooms [and] making it easy to change your name and pronouns across all levels of documentation in the University,” Britton said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has already piloted programs for students to choose their “first name, pronouns, and gender marker” on my.harvard — the website that hosts Harvard’s course registration and course offerings. Dane added that a form from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s website allows students to further change their “primary” or “official” name.
“If a student ever encounters difficulty or needs particular assistance with identity, the Registrar warmly and confidentially welcomes everyone,” Dane wrote.
Joseph C. Felkers ’22, who attended Eliot’s National Coming Out Day stein, said he recognized that efforts to better support BGLTQ students need to be ongoing.
“I think it’s something that Harvard needs to continually work on,” Felkers said. “However, the strides like this are very important and very beneficial.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council endorsed the graduate student union’s strike authorization vote and other initiatives at its Monday afternoon meeting.
The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers announced last week that it would hold a strike authorization vote. If two-thirds of voting members approve the use of a strike, the union’s bargaining committee would have the power to call for a strike whenever it deemed necessary. Voting for the strike authorization begins Tuesday, Oct. 15, which marks the one-year anniversary of the first bargaining session between Harvard and the union.
HGSU is calling for the vote to win favorable pay, healthcare, and discrimination and sexual harrassment protections in its contract, according to Ria Modak ’22, an organizer for HGSU who spoke at the council’s meeting.
In the event of a strike, participating student workers would not grade assignments or hold sections and office hours, Modak said.
UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 and Kirkland House representative Ajay V. Singh ’21 sponsored the legislation to support the strike authorization vote.
“The Undergraduate Council is endorsing HGSU-UAW’s strike authorization vote because we know that student workers make this university work,” the council’s statement reads.
The University has advised faculty members to prepare for a potential strike. Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote that the University does not believe that the union’s calls for a strike have merit.
“The University believes that calls for a strike are unwarranted,” he wrote. “The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and has offered substantive proposals that address the concerns raised by HGSU-UAW throughout these negotiations.”
The union first threatened to call a strike authorization vote in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in July. The letter cited stalemates in issues like sexual harassment and nondiscrimination, and healthcare. Since the union first started bargaining with Harvard in October 2018, the two parties have reached eight tentative agreements.
Some council representatives at Monday’s meeting said they support the strike authorization vote because the issue involves their constituents; roughly 400 undergraduates are employed as course assistants by the University and are therefore represented by HGSU.
“I think it’s important that we take a stand for the people that teach us and also for our fellow students,” Kirkland House representative Madison A. Trice ’21 said.
Others disagreed with endorsing the vote and argued that a strike by teaching staff would be detrimental to the learning of undergraduates, the majority of whom do not serve as course assistants.
“What about the 6,500 Harvard students who are not going to have their section this week and not have their office hours should the strike take place?” Adams House representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 said. “Our job is to represent the majority interest of our student body as College students.”
The UC also voted to fund other initiatives at its meeting. The UC officially established a Public Service Travel Grant, an initiative that Huesa and UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 planned over the summer; the program will provide money for seniors to travel to interviews for careers in public service. The Center for Public Interest Careers, the Institute of Politics, and the Office of Career Services — which will administer the grant — will contribute a combined $20,000 in funding. The UC will contribute an additional $2,000.
The UC also discussed partnerships with two external companies during its Monday meeting. The council formally decided to partner with UmbraCity to pilot an umbrella sharing service on campus for a semester, and they signed a non-binding letter of intent to pursue a partnership with Starship Technologies to bring automated food delivery robots to campus.
The UC also funded “office hours” for freshmen to meet with their UC representative, along with a challenge at HackHarvard, an event for programmers to create projects in teams, to create a platform that helps students form study groups.

Emmy Award-winning actor and creator of the television show “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” Rachel L. Bloom performed with improvisational comedy troupe Immediate Gratification Players Friday night in their 2019 Player of the Year show.
In addition to winning the 2019 Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, Bloom was awarded the 2016 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series-Comedy or Musical and the 2016 Critics’ Choice Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.
Bloom said at the beginning of the show that she was especially excited to perform at Harvard, particularly with IGP.
“My writing partner, who co-created ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,’ Aline Brosh McKenna, went to Harvard, which is why my character [on the show] did,” Bloom said. “Her boyfriend was one of the founding members of this improv troupe.”
The IGP members, all dressed in their signature red and yellow-striped ties, inaugurated Bloom as an honorary member of the troupe and presented her with a tie of her own, a Harvard sweatshirt, and a plaque.
The group conducted the show in “Armando form,” in which skits are interspersed with short stories. Bloom improvised two short stories using words volunteered by the audience — including “shofar” and “dragon.” The students in IGP then performed a series of skits inspired by her stories. At certain points in the performance, Bloom joined the IGP members in their scenes.
“She brought a great energy, I think, to the show,” IGP member Claire K. Yoo ’23 said. “She came out just wanting to improv with us, which was super cool.”
The sound of laughter and applause filled the room of the Student Organization Center at Hilles Penthouse throughout the performance. Roughly 150 people attended the event.
Several audience members said they appreciated Bloom’s wit, creativity, and ability to seamlessly enter a scene. Garrett W. Tanzer ’20 said he is a frequent patron of IGP shows and that he enjoyed the fluid structure of the performance.
“It’s always good when the whole performance is cohesive, like the skits connect to each other,” Tanzer said. “They’ve been doing that more recently.”
Past winners of the IGP Player of the Year award include Comedy Central sketch comedian Keegan-Michael Key, “Parks and Recreation” star Nick Offerman, and “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” comedy actor Colin A. Mochrie.
Audience member Helen M. Dajer, whose son was a member of IGP, said she enjoyed the fresh perspective provided by having a woman represented as the IGP Player of the Year.
“I thought she was game. I thought she was very adaptable,” Dajer said. “Of course, I was delighted to see a woman be the star guest performer because after three wonderful male comedians, it was lovely to see a woman perform.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Post-secondary education leaders highlighted the need for universities to adopt student-centered decision making during a panel on increasing student success in college at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Friday evening.
The event was held in conjunction with the Institute for Education Management’s 50th anniversary symposium. IEM is the nation’s longest running professional development program for college leaders, according to its website.
Dean of the Graduate School of Education Bridget T. Long, one of the three panelists, stressed the responsibility of higher education institutions to “meet students where they are,” both academically and mentally.
Long argued that colleges must inform students about expectations when they apply and arrive at their schools, pointing to a lack of clarity in government forms such as the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
“Some of my work has revolved around the FAFSA,” she said. “And when you’re talking with a lot of families, particularly low income families, first-generation families, they don’t realize that forms like forms like the FAFSA are just for information gathering. They think that they’re committing to something.”
James P. Honan, a panelist and a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Education, discussed educational institutions’ allocation of funds.
“Do we have finance data? Do we actually use it in resource allocation conversations around student success?” he asked.
Archie Cubarrubia, a deputy director at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, addressed the role of private organizations like the Gates Foundation in increasing accessibility for students to attend college. He noted that, despite these efforts, “we know that barriers that contribute to opportunity gaps in post-secondary education still exist.”
Cubarrubia frequently referenced his field experience, explaining that critically analyzing data can reveal key insights on how to improve student experiences, particularly for first-generation students.
The event concluded with a question and answer session from audience members hailing from schools all over the country.
“What I didn’t hear a lot about is it’s pretty well documented that our students are coming to us today with more emotional issues than they have ever had,” Dean of Mississippi State University's College of Education Richard L. Blackbourn said. “I personally have faculty that are struggling with how to work with these students.”
Cubrrubia responded that it was imporatnt to cultivating a sense of camaraderie at institutions.
“The institutions where we see the student success agenda thriving, there’s this notion that the institutional community is family,” Cubrrubia said. “It means looking at everybody — faculty, staff, students — as a whole person.”
Wick Sloan, a retired Bunker Hill Community College instructor who now writes columns for Inside Higher Ed, asked about the disproportionate levels of funding that are allotted at different institutions. He asked about discrepancies in “funding or spending per student” between community colleges, state schools, and elite private institutions.
“I’ve looked at all the finance data, and I don’t think you want a long lecture in that, but it is going to say it’s going to depend,” Long said. “It depends on what’s their field of study, what are they trying to accomplish, what are their goals and so forth.”
“I don’t know what the optimal number is, but I can tell you that we’re very far from it,” she added. “Equality is not what we’re going for, we’re going for equity. And so part of the major problem is the students who need the most in terms of resources and supports to help them navigate complicated lives and challenges are receiving the least.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 16, 2019 at 2:38 a.m.
Four years and several administrative changes after Harvard first participated in a national sexual misconduct climate survey, the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment on campus remains stagnant, according to the results of a 2019 iteration of the survey.
This year’s version of the Association of American Universities survey was administered nationwide in April. Across the 33 participating schools, 180,000 students responded, making this the largest ever survey of its kind. Harvard had an overall response rate of 36.1 percent — slightly more than 8,300 students.
Since the first iteration of the survey in 2015, Harvard’s Title IX Office has undergone substantial structural changes and instituted several new programs. The Office split in two in 2017, a move separating administrators who investigate sexual assault complaints from those who provide Title IX training and resources. Additionally, the University has since implemented mandatory trainings for students, faculty, and staff.
Tuesday’s data, however, suggests that these changes have yet to make a substantial impact on sexual misconduct at the University. Roughly 33 percent of all undergraduate women surveyed this year reported that they had experienced some form of nonconsensual sexual contact. In 2015, 31 percent of senior undergraduate women reported experiencing some form of sexual assault.
The national prevalence rate for nonconsensual sexual contact among undergraduate women, defined by the same eight criteria nationally as at Harvard, ranged from 17 percent to 32 percent.
Still, the survey reported that more than half of students surveyed trust the University with their sexual misconduct-related concerns: 50 percent of undergraduate women and 75 percent of undergraduate men said they think it is very or extremely likely that a campus official would take their report seriously.
Men were also significantly more likely than women to report that they had very or extremely good knowledge of the University’s definition of sexual misconduct, with 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.
Despite reported trust in the Title IX Office, only 41 percent of women and 27 percent of men made contact with a program or resource as a result of “penetration involving physical force or inability to consent.”
The most highly cited reasons for female Harvard students — both undergraduates and graduate students — not reporting sexual misconduct were that students thought that they could handle the problem themselves, that they didn’t think their concerns were serious enough, and that they felt “embarrassed, ashamed, or that it would be too emotionally difficult.”
The report offered several reasons why a student may not think an incident was serious enough to report.
“It may be that the student did not feel the incident was serious enough to be considered a violation of the school’s code of conduct,” the report reads. “But it may also be a judgment that the perceived consequences of contacting a program are greater than the consequences of the incident itself.”
Seventy-two percent of Harvard students who said the incident of sexual assault they experienced was not serious enough said they did not make contact because they were “not injured or hurt.”
In a letter from the survey’s steering committee to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Deputy Provost Margaret E. Newell and Business School professor Kathleen L. McGinn wrote that it will take a culture shift — in addition to the University’s resources and policies — to alleviate students’ worries around reporting.
“Formal policies and mechanisms for responding to reports of sexual assault and harassment are absolutely necessary,” they wrote. “But legal compliance, formal policies and procedures, and student trust in University procedures are far from sufficient means for reducing the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment in our community.”
This year’s iteration of the survey asked questions to garner incident-level data, including information about the lead-up location, the location of the incident, and the relationship of both parties involved. Most incidents of sexual assault or harassment occured between two students, in campus housing, and with the involvement of alcohol. Women and BGLTQ students were also significantly more likely to experience sexual misconduct than were men.
In an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday, Bacow wrote that the continued prevalence of sexual misconduct on campus was “profoundly disturbing.”
“We must do better,” Bacow wrote.
In a separate email to students, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana highlighted various resources on campus — including the recently released Title IX anonymous online reporting system — in an email to undergraduates Tuesday.
“Behind each of the survey data points is a person: a close friend, a classmate, or an acquaintance,” he wrote. “As we move forward, meaningful changes on our campus will rely on increasing prevention, support, and accountability among all members of our community.”
Bacow and Khurana also announced the University's plan to hold a town hall to debrief the survey results on Thursday. Khurana said the College will post additional resources on its website by the end of the week.
Several student organizations also reaffirmed their commitment to supporting those who have experienced harassment in the wake of the survey results.
“Response Peer Counseling is here for all students and we hope that students are aware of and comfortable with reaching out to us as a resource,” wrote Alicia M. Chen ’21, a co-director for Response — a peer counseling group that specializes in relationship issues, including sexual harassment and assault — and an inactive Crimson Fifteen Minutes editor.
Phoebe H. Suh ’22, an organizer with campus anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she is disappointed with the survey’s results but “not surprised” by the continued prevalence of sexual misconduct on campus.
“We're surprised that the University's response, as detailed in President Bacow’s email, is similar to the University's reaction to the results of the 2015 AAU Student Survey. Considering that there have been no improvements, we are discouraged by the similarity,” Suh said.
The University could not be immediately reached for comment on its response to the results Tuesday evening.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the 2015 survey was only distributed to undergraduate senior women. In fact, the survey was distributed to all Harvard students.

The Math 21 series holds a special place in many STEM students’ hearts, and there is no better opportunity than a Math 21b midterm to spread mass fear. Despite the wide variety of students for whom this class is a requirement, no one seems to enter that room calm and collected. This midterm season, we bring you the pre-exam panic of the latest Math 21b midterm.
“I can’t sit in the back because I don’t want to look at other people.”
Haven’t we all been here? Feeling clueless about a problem only to look up and see scores of students furiously scribbling down the answers? Plus, nothing sends a jolt up your spine more than accidentally catching a glimpse of an answer that has 10 more digits than yours does.
“Does anyone have an extra eraser? I make too many mistakes so mine got small and I lost it.”
Angrily crossing out answers is not a solution to your woes when space is limited and you’re writing in pencil. When there’s linear algebra to review, who really stops to think small concerns like whether one has the requisite writing instruments? If only we had erasers to erase our memories of those terrible two hours.
“Oh no! I forgot my watch!” “Dude, there’s a giant clock at the front.”
In the era of smartphones, who even realizes they’re not wearing a watch until they’re in a situation where they can’t sneakily pop it out for fear of the Ad Board? At least this way you won’t panic about running out of time on the test since you set your watch ten minutes earlier to avoid being late to class.
“After this, I have to go to STAT 110 office hours.” 
Ah, the ever over-achieving Harvard student who can’t get off the academic treadmill to breathe. The grind truly never stops. We feel almost as sorry for you as the student who declared, “I have a Physics midterm in 16 hours.”
While all midterms come to an end eventually, midterm memories (and quotes overheard at midterms) last much longer. At least you can eventually look back and be glad that it’s over.
