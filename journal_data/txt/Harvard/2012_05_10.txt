After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first year of Harvard’s renewed early admissions program, the yield for the class of 2016 soared to nearly 81 percent, a significant increase from last year’s rate of 77 percent, the University announced on Thursday.
This year’s yield, which measures the percentage of accepted students who choose to enroll at Harvard, marks the first time this number has reached 80 percent since the class of 1975 was admitted.
"It is a major jump," Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said.
In December, Harvard admitted 772 students under its early action program. Another 1,260 acceptances were extended in March. Overall, 1,641 of those admitted to the Class of 2016 accepted their offer of admission from Harvard.
Due to this high yield a very small number of students will be taken off the waitlist, approximately 25, Fitzsimmons said. The admissions office began reviewing waitlisted applications on Thursday, he added.
Though this year’s yield is not the highest the College has ever seen, Fitzsimmons said it is certainly the highest in the modern era of highly competitive college admissions, especially at the most selective institutions.
"It was a very different world. Harvard and our peer institutions were not anywhere near the national and international institutions they are today. It’s really almost like apples and oranges," he said.
Fitzsimmons said he attributes this significant increase in the yield to three factors—the return of early action, the continuing poor economic climate, and an increase in awareness of new programs at the College.
Fitzsimmons said that the renewed early action program was expected to have a significant influence on the yield. According to Fitzsimmons, students who apply early typically have a stronger interest in Harvard than those who apply regular decision, and are thus less likely to apply elsewhere when admitted early and are more likely to attend.
Fitzsimmons added that the College’s financial aid program continues to encourage students to matriculate.
"The financial aid program continues to be paramount in people’s decisions, even the people who might not be on financial aid, but who see what might happen to them and to their own jobs and their own financial situations," he said.
In addition, Fitzsimmons named the increased public profile of a number of newly introduced programs at the College—including new engineering programs at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—as factors in students’ decision to matriculate.
Of the other Ivy League universities, only Dartmouth has released its yield rate of 49.5 percent. Harvard’s yield is typically the highest among peer institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A desire to understand why America remained passive despite increasing incidences of violence towards Jews in Germany in the 1930s inspired Erik Larsen to write his most recent book “In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Berlin,” the author explained in a talk in Sanders Theatre Wednesday evening.
Larsen’s book chronicles the experiences of William E. Dodd, the American Ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937, and his family as they represented America during the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II.
“What would it have been like to be in Berlin in the 1930s and to not have known what was coming?” said Larsen.
He said he had been intrigued by Dodd because of Dodd’s lack of experience in politics, but wanted to focus the narrative on his daughter, Martha Dodd, who had countless affairs with powerful men in the Third Reich, and whose personal correspondences and diaries—which span seventy linear feet of writing—are preserved in the Library of Congress.
The talk also featured rare footage from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum of Martha Dodd and the various men she interacted with while in Berlin.
Another clip showed President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressing the American people as he stated them that “the United States must remain...un-entangled and free,” even while reports of violence in Germany appeared in newspapers every day.
“The problem with ‘could have done’ and ‘would have done’ is we didn’t do it,” said Larsen, refocusing his audience’s concern from what American failed to do to stop the Holocaust to what we must do as a country to prevent future genocides.
The title for Larsen’s book refers to the Tiergarten, the central park in Berlin around which many governmental buildings of the Third Reich were located.
“All of the action, at least in the book, takes place around the garden because it was the only place you could go without feeling surveyed,” Larsen said.
One couple in the audience said that they were convinced to visit Berlin after reading Larsen’s book. Mae Rockland Tupa said that her grandparents died in World War II after running to a synagogue that was soon torched.
“I had not wanted to go to Berlin for all those reasons, but...we said, ‘we have to visit Berlin to get things in perspective,’” Tupa said.
“Walking through the Tiergarten, we could recall passages from the book,” her husband Myron Tupa added.
