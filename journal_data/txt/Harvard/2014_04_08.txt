An unsigned letter to a peppermint manufacturer, a series of observations about cows, and a dream about a sentence in a trash can: these subjects represent a fraction of the many story forms on display in Lydia Davis’s book “Can’t and Won’t.”  This narrative diversity in addition to the stark simplicity of her prose and the sheer brevity of her stories—some are literal one-liners—make the MacArthur fellow and Man Booker International Prize winner’s work difficult to categorize. However, Davis’s work is united by a singular voice and style. Davis’s terrain is the quotidian, but through sparse prose and incredible candor, she is able to examine the minutiae and mundane elements of our lives in abstraction. In “Can’t and Won’t,” this approach renders luminous conclusions about human nature that linger long after the short stories reach their end.
  Though most of the collection’s stories lack a conventional narrative arc, Davis’s prose is incredibly satisfying. Some stories resemble poetry more than prose, such as “The Cornmeal,” a succulent description of the condensation caused by a hot dish of cornmeal, which is “taking action in its own little way.” Other stories consist of one-liners, letters, or lists. Davis also describes the varying inspirations for some of the stories, such as “dream” stories—stories influenced by dreams of the author and those related to her—and stories “from Flaubert,” which are derived from letters written by the French novelist and slightly rewritten. With few exceptions, these diverse stories are carefully orchestrated to maintain a delicious level of tension that culminates in startling conclusions just as effective as traditional narrative closure.  One story depicts an anonymous woman bent over a child presumed to be her own. The one-paragraph story is so concise that the unspecified “she” is barely introduced before Davis reveals the child is dead. The situation is gripping enough to be the premise of a longer story, but instead the story ends with, “In life, the child would never sit still for a photograph. She says to herself, ‘I’m going to get the camera,’ as if saying to the child, ‘Don't move.’” This tale may end with more questions than answers, but the language’s distilled intensity gives the story a sense of fullness.
  The sparse nature of the prose combined with Davis’s unflinching candor allows stories to serve as abstract examinations. Despite the casual title, “A Story Told to Me by a Friend,” which features a pair of long-distance lovers who have yet to meet, is told so plainly that it resembles a modern fable more than a piece of gossip. When one lover dies while the other boards a flight so they can meet in person, Davis conveys the tragedy of the ironic situation through a simple but surprising style shift. Though the last line is written in third-person like the rest of the story, Davis enters the mindset of the surviving lover to astonishing effect. When the lover visits the morgue to see his partner’s body, Davis states, “It was here, face to face with a dead man, that he first laid eyes on the one who, he had been convinced, was to have been his companion for life” (22). Without elaborating on the tragic circumstances or resorting to sentimentality, “A Story Told to Me by a Friend” is able to comment on how dreadful things can happen when you least expect them.
Fortunately, Davis’s frankness is also used for humor. One of the wittiest stories of the collection is “I’m Pretty Comfortable, but I Could Be a Little More Comfortable,” which is a litany of privileged problems that are equally humorous and cringe-worthy. These lamentations include “I need to go to the bathroom, but someone is in there,” “he doesn’t pronounce foreign words correctly,” and “the work I have to do this morning is difficult.” Though these situations are mundane and recognizable, they are incredibly accurate and illustrate the frankness of Davis’s syntax.
These beautifully spare and honest narratives make the stories from Flaubert pale in comparison. Davis, a highly regarded translator of Proust and Flaubert, states that, though she intended to keep Flaubert’s language and content as intact as possible, she did take certain liberties she felt were necessary. Though it is possible to see traces of Davis in her rendering of Flaubert, the translated stories seem flowery and overwrought when compared to her understated prose. Whereas Davis can draw sophisticated conclusions about human nature in one sentence or less, the Flaubert stories consist of dense paragraphs ending with dramatic exclamations. These graceless conclusions include, ““How insolent nature is!” “What a strange thing it is—the human brain!” and “Oh, we writers may think we invent too much—but reality is worse every time!”
  Despite the grand proclamations by Flaubert, Davis’s tales, whether bleak or humorous, are true to reality. In one of Davis’s dream stories, “The Dog”, an anonymous speaker looks away from his deceased pet then turns around to see him once more. When the speaker turns, however, the dog is gone; “In that one moment he has vanished: a moment too soon, they have wheeled him away.” This dream story is highly mysterious, but the concise piece captures the fleeting nature of nightmares better than a lucid explanation. Davis’s singular style ultimately provides “Can’t and Wont” with startling glimpses into the hopes and anxieties that are common but worthy of her acute gaze.

  “I didn’t cry at home or at the hospital because I didn’t want to add to my parents’ problems,” Ajay Mishra narrates in the touching, down-to-earth novel “Family Life” by Akhail Sharma. Based largely on Sharma’s own life and experiences, “Family Life” follows the life story of Ajay Mishra, the youngest son of an Indian family that immigrates to America in the 1970s during the first wave of Indian immigration. Initially filled with hope and optimism for a better future, the family encounters tragedy in America and is left in disarray and ruins. A unique, extraordinarily moving immigrant story, “Family Life” brilliantly breaks down the modern-day idealistic portrayal of the American dream and illustrates the importance of family over individual success.
 
  Sharma elegantly captures Ajay’s growth from an insolent, selfish boy to a mature young man through a touching portrayal of his life experiences. Ajay begins his story when he is eight years old and living in poor conditions of Delhi, India with his mother, father, and older brother Birju. As the narrator, Ajay holds nothing back from the reader. He confesses moments of self-centeredness during his childhood, depicting his eight-year-old self as an ignorant, selfish child. When his family decides to move to America, Ajay is forced to give away his toys, and writes, “The boy’s hand struck my palm. As soon as it did, I wanted my car back.” He even shows ignorance when tragedy strikes the family in America. When Birju is left brain-dead after he hits his head while diving at the local swimming pool, the accident devastates the family. Yet Ajay initially thinks to himself how great it would be to be the only child.
 
   Sharma skillfully depicts Ajay’s maturation and coming-of-age through his developing passion for reading, which in turn creates in him a love of writing. Ajay soon feels the destruction the accident has caused in the family, and he becomes a more independent young man. In order to avoid his parents’ fights that make “the walls vibrate...with rage” and his father’s hopelessness and alcoholism, Ajay turns to the world of literature and books. He becomes particularly interested in the life of Ernest Hemingway; as he loses himself in Hemingway’s adventurous experiences, he finds his passion for reading and writing and begins to write short stories mimicking Hemingway’s simple style. The level of sophistication that Sharma utilizes to write about Ajay’s growing interesting in writing helps paint his gradual character growth. He describes how reading these books made him feel transformed: “I felt like I was being connected to a world where stories were written…and had the sense that I was being taken away from my own life and brought into a world that was glamorous.” Although his parents, too consumed in their own grief, fail to notice Ajay’s budding maturity, Ajay uses his passion for writing to cope with the misery brought upon by Birju’s accident.
 
  At the heart of the novel’s success is its touching depiction of raw emotion that comes to life through Sharma’s simplistic language and realistic narrative voice. Sharma’s writing style is Hemingway-esque and facilitates an honest portrayal of human emotion. One evening, Ajay confesses his sadness to his father, who responds, “You’re sad? I want to hang myself every day.” Although much of the novel is mired in despair and grief, Sharma also creates powerfully moving moments of love and beauty. While bathing Birju, Ajay and his mother jokingly call Birju silly names and tease him, trying to forget about his disabilities. One night, Ajay even sleeps next to his brother and confides in him his insecurities and worries.
 
  Unlike many other novels about immigration that laud America as a land of opportunity, “Family Life” downplays Ajay’s success in school and later on in life in order to emphasize the idea that the fulfillment of the American dream cannot bring back the shattered pieces of Ajay’s family. Even though Ajay’s excellent grades garner attention from other Indian families, Ajay’s family cannot enjoy the success due to their internal fighting. And although Ajay does in some ways achieve the American dream—he ends up making a six-figure salary later on in life—his fulfillment of that dream ironically ends up meaning absolutely nothing when he cannot find ways to spend all his money. Instead, the novel emphasizes the value of family over the superficial accumulation of achievements and material wealth. “Family Life” beautifully addresses the narrow-mindedness of focusing on social prosperity and serves as a reminder that family always comes first.

It seems like forever since Marvel Studios was the new, cool kid on the block with Tony Stark as its punchy right-hand man. Unfortunately, a lot has changed since then. Faced with post-“Avengers” films bloated with bad characterization, lazy plot conveniences, and erratic storytelling, the question arose, thought but unspoken: had Marvel lost its magic touch?
 
Thankfully, the answer is no. Injecting the franchise with an emergency shot of introspection, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” proves to be the film Marvel so desperately needed. With an intricate, smart script and a more nuanced moral compass, “Winter Soldier” is not only one of the best—if not the best—additions to the Marvel cinematic universe but also a great stand-alone film about order in an imperfect society and the measures people will take to achieve it.


 
When viewers are re-introduced to Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Captain America is working for SHIELD, the government’s top-secret intelligence agency. Despite Rogers’s loyal work for the organization, he soon begins to question the motives of his boss, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), after he finds out about Project Insight, a preventative weapons initiative. When a mysterious group savagely attacks Fury and SHIELD accuses Rogers, Rogers must go rogue to look for answers. On the run from SHIELD and its chief, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), Rogers also faces the enigmatic Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who has been tasked by an unknown enemy to kill him.
 
Early in the film, Fury tells Rogers, “Don’t trust anybody.” The warning reflects the film’s smart move to deconstruct Marvel’s typical categorizations of good and bad. The effect is a suspenseful plotline and a much more complicated, exciting ethical gray area. In a particularly tense scene, SHIELD agents, after realizing there is a rat in their presence, draw their guns on each other. When the camera zooms out, every agent is on the defensive, but it’s not clear who belongs to which side. The result is a fascinating dilemma that motivates the film; the villains on the surface are not so different from the so-called good guys. When the primary antagonist finally reveals himself, it is the realization that his motive is essentially the same as that of our heroes—peace—that creates a sick feeling of fear.
 
While the film can be sometimes too quick to rebuild the boundaries of black and white, such as when enemies are shooting at Captain America and his ragtag group of misfits, it is not to the film’s detriment. People will be eager to pit “Winter Soldier” against Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” critiquing the former for not hitting the same levels of moral ambiguity. But it’s simply not Marvel’s style. And it’s not Captain America’s style.
 
Steve Rogers’s appeal is that he is an anachronism—a bastion of honest-to-God goodness displaced in a sullied world that perhaps doesn’t deserve him. Evans acquits himself beautifully to a Cap who is a bit wearier, frustrated, and aware of the life he has irrevocably lost. In a heartbreaking reunion, Rogers visits his former love, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), now aged and in a retirement home. She wheezes out, “It’s been so long,” and Evans responds with the appropriate amount of silent grief, eyebrows furrowed and eyes just a little sadder. The world of “Winter Soldier” is one of consequences. It is Captain America who must sort through the rubble, and Evans’s portrayal effectively evokes the burdens of that responsibility.
 
That is not to say that “Winter Soldier” is lacking in lighter moments; it’s a Marvel flick, after all. With delightful chemistry, the cast works wonderfully together to navigate the film’s emotional ups and downs. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow strikes the right balance between deadly and warm as she simultaneously kicks grown men off skyscrapers and cheekily advises Rogers on his love life. Equally as engaging, Anthony Mackie has an electric rapport with Evans as veteran Sam Wilson, who becomes the Cap’s partner-in-arms—so much so that it is hard to believe that the two characters have never met when they bond over their experiences at war. On the other hand, the Winter Soldier may be the franchise’s most terrifying villain yet thanks to Stan’s performance. With a ferocious display of physicality, Stan portrays the shadowy character as a rabid animal stalking his prey, inspiring terror in whoever is unfortunate enough to stand in his way.
 
The action scenes—while not particularly innovative—are slick, polished, and gripping. Fury’s nail-biting car chase on the streets of D.C. towards the beginning of the film is one of the finest Marvel has done. As Fury’s assailants try to forcefully break into his car, slowly but surely cracking the car window’s glass, anxiety and terror start to settle in as the seconds pass. The success of the film’s action sequences lie in the anticipation of what has yet to happen. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have also found infinitely more interesting ways to use Captain America’s shield. Whether it is ricocheting off bad guys like a pinball or being used to take down an entire helicarrier, the shield is much more exciting and deadly this time around.
 
Sure to leave ripples in the Marvel cinematic universe, “Winter Soldier” accomplishes what the franchise’s two previous films failed to—it actually matters. Thematically dense and narratively tight, the film breathes life into a series that was in danger of flatlining.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Spring brings with it sunny days, greenery, snowless streets, and thesis deadlines. For juniors submitting thesis proposals, it is only the start. Meanwhile, seniors who have spent the best part of the year pouring blood, sweat and tears (not to mention hours) into writing their theses at last turn them in.
 
Yet not all theses take the same form. While most students who write theses choose to demonstrate their academic scholarship through critical papers, each year a select group of students opts for a different path: the creative thesis. The work produced by undergraduates who are awarded creative theses varies widely with regard to medium as well as subject matter. Some are original literary works produced by English concentrators; some creative theses produced by students in other departments take the form of films and staged pieces. But these students are united by a belief that creative work is just as valid a way of demonstrating scholarly excellence as critical work.
 
WRITE OF PASSAGE
 
For students in the English Department, the process of writing a creative thesis officially begins in February of junior year, when concentrators who wish to do so submit their applications. But in reality, the preparation that culminates in writing a creative thesis begins far before this deadline. 


 
In order to be able to even apply, a student must have taken at least one creative writing workshop (many applicants for creative theses will have taken several). Students must also submit a cover letter that details their reasons for wanting to write a creative thesis and the writers who have influenced their style; a list of creative writing workshops taken at Harvard; a resume of relevant courses taken and any creative pieces published; a description of the thesis that includes the subject matter, nature, and approximate length of the proposed work; and a writing sample in the genre of the proposed thesis.
 
Once students have turned in this lengthy application, they are confronted with a selection process that, depending on the year, can be quite competitive. According to Lauren Bimmler, the undergraduate program administrator in the English Department, the number of students that applies for creative theses varies significantly from year to year. “In the last few years, we’ve had anywhere from 15 applications to…22 applications. [This year] we had 20 applications, which is about a third of our junior class.” The proportion of the applicant pool that is awarded creative theses is equally variable. “A couple of years ago 40 percent of the applicants who applied got a creative thesis. Some years where there are fewer applications, 90 percent who have applied have gotten a creative thesis,” Bimmler says.
 
Matthew S. Krane ’15, whose application for a creative thesis in poetry was recently approved, has planned on writing a creative thesis since the beginning of his time at Harvard. “By the time I got here, I had already sort of decided that a lot of the critical work that was being done in English didn’t feel as relevant to most people’s lives,” Krane says. “I had also decided that it wasn’t as personally enjoyable to me as writing…creatively.” 
 
Krane began taking creative writing classes his freshman year, starting with a nonfiction creative writing workshop taught by lecturer Darcy Frey. Next Krane took a poetry workshop taught by Professor Jorie Graham, who is now his thesis advisor.
 
Krane noted that the application process, specifically the outline of the project, is somewhat difficult to apply to poetry. “It seems like in a way you can’t know where you’re going before you start it,” Krane says. Still, he does have a loose framework in mind for his collection—Krane’s poems will take fairy tales and myths and rework them to reflect personal ideas and events from his past. One particular myth that interests Krane is a Japanese folk tale entitled “The Crane Wife.” He plans on including anywhere between 50 and 100 poems in his collection.
 
Junior English concentrator Ethan G. Loewi ’15, an inactive Crimson magazine editor, was awarded a creative thesis in fiction. Like Krane, Loewi came into Harvard with creative writing as one of his primary interests; taking creative writing classes while here only cemented that. “The fact that I’m not doing a critical thesis in no way suggests that I did not enjoy the more critical English classes that I have taken,” Loewi says. “But for me the difference is between something that interests me and something that I am really profoundly passionate about.”
 
Loewi says he would like to write about the Internet, exploring the ways in which it can connect people but also cut people off from one another and amplify loneliness. “The process I have to go through now is taking my broad, general vision and passing it through a million filters to wean it down to a number of specific divisions for individual stories and worry about how they interlock,” Loewi explains. “It’s just a very long process of refinement, but I love my subject material and the act of writing so much that I really don’t mind the grunt work.” 
 
Not all students who end up writing creative theses come to Harvard intending to pursue creative work. Prior to his freshman year, Kevin Sun ’14, an active Crimson magazine editor, had never done serious creative writing. Though Sun started writing for Fifteen Minutes early in his college career, and enjoyed doing so, he envisioned himself writing a critical thesis, possibly focusing on Joyce.
 
But then Sun decided to take Frey’s creative nonfiction workshop in the fall of his junior year to keep the option of applying for a creative thesis open. The class had an impact—early in the spring, Sun applied to write a creative thesis. 
 
A year later, Sun’s leap of faith manifested in his completion of a collection of creative nonfiction essays. The narratives address his experiences as a young musician learning how to improvise and being on the jazz scene. A jazz saxophonist enrolled in the joint program between Harvard and the New England Conservatory, Sun drew on his experiences during his summers in New York City to write his thesis.
 
ALL THE WORLD’S A STAGE
 

 While Sun wrote about recent experiences, Mallory J. Weiss ’15 will take a look back to the past through her playwriting thesis.
 
Weiss started taking playwriting classes her freshman year and knew right away that she wanted to write a creative thesis in the form of a play. Weiss will draw inspiration for her thesis play from a play she wrote last semester. This previous play, entitled “Beginning,” reinterprets the story of Adam and Eve and will run in the Adams Pool Theater from April 25 to April 27.
 
“[The] start of things really interests me,” Weiss explains. “A professor was talking about how Newton used the Bible to try to figure out how old the Earth is, and that was just a really interesting idea to me, so as of right now my [thesis] play is going to focus on the beginning of the world and the beginning of people and where we came from and having the characters search for the past and learn about the present and hopefully about the future.” She hopes to travel this summer to Cambridge, England, where Newton went to school. Regardless of where she is, she will spend the break “figuring out what the play is not going to be—a lot of writing and tearing up of paper.”
 
What is Weiss most looking forward to in writing her creative thesis? “The process of really [getting] a substantial play under my belt. Just really making my style better and taking risks and at the end, having this piece that I’m hopefully really proud of. The process will be exciting, but I’m definitely looking forward to that moment when I can say, ‘Wow! Look at what I’ve done!’”
 
Sam W. Marks, Weiss’s thesis advisor and a new addition to Harvard’s English Department who teaches two creative writing classes—“Introduction to Playwriting” and “Advanced Playwriting”—firmly supports the production of creative theses. “I think the [creative thesis] program is a great part of the department, and the work is generally really strong. It’s a really excellent culmination for the work a lot of the students are doing in the department,” he says. 
 
Mark’s role as creative guide has extended beyond advising writers of approved creative theses. “This year I found myself advising unofficially and working unofficially with several students who were not writing theses but who were writing plays they wanted to put out,” Marks says. “I hope that in the future I can continue to do that.” 
 
BEYOND HARVARD
 
For some students who write creative theses, the journey does not end with the project’s official completion senior year. Former Fifteen Minutes writer Mark J. Chiusano ’12 wrote a collection of short stories entitled “Marine Park” for his creative thesis. This year, the collection was published by Penguin Books.
 
Chiusano, who applied to creative writing classes twice his freshman year without success, took fiction writing classes with English Department lecturers Bret A. Johnston and Amy Hempel during his sophomore year before applying to write a creative thesis. Chiusano wrote a couple of stories in theses workshops about elderly people in a park near his house—Marine Park. He applied for a creative thesis with this in mind and spent the next year crafting the stories (with help from manuscripts and maps found in Harvard Library) that dealt with the creation of the park. 
 


Chiusano feels fortunate that he was able to publish the book and continue to write. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do after graduation—I wanted to keep writing and keep working on the collection, but I didn’t know in what form,” he says. “I was lucky in that a friend of mine helped me find an agent, and I worked on the collection for another six or so months, and then my agent sent out the manuscript to a bunch of publishing companies.”
 
Musician and poet Matthew A. Aucoin ’12 has experienced similar success. Aucoin, who writes both poetry and music, wrote a collection of poems for his senior thesis in English while simultaneously composing an opera. Recently, Aucoin had an opera commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. 
 
As both a musician and a poet, Aucoin feels the two disciplines really interact. “For me, it’s all really part of one process. I think of words as little pieces of music because if you kind of think about it in a more sensory way, they are shaped sounds such as you could make with an instrument,” Aucoin says. “To write poetry is to re-immerse words in what we hope to be their original music, to figure out some of the underlying significations to find the ones that might not be the most comfortable for us. So I think the more musically aware we are, the more accurately we can create language. And that formula works both ways.” 
 
THERE FOR THE TAKEOFF
 
The English Department does not have a monopoly on creative theses. Madeline A. Smith ’14, a joint concentrator in classics and music, recently completed her creative thesis—a musical based on Euripides’s play “Alcestis.” Smith, an active member of Harvard’s theater community, donned various hats in creating this musical—choosing and translating the text, composing all of the music, choosing instrumentation, and setting the words to music. “The aspect of classics that I love is their art—their poetry, their theater—and as an aspiring artist that’s why I’ve always loved it. So the first thing I knew was that if there was any way I could push my thesis in an artistic direction, that’s what I wanted to do.”
 
Smith credits her advisors, Professor Gregory J. Nagy from the Classics Department and Richard A. Beaudoin, a preceptor in the Music Department, with supporting her and enabling her to complete such an unconventional thesis.
 
Smith said her experience during the thesis confirmed her love of music directing. “After I graduate, I’m going to go to New York City to be a music director, and this thesis was really pivotal in me figuring that out because it affirmed how much I love the creative process and how much theater can do,” she says.
 
Beaudoin, for his part, said he thoroughly enjoyed the process of advising a joint creative thesis. “It’s really a joy because you get to learn a lot about a subject that isn’t your specialty and you get to watch the student struggle with and make something of that discipline, [which] isn’t your discipline,” Beaudoin says. “To see Madi choose a text, to see her translate a text and in the meantime realize how strange and interesting the text was…and then when it translates itself into a libretto and that libretto translates itself into a piece of music, then it gets really quite exciting because I’ve been part of the pre-thinking. Here, you’re there for the takeoff.”
 
VISUAL CREATIVITY
 
A joint concentrator in sociology and visual and environmental studies, Sheema Golbaba ’14 decided to display both the critical and creative sides of her studies in two theses: a critical paper in sociology and a film for VES. As an Iranian-American, she focused on the identities and assimilation of Iranians in the United States for both theses.
 
Golbaba stayed with families in Southern California, where a dense concentration of Iranian-Americans exists. “I looked for parallels and discrepancies between and across generations, from the grandparents, who sometimes can barely speak English, to the parents who probably came here either right before, during, or immediately after the revolution, and how their culture is essentially communicated to their kids and how their kids actually respond to it,” she explained.
Golbaba looked specifically at college-age Iranian-Americans. “At the time of 9/11, they were at a very critical juncture in terms of their development.” She stayed with each family for a few days and interviewed them in formal settings as well as observing their everyday life and constructed a cinematic narrative through it.
 
While Golbaba submitted her film this past week, she will continue to work on the piece until its screening in early May.
 
PUSHING BOUNDARIES
 Creative theses are possible even in disciplines that are not traditionally associated with them. Mariel N. Pettee ’14, a joint concentrator in physics and mathematics, created a dance piece called “Symmetry Breaking” that will be performed in Farkas Hall during Arts First on May 3-4. As both a physicist and one of the Office of the Arts’s “Emerging Choreographers” of 2014, Pettee was first made aware that such a project was possible while interning at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (better known as CERN), where she interacted with its Arts Department.
 
Pettee’s thesis aims to explain the Higgs boson particle to the audience in as many ways as is possible—through dance, through interactions between the dancers, through lights, and even through the audience’s own interaction with the piece as they hear noises coming from one room and must trace the noises back to the source in order to discover what is going on.
 
Like Smith, Pettee’s thesis was made possible by the cooperation of various groups to support her in her endeavor. “I’m so grateful—I’m receiving support from such a diverse group of people at Harvard, which suits the nature of the project,” she says. “My cast is this really eclectic and talented group, and so is my staff, and the people who have supported me are in the Office of the Arts, and in the Physics Department, and in the [Undergraduate Council], and in HRDC, so it’s kind of from all over the place, and it feels cool that I don’t know exactly where to place it, so it’s exciting how collaborations like this can happen.” 
 
THE PAYOFF
 
A collection of stories, a staged piece, or an original film may lack the surface austerity of 50 to 100 double-spaced pages of analytical writing. But the thoughtfulness and dedication with which students approach these projects, as well as the quality of the work they produce, suggest that in the mind of those who complete them creative theses are just as valid a way of demonstrating scholarship as their critical counterparts. 
Smith speaks to this point when she cites affirmation of creativity’s academic worth as the most rewarding part of her thesis. “This confirmed for me that creativity and artistic expression are valid forms of scholarship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With its countless a cappella groups, several orchestras, and a handful of student bands, Harvard’s music scene certainly possesses a degree of diversity. New heights of eclecticism, however, may have been reached this semester with the Department of Music’s artist-in-residence and Central Asian multi-instrumentalist Sirojiddin Juraev. In a performance on April 2 at CGIS, Juraev invited the Harvard community to join in a brief tour through the Tajikistani musical tradition.
Juraev is widely lauded as Central Asia’s foremost dutar player. The dutar, whose name comes from the Farsi for “two strings,” is a long-necked lute that is native to Juraev’s home in northern Tajikistan. The dutar, along with its many variants, can be found across central Asia and Iran, though its exact dimensions, design, and associated styles of play vary significantly. Juraev, whose father and grandfather were both dutar players, began his training at the age of 10. Over the next decade, Juraev mastered the dutar, along with several other traditional string instruments, including the tambour. He currently teaches at Tajikistan’s National Conservatory and performs in the ensemble Shashmoqom.
Juraev’s performance, preceded by a brief introduction to the Tajikistani musical tradition by the Harvard Professor of Music Richard Wolf, opened with a lively and rhythmically complex piece. Though he was limited to a mere two strings, Juraev’s involved strumming and picking technique allowed for a sustained and edgy chordal hum as he delicately toured up and down the thin fretboard. His rapid plucking of quarter tones, musical pitches halfway in between standard Western notes, lent the piece a finely riveted texture. Playing both original compositions and Sufi-inspired works, Juraev sampled a variety of instruments and exhibited a wide range of musical flavors. Subdued and woeful riffs ambled throughout his performance, punctuated by outbursts of exuberant strumming and swift fingerpicking. 
For some in the audience, Juraev’s playing elicited intense emotional and nostalgic responses. Jana Owen, a Cambridge resident who lived in Afghanistan for several years, said of her listening experience, “When [Juraev] was playing I could see the extraordinary steppes of Central Asia that are on the border to Tajikistan…. There are endless spaces, no barbed wire, nothing, just sky, and this earth. I don’t know, it brought me back to something.” Li Zeng, a current Ph.D. student in the Department of Astronomy who traveled throughout Central Asia and absorbed its music while growing up, described his interaction with Juraev’s music much as Owen did—with reference to nature. “The music’s notes…are like the flowing water of the mountains in Central Asia, as you can imagine. It can bring you through this time tunnel, a tunnel through space and time,” he said. “You can immerse yourself in that environment, you can feel the culture and also the information and the energy contained in the playing.” 
Although shy to speak himself, at one point during the demonstration Juraev similarly interpreted the underpinnings and inspiration for his music. Through Richard Wolf’s translation, Juraev said, “[I get my] inspiration through nature…its impression on my mood and condition. The spirit of nature.” Juraev is a true example of cultural particularity, one with a romantic eye for illuminating and reflecting a rich world of sensory and social experience far from the one with which we commonly interact.

Following 2012’s celebrated “The Seer,” Swans is back. Earlier this year, the American post-punk band announced that a new album, “To Be Kind”, was in the works; now, four years of songwriting and fundraising after their reformation, the eccentric rockers are almost ready to debut their creation. And if the new single is any indication, the full May release will be a disappointingly pedestrian continuation of Swans’s noisy, bizarre discography. “A Little God In My Hands” is soaked in the unsettling sound that has been the band’s trademark since their formation in the early ’80s.
 
The single begins somewhat traditionally; abrupt strums from a distorted guitar punctuate the foreground, while steady drums anchor the romp. However, around the one-minute mark, lead singer Michael Gira’s voice interrupts the texture, and from here the song settles into the same progressive rock elements on which Swans has always relied. Gira’s unyielding drone provides little melody to counterbalance the underlying simplicity of the chord progression. Instead, his lamentations give the single a feeling of unresolved monotony that lasts for the remaining six minutes.
 
As if Gira’s low whine wasn’t disconcerting enough, the lyrical matter is just as strange and harsh: “forever hateful, forever beautiful, forever needing, forever reaching.” The repetitive content pairs with the delivery to create an overbearing feeling of violent hopelessness. Weeping guitars, odd electronics, and blasting horns amp up the desperation. It’s completely uncomfortable, but from Swans, that’s nothing new.
 “To Be Kind” is out May 12 via Young God/Mute.

The Antlers have carefully built their home in dimly lit hospital rooms and recovery wards, piecing together whispered stories of love and abuse, denial and revelation, and forgiveness and regret, most notably with the visceral narrative of “Hospice” in 2009 and the desperate attempted recovery in 2011’s “Burst Apart.” The question now facing the New York band is what to construct next, after the hospital beds have been put away and the bodies laid to rest.
 
“Palace,” the band’s first single off their upcoming release “Familiars,” is a bit of an uncertain answer, but it’s in that fragile self-doubt that the track finds beauty. Eerie echoing effects like those off “Hospice” appear on the track, but so do the mournful horns that characterized The Antlers’s most recent EP, “Undersea.” Those elements combine to soothe rather than sear like they have before, and the simple and haunting piano hook that weaves in and out of the track could be straight out of a Hisaishi score and lends “Palace” the serenity of a lullaby.
 
It’s no children’s lullaby, though, as Peter Silberman croons, “I swear I’ll find your light in the middle / Where there’s so little late at night / Down in the pit of a well” with the combination of defeat and longing that has always imbued both his voice and lyrics. Still, there’s a new element of hope here that isn’t as much an attempt to close the book as to continue the story; The Antlers may not be at home like before, but the palace they’ve moved into seems haunted.
 “Familiars” is out June 16 via Transgressive Records.

Erika M. Anderson has one of the finest voices of her generation of art-rock auteurs—and it’s to her credit that she doesn’t rely on it alone. In her full-length debut as EMA, 2011’s “Past Life Martyred Saints,” she complements it with hauntingly bleak instrumentation and stretches it with unconventional song structures, from the opening seven-minute odyssey “The Grey Ship” to the noise rock of “California” and “Milkman.” It’s incessantly captivating, and her second effort, “The Future’s Void,” is further in the same vein, revealing Anderson to be as exceptional a musician as a singer, with rhythm and texture at the center of its success.
 
It’s dark and beat-driven—the first single, “Satellite,” opens the record with a wash of static, a feedback tone, and drum-machine handclaps, and within two minutes Anderson’s vocals fade under a Trent Reznorian electronic clatter. The percussion, inconspicuously deemphasized on “Past Life,” is the dominant presence on many of these tracks, and it’s responsible for some of the record’s best moments. “Neuromancer” is centered on a beat of machine-gun fire, breaking glass, and trash can lids, and it would be the record’s highlight were it not for lyrics like “making a living on taking selfies, is that the way that you want to be? / You’re such a narcissistic baby, you’re such a new millennial baby” that try insipidly for the voguish critiques of party culture EMA’s contemporaries have mastered.
 
The lyrics interrogate the Internet, fame, and technology with inconsistent success. The echoing ballad “3Jane” is interesting more in concept than for lines like “Feel like I blew my soul out across the Interweb and screamed / It was a million pieces of silver, watch them gleam,” but “100 Years” considers centuries of human progress in vivid figurative terms. It’s the Cold War at the heart of “Satellite”—its most ear-catching moment is when the beat switches and Anderson intones “I remember when the world was divided / by a wall of concrete and a curtain of iron.”
 
There’s an abstract style and sinister tone to the record’s better lyrics, in tune with the blackened instrumentals. “Cthulu” opens like an unreleased “Yeezus” track, with a synthesizer pulse that bleeds into distorted guitar, and the potential reference to the song’s Lovecraftian namesake closes the record’s most chilling lines: “There is the moment of the perfection / I’m looking those moments all my life / ’Cause if you can’t find any perfection / You know the other is inside.” The simple guitar-and-drum piece “When She Comes” functions similarly, with predictions “They’ll be begging for their lives / When they come” that draw power from their ambiguity before ending suddenly with an existential inquiry: “Not too long we’re in this world / So what’d you even come here for?” 
 
Anderson is in fine vocal form—“The Future’s Void” is a reversal of the voice-centric composition of “Past Life,” but her performance gives it balance. Her greatest virtue is versatility—she sings like three goddesses of alternative rock in one. It’s the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Karen O she channels on the record’s uptempo material, the stabbed yelps of “Cthulu” and the lo-fi rocker “So Blonde,” and Björk on the contemplative “Smoulder” and “100 Years.” Her aggressive whine on “Neuromancer” shows the influence of Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon. In each of these modes, her voice is no longer the center of her songwriting, it’s textural—a layer in the instrumentation or a component of the beat. 
 
With this dynamic, “The Future’s Void” is the ideal of the second album for an artist whose debut is as stylistically well-defined as EMA’s. “Past Life” is centered on her forceful vocals, its instrumentation and structure providing the backdrop. Her voice is present enough on “The Future’s Void” for the record to feel like hers, but with its essentiality to her music already established, she’s used her second release to develop the other side of her sound—her dark, ethereal composition. It isn’t a safe move, but its success shows EMA maturing intelligently.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The growing debate over tax reform became specifically relevant to Harvard last week when United States Congressman David L. Camp, a Michigan Republican issued a tax plan that proposed a set of reforms. These included reduction of the top individual tax rate, abolition of a minimum tax rate, and, most obviously pertinent to Harvard, an excise tax on university investment incomes. While tax reform is a pertinent subject that should be kept on the table for continued discussion, such a plan fails to address the main flaws within the tax system itself, and Congress is doing the country ill by looking to universities as quick sources of federal revenue.
 
The Congressman’s plan only aims to tax private institutions of higher learning with endowment assets of at least $100,000 per full-time student, and therefore targets only a certain pool of wealthier universities within the US, including Harvard. While it may be easy to envision further taxation of such a large endowment, we find that the congressman’s plan avoids greater problems with America’s tax code. If the new plan’s purpose is to effectively tax entities with large accumulations of wealth, then it fails to do so by reducing the top individual tax rate, as well as ignoring all the corporate loopholes that make tax reform so necessary.
 
There is little reason why universities like Harvard should be targeted more than other high-wealth institutions. Such universities can be thought of as corporations, but unlike hedge funds, they perform countless forms of public service—whether that means pouring millions of their own dollars into research, funding humanitarian efforts, or giving financial aid so that students from lower income brackets can have access to higher education. We wonder why such institutions would be subjected to taxation while other loopholes allow Warren Buffet to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary, and permit the NFL to be tax-exempt.
 Congressman Camp, who last year convinced President Obama to lower the corporate tax rate, should be applauded for his attempts toward reform, but his current plan targets the wrong institutions for tax revenue. Implementing such a plan would indirectly take away from funds toward public service. If the Congressman’s goal is to target large accumulators of wealth, he might have more success looking to greater problems within the tax code itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The governing council of Harvard Women, an alumni shared interest group, which since our founding in 2013 has focused on how we might support the University in finding solutions to issues of concern to alumnae and women on campus, convened last Saturday. This previously planned meeting focused on the problem of on-campus violence against women and was designed to include undergraduate input on so-called rape culture.
 
What timing.
 
What we heard made us even more unsettled than had our reading of Crimson articles on the topic. In response to both these articles and the stories shared during the meeting, we identified multiple mutual grave concerns about the newly announced presidential task force on sexual misconduct.
 
Concerning leadership, Dr. Steven Hyman is a highly respected scientist with extraordinary credentials. His expertise as a neuroscientist and his experience as an administrator are relevant and valuable, and his sphere of influence is prodigious. As provost, he was among the Harvard leaders who established the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, which speaks to his commitment to the issue.
 
However, the vast majority of victims of sexual misconduct are women. Furthermore, without devolving into reductive gender behavior stereotyping, women’s leadership may differ from men’s. Consider International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde’s statement in a 2013 interview in Harvard Business Review: “Studies show that certain characteristics are predominant in female leaders, like the ability to listen [and] the desire to form a consensus … which … is why women are good leaders in times of crisis.”
 
In a crisis defined by gender conflict, a male-female co-chairmanship would be a forward-thinking leadership model for the task force addressing it. The immediate appointment of a woman with an outstanding record in sexual violence prevention to aid Hyman would do much both to repair damaged confidence and to improve task force outcomes. Imagine a Lagarde-Clinton-esque high-five between female and male leaders on sexual assault prevention!
 
We are also troubled by the composition of the rest of the group. While there is representation from Harvard Business School, no Business School leaders in the organizational behavior unit are on the list. Faculty from the history and economics departments are included, but there is an absence of psychology department and women and gender studies program faculty. Strikingly, no one from the School of Public Health appears on the list. Additionally, no student advocate for improved prevention and services is included.
 
Perhaps the biggest affront of all is the lack of publicly represented survivors. We are in touch with a large number of alumnae who were victims, many of whom stand ready to serve on the task force as the public voice of survivors.
 
 
We applaud the trifold focus in the task force charge on prevention, after-care, and legal remedies, with particular emphasis on the first two. We are encouraged that despite the complexities inherent in the relationship between alcohol abuse and sexual misconduct, the task force will not shy away from examining it. With at least a 50 percent and some studies say closer to 90 percent coincidence of alcohol and sexual abuses, this quagmire is not one to circumnavigate. We trust that victim blaming will be studiously avoided.
 
Concerning outcomes, the charge includes the verbs “question,” “reflect,” “report,” and “recommend.” We suggest it go one step further and include the word “present.” With widespread attention currently directed at the crisis of on-campus sexual violence spurred by President Barack Obama’s recent establishment of a national task force on the issue, we are at a unique place in history where Harvard can make a difference.
 
Pride in our alma mater would be somewhat restored if Harvard could take the lead in sharing what the task force learns with the rest of the nation. We suggest a concluding open conference at which the task force’s recommendations are shared with the wider academic community. What better time than April—Sexual Assault Awareness Month—2015, precisely a year after the Crimson’s publication of Dear Harvard: You Win?
 
Last, but not least: Anonymous, our hearts are with you. Too many of us identify with you all too well. We virtually hold you in our arms, and are deeply sorry that our Harvard failed you on so many levels.
 
There were several things that made my class, the Class of 1980, and those immediately surrounding it, very special. We arrived at Harvard during a decade that witnessed a sea shift in the status of women in America and at Harvard. We were among the small number of classes to receive a Harvard-Radcliffe diploma, among the first to live in co-educational housing, to share Lamont, and to participate equally in varsity athletics. I was one of the first students privileged to work at the Schlesinger Library of the History of American Women, and my roommate Laura E. Schanberg ’80 was the first female sports editor at the Crimson. But we also confronted sexism at every turn. Although we took pride in Harvard’s integration of women and men, we hoped future women undergraduates would have an easier time being women at the College than we did. After reading last week’s stories and meeting with undergraduates, I’m aware that the more things change, the more things stay the same.
 
Alumni and alumnae have the power to hold the administration to high standards of transparency, gender equity, and inclusivity in this critical work. If we do, we have a much better chance of achieving the Harvard my classmates and I believed the integration of women into one of the most influential old boys’ clubs in the world could bring.
 
Lisa E. Paige ’80, is the president of The Alumnae Network for Harvard Women, a Shared Interest Group in the process of planning a survivor support event, entitled “Surviving Silence”, on May 29, details of which along with additional information will be posted at www.harvardwomen.net.

Conversationalist. Adventurer. Whimsical seriousness. Peanut butter. If you boiled me down to my very core, leaving only the essentials, that is what you would find. At least I think.
I know, though, with complete certainty, some things you would not find. My transcript. My resume. My last orgo exam. My application to Harvard. A summer job offer of any sort. An alarm clock.
But when was the last time that I celebrated my whimsical seriousness? How often do I feel good about the productiveness of my weekend because it included an afternoon adventure to a foreign square of Cambridge? Why can’t my time in college feel worthwhile simply because I converse each day with peers who are insightful and passionate beyond belief? And why doesn’t just eating some peanut butter (while thinking a little bit about life or maybe while thinking about nothing at all) feel like enough?
I answer these questions in ways that disappoint me because, too often, I allow my achievements (or perceived lack thereof) to define my identity and dictate my sense of self-worth. During the times when I am lucky enough to experience successes, such a method of self-evaluation does not feel so dysfunctional. When the achievements run high, so do I, and all is good and well. 
Invariably, though, the problems arise when the achievements fall short. If I allow an excellent mark on a paper to be indicative of my creative brilliance, how must I interpret a less stellar mark? If an interview request for a prestigious internship lets me feel like I am gifted, how must I internalize the dreaded “we’re sorry to say we cannot offer you a position this summer” e-mail? If my pride comes from the number of points above the mean that I score, then does a below the mean midterm mark mean I’m flawed as a human being?
Suddenly, this kind of thinking gets us stuck in an awful trap. When we tie our self-esteem to our achievements, we inadvertently allow our failures to be linked, as well. And before we know it, we have lost ourselves. 
But what about the crux of me? The whimsically serious, conversationalist, adventuring, peanut butter-loving me? What does a below the mean test score do to that me? The answer, of course, is nothing. Our academic and career pursuits, be they successful or failed, cannot touch the truest, most elemental parts of us. But when we define ourselves by these external measures of achievement, we yield this freedom and we forget ourselves. 
Moreover, if we measure ourselves this way, we become subject to unbelievable volatility of self-perception. It’s pretty simple —you just can’t be the best at everything. Inevitably, in our lives, we will experience successes and failures. In fact, success, failure, and something in between can all come to us in the same day. But how exhausting it is to let each shape our own understanding of ourselves. However, when we value ourselves based on different qualities— our essential qualities—we become free from such volatility.
Now, this is all much more easily said than done. And my point here is not to kvetch about an achievement-oriented society, wax philosophical on self-perception, or publically declare my over-the-top affinity for a certain nutty spread.
I write instead with a plea. A plea that we act with intentionality to help each other disentangle our identities and our self-esteems from our achievements. I ask that we do this not only to create a campus culture that is more enjoyable and conducive to mental health but for ourselves and our lives.
The disentangling will require that we make ourselves vulnerable, allowing what lies at the core of us to be known genuinely. The disentangling could involve discovery, surprise, and even disappointment. As we dig down to the core, we may find things that we did not know about ourselves, and we might not like all that we find. And the disentangling itself will involve failure. Despite our best efforts, at times, we will let our achievements define ourselves. 
And this is where we need each other. We must invest the time and energy to get to the crux of our peers—to know them truly. We have the power to show our friends that what we love about them has nothing to do with their achievements. We love the way that their voice gets obscenely loud when they are excited about something. Or that they make a point of reaching out to include people, even when they do not have to. Or how when they ask “What’s new?” they look at us in a way that says, “I actually want to hear.”
We think our friends know that these are the things we love them for, how could they not? We don’t care about their grades, their extracurriculars, their job offers. But when these marks of achievement can come to feel so important, we need each other to remember what is at our own core.
 We can celebrate achievements, but we cannot allow the achievements themselves to define us. We can help each other to be so much more.

In its McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission decision last week, the Supreme Court struck another blow to campaign finance restrictions—this time finding aggregate limits on campaign contributions unconstitutional. And I’m not even mad. When you’re already living in a two-walled house, you take little notice when another crumbles.
But I have a few unanswered questions.
Money is speech, obviously—but is my long-standing practice of cramming cash into the mouths of congressmen currently protected by the First Amendment? If my pet politicians misbehave, may I sue for damages? Can a class-action lawsuit be considered on behalf of all my friends who were only able to purchase a portion of elections last cycle?
Is Chief Justice John Roberts’ dismissal of the possibility that large donations could lead to corruption just a reflection of the culture of corporate citizenship and the selflessness of billionaires? Or does it just become easier to pull the wool over your eyes if it’s cashmere?
If  “ingratiation and access” are not corruption, as the court wisely noted in Citizens United, may I ingratiate myself by offering access to my private jet to politicians? Can they access my ingratiation via a solid gold telephone?
If the Framers wrote that the government was to be “dependent on the people alone” and “not for the rich more than the poor,” where would one find the secret to the First Amendment that our two esteemed originalist judges have stumbled onto?
Should I think that “the Framers would have been appalled by the impact of modern fundraising practices on the ability of elected officials to perform their public responsibilities,” as Justice Stevens wrote in his dissent to Randall v. Sorrell, or the more articulate summary sent out by the winning attorney in McCutcheon, who tweeted: “FREEEEDOMMMMM!!!!  #SCOTUS strieks [sic] aggregate limits in #MCCutcheon - woo hoo!”
Now that freedom and justice have been restored to our democracy, will similar justice be done in the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court? Will Clarence Thomas commit to a vow of non-silence? If not, could America settle for someone sitting the good justice down and informing him that quoting his previous dissents for a few pages does not constitute a Supreme Court opinion? If Clarence Thomas were to resign, should I prepare myself for the Second Coming?
While I understand that the plight of the few hundred people who were maxing out on the $123,300 limit over a two-year election cycle demanded the intercession of justices, now that the effective cap has been increased to $3.6 million for each election cycle, will the good court fight in this newest frontier of oppression against the ultra-wealthy? 
Since Chief Justice Roberts intelligently noted that “if there is no corruption concern in giving nine candidates up to $5,200 each, it is difficult to understand how a tenth candidate can be regarded as corruptible if given $1,801,” will similar reasoning apply to $3,600,001? What about $3,600,002? Does anyone else see a pattern here?
What about federal laws that still unconscionably ban corporations from direct contributions to politicians? Since they’re people too, my friends, doesn’t that effectively make them second-class citizens? When will they be given suffrage? Might we live to see the proud day when President General Electric or Senator Deutsche Bank takes office?
Will the 132 people who gave 60 percent of all super PAC donations in 2012 be left behind by the court’s decisions, with only their mansions and incalculable wealth to satisfy them? Will the vampiric Koch- and Adelson-funded political operations fold, or sink their teeth deeper into the spine of the American political system?
Will the timeless dances between candidates and the totally-not-coordinating super PACs still play out across our television screens, or will that be a relic from the past that we might display with pride to our grandchildren?
More importantly, what would happen if American elections did not seem as unsavory as dining at a Guy Fieri restaurant? What would happen if the constituents, not the contributors, decided our elections?

The City Council considered two policy orders Monday night that offered competing visions for how Cambridge should approach future development of housing, public spaces, and transportation. 
 
Policy Order 14—proposed by Councillors Dennis J. Carlone, E. Denise Simmons, and Nadeem A. Mazen—suggested that the city manager adopt a comprehensive master plan, which would provide a framework for future decisions about development projects citywide.  The alternative plan, Policy Order 15—authored by Mayor David P. Maher, Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan, and Councillor Marc C. McGovern—proposed that the Cambridge Community Development Department lead a series of public meetings to discuss a range of planning and zoning issues. 
 
The two proposals proved highly contentious with more than 50 individuals attending the meeting and voicing opinions on how to proceed with development. 
 
Advocates of the first resolution said that a master plan would ensure a more organized outline for future development projects. Supporters of Policy Order 14 also said that such a plan would prevent unbridled and disorganized development. 
 
“Cambridge is under siege and development is out of control,” said Paul Stone, a Cambridge resident who supported the master plan. “There is no unified vision...other than full speed ahead.” 
 
Critics argued that implementing a master plan would introduce excessive red tape and postpone much needed development, like the expansion of affordable green housing. In fact, many residents cited the current scarcity of housing as a major contributor to excessively high rent. 
 
Other attendees said they appreciated how the Cambridge Community Development Department plan called for input from the local community. 
 
“No one is against housing,” said attendee Bill Foster, who supported the involvement of the Community Development Department. “But we want smart housing.”
 
Other residents suggested that the two proposals could be reconciled, arguing that it is possible to implement a master plan that is also in line with public opinion.
 
Attendee James Williamson also spoke out in support of a combined approach.
 
“Let’s have a new master plan in the city of Cambridge based on community involvement,” he said.

As Harvard faces renewed questions about its handling of sexual assault cases in the College, members of the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights are still investigating a complaint against the Law School filed in 2010, which alleges that the school wrongly handled cases of sexual assault.
The complaint, filed by New England School of Law professor Wendy Murphy, is similar to a complaint filed last week by undergraduate activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better, outlining grievances with the College’s disciplinary system and informal accommodations process for alleged victims of sexual assault.
The undergraduate complaint came at the end of a week of heated debate surrounding sexual assault policy, largely triggered bya first-person, anonymous op-ed published in The Crimson last week. On the day the complaint was filed, University President Drew G. Faust also announced the creation of a University-wide task force, which she wrote was the product of “consultation with deans and others over recent weeks,” focused on community awareness and prevention efforts regarding sexual assault and misconduct.
The Law School’s case, which could result in a loss of federal funds if the school is found to be in violation, remains open nearly four years after the complaint was filed. In the complaint, Murphy alleged that the Law School’s administrative process of hearing sexual assault cases was not “prompt and efficient” and called for an adoption of the “preponderance of evidence” standard for determining guilt, which has become the norm across much of the Ivy League.
Law School spokesperson Robb London confirmed that the complaint was still pending in a written statement on Monday.
“Separately, HLS has participated in a University-wide review of Harvard's Title IX policies and procedures,” London wrote, referring to a Harvard-wide policy review launched in May 2013. “The review is nearing completion.”
The Department of Education’s press office was not able to provide information about its investigation at the time of this article’s publication.
Bernice R. Sandler, who worked with Congress to pass Title IX in 1970 and now serves as a senior scholar at the Women’s Research and Education Institute, suggested that a number of reasons could contribute to the delay.
"Sometimes [the Department of Education is] slow, sometimes they're very busy...and sometimes schools use delaying tactics,” Sandler said. “Four years is a little long.”
While the OCR often revokes federal funds from public institutions as a form of punishment, private institutions such as Harvard are less affected by such fines. Instead, private institutions often settle complaints through a memorandum of understanding, which typically stipulates administrative changes and publicly displays the institution’s mishandlings, according to Sandler.
"[Elite colleges] are more visible for what they're doing and not doing," Sandler said, referencing the significant amount of press coverage that followed the allegations of last week’s Title IX complaint.
After facing a similar complaint in 2012 that was investigated by the OCR, Yale University reached an agreement with the OCR and adopted a lower burden of proof known as “preponderence of evidence.” At the time, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison stated that Harvard did not intend to make changes to the University’s policies but would “learn from [Yale].”
The College, which relies on the “Sufficiently Persuaded” standard of evidence, is one of only two Ivy League schools not to have adopted the more progressive standard embraced by Yale.
Murphy said she is frustrated that her complaint has yet to be resolved.
“Harvard says they have zero tolerance for violence against women. Then why do they refuse to apply the preponderance standard of proof?” Murphy wrote in an email. “The effect of such a rule is tantamount to declaring the word of a woman less valuable, less credible and less worthy than the word of her attacker.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Joshua DuBois, the former “pastor-in-chief” to the Obama administration, gave the William Belden Noble Lecture at Memorial Church on Monday evening, discussing the fragmented state of faith in America and the challenges the nation faces as a result.
 
In a lecture entitled “Approaching the Ledge: Why America needs a crisis of faith—and why, in order to save religion, we must be willing to let it die,” DuBois argued that modern courageous, moral, and religious leaders seek God for objectively self-centered concerns.
“Instead of seeking God for the big things, far too many people have made God infinitesimally small,” said DuBois, who formerly served as a special assistant to President Obama and an executive director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. 
DuBois introduced the concept of “approaching the ledge” with personal anecdotes from his childhood, notably the plight his single-mother faced after leaving DuBois’s father, who he said had physically abused her. He recalled how his mother “improvised a beautiful life for me out of thin air [while also] carrying a hidden burden.”
He said his mother seriously considered ending her life and “walked to the edge,” summoning God to give her a sign of his presence.
DuBois compared his mother’s experiences with those faced by the Hebrew prophet Elijah, Martin Luther King, Jr., and President Barack Obama. 
In contrast to the issues of “eternal importance” that these iconic figures handled, DuBois said that individuals nowadays concern themselves with issues like “whether Christian bakers should bake cakes for gay weddings.”
DuBois also made note of how progressive congregations have increasingly diminished the role of God.
“The bible has been replaced with a Chomsky reader and the blood of Christ with the fruit punch of politics,” he said.
Amy Wetzel, a student from Eastern Nazarene College who attended the event, said she understood many of DuBois’ concerns. Wetzel said she was “frustrated that people make such huge deals about things that are not as important.”
Sarah Briggette, another Eastern Nazarene College student present at the lecture, said she enjoyed how DuBois “took a specific appreciation for the aspect of the separation of church and state,” despite being both a religious leader and a public servant.
Though DuBois said much of his career is at the intersection of religion and politics, he said he is concerned that figures on both the Left and the Right avoid the act of approaching moral and ethical “ledges” that call for the intervention of an omnipotent God.
 “We are afraid of what would happen if we put ourselves and put God in situations that would require more of God,” DuBois said.

Whether he was on the basketball court or in a Bible study, friends and teachers remembered Andrew ‘Andy’ Sun ’16 as a bright student, a humble listener, and a passionate spiritual mentor.
Sun, an Economics concentrator from New Jersey, died early Monday morning in Massachussets General Hospital, where he was being treated for injuries he sustained after jumping off a Boston building on Sunday. Sun, who was 20 years old at the time of his death, was a resident of Pforzheimer House.
In an email to Pforzheimer House residents, co-House Masters John R. Durant and Anne Harrington ’82 invited students to a community gathering in Pforzheimer on Thursday at 8 p.m. According to the email, there will be readings, music, a candle-lighting ceremony, and collective and private opportunities to share memories of Sun.
Well-known on campus for his active involvement in Harvard College Faith in Action, a non-denominational Christian group, Sun spent much of his time at the College praying with classmates and reading scripture, according to friends.
“He was always really eager to reach other people and pray for and with other people,” Shaun Y.S. Lim ’15, the president of HCFA, said.
According to Lim, Sun and a few of his friends started a morning prayer initiative last fall and invited community members to pray and read scripture with them at 8:45 a.m. every weekday.
John T. Hoffer ’16, a member of the service organization Phillips Brooks House Association, wrote in an email that Sun was also dedicated to mentoring with PBHA and had spent this past J-term tutoring children with the South Boston School program.
“I love everything I remember about Andy Sun,” Hoffer wrote. “His personality is genuine, and that's what made his long laugh so breathtaking.”
Sun attended Montville Township High School in New Jersey, after moving from China the summer before his sophomore year of high school, according to his high school principal Douglas Sanford. During his time at Montville Township, Sun served as president of the math club and was active in the environmental club, robotics club, and the Key Club, according to Sanford, who added that Sun also helped with many other student initiatives.
“Andrew was known as a motivated, inquisitive, and hardworking student, who participated in national and international robotics competitions and co-founded a tutoring business while at MTHS,” Sanford said in a statement.
Sun was also nominated for the Presidential Scholar award during his senior year of high school, took courses at Columbia University, and was a research assistant in the Biomedical Engineering department at Columbia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences all before he matriculated at Harvard.
Sun’s academic success continued once he arrived at the College, according to Yaron G. Nili, Sun’s teaching fellow for “Economics 970: Sophomore Tutorial.”
“Andrew was very intelligent and kind mannered,” Nili wrote in an email. “His participation in class sessions and assignments always demonstrated remarkable analytical ability, creativeness, and knowledge.”
Outside of the classroom, Sun was known for his ambition on the basketball court. Jacob Kim ’16, an HCFA member and an active Crimson design editor, said his favorite memories of Sun are of the times the two would play basketball.
“Me and Andy, we weren't the greatest players,” Kim said. “He would always shoot threes. He would always go for it.”
Friends also described Sun as quiet, unassuming, and a great listener.
“He was always a relaxed guy too,” Peter J. Hickman ’16 said. “I often always remember him being around, hanging out, just seeing what the guys were doing.”
Kim added that Sun was “not quick to speak, more quick to listen.”
Andrew B. Pardue ’16, a friend of Sun’s from HCFA, said that he began going through his email recently after Sun’s death to look for email exchanges between the two. In his inbox, Pardue said he found an unopened email that Sun had sent during finals week last December. Pardue said the email included an encouraging Bible verse.
 
“This was typical of Andrew, reaching out, encouraging others, and never really expecting anything back from anyone,” Pardue said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid delays in construction of the new location of Felipe’s, a popular late night Mexican restaurant, students and Cambridge residents can satisfy their burrito cravings at Flat Patties, where Felipe’s will operate until the grand opening of its new home at 21 Brattle St.
Felipe’s had originally planned on moving into its new home in April, but Tom Brush, an owner of both Felipe’s and Flat Patties, a burger and fries joint at 33 Brattle St., said that unexpected delays will push the opening toward the middle or end of May. Felipe’s began serving at Flat Patties last week.
“There have been a number of little issues involving zoning, the roof deck, and liquor licenses,” Brush said. “I had not anticipated this amount of time but it’s just part of the process.”
However, even with a delayed opening, the restaurant may still lack the liquor license that Brush is seeking.
“We have a [liquor] licensing hearing on the 22nd of April, but Felipe’s has always been about the food and we are not concerned. While we would love to open with a beer and wine license, it’s unlikely that we will,” Brush said. “I would say a liquor license will probably be a good six months down the road.”
Until the opening, Felipe’s will continue to operate out of Flat Patties. Brush said the continuity of the business, both for customers and employees, is a priority during this time.
“We’ve had lots of people in and we do a lot of catering as well, so it’s helpful to keep it going,” Brush said. “Employee retention and customer retention, it’s really important for us to keep a presence and not just shut down.”
Although Flat Patties is half the square footage of the former location of Felipe’s, Brush said there is a full commercial kitchen in the basement that allows for a separate Felipe’s cooking line including ovens, griddles, and fryers.
“When you include the square footage of the basement, it is comparable in size to the old Felipe’s,” Brush said. “It’s a very congested situation but it’s working, and the staff has been very understanding and cooperative.”
Students who frequent the taqueria said that they are happy that they can still get their late-night Felipe’s fix even though the restaurant is transitioning locations.
“I think it’s a beneficial business strategy to still serve during their move,” Jamie S. Tanzer ’17 said.
Others note the confined quarters of the current situation but said they are still grateful for a chance to order their favorite burritos.
“I mean it’s nice that they’re still in business while they’re moving stores,” Christopher J. Holthouse ’15, a self-proclaimed Felipe’s enthusiast, said. “It’s a little cramped in there, but as an interim solution it’s really great that they’re still open.”

Entertainment lawyer, author, and Harvard Law School graduate Bertram Fields has donated $5 million to the Law School to endow a professorship in his name, the school announced last week.
Fields, a co-founder and partner of the law firm Greenberg Glusker in Los Angeles, has represented a range of clients, including DreamWorks, MGM, Tom Cruise, The Beatles, and Tom Clancy.
After earning his bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1949, Fields graduated magna cum laude from the Law School in 1952. He characterizes his time as an editor for the Harvard Law Review as a contributor to his professional success, according to a press release from the school.
“Harvard is an institution that over the centuries has contributed enormously to American thought, especially judicial thought,” Fields said in the school’s statement. “It changed my life dramatically and had a fundamental impact on me and my career.”
Upon graduation from the Law School, Fields served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, and, in 1959, he co-founded Greenberg Glusker, which now employs approximately 100 attorneys.
Fields teaches an entertainment law course at Stanford Law School and has often lectured at Harvard Law School. In addition to his legal work, he has published two novels and a biographical work on Richard III.
“Bert Fields is legendary because he sets the standard for excellence and creativity as a litigator, teacher, and author,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said in the school’s statement. “It is with joy that we announce this superb expression of his generosity and vision.”

Four days after Secretary of State John F. Kerry called for a “reality check” on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, former director of the CIA David H. Petraeus and Meir Dagan, former director of Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, analyzed the prospects for future peace in the Middle East at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday.
The panelists agreed that a sustainable resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still some time away. Dagan began the conversation by asserting his opinion that the Palestinians are unwilling to make any immediate compromises, a result of what he calls the “legacy of [Yasser] Arafat.”
Dagan said that creating peace between Israel and Palestine requires more than just agreement between the two states.  For a lasting settlement, he said, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan, and other surrounding countries would have to come to an agreement about the rights to holy places in the region that are important to both the Jewish and Muslim religions.
“It’s not something like sitting around the table and solving the problem. It’s much more complicated,” Dagan said.
According to Petraeus, the once widely held Israeli view that the current situation is not sustainable has become less prevalent due to Israel’s strengthening security forces. Petraeus said that Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, border walls, and security checkpoints have shielded Israel from many of the attacks and suicide bombers that were a daily occurrence a decade ago.
“I’m not so sure the status-quo from Israel’s perspective is not sustainable. You have now the best security that Israel has had in a number of years, if not longer,” Petraeus, who is now a senior fellow at the Belfer Center, said.
Dagan and Petraeus agreed that although increased security measures could allow the status-quo to be sustainable, it is not preferable.
“There is a real desire from both sides to reach eventually a peace agreement,” Dagan said.
Graham T. Allison ’62, the Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School, moderated the forum and described it as “a historic occasion” bringing together two “genuine legends, dedicated heroes, warriors, and serious strategic thinkers.”
The event’s attendance was one of the largest of the semester. The Forum filled up completely prior to the 6 p.m. start, forcing several attendees to stand along the back walls. Former President of Mexico Felipe Calderón, who was an IOP fellow in 2013, was among those in attendance.
According to Nathan R. Betcher, a student at the Kennedy School, the two former generals left many questions unanswered and failed to get to the crux of the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
“There are fundamental limitations of course that were left with regard to what the actual concessions would be from both sides in coming to a sustainable, two-state solution,” Betcher said.

Cherry Murray, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, joined the board of directors for Newport Corporation,a technology company that specializes in providing hardware for photonics and optics research, last week.
The news was announced last Wednesday in a press release issued by the company. According to Charles F. Cargile, the Chief Financial Officer of Newport, the company began the process of searching for new board members over a year ago after the company’s mandatory retirement age required two of the current board members to step down after this May.
According to Cargile, Murray’s tenure officially began when the announcement was made. As part of her duties as a board member, Murray will be required to attend a quarterly board meeting, with the next one being this May.
However, Cargile said, a board member’s responsibilities are not limited to simply attending meetings. “It’s expected that each board member will do their homework,” he said in a phone interview Monday.
One of the reasons Newport reached out to Murray, Cargile said, was because “it’s very important for Newport to have good insight into university programs.” Cargile added that around a quarter of Newport’s business derives from selling hardware to university and government-funded labs around the world.
“All the components that make up a laser are sold by Newport,” Cargile said, adding that he was certain that some Harvard labs purchase their laser equipment from the company.
According to an email from Paul Karoff, communications director for SEAS, Newport Corporation is the only for-profit board that Murray serves on. She has also served as a board member for several scientific organizations in the past, including the National Academy of Sciences Council and Executive Board and the American Association for the Advancement of Science Board.
Murray is not the only Harvard administrator to serve on a company’s board. University President Drew G. Faust has served as a board member for Staples since early 2012, and Nitin Nohria, dean of Harvard Business School, serves on the advisory board of Piramal Realty, a real estate company based in Mumbai. In addition, David Ellwood, dean of Harvard Kennedy School, serves on the board of Abt Associates, a government and business research consulting firm.
Cargile said that Newport Corporation was “excited” to have Murray on board, saying that “we did a very thorough review process… Dr. Murray was such a good fit.”
Murray declined to comment for this article.

UPDATED: April 9, 2014, at 1:54 a.m.
Four months after his arrest for allegedly engineering a bomb hoax on Harvard’s campus, Quincy House sophomore Eldo Kim has still yet to be indicted by a grand jury.
Allison D. Burroughs, Kim’s private counsel, declined to comment on the proceedings of the case, which began with a federal complaint on Dec. 17, 2013 alleging that Kim sent several emails saying he had placed bombs in two campus buildings. The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and the case’s electronic court record has not changed since Dec. 23.
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 mandates that a suspect be indicted within 30 days of arrest.
Yet, according to legal experts, a variety of pretrial delays can extend that timeframe, sometimes to a great extent.
Alex Whiting, a professor of the practice of criminal prosecution at Harvard Law School, said that the defense and the U.S. Attorney’s office may be working to settle the case without a trial.
“If a trial has not reached a grand jury, that suggests that there are discussions between the defense and the prosecution about a resolution of the case, which I would expect anyhow,” Whiting said. “Those discussions may result in resolution, or they may not, but it’s no surprise that there would be ongoing discussions.”
However, Jeffrey A. Denner, founder of the Massachusetts firm J A Denner Criminal Defense Group, cautioned that the arrest was recent enough that no conclusion can be drawn from the delay.
“I do not know whether negotiations are going on,” Denner said.  “Normally the defense lawyer and the U.S. attorney talk.  Talking doesn’t mean they’re negotiating.”
Denner also pointed out that the delay may be caused by the U.S. Attorney’s need to gather more evidence, rather than by negotiations.
According to an affidavit filed by an FBI agent in December, Kim confessed to making the Dec. 16 bomb threat—which was sent to the Harvard University Police Department, University administrators, and the president of The Crimson—to avoid a final examination.
“Normally, it’s not the defendant that’s slowing the indictment process down, it’s the U.S. Attorney’s office,” Denner said.
Like Whiting, Kari E. Hong, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School and a criminal appeals attorney, said that she suspects the defendant’s counsel is in negotiation with the prosecution.
“A good criminal defense trial attorney will be on the phone with the prosecutor on day one, trying to negotiate,” she said. “Over 95 percent of cases are resolved by plea, so the earlier that happens, the better. I tell my students, the very best defense attorney is someone who is on very good terms with the prosecution.”
If convicted under the federal bomb hoax statute, Kim could be sentenced to up to five years of imprisonment, three years of probationary release, and a $250,000 fine.
Still, Whiting said that a variety of reasons could motivate the U.S. Attorney’s Office to negotiate a lesser penalty.
“I would expect the office to take into account all the different factors—the effect on the community, the resources that were diverted as a result of the event—but also all the particular circumstances of the defendant: his motivations, whatever they can learn about his psychological state at the time, and whatever circumstances he found himself in,” Whiting said.
Kim’s alleged threats led to a lockdown of the four campus buildings mentioned in the threat and restriction of access to Harvard Yard. University, local, state, and federal law enforcement personnel searched for five hours before ultimately determining the threat was not credible.
The University has previously said it will not comment on the criminal proceedings. According to Kim’s former roommate at Harvard, Daniel P. Leichus ’16, Kim returned to campus within the first week of his arrest to claim his belongings. In December, a federal judge mandated that Kim remain in Massachusetts pending trial.

UPDATED: April 8, 2014, at 11:55 p.m.
Institute of Politics Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 will step down from his current position on June 30. Grayson announced his plans to return to his home state of Kentucky following the end of the academic year in a letter posted on the IOP website Tuesday.
Grayson cited his responsibility to his two daughters in the fifth and eighth grade as his main impetus for resigning. He said he has no immediate plans to run for a future political position.
“I’m not in a hurry running for politics,” Grayson said, adding that he may have an interest in continuing his political career after his daughters leave for college.
Grayson was elected Kentucky's Secretary of State in November 2003 at the age of 31, becoming the youngest in the nation to hold the position at the time. After losing to Rand H. Paul in the 2010 GOP Senate primary in Kentucky, Grayson accepted the position of IOP director at his alma mater. Grayson has served as the IOP’s director since his appointment in January 2011.
As an undergraduate at the College, Grayson was involved in IOP student leadership. He helped organize forum events and participated in study groups, eventually rising to the position of vice chair of the student advisory committee.
“The IOP was a big part of my life,” Grayson said. “I spent a lot of time here, going to events, organizing events—15 to 20 hours a week during the semester.”
Grayson has engaged with students during his tenure in a number of settings beyond the IOP—as a freshman advisor, a faculty fellow for the men’s basketball team, and a member of the Kirkland House Senior Common Room.
Students who have worked with Grayson agreed that his commitment to engaging with undergraduates directly correlated to his success at the IOP.
“I think that Trey, for someone as accomplished as he is, is unbelievably, remarkably easy to talk to,” President of the IOP Eva A. Guidarini ’15 said. “He’s incredibly friendly, he’s incredibly engaged, [and] he’s always involved.”
Harleen K. Gambhir ’14, who has served on the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee since her freshman year, has seen Grayson interact and mentor students since he was hired in 2011.
“He provided this really great role model of showing [students] that it was possible to be a student and to be at the place that they are and go on to take an active part in public life,” Gambhir said.
Although Grayson will be leaving his position of interacting with undergraduates, he hopes to continue influencing others.
“I do have an interest in trying to figure out how I can continue to make whatever community it is where I live, or the country, a better place,” Grayson said. “Even if I end up in a private sector type of job, I want to be a community leader, or a statewide leader, or whatever.”
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 cited the push for use of digital media, expansion of internship programs, boosted attention to the IOP’s young voter polling project, and growing student interest in IOP programming as elements of the legacy Grayson will leave at the IOP.
“His enthusiasm and devotion have been invaluable to the IOP and the Kennedy School, and I wish him well in his next endeavor,” Ellwood wrote in an email to the Kennedy School community.
Ellwood also announced that a selection committee will immediately begin the process of identifying a successor.

UPDATED: April 9, 2014, at 12:14 p.m.
Waiting in line for a coffee in the Science Center, Ben D. Sprung-Keyser ’15 decided to check the email that had popped up on his phone before heading to math office hours.
“I thought it would be another boring email from a house mailing list,” he said. But, as he walked away with his coffee, he stopped in his tracks when he saw that it was a message informing him of his election to Phi Beta Kappa. Upon returning to his dorm, the surprises continued—Alexander L. Jaffe ’15, his roommate and friend since middle school, had also been elected to the organization.
The two roommates make up one twelfth of Phi Beta Kappa’s “Junior 24”—the first 24 members of the Class of 2015 to be elected to the organization’s Harvard chapter.
“The Junior 24 are among a highly select group of students recognized for extraordinary academic achievement,” wrote Jeffrey M. Berg, an assistant director at Harvard’s Postgraduate and National Fellowships Office, in an email announcing the selection on behalf of the chapter. Students who were selected for the honor were privately notified prior to the public announcement.
Inductees were sitting on shuttles to the Quad, doing homework in libraries and dining halls, and walking to practice and class, but all said that they were surprised by their acceptance message. Many were relieved that the wait for an answer was over.
“I was certainly flustered and did not expect it at all,” Dominic Ferrante ’15 said. “It is a great honor.”
Many juniors admitted to the organization attributed their success to a true passion for the subjects that they pursue, although they noted that every student’s academic path is unique.
“Like many students, I work hard because I love it,” Viviana M. Hanley ’15 said of her pursuits in philosophy. “It is a wonderful environment, and I enjoy the pure intellectual curiosity.”
Many inductees also credited their success to the breadth of subjects and interests that their concentrations’ departments offer. Some had a clear idea of the concentration they wanted to pursue at Harvard, but most said that they came to their concentration after studying a wide range of subjects.
“I was able to experiment with subjects and with a lot of classes due to the flexibility of the Social Studies concentration,” Daniel E. Backman ’15 said. “I pursued things that I wanted to pursue.”
Thirteen of the 24 juniors came from just four departments: Mathematics, Psychology, Economics, and Social Studies. Four inductees concentrate in Mathematics, making it the most represented department in the group of juniors admitted to PBK.
Math Department Chair Benedict H. Gross ’71 wrote in an email  that this was “not unusual,” noting that the department attracts many strong students.
Inductee and psychology concentrator Katharine D. D'Orazio ’15 said that the Psychology Department offers “small seminars and great interactions with professors even if it is a pretty large department.”
Sprung-Keyser, an economics concentrator, noted that the Economics Department was “particularly good at offering an enormous range of classes, allowing students to find a good niche in economics.”
The 24 juniors inducted into the society were Samuel E. Sokolsky-Tifft, Viviana M. Hanley, Yong Jin Wang, Brandon E. Brier, Katharine D. D’Orazio, Leah P. Gaffney, Seo Yeon Kim, Evan M. O’Dorney, Dominic Ferrante, Aleksandar A. Makelov, Alexander L. Jaffe, Gregory D. Kristof, Ben D. Sprung-Keyser, Joshua W. Pfeffer, Daniel E. Backman, Brian L. Cronin, Dylan V. Neel, Elsa B. Kania, Richard Y. Liu, Aaron N. Cheng, Marco Y. Gentili, Ian D. Lundberg, Gabrielle E. Milner, and Rachel S. Wong.

One of the biggest indicators of success for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team this season has been faceoff percentage. In the Crimson’s wins this season, the team has won 55% of its faceoffs, compared to only 40% in its losses.
In Harvard’s Mar. 31 loss to then third-ranked Duke, the Crimson (6-4, 3-0 Ivy) only managed to secure 10 of 31 faceoffs, a major factor in the Blue Devil’s 17-11 victory.
But when Harvard faced No. 2 Cornell on Saturday at Schoellkopf Field, faceoff specialist Gabriel Mendola refused to let history repeat itself. The senior midfielder helped secure 20 of 26 faceoffs and led his team to arguably one of the biggest wins in program history, snapping a nine-game losing streak to the Big Red. With the victory, Harvard retains sole possession of first place in the Ivy League.
Cornell came into the game only allowing opponents to win 44% of faceoff draws, but Mendola put up a 77% conversion rate for the contest.
“Duke really took it to us on faceoffs,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We were disappointed, but this week we really regrouped and practiced hard on the draw to do better this time.”
For Mendola, this was more than just any game. The senior grew up only a mile away from Cornell and was a lifelong Big Red supporter before donning his Crimson uniform.
“All my friends and family were there,” Mendola said. “And it really helped me to play my best lacrosse. It was sort of a dream come true to come home and play like that. My friends and family have seen us lose to them every year that I’ve been at Harvard, but this time, we just said as a team that we knew we could do it and had to prove it.”
In lacrosse, it is often difficult for a single player to truly dictate the flow of the game from a traditional field position. However, if a team is able to dominate the faceoff battle, the entire contest is turned on its head. Winning possession after possession is both invigorating for an offense and grueling for a defense.
The momentum translates rapidly into more goals, and defensive mistakes are mitigated.
Mendola provided that offensive spark for the Crimson, dominating the faceoff battle. The senior also finished the game with 10 individual groundball pickups, eight more than the next-highest individual total for the Crimson and five more than any Big Red player.
“Gabe really stepped up,” Wojcik said. “It means a lot to give our defense a chance to rest and really keep the pressure on our opponents after goals. He really was the biggest difference maker for us.”
Harvard won the game during the second and third quarters, winning those two frames by a combined 9-3 goal margin. During that time, Mendola provided an offensive spark by going 11-14 for the Crimson.
“We have seen what happens when we aren’t able to win faceoffs and don’t get the ball,” said Harvard co-captain and senior midfielder Peter Schwartz. “It is huge for us as an offense to get those extra possessions, and it allows us to get into a better flow and put points on the board.”
On Saturday, the Crimson lost nearly every statistical battle. The team had lower save and shooting percentages, conceded more turnovers, and went only 1-6 on extra-man chances. Discounting the faceoff-related ground ball pickups, the Crimson could have also lost that battle by a wide margin.
But thanks to Mendola’s efforts, those concessions never mattered. While Cornell was more efficient than Harvard with its shots and saves, the Crimson was able to take almost twice as many shots as the Big Red. By dominating possession, Harvard was able to effectively overwhelm the Cornell defense and secure the upset victory.
Mendola was, of course, not alone in his success. There are two components to dominating the faceoff battle: the faceoff specialist himself, but also the wing players who fight to secure the ball after the initial confrontation.
“We had great wingplay on Saturday,” Mendola said. “Whenever I couldn’t get it myself, I could always get it out to Brian Fischer or Keegan Michel or whatever short-stick midfielder was there.”
Mendola did not start the season as Harvard’s primary faceoff midfielder. In the first three games this year, he only took 12 of 69 faceoffs. The Crimson lost the faceoff battle in each of those games. Since then, Mendola has taken 135 of 186 faceoffs, winning 76 of them for a 56% success rate.
“He’s developed a lot of confidence and continued to work really hard throughout the season,” Wojcik said. “We’ve seen him make a lot of progress throughout the year, and it really materialized for us on Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 17 Harvard sailing team sent boats out to three regattas across the northeast this weekend. The Crimson came back to Cambridge with a fifth-place finish and another top-10 result, as Harvard concluded the team racing portion of its spring season.
65TH FOWLE TROPHY
Connecticut College hosted 12 teams at the site of this year’s New England Team Race Championship. The Crimson finished middle of the pack with a sixth-place showing at the conference championship regatta. The top four teams—Roger Williams, Yale, Boston College, and Tufts—each qualified for the ICSA Team Racing Nationals.
“Obviously [we] didn’t get the result that we have been training for—a berth at Team Race Nationals,” junior Michael Drumm said. “But we sailed pretty well against tough competition. We did a good job [of] not making too many stupid mistakes that plagued some other teams, and did a pretty good job at staying calm after some tough races that didn’t go our way.”
Six other sailors from Harvard joined Drumm on the Thames River. The Crimson finished the weekend with a 7-9 record in the round robin spread.
“Our starts were a definite weakness in our game,” Drumm said. “Unfortunately, our starts were not very good when we were sailing against good teams, which made the rest of the race very difficult, since we were trying to catch up the entire time instead of making plays.”
Despite failing to qualify for nationals, the Crimson still has positives to take away from the Fowle Trophy.
“Our team recognized that a main area of our game that needed improvement was the execution of maneuvers,” Drumm said. “We worked on that a lot going into this regatta, and the practice definitely helped. Our team did many things correctly this weekend, but just like many other teams, we also made a few mistakes.”
EMILY WICK TROPHY
Teams across different sectionals met down at the Coast Guard Academy, but it was Ivy League rival Yale that took home the win while the Crimson finished second-to-last with a 17th place result.
Sailing 420s, Harvard senior Caitlin Watson and sophomore Kristina Jacobson took 14th in the A division. Sophomore Sophie Bermudez, and freshman Julia Lord teamed up for the B division, finishing in 17th place.
Conditions were less than ideal until mid-afternoon on Sunday. The wind was unpredictable, forcing the course to change throughout the day on Saturday and raising the bar for all teams on the water.
4TH MYSTIC LAKE TEAM RACE
The Crimson’s strongest performance of the weekend was the Mystic Lake Team Race, hosted by Tufts. The home-squad Jumbos took first place, finishing with a perfect 18-0 record, while Harvard finished in fifth place with a record of 10-8.
“I think the weekend went very well considering the goals we had at this regatta,” Matthew Mollerus said. “Going into the regatta, we were expecting it to be hard to be consistent given how shifty the Tufts venue can be. We found this to be very true, although we succeeded at adapting to the conditions, forcing us to be very clean with our execution, and we got much better at that as the weekend went on.”
Similar to the Fowle regatta, the freshman believed the team’s greatest weakness on the water was with the starts.
“We often shot ourselves in the foot with subpar beginnings and were fighting from behind for the rest of the race,” Mollerus said.
Fortunately for the Crimson, mental acuity was working in its favor.
“Our strength was our ability to recognize what was the best move at any given time,” Mollerus said. “With the conditions being so unstable, the play changed rapidly and unpredictably, and we won many races because we were able to recognize what had happened before the other team.”
With the close of team racing, the Crimson’s season transitions now to feel racing, where one boat represents each college in match-ups that will bring up to 18 teams together competing in longer races.
“Overall, although we didn’t get the result we worked for, we will continue training hard to get better,” Drumm said. “After a few weeks of regattas we will have the opportunity to qualify for fleet race nationals.”

UPDATED: April 8, 2014, at 7:45 p.m.
Eight years ago, on February 2, 2006, The Harvard Crimson published an unreasonably long, rather boring, but cleverly titled article, “The Skinny on Harvard’s Rare Book Collection.” The exposé revealed the identities of three rare books covered in human skin. Get it? Skinny. Skin-ny. HA. I almost chuckled a little.
Well, the truth is, at least one of these three books is not covered in human skin. They’re covered in skin, alright, just not human skin. Sheep skin. Yeah, some scientists performed some tests and discovered that one of these valuable volumes is bound not in the skin of our fellow man, but in the skin of our not-so-fellow sheep. At least they’re mammals, right? You were close, Samuel P. Jacobs '09.
Science: 1, Clever Headlines: 0.
However, it should be stated that this discovery doesn’t discount the fact that there may have been human-sheep chimera. You know, back in the day.
At the end of it all, there is definitely a moral to this story. Don’t judge a book by its cover—or what you think that cover is made of.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 8, 2014
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the number of books previously believed to be covered in human skin that were proven instead to be bound in sheep skin. In fact, scientists have thus far only shown that one of the three books is covered in sheep skin.

We all know the story: boy goes to Harvard, boy makes popular social media site, boy drops out of Harvard and goes on to become one of the world’s youngest billionaires. But there’s a plot twist!
 Years later, boy makes a welcome video for the Class of 2018, encouraging them to go to Harvard. Boy goes on to say that he hopes the admitted students “will stay a bit longer than I did.”
So why exactly is Mark E. Zuckerberg going to such great lengths to convince the students to actually graduate? Admitted student Federico Roitman thinks Zuckerberg did it to get the class excited for Harvard. “I think he wanted to show the class that there are a lot of opportunities at Harvard,” says Roitman. Others seemed quite skeptical of Zuckerberg’s intentions. “I wasn’t aware that he was still affiliated with or connected with Harvard,” says Elizabeth F. Koch, “I guess it shows that he did leave on good terms.”
These poor kids don’t know just how wrong they are.
Zuckerberg didn’t make this video to get students excited about college. He made it because he feels threatened by the 5.9 percent. Everyone dreams of being dubbed “most popular dropout,” but it seems that Zuckerberg is reluctant to give up the title he stole from William H. Gates III. So he’s going to continue making these videos and winning over the hearts of prefrosh until every last student graduates. The nerve!
  Nice try, Zuckerberg, but we’ve figured you out.
