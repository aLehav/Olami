After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

There was a lot of buzz for Kelela’s 2013 mixtape “Cut 4 Me” and 2015’s EP “Hallucinogen,” the latter of which made three Billboard weekly charts. Just last fall, the R&B-electronica artist released her first studio album called “Take Me Apart.” The album has received critical praise for its technical precision and lyrical intimacy. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Kelela about her new album, R&B music, and her approach to songwriting and live performance.
The Harvard Crimson: “Take Me Apart” is about romantic experience, and all of the emotional and physical vulnerability that comes with it. What inspired you to base your debut album on this theme?
Kelela: I don’t know if that’s my process, really. It’s more like I’m living my life, and the way that I get through my experiences in order to feel better about them is by writing songs. I just write about what’s going on with me—and a lot of times, [what’s] going on in the forefront of our experience are interpersonal relationships. And a lot of times, those are romantic. It’s [more about] how I’m evolving as a person, in relationship to other people. That’s more how it feels inside me.
THC: Do you have a creative process that you follow when it comes to making your music?
K: I’m usually just listening to either chords or just sounds, and responding to them with melody. So it starts [out] being melodic, and then I go from there to start trying to fit lyric into the phrasing of my melody.
THC: You’ve cited Janet Jackson’s sound as a major influence for “Take Me Apart.” Could you tell me more about her influence on your artistry?
K: I think the intersection of really rich musicality, rich harmony, soulful melody… and also on the production side, there being a lot of weight in terms of the sound… [is] sort of that one-two punch that I think I find to be most inspiring. And then obviously, as a performer, she’s just incredible. But I think the music itself is where I fixated, as an artist.
THC: Many critics have described your music as “innovative” and “futuristic.” What is your reaction to “Take Me Apart” being viewed as a redefinition of R&B?
K: The subtext there is that I think that there’s some music that people think of as inherently innovative, inherently futuristic, inherently advanced, and inherently complex and layered. And usually that’s attributed to white people’s work. When it comes to black people’s work, [the work] is still valued, but it’s seen as intuitive, just sort of coming straight out of the person—more rudimentary and less complex, less intentional.
So the subtext any time [someone] puts “innovative” in front of R&B is that people think of R&B as basic. And I think that it’s essentially racist… so it’s one of those things that’s problematic. It doesn’t reflexively make me feel happy. But I also appreciate that people are appreciating it. I will just always be reflexively pointing to the tradition and [to the] people who came before me who have been innovating, who have been making [R&B] weird and cool and new and making it feel layered.
THC: What can concertgoers expect from your upcoming shows?
K: When it comes to these shows that are coming up, I’m always trying to innovate my own set and my own music. I’m trying to make new versions of my songs. I’m always trying to present people with something that they haven’t seen—even if you’ve gone to every single Kelela show, there’s an experience to be had at the next one that’s different from the last. I know I was just [there] in October or November, so for me, it’s really important that the people who come to every show have a reason to come to the next, and the next, and the next, because they’re constantly chasing an unknown experience. That’s something that I’m always trying to create.
Kelela is playing at the Royale in Boston on Feb. 26. “Take Me Apart” is out now via Warp Records.

Hollywood has a long way to go with representation, but “Black Panther” is an active move to bring more people of color onto the big screen. Even when black artists star as the leads in movies, those films usually don’t become popular in a mainstream way. Because of the systemic underrepresentation of black actors and characters, “black cinema” tends to get pigeonholed as its own subgenre, as opposed to attracting a wider audience’s attention. This also stems from a lack of black writers in the industry, according to an IndieWire study conducted last November. Most of the recognition black actors receive in Hollywood comes in the form of movies about black struggle, which limits the scope of black stories. At the same time, year after year, superhero movies become large blockbuster successes, with most of them centered around white male leads. “Black Panther” proves that Afrocentric narratives can be both cinematically meritorious and attract mainstream popularity, changing the landscape for black representation in cinema in a particularly influential way—which has been particularly influential—especially for black children.
Of course, “Black Panther” isn’t the only black superhero film, but it is the top grossing blockbuster film with a black cast. The film features not only a black lead, but also a mostly black cast, which sets a new standard for superhero films, in which black characters have been historically sidelined for white narratives. The actors’ cultural identities represent a wide range of African nations and its diaspora, from Guyana (Letitia Wright) to Kenya (Lupita Nyong’o), broadening the scope of representation to more than just black Americans.
Another important feature of the black cast is the inclusion of dark-skinned black women, who are typically left out in Hollywood due to colorism and European beauty standards. Black women superheroes are so rare in the superhero film world—the most famous of whom is Storm, an X-Men character whose ability to control the weather stems from her heritage as an African witch-priestess. Storm is typically played by lighter-skinned black women, like Halle Berry, despite being portrayed as dark-skinned in most of her comics. “Black Panther” producer Nate Moore called Shuri (Letitia Wright), T’Challa’s younger sister, the “smartest person” in the Marvel Comics Universe. The image of a black female teenager usurping Tony Stark in intelligence widens the scope of what a black character can be, empowering the representation of black women.
Not only is the cast black, but the writing team is black too. Generally speaking, even when characters in movies are black, they are usually not written by black writers, which can perpetuate black stereotypes that limit the multidimensionality of black characters. Black writers are typically left out of the creative process, but for “Black Panther,” they were front and center with Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, two black men, writing the story of T’Challa.
Coogler and Cole’s writing works to subvert the trope that stereotypes Africa as a destitute continent. The movie is set in Wakanda, the most advanced African nation of its time. Typically, a Western worldview imagines Africa as a monolith, a continent rife with poverty and social unrest. History has conceptualized Western nations as superpowers, leaving African nations with these tired stereotypes. Given this history, the location and prominence of Wakanda does not go unnoticed. “Black Panther” shows an African nation more advanced than any other country on earth.
For black children, having superheroes with the same skin color as them emphasizes the implications of representation: that children find their superheroes accessible and relatable. People view superheroes as characters that should be admired because they have good morals and protect people. Children grow up wanting to be superheroes, and now they can see one of African descent portrayed on the big screen. In anticipation of “Black Panther”’s release, people bought tickets for black youth to go see the movie. Celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres and Octavia Spencer started fundraisers for tickets to the movie for black youth, just so they could have a superhero to look up to. Serena Williams, in particular, surprised a group of girls from Black Girls CODE (further bolstering the character Shuri’s narrative of intelligent black women) with a paid-for screening of the film.
To me, “Black Panther” represents the beauty of black actors and writers coming together to create a film that black children can look up to. When this movie was first announced, I didn’t realize its necessity until I noticed how few black superhero movies have garnered the same mainstream attention. But now, we see dark-skinned black women fighting and protecting the nation of Wakanda. Seeing “Black Panther” on the screen reminds me of when I first saw Tiana in “The Princess and the Frog,” the first black Disney princess. Seeing Tiana on the screen made me feel like Disney was writing me into the movie. I watched the movie dozens of times and I even checked which Disney theme park would have Tiana available to take pictures. She had my skin color, hair, and Southern accent. I connected with her as a child because she looked just like me. “Black Panther” represents another influential movie in which black children can see themselves when they look at the big screen and see T’Challa fight villains and protect his nation.

On Kendrick Lamar’s curated album, “Black Panther: The Album,” Lamar and other featured artists paint a picture of struggle, despair, and ultimate triumph. Lamar and his fellow artists rap and sing over a set of instrumentals—Afrobreat-esque sounds, jam-packed with drums, flutes, and a plethora of other instruments—that are refreshingly unique from typical western rap. This combination of sounds set the stage for the movie “Black Panther,” for which this soundtrack was made, as the movie takes place in the African, albeit fictional, country of Wakanda. The album’s production, in conjunction with the powerful lyrics woven throughout many of the tracks, make for a solid artistic endeavor by Kendrick Lamar.
The very first song on this album, entitled, “Black Panther,” largely falls flat, but the trajectory goes up from there. On “Black Panther,” Lamar opens the album with a smooth piano melody, but soon introduces new instruments that clash chaotically. The cacophony felt like the producers were trying a bit too hard in their noteworthy endeavor to add an African spin on the track. Despite the musical shortcomings of this song, the lyrics still pack a punch, like when he says, “What do you stand for? Are you a activist? What are your city plans for? / Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?” Lamar challenges his listeners to stand up for what they believe not just with their words, but with their actions. Standing up for one’s people becomes a motif prominent not just on this track, but throughout the album.
In other songs, however, the risk of incorporating unique instrumentation into the production pays off. At several moments, the production greatly bolstered the lyrics. From using African instruments in the majority of the songs, to singing and rapping on several tracks in Zulu, a South African language, “X,”  “Redemption,” and “Seasons,” the producers’ contribution to the listener’s experience shined as much as the lyricists’.
However, this is not to shortchange the lyricists’ efforts. The lyrics are consistently both powerful and cohesive despite the album featuring a plethora of different rappers and singers who address social issues prominent in the black community: Their words strengthen the quality of the album. In “Seasons,” Lamar’s colleagues share their grievances against the American justice system, which holds unfair obstacles for people of color. In “Seasons,” Mozzy raps about issues in low-income black communities, saying, “They wasn’t teachin’ nothin’, it’s no secret / whole lotta crime, lil n***** beefing’ / we gotta keep it or end up a victim / trapped in a system, traffickin’ drugs / modern-day slavery, African thugs / we go to war for this African blood.” Mozzy argues that black oppression is systemic, as the government’s failure to ensure education in low-income black communities pushes young men to turn to other, illegal, ways of gaining monetary success. He implies that due to a lack of options, many black individuals are pushed to crime, which often culminates in their being “locked-up,” or shackled like slaves. Similarly, Reason subsequently raps that “we locked in the system / catch a case and they not gon’ forgive ya / white skin, you be out before Christmas.” He voices his discontent with the fact that black people have historically been punished with harsher sentences when they commit the same type of crimes as their white counterparts. In the final track of the album, “Pray For Me,” The Weeknd says, “Who gon’ pray for me? / Take my pain for me? / Save my soul for me? / ‘Cause I’m alone, you see,” indicating that people of color often feel abandoned by the government due to the aforementioned shortcomings.
However, lyrics that emphasize black power and perseverance balance out these grief-laden stanzas. On the very same track, in which The Weeknd laments his loneliness, in “Pray For Me” Lamar says, “who need a hero? / You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero,” illustrating black people’s need and ability to provide for themselves. On “Paramedic!” rapper Slimmy B says, “Yeah I had to man up, one fist in the air / I ain’t finna put my hands up,” juxtaposing the well-known image of black people being forced by police to put their hands in the air with the uplifting symbol of black power. In the following verse, rapper Yhung T.O. frankly says, “They ain’t wanna see me win ‘cause I’m black / so I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back,” illustrating his refusal to let any racial inequities in the justice system stop him from profiting. Interestingly, during this one phrase, the music in the background cuts out, allowing the listeners to hear his message without distraction. In many ways, that line embodies the whole album, as it signifies black struggle and the ultimate power of black people to overcome great obstacles.
Throughout the 14 songs on this album, Kendrick and his fellow artists maintained these motifs of struggle and perseverance. One of the major strengths of this piece was its ability to uphold the overall tone of the album from beginning to end. The theme of Black Power in this album made it an appropriate backdrop for the film for which it was made. Though this album was created for a fictional movie, the messages woven throughout, accentuated by the production, were very real, making it yet another successful accolade for Kendrick Lamar.

It seemed appropriate that an offensive rebound off of a missed free throw would help seal Harvard women’s basketball’s 55-52 home win over two-time defending Ivy League champions Penn.
Just a week after the very same type of play caused a heartbreaking loss against Yale, sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm snagged a missed free throw with 30 seconds remaining, helping the Crimson (15-9, 7-4 Ivy) break a nine-game losing streak to Penn (17-7, 8-3), and extend their run of victories at the renovated Lavietes Pavilion to 11 games.
Harvard had revenge on its mind after a thorough 80-47 defeat at the Palestra at the hands of the Quakers. Entering the weekend locked into a three-way tie with Yale and Dartmouth for just two spots at the Ivy League tournament, the matchup with Penn granted an opportunity for the team to separate itself from the Big Green and Bulldogs.
With the Crimson leading by three, junior guard Sydney Skinner headed to the line for two free throws, the clock with just over half of a minute to play. Nailing the first, she missed the second, but Boehm, a sub-40 percent free throw shooter, was able to alertly wrest the rebound free, and intelligently pass the ball out to sophomore guard Katie Benzan, who was fouled and converted both free throws.
The stroke of brilliance on Boehm’s part seemingly put the game out of reach, with the home team leading by five points, but the Quakers would not relent. Senior guard Anna Ross proceeded to drain several three pointers, and force a jump ball to give Penn possession with eight seconds remaining.
Ross would have one last shot—with the visitors down three—but the Syracuse, N.Y., native’s effort fell well short as time expired. As the buzzer rang out the Crimson jubilantly stormed the court, celebrating its first win over the women from Philadelphia in five seasons.
“Being senior weekend was enough motivation by itself,” senior guard Kirby Porter said of Friday night’s matchup. “It meant a lot to everyone on the team, there was a lot of good energy out there.”
Penn entered the 2017-2018 season as two time defending Ancient Eight champions, winning the league crown three of the four past seasons. The Quakers were led by senior center Michelle Nwokedi, who had come up big in the team’s 11 road games, in which Penn posted an impressive 8-3 record.
While Nwokedi entered the contest averaging a modest 12 points per game, she began the season as the defending Ivy League Player of the Year, given to the conference’s most outstanding player. The Missouri City, Texas, native scored a season-high 30 points against the Crimson in the first meeting between the two teams. This week, limiting Nwokedi was paramount to Harvard’s success.
Boehm and freshman Jadyn Bush—anchors of the team’s frontcourt play—came up huge, limiting Nwokedi to a mere six points on just 3-13 shooting. The interior tandem, along with senior guard Taylor Rooks, combined for 23 rebounds, helping ward off the visitors.
“I’m very proud of the consistent effort on the defensive end and rebounding,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It’s a huge step for us.”
Perhaps the most impressive part of Friday night’s win was the depth that the Crimson demonstrated. Scoring fixtures Benzan and junior co-captain guard Madeline Raster combined to shoot just 2-19 from the field, and just 1-10 from beyond the arc, scoring only seven points between the pair.
Rooks, playing in her final home weekend of her collegiate career, stepped up huge in lieu of the of the aforementioned duo, registering a monster 21-point, 12-rebound double double. The effort was enough to give the team the boost they needed to extend its Lavietes Pavilion win streak
“It speaks to our depth, the ability of everyone on the team to step up when they needed do,” said Porter of Harvard’s win, accomplished without the scoring typically registered by Benzan and Raster. “I thought Taylor Rooks did an amazing job tonight, I think that’s that senior pride in her, stepping up and helping us secure a win.”
The first half was a back and forth affair, with the Crimson leaping out to a 27-12 lead, on the coattails of 15 points from Rooks. The senior outscored the entire Quakers’ team for much of the first quarter, and sparked Harvard to a 13-2 run.
But Penn demonstrated that its two consecutive Ancient Eight championships were no fluke. With poise and resilience on the road, the visitors battled back behind a 16-4 streak, cut the halftime deficit to just three and the score to 31-28 at the intermission.
In previous games, the Quakers’ run, combined with their pedigree, might have been enough to put the Crimson away. However, with the season on the line for Harvard, the team fought back. Despite only scoring 19 total points between the second and third quarters, in stark contrast to its 22 first quarter points, the team entered the final period of play knotted up at 41 with the defending champions.
From there, the team’s grit took over, rallying to give seniors Rooks and Porter their first career win over Penn in their final opportunity to break the five-year streak of losses.
“I thought Kirby and Taylor Rooks played like seniors tonight,” Delaney-Smith said. “All the intangible things, all the blue collar work, it’s what you look for from a senior that wants to help us make this happen. I’m most proud of those two.”
Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the night was that the young Crimson team could hang with the defending champs, overcome its largest loss of the season—a 33-point beatdown—and beat the very same team two weeks later.
“I hope that this is that demon off our back now,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were playing the name of the school, rather than the bodies in the shirt. I think tonight we proved that we can do what we want if we work hard.”
With the conference tournament looming in two weeks’ time, Delaney-Smith and Harvard hope that tonight’s win was a sign of things to come, a catalyst for the remainder of the season. The win was a measure of the team’s resolve, of its depth, of its balance, even without Raster and Benzan’s contributions.
For the Crimson to make it to Philadelphia—and perhaps even to the NCAA Tournament—it will need team efforts like tonight. The scrap and to grit on display tonight in Lavietes prove that the team can take down the very best of the Ancient Eight conference.

Take the Harvard men’s hockey team, which had found its groove over the last week and was firing on all cylinders. Add back its Olympian for good measure. Put this team in Providence, R.I., to face a Brown squad that has hovered near the bottom of the ECAC all season. This is the recipe for an easy two points, right? Not exactly.
On Friday night, the Crimson (13-11-4, 11-7-3 ECAC) followed all those steps in a chippy, fast-paced fight against the Bears (7-17-4, 6-14-1), only to unravel in a 6-4 loss. The crowd could almost pretend it was Feb. 2007, because that was the last time Harvard conceded six goals to Brown—that game ended in a tie.
Special teams ruled the day, and the return of junior Ryan Donato from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics could not stave off a hat trick from Bears alternate captain Sam Lafferty.
“All the way across the board, I think we need to be better,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “We helped them beat [us], and that’s never a good sign.”
With the bench boss’s son back in the forward mix, the lines underwent some shuffling. In an effort to preserve last weekend’s successful top six, sophomore Ty Pelton-Byce and freshman Jack Badini retained both their centerman duties and their linemates but were bumped down a rung in the lineup. This allowed for tri-captain Jake Horton to center the top line, with Donato playing left wing for the first time all season. Junior goaltender Michael Lackey was given the nod this time.
“It was just a little bit of an adjustment,” the younger Donato said. “I played right wing [in the Olympics].... It felt good to be on the wing and I enjoyed it, but I like playing center just as much.”
With three minutes to play in regulation and down 6-3, Harvard pulled Lackey in hopes of cutting Brown’s lead. With the extra skater on, the Crimson did indeed manage to do that.
Sophomore defenseman John Marino fed Donato at the blue line for a hard shot that Bears rookie Luke Kania was able to shrug off. But Pelton-Byce and junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage were both causing chaos in the slot. As the puck bounced off Kania, Pelton-Byce chipped it right into the net. The Madison, Wis., native has logged at least a point (3–4—7) in each of the six consecutive games he’s played at center.
“We’re searching for the right combinations,” said coach Donato, when asked if Pelton-Byce’s recent play has given him more flexibility with the lineup. “[We’re looking for] guys that are going to pay attention to the details and play with certain elements to their game that allow us to have success.”
Harvard’s fourth goal inched the team closer to Brown, but the comeback effort ultimately fell short. The Crimson was chasing the Bears all game after the home team came out firing in the first, outshooting the visitors, 14-10. Brown led, 1-0, after the first intermission, breaking the ice against Harvard for the first time since Nov. 7, 2015.
The Crimson’s misfortunes continued to start the second. A rare misplay at the point from sophomore defenseman Adam Fox sent Bears sophomore Trey Dodd off to the races to score a shorthanded tally low glove-side on Lackey. The disjointed power play unit was looking more and more like the team that, two weeks ago, could not execute on 17 straight man-advantage opportunities.
In the very next 5-on-4, though, Badini drove to the net and cashed in on his own rebound to break the ice for Harvard. Not long after, Zerter-Gossage suffered a knee-on-knee collision while the Crimson was already up a man, handing the visitors a two-man advantage.
A pretty passing play between Zerter-Gossage and Pelton-Byce found freshman point-man Reilly Walsh, well-positioned in the low slot, who chipped the puck over the glove of Kania. Harvard had closed the gap, and the game was tied, 2-2.
“In the second period we kind of found our stride a little bit,” coach Donato said. “[We] got the game to 2-2. But we weren’t really able to perform at a high enough level in any facet of the game.”
The middle frame was not without its antics, as shoving escalated to cross-checking behind the Crimson net. Senior blue-liner Wiley Sherman found himself in the middle of a heated scrum after cross-checking senior Tim Lappin into the boards. Both teams sat for incidental roughing penalties, and Sherman was assessed the additional boarding infraction.
“We took some bad penalties, some retaliatory penalties,” coach Donato said. “Penalties that we were in control of, not penalties where we were defending and we were desperate and had to take one.”
The final period contained the same chippiness, as tallies by Brown captain Josh McArdle and Lafferty pulled the home team ahead. A visibly frustrated Harvard team could do little but watch as Lafferty found his legs for two more quick strikes in the frame. Donato’s goal, the Crimson’s third of the night and his team-leading 22nd, was in effect cancelled out by the Bears offense.
On a night that soured quickly, perhaps the only positive for Harvard is the continued production of its power play unit. Three of Friday’s four goals came on the man-advantage, and the fourth goal came with the extra skater on. The Crimson has now cashed in on 10 of its last 17 opportunities (58.82%), dramatically reversing the trend from late-January’s dry spell. Still, the team had some crucial chances to take the lead against Brown where it fell short.
“We could’ve scored a couple more times,” the younger Donato said. “Sometimes the puck bounces in the wrong direction, but we shot as much as we could. The key is to retrieve a couple more pucks.”
After a shutout performance last week against St. Lawrence, Lackey’s game between the pipes also left something to be desired. The junior turned away 23 of the 29 shots he faced. If the team hopes to make postseason run, its goaltending will have to be nothing short of stellar through the ECAC playoffs. Coach Donato would not commit to any particular net-minder, but tri-captain Merrick Madsen could see ice time in Saturday’s tilt with Yale after a strong performance last weekend against Clarkson.

The Harvard men's hockey team (13-11-4, 11-7-3 ECAC) heads to New Haven, Conn. for the last game of the 2017-2018 regular season. After last night's disappointing 6-4 finish to Brown and a crushing 5-2 loss to Yale early on in the year, the Crimson will look to cap off tonight with a payback win.
One team stands between Harvard and the ECAC bye week, though. Yale (14-13-1, 9-11-1 ECAC) hosts the Crimson on its senior night, and will not go down without a battle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — Harvard and Yale possess one of the oldest and most storied rivalries in all of sports. Tens of thousands of alumni from all over the world are invested in their beloved Crimson or Bulldogs and love nothing more than to see the opposition fall at the hands of their alma mater.
On Saturday night, someone quite new to this clash helped define its latest chapter. Freshman forward Kevin O’Neil potted both goals for Yale (15-13-1, 10-11-1 ECAC), powering the Elis to a 2-1 victory.
“We had plenty of opportunities in front of the net where we just seemed to not be able to find a loose puck or win a stick battle,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[In] the third, we had the better of chances, they made a great individual play, and we weren’t able to get the equalizer.”
O’Neil’s second goal of the night came with just three minutes remaining in the bout, giving the Crimson (13-12-4, 11-8-3) little time to mount a comeback.
The Latham, N.Y., native stepped across the blue line with the puck, toe-dragged around Harvard rearguard Wiley Sherman, and slipped a backhander through the legs of tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen.
Technical difficulties with the scoreboard only intensified the  Crimson’s uphill battle, as the PA announcer was the team’s sole lifeline for clock updates during most of the third period.
“It’s a little frustrating because you don’t really have a sense of the exact time of the game,” admitted coach Donato after the game. “We had a clock on the bench, and we were trying to figure it out, but we never really were accurate…. What are you going to do?”
Until early in final frame, when Harvard freshman Henry Bowlby evened the score at 1-1 with a five-hole goal of his own, it looked like the contest might be decided by O’Neil’s first tally all the way back in the first period. But Bowlby’s timely equalizer breathed new life into the tilt, which had fallen into a bit of a lull after a scoreless middle third.
Following a neutral-zone faceoff the Edina, Minn., native picked up the puck and strode into the offensive zone, where he delicately threaded a shot between the wickets of Yale sophomore goaltender Corbin Kaczperski.
“He’s a gamebreaker, speed-wise,” said coach Donato of Bowlby. “He can go by you, he takes pucks to the net. He had one tonight, just missed on another one. As we head into the most important time of the season now, we’re going to need contributions from different guys, and he’s certainly been able to step up in key moments.”
Despite the dramatic third-period goals, the net-minders shined in an unusually low-scoring game between the two teams. Prior to the bout, the squads combined for 30 goals in their four most recent matchups, making a habit of turning the games into track meets. Thus, the 2-1 final ledger more closely resembled a first-period intermission report between the Harvard and Yale teams of late.
Kaczperski (33 SV, .971 SV%) made his first career start against the Crimson after entering Friday’s crucial loss to Dartmouth in relief—junior starter Sam Tucker allowed five scores on just 11 shots faced before being yanked. Getting the nod from coach Keith Allain on Saturday, the 6’3” tender did not squander the opportunity to start such a meaningful rivalry game.
Staring all the way down the ice at Kaczperski was the Crimson’s own puck-fielder. Madsen’s performance (28 SV, .933 SV%) was not exactly shabby either.
“Their guy made some key saves with some good opportunities,” coach Donato lauded. “I thought Merrick made some key saves as well…. I didn’t think that we allowed a ton of grade-A chances, honestly.”
Kaczperski particularly impressed in his successful effort to stymie a red-hot Harvard power play. The Crimson’s man advantage has been as much a boon as it has a bane at times this season. In late January, Harvard endured 17 straight fruitless attempts, but this trend quickly reversed, as coach Donato’s squad entered the tilt having notched multiple man-up goals in each of its previous four games.
At the Whale on Saturday night, though, the power play proved to be closer to the bane side of the spectrum—and in no small part due to Kaczperski’s stingy play. The Crimson sent its extra-man unit onto the ice six times, but each time the group returned to the bench empty-handed.
“[The power play] had some good chances, good looks,” said Bowlby, who did not see power play ice time on Saturday. “It just didn’t come together, and we just couldn’t finish tonight. Overall, the power play has been good lately, and hopefully that can fuel us in the playoffs.”
For the second time this season, Yale started the scoring in the rivalry matchup. Most of the first period had elapsed before O’Neil gathered his own rebound and flicked the puck over Madsen’s shoulder to find twine.
The rookie also tallied against the Crimson in the teams’ first meeting of 2017-2018. O’Neil, who has scored three of his six goals this season against Harvard, clearly knows the importance of these games and has performed accordingly.
Before O’Neil inked the scoresheet, the contest saw limited chances both ways as the teams felt each other out. After all, the two storied rivals had not faced off since the first weekend of November, and plenty has changed since then.
Back when Yale handed Harvard its first loss of the season, the Crimson sat at No. 3 in the country. Now, after suffering its final loss of the campaign to the same Bulldogs squad, Harvard enters the postseason unranked and with little to no hope of an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Thus, winning the ECAC playoff title is the team’s golden ticket.
As this season has shown, circumstances do change over the course of the campaign. But the intensity of the Harvard-Yale matchup seems to be a mainstay.
“It’s probably the biggest rivalry I’ve ever played in, [and] it’s really fun getting ready for the games,” said Bowlby, before looking ahead to future clashes with the Bulldogs. “We’re 0-2 against Yale now, so we’re definitely going to have to come out better in our next [three] years here.”
Saturday night’s loss to Yale marks the first time since the 2014-2015 season that the Crimson has suffered a regular-season sweep at the hands of the Elis.
Harvard now heads into its bye week hoping to rest its banged-up players, iron out the lines, and decide on a number-one goaltender for the playoffs.

On Feb.16, patrons flocked to the Institute of Contemporary Art for a special evening showing of “The Square,” an Oscar-nominated Swedish film starring Claes Bang and Elisabeth Moss. It is a satirical take on managing a contemporary art museum much like the ICA. While many of the audience members went into the film not knowing much about its content or quality, most, if not all, of them left profoundly affected and pleased that the ICA provides opportunities to see content like “The Square.”
Leslie J. Carter and Michael G. Lindquind, audience members
RR: What did you think of the movie?
LJC: I thought it was interesting. I didn’t really come into it knowing what to expect.
MGL: Yeah, I was expecting awkwardness. I saw his other film. It was very good, and it had a very similar vibe—really crisp aesthetics but a lot of awkward situations. I liked it. I feel like I’m still processing it.
LJC : It definitely plays on on our reactions and emotions.
RR: Have you guys seen any of the other Oscar-nominated films?
MGL: I saw “Call Me By Your Name.” I think that’s nominated for an Oscar.
LJC: I saw “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” I just saw that yesterday.
MGL: Did you like it?
LJC: Yes, definitely. It’s disturbing and, you know, not the best sides of humanity.
Jenna L. Pollack, audience member
RR: What did you think about “The Square?”
JLP: I am still processing, and yet my immediate reaction is that it was gratuitous and uncomfortable to the point of not accomplishing anything.RR: Have you seen any other Oscar-nominated films?
JLP: I have not, but when the film ended I immediately turned to my friend, and said that I needed to shower, and I couldn’t believe that was nominated for an Oscar.
RR: What made you uncomfortable?
JLP: I thought it played into tropes of contemporary art, of Swedish people, and of racism on a very surface level. The way that it was put together through extended durations that seemed to have no narrative purpose made it seem more random than intentional, and not in a way, to me, again, that seemed to accomplish anything meaningful.Elizabeth M. Epsen and Adam M. Friedman, audience members
RR: What did you think about “The Square?”
EME: I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was very original and really funny. I thought the acting was fantastic and that they did a really great job at capturing relatable contemporary art pitfalls that we all have seen before. I liked that they kept pushing this idea of image and presenting. It satirized this thesis of equality and helping and this criticism of society for not doing enough and not being there. The statement that society has to do more is very common, but it is a wash statement that can be put out there because it doesn’t really go anywhere.
RR:  Do you have a background in contemporary art?
EME: I love contemporary art. I’ve worked in contemporary art museums before, so I was familiar with the artists they were referring to. I’ve worked at a museum where the artists and galleries were just like the characters and scenes portrayed in “The Square.” The movie had a strong focus on current debate within the art community. What makes artwork artwork? Is it just the sight? “The Square” is like the gallery. That’s the sight of art. Anything that is inside the square, inside the gallery, is what is therefore relevant for us and is worth paying attention to. You saw the symbol of the square appearing throughout the whole movie—the video on his phone, his daughter’s cheerleading tournament, the spot where the beggar placed his cup. You see it as the falsities of empty discourse. This curator believes so passionately in this thesis of dignity and equality for all in the square. However, you see him in his daily life, and he’s being totally thoughtless. Yet, he’s an interesting complex character. There’s so much in the character that the audience related to.
RR: How did the ending affect your perception?
EME: I thought it was interesting how children were holding him accountable for his moral actions. It was the little boy and his own daughters who were witnessing him in his worst moments. They were not impressed. Only children are able to see things for what they really are—to see through this empty rhetoric. He couldn’t pull the wool over their eyes like he did with everyone else. RR: Do you think movie nights are a great way to get people involved in the ICA?
EME: Sure. What was so great about this film showing is that it was making fun of contemporary art in a contemporary art museum. It was the ICA saying “Hey, we’re not taking ourselves too seriously. We know there’s a lot on the gallery places and website programs that sound like nonsense and are inaccessible.”
RR: Is there anything you wanted to say about the film, Adam?
AMF: I endorse her analysis.
