After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Don’t Worry Darling” had everything going for it. The script sent studios into a bidding war over acquiring the follow up to Olivia Wilde’s widely praised directorial debut “Booksmart.” Anticipation only grew as Oscar-nominated actress Florence Pugh and Grammy-winning pop sensation Harry Styles were tapped to star in the project. News outlets and fans alike went as far as calling the film an early favorite for the 2022 Oscars. But much like the film’s idyllic setting in the fictional utopian town Victory, things aren’t always as they initially appear.
While “Don’t Worry Darling” has been a frequent flier on the Hollywood rumor mill, the press tour truly took a turn for the worst with the release of Variety’s cover story interview with Wilde. In the interview, Wilde spoke at length about her desire to show female pleasure in the film.
The comments came just days after Pugh criticized the film’s marketing push, which has centered the sex scenes between Pugh and Styles, telling Harper’s Bazaar “When it’s reduced to your sex scenes, or to watch the most famous man in the world go down on someone, it’s not why we do it.” Fans were quick to point out that Pugh has avoided posting about the film on social media and is largely absent from the film's press tour, missing both the Venice press conference and the upcoming New York premiere.
But the fallout from Wilde’s interview didn’t end there. Wilde also spoke about Shia LaBeouf, initially tapped to play Jack Chambers before being replaced by Styles, who abruptly departed from the project in 2020. While the studio initially cited scheduling conflicts, Wilde told Variety that she fired LaBeouf from the project because his process was “not conducive” to her goal of making Pugh feel safe and supported. LaBeouf was notably sued for Sexual Battery by his ex-girlfriend FKA Twigs just months later.
LaBeouf quickly responded to Wilde’s comments, sharing emails, texts, and videos with Variety that allegedly confirmed he was not fired from the project but chose to leave. Screenshots also featured conversations that suggested Pugh and LaBeouf seemed to be on good terms. A video LaBeouf shared with Variety showed Wilde asking LaBeouf to stay on the project, saying this could be “a wake up call for Miss Flo” in reference to his co-star.
With the film’s reputation already in flames and a legion of movie buffs and Styles's fans breaking down every moment of its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, memes and gaffes were predestined for virality. From Styles’s riveting interview answers — “My favorite thing about the movie is that it feels like a movie” — to Chris Pine’s quickly memed reactions during interviews, the saga quickly transcended from Twitter topic of the day to mainstream pop culture fixation.
Every moment of the premiere has been assessed and picked over by internet fanbases. Shots of the cast seated at the premiere spread online last week, showing Gemma Chan and Chris Pine appearing to be uncomfortable buffers between Wilde, Styles, and Pugh. Meanwhile, a video of Styles allegedly spitting on Pine gained enough traction that spokesmen for both actors formally came forward to deny the allegations. But the true peak of the night may have been a shady post from Pugh’s stylist captioned simply “Miss Flo,'' along with behind-the-scenes shots of her team in custom shirts bearing the same phrase.
The film itself is now overshadowed by the drama and controversy surrounding its production. It would take an audience reception akin to “The Godfather” to erase the deluge of media controversy tainting the film’s legacy. But based on the film's lukewarm reception among early critics, a behind-the-scenes tell-all may be in higher demand than the film itself.

“Ozark’s” highly anticipated final episodes hit Netflix in late April, and fans are still recovering. With 14 pending nominations, the departing series is currently feeling the Emmy love. But is the finale really worth all the awards buzz? The critically acclaimed Netflix series tells the story of the Byrdes, a middle-class family that launders money for a Mexican drug cartel. Known to spark controversy, “Ozark” questions the moral compasses of its characters and audience members alike, constantly blurring the line between decency and dishonesty, between good and bad. Some love the Byrdes; some hate the Byrdes; others feel sorry for them. However, one thing remains undisputed: “Ozark” is one of Netflix's biggest triumphs. But is it really its antihero narrative that makes this crime drama so compelling? After all, morally ambiguous characters have dominated the television landscape for decades.
According to starring actress Laura Linney, the central question of the show, and perhaps its most enticing one, can be traced back to a single word — identity. Working for a drug lord is not the safest career choice. Indeed it is this constant fight for survival that unearths the secrets, fears, and long-forgotten personality traits of its main characters. Just like that, family members turn into strangers. Granted, after three and a half seasons, viewers might think they finally know the Byrdes. But just as that wrongful assumption took hold, Netflix dropped its final season, and it was earth-shattering.
The last season of the Netflix show proceeded largely in “Ozark”-fashion — suspense, revenge, and death dominated the final episodes. Undoubtedly, the show remains one of the most intense and poignant television dramas to date. The storyline is overall riveting and exciting, though at times slightly confusing. There is no way around the fact that certain storylines are obsolete and repetitive. For example, there is simply no need for Mel Sattem (Adam Rothenberg), the private investigator, to return to the Ozarks to look into the whereabouts of yet another dead person. Furthermore, the cat-and-mouse game between Omar Navarro (Felix Solis) and his sister (Verónica Falcón) gets very old, very quickly.
The expanded 14-episode run paired with each episode’s one hour run time left the writers with a lot of time on their hands. Flashbacks attempt to fill that time, but fail to drive the story forward. At times, this season feels like an opportunity for the already deceased to return to the Ozarks to say their final goodbyes — an unusual sudden display of nostalgia. While disarming and slightly out of place, the flashbacks do pay tribute to all the phenomenal actors “Ozark” lured to Missouri — the closest thing to closure audience members can expect from a show that kills off its characters without remorse.
Nevertheless, the last season of “Ozark” is a must-see. Moving performances, imperfect relationships, and shocking deaths coin this piece of television artistry. The show’s final episodes powerfully allude to the danger of childhood trauma by further exploring Wendy’s upbringing — truly a highlight of the season. This storyline not only paves the way for stellar performances but also allows the audience to fathom the pain of childhood trauma through her interactions with her father. Wendy’s upbringing doesn’t justify her irrational behavior, but it does suggest that often bad people are deeply complex and flawed. Marty and Wendy’s relationship is often criticized; they are weighed down by the lust for power, the fear of death, and the struggle of trauma, but it is a relationship grounded in a prevailing love. Knowing this makes their interactions all the more devastating — and heartwarming. “I know I am not easy to love,” Wendy says, looking at Marty. After a pause, he replies: “That is not true.”
Granted, the final episode is not a happy ending. It might not be what viewers hoped for, but it is what feels true to the show and the characters. “Ozark” has repeatedly alluded to the inevitability of fate. Ruth Langmore’s death resembled a Shakespearean tragedy; there was a solemn sadness in the way her white dress slowly turned red. A death so tragic yet peaceful and maybe all along inevitable — as inevitable as the series’ ending? Jonah aims a shotgun at the investigator, who holds the cookie jar with Ben Davis's remains as the scene fades into black. Viewers never find out if Jonah pulls the trigger or not; instead, we are left with uncertainty. But looking back, the show never intended to provide its audience with straight forward answers. Did viewers really want to know what would ultimately happen to the Byrdes? There will always be someone who knows what the Byrdes did, even if it is only the Byrdes themselves. There is no end. No coda. No way out. Perhaps "Ozark" was never really about closure? Perhaps the show was simply about the journey of life. The journey of what we do, who we encounter, what we believe, and who we become.

This review contains mild spoilers for Episode One of “House of the Dragon.”
Imagine a land where dragons soar over a palatial red keep, where a young girl, queen by birthright and conquest, has mastered these beasts of the sky, and where family ties can bind and break a dynasty. This might sound straight out of “Game of Thrones,” HBO’s highly acclaimed epic fantasy TV show, and you would not be far off from thinking so. HBO has blessed all “Game of Thrones” fans with a brand-new spin-off following the Targaryen royals, set about 170 years before the start of the show.
“House of the Dragon” was highly anticipated due in part to the unsatisfying ending of “A Game of Thrones” and fans’ thirst to see more of Westeros and House Targaryen. The protagonist of “Game of Thrones” is Daenerys Targaryen, an exiled princess seeking justice and vengeance against the usurpers of her crown. In “House of the Dragon,” however, the Targaryens are at the height of their power: Dragons and silver-haired royals abound in King’s Landing, a thrilling contrast to Daenerys being the last of her kind in the original series.
While “Game of Thrones” was all about the power struggles between the noble houses of Westeros, “House of the Dragon” focuses on the political and personal clashes between various members of the House Targaryen. These conflicts will eventually leave their house permanently weakened as dragons and Targaryens alike perish, which George R. R. Martin — executive producer and author of “A Song of Ice and Fire,” the book series that inspired the show — deems the Dance of the Dragons. The show itself is based on Martin’s fictional historical narrative “Fire & Blood,” an epic chronicle of the Targaryens’ rise to power.
The source material for “House of the Dragon” differs from the “Game of Thrones” source material in two key ways. First, its arc is completed, which will hopefully save “House of the Dragon” from the same decrease in quality the original show suffered when writers were forced to go off-book. Secondly, the book is written as a historical narrative rather than an actual novel, giving the writers creative freedom to flesh out the dialogue and characters while having a definitive plot direction to ground the show and provide a path forward. To fans of the franchise and books, “House of the Dragon” may feel somewhat like a historical drama or political period piece, with all the magical elements and thrilling action scenes of epic fantasy.
The story begins with Prince Viserys, a younger grandson of the Old King Jaehaerys, chosen as his heir over Princess Rhaenys, who by birth order should succeed the Old King. The show is set around ten years after this event, following King Viserys’s only child Rhaenyra as the king defies precedent by crowning her as his heir over his younger brother Daemon.
Princess Rhaenyra’s character, already a dynamic personality in the books, is brought to life in the first episode as a headstrong, fearless child who rides dragons and firmly believes in her right to the throne despite her sex. A major theme of the show is women in power, with the young Rhaenyra as an obvious foil to the Queen Who Never Was, Princess Rhaenys. While this idea was always present in books, the transformation from historical narrative to HBO drama allows for deeper, more nuanced storytelling. Examples include the subtle rivalries between the two princesses, Viserys’s power over his wife Queen Aemma, and the heartbreaking scene where Viserys must decide whether having a male heir is worth losing the woman he loves. Viewers can feel the precariousness of Rhaenyra’s victory at end of the episode as she is crowned heir — not only does her empowerment hinge on her father’s whims, but her ambitious uncle and scheming courtiers loom with their own secret agendas.
Other details really bring the story to life, such as when Rhaenyra is made to light her mother’s pyre in a heartbreaking scene about duty and grief. One particularly compelling concept is the friendship between the young princess and Alicent Hightower, daughter of the Hand to the King. Seasoned fans of the books know that their friendship will eventually turn to bitter rivalry, and it was pleasantly surprising to see them as friends in the first episode (with some mild sapphic undertones), knowing the drama that lies ahead.
Without spoiling any of the historical narrative in “Fire & Blood,” show writers should avoid letting Princess Rhaenyra meet a similar fate to Daenerys. Many fans were deeply upset with the ending of “Game of Thrones” because they watched a beloved character and major female power player be written off as insane and killed off by show writers. For this show to follow the same pattern would not be a great look, and the writers are hopefully aware of this.
It is inevitable that “House of the Dragon” will always be compared to its incredibly popular predecessor, “Game of Thrones,” but its pilot episode suggests that the new series will be just as superb, with its dynamic characters, delicious drama, fantastical worldbuilding, and stunning sets. The casting is also perfect; each character looks straight out of the book, with a standout performance from Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen. Fans will be excited to return to the world of dragons and future queens every week after this show-stopping premiere.

On August 3, 2022, the Christian flag flew over the city of Boston.
The raising of the flag — a white banner with red Latin cross on a blue field in the upper hoist-side corner — was the culmination of a legal battle that started in 2017. Camp Constitution, a Christian organization, asked to fly their religious flag to commemorate America’s “Judeo-Christian heritage” on Constitution Day, using a flagpole the city normally uses to fly civilian flags upon request. Boston denied that request under the Establishment Clause, and, five years later, the Supreme Court ruled in Camp Constitution’s favor in Shurtleff v. City of Boston.
The flag only flew for two hours, but in that time it sent a clear message to the nonreligious and non-Christian communities in the city — that those who viewed their community as fundamentally Christian would always win out.
Liberty Counsel, the firm representing Camp Constitution, claimed viewpoint discrimination since the city denied the request not because of the content of the flag itself, but specifically because he described the flag as the “Christian flag.” The city’s refusal to fly his Christian flag while it had flown secular flags before (mostly other national flags to celebrate Boston’s diversity, but also flags commemorating celebrations like Pride Month and Juneteenth) was therefore just one more example of the government discriminating against religious people in the name of what Neil Gorsuch labeled the “so-called separation of church and state.”
To the petitioners’ credit, the commissioner in charge had never rejected a flag raising petition, and Boston had approved 284 in the last twelve years. But, the city had also never before flown a religious flag, and, believing that flying the cross outside city hall would constitute too much of an endorsement of one particular religion, the city denied the request.
The idea that Christianity is being discriminated against has become a prominent talking point of the religious right, who have used the “removal of God from the public square” as an explanation for school shootings to argue that a return to a Christian society would correct our societal trajectory. But for all their assertions that Christianity has become taboo, it is not a coincidence that the lone religious flag to fly over Boston was Christian, and I would argue that the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision for this Christian plaintiff says more about religion in the United States today than Boston’s rejection of the original petition. While regulations such as those enforced by the city are designed to protect all religious communities equally, Christianity is regularly prioritized across the country in ways that no other religion is prioritized.
Both Arkansas and Texas have monuments to the Ten Commandments at their state capitol buildings, and Oklahoma had one until 2015. Seven states mandate that public schools teach classes on the Bible. Governing bodies from town councils to state legislatures regularly open their sessions with disproportionately Christian prayers, and the professional chaplains of both chambers of Congress are Christian. Only Christians have ever held either role. And none of this mentions the fact that the Christian holiday of Christmas is the only religious holiday to have federal recognition. These, to me, are the visible, political manifestations of Christian Nationalism, an ahistorical movement which argues that the American identity is a fundamentally Christian identity.
Yet as many on the religious right no longer shy away from the term “Christian Nationalist,” even these displays of Christian dominance are not enough. They must be allowed to make the Bible their official state book, they must be allowed to lead students in prayer, they must be allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people while still receiving federal funds, and they must be allowed to drive the message home by flying the Christian flag from Boston City Hall.
To non-religious and minority religious communities, the argument that our society is declining because God is being “removed from the public square” is grounded in a visibly false premise. Christianity continues to be the default position in the United States, with Christians vastly overrepresented in Congress and the Supreme Court. The true shift in the United States surrounds conflating Christian morality with the law and Christianity with the government itself.
God has not been removed from the public square, but Christians can’t use the government to enforce the display of God. Christians can still pray in public, they just can’t coerce their students into doing it with them. Christians can still send their children to schools that discriminate against LGBTQ+ and nonreligious students and teachers, they just can’t demand that those schools receive federal funding in violation of nondiscrimination laws.
Or at the very least, they couldn’t. But one by one, these legal barriers between church and state are being undone, slowly but deliberately, thanks to a concerted effort on behalf of a small but critical minority of the Christian population. And one by one, these policy shifts are constructing a religious hierarchy completely detached from the diverse religious perspectives held by Americans and out of touch even with the religion practiced by most Christians.
This column, “The Free Exercise Thereof,” will examine this rising wave of Christian Nationalism and what it means for non-Christians like myself. Decisions like Shurtleff and the other cases that this column will investigate are part of a concerted effort to undermine the separation of church and state, and it is for that reason that acknowledging and addressing this existential threat should be our utmost constitutional priority.
Christianity has long held legal privilege in American society, but this new wave of Christian Nationalism is explicitly and dangerously reactionary. Camp Constitution did not feel the need to assert the country’s “Judeo-Christian heritage” in a vacuum. A small, reactionary subset of hardline Christians see the loss of absolute supremacy for Christianity in America’s religious landscape and view it as discrimination.
To them, the United States has always been a Christian nation. And for those two hours on August 3, their message came through loud and clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of an add-drop period that many students are treating as the shopping week they’ll never have again, the pressure to find classes that are simultaneously interesting, requirement-fulfilling, and chill enough for students to catch a breath is intense. With Harvard offering more than 3,700 courses in 50 different undergraduate fields of study, students here should have their pick of the litter of classes that satisfy their personal trifecta of interest, requirements, and acceptable workload. There are more than enough classes for every Harvard student to logistically achieve the well-rounded liberal arts and sciences education that the College so prides itself on delivering to students.
Yet in practice, few Harvard students pursue such a liberal arts and sciences education, even as the College encourages it with requirements and special programs. One such program is the General Education program, containing courses that, in the College’s words, “pose enduring questions” and “frame urgent problems.” Gen Ed courses have the greatest potential to be valuable and life-changing, investigating pressing issues that other courses may shy away from. But in truth, most students don’t treat Gen Eds like the College envisions. Students take easier courses or “gems,” like Gen Ed 1038: “Sleep” or Gen Ed 1074: “The Ancient Greek Hero,” purely to boost their GPA.
There is nothing inherently wrong with taking classes for one’s GPA. Students set on graduate school, medical school, or other avenues where their grades will be scrutinized for acceptance are entirely reasonable in their inclination towards “easy A” Gen Eds. But the fact that this attitude is shared by students whose futures are GPA-agnostic suggests that this is an institutional problem: that Harvard simply lacks dedication when it comes to supporting students’ intellectual curiosity and multidisciplinary learning. For a college that tells students to “venture into new territories and chart your own path,” a large percentage of students here seem to be venturing only in search of an additional one or two points to their grades.
Classes are the crux of a Harvard education; if they cannot instill a passion for learning in students, the entire education has failed in its mission of intellectual transformation. In order for Harvard to succeed in training the citizens and citizen-leaders of tomorrow, students and faculty must take two steps in tandem and bring academic passion back to the General Education program.
First, the College should require all Gen Ed courses to use pass-fail grading. If the main objective of these classes is for students to explore perspectives from other disciplines, why put extra strain on an already stressed-out college student juggling grades, extracurriculars, and recruiting? Students can’t be expected to prioritize broadening their horizons when faced with academic incentives that reward sticking to what they know. Currently, students can only take one of their four mandatory Gen Eds pass-fail. By moving all Gen Eds to pass-fail, students are nudged to grapple with personally intriguing questions in unfamiliar disciplines — instead of just finding the easiest class to pass.
Second, students must find for themselves the intrinsic value of learning. This requires significant self-reflection. As an Asian American child in a family of sticklers about grades, I empathize with students who still believe in the traditional definition of success in education as obtaining that coveted “A+” or scoring a perfect 100 percent on an exam. But you shouldn’t limit your perceptions of academic success to that number scale. College is a time to break boundaries, leave your comfort zone, and discover interests that will last a lifetime. It’s a limited four years where students all over the globe come together to innovate, obsess, and dive deeper into a multitude of unfamiliar subjects. Don’t waste your time taking a class that you know you won’t find intellectually stimulating — it only excludes you from academic fields you could’ve explored and novel ideas you could’ve learned.
Some might argue that making all Gen Eds pass-fail would only reinforce students’ definition of academic success as numeric grades: If Harvard students are only grade-driven, they would put no effort into their newly pass-fail Gen Eds, learning even less than before. That’s why both the pass-fail change and the intrinsic valuation of learning must happen together. If one happens without the other, students will either end up disillusioned about subjects they are passionate but inexperienced in, or discard their sense of intellectual curiosity altogether. The two proposed actions must be taken in tandem to ensure both student happiness and growth.
Attending one of the most rigorous and renowned colleges in the world is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As students at Harvard, we shouldn’t waste this opportunity out of fear of getting a low grade. College is a time for growth and an invitation to try something completely new. So learn about American food, acoustic engineering, East Asian cinema, or whatever else you find intellectually fascinating, and as long as you’re learning, don’t stress about a final grade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s campus is extremely vast — some of us are particularly aware of this when we must venture from the Quad to the SEC and back again. But sometimes, Harvard’s campus doesn’t feel quite big enough, like when the course taught by an alleged serial assaulter is listed as one of the options to fulfill your concentration requirements.
This fall, Professor John L. Comaroff returned to campus after a two-year administrative leave. A tenured professor in the Anthropology and African and African American Studies departments, Comaroff was accused of sexual misconduct during his time at Harvard as well as during his prior three-decade stint at the University of Chicago. Comaroff has also allegedly threatened students who warned others of his sexually inappropriate behavior — an issue central to the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard in which three graduate students argue that Harvard should be liable for ignoring Comaroff’s threats of retaliation against them.
Harvard has since filed a motion asking for this lawsuit to be dismissed. Last Wednesday, however, the Department of Justice filed an amicus brief arguing that the University could be liable for Comaroff’s threats to retaliate against the graduate student plaintiffs.
While we are not equipped to comment on the legal nuances of the amicus brief, as students, we are concerned by Comaroff’s return to campus and what this may mean for our community. Despite his two-year leave, the University’s lack of transparency surrounding any rehabilitative requirements for Comaroff’s return reflects only a superficial understanding of restorative justice and warrants our concerns that he may still be dangerous to our peers. We know we are not alone in this concern — during Comaroff’s first class on Tuesday, five graduate students walked out of his lecture in protest, while dozens of others gathered in the Science Center Plaza.
The administration must acknowledge and remedy the ways in which Comaroff’s return forces students into an unsafe learning environment. By allowing Comaroff to return as a teaching professor, Harvard sends the message that when it comes to academia, safety and well-being take a backseat to intellectual achievements and academic prominence.
Students should not have to find themselves between a rock and a hard place: taking a course with an alleged predator or rearranging their schedules to avoid any potential hazards. The burden of finding ways to feel safe in a classroom should not be placed on students’ shoulders.
Even if the University wasn’t liable for the harm done to students previously, it may certainly be held accountable for any potential harm done to students who are currently under the tutelage of a man accused of abusing those under his guidance. Indeed, this points to an even larger structural concern: The possibility that Harvard was aware (and even warned!) of accusations against Comaroff at the University of Chicago prior to his hiring in 2012 suggests problems in Harvard’s vetting process that warrant a closer look if the University is interested in preventing similar crises from arising in the future. As we have opined previously, the University should be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to Title IX protocols. Beyond the humiliation and confusion we feel while watching Harvard scramble every time a scandal breaks, it pains us to witness the harm done to community members in situations that could have been preempted.
It cannot be overstated how troubling it is that students, especially women, may not feel safe and comfortable within the classroom or even Harvard as a whole now that Comaroff has returned. No student should have to split their attention in the classroom between pursuits to satiate intellectual curiosity and fears for their physical and emotional safety. The classroom ought to be a sanctuary, not somewhere from which students need to seek refuge.

Days after finishing his role as Cambridge’s acting city manager, Owen O’Riordan has a new job in City Hall — right down the hall from his last one.
Cambridge’s newly-minted city manager, Yi-An Huang ’05, tapped O’Riordan to serve as acting deputy city manager, according to an email to city staff reported by Cambridge Day. O’Riordan, the head of the city’s Department of Public Works, served as acting city manager for two months over the summer before Huang took over.
The deputy city manager position has been empty since early 2021, when officeholder Lisa Peterson retired.
“I’ve been working with Owen very closely during the transition period,” Huang said in an interview last week prior to the announcement. “I’ve been really grateful for his openness.”
Huang took over as city manager on Sept. 6 after he was selected by the City Council to replace Louis A. DePasquale.
The city is currently searching for a chief of staff and a chief of strategy implementation, according to job postings on the city’s website. According to the job postings, the salary range for both jobs is between $160,000 and $200,000.
“We were able to meet and have good conversations about transition planning, where he was helping to bring me up to speed and to give me some of that organizational context and history,” Huang said of O’Riordan.
In a message to staff, Huang said the deputy city manager will have a more expansive and clarified role, according to Cambridge Day, writing that he views O’Riordan as the “chief operating officer for the city.” Huang said the deputy city manager will be responsible for “managing major day-to-day operations” and “overseeing core infrastructure,” according to Cambridge Day.
Huang said last week the city is facing staffing shortages, comparing the problem to ones he faced as a hospital executive.
“We’re facing the same staffing shortages that every hospital or health care provider is looking at as well,” he said.
Huang praised O’Riordan’s City Hall service in the memo to staff on Friday.
“Owen has performed wonderfully as the acting city manager over the summer and for many years as the commissioner of Public Works,” he wrote, according to Cambridge Day. “I’m grateful for his experience and leadership, and I’m excited to work with him in this new role.”

Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana praised the tenure of University President Lawrence S. Bacow in a Monday interview with The Crimson.
Khurana said Bacow, who is set to step down in June, has been a “great friend of Harvard College” over the past four years, citing his commitment to students and his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“He is someone who guided us with a steady hand through an extraordinarily difficult time, in addition to steadying the financial and administrative structures of the University during Covid,” said Khurana, who called Bacow a personal mentor.
Bacow and his wife Adele F. Bacow “devoted their lives to something bigger than themselves,” according to Khurana.
Khurana added that Bacow’s defense of international students during the pandemic was one of his “most powerful” moments as Harvard’s leader. Under Bacow’s administration, Harvard and MIT sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement over policies restricting international students from staying in the U.S. while attending universities that offered only online classes.
“He’s always stood up for our students,” Khurana said.
When asked about the type of leader he hopes will replace Bacow, Khurana declined to comment.
“The search committee is in the best position to answer that question,” he said. “But I hope they understand that I think Harvard College is the jewel of the University.”
Khurana also addressed the following topics in the interview:
Palestine Solidarity Committee Rally
A group of student protesters from the Palestine Solidarity Committee rallied during Convocation last month, chanting and displaying a poster that read, “Veritas? Here’s the real truth: Harvard Supports Israeli Apartheid.”
“Protest is one part of expression on our campus,” Khurana said. “In addition to creating space for protests, we also want to make sure that people who are here for an event also get a chance to hear the event in a way that is also free from interference.”
Khurana emphasized that students who share their perspectives with College administrators “will be heard” and “taken seriously.”
“One of the things that I really encourage always is our capacity to be open-minded, to listen to different perspectives, to think about our own perspectives and points of view,” he added.
Pakistan Fundraiser
The Harvard College Pakistani Students Association has called for donations and increased awareness for flood victims in Pakistan, criticizing administrators for their lack of public acknowledgment of the humanitarian crisis.
Khurana said his “heart goes out” to those affected by flooding in Pakistan, where a third of the country is underwater and almost 1,400 have died.
“My family is from that region — my parents were both born in Pakistan — so I know how devastating things like flooding can be,” Khurana said. “We really want to support our students and encourage students who are being impacted by this to reach out to their resident deans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council held its first regular meeting of the fall Monday night — the first to feature new city manager Yi-An Huang ’05.
During the meeting, the council approved nearly $16 million in state and local funding for Cambridge’s Affordable Housing Trust and nearly $4 million for “historic preservation and open space projects” under Massachusetts’s Community Preservation Act.
In an interview prior to the meeting, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said the transition to Huang’s leadership has been a “really exciting time” and that she was optimistic about his relationship with the council.
Huang and the council will go on a retreat to discuss issues raised by Cambridge residents during the city manager search process last spring, Mallon said. She described the discussion as “long overdue.”
Mallon added that Huang’s work during his onboarding “really affirmed the decision that we made as a city council to have Yi-An be our next city manager and really tackle some of these sort of thorny issues that we’ve been trying to work through for a long time.”
During Monday’s meeting, councilors, Huang, and city officials discussed monkeypox, and proposals to raise “linkage fees,” a fee paid by private developers toward the Affordable Housing Trust.
Cambridge’s chief public health officer, Derrick L. Neal, presented on the state of the Covid-19 pandemic and monkeypox in Cambridge, noting that the city had fewer than 10 cases of monkeypox. He urged Cambridge residents to get an updated booster vaccine to protect against the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and said those eligible to get the monkeypox vaccine should do so.
The council also passed a resolution on the August death of “legendary Cambridge resident” Peter Z. Valentine, an eccentric local artist who was known for speaking at council meetings on topics such as “metaphysical energies” and “cosmic awareness.”
“The joy and spirit and colorful essence of Peter reverberates,” Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 said during the meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former CNN chief media correspondent Brian P. Stelter, whose weekly show was canceled by the network last month, will join the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy as a fellow this semester.
Stelter, whose show was axed as part of a directional change brought by CNN’s new leadership, will serve as a Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy fellow, the Shorenstein Center announced Monday.
“I hope I can bring the spirit of my longtime Sunday morning TV show to Harvard’s campus,” Stelter wrote in an emailed statement Monday night. “Most of all, I hope I can convene discussions about media and democracy that will add value for students and the wider community.”
Stelter got his start in college when he founded the television news blog TVNewser, which he sold before becoming a media reporter for the New York Times. In 2013, he joined CNN as the host of “Reliable Sources,” its longtime Sunday morning media talk show.
The Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy fellowship invites “high-profile figures at the forefront of media, politics, and public policy” to the Kennedy School to collaborate with students and faculty members, according to the Shorenstein Center’s website.
“Given events of the past few years, it’s never been more important to explore and explain the forces that are shaping both our media and our political environment,” Shorenstein Center Director Nancy R. Gibbs wrote in a statement Monday. “With his long experience covering America’s newsrooms, their choices and their challenges, Brian will be a great resource for our students and scholars alike.”
At the Shorenstein Center, Stelter will “convene a series of discussions about threats to democracy and the range of potential responses from the news media,” according to the press release announcing his appointment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard launched a three-year research partnership with Amazon Web Services, the school announced in press release from its Office of Technology Development on Monday.
The partnership aims to promote research into quantum networking — a method of sending and receiving digital information — at the Harvard Quantum Initiative, according to the press release. It will increase funding for faculty-led projects and allow more students to get involved in research efforts.
“The collaborative initiative between AWS and Harvard will harness top research talent to explore quantum networking today and establish a framework to develop the quantum workforce of the future,” Antia Lamas-Linares, quantum networking lead at AWS, wrote in the press release.
Four faculty members — HQI Co-directors Evelyn L. Hu and Mikhail D. Lukin, Electrical Engineering professor Marko Lončar, and Chemistry professor Hongkun Park — will head the research projects included in the alliance with AWS.
Lukin told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that he believes Boston “plays a leading role” in quantum network research thanks to collaboration between academic institutions like Harvard and MIT and corporate partners.
“Initiatives of this kind — bridging cutting-edge academic research and leading industry partners — are critical to the emergent quantum industry and quantum ecosystem in the U.S. as a whole and in the Boston area specifically,” he said.
The emerging field of quantum networking holds immense promise in tackling “challenges of growing importance to our world, such as secure communication and powerful quantum computing clusters,” said Lamas-Linares, who will lead the Harvard-Amazon alliance.
The partnership follows Amazon’s announcement in June of its new AWS Center for Quantum Networking, which targets pressing scientific and engineering challenges through developing new quantum hardware, software, and applications.
In an increasingly digital world rife with threats to privacy and security, quantum networking may help enable secure communication and anonymity.
“Yet, for those aspirations to be realized, physicists, engineers, and materials scientists must overcome challenges to store, manipulate, repeat, and transmit quantum information over long distances,” the press release reads.
“By working together, academia and industry can accelerate discovery and technological progress,” Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in the press release. “Through this alliance with AWS, we will bring scientific scholarship and education to bear on some of the most exciting frontiers in quantum science.”

Sections
What do the first few weeks of school have in store for you? Look no further. Since we enjoy psychoanalyzing people and pretending the result has something to do with their birth month, here’s what the back-to-school season has in store for each of the zodiac signs (based on nothing but astrology TikTok and the aforementioned psychoanalyzed people).
Virgo
Welcome to Virgo season! We say in fear. A sun in Virgo, Mars in Gemini, and Jupiter in Aries will bring a boost of determination and confidence to our favorite overachievers. Maybe this will empower you to take six classes, instead of your normal five. We urge you to reconsider, though, and instead let the Pisces moon help you focus on developing your relationships. Misunderstandings may arise, but remember: a flexible attitude is the best approach. We know — it’s hard.
Libra
While this may sound blunt, it must be said: it is time for you to decide on your schedule. It’s normal to struggle when deciding on classes. It’s normal to sometimes regret the classes you chose. It’s not normal to add 20 classes to your Crimson Cart and repeatedly email your advisor to lift the add/drop hold. Mercury is currently in Libra, so this will be a busy time for you socially (as always, of course). However, with Mercury in retrograde later this month, plans might have to be reconsidered.
Scorpio 
Now’s the time to focus on relationships — that is, of the romantic kind. With the moon in Pisces, your love life will be brought to the forefront. So, sit next to your section crush. Be open to that beginning-of-semester fling. Leo season might have made you some more enemies, but everyone on BookTok (I got sidetracked) would agree that enemies-to-lovers is the best romantic trope.
Sagittarius 
What an exciting time of the year! Too bad you’re sick. Excessive socialization is not an excusable absence, so perhaps take some time to recuperate, if for only a couple days. When the momentum returns, capitalize on it: Mercury and Jupiter’s alignment may create space for self expression, passion, and connection. While we’ll love the energy, maybe try to cool it on the theatrics and exaggerations. (I’m a Sagittarius, so this is more a moment of self-reflection than anything.)
Capricorn 
Look at you getting back into your “school routine.” This may be a time of reinvigoration as you reorganize your space, rethink your beliefs, and revitalize your habits. Head to Paper Source to get that planner you’ve always wanted. Heck, start doing yoga in the morning. Now is the time to set healthy goals for yourself and your year (no pressure). With Venus in Virgo, you may be feeling an intellectual spark with others. Chances are you won’t find marriage material in Ec 1010, but a little crush is always fun.
Aquarius
You’ve started off the semester strong by completing your readings. You may not be able to keep that up, but everyone knows “not reading” is basically “skimming” is basically “reading.” Your schedule might be overbooked but just remember, you can’t be in two places at once. Sometimes, you can’t even be in one place at once (up for interpretation). Mars in Gemini may brew romance and creativity, and a moon in Pisces may help you realize what brings you comfort and security (sure, your dorm room gallery wall counts).
Pisces 
Oh Pisces. Sweet Pisces. You may still be unsure of your place this semester, especially socially. However, the moon in Pisces will bring a period of release and transformation. Following the full moon this month, make space for new possibilities and look forward to some exciting news or opportunities. Look at the beginning of this year as a fresh start. Go by a new nickname! Pick a new Instagram aesthetic! As long as these changes are authentic and bring you energy.
Aries 
You’re busy. You’re slaying. You’re turning heads confidently strutting to class. You’re making Sweetgreen-level bowls in the dhall. You’re blacking out on a Thursday? Just remember, we haven’t even had a full week of school yet. Some insecurities and fears may arise, but spending time with close ones will probably surely sort that out. If conflicts come up, stay true to yourself and be active and direct — Mercury retrograde can cause miscommunications.
Taurus
While you may be often reflecting on the past, you’re also focusing on the future. You may be growing into a new leadership position, managing new resources, and achieving your productivity goals. You’ve been staying grounded and carrying your friend group’s sanity for a while, and you deserve a break. Take a relaxing day: go for a walk, practice that instrument we all know you play, or start prepping your fall wardrobe. The vibes are good, and it looks like they will stay that way (knock on wood).
Gemini
You’re having a lovely time flirting with crushes, making section friends, and saying hi to everyone in the dhall again. As the invitations pile up, you may feel pulled between two groups or two paths. We have no advice — this just might happen. Later in the month, you may start to feel a sense of idleness or exhaustion, but don’t worry, you’re not entering your flop era. Rather, take some time to ground yourself before your most whimsical fantasies come true.
Leo
Have you dropped your first week of school Instagram post yet? If not, get on that! Everyone wants to see how glamorous college life has been for you so far. Venus in Virgo brings confidence, financial success, and sentimentality. Channel this by giving someone a nice handmade gift (bonus points if it’s me <3). While we love the confidence, it’s okay to admit when things do not go as expected. The first weeks of school are a hard adjustment for everyone. And, we’re sure you’re a pretty crier too.
Cancer
It seems as though you have not yet established your school routine (did it ever exist?). Remember: laundry should be done once a week, your bed should be made everyday, and you should not consume more than one scorpion bowl ever. No, not even after your professor cold-called you. With Venus connecting ;) with Uranus, your social life might be extra busy. There might even be time to have some novel experiences. We’ll admit it, we have no idea what Mercury retrograde actually means. However, it does seem like this time will bring some deep introspection. Maybe reconnect with your therapist in anticipation.
If you read this and related — cool! If you read this and didn’t relate — just you wait.
