After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
History shapes the way we reflect and reminisce. And so the way we look at history naturally carries equal weight in how we see ourselves.
Aldous L. Huxley, author of “Brave New World,” reminds us that the tendency of man to “not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons that history has to teach.” One of the most important factors that influences the emphasis we place on history is the academic environment in which we grow up. Therefore, in order for people to correctly learn history’s lessons, these academic environments must reflect history in a holistic way, putting as much emphasis on historical failures as successes.
In the United States, states have remarkable control and leeway over their own curricula and educational systems. This makes them instrumental in establishing academic environments, and as a result allows them to affect the weight with which entire populations consider certain aspects of history.
The open spectrum of emphasis that results—with academics settings placing different emphases on different historical moments—demonstrates the malleability of history. For example, while the Civil Rights Movement is widely covered in at least nine out of 12 states in the former Confederacy, 16 states require no instruction at all about the movement, despite its vital importance in history and the present.
But the perceived significance of the past does not just vary between states. My hometown of Birmingham, Ala., which served and continues to serve as the stage for many of the greatest victories and losses of the Civil Rights Movement, exemplifies these perceptual discrepancies. Between the Children’s Crusade, 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From a Birmingham Jail,” it was the epicenter of a battle that captivated a nation. This battle left scars that divided people with respect to which parts of Birmingham’s history are important to learn.
Acknowledgment of the weight of this history varies wildly from district to district—and even from class to class within individual schools. A couple of weekends ago, I went to the famed Birmingham Civil Rights Institute with a friend from my high school. Both of us were enthralled by the museum’s commitment to being a “living memorial with an ongoing mission,” dedicated not only to presenting an honest account of Alabama’s tumultuous history but also the way in which these struggles persist into today. Our shared enthrallment, though, stemmed from two very different backgrounds.
While the stories I encountered were no less moving than the first time I had learned about them, the effect of the museum was largely supplementary, lending nuance to a narrative I had already come to understand. Meanwhile, my friend's reaction was one of overwhelming shock as he saw the harsh reality of city’s history and the way it affects the present for the first time. Though lessons concerning Birmingham’s civil history were plentiful in both of our schools, the lessons at his served as a sort of historical false bottom through which the significance of many of the city’s stories was lost. Of course, it’d be unfair to assume that this difference was borne out of any kind of malice, but for whatever reason, it still exists and must therefore be addressed.
In many places in the South, the weight of history is only stressed when that history is positive. It is worrying that my friend was so stunned by the more reprehensible side of Birmingham’s history. In order to effectively learn from a past that appears as hauntingly temporally close as we’d like to believe it is ideologically distant, we need to acknowledge that some of the city’s ugliest stories can be some of its most important. Only in this way can we acknowledge the ways they can carry into the present, recognizing the persistence of Jim Crow and modern inequalities. As people learn about Southern identity, policymakers must take action to ensure that all of the South’s unpleasant stories carry as much weight as its pleasant ones.
The challenge of ensuring that history’s weight is carried forth through lessons is both universal and distinctly local, and the history of Alabama as well as Alabama public schools is only one such stage on which it is taking place. When it is met, however, students gain an invaluable platform to interact with the complex issues that form the foundation of their seemingly simple realities, able to recognize both historical successes and the places where work must continue. It is only through this concentrated effort that Huxley’s criticism can even hope to be avoided, as without it, history’s lessons don’t stand a chance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, I wrote a column in these pages on American liberalism with the hope of recovering some of the hidden gems of our collective political inheritance. Two experiences called me to that task.
The first was taking Dartmouth professor Russell Muirhead’s Harvard course on American political thought (anyone who hasn’t watched that man lecture on Hamiltonian “good administration” is sorely missing out). The second was stumbling upon footage from President Bill Clinton’s first inaugural: in particular, the famous line, “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”
Foolishly, I never broached the subject of American exceptionalism in my essays. The idea seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years, for several reasons. Many on the left (myself included at times) are uncomfortable with that phrase’s ambiguous links to nationalism: the appeal to America the bringer of democracy, the exporter of liberty to the not-yet-enlightened.
The notion of ‘exception’—and its frequent conflation with ‘exemption’—also provokes unease. We worry that some might misunderstand America’s exceptionalism as exempting it from the rules of international order. So the theory goes that America’s various foreign interventions—from Vietnam to Iraq—were the results of its inflated sense of self. Simply being America was license enough to impose our vision of justice on others.
That another sort of exceptionalism remains possible—one divorced from the chauvinism of “Make America Great Again”—seems lost on many. Hence the propensity toward slogans like “America Was Never Great,” “No Ban No Wall on Stolen Land” (a reference to President Donald Trump’s border wall), and the newer phenomenon of anti-Fourth of July celebrations.
These statements misunderstand the legacy of American democracy. We haven’t always been just a land-hungry empire, ready to enlist or dislodge outsiders. The American experiment has always been, in the phrase of Aziz F. Rana ’00, a matter of “two faces.”
On the one hand, it has been a game of projecting American power on those considered foreign, whether American Indian, Muslim, or Latino (to name just a few ‘others’). It has also, however, meant a genuine striving for organic democratic communities, embodied in the town-hall spirit of New England, the vivacity of local and national electoral contests, and the unceasing emphasis placed on the rituals of democracy: voting, phone-banking, canvassing, protesting.
This latter phenomenon I like to call effervescent democracy: the enthusiastic, voluntary involvement of private citizens in civic life. Despite the persistent problem of middling voter turnout, statistical metrics seem to confirm that our effervescent democracy is alive and well. A 2009 report from the Pew Research Center found that 63 percent of those polled had participated voluntarily in some aspect of civic life besides voting. From a voting-age pool of just under 235 million in 2010, that’s 148 million adults and mobilizing for civic participation—a figure of world-historical significance.
This democracy arose in tandem with the projection of American power but, though unseparated from the latter, is not precisely responsible for its faults.
The biggest mistake we could make in the Trump era would be to surrender this effervescent democracy—and the exceptional quality of American political life—to its worst mishandlers, especially as its ideas continually prove integral to the projects of social justice that animate so many progressives today.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old Democratic nominee from the Bronx who defeated the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, Representative Joe Crowley, in his tenth reelection bid, is one example, pushing for a federal jobs guarantee, strict regulation of Wall Street, and what she has called a “New Green Deal”—a plan to make the U.S. carbon-neutral by 2035. Her jobs guarantee reads like an homage to the Civilian Conservation Corps of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904. Ocasio-Cortez’s proposed banking regulations include recovering portions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. Her environmental strategy is even named to evoke the New Deal.
I would be surprised if we didn’t hear more echoes of the American populist and progressive movements in the coming years. The demographics behind those movements are the same ones agitating for change today.
Farmers in the 1880s accused the government of exacerbating rural hardship by preferring the interests of New York financiers. Today, these same citizens are demanding resolution to a long-unchecked opioid crisis. In the cities of the 1930s, concern abounded over slum-formation, social immobility, and corruption. Citizens today are mobilizing around these same concerns. Thankfully, we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.
What makes America exceptional is its trove of democratic movements and vocabularies: self-government, the sovereignty of the people, communitarian ethics—and protest and resistance in the absence of these. Ironically, it’s the movements that benefit the most from this inheritance that want the least to do with it.
I have to say, I admire a generation for reconsidering the significance of our exceptionalism. Especially in the Trump era, it seems well worth our time to reexamine the mythos of fireworks and declarations, if only to ensure our own good intentions.
Where I disagree with some is in what precisely of American history ought to be scrapped from celebration. Some seem to think our entire history is tarnished—a story of crimes committed and tracks covered.
My basic view is that there’s a lot worth saving.

The Dean of Students Office—which will oversee residential life, diversity and inclusion initiatives, student experience, and student advising for the entire College—opened Monday, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced in an email to College staff.
The Office is the product of a merger between the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life. Previously, the FDO had administered programming for freshmen, while the OSL provided support for student organizations, housing operations, College-wide diversity initiatives, and some aspects of House residential and social programming.
In her email, O’Dair wrote the DSO will allow administrators to better “support students.”
“By centralizing the services that are currently offered by the OSL and FDO, we will be able to provide greater linkage and continuity between a student’s first-year and sophomore year experiences and streamline student support throughout their entire four years at Harvard College,” she wrote.
O’Dair wrote that the new office will not merely centralize pre-existing programs, but also incorporate a number of new initiatives, including an Experiential Learning Center. The office will also aim to provide “more class-based programs” and serve as a point of contact for “Title IX information and support.”
As part of its oversight of student social programming, the DSO will be the primary liaison between the College and unrecognized groups seeking official Harvard recognition—and thereby avoiding the College’s social group sanctions.
The sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
In order to achieve recognition, social groups will have to demonstrate to some College administrators that they are either already co-ed or have a commitment to going gender-neutral down the road.
The creation of the DSO created some administrative turnover before its formal launch. The new administrative structure of the DSO means the College eliminated the position of dean of first-year students, occupied since 2004 by Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Dingman stepped down from his position at the end of the academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The reins to the nation’s oldest university changed hands Sunday over plates of salmon.
On his first day on the job, University President Lawrence S. Bacow prepared a home-cooked meal for his predecessor Drew G. Faust.
“While I can’t say for sure whether [Faust and her husband] enjoyed my grilled salmon, I know we all had lots of fun toasting Drew’s leadership,” Bacow wrote in a letter to Harvard faculty and staff Monday.
Bacow was named Faust’s successor in early February. After the announcement, Bacow said he would remain in “sponge mode” to soak up as much information as possible before taking over. In the final months of her tenure, Faust consulted Bacow on administrative matters like dean searches and introduced him to prominent alumni and donors.
Bacow will launch his tenure working from a temporary office in Loeb House while Massachusetts Hall, the traditional site of the offices of the University president, undergoes renovation. The building is slated to re-open at the end of the summer.
Bacow wrote in the letter that he feels “honored” to be Faust’s successor and that he is excited to begin his new job.
“I am one of countless people whose lives have been transformed by Harvard, and helping extend that experience to others is the opportunity of a lifetime,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow’s to-do list is already packed with a slew of challenges, including overseeing Harvard’s new Allston campus and battling growing hostility towards higher education around the country.
“We live in unusually challenging times — for Harvard and higher education, for the nation and the world,” Bacow wrote. “There is no place I would rather be, and no community I would rather be part of, to help address the challenges ahead and to consider how we can each do our part to meet them.”
In part to combat criticisms that Harvard and its peer Ivy League institutions are out of touch with the rest of the United States, Bacow plans to visit his hometown of Pontiac, Mich., he said in a recent interview with the Boston Globe. While there, he will announce new partnerships Harvard is undertaking with local institutions and schools, he told the Globe.
Bacow also faces a host of political challenges, including a fierce debate on immigration reform in Washington. During her tenure, Faust served as an outspoken opponent of the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies, especially President Donald Trump’s termination of Temporary Protected Status — a legal designation given to individuals from certain countries who have fled armed conflict or natural disasters — and his decision to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States.
These issues surfaced on Bacow’s doorstep his second day on the job.
A group of 30 Harvard staff, students, and faculty rallied in Harvard Yard Monday afternoon to deliver a letter to the new president asking Bacow to follow Faust’s precedent and advocate for permanent legal protections for undocumented individuals.
The rally was organized by the Harvard TPS Coalition, a group of workers, students, and faculty that advocates for permanent residency for individuals with TPS or DACA status.
The group’s letter asks Bacow to “encourage and lead the growing opposition to inhumane policies that are dividing families at the border and in our local communities” — a reference to the Trump administration's “zero-tolerance” policy, which in recent months has led to the separation of more than 2,000 immigrant children from their parents at the border.
Bacow previously praised Faust’s advocacy efforts for undocumented students and said he looked forward to serving as a “strong voice” on their behalf.
“Harvard remains deeply committed to supporting those in our community who have been impacted by recent changes in the federal government’s TPS, DACA and other immigration policies, and we will continue to make every effort to have our voice heard and to advocate for permanent legislative solutions to these challenging issues,” University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
In his letter to faculty and staff, Bacow thanked his new colleagues for welcoming him to campus and urged them to “come up and say hello” if they see him around Cambridge this summer.
“There’s nothing quite as invigorating as being a Harvard student again,” he wrote.
Bacow’s inauguration is scheduled to take place Oct. 5.
