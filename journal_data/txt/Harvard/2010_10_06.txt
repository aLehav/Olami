After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Apparently, our dear friends at Yale know how to throw a rowdy party. Over a dozen New Haven Police Department officers raided a party at a nightclub sponsored by two of Yale’s residential colleges early on Saturday morning, arresting five students and shocking another with a Taser, according to witnesses that spoke with the Yale Daily News. The officers, who students report were wielding assault rifles and wearing what seemed to be SWAT gear, had received a tip that there would be underage drinking at the nightclub Elevate on Crown   Street, according to New Haven Assistant Chief of Operations Ariel Melendez the morning of the raid, as reported in the YDN. The raid came after the NHPD had increased its efforts to reduce violence in downtown New Haven through what it termed “Operation Nightlife.” Based on available information, we believe the police’s response to the nightclub party was excessive. Both the hostile manner in which the officers arrived and the brutal actions they took inside the club—as described by Yale students and the club’s owners—greatly outweighed the necessary response to underage drinking.
The officers’ apparently aggressive arrival was disproportionate to the threat of the situation at the club. Although protective gear and large weaponry may be necessary for circumstances in which there is probable cause for or threat of violence, this party was not one of those occasions. Indeed, the NHPD had likely been responding to a tip they had received between 9:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. on Friday night, hours before the raid, which occurred just before 1:00 a.m. The threat of the event was therefore not urgent enough to call for the police’s garb and guns. In fact, this situation seems to have been a poor use of police resources. In a time of increased crime within New Haven, addressing violence ought to be a more important priority to the NHPD than responding to underage drinking.
While the police’s initial response to the party was inappropriate, we believe that their actions within the club were excessive, as well. For instance, students in the club have stated that four officers not only shocked one student with a Taser but also beat and jumped on him. Indeed, the officers were creating more of an unstable situation than they were responding to. Of the five students arrested on Saturday, only one was arrested for underage drinking, according to the YDN, two students were arrested for interference with police officers, and one each was arrested for assault on police officers and for disorderly conduct. Disobeying police officers is certainly reprehensible, but the fact that four of the five arrests seem to have resulted from the NHPD’s presence itself illuminates the disproportionate nature of the officers’ actions at the nightclub.
Yale administrators appear to be taking the situation very seriously, as Yale College Dean Mary E. Miller outlined in an email to students on Sunday night. She explained that Yale’s Dean of Student Affairs W. Marichal Gentry “was assigned to be the lead liaison with Denise Blanchard, Captain of Internal Affairs of the New Haven Police Department, who will be overseeing the process which may lead to a formal investigation.” As the university continues to collect facts about the incident, we hope the Yale administration will continue to stand up for their students’ rights. Indeed, Yalies deserve a detailed account of the police raid, and we call upon the NHPD to provide one.
We must recognize that, as Harvard students, this situation has entered our awareness largely because it affected students at our peer institution. However, police should never treat members of a community in the manner they allegedly did; arriving with the degree of weaponry and body armor students report is inappropriate when there is neither probable cause nor threat of violence. In any case, it appears that the police response to the party at Elevate escalated out of control. It’s time that the NHPD brings justice back to New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tyler Clementi, an 18-year old student at Rutgers  University, apparently committed suicide two weeks ago after his roommate allegedly videotaped and streamed Clementi being romantically involved with another man. Less than a week later, Raymond Chase, aged 19, an openly gay sophomore at Johnson & Wales in Providence, Rhode   Island reportedly hanged himself in his residence hall room. Campus Pride marked Chase as the fifth LGBT-related teenage suicide in the past three weeks. Indeed, these deaths are part of a tragic string of LGBT-related “bullycides” that have claimed the lives of several college, high school, and even elementary school students, over the past year. News reporters, lawmakers, school administrators, and politicians are rightfully alarmed over these recent tragedies. However, their emphasis on “bullying” is mistaking the proximal cause for the true root of the problem. What our nation needs is not stricter bullying laws and enforcement but a cultural climate more tolerant of LGBT youth.
The emphasis that has been placed upon cyberbullying and bullying in the classroom oversimplifies the issues at hand. It is certainly true that harassment is an important issue for our society to grapple with, publically and legally. Whether online, in the workforce, or in the classroom, bullying is an incredibly damaging and harmful phenomenon. However, the response to the recent suicides myopically ignores the true cause of these incidents: intolerance of abnormality.
The truth is, bullies are not born, but created. It is our culture, our politics, and our laws that teach bullies that alternative sexualities and lifestyles are unnatural, immoral, and worthy of stigmatization. A survey in 2009 found that 85 percent of LGBT students report experiencing harassment at school. Another study estimated that almost a quarter of queer teenagers drop out of school because of harassment. Finally, queer teen suicide rates are four times those of their straight classmates. There is a reason why individuals with or perceived as having LGBT lifestyles are more at risk for being bullied—because bullies are taught that these people are inferior.
At this time, America needs to do more than merely tighten bullying laws and move on. Instead, it is time for politicians, reporters, teachers, school administrators, and religious leaders to realize that widespread cultural intolerance of LGBT identities has tangible effects on school climates and students. These teenagers are not merely victims of a few bullies from their school but victims of a political environment polluted by hazardous, hateful, and homophobic rhetoric.
There are some concrete steps toward remedying this problem. As of this June, only 17 states (and Washington D.C) have laws that address LGBT-related bullying and discrimination in elementary, middle, or high school. As of June 2009, at least 14 states still lack any hate-crime laws that protect LGBT identities. Elected officials still refuse to legalize same-sex marriage, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” has yet to be repealed, and the Defense of Marriage Act continues to exist. Together, these homophobic laws and lack of proper legal protections send a message to the bullies and bullied of America that being gay is still not ok.
Indeed, what is really needed in response to the tragedies of the past week is climate change. We, as Harvard students and as Americans, need to create a more tolerant and welcoming climate for all students.

We should have known something was in the air when Ken B. Mehlman, former chairman of the Republican National Committee and outspoken opponent of gay rights, announced that he is himself gay.  By itself, the coming out of a single Republican big shot is hardly news, as GOP congressmen and televangelists seem to be the fastest growing segments of the homosexual population.  In fact, this story would have lasted as long as the new show “Are You Smarter than a Fifth Term Congressman?” had a federal judge not followed it by striking down “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”  For those of you who’ve been living under a rock without internet connectivity, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is the Clinton-era policy that permits gays to serve in the U.S. military so long as they pretend to be a deaf mute (or chairman of the Republican National Committee).
At last.  Our courts have bravely stopped harassing wise Latina women and started opposing unjust policies.  And this comes only 17 years after “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” was adopted, and mere months after the Pentagon had already begun taking steps to scrap it because the policy is about as sensible as Arizona Senator John S. McCain’s new take on immigration (“Don’t Ask, Don’t Dwell”).
The real news here is that the same U.S. military that we alfalfa-eating, latte-sipping, quinoa-marrying liberals love to hate has proven to be one of the voices of reason in this country (the other is the guy who gives the time and temperature on the evening news). It’s not just that they were among the first to realize that Tivo-ing Project Runway is no more a threat to our national security than is an invasion of the plastic soldiers from Toy Story (although I really don’t trust those green aliens).  It was our soldiers who pointed out that we can’t really convince folks in the Middle East that we mean them no harm, even though we keep shooting at them, if we declare war on their religion.  General David H. Petraeus was the first to say that Terry Jones, a two-bit preacher in Gainesville, Florida with a flock of 30 souls who apparently couldn’t find an open liquor store or a park bench to pass out on, was on the wrong track in proposing to burn Korans on September 11th.  Then Robert M. Gates, Secretary of Defense and founder of Microsoft (“Don’t Ask, We’re Swell”), personally called Jones to offer to use Jones’s bingo parlor as a testing ground for the next generation of Air Force missiles.  Problem solved.
Terry Jones won’t be the last moron to distort beyond recognition our religious and political traditions.  Ever since George Washington got other people to pay him for whitewashing his cherry tree, morons have played a vital role in the civic life of America.  They attempted to achieve independence with an underwater tea party and walked around wearing wigs for no apparent reason.  They appointed a Supreme Court justice named Salmon (“Don’t Ask. Just Don’t Ask”).  They bought Alaska.  In more recent times, they spent billions to put a huge “Mission Accomplished” banner on an aircraft carrier and rammed it into New Orleans.  To this day, morons constitute a majority in both houses of Congress.
Even worse, technology now makes it possible even for stupid people who aren’t the leader of the free world to do extraordinary damage.  The Central Intelligence Agency is uncertain about Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but it’s beyond a reasonable doubt that the real weapons of mass destruction are Fox News, Al Jazeera and the Drudge Report.   Without their incessant, mindless coverage, Terry Jones would be anonymously pumping gas in Gainesville and Fox News host Glenn Beck would be teaching the third grade, hysterically bemoaning the modern day use of dry erase boards.  But we’re no more likely to see television go back to what it does best —covering LeBron James’s favorite bowel movements—than we are to see Congress holding its sessions on Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann’s family farm (“Don’t Ask, Don’t Smell”).
The demise of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” won’t usher in a new era of common sense and tolerance across the board.  Gays still won’t be able to marry in most states.  Automatic rifles will still be handed out like candy at gun shows, banks, and middle school graduations.  And we’ll always have Levi Johnston.  So while we owe a great debt to General Petraeus and Secretary Gates for stopping these particular bouts of stupidity, they alone can’t stop the media’s never-ending efforts to blow out of proportion every nutcase and nincompoop who comes along.  With “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” headed to the legislative trash heap, what we really need is “Don’t Ask, Don’t Televise.” But that’s about as likely as a repeat of Congressman Dennis Kucinich’s Macarena incident of ’02.
Don’t Ask. He Fell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College is home to some of the most brilliant students in the world, who should, and usually do, devote themselves to righting the world’s greatest wrongs. But living in the privileged environment of Harvard Square can make trivial problems appear more important than they are. One such problem is the exclusion of women from final clubs, a so-called atrocity that has taken precedence over genuine injustices on this campus and in the broader community.
As every undergraduate knows, the eight all-male final clubs, Harvard’s elite, private-propertied social organizations, gladly allow women to attend their parties but do not accept them as members. This is undoubtedly unfair: It puts female students at the mercy of their male counterparts when it comes to their social lives, and denies them access to the prestige and alumni relationships the clubs offer. Harvard disowned the clubs in 1984, and their alleged sexism is a topic of perennial finger wagging among students and faculty.
But the exclusivity of these glorified frat houses is minor league compared to the serious crimes committed against women at this university. Administrators at the Harvard Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response noted in an interview that about eighty students sought help at their facilities during the 2009-2010 academic year after experiencing rape, sexual assault, or relationship violence, though such incidents are known to be severely underreported. With this sort of thing going on, it’s puzzling why one would notice the admissions practices of final clubs at all.
Some have charged that the clubs are the principal venues of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus, and that this is directly related to the fact that men control them; any such behavior would obviously be grounds for intervention. Final clubs strongly dispute this accusation, but to the extent that it may be true, it seems to ignore the reality that sexual abuse occurs on a massive scale at colleges across the country: U.S. Department of Justice statistics indicate that 20 to 25 percent of female students nationwide are victims of an attempted or completed rape during college. Although no one would deny that whatever sexual assault occurs in final clubs warrants some type of reform, the prevalence of rape elsewhere demands a more fundamental solution than accepting women as members. And it should be primarily sexual misconduct—not the inability of women to enjoy the rights of membership—that motivates calls for reform.
In that sense, it’s troubling to hear Harvard women say that their exclusion from final clubs makes them “second-class citizens,” as one student put it in an interview for a Crimson piece last spring. The same article referred to female final clubs as a “separate but equal” remedy, and argued that the all-male clubs should integrate right away since “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”
Travel less than two miles east of Harvard Square and you’ll find Transition House, which provides a critical service for people with far greater worries than whether to party at the Fox or the Spee. Since 1975 Transition House has provided emergency shelter for women and children escaping domestic violence. It’s a service in high demand: The 2000 National Violence Against Women Survey reports that about a quarter of American women experience domestic violence during their lives, which may include anything from physical abuse to sexual assault to homicide. Massachusetts is no exception. The National Network to End Domestic Violence reports that during a 24-hour survey last year, battered women’s shelters in the commonwealth served 2,018 victims, including 683 who received housing.
Fortunately, there is government and charitable aid to fund care for many of the victims, but Craig Norberg-Bohm of Jane Doe, Inc., an umbrella organization for battered women’s shelters throughout the state, explained in an interview that “there’s a waiting list everywhere.” During the same 24-hour survey, shelters in Massachusetts denied 301 requests for services due to lack of funds and staff. Resources have been particularly strained in the past two years as a result of the recession. Cambridge’s Transition House reports a thirty percent surge in demand since 2008, which far exceeds its capacity.
The criticism of final clubs isn’t unjustified per se, but it is small minded in light of the genuine abuse women routinely suffer in this very city. A serious discussion of women’s rights in this community—and in this country—would focus on ways to prevent atrocities like domestic violence and sexual assault, not to mention more serious crimes like commercial sex trafficking, rather than how privileged college students spend their Saturday evenings. Unlike the patrons of Transition House, Harvard women have the benefit of the finest education in the world and the potential to succeed beyond most people’s wildest dreams. For them, the all-male clubs are nothing more than a four-year inconvenience.
It would be nice if the final clubs were integrated; it would make the lives of female students a little easier and serve as a prominent symbol of gender equality. But our energies would be better spent finding concrete ways to prevent sexual abuse on college campuses like ours and to improve the living standard of women in abusive relationships who fear for their lives—the real second-class citizens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former Harvard Medical School physician and his business partner who said they had $80 million worth of artwork stolen last year from their California home filed a lawsuit last week against the Sheriff’s Department of Monterey County for defamation.
Last September, Ralph Kennaugh and Angelo B. Amadio reported that works by Pollock, Van Gogh, Miro, and Rembrandt had been stolen from their home in Pebble Beach, Calif.
The artwork has not been recovered, and no arrests have been made in the case at this point.
The Sheriff’s Department shifted the focus of the investigation within a month to the victims themselves after investigators said the pair failed to cooperate, Commander Mike Richards told The Crimson last October.
“They are not answering questions, cooperating with detectives, or providing us with identifying information on the stolen property,” Richards said. “We just don’t know [what happened], but something is not right.”
Now Kennaugh and Amadio allege that the police portrayed them in false light, framing them as “criminals, liars and scam artists in the eye of the public.”
“Despite the detailed and extensive information provided by the Plaintiffs, the Sheriff’s Department chose to egregiously lie and report to the public that the Plaintiffs were not cooperating with them,” according to the complaint.
The Sheriff’s Department said Kennaugh and Amadio could not produce sufficient documentation to prove they had owned the art they reported stolen.
On Oct. 9, Kennaugh and Amadio provided officials with a document listing the artwork that had been stolen, but Richards said the Sheriff’s Department could not verify its authenticity.
According to the police, Kennaugh and Amadio at the time only had a general casualty insurance policy that provided coverage for personal belongings worth up to $500,000—considerably less than the value of the artwork they reported stolen.
Kennaugh and Amadio are suing the Sheriff’s Department for a total of 26 defamatory statements, including one made in a press conference immediately following the reported theft in which Richards said, “the heist appears to be something else: a scam by one or both of the alleged victims.”
The plaintiffs also accuse a detective of slander for allegedly using a homophobic slur.
In response to this charge, Commander Mike Richards told a Monterey County newspaper last week that “No one in their right mind would believe a professional investigator working on a crime scene would say something like that. I think it’s absurd.”
The plaintiffs are seeking general and special damages, punitive damages against Richards, and reimbursement for the costs of the suit.
Both Richards and the plaintiffs did not respond to requests for comment.

Two of Harvard’s biomedical engineering professors have been awarded a $3.3 million federally funded grant to develop a “Heart-Lung Micromachine” that can test the effectiveness and safety of cardiopulmonary drugs.
The grant—awarded by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health—is part of a recent effort by federal agencies to promote the development of new scientific approaches to testing medical technologies.
The team at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will be led by Donald E. Ingber, director of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and by Kevin “Kit” K. Parker.
Ingber and Parker will build tiny three-dimensional models of internal organs that mimic biological processes.
The grant will allow the researchers to model the heart and the lungs within a single device that Parker described as a “cardio-pulmonary system on a chip.”
Using this device, they will be able to measure the real-time impact of a new drug or therapy on the heart and lungs—potentially a more efficient alternative to using more traditional animal testing methods.
“With this kind of tool, we can do all sorts of toxicity studies on new drugs and move to a... [new] model about how the lung and the heart work together,” Parker said.
Parker had already begun the initial stages of the project last spring, which he admitted to be a complicated machine.
“This is going to be hard as heck to pull off,” Parker said.
In addition to the Harvard team, the FDA and NIH also awarded grants totalling $9.4 million to three other teams at the University of Michigan, Washington University in St. Louis, and Pennsylvania-based MB Research Laboratories, Inc.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Paul Glootz ’13, a pleasant weekend trip home to the city of Magdeburg, Germany, culminated in an appearance on a live German national television show on Monday night.
Falling on the 20th anniversary of Germany’s reunification, the weekly political talk show called “Fakt Ist…!”—which translates to “The Fact Is...!” in English—gathered a panel of speakers to discuss how the reunification of Germany in 1990 has affected its citizens.
The Pforzheimer House resident and native of Magdeburg, a city located in the former East Germany, was invited to speak on show after the German news channel MDR interviewed him following his admission to Harvard College.
“People from the show saw the story and thought I was a good representative of my generation,” he said. “So they asked me if I wanted to be on the show representing the generation born around or right after the reunion” of East and West Germany.
Before leaving for Europe, Glootz said that he intended to speak “about how many new opportunities we’ve gotten now that there are no restrictions [on] travel or education.”
Though reunification took place two decades ago, differences between the two regions are still evident, and certain stereotypes still prevail in people’s minds, according to Glootz. For example, West Germany is still visibly more affluent than its Eastern counterpart, and many West Germans question the appropriateness of subsidizing infrastructure development in East Germany, he said.
“The point of equality hasn’t been reached yet, and even though there’s been a lot of progress, living standards and education are still different, and they’re still the basis for conflict,” Glootz said.
Prior to his appearance on TV, Glootz said he put a considerable amount of thought into what he would contribute to the show—particularly since as a Harvard student representing his generation from East Germany, many eyes would be on him.
“I’ve not been that nervous about appearing on national TV, but I feel like I’m going to be. It’s a lot of responsibility to be chosen to represent such a large group of people,” Glootz said. “The show really forced me to think about these issues more—whether we’ve truly unified in our minds, or if it’s just on paper.”
Alongside Glootz appeared speakers who lived through different eras of recent German history: Wolfgang Böhmer, minister-president of the German state of Saxony-Anhalt; Clemens Meyer, an award-winning German author; and Joachim Gauck, a human rights activist and former German presidential candidate.
Before leaving, Glootz said he was really looking forward to spending a few days at home with his family on a farm near the TV station.
Iris Glootz, his mother, said she was very proud that her son was invited to speak alongside such famous personalities.
“[Glootz] can show to all the young people over here that everyone can take matters into his or her own hands and that the realization of dreams is worth all the hard work. Everyone can go for his or her own dreams independent of the social circumstances,” she wrote in an e-mail from Germany.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences administration has committed itself to determining its core priorities in preparation for the University’s upcoming capital campaign, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said at yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
Setting its sights on the future after spending nearly two years focusing on budgetary reform, the Faculty turned its attention to long-term academic goals and to areas that may most benefit from the capital campaign.
University President Drew G. Faust revealed in March that Harvard had begun planning for its next capital campaign after over five years of delays. Harvard’s last campaign, which ended in 2001, raised $2.6 billion ($3.2 billion in today’s dollars).
Smith said that he has begun discussions with the academic deans and will continue to meet with faculty leaders across the school as he prepares a list of FAS priorities that he will present to University President Drew G. Faust at the start of the spring semester.
As central administrators work to determine the priorities for the upcoming capital campaign, FAS will contribute to the process by shaping the University’s fundraising goals, according to Smith. He highlighted priorities for the school over the coming years, including undergraduate financial aid, teaching reform, and House renewal.
Now that FAS has a more positive financial outlook, Smith said that the school can return to its core academic priorities and consider projects such as House renewal, a two-year-old proposal that has since been postponed in the face of financial pressures.
“Our residential house system is the cornerstone of the undergraduate experience here,” Smith said.
Construction remains several years away and will depend upon the funds available, according to Smith. He said that the school will no longer use borrowed money for large-scale projects, as it had in flush years earlier in the decade.
“We have entered a new era in capital planning,” Smith said.
Not only did FAS reduce its budget deficit from $110 to $35 million over the past year, but it finished the previous fiscal year with a $3.6 million surplus in its annual budget.
Smith hailed the sum as a welcome figure: when initially budgeting for the last academic year, he had predicted a $21 million deficit.
Although the surplus is small, “this represents significant effort on the part of Faculty and staff,” Smith said.
Smith—who will publish later this month the annual Dean’s Report that details the school’s savings—credited the improving financial situation to the work of FAS units and donators whose gifts surpassed the school’s fundraising goals.
HARVARD RETIREMENT PLANS
Economics Professor David I. Laibson ’88 concluded yesterday’s meeting with a lecture on reforms concerning the retirement investment options for some 30,000 Harvard employees, including faculty members in FAS.
Laibson spoke on behalf of the Harvard University Retirement Plans Investment Committee, which formulated the plan to provide Harvard employees greater direction in their investment decisions.
Despite fewer options, Harvard employees will have access to “life-cycle” funds that reduces risk for individuals as they approach retirement.
Laibson said that the changes could help save $60 million in fees over the next decade for employees who choose to follow the University plan.
Laibson said he will take part in the University’s program.
“I’ll be there, and I hope you will be there too,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 40 students walked out of the Social Studies 10 lecture yesterday in protest of the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies’s decision to accept a $650,000 undergraduate research fund named in honor of former Harvard Professor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz, who has come under fire for what protestors describe as a 25-year history of making bigoted remarks.
Before class began, several students involved in the protest greeted their peers outside the Social Studies 10 Sever Hall classroom, distributing white slips of paper which declared, “We, the Social Studies concentrators of 2013, demand that the name of the Martin Peretz fund be changed: A 25-Year Record of Racism Cannot Be Erased With $650,000.”
According to students involved in the walkout, 39 students of about 150 students stood up and left lecture minutes after class began. Walkout demonstrators were supposed to recite the message on the sheets, but they left before doing so.
“This particular demonstration may have been small, but we are hoping that this can turn into a long-term movement for racism and sexism,” said Nancy Y. Xie ’13, who participated in the walkout. “People respect Harvard—if we can take the lead, people will follow.”
Other students highlighted their concern about what they perceived as Peretz’s history of racist comments.
“This is about appreciating diversity and promoting it,” Adan Acevedo ’13 said.
Martin A. Evelyn ’13 said because “being at Harvard means being a voice,” the community is responsible to “set a precedent” against enduring racism.
“This is our small step towards a new Harvard that lives up to the ideals,” Evelyn said.
But the protest was met with little reaction from Andrew Jewett, one of the two course instructors.
After the last protestor walked out of class, Jewett turned to the class, asking “Okay, where were we?” before resuming the lecture.
Jewett had been informed of the scheduled protest beforehand, telling the class “Lets go ahead and get started today—I understand we have a walkout scheduled.”
The walkout follows a week of petitions and other protests, including a demonstration attended by Social Studies staff, students, and alumni last Saturday at the Social Studies 50th anniversary celebration during which Peretz was honored.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust delivered a rousing defense of the humanities and institutions of higher education, drawing extended applause from the professors gathered at yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
Faust was responding to concerns from Virginie Greene, chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. Greene said she was upset by last week’s announcement that the State University of New York at Albany—facing more than $32 million in cuts to state funding—will dissolve many of its humanities departments, including classics, theater, and some languages.
“I feel understandably dismayed by this news, but I believe we should all feel dismayed,” Greene said before asking for a statement from Faust.
The President, appearing calm and confident, was ready with a response.
Faust said that in the wake of the financial crisis of recent years, she has continually emphasized the importance of the humanities. She added that support is widespread, pointing to the recent donation of $10 million by Anand G. Mahindra ’77 to the Harvard Humanities Center.
ZERO-WASTE
Green may have been the new Crimson two years ago, but the color is still in vogue: FAS is continuing its quest to be more environmentally friendly.
The coffee cups beside the Starbucks dispensers are now the pale-green and white eco-cups commonly used across campus. The Dean’s Annual Report, formerly printed, will now be available only online. And many events, including Faculty meetings themselves, have become “zero-waste” events.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith spoke of the new “zero-waste” approach at Faculty meetings as soon as he stepped up to the microphone.
He also listed several waste-free events that have already taken place this academic year: the Chemistry Department’s Aug. 26 barbecue, CGIS’ Aug. 11 ice cream social, and the Department of Comparative Literature’s welcome back party.
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
Yesterday’s meeting took a turn when it morphed into a personal finance seminar.
Professor of Economics David I. Laibson ’88 gave the Faculty updates to the University’s retirement investment options.
Before a full room of senior Harvard faculty members, Laibson delivered a clear and thorough lecture on the benefits of Harvard’s recent reforms, which schools and organizations across the nation have been making over the course of the last decade.
“We employees will save $3 million in year one,” Laibson said of the altered options.
But facing an inquisitive audience, Laibson found himself facing a barrage of questions from Faculty members, some of which devolved into questions about where individual professors should invest their money.
Laibson humored the professors’ queries.
“I’ll be offering personal financial advice in my office later,” Laibson joked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of people traded umbrellas for candles last night as they stood in the rain to commemorate the lives lost to suicide due to anti-LGBT bullying and discrimination.
The LGBT activist group Join the Impact Massachusetts teamed up with other organizations to hold the candlelight vigil at the Massachusetts State House and issue a call to action to stop the trend of bullying in schools.
Between Sept. 9 and Sept. 30, nine men­—spanning the ages of 13 to 19 and representing a range of backgrounds—chose to end their lives rather than face continued harassment based on their sexuality. Two lesbian women, aged 17 and 21, were added to the death toll yesterday morning.
“This problem has been going on for so long, but it’s only in the last few weeks that we have realized its severity,” said David Mailloux, a co-chair of Join the Impact Massachusetts and lead vigil organizer. “We’re here to make people stop and think about how we can start making change in perceptions of LGBT people so that events like this do not continue.”
The vigil was organized to coincide with National Safe Schools Day, which recognizes the dual needs of building community and creating awareness about bullying in schools.
“This day of action brings to light that LGBT or perceived LGBT youth have allies in the community,” said Shannon Cuttle of the Safe Schools Action Network. “This signals the start of a campaign and movement building this school year to empower students, teachers and communities to create inclusive safe schools.”
As the vigil began, a sign stating “Equality For All—Join the Impact” was unfurled as the song “Lean on Me” played over the loudspeakers.
After Mailloux welcomed the vigil’s attendees with a plea for solidarity and a call to action, an array of speakers—including Gunner Scott of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition and two transgender youths who discussed their own experiences with harassment­—stood on the concrete ledge in front of the State House to speak out against violence and demand action to prevent it in the future.
Susan J. Hyde of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said that although Massachusetts is the first state to have legalized same-sex marriage and to have an anti-bullying law on the books, implementation of the law is neither funded nor staffed. She called on attendees to demand the enforcement of anti-bullying laws and to speak out against homophobia, from the words of some politicians and religious leaders condemning LGBT people as “morally bankrupt” to the frequent schoolyard insult, “that’s so gay.”
“With this kind of inflammatory rhetoric,” she said, “It should be no surprise that kids are still bullied and sometimes buried. We should be outraged.”
While outrage was a rallying sentiment of attendees and speakers, others emphasized hope for change.
“We will be silent no longer,” said Reverend Jack P. Lewis of the Unitarian Universalist Society of Wellesley, Mass., at the end of the moment of silence that began the vigil. “We will stand united as a community and say to these youth, you are not alone. You don’t need to live in your closet, and you certainly don’t need your closet to become your coffin.”
Ryan A. Hanley ’12, a co-founder of Join the Impact Massachusetts, said that the number of people who showed up to the vigil highlighted not only the tragedy of the recent weeks’ suicides, but the drive to change the status quo.
“Not only are we paying tribute to the people who have died,” he said. “We’re also standing in solidarity with the people who are still alive and face this culture of homophobia every day.” —Staff writer Alice E.M. Underwood can be reached at aeunderw@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some football players know their future early on. It’s the game they grow up with, a path they must follow as soon as they can fit into shoulder pads.
But for sophomore running back Rich Zajeski, there was no pressure while starting young—in the beginning, football was just about fun.
“I actually played soccer growing up, [but] a bunch of my friends…all played football, so naturally I just wanted to play with my friends,” Zajeski said. “I think I was like 10...and I’ve been with it since.”
But after a seemingly carefree start to the game, the 5’11” tailback gradually developed his skills, and it soon became clear that football ought to be his focus.
The multi-sport athlete dropped baseball as well, making room to devote himself year-round to a game that would largely dictate his future.
“It was just a big commitment to try to do both [sports] at the same time,” Zajeski said. “And to really achieve the things I wanted to achieve in football, I decided that’s what I had to do. It was a hard decision, but I’m glad that I made it.”
The accomplishments rolled in for the standout runner, who quickly ascended to become team captain and lead his Hinsdale Central High School team to the Illinois state championship.
“[Zajeski] was one of the finest players we’ve had in pretty much every measurable way,” said Hinsdale head coach Mike Dimatteo. “He had a ridiculously dedicated work ethic to his studies and football.”
Soon enough, the college offers started rolling in, and when the Ivies came calling, Zajeski was ecstatic.
“Harvard, when I looked at it—they’re perennially a powerhouse in football, and academically obviously there are very few schools in the world, if any, that could say that they are on par with Harvard,” he said. “I knew that I wanted to play football, but I also knew that I wanted to get a good education, and also I had realistic expectations for myself. I knew that I wasn’t a big-time D-I athlete that was going to go play at Florida or something like that.”
At first his coach disagreed, but after the decision was final, Dimatteo knew his star player was right at home.
“This is not a knock on Harvard, but I thought [Zajeski] could have played somewhere in MAC, played a bigger level of football,” the coach said, “but Rich is also a student, and he understands the value of that. That’s why it was the perfect choice.”
Indeed, the running back jumped at the chance to join one of the winningest FCS programs of the decade.
But the former captain soon realized that he would have to spend time following before he could lead. Zajeski arrived last season to find a talented pair of running backs ahead of him—classmate Treavor Scales and then-junior feature back Gino Gordon.
Rather than feel discouraged in a crowded backfield, though, Zajeski took the opportunity to learn.
“Gino is just unbelievable,” Zajeski said. “He just knows so much about the game, not only about what our schemes are and what the plays are, but also just general wisdom about how to play running back. And then Treavor, he’s such an amazing athlete. He does things that I’ve never seen someone do before on a football field.”
Not surprisingly, Scales and Gordon continue to earn the bulk of the carries after teaming up to lead the Ivy League in rushing last season. But suddenly they can both hear Zajeski’s footsteps.
“When you have these young guys kind of clipping at your heels every time, it really pushes you to keep trying,” Gordon said in the preseason.
“Z is a baller. He’s a great back, and I’m glad that he’s finally gotten the chance to showcase what he’s got,” Scales added. “It’s not a dropoff going from Gino or me to him. We’ve got good competition going on…He’s constantly rising to meet every single challenge.”
Indeed, it’s this playful competition that keeps the entire team on its toes. While Zajeski emphasized that the running back group supports each other, like any true gamer, once he steps on the field, he expects to be part of the action.
“Everyone that’s playing college football is an extremely competitive person, so I’d be lying to say that there’s no competition between us,” Zajeski said. “There’s always this desire between us to outdo the other one. You know, Gino breaks a 70-yard run, and then Treavor and I want to break a 75-yard run.”
Of course, in the end there’s just one ball, and the running game remains far from an equitable platoon.
Gordon has led the way with a gaudy 8.2 yards per rush average, rolling for 231 total yards and three touchdowns, but Zajeski has the second-most touches on the team this season, taking 21 handoffs for 91 yards, including his first-career touchdown last weekend against Lafayette.
And while the sophomore’s touches may not continue during the Ivy slate—he tellingly handled the ball just once in a loss to Brown—missing out on handoffs won’t keep Zajeski off the field. The tailback has embraced an additional special teams role, determined to bolster the Crimson in any way possible.
This team-first attitude is just one of the factors that has propelled Zajeski this far. Whether he’s leading as a captain or following in others' footsteps, the running back has never failed to earn his teammates’ respect, nor has he lost his sense of fun along the way.
“One element [Zajeski] brings is definitely his energy,” Scales said. “He’s a great guy to be around. He might seem quiet, but he’s the jokester on the team, humble but funny, especially with all his one-liners.”
But for the coach who got him this far, Zajeski’s potential on the football field is only the beginning.
“Will [our players] be good family members, good, contributing members to their community? Those are things we measure as a program, and we’ve seen that with Rich,” Dimatteo said. “He comes by and lifts with our guys, works with them, and I couldn’t be more proud as a head coach. We couldn’t be more proud of what he’s done.”

Reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year Kyle Casey suffered a broken metatarsal while playing pickup basketball with his teammates Saturday afternoon, Casey told The Crimson Sunday night.
“I got the ball and made a hard cut going to the rim,” Casey said. “I felt a pop, and I fell.”
Casey had X-rays taken Sunday afternoon that revealed the break in his foot and underwent surgery at Boston’s Baptist Hospital yesterday.
He is expected to miss between six and eight weeks before returning to the court and will likely be out for the opening portion of Harvard’s nonconference schedule.
“It could have been worse, so I’m just trying to stay optimistic, but it’s pretty bad news for myself and my team,” Casey said.
Heading into his sophomore season, Casey was predicted by several media outlets to contend for the Ivy League Player of the Year Award while helping the Crimson compete for its first conference title.
As a freshman, Casey led the Crimson in rebounding and finished second in scoring, averaging 10.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.

When I was in fifth grade, I learned about Hammurabi’s Code. I won’t say that I remember every last detail about Mesopotamia from Social Studies that year, but the concept of “an eye for an eye” certainly caught my attention.
I realize now that the sporting world could learn a great deal from the Babylonian king.
Shortly after 6 pm on Saturday, Sept. 25, the Ivy football landscape was altered when Harvard quarterback Andrew Hatch suffered a concussion on his first play of the game against Brown. Hatch missed this past weekend’s game against Lafayette, and the verdict is still out on when he will return.
There was no penalty on the play, but even if there was, it’s hard to argue that lost yards on one possession would hurt the Bears nearly as much as the loss of its starting quarterback hurt the Crimson.
But more importantly, nothing can undo the damage of the concussion Hatch suffered.
Injuries are often considered to be another part of athletics. Football players in particular seem to be judged, unfairly or not, by their ability to take a hit. But concussions cannot be seen as simple bad luck.
The potential effects of head trauma sustained during a concussion—which include an increased risk of Alzheimer’s and psychiatric disorders—have recently come into the spotlight.
Head trauma from football appears to have played a role in the suicide of Penn football captain Owen Thomas and may have factored into the suicide of high school football player Austin Trenum.
This is where Hammurabi comes in. To be clear, the “eye for an eye” system I suggest does not involve inflicting concussions on players who give them to others. And it certainly wouldn’t solve the original problem of limiting concussions. sustained.
What I propose is that a player who gives someone else a concussion should sit out as many games as the player who sustains the concussion.
In both college athletics and the professional ranks, suspensions are most commonly given for off-field actions, but why should accountability be limited to off-field actions?
Suspending those who give other players concussions sends the message that the league—be it the NFL or the NCAA­—will not tolerate the abuse of its players.
I recognize that I may sound somewhat biased, given my citation of the concussion suffered by my school’s quarterback. I would like to note that I am not accusing anyone of the Brown football team of intentionally hurting anyone on the Harvard team, including Hatch. The Bears played an excellent game of football and were the deserving victors.
My intention is not to punish but to suggest a framework that discourages concussion-inducing play.
Concussion research and legislation have moved towards understanding how to rest and care for players who have concussions.
But given that there is no definite treatment for head trauma, finding ways to avoid it seems just as important.
And perhaps the added punishment to those who induce concussions will convince athletes that they aren’t being disloyal or weak when admitting that they have head trauma.
For the most part, I don’t believe athletes’ silence is forced upon them by coaches or trainers, Mike Leach controversy notwithstanding.
Though perhaps the possibility of an opponent being suspended might encourage coaches to admit their player’s injury and get him the help he needs.
But in general I think the reluctance to admit a concussion is just an unfortunate downside of one of athletes’ most heralded qualities—their toughness and loyalty to their team.
Athletes are taught from an early age to tough it out through pain and injuries, and unfortunately, many follow this mantra when it is potentially devastating to personal well-being.
“Taking one for the team” should be thrown out when one’s long-term health hangs in the balance.

Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has added a third player to his latest recruiting class.
Corbin Miller, a senior at Brighton High School (Salt Lake City, Utah) made a verbal commitment to the Crimson while on a visit to campus Saturday evening.
“Obviously, the academics were part of it. Also, I felt really good with the basketball program. It just fit me,” Miller said of the reasons for his decision.
“The bottom line is, he loves the way that Tommy Amaker plays out there,” added his father, Bret Miller, who is also an AAU coach. “From a basketball standpoint, coach Amaker was kind of the turning point, and then Harvard speaks for itself.”
The 6’2”, 175-lb. guard had been considering offers from Stanford, Boston College, Arizona State, Gonzaga, Utah, Utah State, BYU, and UNLV, among others. Vanderbilt had been recruiting him heavily but had not yet given him an offer.
Miller carries a rating of 90 by ESPN, which ranks him the No. 56 shooting guard nationally, and the Intermountain Hoops Scouting Service places him among the top five members of Utah’s class of 2011.
Though not the quickest player, Miller is a prolific shooter who averaged 16.1 points and 2.7 three-pointers per game as a junior last season.
“He’s a big-time shooter—he can shoot off the dribble; he can catch and shoot,” the elder Miller said. “He’s got NBA range...he has a high basketball IQ.”
It currently appears that Harvard will have the marksman’s services on the court for only a year before he takes time off from school.
“I’m thinking I’ll play a year, and then go on a [Church of Latter-day Saints] mission, so I”ll be gone for two years,” Miller said. “And then I”ll come back to Harvard.”
A 4.0 GPA-student, Miller will play both point guard and off the ball for an up-tempo Crimson team.
“I”m more than just a shooter,” said Miller, who joins Jonah Travis (Minneapolis, Minn.) and Kenyatta Smith (Brea, Calif.) in Harvard’s future class of 2015.
Miller was accompanied by two other high school seniors during his weekend trip to Cambridge.
One such visitor was Wesley Saunders, a 6’6”, 205-lb. small forward at Windward High School (Los Angeles, Calif.) ranked No. 20 at his position and No. 80 overall in the nation by Rivals. Saunders confirmed yesterday that he is down to five schools: Colorado, Harvard, Penn, Loyola Marymount, and USC.
“I’ve taken all my officials—I visited Penn, Colorado, Harvard and went on unofficials to USC and LMU,” Saunders said. “I’m just going to sit down with my parents and try to figure out which school I’ll be spending the next four years at.”
Saunders said all his options are pretty much even at this point and that his decision will be coming some time soon after this week.
“I really liked it,” the talented wing said of his most recent visit. “I got to see all Harvard had to offer, and I was really impressed by it.”
Saunders brought up a number of similarities and differences when asked to compare the two Ivies on his list.
“I felt like there was a better connection with the players; I thought the talent level was a little higher at Harvard,” Saunders said. “I thought that Penn had more of a social environment than Harvard did, just a more social school. Obviously the academics are really good at both schools.”
The final player welcomed by Amaker and his staff was Mike Turner. A 6’8”, 205-lb. combo forward at Chicago University High, Turner is currently evaluating his options, according to Troy Caldwell, his high school coach.
“Our goal and plan is to have him sign in the early signing period in November,” Caldwell said.
Turner’s top six is currently Penn, Harvard, Princeton, Northwestern, Valparaiso, and UIC. The major players are currently Penn and Harvard, Caldwell confirmed.
“He had a great visit down at Harvard,” Caldwell said.
Ranked in the top 30 in the state by several writers, Turner is “a highly mobile and active post who has the ability to take command on the floor, both with his scoring inside and his ability to rebound,” according to ChicagoHoops.com.

A year ago, the Harvard women’s soccer team stomped on Fairfield, 4-1, at Ohiri Field.
Heavy rainfall may have cost the Stags (4-5-2) their chance at payback this year.
Originally scheduled for yesterday evening, Fairfield’s home contest with the Crimson (4-4-1) was postponed indefinitely on account of inclement weather.
The schools have not agreed on a make-up date.
The matchup would have been the Stags’ final non-conference game, while Harvard—currently on a two-game winning streak—has two non-league games still remaining: contests against Siena and Quinnipiac on Oct. 19th and 25th, respectively.
Both squads will welcome league rivals to their home fields this weekend, as the Crimson hosts Cornell Saturday morning at Ohiri Field, and Fairfield takes on conference rivals Manhattan and St. Peter’s.
The matchup would have been the teams’ fourth in as many years.
The Stags have gone winless against Harvard during the three previous years, scoring only once.
The two schools played to a scoreless tie in 2008.

It is a weekend of opportunity for the Harvard women’s tennis team, as it travels to Flushing, N.Y., to compete in the USTA Billie Jean Invitation. The competition, which will be held Oct. 9th-11th, will offer the squad a chance to develop its young players and gain more court-time before beginning Ivy competition.
The Crimson recently finished competing in the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships in Los Angeles, Calif. Co-captains Holly Cao and Samantha Rosekrans competed in the doubles qualifying draw of the tournament while the rest of the team was defeated in the pre-qualifying rounds. Cao also advanced to the singles qualifying round, but lost to NC State’s Sanaa Bhambri, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Look for Cao, Rosekransas, and sophomore Hideko Tachibana, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, to lead Harvard in the Billie Jean Invitational. With only one senior on the squad this year, the invitational will be an excellent opportunity for the squad to prove itself and give the younger players a chance to shine as well.

As the news of Grammy-winning rapper Wyclef Jean accepting a job offer from the department of Africana Studies at Brown University reaches Ivy League ears, it’s fitting that this week’s edition of Around the Water Cooler is all about top-notch performance and uncharacteristic moves.  Though not literally taking the stage, Ivy League teams and individual athletes from each of the eight schools are holding their own on a national scale. In just a minute, we’ll look at a few Ivy Leaguers who have secured national rankings, some athletes who are bringing their A-game on and off the field, and a noteworthy event about to happen right in our backyard (and, no, I’m not talking about the free showing of The Social Network tomorrow night). We’re hanging out Around the Water Cooler, you know how it is. 
Let’s start with a healthy dose of Ivy League football. Sophomore quarterback Sean Brackett of Columbia, one of the League’s Co-Offensive Players of the Week, tied the school record of five touchdowns in a single game this week (set in 1942 and tied in 1982) as the Lions dominated Princeton, 42-14.  Another sophomore QB, Penn’s Billy Ragone, earned Co-Offensive Player of the Week honors as well by securing his team’s 35-28 victory over Dartmouth with the winning touchdown in overtime. On a different note, Cornell sophomore QB Josh Vick is making an impact off the field, leading the Big Red community, alongside women’s basketball coach Dayna Smith, and helping the Be The Match Foundation raise money for bone marrow donation and awareness.
The Brown men’s soccer team recorded a victory against No. 22 St. John’s this week—its first ever against the Red Storm—and, in doing so, earned a No. 13 national ranking. An early strike from junior midfielder Evan Coleman gave the Bears a lead they held onto for almost 88 minutes on the way to a 1-0 win.
Evidently, it was a good week for Columbia in multiple sports, as the Lions’ women’s soccer team garnered national accolades of its own. Columbia claims the second-best save percentage in the nation with 0.915. The team also boasts a 0.47 goals-against average, which is eighth-best nationally.
Some more of this week’s top performances came in the woods of Wisconsin, as the men of Princeton cross-country dominated on the trail. The team earned a No. 12 national ranking, the highest ranking of any Ivy League team since 1997, after finishing third at the Wisconsin Invitational behind a blazing first place effort from junior Donn Cabral. Harvard senior Claire Richardson came up big for the Crimson at the Wisconsin Invitational as well, leading the women’s cross country team to a sixth place finish. Richardson secured ninth place overall in the field of 202 runners.
The Tigers’ field hockey team continues to be one of the best in the nation, earning a No. 3 ranking despite losing its first game of the season to No. 14 American on Sunday. The team has demolished its first three Ivy League opponents, defeating Dartmouth, Yale, and Columbia by at least five goals each for an aggregate score of 22-2.
In the under-the-radar world of Ivy golf, Dartmouth freshman Sarah Knapp made some noise this weekend with a win at the ECAC Women’s Golf Championships. Battling tough weather and even tougher competition, Knapp responded to the rain to earn the overall victory by two strokes. While we’re on the topic of lesser-known college sports, two Yale sophomore sailors, Emily Billing and Claire Dennis, qualified for the Singlehanded National Championships with impressive performances this weekend for the No. 3 Bulldogs.
The Crimson men’s and women’s lacrosse teams are slated to host the U.S. men’s national team and the U.S. women’s senior national team, respectively, on Columbus Day weekend. The exhibition matches, which are a part of U.S. Lacrosse Stars and Stripes Weekend, kick off preseason action for Harvard this year with the toughest of competition.

Students looking to stay close to Yard for their meals may have one less option thanks to Lowell House's new dining restrictions.
Lowell, adding itself to the seemingly ever-increasing number of Houses with dining restrictions, will now be restricted to House residents (plus one guest) during lunch on Monday through Friday, Sunday brunch, and from 6 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. during dinner on Sunday through Thursday.
Students in Cabot will still be able to eat in Lowell House during lunch.
“If you have been to Lowell at all recently, you may have experienced the long waits for food and incredible over-crowding,” wrote Lowell HoCo Chair Julia M. Fifer ’11 in an e-mail to members of other House Committees explaining the new restrictions.
Lowell established similar restrictions last February in an effort to reduce crowding in the dining hall.
A house-by-house list of dining hall restrictions can be found here.
On the bright side, at least the Quad doesn’t have any complicated restrictions.

In his final season at Harvard, former Crimson wrestler JP O’Connor ’10 faced 35 opponents. O’Connor blew past them all en route to a national championship.
But O’Connor—who is currently training for the 2012 Olympics—had one more challenger to overcome before he could begin thinking about packing his bags for London: a nerdy sportswriter with about as much combat experience as a Quaker.
In the second edition of Crimson Faceoff—The Back Page’s new video series that pits Crimson sportswriters against varsity athletes—one Crimson sportswriter takes him on.
Could O'Connor keep his perfect record in tact? See for yourself by checking out The Crimson’s video footage.

Shaquille O’Neal's got the smarts to take classes at Harvard or MIT. At least that’s what Shaq, who plays center for the Boston Celtics, told the Boston Herald.
 
“Nobody knows that I’m a camouflage geek.”
Wait, what does that mean?
“It means I like to give people one impression…“I don’t want people to know I’m smart. So I call myself a camouflage geek.”
 
So what does this mean for the 7-foot-1, 325 lbs behemoth?
“If I wanted to, I could attend a couple of classes at Harvard and hold my own…That’s how smart I am. I could even go to MIT if I had enough time, and actually hold my own.”
Remember when Shaq revealed that he was also a rapper? How about a movie star? (Where would the world be without Kazaam?) And also, a TV star. Shaq apparently can do it all.
In any case, Shaq, if it's so easy, why don’t you come over and code this Flyby correspondent’s CS50 problem set?
“I’m not going to do it unless it can help me,” he said to the Herald. “I don’t want to do it just to see if I can do it. If it’s not going to help me toward a doctorate or another degree, than [sic] I’m not going to do it.”
Sure…
