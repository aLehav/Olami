Note: This review contains spoilers.
About halfway through the second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” it became painfully obvious that the writers were playing a game of “Will she? Won’t she?” with us: Will June escape the Gilead? Or will she be captured in the process?
Strangely enough, the season finale’s answer to both of these questions is “no.” June (Elisabeth Moss) doesn’t escape the Gilead, even though she’s been given her third opportunity to. And it’s not because an unexpected twist of fate caught up to her—for example, conveniently going into labor right as you’ve discovered a cabinet of non-perishable food and a luxury getaway car. It’s because June chooses to stay, handing off her baby to Emily (Alexis Bledel) and letting her would-be escape van leave her behind. Turns out, third time’s not the charm when a show values their cash flow more than their storytelling. Just a week after its Season Two debut, “The Handmaid’s Tale” was renewed for a third run, which means its writers needed to come up with new content. Unfortunately for us, they’ve equated that to trapping June in Gilead, again. And again.
This constant repetition is suffocating the story—and Gilead is already a suffocating place. That’s its entire premise: deranged, misogynistic restrictions. That’s not to say that this can’t be productive—Gilead is supposed to be symbolic for what the United States could devolve into. But “The Handmaid’s Tale” can’t seem to move past indulging in cruelty that seems to be there just for the shock value. The handmaids are rounded up for a fake hanging. June is raped while heavily pregnant. Eden (Sydney Sweeney)—a 15 year-old girl—is drowned in a swimming pool in front of an audience.
And in the finale, Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) gets her pinkie sliced off for reading the Bible. The show’s tragedies have become tedious because they only exist to prove that Gilead is miserable. But after two seasons of evidence, we get the message. These showcases of brutality no longer develop the story or the characters or add any nuance to the heavy themes with which the show battles.
“The Handmaid’s Tale” is capable of moving beyond trauma porn—it just chooses not to. There have been glimmers of potential for political change: Canada withdrawing its diplomatic relations with Gilead, Serena Joy writing her husband’s documents, the wives uniting to make the case for women’s literacy. But everything is futile. At the end of the second season, we’re back to where we started as June walks away from her chance at safety, presumably because, as indicated by a glowy flashback, she wants to stay in Gilead to find her first daughter. It’s a frustrating scene, one that inspires a specific argument: Was this decision respectable or was it idiotic?
But don’t fall for this red herring debate. June’s choice was disappointing not because of its rationale, but because it brought the storyline nowhere. Not even Elisabeth Moss’s trademark scowl, which the camera dramatically lingers on in the last scene, can save this moment.
Thirteen episodes later, and we’ve barely moved an inch. The show’s back-and-forth game is proving to be nothing more than a marketing tactic—a way for the writers to find easy Season Three content that doesn’t require much more world-building. It’s quite contradictory to the branding of “The Handmaid’s Tale” as a political force, something that should inspire more action from its viewers than a line of tone-deaf wine. But how can “The Handmaid’s Tale” demand action from us when it stays stuck in its own rut with shallow motives? Its second season always showed us how bad things could get for America, but it never asked the important questions of how we got there, and how we can change things for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Asians may be called the “model minority,” but it doesn’t seem like we’re actually wanted in schools. We are implicitly accused of taking up too many spots in elite New York City high schools, so the mayor’s new plan proposes to scrap the admissions exam in favor of less objective criteria. At the same time, we are fighting elite universities like Harvard in court over charges of unfair discrimination.
Negative Asian stereotypes do not garner us much sympathy though. We have unappealing personalities. We are only good at tests, and we are only good at those because we spend all our time studying. Perhaps, then, we don’t really deserve our spots in the upper echelons of American education.
The misconception that Asians are somehow “gaming the system” is insulting and inaccurate. It’s true that many Asians resort to extensive test prep to do as well as they do on admissions exams like the Specialized High School Admissions Test in New York City and the SAT for colleges. But it’s dishonest to lump in poor Asian families who sacrifice to pay for test prep with rich people (of any race) who easily afford it. Forgoing vacations, refraining from buying amenities, and even scrimping on food to pay for test prep are not gaming the system.
They are sacrifices. Maybe these sacrifices are crazy or counterproductive; there are certainly arguments to be made against them. Regardless, these are valid choices that are open to people of any race and that have proven to be, on the whole, effective. The people who make these choices may be playing the game the hardest and taking most seriously the prize—which is more than just a seat in a great school and may be no less than the American Dream itself. But they are not gaming the system.
Of course, there are groups who really aren’t playing by the rules: the disproportionately white legacy students who sneak their way onto the Harvard "Z-list," a deferred admissions pool for a small number of students each year; and the rich kids whose parents donate $2.5 million to the school before they apply, like Jared Kushner. It’s obvious that people with power and money can game the system.
The more insidious gaming comes within the system itself, in admissions offices and departments of education. The most egregiously unfair treatment must be Harvard’s consistently lower “personal” ratings for Asian-American applicants, at times given without even meeting the students. In the case of New York City, it is unfair to set one standard (the SHSAT), not like the kind of people who succeed under that standard, and then to change the standard in order to achieve the outcome that was desired all along. Quotas—as admissions statistics over the years suggest  exist at elite schools, however unofficially—are also gaming the system.
There should be more pushback against all this admissions rigging against Asians—especially among liberals, who tend to pride themselves on their championing of minorities and equal opportunity. But instead, it is Bill de Blasio, the progressive mayor of a very liberal city, spearheading the plan to get rid of the admissions exam. It is Harvard, a predominantly liberal university with respect to its students and faculty, defending its affirmative action policies.
But this too should be no surprise. Because the real game being played here is politics—racial politics, especially. Politics is why de Blasio, longing to be seen as a national progressive leader, focuses so much on just eight specialized high schools instead of tackling the root of the problem—the many subpar schools that are currently failing primarily black and Latino students. Politics is why Harvard, in order to diversify its student body, continues to hold onto race-conscious affirmative action, the results of which look good in photo spreads, instead of emphasizing socioeconomic diversity, which doesn’t photograph as easily but is more merit-based. Politics is why, when asked the reason that Asians are demographically overrepresented in elite education, liberals are quicker to point their fingers at the ones who have succeeded than at the ones who haven’t.
So if anything, Asians have been playing themselves. Asians overwhelmingly vote Democrat, but the Democrats have taken us for granted, excluding us from their definitions of diversity when it suits other people of color. Asians do what they can to get into the best American institutions, but it seems like those institutions are doing just about everything they can to keep us out.
The education fiascoes in New York City and at Harvard have revealed just how badly we’ve been played. At least the response—the Asians speaking up and gaining more attention across the country—has been heartening. In politics, we need to claim the narrative, fight for what we earn, and stop being political pawns. And the record should be clear: We don’t game the admissions system. In any case, education is far too serious to be a game.
