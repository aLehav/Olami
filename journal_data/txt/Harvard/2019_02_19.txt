“We don’t judge. We’re the Non-Judging Breakfast Club. We’re your best friends.”
The earnest way Blair Waldorf delivers that line as she reassures companion and it-girl Serena van der Woodsen almost sells the ensemble cast as something that they’re fundamentally not.
Revisiting “Gossip Girl” nearly a decade later, one feels a real absence of glamor that the show’s protagonists once had. It’s not because they’re malicious people; the audience was always acutely aware of that. It’s not because they’re rich, or gaudy, or costumed either; it’s nice for viewers to get a bit of aesthetic escapism, however unrealistic.
No, the real issue is that the narrative of the Manhattanites hinges on the wrong side of the power dynamic. Their identities are defined not by personal depth or redeeming qualities, but rather in relation to others — in particular, those they deem below them. The Basses have a private jet, the Waldorfs have a fashion line, while the Humphreys have, well, a Brooklyn loft. The central tension of the show, Dan Humphrey’s intrusion into the cultivated ecosystem of the Upper East Side, just underscores how unearned the self-importance of these characters is. Gossip Girl’s characters never act because they have a story to tell. They simply to react to the world which is moving around them, most often to interpersonal conflict centered on issues of class. How many times have you heard one of them name drop a designer before crying over “belonging to different worlds”? The faux-concern gets stale.
“Gossip Girl” is meant to be guilty pleasure fodder, and this criticism acknowledges that. But one does not get to straddle kitsch and bona fide character development and make credible claims to both. As the overwrought dialogue illustrates, there are far too many moments which indicate that show writers genuinely believed fear of Brooklyn could pass for six seasons worth of personality. Replaying scenes of the main cast shunning outsiders with victorious catharsis amid hugs and kisses, one can’t help but feel disdainfully unmoved.

Boston’s Institute of Contemporary Art opened its newest exhibit, “Ragnar Kjartansson: The Visitors,” this past Wednesday — a “monumental nine-channel sound and moving-image installation,” according to the museum’s press release.
To create the installation, Kjartansson filmed himself and other performers in separate rooms of a historic estate in upstate New York, all synchronously performing different parts of a musical arrangement. The arrangement was composed by Kjartansson and Davíð Þór Jónsson, and Kjartansson described it as “feminine nihilistic gospel song.”
The installation is set up to fill the entire room. Two massive screens stand back to back in the center, while seven others line the walls. Each screen has its own speaker, so the sound that fills the room varies from place to place. Though the performers begin in separate rooms on separate screens, they slowly come together over the course of the 64 minute performance, leaving some rooms empty and congregating in others.
Several visitors remarked on the effect of spatially navigating the exhibit.
"An interesting thing for me was trying to piece together the different parts of the house in each of the different channels — watching, ‘Ok, people are leaving from this screen; oh, they’re showing up over here,’” Joshua D. Anderson, a visitor at the exhibit, said.
Museum patron Lydia M. Vanderburg also spoke to the unique spatial aspects of the exhibit.
“As you walked around the room, you’d hear one performer more strongly, but because of the acoustics of the room, you could still hear everyone. That was really surprising; I’ve never been in an exhibit like that,” Vanderburg said.
Some visitors, however, said that they had mixed feelings.
“It drew me in right away, because you had to run around and see where all the different sounds were coming from, but once that wore off it was kind of, like, just a song,” David L. Nickerson, visitor and ICA member, said. “It kind of reminded me of people I went to college with that I don’t talk to anymore, intentionally.”
The exhibit’s title, “The Visitors” — a reference to ABBA’s final album — is applicable to more than just the performers themselves. Audience members themselves become visitors in the exhibit’s world: Kjartansson strums an instrument and sings in a bathtub while another artist plays sitting on the edge of a bed, with someone who is presumably a lover still naked under the covers. Even the musicians who sit in more traditional recording settings seem absorbed in creating the music as a private and organic act. As they come together, the performers chat, smoke, and pour drinks before congregating in a single frame outside the house to set out across a field together, still singing.
“It feels like you’re part of this group of people for a while,” Christine L. Costello, an ICA visitor, said.
The lyrics that the performers are singing are taken from the poem “Feminine Ways,” written by Kjartansson’s former wife Ásdís Sif Gunnarsdóttir. For the first stretch of the song, the lines “Once again I fall into / My feminine ways” are sung again and again, with a variety of musical structures. Then, later: “There are stars exploding / And there is nothing you can do.”
The dimension of the lyrics struck a thematic chord with Vanderburg.
“I feel like the feminine is something that gets a little less exposure in art than it should," Vanderburg said. “It was really interesting to see these different people playing different instruments, of different genders, in different parts of the same building… They’re walking away singing this song that is very much like a unifying anthem from a performance that was all about how segregated they were in different parts of the house.”
“Ragnar Kjartansson: The Visitors” will be on display through July 28. The Institute of Contemporary Art offers free admission with a Harvard ID.
Correction: Feb. 21, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Christine L. Costello as an ICA member. In fact, she is a visitor.

With the immediate fame of “Mean Girls” and “The Notebook,” the modern chick flick was born in 2004. Millennials are sure to cite films like these as their favorite childhood movies — and it’s not something to complain about. While there were over 16 different chick flicks released in 2004, here are the top five cult classics.
5. "The Prince and Me"
The classic girl-hates-boy-then-girl-loves-boy trope was cemented with the fame of this wonderfully sweet film. And who doesn’t love a good princess story? College student Paige is immediately annoyed by classmate Eddie, but then begins to fall in love with him — of course. Until, that is, she finds out he’s the Crown Prince of Denmark. The film leaves us with the typical dilemma women faced in the early 2000s: Marry a prince, or follow your dreams?
4. “White Chicks”
If you didn’t watch this film without your parents knowing, did you really have a childhood? In order to protect two rich heiresses from a kidnapping scheme, two black FBI agents adopt the ultimate disguise by becoming white teenage girls. Raunchy and suggestive, the film includes a few infamous scenes, including the convertible scene in which the friends sing Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles” (a song loved by Terry Crews, who plays one of the FBI agents), and the club dance-off scene, which boasts over 11 million views to date on YouTube.
3. “13 Going on 30”
Nearly every child has wished that they were older with the freedom to do whatever they want. Jenna makes this very wish for her thirteenth birthday and wakes up the next day only to find she has been fast-forwarded into the life of her thirty year old self. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner, this movie is essentially the sassier version of Tom Hanks’s 1988 film “Big,” featuring a “Thriller” dance scene.
2. “The Notebook”
That kiss though, am I right? This film transformed Ryan Gosling into an immediate heartthrob, and set the standard for epic love stories everywhere. According to director Nick Cassavetes, however, Gosling and co-star Rachel McAdams (who plays the main love-interest, Allie) apparently couldn’t stand each other when filming, despite having ridiculous chemistry on-screen.
1. “Mean Girls”
Based loosely on the self-help book “Queen Bees and Wannabees” by Rosalind Wiseman and then adapted by Tina Fey, “Mean Girls” is one of the best chick flicks of all time. It stars young Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Amanda Seyfried, as well as many of Fey’s castmates on SNL, such as Amy Poehler (who plays Regina’s mom), Tim Meadows (who plays Mr. Hall), and Ana Gasteyer (who plays Cady’s mother). Grossing over $129 million worldwide and with a sequel in 2011 and a Broadway adaptation in 2018, the success of “Mean Girls” is unparalleled. No matter how many times we watch it, somehow it never grows old or out of touch. Even Ariana still gives a nod in her iconic “thank u, next” music video.

The Harvard Art Museums’ newest exhibit, “The Bauhaus and Harvard,” which opened on Feb. 8, showcases the interconnected history of the Bauhaus school — now 100 years old — with Harvard itself.
The term “Bauhaus” refers to a crafts and fine arts school founded by Walter Gropius, an architect and scholar who later joined Harvard’s Department of Architecture. Although the school was open for just 14 years between the two World Wars, the school is far from forgotten today. The exhibit’s 200 works by 74 artists encapsulate the diversity of both the Bauhaus and of Harvard’s own collection, which is typically housed at the Busch-Reisinger Museum. It includes a wide variety of artwork, from paintings by Lyonel Feininger to household contraptions by Josef Albers and Herbert Bayer to textiles by Gunta Stölzl and Anni Albers.
Berlin-based artist and author Judith Raum was the guest speaker at the opening celebration. Her speech and film, “Fabric In Space, Fabric Out of Space,” both attest to the exhibit’s commemoration of lesser-known figures. One of those figures was Otti Berger, a Bauhaus weaver, who despite her instrumental role in the school, could not build her legacy after being lost to the Holocaust.
Raum’s film, now on display at the Lightbox Gallery, shows a series of photographs of Berger’s textiles accompanied by a reading of her text, “Fabrics in Space,” on the tenets of weaving. The photographs display textiles lit and folded to show how their materials glisten and fray, mirroring Ernst Nipkow’s photography on view in the exhibit.
Raum lauded Berger, whom she said “managed to pull weaving out of an obscurity, which was the effect of the textile medium being traditionally associated with crafts and seen as a female medium, and as such, widely debased, also at the Bauhaus.”
While this exposition of Otti Berger and weaving as an art is central to the exhibit, “The Bauhaus and Harvard” contains a plethora of other forms and instrumental artists. Laura Muir, the exhibit’s curator, prefaced many of these additional items at the opening exhibition.
“I think one of the biggest choices was to focus on three main areas,” Muir said in a later interview. According to Muir, those three areas were “looking at material produced at the Bauhaus in Germany, material that represented the influence of Bauhaus instruction in the United States, then material related to the Harvard Graduate Center.”
As the exhibit snakes around, there are wall hangings of exemplary textiles, paintings by artists like László Moholy-Nagy, and architectural plans by Gropius and colleagues. “Verdure,” a painting by Bayer that used to span the dining hall at the Graduate Center, centrally occupies a back wall. Pieces such as a chair designed by Marcel Breuer, a lamp, tea glass holders, a chess set, and a curtain used to separate dormitories at the Graduate Center reference the practical and everyday appearances of the Bauhaus. The exhibit features artists like Lucia Moholy, who — despite not being credited for much of her work — contributed to the permeation of the Bauhaus’ widespread brand.
“The Bauhaus and Harvard” is not limited to the primary exhibit at the Fogg Museum. Muir said that it also includes a complementary exhibition at the Harvard Law School and at the Houghton Museum, interpretive signage at the Graduate Center, three courses this semester, and broader campus outreach.
“I like the exhibit because it gives a synoptic summation of all of the collections that Harvard has of the Bauhaus,” Erin A. Freedman, Harvard graduate student, said. “I had taken a class on the Bauhaus before, and I was really interested in the emphasis they put on female weavers and feminist approaches to abstraction.”
Muir also highlighted the role of students in the Bauhaus, which was foremost an instructional institution.
“Harvard played this major role in the reception of the Bauhaus in the United States,” Muir said. “And one of the most exciting things I think, is that the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art, which was an undergraduate group, staged the very first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States here at Harvard … it was really a student effort.”

From Janelle Monáe's "Dirty Computer" to Troye Sivan's "Bloom" and King Princess's "Pussy is God," "20GayTeen," as Hayley Kiyoko (aka "Lesbian Jesus") dubbed it, felt like a watershed year for queer pop music. If Kelsie Hogue's debut album as Sir Babygirl, "Crush on Me," is any indicator, "20BiTeen" is already off to a promising start. Hogue, who identifies as bisexual and non-binary, makes experimental bubblegum-with-bite pop reminiscent of a cross between some of the great BGLTQ pop music of the past year — think Kiyoko meets SOPHIE — and yet wholly original. “Crush on Me” is a luminous debut, glowing with the light of a new star in the pop cosmos.
Hogue’s name might sound familiar: The BU theater grad previously performed in the Allston music scene, fronting groups like noise rock group Leigh Cheri. While Hogue’s current sound is quite different, her music has a punk verve and a thrilling energy. “Crush on Me” opens with Hogue’s stunning debut single “Heels,” a dazzling DIY disco track that brings to mind the early work of Hogue’s Father/Daughter Records labelmate Shamir. The track is lyrically and sonically inventive from the wry chorus (“I'm running home with my heels on my head… Lights shine brighter when there's tears in your eyes / I guess that's a nice surprise”) to the anthemic bridge (“You don't know me anymore / I changed my hair,” its last line repeated three times like incantation). The bridge is evocatively followed by a wordless cry straddling the line between the ecstatic and tragic.
That space between the heights of joy and the depths of sorrow is one that Hogue returns to repeatedly in her music. In “Flirting with Her,” Hogue captures the exhilaration and torment of a crush. From the wonderfully over-the-top opening lines “Flirting with her is like butterflies screaming / Taking off into the night” Hogue builds a series of similes that evoke the feeling of first being interested in someone all over an early-00’s style pop punk guitar line. On the bridge, Hogue physically captures the all-consuming intensity of flirting in the lines, “She left her name on my lips / I don’t think I’ll ever get over her hips / Or ever feel like anything else exists / When she texts me ‘hey.’” Even the experiences that words can’t quite capture, Hogue manages to express too — the bridge concludes with a perfect wail of agony.
This idea that to flirt is to flirt with risk is further explored in “Haunted House.” The track perfectly captures the nightmarish quality of so many house parties. Hogue sings with ironic glee in the chorus, “This party's just another haunted house / I can't wait to lose all my friends tomorrow … I can't wait to carry it with me forever.” Over strings and shimmering, upbeat synth’s Hogue winds her way through this house of horrors becoming increasingly inebriated (“One step in and I’m three drinks deep / watering that big secret I keep,”) and isolated (“no one knows the difference from my laughter and my screams”) only to be caught flat-footed by desire in the bridge. In capturing the bewildering, overwhelming experience of a party, this track is a near-perfect anthem for the socially anxious and ambivalent.
The album concludes with the title track and self-described outro which is part mumbled bubblegum and part sweetly-silly sketch about self-love. “So...uh...I have a new crush,” Hogue coyly confesses. She continues, “uh, it’s on me...I’m not tryna...project too much into the future but I do have a good feeling about this one.” The same could be said for Hogue’s pop career, which is deservedly taking off with this delightful debut.

Spring term can be a challenging time. The new year has just begun, the days are long and cold, and winter break seems like a distant dream. To help you make it safely through the coming weeks, I’ve compiled this playlist.
Long Weekend (Feb. 18 - Feb. 24): “More, More, More” by Andrea True Connection
We all love Presidents’ Day — not so much because we love the president, but because it allows us to enjoy a long, relaxing weekend three weeks into the semester. And what’s a better way to celebrate this wonderful occasion than listening to one of the best classics of the disco era?
Week #5 (Feb. 25 - March 3): “All Dead, All Dead” by Queen
As the second month of the semester begins, you might wonder, just like Brian May, why you still live on. “All Dead” might not provide an answer, but it’s such a brilliant song.
Pre-Midterms (March 4 - March 10): “Habib Galbi” by A-WA
Right before midterm season, these three Israeli sisters of Yemini descent will make you want to put down the books and dance on a table at Widener. The song, whose title means “love of my heart” in Arabic, fuses traditional Yemenite tunes with hip-hop. Listening to it might be the highlight of your week.
Midterms: (March 11 - March 17): “Work Bitch” by Britney Spears
The Queen of Pop couldn’t have phrased it better: You want an A in Ec 10b? You better work, bitch.
Spring Break (March 18 - March 24): “Oh! You Pretty Things” by David Bowie
The days are getting longer, nature is born anew, and for 10 days, you don’t have to go to class. Whether you’re in Cambridge, back home, or elsewhere, Bowie is excellent company, as always.
Back to School (March 25 - March 31): “As Tears Go By” by Marianne Faithfull
Marianne Faithfull and Mick Jagger cry as they watch the children play. But hopefully, you are smiling as you’re crossing the Yard on your way to your first lecture after a wonderful spring break.
Week #10 (April 1 - April 7): “White Nights” by Psychic TV
As papers and exams accumulate on your desk or desktop, your nights are getting progressively shorter. This experimental, acid house music group from England might make you feel slightly better about it.
Three-quarters In (April 8 - April 14): “Non, je ne regrette rien” by Edith Piaf
Congratulations! You are now 75 percent into the semester. At this point, regrets will be of no use. So forget about that response paper you submitted late or that party you were too tired to go to and listen to some words of wisdom from the diva of the French chansons.
Almost There (April 15 - April 21): “Chega de Saudade” by João Gilberto
“Home is where the heart is / The funny part is / My heart's been right there all along,” reads the English version of one of the greatest bossa nova songs. Whether your heart is at Harvard or not, you can still enjoy the beautiful music of João Gilberto.
Two Weeks (April 22 - April 28): “Two Weeks” by Grizzly Bear
Literally. Two weeks of classes. Hang in there. And listen to Grizzly Bear.
Last Week of Classes (April 29 - May 5): “Finally” by CeCe Peniston
Listening to CeCe Peniston’s 1991 debut single — “the quintessential ‘90s dance song,” according to BuzzFeed — is the perfect way to celebrate the end of classes. If you’re looking for a song that will instantly make you forget about any exams on the horizon, “Finally” might be your best option.
Reading Period (May 6 - May 12): “Miss Butter’s Lament” by Harry Nilsson
In May 1968, when The Beatles was asked what their favorite American artist was, their answer was “Nilsson.” Reading period is a great opportunity to honor the work of this incredibly-talented — and widely-underestimated — singer-songwriter, that you might haven’t even heard of.
Finals Week (May 13 - May 19): “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor
You did it. You’ve spent afternoons at Widener and nights at Lamont; you’ve aced your midterms and attended every lecture. Now all you have to do is pull through finals. Why don’t you enlist the help of Gloria Gaynor?

Since the release of her first EP, “Intertwined” (2016), British singer-songwriter Dodie Clark has charmed audiences with a carefully curated brand. She poses with yellow backgrounds and overalls and eyeshadow, each photoshoot a series of meticulously organized messy buns and doe-eyed expressions. Her songs feature ukulele choruses like “Would you be so kind / As to fall in love with me” addressed to faraway fairy tale princes. She posts endearingly awkward vlogs about heartbreak and friendship in her floaty, dreamy British voice. She’s sweet, unassuming, vulnerable — and never a threat.
But there’s a problem — sometimes life doesn’t fit into your color-coded Instagram theme. Having so specific a brand can be limiting, and in her latest video, Dodie runs into a story that can’t be painted in yellow flowers. The result is “Monster,” following a mixture of cartoonish villains wandering through her fairytale world. Dolling its protagonist up in a matted greyish wig, paper-mache horns, and exaggerated makeup, the video fixates on the colorful reimagining of ugliness, not Dodie’s usual pursuit of beauty. At first, the facial features and mannerisms of her titular monster, eerily similar to Dodie’s own, almost endear him to the audience. His one-person meals and frustrated romantic advances resemble the likeable self-deprecation of her own narratives. But then he starts to grow angry, and violent, and by the end, he’s holding her bloodied heart up in front of a little restaurant decked out in fairy lights. The veneer of innocence has faded, and something else emerges, a person evil enough to force her to give her generous soprano a rest.
The exaggerated ugliness and cartoon-style scares signify more than just a shift away from Dodie and her particular kind of beauty. They’re a mirror for the ugliness that lurks beneath some relationships — and the seemingly harmless, frustrated protagonist.
For Dodie, that “monster” seems to be one person in particular. As she described it, the story behind the video was a confrontation with a particular ex-lover. Specifically, she said it was inspired by the moment “in which I sat opposite of someone who I once loved and who once loved me (in a way) and realised now was the moment they started to hate me.” The majority of fans speculate the lover to be her abusive ex-boyfriend of many years, and a person she’s talked about in several of her videos. Dodie’s right in realizing that the specter of domestic violence merits urgency, a song not trying to be cute. With the combination of whimsy and lurking ugliness of “Monster,” she strikes an interesting balance, making the danger of abuse and manipulation dangerous both because of and in spite of the saccharine, multi-colored facade that surrounds it. In an age of ever-more stylized celebrity, “Monster” explores the boundaries of what it means to have a “brand” — and when you need to step outside of it.

Andres Cerpa’s first collection of poetry is intense and devastating. Titled “Bicycle in a Ransacked City: An Elegy,” the collection has much to elegize: a father, a place, a family, a childhood. Always at the center of the ruminating, confessional poems is Cerpa himself, a young poet from Staten Island who is forced to care for his ill father, while dealing with drug abuse and depression as he enters adulthood. Cerpa’s voice is reminiscent of an adolescent Sylvia Plath writing Rainer Maria Rilke poems. To read this collection is to step into Cerpa’s mind — to enter a ransacked world, bleak yet beautiful.
In the final line of the collection, Cerpa writes, “I have learned the world’s secret: that all is lost, even the losing.” Much is lost in “Bicycle in a Ransacked City.” Most visible, however, is the loss of Cerpa’s father, who developed Parkinson’s disease at 44. Cerpa’s father is a figure of both love and horror in the collection. In “Seasonal without Spring: Autumn,” Cerpa says his father “became distant with disease the way a boy falls beneath the ice / before the men that cannot save him— / the cold like a forever on his lips.” Audible in these lines are Cerpa’s contradictory feelings towards his father. Facing the once brilliant man who now wears Depend diapers, Cerpa is both the scared boy of “At the Tree Line” and the helpless caretaker of “Portrait & Shadow” and “Fear of Intimacy.”
But Cerpa’s poems are about much more than his feelings. Behind Cerpa’s raw confessional poems is a careful symbolic structure that gives his free verse a sense of psychological unity. Death appears in many forms throughout the collection, often accompanied by birds. “Seasonal without Spring: Winter” finds the poet depressed, with “the page open to the forest of Dante’s suicides / while a blue bird cocks its head on the sill.” And “Buried in Darkness, Light” shows us the poet in a heroin haze on a train, watching “the light of decay” breathe “through its yellow teeth, clear as birdsong.” The origin of this association between birds and death becomes clear when Cerpa’s father describes Parkinson’s to him by saying, “This is what it does to you,” and gesturing, with trembling hands, to “so many birds rising in unison.” In many ways, this pairing is apt: Birds herald the new day, and Cerpa’s anxiety about the loss of time is never far from his fear of death.
The most evocative era in Cerpa’s life seems to be his childhood, as evoked by the ever-present bicycle symbolism. Bicycles bookend the collection, appearing in the title, on the front cover, and in an image of the poet’s father printed after the last poem. Yet the symbol of the bicycle is only alive in Cerpa’s memory: “Portrait & Shadow” contains a childhood flashback in which his father “lifts me onto the back of his bicycle / he pedals while I glide above the city in wonder.” Present bicycles appear decayed and battered: In “So Close to an Ending,” “the buried half of a wheel” represents the remnants of a bicycle left to rust, and in turn, Cerpa’s tumultuous relationship with adulthood. Cerpa is barely a young adult, and disease has destroyed his childhood, just as weather has rusted the bicycle. Throughout the collection, Cerpa struggles to build an adult identity from this wreckage of a childhood erased.
Cerpa’s search for maturity is compelling, but it is also one of his collection’s greatest weaknesses. The parts of “Bicycle in a Ransacked City” not about Cerpa’s father read like the work of a young poet. While this is understandable, it is also limiting. Cerpa seems to be interested in all the subjects young writers are supposed to find interesting. He smokes spliffs and walks around the city at night. He drops street names from Paris, Berlin, and New York. He gets blackout drunk and asks someone if they love him. He is enthralled by a bird tattooed on a girl’s back. These are all honest sentiments, and Cerpa articulates them well, but together they reduce the poems to an unusually high-quality specimen of the often cringy genre of verse about alienated young artists.
That said, Andres Cerpa is a poet with potential. His next collection, The Vault, is scheduled to come out in June 2021. Cerpa recently published three poems from The Vault in The Offing magazine, and they are promising. Light yet weighty, the three poems develop motifs from Cerpa’s first collection in more abstract, yet still lyrical verse. Every poem in “Bicycle in a Ransacked City: An Elegy” takes something from you. Each breaks your heart in its own surprising and sophisticated way. If Cerpa can write about new subjects with the same emotional power, he will cement his place as a poet to watch.

It was just Valentine's Day, so you might be looking for romantic music. Alternatively, you could just need some tunes to lift your spirits. A Trent Reznor instrumental playlist cannot help you with either of these objectives. But if you need distorted, minimalist instrumental music with industrial rock undertones, look no further — Trent Reznor, the king of industrial rock/metal and frontman for Nine Inch Nails, has been making it for over 30 years. From his breakout 1994 album “The Downward Spiral” to his Academy-award winning movie score of “The Social Network” (2010), there are simply too many good tracks to choose from. But that is just what I did. Here are the top 10 Trent Reznor instrumentals, ranked.
10. Hand Covers Bruise — “The Social Network”
Who hasn’t listened to the soundtrack of “The Social Network” on the way back from Lamont library, trying desperately to justify a 3 A.M. El Jefe’s burrito run as the price of restless genius? The next time you spend eight hours incompetently tracking down a segfault in your code, just put on the soundtrack to “The Social Network” and your fumbling attempts to repair self-inflicted damage will take on a sense of purpose and focus.
9. 35 Ghosts IV — “Ghosts I-IV”
“Ghosts I-IV” is Trent Reznor’s first almost entirely instrumental album, and at 36 total tracks, it’s a massive undertaking. This song will help you understand the “industrial” in industrial rock, because it sounds like a car parts factory as heard from the other side of a long metal tube, but in the best possible way.
8. A Warm Place — “The Downward Spiral”
This song serves as a brief moment of reprieve in an otherwise violent, abrasive album. It immediately follows “Big Man with a Gun,” which you should also listen to if only to understand why this mellow, reflective little tune feels so jarring and out of place.
7. Magnetic —“The Social Network”
The bouncy, distorted percussion underlying this sickening beat truly feels magnetic. Careful Trent Reznor listeners will note it’s nearly identical to “14 Ghosts II,“ but a song this good deserves to be released more than once.
6. Hidden in Snow — “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”
It’s ambient, minimalist, and perfect for the setting. The main riff is played on some unidentifiable instrument in a totally staccato fashion. It sounds like ice shattering.
5. Pilgrimage — “The Fragile”
It’s xenophobia and paranoia in the form of a song. It sounds a bit like klezmer, run through the standard Trent Reznor treatment: heavy synths, distorted guitar, etc.
4. 13 Ghosts II — “Ghosts I-IV”
“13 Ghosts II“ is easily the album’s most emotionally raw track, and is one of the top few among Trent Reznor’s whole body of work. XXXTentacion fans should check out his song “Snow,” a beautiful but underappreciated track which samples “13 Ghosts II” to powerful effect.
3. Hyperpower! — “Year Zero”
The first track in the album, it basically sounds like a civilization being destroyed — set to distorted electric guitar, of course. The screaming and explosions introduce the “Year Zero” narrative of a dystopian future brought on by some great calamity. Frankly, it’s awesome.
2. Another Version of the Truth — “Year Zero”
A barebones song consisting entirely of haunting piano overlaying a dissonant synth. It foreshadows 13 Ghosts II, as well as some of his later movie soundtrack work.
1. Just Like You Imagined — “The Fragile”
The greatest Trent Reznor instrumental isn’t a lonesome piano tune or some kind of abstract “soundtrack for daydreams,” as he once referred to “Ghosts I-IV.” It’s a bona fide rock song, with fills on the drums, guitar and piano solos, and a bridge. But Trent Reznor pulled it off without lyrics, and it’s not just adequate — it’s mind-blowing.

In her video for “5 dollars,” Christine and the Queens presents a wonderfully roguish take on the business of sex and the sexuality of business. Héloïse Letissier, the French pop singer behind Christine and the Queens, described the song as “dealing with some kind of love — the kind you can buy.” While five dollars might not seem like much for such services, the track is an upbeat, rousing ‘80’s-synth-pop inspired anthem with radically celebratory lyrics hailing the “eager and unashamed” and those who have had to struggle to be recognized, the “some of us who just had to fight / for even being looked at right.” In the accompanying video, Letissier pairs these punkish and puckish declarations of pride with cleverly complicated and taboo-challenging visuals.
The video opens with Letissier getting ready for her day — exercising, showering, moisturizing — after an evidently passionate night: She sports a bright red bruise on her neck, of which she amusedly takes note, and conspicuous scratch marks along her back. While attuned to her body and the physicality of her sexuality, the video resolutely does not objectify her; one never senses that she is in less than full control of how she is being portrayed. When she gets dressed, she selects clothes from a closet that is, as she described in the aforementioned statement to Vogue, “‘American Gigolo’ with a twist.” It contains an impressive collection of both dapper suits, of the type Richard Gere wore in the 1980 film, and immaculate black leather gear. While she dances in a sweetly silly way, complete with many finger-guns, she puts on a chest harness and briefly considers a matching chained collar. Then, in the video’s perfect turn, she buttons a crisp, pinstriped, white dress shirt over the harness and adds a grey glen plaid vest and trim blazer, to match. She completes her marvelously androgynous suit with neat pants, a red tie, and shimmering black gloves. Picking up a handsome leather briefcase, she briefly admires her dashing reflections in a tripartite mirror before walking out the door.
Letissier cautions against drawing sweeping conclusions from her visual choices and reminds us that what we see is a product of our own projected fantasies: “I wouldn’t advise to conclude anything too drastic, since you’re glaring yourself, in an obscene fashion — voyeur. The hustler is also someone who allows you to project onto him or her, before disappearing to leave you alone with your fantasmes.” However, it’s worth noting that the video is certainly suggestive. Where in mainstream American culture, leather gear is regarded as outré and business dress as clean and upright, by bringing together the two in this fashion, Letissier cleverly positions the business suit as the ultimate fetish item, in both senses of the word. That is, she reveals the business suit as both an object of cultural erotic fixation and one that is societally imbued with mythic powers. Through her appropriation and redeployment of this iconic symbol, Letissier radically challenges the iconography of elite male power — or at least, that’s my fantasme.

In its first episode, “Sex Education” seems to harken to the traditional high school drama series: A big, bad bully terrorizes the school’s social loner, while his best friend is in love with a girl who is seemingly out of his league. Even the jocks roam the school with their green and yellow letterman jackets. However, what at first seems cliché instead turns into an engrossing TV series about the lives of students at Moordale Secondary School.
Netflix’s new eight episode long series follows the lives of high-school students Otis Millburn (Asa Butterfield) and his best friend Eric Effiong (Ncuti Gatwa). Taking inspiration from his mom’s career as a sex therapist, Otis teams with social outcast Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey) to create a career for himself giving advice to his peers about their sex lives (or lack thereof) at their school. Despite being one of creator Laurie Nunn’s first works, her show twists overdone and overplayed character tropes through sharp, clever subversions. The show masterfully mixes humor with serious moments, producing a work that is insightful, captivating, and heart-warming.
Otis and his mother Jean (Gillian Anderson) have a dynamic relationship that is hilarious, but still relatable. While Jean is a sex therapist (and thus no stranger to uncomfortable conversations), Otis is sexually repressed, disgusted even by the idea of masturbating. Time after time, Jean pushes Otis to talk about his sexual issues, fracturing Jean’s relationship with her son by blending her professional job with her role as a mother. Despite the unique circumstances of their relationship, Otis and Jean are relatable because many experience similar issues of teenage independence and the infringement thereof. Regardless, this dichotomy is refreshing from the usual parent-child relationship characteristic of teen dramas.
Adding depth to the plot, Otis’s best friend Eric is one of the most compelling characters on television at the moment. As one of two openly gay kids at his school, Eric stands out. Known for being loud, Eric loves dancing and wearing fun, bright clothes. In his spare time, he practices applying makeup in his room, much to the chagrin of his overprotective father. Because of his family’s religious background, one would imagine that this parent-son relationship would be strained and unhealthy. Though there is strife in the relationship, Eric’s father does not push his son to change, instead he aims to protect his safety in a world still riddled with homophobia.
Maeve Wiley is another of the main characters, played compellingly by Emma Mackey. Despite the fact that this is the actress’s first role on the screen, she portrays her character comfortably. Even though the character builds a wall between herself and the world around her, small mannerisms, such as her constant nail biting, clue the viewer to her true psyche as a nervous and sensitive person. Her story makes her a particularly moving character. Her dad abandoned both her and her brother, leaving them in the care of her drug-addicted mother who eventually leaves as well. After her brother skips town due to a drug deal gone bad, Maeve is forced to fend for herself, turning to shoplifting and doing homework for others for money, and eventually running the business end of Otis’ sex clinic. The show focuses on her battle between survival and school, where she is a silent over-achiever.
Unfortunately for new viewers, the first episode does not uphold the quality of the overall show. The accents are the only clue for the setting, which is a vague mesh of America and England. The town is more forest than buildings, the school is American-ized with lockers and letterman jackets. Even the decade isn’t clear until PornHub is mentioned. It is also a fairly shocking work of television, to say the least. Though the viewer can expect sex to be featured, most viewers aren’t prepared to see a man’s genitals on their screens. Fortunately, the show’s unique concept and its humor is enough to keep a person invested.
Despite the hiccups of the first episode, complex relationships make “Sex Education” different from other shows of its genre. The viewer wants Otis to find his strength and ask the girl out. The viewer want Jean to break habits fostered by her failed marriage. The viewer wants Eric to feel comfortable in his character even while the world challenges him. Regardless of the character, the viewer wants them to succeed. This multidimensionality of the characters creates an interesting situation where this show does not have a “villain,” so to speak. Just as in real life, people are more complex than they seem to be on the surface, which the show reflects. More than anything, the characters are a reflection of the 21st century rather than worn out ideas of the past, and “Sex Education” gives hope to the future of teen dramas.

When you think of prolific, tentpole directors that anchor awards season darlings, like Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese, you’ll be forgiven if Alfonso Cuarón isn’t the first name to come to mind. Part of that is likely due to the rarity of his big screen projects: "Roma” is only Cuarón's fourth film over the past fifteen years, his previous three being “Gravity” (2013), a sweeping outer-space spectacle, “Children of Men” (2006), a dystopian science fiction thriller, and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” the third installment in the fantasy series (2004). Needless to say, that leaves Cuarón with an extremely varied — perhaps even fantastical — filmography in recent years. But his latest release returns to earth with the grounded reality of "Roma,” much of which Cuarón has based on his own childhood memories. Even working on a comparatively smaller scale than he has in his other films, Cuarón breathes life into the titular Mexico City suburb by giving "Roma" a vibrant, beating heart. The beauty of “Roma” lies with its powerful performances, stunningly detailed cinematography, and emotionally rich narrative, elements that are at times undermined by scenes verging on melodrama.
The film revolves around both the hardships faced by domestic worker Cleo Gutiérrez, played by Yalitza Aparicio in her feature film debut, and her relationship with the upper class family she works for — in particular, the matriarch of the family, Sofia (Marina de Tavira). At the core of this film are stunning portrayals of strength and resilience by these two characters with jarringly different socioeconomic backgrounds, as they make tough decisions after being abandoned by the men in their lives. Cleo faces difficulties with her boyfriend, Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrera), and Sofia’s irresponsible husband, Dr. Alexander (Fernando Grediaga), is on a vexingly prolonged “business trip.”
"Roma" centers on Cleo’s perspective, and even when her character faces adversity, Aparicio brings a careful generosity to her performance. It feels so natural that her gentle warmth is almost infectious. Cleo deals with Sofia’s children so well that they are perhaps more emotionally attached to her than they are to their mother. Nothing portrays this dynamic better than an early scene in which the family watches television with their arms around each other, and Cleo, after collecting used plates, sits on the floor next to the children on the sofa. An arm reaches out to her before Sofia calls for her service: There is a clear affectionate bond here, but class hierarchy takes precedence over Cleo’s personal relationship with the children. Cuarón interweaves some important socioeconomic context to illustrate this relationship to the audience, namely the stark divisions along class lines and the subsequent political tension between the employers and the employed. With a film already packed tightly with emotional baggage, this context often takes a backseat to the domestic struggles faced by these two characters (mainly Cleo), but is appropriately subtle to give the audience sufficient background.
Cinematography elevates the degree of realism in the film and allows for deep emotional connections with the characters. "Roma" is simply beautiful to look at. Cuarón shot the film in widescreen grayscale, and it’s all too easy to find oneself immersed in his luridly detailed scenes. The camera pans seamlessly through the rooms of the house, weaving in between columns and connecting long scenes of dialogue in takes that seem so natural and visceral that at times, it can feel as if one is encroaching on the privacy of the characters. Cuarón turns the commonplace into spectacle. From the meticulously constructed opening shot of a treacle of soapy water spilling over tiles to reveal in its reflection a window of light, to one of the most unique, cinematic car parking scenes, Cuarón focuses on unquestionably mundane objects and scenarios. Yet there is never a pedestrian shot in the film’s 135 minute runtime.
Many of these carefully crafted moments are so gut-wrenching and painfully resonant that they can be difficult to watch. One scene in particular tackles the theme of loss so intimately that it’s difficult to avert one’s eyes as Cleo tries helplessly to brave through not only a physically taxing struggle but also a grievous bereavement. As the film draws to its conclusion, Cuarón runs the risk of over-sensationalizing Cleo’s heroism in a particularly dramatic scene involving the children under her supervision. Ultimately, however, Cuarón compensates for this minor misstep with the final cathartic moments that wrap up the film, which are more than fulfilling. "Roma" is a poignant experience that will be imprinted in one’s memory for years to come.
“Roma” was released on Netflix in December 2018, has won two Golden Globes, and has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards.

This past weekend, scores of students, faculty, and alumni packed into Farkas Hall to witness something unprecedented: the first show by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals with female cast members. Many people in the Harvard community have worked together to pull off “France France Revolution,” from tech and lighting crews, to the seamstresses who produce the cast’s larger-than-life costumes.
But when it came time to bring this idea to life, arguably few were more involved than Michael R. Perusse ’20 and Max R. Weiss ’20. As the show’s two co-writers, they were responsible for creating a script that maintained the signature Pudding style in a show that is no longer all male.
As Weiss and Perusse described the experience, they said that they could not have been more excited about the opportunity to create the story for this historic show.
“When we heard the announcement at last year’s Woman of the Year show preview, we immediately texted each other: we have to write this show,” Perusse said. “We feel immeasurably honored.”
“We get to do more things, we get a larger talent pool, and it makes for an all-around better show having all genders in the cast,” Weiss added.
According to Weiss and Perusse, the show’s casting may have changed, but the fundamental structure remains. Like in previous years, the production still contains six men and six women — only now, those “men” and “women” can be played by people of any gender.
“In the script-writing process, we wrote the script not knowing what genders would be filling the roles,” Weiss said. “We wrote six roles that presented as female and six that presented as male. Once we came to casting, it was just like, she is hilarious playing him, he is hilarious playing her. Which we wouldn’t be able to do if we cast people who identified as males as our male characters.”
Once casting was over, the authors combed back through the script to tailor it to each performer.
“There’s a huge revision process, and any line in the show’s that’s said probably had potentially eight people think it was decent,” Perusse said. They estimated that only 20 percent of their original work made it into the final version, and they continued editing long into the rehearsal process.
“Two weeks leading up to the show we had line edits coming out twice a day, based on things like the length of the script, what set pieces could be made, and what we had available,” Perusse said. “It was really a lot of optimizing up until opening night.”
This year’s costumes, like the casting process, have many structural similarities to those of prior Pudding shows.
“Every costume would be the same no matter who is playing the character – the only differences would be the dimensions when it comes to the fitting room,” Perusse said. “The costumer begins working on designs around the same time as casting, as the script starts to become more concrete. There aren’t, as far as we know, any particular changes that are done because of the gender.”
The authors also talked about their relationship with the Pudding’s long tradition of cross-dressing and how it functioned within their story of star-crossed French lovers.
“We usually don’t talk about our cross-dressing as ‘drag,’ because it means something specific and has roots in the LGBTQ+ community,” Weiss said. “I think that our cross-dressing allows for a couple of different opportunities that make the show special. We’re able with the audience to laugh at the absurdity of gender construction and gender as a social construct because we can blur the lines a ton. And we get to just cast the best actor for the role.”
Cross-dressing has always been a part of Pudding shows, and Weiss and Perusse emphasized the importance of keeping “France France Revolution” true to the Pudding’s original spirit.
“We’ve watched videos of older shows to make sure that we stick to the same style,” Weiss said. “We aren’t doing a different style of show.”
Weiss and Perusse said that they heard positive feedback on their work from long-term Pudding members.
“The opening weekend show is where the majority of the alumni come back. Overwhelmingly, they were saying how excited they were to see this change come true. And also how amazed they were that so much of the ‘feeling’ remained,” Perusse said.
Now that the show has opened, Weiss and Perusse finally have the opportunity to sit back and watch how their final product is received.
“We haven’t touched the script,” Perusse said. After many months of fine-tuning, their job is finally finished. It’s now up audiences to make up their minds about “France France Revolution” — and the new era it signals in the long history of the Hasty Pudding.

With a premise that revolves around loss, family, betrayal, love, and healing, “Dear Ex” had the potential to go just about anywhere in terms of tone and artistic direction — from introspective to melodramatic to comedic. Disappointingly though, in reality, Chih-Yen Hsu and Mag Hsu’s Taiwanese Netflix film ends up touching on all these and more in presenting an emotional journey through grief, but without quite tying them together cohesively.
“Dear Ex” starts with a confrontation between the newly widowed Liu Sanlian (Ying-Xuan Hsieh) and Jay (Roy Chiu), the longtime gay lover of her late husband Zhengyuan (Spark Chen) and the unexpected beneficiary of his life insurance. Song’s teenage son Song Chengzi (Joseph Huang) rounds out the main cast and narrates with the fittingly moody and confused voice of a middle school student whose family has been wholly upended several times over. In an act of rebellion and in an effort to better understand his father, Chengxi leaves home to stay with Jay. The film follows these three characters as they come to terms with the loss of a man they all loved and the mess he left behind.
This film had massive potential to develop compelling characters with wildly complex relationships, but it falls short. The film’s standout performance comes from Chiu’s Jay, an over-the-top mess of a character whose callousness barely conceals the love and grief he never had permission to express openly. In particular, Jay’s unshed tears and expressions of longing, together with the gorgeously filmed flashbacks of his relationship with Zhengyuan, flesh out both men in a truly heartbreaking fashion. Unfortunately, the directors do not explore Chengxi with nearly as much depth, and he seems at times more like a plot device meant only to anger his mother. In theory, a young teen trying to understand his late father as an individual ought to make for a poignant narrative. While Huang delivers a reasonably compelling performance, Chengxi’s long, contemplative bouts of silence are not illuminating enough to justify his character’s supposed development.
Finally, Sanlian is a bit harder to empathize with despite the initial impression that she is in the most pitiable situation. As her own son states in the film, she lives her life as if everyone in the world owes her something, and at first viewing, her near-constant yelling is unbearably abrasive and gratuitous. Her shouting matches with Jay are also frustratingly irrational, even given her blatant homophobia. She insists that Jay return her husband’s life insurance despite making it so that he cannot actually take advantage of it. Then, she demands that he takes care of her son after Chengxi starts staying with Jay, all while threatening and insulting him. Yet, once Sanlian reaches her lowest point and breaks down in front of her son’s therapist, it becomes clear just how devastated she is over the fact that the family to which she has devoted her life is a lie. Her husband has chosen someone else even in death, and her son clings to the very man that symbolizes everything she has lost. Her near-constant outrage is a reaction to her total lack of agency in her most critical personal relationships. Her character may not be likeable — perhaps due to a performance that simply lacks nuance — but she is overwhelmingly human in her dramatic outbursts and is therefore compelling.
Despite the shortcomings in some of the actors, “Dear Ex” is beautifully filmed and directed. Chih-Yen Hsu and Mag Hsu frame each of the main characters right in the middle of long shots that make them seem isolated even when they are in scenes with others. Often, characters — Jay in particular — have their backs to the camera, their postures reflecting the shameful and hidden nature of the relationships at the center of this drama. The directors integrate frequent flashbacks through the narrative, and ironically, these hazy, warmly-lit romantic moments are the saddest of all because what could have been contrasts starkly with the messy reality of what has happened.
Just like its characters, “Dear Ex” is imperfect, yet emotionally gripping, as it presents broken individuals seeking resolution for their messy and interwoven pasts. Despite the film’s jagged edges, the storyline is quietly beautiful, and ultimately holds itself together with love instead of being fragmented by grief.

Alongside Nicki Minaj, Avril Lavigne brings back the sound of mid-2000s guilty pleasure music in her new single, “Dumb Blonde.” With the opening drums unmistakably reminiscent of the cheery, pep rally beat of High School Musical’s “We’re All in This Together” and Gwen Stefani's “Hollaback Girl,” the third single from Lavigne’s comeback album, “Head Above Water,” is both refreshingly nostalgic and rallying, even if the collaboration yields less than expected.
Laden with the same distinctive upbeat vocals as her iconic pop-punk single “Girlfriend,” Lavigne sings during “Dumb Blonde’s” infectious chorus, “I ain't no dumb blonde / I ain't no stupid Barbie doll / I got my game on (Just watch me) / Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong.” Relative to the chorus, the verses are anthemic: “Well, there you go again tellin' me where I belong / You put me on the bench, don't think that I can play strong / So quick to condescend, well, you think I'm empty, I'm not / You won't be so confident when I'm crushin' you from the top.” In a stream of Instagram posts celebrating the song’s release, Lavigne wrote, “We wrote Dumb Blonde as an anthem for anyone who has been stereotyped or talked down to. Keep your confidence and don't let anyone tell you how to be.”
While the critical activist might condemn a song like “Dumb Blonde” for having a simplistic message, the single’s uncomplicated, peppy style takes on an important feminist role. Fighting the “dumb blonde” stereotype is a classic angle; however, when laced into such an easy, unassuming song, the lyrics form a strong anthem. Indeed, the song and its handle on feminism perfectly captures the dumb blonde stereotype itself. Although the song, taken at face value, may feel like just another simplistic pop tune, repeated listening reveals that this is a gross underestimation (“you think I'm empty, I'm not”). In a world where even the word “feminism” evokes controversy, “Dumb Blonde” serves as a very real — if unobtrusive — ode to female empowerment.
The one downside of the song is Nicki Minaj’s potentially forgettable verse. While well-performed, it feels as though Minaj’s part was added only last-minute. Years of the pop/rap trend have unfortunately produced many songs in which the rap verse seems hardly anything more than an afterthought. With songs like Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood (Remix),” it’s clear that many pop stars in the industry exploit prominent rap artists for their talent and celebrity. While several of Minaj’s past features break this tendency and actually add a new flavor to each song, Minaj’s feature on “Dumb Blonde” has little substance outside of referencing her past works. Juxtaposed with Minaj’s unapologetic Barbie-esque characterizations on albums like “Pink Friday,” her verse on a single with a chorus featuring the line “I ain’t no stupid Barbie doll” feels disingenuous.
All this being said, Lavigne and Minaj’s radio-friendly single certainly has the potential to be a hit. A salute to songs played on iPod nanos and sang along to in the shower, “Dumb Blonde” is a shameless pleasure with an enticingly subtle feminist theme.

The clock read 2:08 p.m. and there was a steady, pattering rain hitting the plastic, tent-like roof that stood above El Arepazo’s outdoor seating section. A group of men, all around their late fifties by the look of their weathered faces and worn out tank tops or an errant guayabera (1), sat around the table and volleyed “panas” and “chamos” (2) around in an attempt to wait out the Florida rain that came and went as quickly as the smoldering flame of their cigarettes. At any given time, there were people outside of El Arepazo. When the sun was out and the humidity hung heavy in the air, the men lingered and leaned back in the metal chairs set out in front of the restaurant, picking at their “cachapas” or throwing back their fourth cup of “café — marroncito, por favor.” Their eyes wandered, hanging on this pair of legs stopping in for a “cachito” or that pair of arms balancing two trays of “arepas” for some community gathering. When no person beautiful or interesting enough for them happened by, their eyes settled, unfocused, on some point in the distance that lay between their lives in Doral and their memories in Caracas. When it rained, they shuffled under cover and waited for it to end, maybe pulling out a pack of cards or set of dominoes or, if one man felt particularly ready to have a little “bonche” (3) right there, a six pack of beer.
The languid lingering of the men outside transformed into a watering hole when you entered the restaurant, strangely contained by the two glass doors yet exuberantly active at most times of the morning and afternoon. Right now, however, at 2:08 p.m., the restaurant’s interior resembled its exterior a bit more than usual. A few customers sat scattered throughout, nursing coffees in little cups or indulging in a late lunch of “pabellon criollo.” The usual din was absent and the silence seeped into everything so even the “empanadas” resting in their glass cases looked deflated, like the cheese inside of them had hardened despite the stubborn heat and their puffed layers sagged with only empty air to support them. At all hours of the day, the six televisions mounted on the walls were on, usually playing some soccer or baseball game. On days like this, however, there were no men in jerseys to be seen. Instead, a newscaster with glasses on was talking to the camera, voice straining above the roar of the crowds behind her. The newscaster, who seemed like six different people as I sat in the middle of the crowd of tables and let myself be surrounded by the screens, was cutting in and out as she talked to the cameraman. She turned to the man next to her and thrust the microphone forward so he could speak. Together, the two of them were a sharp blur of red, yellow, and blue, no part of their body not covered in one of the three, if not all at once with a set of stars scattered on top. A flag with the same colors trembled in the man’s clutch, jerking in the wind so violently it blended it in with his shirt — a living, breathing “tricolor.” The camera jostled as he leaned forward, so close, and yelled.
“Today we have won! No turnout, complete abstention. It is a day of victory for Venezuela.”
His smile was large, teeth perfectly straight. As I watched his six reflections play back on the screens, a dizzying hall of political mirrors, I thought he might be an attractive man if I had seen him on any other day, in any other place. But today, in all his vibrancy and forced victory, he ached to believe his words too much.
In one word, he was desperate.

On May 20, 2018, Venezuela held long-awaited presidential elections between Nicolas Maduro, incumbent dictator of Venezuela, Henri Falcon of the Progressive Advance party, and Javier Bertucci of the Hope for Change party. The latter two candidates, through their own labels and those of the regime in power, were considered the opposition. In the mind of the diaspora, however, neither were candidates to be voted for. Both Bertucci and Falcon were accused of being “enchufado,” or plugged into the system — corrupt. Though these claims were difficult to corroborate due to the general lack of reliable information systems in Venezuela and the complicated nature of tracing money trails, there was widespread anger at the participation of Falcon and Bertucci in elections that were clearly rigged from the beginning. Feeling as if there was no other option to internationally demonstrate this broken system, Venezuelans in the interior and abroad agreed to abstain from the election in a historic break from previous opposition tactics. There had not been an opposition-wide call for abstention since the 2005 parliamentary elections, when this tactic backfired against the opposition and turned out a National Assembly with all 167 seats won by President Hugo Chavez’s Fifth Republic Movement and allied, pro-government parties. However, after election after election going to the ruling party (PSUV) despite robust and active opposition, the populace agreed on abstention to delegitimize Maduro’s regime and remove any false trappings of democracy still being used by the government. Venezuelans, weathered by decades of fighting against increasingly skewed electoral playing fields, decided to go with a cynical but effective tactic that would send a clear message.
In a way, what I heard the man tell newscaster Carla Angola that day was correct. It was a day of victory for abstention, with a record low turnout rate of 32.3 percent by the time the polls closed, showing that the vast majority of Venezuelans were against Maduro and his fraudulent elections. May 20 and the spark of hope it ignited within the opposition internationally would become a crucial turning point in the current movement by interim President Juan Guaidó and the majority of the Venezuelan population to oust Nicolas Maduro. The energy put in place by the diaspora that day will continue to linger all throughout the community, invigorating hubs like El Arepazo from Doral to Caracas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The planned removal of a century-old red oak tree near Andover Hall on the Harvard Divinity School campus due to renovations has sparked important debates over the necessity of protecting trees on the school’s property and across Cambridge. But in the wake of professional arborists’ assessments that the oak is in “irreversible decline” and poses severe risks to passersby if it were to fall, we accept the expert diagnosis of its health, and must sadly bid farewell to it.
We have been heartened by the thoughtful protestation that has accompanied the proposal of cutting down the tree. Preserving areas of nature in an increasingly urbanized world fosters community around those spaces, and we must always be aware of actions — such as the removal of this tree — that may threaten conservation of green spaces in our city. This is an opportunity for the Divinity School, and the University as a whole, to reaffirm its commitment to responsible development on its campus. Given our strong predisposition to keep as many trees as possible, we call on Harvard to provide comprehensive justification for actions like these.
As the open forums hosted by the Divinity School show, significant actions like the oak’s removal often have massive effects on the surrounding communities and residents. The University must focus on actively listening and responding to concerned parties as well as laying out thorough, transparent plans for building and maintaining a natural, beautiful campus. This process must take place not merely for affiliates of the University, but also for the communities in the broader Cambridge area. Moreover, the tree’s religious importance to some affiliates of the Divinity School remind us that tree canopies, green spaces, and scenes situated within nature have held great significance to people of all cultures, traditions, and religious denominations throughout history. Though the oak may not be on the Divinity School’s campus for much longer, we cannot understate or ignore the deep importance of environmentalism.
While we regret that this century-old oak may soon be no more, we ask Harvard to consider planting or providing a new tree in its place, among the other slated renovations on the Divinity School’s campus. Given the school’s commitment that Andover Hall “enrich” students’ spiritual lives, we believe the new tree can serve as a symbolic gesture showing respect for and perpetuation of these values.
To the University’s credit, it has already contributed significantly to the tree canopy around campus — officials have cited that Harvard has planted over 120 trees across its campus in the last decade. In that time, Harvard has only removed four, citing safety reasons. These efforts are commendable: not only do they make our surroundings more beautiful, but they illustrate the University’s commitment to environmentalism and sustainability. In continuing with these efforts, Harvard should demonstrate thoughtful plans to expand natural spaces in and around campus in the future While the planting of these trees is an admirable first step, the University must remain vigilant in its pursuit of green spaces, especially as the SEAS campus expansion in Allston nears completion.
While this red oak may leave our campus, we are hopeful that its significance will not be lost, and that the conversation sparked by this issue continue far into the future – far beyond the lifespan of any single oak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The arborists have spoken. And they have decided that a red oak tree, greeting visitors to Andover Hall for over a century, is in “irreversible decline” and a threat to campus safety. The decision bodes well for the Divinity School administration, which has sought since the fall to remove the tree in order to expand the school’s main building. Students, however, many of whom share a spiritual bond with the tree or just appreciate its friendly umbrage, have protested the school’s decision. And so a red oak, which before November I doubt many outside the Divinity School had ever taken serious note of, has become at once Harvard’s and perhaps the greater Boston area’s most controversial and most beloved tree.
But the University plows on as it so often does, dead set on a project the community seems to have increasingly little interest in: a café, a conference center, a multi-faith chapel (as spiritually meaningful as the last of these certainly is). These are certainly valuable goals for the institution, but at what cost? And is the language of cost really the one we should be using here? Or is that sort of language, that paradigm of institutional reasoning, precisely the problem?
Cambridge may be losing 31 acres of tree coverage per year due in part to construction, but surely this oak is not statistically significant in the struggle against environmental collapse. After all, the school has promised to plant more trees – healthier, younger, better-located trees – in place of this one. True, some students may express a sacred bond with this tree. But a multi-faith space is a far more important resource for these students, especially if they are feeling marginalized as pagans. The multi-faith chapel, moreover, serves as a clearly defined step toward a more inclusive future for an institution steeped in the history of religious elitism. Students, no doubt, will learn to value these new spaces, leaning into their educational utility, and the potential they provide for a tighter-knit community.
These are the undeniably noble aims of a 21st-century educational institution committed to diversity and inclusion, environmental change, and a strong community. It would seem then that the oak impedes the institutional progress of the Divinity School. But there is a greater symbolic value to the tree, and it shocks me that one of the world’s preeminent institutions of semiotic thought seems so unable to grasp it.
The battle between American institutional expansion and locally rooted spiritual practice has for centuries been waged over national landmarks. The debate came to a head when protestors blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline not merely for environmental reasons but for the sake of the Native American sacred sites it threatened. We should not forget that trees have often been at the heart of these confrontations. In 2015, for example, the U.S. Forest Service cut down a small grove of eastern red cedars in Shawnee National Park, named for a local tribal group which has long considered this cedar the “Tree of Life.” While the Forest Service had intended to improve the trail for visitors, opening up a magnificent vista, they were in fact cutting down the very trees which had drawn the sites first visitors.
The red oak is perhaps symbolic of Harvard’s illiteracy in the history of this destruction. Who knows how truly sacred this tree is? But that’s not really the point. Rather, the crux of the matter is that the oak is just another instance of institutions like Harvard prioritizing one set of collective interests over a smaller, more fragile, less heard, but still meaningful cluster of human experiences. The way the tree over many years has built itself into the sacred landscape of the Divinity School is beyond beautiful; the school should want to protect that for as long as it can.
Trees have long stood at the forefront of student and youth protests to protect the environment. Tree sitting is a well-established practice of civil disobedience, in which protestors occupy a tree in order to prevent its removal. In the summer of 1990, dubbed “Redwood Summer,” students and activists occupied redwoods in order to prevent loggers from cutting them down. Forty-four were arrested.
However many trees the school promises to erect in its stead, the red oak should remind us of the many trees to which students have been so literally attached. Environmentalism is not merely about planting more trees, but rather about respecting the place of existing ones. After all, the root of our environmental irresponsibility has always been the insidious notion that somehow our environment is replaceable, that four trees are better than one.
Like so many universities, Harvard continues to struggle with its relationship with student interests, often claiming a paternalistic position of knowing what is best for students over and against the spoken desires of students themselves. I wrote an op-ed at the beginning of this month describing the University’s planned removal of the HOCice, a nearly one-hundred-year-old student office space, which has served as a social safe haven for generations of students. Like the U.S. Forest Service at Shawnee, the University has a list of very good reasons to remove the office, not least house renovation and the elimination of locked-door social spaces. But that’s not what students want, and it’s certainly not what fills them with a sense of belonging.
The red oak is no different. As students rally around this tree, the University lists off the reasons why it must go, why in fact cutting it down will serve everybody better in the long run: more new trees, more multi-faith spaces, the general safety of passersby.
Ultimately, I wonder if they’ve really heard these students at all. Students don’t love the tree for its added value; they don’t really love it for anything at all. Students love the tree just for the sake of loving. And that should be enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: I spent the summer in a small museum archive in El Salvador reading page after page about Salvadoran refugees fleeing U.S.-funded death squads, the persecution of union workers and teachers, and the conditions that led thousands of Salvadorans to flee for the United States in the 1980s. Writing a thesis on Salvadoran immigration, I knew the histories in those archives were critical. But I didn’t spend long, stomach-churning hours reading horror stories exclusively because it was an intellectual pursuit. Both my parents are immigrants from El Salvador and my motivation came from an intimate place.

Zoe: Broken. That’s how I’d describe the U.S. immigration system. A brokenness that labeled my friends as trespassers on land that wasn’t even rightfully American. A system that blamed immigrants for fleeing problems that were completely “Made in the USA.” Problems born from a legacy of U.S. intervention that supported coups, trained military dictators, and always made sure sovereignty was out of the reach of black and brown hands. I wanted the world to recognize that immigrants had existed before Donald Trump got elected — they had always existed.

R: I’d witnessed how immigration shaped my parents’ lives. Mami would have to buy expensive international call cards to speak, for just a few minutes, with her mother. When a relative died in El Salvador, my parents made last minute travel plans. When it came time to decide on a thesis topic, I chose to explore the relationship between immigration and cultural exclusion, an academically rigorous topic but also a phenomenon I’d seen all around me my whole life.

Z: When I told people my thesis was about immigrants from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, they’d look at me and say, “Wow, that’s really timely.” As if immigration hadn’t existed before 2017 and wouldn’t exist after 2020. The President called it a crisis and progressives had found their new cause. I mean, how could it not be? The man in office was just so horrible, right? He was the first president to vilify immigrants from the Oval Office and blame them for all the wrong in the world, right?

R: Immigration is an increasingly hot topic of conversation and of academic study. But migration is as old as mankind and people’s critiques of immigration control have been consistent. Though many turned a blind eye to it, activists constantly criticized then-President Barack Obama for deporting more people than any president before him. The academics I cite have been studying Salvadoran immigration for decades — showing the pernicious, harmful effects of our immigration system. Well-meaning, self-identified progressives decry the Trump’s treatment of children in detention centers, and I can’t help but wonder if they noticed the photographs of kids in cages, laying on mats, covered in shiny emergency blankets back in 2014.

Z: There are memories I can’t forget. Memories of begging Harvard institutions to fund events for undocumented students on campus in the pre-Trump world. Memories of rejection, when they told me that we just weren’t “inclusive” enough. They’d act like my friends had to sell their stories, just to get support the university should’ve been providing. As if their identities were so easy to reveal when Obama, the “Deporter-in-Chief,” was in office. In the same breath, those Harvard students and the institutions they represented claimed progressive politics and rejected giving us the only help we could have hoped for. It wasn’t fair.

R: If the current buzz has finally motivated folks to genuinely start talking about immigration, that’s great. But they’ll have to acknowledge that immigration is complex. Approaching it, whether in academic spaces or day-to-day conversations, requires hours of sustained reflection. Those of us whose lives have been shaped by immigration have — out of necessity — spent hours reflecting on our present and imagining alternatives to our current immigration system. Individuals with the luxury of ignoring the effect of U.S. immigration policies run the risk of treating immigration as an abstract issue, putting themselves at such a distance that they forget the very real implications of their stances. It’s simple to claim to care about immigration or develop an ideological stance on the topic when it’s nothing but a timely, flashy thought-experience. A real, long-standing commitment to the cause is much, much harder.

Z: I grew up with my grandparents passing down pieces of a México I had visited three times. Their world painted in a Spanish, that many Americans, simply wouldn’t understand. Americans who’d wonder, “How could those people still not speak English, even after forty years?” When I see the range of videos illustrating rampant xenophobia in this country, I think of my grandparents, my mother. They all sacrificed so much for me to be born here, to have a “better life.” For me, forgetting their story of migration, forgetting its significance, is akin to erasing my family tree.

Yet, I worry. I worry about the day when progressives protected by their citizenship, will close their eyes and look back at Trump as one small blip in an otherwise perfect world. Having woken up from the political nightmare, they’ll sigh in relief. Then, they’ll move onto the next “hot” issue, learning all the lingo, and readying to be the heroes in a new story. They’ll leave 10.7 million lives in limbo and remember that time when they used to be really into immigration in college, when they used to care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Office of Technology Development employee Melissa Defay filed a lawsuit against Harvard Wednesday alleging the University racially discriminated against her, failed to accommodate her disability, and retaliated against her when she raised these concerns.
The 16-page complaint — filed in Massachusetts Superior Court — alleges that Harvard Senior Associate Provost and Chief Technology Officer Isaac T. Kohlberg and OTD Director of Financial Operations Marie Letelier directed discriminatory statements and actions toward her. Defay, who wrote in the complaint that she is an African-American woman, described the discrimination as including “race-based comments, a discriminatory and illegal race-based failure to promote [her], and discriminatory actions based upon [her] disability.”
Defay is requesting compensation for damages, legal fees, and other awards that the court “deems just and proper.”
Defay began working at Harvard in 2003 as a financial assistant for Harvard University Dining Services. She then joined OTD in 2005 as a financial coordinator and assumed the role of Senior Financial Administrator in 2016, according to the complaint. Kohlberg also appointed Defay to work as Director of Financial Operations on an interim basis on several occasions, the complaint states.
The complaint also notes that Defay suffers from nummular headache syndrome, a neurological disorder similar to migraines, and that her son has been diagnosed with a form of autism. During her time working at Harvard, her employers were allegedly aware of this disorder and for nearly 10 years had granted her accommodations, including flex time to attend medical appointments and permission to work remotely on Mondays.
Defay applied to the permanent position of Director of Financial Operations in September 2016, according to the complaint. At the time, Kohlberg asked her to assume the director position on an interim basis in addition to her role as a financial administrator, along with another employee in the department.
In the complaint, Defay lists several instances in which Kohlberg allegedly did not treat her equally to other candidates vying for the position. Shortly after Letelier was hired as the new director, Defay also charges that she was not accommodated for her disability.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment on the suit in an email Saturday.
“I can’t comment on any ongoing litigation, however, I can assure you that Harvard is deeply committed to fostering and maintaining an inclusive, diverse, and safe work environment for all,” O’Rourke wrote.
Kohlberg and Letelier referred to the University’s statement when asked for comment.
Shortly after being appointed interim director, Defay brought concerns to Kohlberg that she would be working two full-time jobs without sufficient compensation, according to the suit. Kohlberg allegedly responded by saying that Defay was “focused on minutiae” and that she should be “grateful someone like her” was given the position.
Kohlberg also allegedly told Defay that she “would not be meeting with any other OTD directors in the interim position,” a move that Defay saw as racially motivated. The complaint also states that Kohlberg made racist statements when he “engaged in a loud conversation” with a former colleague near Defay's desk, saying he was an “elitist” and does not believe in “social equality.”
The lawsuit also points to instances in which Defay alleges she was excluded from the hiring process for the director position. The suit states that Defay had not been contacted by the hiring committee for an interview when they began interviewing candidates in October 2016. Defay was informed at that time that Kohlberg had said he was concerned about Defay’s “physical presence” serving as an impediment during meetings with university officials and high-level executives.
Several weeks later, a human resources department recruiter interviewed Defay over the phone, unlike other candidates, who initially met with the hiring committee, according to the complaint. Defay eventually conducted two interviews with two members of the committee. Other candidates, however, met with all eight committee members, according to the suit.
Kohlberg informed Defay that she had not been chosen as the new director on Nov. 23, 2016. According to the complaint, Kohlberg told Defay that Marie Letelier — the new director — had “superior credentials,” but Defay later learned Letelier only had a bachelor’s degree even though a master’s degree was required for the position. Defay was one semester short of receiving her master’s degree at the time.
Defay also states that Kohlberg ordered her to train Letelier. Defay found Letelier to be “incompetent” as she allegedly was unable to perform multiple essential tasks to the job such as performing “royalty distributions” and working with “complex spreadsheets.” Defay states in the complaint that Harvard’s decision to hire Letelier, who she described as a white woman, over herself constituted racism.
Letelier allegedly began questioning Defay's disability accommodation in December 2016 and told Defay that she could “get another job.” Letelier then required Defay and another African-American employee, Leota Smith, to attend a meeting where Letelier explained a new department-wide assessment into flex time. Defay and Smith were the only African Americans in the finance department and the only two employees invited to the meeting, according to the complaint.
In a March 2017 meeting, Letelier allegedly accused Defay of failing to inform employees in OTD that she used a flexible schedule, despite having used this modified schedule for many years. Letelier further stated that she “was not going to accommodate Ms. Defay” and if she wished, Defay could appeal for these accommodations, according to the complaint.
Defay then took a three-month leave from OTD as her health declined. During her leave, Defay’s colleagues were allowed to keep their flex schedules and Defay’s personal belongings were either rearranged or thrown away, according to the complaint. Defay later returned to work but alleged Letelier grew even more hostile toward her, leaving Defay out of staff emails and closely monitoring her lunch breaks.
The “most egregious” part of Letelier’s hostility was continuing to deny Defay of her flex schedule, a move that forced Defay to resign, the complaint states.
Defay alleges that she suffered “severe emotional distress and an exacerbation of her neurological condition.” Furthermore, the complaint states she continues to suffer due to the actions of Kohlberg, Letelier, and other Harvard employees.
John F. Tocci — an attorney for Defay — wrote in an email Friday that the complaint is “fairly extensive and clear." Tocci also said that in the state of Massachusetts, “a discrimination complaint must file a charge of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission before proceeding to court,” which suggests that his team filed a charge with either commission.
“While Ms. Defay separated from Harvard in June of 2017, her damages persist and she looks forward to challenging Harvard’s illegal acts in this litigation - for herself and other Harvard employees who have faced institutional discrimination outside of the limelight of academia,” Tocci wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than 20 years in business, the Starbucks in Harvard's Square's Garage is set to close Friday at 9:30 p.m., the most recent in a string of closings sweeping through the Square.
The upcoming Garage closure marks the second Starbucks location to leave the Square in recent months. Another store in the Seattle-based franchise, previously located on Church Street, shuttered its doors in late 2018.
In a letter addressed to customers, Starbucks district manager Bridget Cortese and store manager Jennifer Mau thanked the store’s clientele for their business.
“We would like to thank you for being part of our store community; you are the heart of who we are at Starbucks. It has been a great pleasure to connect with you every day since 1996,” Cortese and Mau wrote.
With the departures of both the Garage and Church Street coffeehouses, the chain's Harvard Yard location near the Harvard Square Kiosk is the last Starbucks outpost near the river.
For some Harvard College students, the Starbucks in the Garage doubled as a “social space.”
“This is a central hub for all the students who live along the river and even for the people who come from the Quad,” Yuki M. Zbytovsky ’20 said. “A lot of the time we run into a lot of our classmates, so this is also a good social space for us. I’m really, really bummed.”
Lauren A. Sierra ’19, a former Crimson editor, said the slew of closings in Harvard Square have caused her “heartbreak.” Sierra called the Garage Starbucks her “safe haven.”
“When they come for my Starbucks, they come for me on a personal level,” she said.
Clea F. Schumer ’20 said the Garage Starbucks was a good location to avoid crowds of tourists.
“That other Starbucks is the one where all the tourists are,” Schumer said, referring to the Harvard Yard location. “If I wanted to get a quick drink, this has always been the spot for that. Plus, it has the nicest study vibes of all the coffee shops.”
If students are still looking for Starbucks lattes to satisfy their caffeine cravings, they can chose from the Harvard Yard location along Massachusetts Ave. or venture outside the Square to the franchise’s Shepard Post or Broadway Marketplace locations.

​​​​​​
In an email to residents Friday, Adams House administrators announced the formation of a committee to review restroom signage following incidents of vandalism of a gender-neutral bathroom earlier this month.
The email — signed by Adams House Faculty Deans John "Sean" G. Palfrey ’67 and Judith "Judy" S. Palfrey ’67, Resident Dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal, and House Committee members Caroline S. Kristof ’20 and Victoria “Tori” S. Tong ’20 — condemned the “distressing” vandalism and distributed an anonymous survey to Adams residents intended to gather feedback about the incident.
“Following the very distressing events last week when the gender neutral sign on the downstairs bathroom was defaced, we convened a committee of students and tutors to discuss the configuration of and signage for our restrooms,” the group wrote. “The committee is charged with determining the ways that we can promote the values that Adams House cares about the most—both in our facilities and in our communication with one another.”
The move comes after the sign marking the gender-neutral bathroom in Russell Hall was vandalized twice within the past month. The sign — which included three icons intended to represent male, female, and non-binary individuals — had its female icon colored in with black marker. The icons have since been removed, leaving a sign that simply reads, “Restroom.”
The vandalism sparked accusations of transphobia and misogyny against the perpetrator after an Adams House resident sent an image of the sign over the House’s email list, “the Schmooze.” Some students said the vandalism made them feel unsafe, while others debated the vandal’s intent.
The committee’s email praised students’ discussions about the incident, calling it a foundation for their work.
“We appreciate how thoughtful many of you have already been in discussing this topic: over meals in the dining hall, on the Schmooze, and in one-on-one conversations with your peers, tutors, and deans,” they wrote. “These are important conversations that should be had, and we look forward to translating this dialogue into clear next steps.”
In addition to gathering survey results, the committee also plans to partner with the Office of BGLTQ Student Life to offer resources for students, according to the email.
Judy Palfrey wrote in an email to The Crimson that the committee will help Adams administrators respond to the vandalism in a way that is consistent with the house’s values.
“The defacing of our gender neutral signage was an act of desecration and of disrespect that is not acceptable,” she wrote. “We called the committee together to suggest ways that we can underscore our message of inclusivity through the signage, facilities, decorations, and activities the house promotes.”
Palfrey added that the committee plans to regularly update students on its work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
United States Representative Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) joined protesters in Harvard Square in condemning President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to build a border wall and other immigration policies during a President’s Day rally Monday afternoon.
The rally, which took place in front of the Harvard Square Kiosk despite freezing temperatures and light snowfall, was part of a national mobilization effort that saw activists turn out for similar President’s Day protests across the country.
Cambridge Area Stronger Together, a local organization dedicated to social justice and activism efforts, hosted the Harvard Square rally. This year’s event marks the group’s third consecutive President’s Day protest in opposition to President Trump and his administration.
Last Friday, President Trump declared a national emergency to bypass Congress and receive funding for a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The announcement came after Congress passed a spending bill that did not fully fund the border wall that Trump requested. Critics denounced Trump’s decision as unconstitutional, arguing that it violates separation of powers and sets a dangerous precedent for future presidential administrations.
At the Cambridge rally, Pressley criticized President Trump’s rhetoric and actions, which she said marginalize immigrant and refugee communities. She argued that the effects of Trump’s policies are not simply limited to those at the border.
“The impact of this hurt has trickled all the way down to the Massachusetts’ 7th, a district that I am proud to represent that is 53 percent people of color, 40 percent foreign born,” Pressley said.

She said the United States is currently facing real emergencies — including the Flint water crisis, Puerto Rico’s ongoing struggle to recover from Hurricane Maria, unaffordable drug prices, voter suppression, and climate change — but not a security threat at the southern border. Pressley said she is a co-sponsor of a recent congressional resolution that would block Trump’s national emergency declaration.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern also spoke to the crowd, urging them to “keep the resistance going” and to speak out against injustices he sees in the current administration. He said he believes Trump’s actions in office are “bent on hatred and racism and division.”
“When Trump was elected, many of you heard me say that I would not call him ‘President Trump’ until he started behaving like one,” he said. “Well, I’m still waiting.”
​​​​​​
The rally attracted dozens of participants from the Greater Boston area, many of whom carried signs and passed out leaflets.
Karen L. Uminski, a resident of Arlington, Mass., called the prospect of a national emergency on the Mexican border “absurd.”
“Hopefully, with this protest, we can show our representatives in Congress, and also other people who couldn't come out on this snowy day, why this is a problem,” she said.
Organizers led the crowd in several rounds of chants including, “Stand up, speak out, protect our communities” and “No ban, no wall, we welcome all.” The organizers also held up signs with phone numbers for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s offices and encouraged participants to call and leave messages.
Pressley ended her address by vowing to continue her resistance against the Trump administration.
“This is a fake emergency, this is constitutional vandalism, this is an overreach, an over-authority, and an abusive power, and we will do everything to stop it,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
The Undergraduate Council failed to pass two amendments to its caucus system that would have either redefined the purposes of a caucus or eliminated the system entirely at the body's weekly general meeting Monday.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20, Mather House Representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, and Kirkland House Representative Ajay V. Singh ’21 proposed an amendment to "further clarify purpose and definition of caucuses and communities of interest."
Huesa said the original intention of the caucus system — instituted in April 2017 — was to represent the UC’s marginalized communities and ensure attention was paid to the “needs and interests” of those groups.
“We felt that people were starting to abuse this system in terms of what its original purpose was to be on the UC,” Huesa said.
The amendment would have redefined communities of interest as “groups that have been historically underrepresented and marginalized on Harvard’s campus,” more narrowly defining what types of caucuses could exist within the Council. According to Huesa, the amendment would not have allowed certain types of caucuses — such as politically-affiliated ones — to form at all.
“I think that when the legislation was originally created it was understood that this is what we were talking about,” Palaniappan said. “Only in the recent past couple months, we’ve seen the buildup of caucuses that are kind of not surrounding these purposes.”
Dunster House Representative Gevin B. Reynolds ’19 then suggested further changes to the amendment, aiming to allow the UC to dismantle current caucuses that do not conform to the proposed narrowed definition.
The Council accepted that alteration before voting on the overall amendment, which was rejected in a narrow 11-12-5 vote.
Dunster House Representative Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20, a proponent of the amendment, argued that the existence of some causes diminishes the issues faced by marginalized communities. She cited the “problem-solvers” caucus, a group of self-declared creative thinkers who abide by current caucus definitions.
“You don’t want to have the students believe that the UC thinks that being a problem-solver on this campus has the same weight as being African-American,” she said.
Opponents of the amendment argued that the legislation was specifically intended to target the conservative caucus. Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 and UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, a former Crimson Sports Chair, both said members of the executive board antagonized the conservative caucus.
“This legislation is a direct attack against the conservative caucus,” Barclay said. “This is not to compare the experience of a conservative to any other groups at all.”
Eliot House Representative Maxwell A. Gillmer ’21, the newly appointed director of belonging and inclusion for the Council, originally supported the amendment but changed his vote after hearing concerns about the conservative caucus.
“As the director of belonging and inclusion, I want people to feel that they are included, especially within this space, so I don’t want there to be legislation that makes someone feel excluded,” he said.
Following the defeat of the caucus redefinition amendment, Palmer proposed the Caucus Removal Act to entirely remove the caucus system from the Council. Liaising with underrepresented groups, if the act had passed, would instead have fallen under the purview of the director of belonging and inclusion.
In a vocal vote, the UC overwhelmingly rejected the Caucus Removal Act.
Gilmer said he did not think one person could handle the responsibility the caucus system currently supports.
“Do you know how many cultural organizations there are on campus?” Gilmer asked. “There are 77, and a lot for only one person to have direct contact with, so that's why the caucuses are especially important.”
Krishnan-Jha said she felt the notion that the caucus system had no benefits was incorrect.
“I think it holds us accountable for representing the interests of this student population,” she said. “If we get rid of it, there's no accountability. There's no metric by which we can say we're doing something for these communities of interest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 19, 2019 at 12:33 a.m. 
Government students discussed department culture, course offerings, and responses to allegations of sexual misconduct against Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez at consecutive town halls Friday.
The town halls follow the release of a department-wide climate survey that found roughly a third of female graduate students in the department feel their work or study is limited by their gender and 26 percent experienced discrimination. Students discussed possible solutions to issues highlighted in the survey, and faculty members detailed ongoing initiatives, including the recent effort to hire two female professors.
The Government Committee for Climate Change, tasked with investigating department culture in the wake of multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against Dominguez spanning nearly 40 years, organized the survey and town hall.
The University opened a Title IX investigation into Dominguez in April 2018, which is ongoing.
Since the allegations first surfaced, some government students have said they are frustrated with what they perceive as an inadequate response from the University. In March and again in October, graduate students sent letters — the second of which was signed by nearly three-quarters of graduate students in the department — demanding an independent, external review of the Dominguez allegations.
Government Ph.D. candidate Reva Dhingra wrote in an email that though the town hall signaled the department appears to be taking students’ concerns “seriously,” a thorough reckoning with the department’s problems would not come without an independent review.
“The main takeaway from the Domínguez case last year was that, for nearly 40 years, the Government department and Harvard administration failed to protect its students, staff, and faculty from sexual harassment by a faculty member,” she wrote. “Addressing this decades-long failure requires a clear, thorough, and impartial diagnosis of the problems.”
In progress report released alongside the survey results earlier this month, committee members wrote that they drafted a memo calling on administrators to sponsor an external review of “Harvard’s collective failure to respond to problems of alleged sexual harassment.”
They wrote that administrators responded positively to the memo but will not take “public steps” towards an external review until the University completes its investigation of Dominguez.
But with department faculty and students in the dark about the progress of the investigation, some students say they are growing impatient.
“They have tied this review to the completion of the Title IX investigation into Dominguez, a process which is highly opaque with an unclear timeline,” Dhingra wrote. “Nearly a year after the Domínguez story broke, there has therefore been no concrete progress on understanding and preventing sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination in the department.”
Government Ph.D. candidate Manuel A. Meléndez-Sánchez ’15-'16 wrote in an email that graduate students’ efforts have been and will continue to be “critical” in order to effect change in the department.
“A handful of faculty—including Professors Cammett, Enos, Hochschild, and Levitsky—have been largely proactive in addressing the concerns of students,” Meléndez-Sánchez wrote. “Their efforts have been laudable, but the main impetus for change has come from dozens of graduate and undergraduate students who have worked tirelessly over the past year.”
Undergraduates at the town hall also took issue with the department’s lack of identity-centered course offerings.
Government department chair Jennifer L. Hochschild said she decided to again teach a course focusing on race, ethnicity, and immigration after hearing students’ concerns.
Hochschild acknowledged that more long-term solutions, such as increasing the diversity of the department’s faculty, would take years, if not decades. She said the department recently offered jobs to two early-career female political scientists — though one has declined the offer and the other has not yet accepted — and that their gender was “part of the consideration” in the decision.
“There’s a need for more faculty in the arena of gender, in the arena of sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, immigration, class, first-generation,” she said. “I totally, completely agree with that.”
Undergraduates at Friday’s town hall also called for more cross-listed courses — classes jointly offered by more than one department — to allow students to engage with identity-related topics that would ordinarily require forgoing concentration credit to pursue.
“If you’re a gov concentrator and you want to study issues of identity, issues that speak to you, and there’s not that offering in the gov department, you’re conflicted between fulfilling requirements and taking a course that speaks to you,” said Sarah S. Fellman ’18-’19, a member of the Committee for Climate Change.
Hochschild added that many of the suggestions that students offered at Friday’s event “weren’t new,” indicating that steps the department has taken so far — including those implemented by the subcommittees to the Climate Change Committee itself — were not sufficient.
“That’s an indication that we haven’t really done our work yet efficiently and effectively,” she said.
Correction: Feb. 20, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the investigation into Dominguez. In fact, The Crimson reached out to the wrong spokesperson. 
Correction: Feb. 19, 2019
A previous version of this article misspelled Meléndez-Sánchez's name and incorrectly stated his graduating year was '15. In fact, he was off-cycle and his graduating year was '15-'16.

​​​​​​
Harvard College announced the creation of a new working group charged with examining how spaces and symbols on campus impact the student body and exploring new avenues for diversity-related programming Tuesday morning.
Ali S. A. Asani ’77, a professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic religion and cultures, will chair the group, called the Working Group on Symbols and Spaces of Engagement. He will work with undergraduates alongside other faculty and staff to “examine how our campus spaces, symbols, and programming advance an inclusive learning environment,” according to its mission.
In an emailed statement, Asani highlighted the educational goals of the working group, saying he hopes to increase students’ engagement with issues of diversity.
“What I am hoping for the College to develop is an ethos where students come to respect and celebrate one another precisely for their differences,” Asani wrote. “In this regard, the process is not about papering over differences, but to use these differences as opportunities for education.”
Asani also pointed to developments at the College since he first came to Harvard as a freshman in 1973. He said the changes of the past several decades are evidence of progress on issues of diversity at Harvard.
“I have witnessed the gradual dismantling of these structures of segregation. The randomization of undergraduate housing has really improved the situation, as there is much more mixing of the student population,” he said. “The intake of students is also far more diverse than ever it used to be.”
The creation of the group comes in response to a report issued by the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging in March 2018. The report — centered on eight goals — encouraged administrators to consider two faculty-designed centers, one focused on “identity, politics, and culture” and the other on “higher education, inclusion and belonging, and organizational change.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the group will work to identify and fill gaps in the College’s diversity-related programming.
“I think one of the things that's really important to understand is what it is that people feel is missing and how can we best deliver on that,” Khurana said in an interview.
In response to feedback gathered from Harvard affiliates last year, the report also encouraged schools across the University to consider how implicit “social norms” affect people of color of campus.
“[They] said that encounters with tacit social norms are often experienced as privileging particular identities — typically white, male, secular, and politically liberal,” the report read.
At the time, some undergraduates criticized a draft version of the report because it stopped short of endorsing an Ethnic Studies program or a multicultural center — two longtime asks made by student activists. As recently as this month, students sent letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling for a dedicated program in Ethnic Studies and demonstrated outside an alumni event where he spoke.
It is unclear whether the new working group will explore the possibility of establishing a multicultural center or an Ethnic Studies program on campus. When asked about the prospect of the group getting involved in plans for a multicultural center, Khurana emphasized the importance of analyzing what students’ needs for on-campus spaces are.
“Without that analysis of what we hope for our spaces, what people feel is missing, we can end up creating spaces or re-allocating spaces in ways that doesn't necessarily achieve the hoped-for goal,” Khurana said.
The group’s work will culminate in an “guiding document” aiming to evaluate Harvard’s history with diversity and opportunities for programs and spaces to address student concerns.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roderick “Rod” L. MacFarquhar, a professor of history and political science renowned for his close study of Chinese communism, died of heart failure on Feb. 10 at the age of 88.
A professor at Harvard since 1984, MacFarquhar was one of the leading scholars on the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong’s decade-long attempt to violently purge China of lingering anti-communist forces from 1966 to 1976.
MacFarquhar served as director of the Fairbank Center for China Studies from 1986-1992 and 2005-2006, during which time he was celebrated as a great fundraiser for the center and a supporter of its library, which he helped transform into a leading resource for China Studies scholars around the world. Between his directorships, from 1998-2004, he chaired Harvard’s Government Department.
Michael A. Szonyi, a history professor and director of the Fairbank Center, said MacFarquhar’s study of the Cultural Revolution was of “enormous importance” because “only limited research could be done [on the subject] from within China.”
MacFarquhar’s path into academia was untraditional: he received a master’s degree from Harvard’s Far Eastern Regional Studies Department in 1955, founded the China Quarterly — a leading scholarly journal in the field — in Britain in 1960, worked as a journalist, and then entered British politics, where he served as a member of Parliament for five years during the 1970s.
Both experiences informed his scholarship. Working from the materials available to him — documents, interviews, and other classified accounts — MacFarquhar wrote his seminal three-volume book, “The Origins of the Cultural Revolution” (1974, 1983 and 1997), which Szonyi called “the most masterful analysis we have of the Cultural Revolution.”
“He approached the study of politics not as a theoretician, but as a former journalist and as a former practitioner of politics,” his son, Rory A. MacFarquhar said.
This sensitivity to China’s political atmosphere shaped MacFarquhar’s work in other ways as well. According to Szonyi, MacFarquhar helped Chinese scholars continue their studies at Harvard after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
“Rod said it was incumbent on the community of China scholars to provide support for intellectuals, for students, and professors, who were being persecuted. He made a home for many of them at Harvard,” Szonyi said.
One such figure was Wang Dan, a protest leader who spent seven years in prison in China during 1990s. After Wang was medically paroled, MacFarquhar helped facilitate his acceptance into the History Department as a one-year special student. With MacFarquhar’s support, Wang continued to study at Harvard, ultimately earning a master’s degree and a Ph.D.
“After knowing Professor MacFarquhar for now more than two decades, I have come to very much appreciate his determined adherence to basic human values and his steadfast opposition to despotism,” Wang wrote in an email. “He was a true public intellectual role model.”
MacFarquhar left a legacy in the classroom as well, where his undergraduate course on the Cultural Revolution attracted as many as 600 to 700 students per semester.
“Rod, very famously, would go up to the lectern and lecture for an hour without any notes, just holding the class spellbound,” said Steven M. Goldstein, a professor emeritus of government at Smith College and a long-time friend of MacFarquhar. “He was trying to get people to understand the Cultural Revolution, but also understand how a society can go mad.”
According to Michael G. Forsythe, a former teaching fellow for the course, MacFarquhar would accomplish that goal by dressing his teaching fellows as Red Guards and having them carry copies of the “Little Red Book,” a collection of writings by Mao that was widely distributed during the Cultural Revolution. He would have the class on its feet, shouting phrases like “10,000 years for Mao!” in Chinese.
“It gave the students taking the course a real visceral feeling for the fervor of being in China, in the Cultural Revolution, and being in a rally,” Forsythe said. Forsythe, whose master’s thesis MacFarquhar advised, went on to be a New York Times correspondent in Hong Kong.
These immersive educational methods were characteristic of MacFarquhar’s style, according to Szonyi.
“He was a model for how to be a scholar, how to deal with the challenges of working on a society which is very different, which you respect, but which you also have some fundamental disagreements with,” Szonyi said. He did so “with honesty, with courtesy, and with tremendous wit. He was always able to find humor in something.”
Goldstein also recalls MacFarquhar’s good-humor. The two professors would frequent the sparsely-populated movie theater at Fresh Pond Mall together and entertain themselves by watching “bad science fiction films.”
“The thing about Rod is that he was totally unpretentious,” Goldstein added. “There was nobody who was too unimportant that he wouldn’t take time to see.”
Forsythe echoed those sentiments. “He was so charming, so thoughtful and considerate,” he said. At dinners, MacFarquhar would often raise a glass to his students and colleagues and give them “the most eloquent, heartfelt toasts.”
“Those small gestures,” Forsythe said, “are the things that stick with you for the rest of your life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning to Lavietes Pavilion after a five game road stretch, Harvard (12-9, 5-3 Ivy) started its weekend home split with a disappointing loss to Princeton (13-9, 5-2 Ivy) that allowed the Tigers to overtake the Crimson in the conference standings. Harvard bounced back in thrilling fashion by upsetting Penn (16-4, 6-1 Ivy) in double overtime the following night.
HARVARD 80, PENN 72
In front of sold-out home crowd, the Crimson played some of its best basketball this season to hand the Quakers their first conference loss of the season.
The Quakers came into this matchup with a suffocating defensive game plan that had only allowed 50 points per game. For Harvard to come away with a victory, it was critical for them to match Penn’s stalwart defense and excel at one of their greatest strengths: rebounding.
“Our mentality was more about what we were going to do on the defensive end and rebounding,” sophomore forward Jadyn Bush said. “Tonight was a team effort on the boards, boxing out, and letting our guards get those boards. Punching first on the defensive end, really paid off tonight.”
The game was a methodical defensive battle at the start, with the Quakers holding the Crimson to only four points in the first six minutes. The tempo was slow and both teams were aggressive on the boards.
The momentum quickly began to favor Harvard when it rained in a barrage of triples late in the quarter. Threes from junior guards Mackenzie Barta and Katie Benzan, along with a late triple from co-captain guard Madeline Raster allowed Harvard to build a 16-12 lead through the opening period of play.
Katie Benzan set the tone for the Crimson in the second quarter, ending a Harvard scoring drought in the second period with a pull-up triple. The Crimson proceeded to score three unanswered baskets to take a 26-22 lead.
Harvard continued its aggressive attack against the vaunted Penn defense. Senior guard Sydney Skinner hit a late triple and Jadyn Bush scored four consecutive points, including a basket that came off a no-look pass from Katie Benzan. This late run had the Crimson up 33-29 at the half.
Harvard extended its lead to double digits at the start of the third quarter going up 41-31. The Quakers went on a run late in the period to cut the deficit to one heading into the final frame.
In the final quarter, Penn retook the lead and heightened its defensive play, allowing only four points through the first nine minutes. With 25 seconds left to play, Jadyn Bush drew a foul and knocked down two clutch free throws to tie the game.
“Free throws have been a big emphasis in practice,” Bush said. “I think that hammering in those drills I could shoot those free throws like I do every day in practice.”
In the overtime period, Coach Delaney-Smith made the requisite offensive adjustments to tire Penn’s defense.
“We changed offenses a lot; we were trying to find what the holes were,”Delaney-Smith said. “We were trying to do some screening on the zone, and Penn was more tired than we were.”
After a tightly contested first overtime, the Crimson pulled away in the second overtime period to come away with a 80-72 victory.
PRINCETON 75, HARVARD 71
In a down-to-the-wire matchup, Princeton defeated Harvard because of extended runs in the second and third quarter that became too much for the Crimson to answer.
Harvard started the game with strong offensive play and matched any scoring run the Tigers went on. Co-captain guard Madeline Raster was the key to the Crimson’s early scoring success. The Indiana native led Harvard in both scoring and assists this game, having four of her team-high six assists in the first period.
Princeton would take back the momentum in the second quarter, starting the period on an 11-2 run that would give them a four point lead. The Tiger’s bench play was integral to their offensive rhythm in this quarter.
“Some of their bench players hurt us which was an unfortunate turning point,” Delaney-Smith said. “They did some things which we shouldn’t have left them do.”
Princeton held the Crimson to only 12 points in the second quarter, and went into the half with a 38-33 lead. They continued to play aggressive offensively and stifle the Harvard scoring attack to start the half. The Tiger’s dominant play at the outset of the third quarter incited a 12-2 run that gave them a 15 point lead midway through the period.
“They were switching off screens and getting in the passing lanes,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were playing sloppy. We can’t have 19 turnovers and beat the best teams in our league”
Harvard started cutting down the Princeton lead late in the third quarter because of strong ball movement and minimal turnovers. The team headed into the final frame with a single-digit deficit.
The fourth quarter was a back-and-forth affair that saw Princeton maintain their lead for the entirety of the period. The Crimson had a chance to comeback down five with just under a minute left.
Madeline Raster hit back-to-back threes to get the Crimson within two, but missed the potential game-tying shot during the closing seconds of the game. Two late free throws sealed the game, and Harvard’s comeback attempt fell short.
“I was proud of our comeback,” Delaney-Smith said.“I think we move forward and ix things we need to work on. It’s always a work in progress.”

Well folks, winter has been brutal but the groundhog has officially decided that spring is coming soon. So, of course now is the perfect time for all of us to get out of our winter hibernation and start getting those beach bods ready for summer. The freshman (or sophomore/junior/senior) 15 can be hard to beat, especially when the New England cold makes running outside seem masochistic. Don’t worry, though. We’ve got some tips for you to actually start getting into the healthy habits you’ve been telling your family about since the beginning of the year.
Try A Balanced Meal
Remember the five food groups you learned about in elementary school? Surprise, they still exist! Even small changes to mix up your diet with foods from each of these groups can make a big impact (especially if you exclusively eat grilled cheese sandwiches every day). Additionally, by branching out you may even find a new random Harvard University Dining Services dish that you love along the way.
Grab Some Friends
The worst thing about trying to start some new ~healthy habits~ is actually sticking with them, so enlist your squad to hold you accountable! Even better, send them this article to guilt them into actually trying some of these tips with you. After all, trying healthy habits is so much easier when your lunch buddy doesn’t have 14 cookies on his/her plate at every meal.
Actually Get Sleep
Most of us already know that sleep is important for helping our performance on all those p-sets, tests, and papers we’re working on, but did you know it can also help you get fit? Sleep plays a big role in keeping the hormones that affect hunger and metabolism balanced (a.k.a. making you more likely to want the most unhealthy midnight snack you can find when you pull an all-nighter). It’s easier said than done, but really try to clock in those eight hours every night – your body, mind, and pset buddies will thank you.
Pray to Get Quadded
Freshmen may see this as a hot take with Housing Day coming up quickly, but why not have your workout routine built into your everyday life? Skip out on the river run and pray to the Quad Gods that you get placed far enough from classes where you can knock out your workout for the week just by running to class. Plus, running to J.P. Licks to get ice cream balances out, right?
So maybe the days of hitting the books (or Cabot Aquarium) instead of the gym are starting to add up, but second semester is the perfect time to turn your life around. If worst comes to worst, you can always get fit by running away from your problems!
