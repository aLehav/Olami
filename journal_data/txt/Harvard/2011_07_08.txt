After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MOSHI, Tanzania—Over the course of the week I have noticed that my eyebrows are reaching for the middle of my forehead like long-lost siblings, straining to reunite and make me look like the lovechild of Frida and Groucho. They have no respect for the fact that I am in a country where women are more likely to shave their eyebrows and pencil them in for the rest of their lives than to shape them into the thin, pointy arches that I’m told improve bone structure. I had this problem the first time I came to Tanzania, three years ago, and it resulted in a memory card of unusable photos. But the situation has since improved: Last year, in Dar es Salaam, I found Zainab.
I had seen many South Asian women in Dar, most of whom had perfectly nice eyebrows. And, being Indian, I know this was not natural. One afternoon, I got in a taxi and asked the driver to take me to a salon frequented by Indian or Arab women. This isn’t a strange request in Tanzania, where most small businesses have neither public phone number, nor address, nor name. They’re just that stationary store near that nursery school whose owner has a kid named Abdullah.
The driver and I stopped at the nearest Indian grocery store, where he asked a woman in a full veil to give me the name of a place. Suddenly animated, she wrote down a number for me, “Zainab, she is a good woman, she will give you a good price!” She continued, “We are one.” If you are ever in Dar es Salaam and need to get your eyebrows threaded: Zainab has that salon across from Muhimbili Hospital, but not the entrance near the taxi stand.
In much the same way, I found Jyoti in Moshi. This time it was my waitress at Deli Chez, who took me to a four-room house behind a dry cleaner. Jyoti threads eyebrows, does facials, dyes gray hair with henna, and sells imported sandals and salwars in her living room. (Or is it a dining room? It has a fridge. Or a bedroom? It has a bed.) I can hear her kids watching Indian soap operas while I get my eyebrows done.
Jyoti’s daughter, Aisha, is around my age. Her skin is a pale yellow color, lacking the glossy finish gifted by the Tanzanian sun. Her English is melodic and uneven, unlike the rapid-fire patter of my African Tanzanian friends. I ask her when she moved to Tanzania from India and she laughs: her family has been here for over forty years. Forty years! And yet, I could mistake Aisha for a classmate of my cousin in Delhi. I wonder how her skin and accent have been protected—if she said, “ah-loh?” instead of “heh-loh” when answering the phone, did her mother correct her?
I’ve always wanted to fit in here, so I find it difficult to understand a determination to retain the differences that set people like Aisha apart. But efforts at cultural preservation do mean that in every city I know I can find a Zainab or a Jyoti—a kind, middle-aged woman who can help me look, and thus feel, like myself in a very foreign place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NAIROBI, Kenya—On my second day our search was successful—we found free wifi. My roommate, Sree, and I sat on a couch at Cake Plaza, a pastry shop with a verdant courtyard where we could fortuitously connect to the wireless network. Happily undisturbed and satisfied with the artistic cake display, we had just settled behind our screens when a voice exclaimed, “It’s you again! And you’ve brought a friend!”
Sree gave me a look of panic. The speaker, a 20-something employee with a mop in hand, approached us and unnecessarily mopped the floor around our ankles. “You look very nice today,” he complimented Sree. “I like you in this room.”
Citing work as an excuse, Sree dismissed him. Once he had left, she confided that the previous week he had expressed to her his undying love—or something of the sort.
His pickup line was a twist on a classic: “I don’t have a cell phone,” he had said. “But when I do, can I have your number?”
He hadn’t waited for a response. Instead, he offered his own cheerful reply: “When I have a cell phone, you will give me your number.” He grinned.
The undying optimism, unsolicited cordiality, and uninhibited confidence displayed by our mop-wielding friend (that he would get a cell phone, and that Sree would give him her number) were strangely impressive and unduly inspiring. It was this charm offensive that welcomed me to Kenya, showing me an attitude that I hadn’t often experienced back home.
We haven’t returned to Cake Plaza since our encounter. But when we do, I expect to see the man with the mop. Maybe my first impressions were wrong; perhaps he’ll be less friendly than before. Perhaps he’ll call us out for using the Internet for hours together without supporting the café in equal measure. Or maybe he’ll have a cell phone and a slightly modified pickup line.
Hey, he’ll say. Can I have your number?

VENICE, Italy—Maybe you haven’t heard of la Biennale di Venezia—until this summer, I hadn’t. But when the biannual modern art exhibition opened at the beginning of June, mega-yachts filled the Giudecca Canal near our dorms. When we asked why the Jewish Ghetto was crawling with security, we learned that the Israeli President was in town for the opening of his country’s exhibit.
The first Biennale was held in 1895, and this June art from seventy-plus countries flooded pavilions all over the city. Thirty permanent pavilions in the Giardini, one of Venice’s few large parks, are each allocated to a particular nation to showcase its art.
I should confess that I’m not much of a modern art person. And I’m certainly no art critic. It’s not that I don’t like it—I just don’t get most of it. Even the graffiti in the bathroom stall at the Giardini (“architecture is dying”) confused me. Yet I appreciated the exhibits in the gardens—their creativity, their insight.
Yes, I did think some of the exhibits were awful. Sweden’s pavilion consisted of a tall tree surrounded by a few paintings of more trees, some rocks, and—to encapsulate my opinion of the exhibit—animal dung. Australia tried too hard: One of its pieces was a canvas painted white, adorned with a small piece of duct tape. In a similar vein, Spain’s minimalist exhibit was accurately named “The Inadequate.”
But most of the Biennale exhibits I saw provoked more awe, or appreciation. An exhibit in the main hall, “Ex-Offenders at the Scene of the Crime,” showcased a photographer’s poignant shots of South African criminals in the locations that they had committed heinous acts. Despite the anguished expressions on the subjects’ faces, the exhibit was uplifting: each picture’s description relayed how the South African had turned his or her life around.
While some exhibits followed the art gallery model, placing discrete works in more conventional spaces, others treated their entire allotted space as art. Great Britain turned its pavilion into a bunker-like maze filled with mysterious dark rooms. Japan followed suit, creating a space that employed curved mirrors to portray a vast city scene in a confined space.
The United States’ pavilion was lackluster except for one clever contraption: an ATM inside of an organ. Each time a debit card was inserted into the machine, the organ belted some new melody.
I’ll admit that I’m still figuring out the meaning of that one. But I’m not trying too hard—architecture is dying, anyway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 19-year-old female was allegedly raped near the Charles River on Monday after meeting with her alleged attacker in Harvard Square.
Joseph L. “Vocals” Brown, 22, was arrested in connection with the alleged rape and was arraigned on Tuesday in Brighton District Court. Bail was set at $50,000.
According to the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office, Brown met with the woman in Harvard Square. A Brighton resident, she knew the defendant because they lived near each other, according to District Attorney spokesperson Jake M. Wark.
Following their meeting, they made an impromptu decision to cross the Weeks Footbridge and watch the July 4 fireworks, Wark said.
While on the Boston side of the footbridge, Brown allegedly pushed her to the ground and raped her, the District Attorney’s office said.
She left the area on foot and called a friend, who called police, according to the District Attorney’s office. She admitted herself to Cambridge Hospital, submitted to a rape kit, and was treated for a small head injury.
When speaking with the Massachusetts State Police, Brown “allegedly acknowledged sexual activity with the young woman but gave multiple conflicting accounts of the incident,” a statement from District Attorney Daniel F. Conley’s office said.
When contacted, his attorney Jason Chan declined to comment on the case.
Brown will return to court for a pretrial conference on July 21.

Michelle Obama, Ted Kennedy, Skip Gates, and Bill Bartley all have one thing in common—they sure didn't break Mr. Bartley's window over the holiday weekend.
But who did?
"Unless you're a liberal wacko, you're a suspect," said Bill E. Bartley, the general manager of Bartley's Gourmet Burgers. He proceeded to list names off the restaurant's celebrity burger menu.
"Check Joe Biden, though," he said, before turning to this correspondent and asking for her alibi. "What were you doing on Sunday?"
"Um ... ?"
Bartley said he certainly has an alibi. He was on vacation when he received a call Sunday morning from Cambridge police that one of the painted glass windows to his storefront had been broken.
According to the Cambridge Police Department, no one seemed to have gained entry into the store. Bartley said new glass was installed on Friday, and he has found a new artist to repaint the window.
He also hypothesized that most likely a drunk individual "put a butt through it." At least that's what he said happened a year and a half ago when the larger storefront window was broken. Compared to the February 2010 broken window, though, this time's damage was higher up (perhaps Yao Ming's butt, Bartley speculated).
But Bartley said his family's restaurant was not new to broken windows. Bartley recalled a phone booth once smashed into the window back when there was one right in front of the restaurant at least five years ago. Every time, they just get the glass replaced, call in an artist for the repainting, and resume business as usual.
And, of course, Bartley will keep drafting that list of suspects.
"I'd really look into Joe Biden," he said.
