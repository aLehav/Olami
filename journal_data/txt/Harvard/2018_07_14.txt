After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked what she was going to do after a little more than a decade of being the president of the nation’s oldest and arguably most renowned university, former University President Drew G. Faust was hazy. Perhaps she’d spend a year at her Cape Cod home, reading. Maybe she’d dip her feet back into her love for history and the literature that lined her steps to the presidency in the first place. Overall, she was going to take deserved (and long overdue) time for herself.
Mere days after she made this statement, however, news broke that Faust had exchanged her Mass. Hall office for a view of Wall Street. She accepted a position on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs—and this transition, from the president of Harvard University to another cog in the corporate machine, is nothing short of disheartening.
To clarify: Neither I nor anyone else has the right to demand that Faust should not have taken the job. Her decisions were and are her own, and her contribution to the University throughout her time here warrant respect. Moreover, working on Wall Street, while occupying a significant part of her time, doesn’t require that her educational passions or her advocacy wither away altogether; she will still teach history at Harvard, which is incredibly important to note. Her move to Goldman Sachs' board of directors does not have to be seen as the ultimate death sentence for her fight for higher education.
But it does comes close. The message that this decision sends has a massive impact on not only the Harvard community but perhaps even the world of higher education.
In retrospect, her transition to a position on Wall Street could have been predicted: Faust showed particular prowess in her ability to keep Harvard financially afloat upon taking the reins as the Great Recession swallowed an estimated $11 billion within a year. Her capital campaign fundraising and conservative financial skills were central to her tenure as University president. These experiences were undoubtedly significant in Goldman Sachs' consideration of her for the job and will ultimately serve her well in her new position.
Faust’s dedication to this institution and to preserving the higher education it offers were the motivating factors for these experiences. More than any other past Harvard president, Faust has been fiercely vocal about academia, especially in regards to lobbying efforts countering the current political mayhem taking over D.C. She has become the understood mouthpiece of higher education, fighting all at once against a GOP endowment tax bill, for funding for scientific research, and for the protection of undocumented immigrants. Even on the homefront, she has vied for more inclusivity by pushing for sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and has fought for increased financial aid programs.
Talented and powerful individuals who have a penchant for putting education first are hard to come by. Given that teachers, the largest body of those directly involved in the education system across the nation, are largely bogged down with the struggles in their own classrooms, it is necessary that louder voices rise to the occasion to call attention to issues that plague the education system.
And in today’s political climate, the list of issues with the educational system is ever-growing. Obama’s “Dear Colleague” letter, which contains guidelines that attempt to minimize the school-to-prison pipeline for minority students, is under attack: Many are calling for its rescission. Though affirmative action is an imperfect system, calls for its reversal and a lawsuit filed against Harvard threaten to set the country’s educational system back decades. Tax bills and a lack of research funding propose to strip the University’s ability to provide for its students. Xenophobic rhetoric, travel bans, and cage-wielding “terrorist organizations” from the White House are turning people away from choosing to contribute to our education.
Harvard—vicariously through Faust—could have given those fighting for these issues a voice to combat governmental steps being taken to weaken higher education and the education system at large. Education in this country is a business, and as an administrator with business knowledge who understands the value of education and the flaws within this system, she could have made a tremendous impact. This could have been the opportunity for an individual of incredible prominence and skills to dedicate much-needed time and resources to these matters. Progress on any of these fronts, even marginally, could have been made with a strong leader at the helm.
Instead, Faust will be devoting a substantial chunk of her time and talents to Goldman Sachs, a company notorious amongst undergraduates for siphoning students, many of whom are of color and/or low-income, into its circles with promises of high starting salaries and professional elitism in lieu of pursuing further education or non-profit work. Though the students drawn to this company because of a genuine interest in the work or to give meaning to their family’s sacrifices with its paystub are not the problem, Faust’s decision to deepen Harvard’s ties with the company only further complicate this idea of pursuing Wall Street as a student despite having deeper interests lying elsewhere.
But maybe Goldman Sachs won’t be Faust’s Mephistopheles. Maybe these issues infesting our education system and higher education will receive the necessary attention that lead to their resolutions. Maybe Faust will even be a professor to the minds that will take on the challenges that education faces in our nation today.
All we can do is wait and see, and hope for the best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has defended its use of affirmative action in its admissions decisions for decades, weathering lawsuits and federal investigations with its “holistic” review policy intact.
But if conservative Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh makes it to the U.S. Supreme Court, that might change. Legal experts say Kavanaugh’s nomination could jeopardize the future of affirmative action policies at high schools and colleges throughout the country—including Harvard.
Kavanaugh’s nomination comes as Harvard is facing legal challenges in lower courts for their race-conscious admissions policies, which opponents say discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, he will replace retiring Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is known for being the Supreme Court’s “swing vote.” In previous Supreme Court cases related to affirmative action, Kennedy joined the liberal wing of the court in upholding race-conscious admissions policies.  Kennedy penned the majority opinion in the 2016 Fisher v. University of Texas case, which held that it is legal for universities to consider the race of applicants.
Theodore M. Shaw, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, called the nomination a “very profound moment” for the status of affirmative action at institutions across the country because of its potential to shift the ideological balance of the Court.
In a statement responding to the Trump adminstration’s reversal of Obama-era guidelines on the use of race in college admissions earlier this month, Harvard spokeswoman Melodie L. Jackson wrote, “Harvard will continue to vigorously defend its right, and that of all colleges and universities, to consider race as one factor among many in college admissions, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court for more than 40 years.”
But with Kavanaugh on the bench, the Court might no longer uphold affirmative action.
“If [Kavanaugh] is what they say he is, then that would be a fifth vote who would moor the court further to the right than Justice Kennedy’s presence on the court did,” Shaw said Friday. “And so, that’s a cause for concern for anybody who is a believer, as many people in institutions of this country are, in the value of diversity and opportunity.”
Kavanaugh is likely to hold a less favorable opinion of affirmative action compared to Kennedy, legal experts say. With a decidedly conservative majority, the Court may impose tighter restrictions on affirmative action, according to Bert W. Rein, an attorney who represented Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who sued UT after she wasn’t admitted, in the Fisher v. University of Texas case.
“If I had to guess, I’d say that a more conservative court would first adhere more strictly to some of the limitations that were written into the Court’s decision in Grutter and Fisher,” Rein said, referring to two landmark affirmative action cases.
Those cases laid out guidelines for when weighing race in admissions decisions is legally permissible. Specifically, the Court said universities may consider race in admissions only when they determine that they have a “compelling interest” in achieving diversity, and when race-neutral alternatives do not result in sufficient diversity.
“You might see a more stringent review of whether any university’s program does or does not adhere and honor those limitations,” Rein said.
Harvard could be the first university to experience such a review. Many expect the ongoing lawsuit against the University, engineered by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, to reach the nation’s highest court.
As a circuit court judge, Kavanaugh has yet to issue opinions in cases explicitly related to affirmative action in schools. However, in 1999, before becoming a judge, Kavanaugh co-authored an amicus brief arguing that it was illegal for the state of Hawaii to consider the race of voters in determining their eligibility for participating in certain elections. The Supreme Court agreed, saying that the state’s Office of Hawaiian Affairs could not limit elections to Native Hawaiians.
Notably, Kavanaugh wrote the brief on behalf of the Center for Educational Opportunity. The CEO is a conservative think tank which describes itself as “devoted to issues of race and ethnicity” and firmly opposes affirmative action.
Roger Clegg, a former Justice Department official who is president of the CEO, said Friday that he believes Harvard’s “problematic” race-conscious admissions policy is “vulnerable” in the context of a Supreme Court opinion regardless of who is confirmed to replace Kennedy. Clegg said he expects Kavanaugh to be “more conservative than Justice Kennedy in general on a variety of issues.”
“I think Harvard’s policy would have been vulnerable even if Merrick Garland had been confirmed to be on the Supreme Court,” Clegg said, referring to former President Barack Obama’s nominee. “With that said, I think that naturally, the more conservative the Court becomes, the more vulnerable Harvard’s policy is.”
When questioned about the brief in his 2004 D.C Circuit Court confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh deferred to precedent.
“The Supreme Court has decided many cases on affirmative action programs and, if confirmed, I would faithfully follow those precedents,” he said. “My personal views or the views of my former clients on these or other issues would not affect how I would approach decisions as an appeals court judge.”
Richard H. Sander ’78, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said it’s “hard to say” how Kavanaugh might come down on issues of affirmative action in higher education.
“Justice Kennedy and Justice O’Connor both had a record of opposing racial preferences in other contexts, and then, modified their positions when they were confronted with university admissions,” Sander said Friday. “I think that for many of the justices, university admissions pose a harder situation than most types of racial preference.”
Certain civil rights groups, however, are concerned Kavanaugh’s legal background poses a threat to affirmative action, and could have a negative effect on other racial issues.
The NAACP wrote in a Tuesday press release, “With a Justice Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, we could see reversals of hard-won gains securing equal opportunity in education, employment and housing.”
The lawsuit against Harvard is scheduled for a trial beginning on Oct. 15. The federal government is also separately investigating Harvard’s admissions practices.
University representatives and Students for Fair Admissions, the group suing Harvard, did not respond to requests for comment.
