After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some kinds of truth are absolute. Two plus two is four, time moves forward, your brother is always your brother. More complex are the subjective truths—love, hatred, fear, and so on. Far more difficult still is the third sort of truths: things that become true the moment that we lend them the weight of our own credence. “The Fishermen,” Nigerian author Chigozie Obioma’s debut novel, is a searing, incandescent exploration of the repercussions that come from acting on such a belief. Using the story of four young brothers as a magnifying lens, Obioma delves into the ways in which belief can build the deepest of bonds, only to eviscerate them in an instant.
Obioma’s story takes place between 1995 and 1996 in the Nigerian city of Akure, where Ikenna, Boja, Obembe, and Benjamin are the four eldest in a family of six children. Benjamin, only nine years old at the beginning of the story, is Obioma’s chosen narrator; his recollection of the story, while keenly perceptive and often poignant, always reads authentically as that of a child, a difficult feat. Ben is party to the deterioration of the once-close relationship between his oldest brothers, Ikenna and Boja, who at 14 and 13, respectively, are separated by only 11 months in age. A catastrophic chain of events begins when the town’s wildly sinister madman, Abulu, prophesies to Ikenna that he will “swim in a river of red but never rise from it again” and that his life will be taken by a fisherman. The brothers call themselves fishermen, as they often sneak down to the dangerous Omi-Ala river to fish; in a striking twist, Ikenna takes the prophecy to mean that Boja will murder him. While this plot choice had the potential to seem extreme, Obioma so wonderfully casts the events that they come to feel natural, even inevitable.
Through Obioma’s rich figurative writing—for example, Ben describes his father’s lectures as leaving “every word tacked nine-inches deep into the beams of our minds”—the reader is able to watch this bitter seed take root in Ikenna’s heart. Obioma writes of Ikenna’s obsession as an uncontrollable wild animal that “had gone berserk and was destroying his mind with the ferocity of madness, pulling down paintings, breaking walls, emptying cupboards, turning tables until all that he knew, all that was him, all that had become him was left in disarray.” His withdrawal into his self-constructed prison is depicted with artful restraint. At first, Ikenna becomes restless, irritable; soon after, he begins to eat alone and avoid his siblings; after that, he lashes out, antagonizing Boja and trapping them both in a spiral of increasingly genuine enmity. That spiral comes to a brutal, shocking conclusion during a particularly violent fight between the two, when Boja fulfills Abulu’s prophecy and fatally stabs Ikenna.
For days after the murder, Boja is nowhere to be found; Ben’s description of these days and their culmination are some of the most emotionally gutting passages of the work. “After four torturous days...he showed himself,” he explains to his listener. “Perhaps Boja saw [his mother’s grief] and pitied her and the rest of us, too. Or, perhaps he was merely forced to reveal himself because he could no longer hide.” These lines seem to lead to a confrontation between the family and Boja—yet no such confrontation occurs. Boja, it is revealed, is dead, having drowned. After killing Ikenna, he threw himself into the family’s well, “one of the deepest in the district”; it took his body four days to float to the surface. Ben’s lack of comprehension of the final and absolute nature of death is a powerful, painful reminder that, despite all he’s seen, he is still only a child. In the deaths of Ikenna and Boja, Obioma reveals the true power of his writing; it takes him no more than 25 emotional, lyrical pages to lay out a family’s tragedy, a component that easily could have been the novel’s entirety.
Obioma continues to dig deeper into this cycle of misplaced belief and destruction. Obembe and Ben, realizing that their brothers’ deaths would not have occurred had Abulu never uttered his prophecy, convince themselves that Ikenna and Boja cannot rest until revenge is won. Their plots to kill Abulu begin as laughably childish fantasies—such as throwing lots of rocks at him—yet grow steadily darker and more lethal, with horrible results. It is a reflection of the three-dimensionality with which Obioma realizes his characters that these propositions, instead of feeling incongruous or exaggerated, come across merely as understandable and deeply sad.
As the bonds between these formerly inseparable brothers disintegrate, Obioma’s message becomes increasingly clear. Looking back on the aftermath of Ikenna and Boja’s death, an older Ben explains, “I have now come to know that what one believes often becomes permanent, and what becomes permanent can be indestructible.” The meaning of a word or an event is that which we ascribe to it, Obioma asserts. Coming to believe that something is true not only has the power to change one’s reality but also to invade and poison one’s memories. For Ikenna, even the earliest recollections of childhood have been warped by pain and paranoia. In their penultimate conflict, he accuses Boja,“That is why I’m not surprised when you now confess that you hate me; you always have.” Through this wrenching parable, Obioma displays the genesis of such divisory beliefs and their eventual, devastating consequences.

“We are all minorities; we are all different,” says UNESCO artist for peace and director of “The Choice” Guila Clara Kessous prior to the play’s world premiere in Sanders Theatre on Sunday. “ And we are all having a certain story, history [...] that could suddenly condemn ourselves as different because we have different parents, or because we were born somewhere in the wrong timing.” Written by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and renowned Holocaust author Elie Wiesel, “The Choice” tells the story of a resistance movement and the harrowing struggle of a duty-bound soldier assigned to select and execute one of three hostages. Protagonist Misha, played by Israeli muay thai boxing champion Ilya Grad, considers fleeing, but muses, “Wherever we go, we’ll always be obliged to choose,” introducing the audience to the play’s main theme of individual responsibility in the face of ideological conflicts.
Although the show premiered on Sunday, it was written not long after Wiesel’s 1945 liberation from Buchenwald. Specific details of its origin remain unclear, and the play was only recently rediscovered by Joel Rappel, the director of the Elie Wiesel archives at Boston University, in the course of his work compiling Wiesel’s collected writings. What is known is that the play is one of Wiesel’s earliest. “Even Elie Wiesel did not recall the existence of the play,” Rappel said in the introductory statement to Sunday’s ceremony.
“What we know is that this was the first play he wrote, but we don’t know exactly the time it was written,” Kessous says. Kessous suggests that, because of its status as an early work, “The Choice” allows viewers insight into the development of Wiesel’s writing.“This work has all of the seeds that Elie Wiesel will use to create the thematics of these future books.  Anything dealing with death, anything dealing with responsibility of having a life,” she says.
Kessous has collaborated extensively with Wiesel in the past: He served as her graduate advisor during her time at Boston University, and she previously directed the premiere of his play “Zalmen or the Madness of God." Her familiarity with Wiesel’s artistry contributed to her ability to convey his vision for this latest play. “He really wants [it] to be extremely sober,” she says. This directive gave rise to a stark set consisting of nothing but a table, covered with black cloth and surrounded by six chairs, and microphones against a background of four black and white panels displaying Holocaust survivors.
According to Kessous, despite the fact that the play derives its inspiration from the Holocaust—its release coincides closely with the 70th anniversary of Yom HaShoah, known in English as Holocaust Remembrance Day—its themes remain relevant to modern-day viewers, particularly in regard to issues of religious extremism. “It’s very close to what we are living today with fanaticism in any religion,” Kessous says. “Whenever someone suddenly talks about this being the only truth, otherwise the person cannot live—I think those are very important elements that we need to recognize so then we realize that the person is in danger and that we need to do something.”
For all of its focus on the atrocities of genocide through the eyes of its survivors, however, “The Choice” ends on an optimistic note as Misha makes the decision to disobey his orders by allowing his hostages to remain alive. It’s a message that Kessous hopes will be inspirational to those who see the play. “I do think that by doing this, I really insist about the fantastic testimony of life those people are able to tell,” Kessous says. “We can make it, if we all help and watch each other. We can make it.”

Any film that can transcend the bounds of its undeniably terrible title deserves commendation. Any film that can garner polarizing stump of an actress Kristen Stewart the Cesár Award, making her the first American woman to do so, is nothing short of a miracle. And a film in which astounding performances, a breathtaking setting, and a self-referential commentary on the modern state of cinema coalesce is truly one to remember. Directed and written by Olivier Assayas, “Clouds of Sils Maria” proves itself to be a complex, wistful examination of the psychological risks of working in a profession that fetishizes youth and sometimes blurs the line between fantasy and reality. Though the many layers of Assayas’s meta-fictional narrative occasionally threaten to cloud the proceedings with confusion, the generally superb cast and cinematography shine throughout.
The film follows the late career of Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche), an actress who rocketed to stardom after starring in William Melchior’s play “Maloja Snake” in the role of young ingenue who begins an affair with her older female boss, eventually driving her to suicide. After Melchior dies, a middle-aged Maria is approached to appear in the revival of the same show, now in the opposite role. Retreating to the idyllic mountainside town of Sils Maria, she rehearses with trusted companion and confidante Valentine (Kristen Stewart) and unearths her latent insecurities regarding their relationship, her waning career, and her own mortality.
Assayas is no stranger to dissecting the nature of celebrity, having done so previously in his critically-acclaimed satire “Irma Vep” (1996). Here, however, he uses the celestial Swiss vantage to reinforce the underlying theme of the film. Assayas imbues his shots with a soft white light, his dialogue interspersed with images of the snow-covered mountains and the crystal blue lakes of the Alps. His simple, fade-to-black tactics serve as transitions between the film’s three parts, each scene dissipating into the next like the titular clouds, delicate and ephemeral. The serene environment and ghostly shifts refreshingly render the film more of a musing on the isolation of growing older than a scathing, explicit critique on current attitudes toward women in Hollywood.
As Maria, Binoche delivers a near-flawless performance. Having worked with Assayas on 2008’s “Summer Hours,” she is clearly at ease onscreen exploring her character’s increasingly mercurial temperament. Whether unleashing a raucous laugh or weeping as she comes to terms with her age, Binoche commands every scene, her robust sexuality and thin veneer of self-confidence her sword and shield. She is at once elegant, charming, and bitterly sardonic, a gourmet wedding cake laced with arsenic. For her part, Stewart is believable as Valentine, the quick-witted, grounded counterpart to Maria. As seen in “Into the Wild” (2007) and “Adventureland” (2009), she possesses the ability to churn out a moving performance. And yet, she only impresses when she plays characters nearly identical to her offscreen persona: those in a perpetual state of discomfort, amalgamations of lip-biting, clenched teeth, and self-doubting fidgets. While her appearance in “Clouds” is admittedly poignant, it marks yet another instance when Kristen Stewart is essentially playing a slightly more endearing Kristen Stewart.
Of course, “Clouds” is not entirely blue skies. Chloe Grace Moretz’s portrayal of Jo-Ann Ellis, a talented, troubled time-bomb of a starlet set to take on Maria’s former role, is middling at best. Moretz’s flurry of snarls and curses ring half-hearted; if Jo-Ann is a firecracker, Moretz is a five-cent sparkler. But that could be Assayas’s fault: The stilted dialogue and almost cartoonish depiction of Jo-Ann that he gives Moretz to work with attests to his disdain for celebrity culture and big-budget blockbusters, which seems to get in the way of actually portraying a subtle, believable character.
Additionally, the fact that “Maloja Snake” eerily mirrors Maria and Val’s dynamic raises a number of questions—Is Val leading Maria on? Does Maria consider Val an equal or simply someone to convince her that she is still relevant?—which obfuscate rather than enhance the story. While Assayas’s efforts to pack his film with allusions, parallelisms, and the odd, heavy-handed metaphor are impressive, attempting to interpret them all not only feels exhausting but also muddles the true strength of the film: the two stellar performances.
Indeed, when Assayas puts his hand to symbolism, he seems to carve against the grain of the film. The Maloja Snake refers to a meteorological phenomenon in which clouds slither through the valleys of the Alps, silently and steadily enveloping everything in their path. Similarly, “Clouds of Sils Maria” rarely bombards the audience with a clear message; instead, the film merely outlines a plethora of ideas and allows viewers to interpret them as they will. Binoche, Stewart, and the Swiss Alps are all luminous, but it is what “Clouds” lacks— some grand, moralizing conclusion—that makes the film remarkable. Sometimes, it seems, the clouds speak louder than the storm itself.

The Crimson Staff claimed in “Trouble for Israel” that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s campaign rhetoric about Arabs and the political climate serves as a springboard to reassess U.S.-Israel relations. This type of argument is ironic when American popular support for Israel is the highest it has been since 1991, and dangerous given the security threats faced by the U.S. and Israel.
The fact that Arab voter turnout was significantly high in Israel this past election demonstrates the strength of Israeli democracy. Consider the dangerous wave of anti-Semitic attacks in Europe, the rise of neo-fascist groups in Greece and Hungary, and the far-right National Front party becoming the first-place French party in 2014 European elections and second-place in recent local elections. Where is the concern about racism in European society or a reassessment of U.S.-Europe relations? It is wrong to apply double standards by singling out Israeli internal issues.
Obama should be familiar with inflammatory election remarks (recall “They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion…”), and he too has backtracked on important foreign policy positions such as Syria’s chemical weapons use as a “red line” and underestimating the threat of ISIS and changing strategies. So the administration’s obsession with Netanyahu, especially after he made amends and clarifications, is baffling. The Crimson Staff cited other examples such as his “controversial address to Congress.” Never mind that he was invited by Speaker Boehner to address a co-equal branch of government on one of the most important foreign policy issues of the twenty-first century. Obama had the British Prime Minister lobby members of Congress to not pass new sanctions on Iran, so his real issue with Netanyahu’s speech was its content and not “protocol.” Even Senator McCain quoted an Arab leader as saying, “We believe it is more dangerous to be a friend of America’s than an enemy.” Obama’s intense rhetoric against a democratically elected leader of an ally is unbefitting and unworthy of the President of the United States.
Unfair public pressure seems to be placed on Israel regarding the peace process. The Palestinian Authority routinely glorifies terrorists, recently lost a major U.S. court case for supporting terrorism, and formed a unity government with the terrorist organization Hamas. Demanding nothing of the Palestinians and suggesting the U.S. should reconsider its Israel policy at the United Nations to apparently spite Netanyahu is morally and politically wrong. The Palestinians use the UN to get what they want and avoid making the compromises needed to realize a two-state solution through direct negotiations – compromises including accepting Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, something Palestinian President Abbas still refuses to articulate.
Let’s not magnify every Israeli issue to create an unnecessary crisis while ignoring worse realities in other countries. Let’s not create wedge issues with America’s best ally, especially when both nations are confronted by the same threats of terrorism and a nuclear-armed Iran.

‘Tis the season for strange presidential campaign announcements. Texas Senator Ted Cruz declared his candidacy for the highest office in the land to an auditorium full of Liberty University students who were compelled to attend. In a fitting act of rebellion, some wore “Stand with Rand” t-shirts to the event.
Next up was the Kentucky Senator himself, whose announcement drew merciless criticism from Jon Stewart for the large numbers of warm-up speakers that preceded it. Here, the funniest moment was undoubtedly when one such speaker exhorted to the crowd “to elect Rand Paul as the next United States of America.”
Rounding out the Republican newcomers was Marco Rubio, whose announcement was smoother, though his apparent nervousness did come in for criticism. More substantively, one wonders why a candidate who claims to represent new ideas is using a stale slogan from the wreckage of neoconservative foreign policy.
But the main event in the recent slew of presidential announcement was, of course, the long-awaited declaration of former first lady, senator, and secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Strangeness abounded here as well, from her somewhat awkward announcement video to her FedEx-like campaign logo. Again, the English language proved meddlesome: In its first iteration, Clinton’s campaign literature described how she has “fought children and families all her career.”
Compared to the wackiness of the Republican field, Clinton’s candidacy is nothing to laugh at. She appears to have a lock on the Democratic nomination. Thus, barring a catastrophe in the primaries, America may soon have its first female major party candidate for the presidency.
Clinton has long been conscious of her role as a trailblazer for women in American politics. When she lost the Democratic nomination to then-senator Barack Obama in 2008, she said, “Although we were not able to shatter that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you it has 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.”
That next time is here, and it could not have come soon enough. Congress now has the largest number of women members in its history, but they represent less than twenty percent of the bicameral body. According to one study from last year, given current trends, Congress will not reach gender parity until 2121. As of now, the U.S. Congress ranks 72nd in the world for its level of female representation.  A Clinton presidency would be a powerful sign that more equitable female representation in American politics is a 21st century issue, not a 22nd century one.
How have other countries shattered the most visible glass ceiling in politics and elected a female head of state or head of government? Well, as with the Clinton phenomenon in the United States, sometimes marriage helps. The world’s first democratically elected female head of state was Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who became Prime Minister of what was then Ceylon in 1960 after her husband, the previous Prime Minister, was assassinated. Elsewhere in South Asia, family connections proved helpful in electing Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi of India and Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, both of whom came from powerful political families. In other parts of the world, women from less political backgrounds achieved comparable “firsts.” Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom became Europe’s first female Prime Minister in 1979, and European countries like Iceland, Denmark, and Germany have all elected female heads of government since. Canada briefly had a female Prime Minister in 1993, but has never elected one. Notably, Latin America has done very well in electing women to high offices.
Can any patterns be discerned from the history of elected women leaders? Well, as one Business Insider article on the subject put it, “the facts embody the contradictions everywhere.” South Asia and Latin America are not often thought to be models of gender of equity in the Western imagination, yet they have outpaced much of the world in electing women heads of state and government. Family connections have played a role, but women leaders in these regions have operated as independently as any in the world.
Progressive northern Europe has done well in electing women to high office in recent years, but Britain has not been able to elect another Thatcher and Sweden has never had a female Prime Minister despite having a good track record electing women to Parliament. Canada has better female representation in politics than its southern neighbor, but only slightly.
However one chooses to parse the history and the data, one thing is clear: Women are still underrepresented the world over. Electing a woman as president of the most powerful country on earth would, like the election of Barack Obama, be a powerful signal that abstract notions of equality can become reality. But the varied history of elected female leaders also shows that the election of a woman as head of state or government is not a proxy for measuring a nation’s commitment to feminism. Just as Obama’s election did not usher in a post-racial utopia, the election of Hillary Clinton would not erase inequities, here or abroad. As always, whatever the outcome in 2016, immense work will remain in the struggle for equality.

If you are reading this as a student of Harvard University, something went terribly right.
You worked hard. Your family supported you. Your teacher encouraged you to apply. You had the uncommon grit to push ahead when no one believed in you.
As people who are lucky enough to be here, we sometimes forget that most of the time, for most people, the world does not work.
The world is an ethical emergency.
This year has seen a lot of those emergencies: racialized police shootings of unarmed people of color. The catastrophic effects of human-induced climate change.
Here at Harvard, we’re learning to be people with the power to impact these emergencies. To worsen them. Or to help make them better.
I worry about this literally all the time.
Because Harvard is not outside these emergencies. Harvard is a community, an industry, and a political actor. The work we do here, the communities we make here, matter beyond these brick walls. And in the past year, a lot of us have taken sometimes-controversial action to try to address these ethical emergencies right here at home.
Some of us organized a #BlackLivesMatter protest at Primal Scream. Some of us founded a magazine for racial justice. Some of us are currently participating in a week-long blockade of Massachusetts Hall, urging the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
These are causes—#BlackLivesMatter, racial justice, and climate justice—that I think most of us are behind. But some of us have felt uncomfortable about the tactics activists use to address them.
That makes sense.
Harvard has a history of rabble-rousers: civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protesters; abolitionists; Thoreau.
But the incredible odds of even getting into this place—the competition, the need to achieve—can encourage a certain type of person. A certain set of skills.
We know the stereotype: Get the grade. Toe the line. Put it on the resume. Speak up, but not too loudly. Don’t offend.
For those of us whose path to Harvard was full of familial, financial, emotional, and academic support, it can be hard to viscerally experience the ways the world hurts people. That doesn’t mean we don’t care; it means we need to exert even greater empathy to make our ethical convictions and our actions line up.
And for those of us whose path to Harvard felt nearly impossible, raising hell is risky. We’ve seen the way the world marginalizes our families, our communities, and our peers. And now that we have the opportunity for success, we’re not going to throw it away. We’re not going to risk being handled with racialized violence by police. Or risk press coverage that might lose us a job. Or stand, hyper-visible, in front of an onslaught of our drunk peers.
Often, it’s not that we’re risk-averse—it’s that we’re grateful. Harvard has changed our lives and the lives of our families. That’s an amazing, wonderful, awe-inspiring fact.
We don’t want to bite the hand that feeds us.
In the past four years, I have received over $120,000 in scholarship aid from Harvard University. I have received $8,000 in travel grants, $10,000 in on-campus jobs, $4,000 in summer employment from a Harvard-related agency, and an incalculable amount of free food.
$142,000. 142,000 reasons to be grateful. 142,000 toes not to step on. 142,000 reasons to follow the rules.
Sometimes, those $142,000 choke me.
It’s funny. The better I do here—the more confident I feel, the more my work is recognized—the scarier public dissent becomes. I worry I’ll lose what progress I have made, what honors I have accrued. I worry my home will reject me.
The better we do and the more successful we are, the bigger a stake we have in the world as it is.
But that also creates a bigger responsibility to imagine the world as it might be. To challenge the structures, the systems, the institutions that harm humans. To build better ones.
Harvard has invested $142,000 in my education. That’s a $142,000 wager that I have something different, something special, something wonderful to offer the world.
Whether or not you’re on financial aid, Harvard has made a similar bet on you.
And we’re not going to make good on that bet as long as we are too timid to act on our convictions. In ways that are unexpected. In ways that are unruly. In ways that piss people off.
Act even when that means challenging the institution that bet on us in the first place.
Bite the hand that feeds you.
Bite it with anger. Bite it with weird erotic undertones. But most of all, bite it with love.
Because, as frustrated as I sometimes get with Harvard, as much as I want to run around with my boobs out, and barricade buildings, and draw mustaches on all the busts in Annenberg, and drape John Harvard with rainbow flags, I am still in love.
A thrill still swoops through my body when I walk through Harvard Yard, the same feeling I got when I was a child in the park and I swung so high that I touched the sky with my feet.
Because it’s Harvard where I made my closest friends. Harvard where I fell in love. Harvard where I lost my virginity after brunch on a Tuesday. Harvard where I drank Ciroc at parties wearing fur, with cigarettes dangling from my fingertips, grinding with half-known men. And it is Harvard where I have sat in the sunlight in front of Massachusetts Hall urging divestment from fossil fuels.
Harvard taught me to be angry at injustice. Harvard taught me to listen. Harvard taught me to talk back. Harvard taught me how to know when Harvard is wrong. And Harvard gave me the tools to change it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Divest Harvard’s Heat Week is an impressive feat of organization: a petition with some celebrities sprinkled in, students committed enough to risk arrest, even the sheer scale of a protest covering three buildings over seven days. This Divest—which vacuums its protest spaces and asks Massachusetts Hall freshmen for permission before protesting—is a far cry from the group that ambushed President Faust with a camera before distorting her words. Protest is good, and as we have opined before, so is action on the crucial issue of climate change. But the magnitude of the protest must correspond both with the severity of the problem and the effectiveness of the solution. It is here that we find Divest Harvard lacking. Unfortunately, as much as ever, divestment works toward the noble end of combating climate change through unproductive, unlikely, and ineffectual means.
Divest has articulated no link between divestment and emissions reduction. It has suggested that divestment by a university as prominent as Harvard might have an impact, but upon whom is highly unclear. Previous divestments by similarly prominent universities have failed to move the needle. So too has a worldwide consensus of 97 percent of qualified climate scientists, the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and sustained international and domestic advocacy by, among others, President Obama. What attention will Harvard focus on this issue that the entire scientific community, round-the-clock CNN coverage of burning oil rigs, and several State of the Union addresses were unable to bring? Harvard may be special, but it is not that special.
Even Divest Harvard acknowledges the lack of a viable alternative to fossil fuels, but argues that this is due to the oil industry’s chilling effect on research. If so, let us make Harvard a bastion for research and education so that the breakthrough alternative fuel is found here in Cambridge.
Harvard can contribute by leveraging its strengths: not a national soapbox, but world-class research abilities. As President Faust has stated, Harvard does critical research on climate science and policy, including $71 million in spending since 2009 on climate research (ironically, approximately the size of Harvard’s holdings in fossil fuel companies). Harvard’s research-oriented work has involved low-carbon urban planning, studies of climate accords, and electric vehicle technology. As a university, we have reduced our emissions footprint by 29 percent per capita in the past several years. Harvard furthermore works toward progress in climate change by engaging with fossil fuel companies and advocating for better sustainability there—which could not be done if we were to divest. As a stakeholder and research institution, Harvard is best poised to make progress on climate change through education, engagement in the political process (an option certainly not available to the University or its students when Harvard partially divested from the South African apartheid regime), and open conversation.
And Harvard has definitely been willing to have that conversation, even with regards to divestment. Divest may claim that President Faust is unwilling to engage them in meaningful dialogue, but the administration's numerous overtures to the contrary tell a different story. For example, Faust participated in an open forum in March, but while Divest Harvard members leafletted outside, they did not take the opporunity to engage her.
Fundamentally, the advocacy of Divest Harvard, impassioned and moving as it may be, is stopped cold in its tracks by the unfortunate brute force of economic logic. The oil industry reported nearly $100 billion in profit last year, and Big Oil has no plans to simply pack up and leave if universities divest. After all, another investor will surely buy any shares Harvard might sell. Especially given our dependence on fossil fuels and the corresponding hypocrisy of rejecting fossil fuel companies on moral grounds (by contrast, when students advocated tobacco divestment, they did not exactly smoke cigarettes at their rallies), divestment simply is not the best path forward. A carbon-free economy cannot involve fossil fuels. At its core, Divest Harvard has no strategy to make that a reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now that Harvard’s new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration has received final approval from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, English professor Martin Puchner—who spearheaded the initiative to create the concentration—is turning his efforts to attracting prospective concentrators, including both current students and admitted members of the Class of 2019.
“In the past, the Admissions Office has admitted theater performance-oriented students, but those have tended to go to our competitors,” he said. “I think we are now in a much better position to both capture the students we have admitted in the past, but also to put a finger on the scale a little bit to yield new students in that area.”
According to the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, 15 percent of admitted students to the Class of 2019 indicated that they intended to concentrate in the humanities, up from 13.6 percent last year. While Puchner has not formally calculated the number of students potentially concentrating in Theater, Dance, and Media, he said that he has heard from “many” current and prospective students who are interested in the concentration.
“We are seeing discussion about the new concentration on the Class of 2019 Facebook group and they are very excited about it,” said Amy A. Lavoie, director of digital communication at the Admissions Office.
One interested student is Eliza B. Mantz ’18, who said she believes the new concentration will enrich her liberal arts experience and help her become a better performer.
“Harvard could now be the perfect place where I could continue my formal education, and also get an incredible arts education,” she said. “The concentration will [make] good artists, people who can appreciate craft from a distance and also do it.”
However, the concentration was not approved in time to host a freshman Advising Fortnight event, frustrating students with the lack of resources currently available.
“I am pretty disappointed about how much information we’ve gotten about it. All I know about it is what I’ve read in the Crimson articles,” said Caro P. Ribeiro ’18, a prospective concentrator.
Puchner said the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration partnered with the Admissions Office and its alumni interviewers to promote Harvard’s humanities resources.
According to admissions officer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12, the Admissions Office is currently working with the Division of Arts and Humanities to promote Harvard’s humanities resources. Gilfillian said that during this year’s Visitas, prospective students can expect a “Meet, Greet, and Listen” event at the Barker Center Arts Cafe to meet faculty from across the division.
“It will be an amazing moment for students to talk about the concentration, as the new concentration offers an exciting and interdisciplinary look into what the humanities is all about,” he said.
According to Diana Sorensen, dean of arts and humanities, the new concentration is an important piece in a larger campaign to attract humanities concentrators.
“We wanted to make sure we took a step in the direction of Theater, Dance, and Media both because we believe in that field, but also because we’re trying to make Harvard appeal to people with artistic ambitions,” Sorensen said in an interview earlier this year.
Puchner emphasized that the concentration will not be selectively capped or require an audition and that its courses will be made widely available to both concentrators and non-concentrators.
Sorensen said Harvard’s theater concentration will benefit from arriving relatively late to the field, since its organizers have “learned from what works or doesn’t work” at comparable institutions.
The Committee on Dramatic Arts will host an open forum on the pedagogy of theater at Harvard next Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Public service, even for Harvard graduates, is no lucrative field.
About 65 percent of employed 2013 graduates of the Master in Public Policy program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government are working in the public or nonprofit sector, according to the Kennedy School Office of Career Advancement. Alumni working in local government have the highest median salary out of these graduates, at $67,500, 35 percent more than the median salary of $50,000 for those working in intergovernmental organizations.
Yet even $67,500 pales in comparison to the $160,000 median salary of 2013 Harvard Law School graduates, nearly 60 percent of whom worked at law firms. It’s also a far cry from the $120,000 median salary and $25,000 median signing bonus of Harvard Business School graduates from the same year, 95 percent of whom work outside of the government and non-profit world.
In addition to this discrepancy in alumni earnings between the Kennedy School and some of the University’s flagship graduate schools, the Kennedy School has a relatively smaller and younger alumni base because its classes are smaller and its core degree programs were developed later.
As it strives to raise $500 million in its portion of Harvard’s record-seeking $6.5 billion capital campaign, then, the Kennedy School cannot turn to its alumni base in the same way as the Business or Law Schools. Its fundraising strategy is based on a different model, relying heavily on gifts from donors who are not school alumni.
BY THE NUMBERS
As of February, the Kennedy School had raised $383 million in its segment of Harvard’s record-seeking fundraising drive. According to Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel, though the school’s alumni constitute the majority—75 percent—of donors who contributed to that sum, their contributions in dollars make up only about 20 percent of the whole.
The remaining 80 percent of funds raised or pledged came from donors who did not graduate from the Kennedy School. Those gifts come from individual non-alumni donors, foundations, and corporate sources. The trend of non-alumni giving at the Kennedy School is consistent both for major gifts in particular and across the board, according to Christy Jackowitz, the school’s assistant dean for alumni relations and resource development.
Compared to Harvard overall, a greater proportion of Kennedy School fundraising comes from non-alumni.
On average, non-alumni contributed 66 percent of giving Harvard-wide in 2014, according to Ann E. Kaplan, the director of the Voluntary Support of Education Survey at the Council for Aid to Education. At private research institutions generally, on average, non-alumni contribute to 72 percent of giving.
According to Gavel, 20 percent of all Kennedy School alumni have donated to the school during the campaign so far. This participation rate is more than twice the average 8.3 percent alumni giving rate for all colleges and universities reported in the 2014 VSE survey. It is just more than half of Harvard College’s 2006 alumni giving rate, which at 39 percent was a 17-year low at the time.
“One thing to recognize about the Kennedy School is that the vast majority of our money...comes from people who aren’t even Harvard graduates,” Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 said in February. “That means they are investing in an institution where they believe deeply in our capacity to do something [to] either educate a group of leaders or provide answers to problems they care about.”
Pitching the Kennedy School’s purpose as a government school may be key to landing donations from non-alumni. Paul G. Schervish, the director of Boston College’s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy, said resonance with the school’s mission is a key motivating force for non-alumni donors.
“I often say [that] the major mobilizing factor of philanthropy is identification—so identification with its mission, and what leads to identification is association [with HKS affiliates],” Schervish said.
For long-time University and Kennedy School donor Peter L. Malkin ’55, for instance, it was the Kennedy School’s “unique training ground for leaders” that first attracted him to the school, which he did not attend.
“For many people who are outside of academia, while there’s a great appreciation for the very important research that’s done at Harvard...the everyday exciting things are really taking place at the Kennedy School,” Malkin said, pointing to the Institute of Politics’s biennial program for newly-elected members of Congress as a practical manifestation of the school’s mission.
As for the school’s popularity with non-alumni abroad, philanthropy expert Richard A. Marker highlighted the brand power of Harvard—and by extension, its international arm, the Kennedy School—as key.
“If you’re an international player and you want to identify yourself with a safe and prestigious cause, whether or not Harvard is always going to be the right place, or does the most creative things...or even the things most relevant to that country…if you want there to be media recognition...you’re going to choose Harvard,” Marker said. “To be identified with a quality, high-prestige institution even for a head of state is something that has appeal.”
Schervish added that the Kennedy School’s national prominence, curriculum, and various fellowship programs likely facilitated “connections to an elite financial group” and “rosters of major actors” in politics that established a strong network with wealthy non-alumni philanthropists.
STRINGS ATTACHED?
While the Kennedy School’s broad appeal as a government school may land it a wide base of donors, it has another consequence: for better or worse, what comes with its relatively large proportion of non-alumni donations focused on the school’s mission is what Ellwood terms “prescriptive gifts.”
“They don’t give you large sums of money to do whatever what the dean wants—that just doesn’t happen, whereas [elsewhere] that can happen,” Ellwood said. “Anytime someone is a donor, they’re going to have something they care about.”
Kennedy School Executive Dean John A. Haigh characterized Kennedy School donors as largely “giving through” rather than “giving to” the school, entrusting the school with their money to effectively work on a particular policy area in which their interests lie.
Ellwood emphasized, however, that the Kennedy School carefully evaluates each gift and philanthropist in relation to the school’s mission and “turn[s] down gifts all the time.”
“One always has to be thoughtful about whether the support that’s coming in advances your agenda as opposed to diverts you,” Ellwood said, adding that the issue is a “generic one” that is especially true for large gifts.
If, for example, a donor approached the school to fund a fellowship for Indonesian students, Jackowitz said, the school would first evaluate if they would receive enough qualified applicants from Indonesia to warrant the fellowship and would likely ask the donor to “broaden” his or her gift to an entire region to ensure greater success.
Ellwood said any “sizable donation is a discussion” and that donors recognize that a gift towards an endeavor the school does not intend to pursue will not benefit either party.
“You’re not going to get the kind of attention and energy you want [and] you’re just going to be fighting with each other forever,” Ellwood said. “Whereas by contrast, if you give it to something the school really believes in and is excited about, then you’re going to find that the money is going to leverage, because other people are going to get excited.”
With this significant non-alumni financial presence and much of the Kennedy School’s advisory Dean’s Council made up of non-graduates, a possible concern, according to Marker, is that the school could change in academic values and priorities in response to “prescriptive” donations.
“I don’t mean to be coarse, but there’s no question that if you have a private college…it’s harder for the academic integrity to stand up to a big gift,” Marker said. “[But] Harvard is not going to sell its academic integrity to the highest bidder.”
According to Marker, what could happen, however, is a shift in the Kennedy School’s existing academic priorities. Items that might have been number five on the school’s priorities list, said Marker, might move to the top of the list based on where “money has arrived.”
Still, Schervish said, “Harvard is not a beggar.” He said while there is perhaps some non-material satisfaction granted to donors—such as honors and naming buildings—there is almost certainly no quid pro quo resulting from donations that could result in unethical behavior.
“It’s what the University has that attracts the donations…rather than changing a policy of the University—you might want to approve or add a dimension, but it’s not going to be able to affect the [thought],” Schervish said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Protesters from environmental activist group Divest Harvard have done their very best to get administrators’ attention this week.
More than four days into its "Heat Week" of protests demanding that Harvard divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels, the activist group has blocked the staff entrances to Massachusetts Hall, where Faust keeps her office, and also targeted University Hall and the Harvard Alumni Association.
Last May, a Divest Harvard member, Brett A. Roche ’15, was arrested as he blocked a door to Mass. Hall. The group’s newest exhibition of civil disobedience has not unfolded the same way. So far, police and protesters have interacted amicably, and many University leaders have simply accepted the inconvenience, skipping the complaints and instead deciding whether to open their laptops in Widener Library, Starbucks, or Au Bon Pain.
"We've been very flexible," said Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, who stopped by to greet the protesters en route to the library on Thursday morning. "I’m just wandering around campus; it's good exercise."
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has also visited the protests and talked with students. Like Smith, he was relocated largely without complaint.
"We have a lot of offices all over the place, so if there's a spare conference room, a spare room some place, I've worked out of there,” he said Thursday. “I've worked out of the Charles Hotel lobby.”
The most visibly inconvenienced has been Faust, who normally walks unencumbered through Harvard’s campus but this week has been preceded and accompanied by a swelled protective detail of officers from the Harvard University Police Department. And yet despite the changes in routine, Faust waited until Thursday to address the protests, offering the demonstrators a meeting on the condition that they end their blockade.
The response is not exactly what Divest Harvard was looking for when it announced its planned "Heat Week" of protests. Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, the group’s co-founder, responded to Faust’s email by requesting a meeting with Faust as well as the Harvard Corporation “to formally negotiate divestment.”
Faust wrote back Thursday night and criticized the group for "the substantial disruption your activities have caused." Faust wrote, however, that she remains willing to meet with the protesters.
In an interview Thursday night, Maxmin called Faust’s original message more of the same and said the group was not satisfied.
“We’ve been to Faust’s office hours many many times over the past three years, and we’ve valued those opportunities to engage with her, but those conversations have not been productive,” Maxmin said on Thursday night. “It is frustrating to hear the same statement and to have the same conversation over and over again.”
So far, however, "Heat Week" has unfolded without the change in message Divest Harvard seeks. The group’s civil disobedience, moreover, has not caused Harvard’s police to react in the way officers did when they arrested Roche last year and prompted Divest Harvard to celebrate the then-junior in public statements as “the first student arrested in fossil fuel divestment history.”
Maxmin said Thursday night that "Heat Week" will end, as planned, on Friday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2015, at 12:05 a.m.
Students have raised concerns that the Bureau of Study Counsel's administrative move to the College's purview may compromise their privacy, but the College maintains that it will not.
Administrators will not use information gathered from students’ meetings with BSC counselors for disciplinary purposes, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email.
Although sensitive student information may be shared among the BSC and College administrators on a need-to-know basis, “it is important for students to be able to have private conversations about their thoughts and feelings with knowledgeable advisors,” Dane wrote on behalf of Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
Dane also wrote that “the discussion of, say, integrity violations with a BSC staff member will not lead to disciplinary action, and BSC staff will not share this information with anyone without the student’s permission.”
Harris could not be reached for comment Thursday evening when asked whether BSC tutors and counselors will simply be not required to report sensitive information, or whether they will be explicitly prohibited from reporting it. In addition, he could not be reached for comment on whether the BSC will only refrain from implicating students not already in disciplinary cases, or if protection of privacy would also extend to students already called before the Administrative Board.
During a two-hour town hall meeting earlier this month, students raised concerns about potential changes in student privacy that might arise from the BSC’s administrative transfer from Harvard University Health Services, governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, to the College, governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
While under UHS for the past 11 years, the BSC was subject to HIPPA, which “helps protect the confidentiality and security of healthcare information,” Dane wrote in her email. Under the College administration, the BSC will be subject to FERPA, which “protects the privacy of student education records,” according Dane.
HIPAA prevents student information—including whether the student had made use of BSC services—from being shared with administrators and faculty members outside of UHS without written consent from the student.
FERPA will allow BSC staff members “to share information with other professionals within the College on a strict need-to-know basis,” Dane wrote, adding that “this is the same high standard of privacy that applies to student records, financial aid status, and other student information.”
One of the BSC’s services, peer-tutoring, was never governed by HIPAA, but, rather, was subject to FERPA, according to Dane.
“The BSC will continue with its current policy, which is not to inform faculty about a student’s participation in peer tutoring without the student’s permission,” Dane wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Kennedy School of Government Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 steps down at the end of the academic year, the school may lose one of its most potent fundraising assets.
In a February interview, Ellwood said he expected fundraising to “inevitably slow down” once the new dean comes on board, explaining that since the “vast majority of [HKS’s] money comes from people who aren’t even Harvard graduates,” philanthropy is based on confidence, trust, and long-term relationships that could be interrupted or stalled by the transition.
“I would be very surprised if our fundraising pattern didn’t slow down some in the next few years,” Ellwood said. “So it’s one of the reasons that it seemed...important for me to stay through this year—[I] want to make sure we are in very good shape.”
As of this February, the Kennedy School had raised $383 million toward its $500 capital campaign goal.
Kennedy School Executive Dean John A. Haigh credits Ellwood with bringing financial stability to the school in the wake of the dot-com bust through “aggressive management activities to both generate incremental revenue and to manage [HKS’s] structure effectively.”
“One of things that personally I take pride in, and I think David does too, is that we have run surpluses on what we refer to as our unrestricted budget every year since David has taken over as dean,” Haigh said. “We’ve been able to build up significant research programs and research balances from a funding perspective which enables our faculty to conduct their research in a way most comfortable to them.”
Charles J. Haight, senior associate dean of alumni relations and resource development at the Kennedy School, said he was not sure if a “recalibration” in response to Ellwood’s departure would necessarily result in a drop of donations, emphasizing also that the capital campaign’s goals extended beyond dollars raised.
“The notion that campaigns just raise money I think is wrong, because campaigns also raise awareness and enable us to engage important constituencies—such as alumni,” Haight said. “We think of alumni activity as a whole, including giving.  Making gifts is not an outcome of engagement but, indeed, another element of engagement, whether the donor is an alum or not.”
One of Ellwood’s major contributions in his 10 years as dean, according to his colleagues at the Kennedy School, has been establishing a solid financial future for the school. Ellwood also said he personally considers the increase in financial aid at the Kennedy School, from $11 million to $23 million annually during his tenure, as his biggest achievement.
“Dean Ellwood is just a great dean in all of kinds of ways, but he’s certainly truly distinguished in the area of attracting philanthropic support to the Kennedy School,” Haight said.
Officials have not named Ellwood's successor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Governor of Maryland Martin J. O’Malley spoke at the Institute of Politics on Thursday about the choices and policies needed to build a more prosperous American economy and a stronger middle class.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by IOP Director Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams, came less than three months after the end of O’Malley’s second term as governor. O’Malley, who is widely viewed as a possible Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential election, said on Thursday that he is “strongly considering” a presidential campaign and will announce any plans by the end of May. 
O’Malley opened his address by contrasting what he called America’s historical “inclusive theory of growth” focused on extending the American dream to “ever-widening circles of our people” with the inequitable capital accumulation and concentration of wealth that he said resulted from Ronald Reagan’s “supply-side economics.”
“From 1947 to 1979, every income group of households in the United States, from the poorest to the richest, were able to increase their earnings by at least 100% in real, inflation-adjusted dollars over that forty year period of time,” he said. “All of that progress was built on hard work, extending economic participation, and policy choices that made sure that wages [increased with] productivity.”
O’Malley pointed to the recent financial crisis as proof of the unreliability and inequity of the theories driving the modern American economic system and called for a restoration of “a human purpose to our American economy.” O’Malley presented a five-part plan for economic change that would focus on wage policies, public investments, financial accountability, better trade deals, and expanded Social Security.
O’Malley said he supported a $15 minimum wage and the indexation of the minimum wage for inflation, as well as reduced barriers to collective bargaining and immigration reform, which he called an “economic imperative for our entire country.”
“We must recognize that policies that are good for women and families like paid leave, and stay-at-home affordable childcare, are also good for our national economy and for economic growth—because [when] women succeed, our American economy also succeeds,” he said.
O’Malley also said that in contrast to many of the nation’s political leaders, he wants to expand the Social Security program, arguing that “we cannot grow our economy if we resign a whole generation of our senior citizens to live in their golden years in poverty.”
He proposed funding the expansion by raising the earnings cap on payroll taxes, passing immigration reform to allow an additional 11 million people to contribute to the program, and enacting progressive wage policies.
“We are Americans, and we make our own destiny,” O’Malley concluded. “We are standing at the threshold of a new era of American progress—and we need only the will and the leadership to move forward to the future we prefer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has not yet fully staffed the centralized office that is in charge of investigating reports of sexual harassment, more than nine months after administrators announced its creation.
When administrators unveiled Harvard's new Title IX policy last summer, they lauded the creation of the central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, whose professional investigators would hear complaints filed against students from across the University and bring Harvard’s approach to the issue into consistency across schools.
But several weeks after the office opened, Harvard had yet to hire two of its three full time investigator positions and began bringing in contract help. In an email Thursday, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga confirmed that ODR has still not filled the two investigator position vacancies.
The office has, however, determined the fate of a donation from student activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better, raised by the group through a satirical bake sale meant to draw attention to what organizers argued was a lack of institutional support for the office. In September, Harvard was offering a salary range for the position that some experts argued was too low.
Pitched outside Lamont Library with chai spiced snickerdoodle cookies last December, undergraduates packed over $100 in donations into a glass jar, unsure how the Title IX office would allocate the funds even if it were to accept the money.
As it turns out, Harvard has taken them up on the offer. Earlier this month, Our Harvard Can Do Better posted a verification receipt of $163 in donations to the recording secretary’s office on the group’s Facebook page.
Proceeds from the bake sale will go toward printing new brochures on Harvard’s sexual harassment policy and procedures, according to deLuzuriaga.
University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides will use the donation to print 150 copies of sexual violence brochures before handing them off to members of Our Harvard Can Do Better for distribution, according to deLuzuriaga. Our Harvard Can Do Better’s Jessica R. Fournier ’17 said others should also be able to donate to ODR.
The brochure, which the Title IX office published online earlier this semester, comes after Our Harvard Can Do Better called for additional clarity in the University’s Title IX policy and procedures and the release of secondary materials explaining it. Some students have specifically criticized the new policy for its lack of an explicit affirmative consent clause.
The brochure lists sexual harassment resources and features answers to questions about sexual violence and consent. The brochure also includes clarifications about the University’s definition of consent, stipulating that the “the absence of a ‘no’ does not by itself mean ‘yes’” and that welcomeness cannot be “inferred” from an individual’s clothing, gender, race, or sexual identity.
Karvonides wrote in an email late last month that she would be meeting with various student groups and offices to solicit feedback and finalize the brochure.
Members of Our Harvard Can Do Better praised the brochure for its clear language, but argued that Harvard should expedite the release of additional supplementary materials and ensure that they are accessible to all students.
“We need more materials that are in the rhetoric and language and accessibility level as the brochure,” Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17 said.
Organizers added that the “central issues” that prompted them to host the bake sale in December still remain, as they await additional supplementary materials and the University to fully staff ODR.
“It’s on Harvard to actually substantively commit to funding this office… and getting it fully operational,”  Fournier said.
The Title IX office also includes two documents on its website designed for Harvard staff: one summarizes the staff procedures and the other provides a glossary of terms those procedures use. Additional materials are “coming soon,” according to the site.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, teams from across the Ivy League will gather in Princeton, N.J. to see who can prevail as the champion of the Ancient Eight in women's rugby sevens.
Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton and Yale will compete for the title in a round-robin style tournament. Having won the fall season of rugby 15s and performing well so far in sevens play, the Brown Bears enter the competition as the team to beat.
A championship could extend Harvard’s season, as the Ivy League tournament serves to build a resume for the American Collegiate Rugby Association Sevens National Championship in two weeks.
Coming off an Ivy championship in 2013, Harvard had a less successful fall season, going 3-2 in the Ivy League. The Crimson relish an opportunity to redeem itself with a solid performance in this weekend’s contests.
However, the lack of previous sevens competition between Ivy League squads makes prediction a difficult art. Outside of this weekend’s tournament, there is no official Ancient Eight sevens play.
Despite going into the tournament with various question marks, the Crimson players were optimistic about their play and their chances at securing a conference title.
“Last week in Providence, R.I., I think we showed the best teamwork of the season,” senior co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “I’m really excited to see what kind of play we can bring to the field this weekend.”
Getting senior Cheta Emba scoring will be a big part of the Crimson’s game plan going into the weekend.
The two-sport athlete, who also kept the net for the Harvard women’s soccer team this fall, has been lighting up the scoreboard this season for the Crimson. Last weekend, Emba scored her team’s only tries and will need to continue to produce points if Harvard hopes to secure the conference title.
However, Emba is only one of the seven players on the field, which Kantor was quick to point out.
“Cheta is a strong runner,” Kantor said. “[She] has scored a lot of points, but what has allowed her to do that is the passing and intensity of everyone else on the field.”
After last weekend’s Sorsensen Cup in Providence, R.I., the Crimson will look to bounce back in what is its most meaningful competition of the spring season.
In last week's competition, Harvard started out with a promising tie against Brown. In the next two games, however, the Crimson faced some of the best teams in collegiate rugby in Army, Norwich, and Quinnipiac, with all three opponents scoring victories over Harvard.
The weekend seems to be a motivating factor for the Crimson, which partly views this upcoming competition as an opportunity for revenge against the Bears.
“We played Brown last weekend,” Kantor stated.  “We tied them first, but they were able to squeak out a win in the second. I don’t think that game is going to be representative of this weekend.”
Harvard will need to overcome a slough of injuries this weekend, as a handful of key contributors—including two of the three co-captains—will be sidelined with injuries. While the injuries will no doubt be a factor, there are various quality players lined up to replace their teammates.
“We have people suffering from injuries,” Kantor said. “I happen to be one of them, but it doesn’t diminish the quality of players on the field. They’ve been working so hard.”
Playing at Rickerson Field in the ninth annual Rickerson Cup, the teams will be playing not only for a title but also for a good cause, with all proceeds and donations going to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.
“We are so excited to host the 9th annual Rickerson Cup this Saturday,” said Stephanie Diu, junior vice president of the Princeton sevens. “Since we started this event, our combined efforts have cumulatively raised over $235,000 and we look forward to contributing more this weekend.”

When freshman distance runner Elianna Shwayder lined up for each cross country race her senior year of high school, her ears listened for the gunshot, but her mind was in prayer.
“For the King, then the ring.”
Just before the football team storms onto the field for the opening kickoff, junior defensive back Scott Peters stands calmly, deep in thought. Jesus first, championship second.
“Blessed to be here.”
As one of her coaches tells members of the women’s basketball team they are all “lucky to be here,” sophomore forward Maggie Hartman silently replaces a word.
For many of Harvard’s religious athletes, who are the minority on Harvard’s secular campus, mantras like these have become a part of the practice and game routine. Just 22 percent of respondents surveyed in The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2018 who identified as recruited athletes also indicated that they are either “religious” or “very religious.”
While faith comes in many forms at Harvard for all students, 60 percent of self-identified recruited athletes indicated that they were Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Only 2 percent of respondents self-identified as Muslim, Buddhist, Mormon, or Hindu, though 12 percent did choose “other” as their descriptor.
The religious athletes interviewed for this story, most of whom identify as Christian, say they are lovers of God first, athletes second. The end of their artform is, in their own words, the glorification of God and the display of appreciation for the talents they have been given. But following that path is not always easy.
Some tell tales of the faithless stigma they say surrounds Harvard in their hometowns. Apprehensive of what they might find at an institution perceived by others as “godless,” they say that to their surprise, they found that faith is alive and well on campus, and many have found faith communities both within and beyond their teams.
However, some athletes struggle to maintain a balance between faith and the rigorous demands of collegiate athletics. As Harvard’s most famous Christian athlete—Los Angeles Lakers point guard Jeremy Lin ’10—says, on-campus temptations that might lead students away from their faith abound.
The struggle can also go beyond simple questions of faith; while some students are able to seamlessly integrate faith into athletics, others struggle with the practical and personal aspects of living up to the expectations for both their faith and their performance.
When he was a high school senior, Peters listened to warnings about the perceived perils of his new collegiate environment.
“I can’t even begin to count the amount of people that said, ‘I’m praying for you as you go into the spiritual wasteland,’” Peters says.
Growing up in a suburb in Atlanta, “smack dab in the Bible Belt,” Peters came from a home that was strong in Christian faith and spent summers at Christian sports camps.
He is not the only one to have had experience with the stigma of “godless Harvard.” For a number of student-athletes, going to Harvard also meant facing disapproval in the eyes of their communities.
“Harvard is looked at as...an evil,” junior women’s basketball forward AnnMarie Healy says, half-joking. There were some members of her largely-Christian community who discouraged her parents from letting her go to Cambridge, she says, warning them that attending Harvard would cause her faith to suffer.
For select student-athletes, choosing to go to Harvard came hand in hand with a fear that their commitments to faith would be negatively affected, and that they would come out changed individuals.
But those fears turned out to be unfounded, they say. To the contrary, they have found religious life on the campus to be vibrant and strong.
“There are so many people who are are living radical lives for Christ, and that’s the reality,” Healy says.
Reverend Jonathan Walton, the Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, echoes Healy’s sentiment.
“I’ve never understood this whole ‘godless Harvard’ thing,” he says. “As long as there [are] individuals here that come from strong communities of faith and carry that in their heart[s], this is a university that will be strong in and with its relationship to faith communities.”
Beyond his work with students in his academic and religious positions, Walton also serves as the faculty adviser for the men’s basketball team. His duties and self-proclaimed love of basketball have kept him particularly close with the team; his travel activities with faith-based campus organizations like Christian Impact and Athletes In Action have put him in close contact with other Crimson athletes as well.
According to Walton, the discipline, routine, and reliance on teammates he sees in many Harvard athletes is strongly correlated with the character, commitment, and trust in a higher power that comes along with leading a spiritual life.
“I can tell you one thing—when I watch the women’s basketball team, women’s water polo team, football, men’s basketball team, you can tell that there’s something spiritual, there’s something religious about their relationship,” he says. “You can see the ways that they rely on each other and depend on each other, and they’re working towards a common good.”
Peters was pleased to discover spiritual elements of his team that are not only perhaps subtle and inherent, as Walton describes, but also much more clearly tied to his own religion. Having arrived at Harvard afraid that he would be the only Christian on the team—perhaps even at the school—he was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite scenario. In fact, he estimates half of the football team is Christian.
“It was such an answer to prayer, the people that got put on the team,” he says. “Football was like my way into finding a faith community at Harvard…. [The] avenue was paved by football guys ahead of me.”
Peters found community through faith and football. In addition to spending time with his teammates on the field, he and his teammates also bond during the football team’s Ironmen Bible study. Named after Proverbs 27:17, “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another,” the group, of which Peters is a regular attendee, meets each week on Wednesdays to check in with one another and delve into scripture.
“It fosters relationships outside of class lines,” he says. “It creates cool relationships between guys that aren’t in the same grade, [and] that’s a big part of faith on the team.”
Peters is not the only one who has discovered a strong faith community within the Athletic Department; the Ironmen Bible study is only one of many such gatherings around campus.
Healy hosts a women’s athlete Bible study in her fourth-floor Kirkland room. There, she talks with fellow attendees, close together in conversation and then prayer. Recently, the group discussed what it meant to be a leader, modeling the conversation around Mother Teresa, whom Healy jokingly referred to as “the bomb dot com.”
These community-oriented elements of faith can extend beyond the Harvard athlete community and trickle into the team-specific community as well. According to Healy, the women’s basketball team is heavily Christian, and faith is a fundamental part of the team dynamic. Players hold prayers before each game, and many teammates attend weekly services together on Sundays. During J-Term, Healy held a teamwide Bible study.
Before tough conditioning days in the fall, Hartman says, her basketball teammates write “AO1” on their wrists. The phrase means “audience of one,” to indicate that “no matter what you’re doing, it’s for Christ, and [only he’s] going to judge you for that.”
“And as long as you’re giving everything that you have, that’s enough,” she says.
Although for some teams, faith is an explicit part of team culture, in others, a team-oriented faith community is built unintentionally.
Some players, like men’s basketball sophomore shooting guard Corbin Miller, who is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, have applied some of the coaches’ and players’ inspirational words in a religious context.
“[Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker]’s got quotes and saying[s] that he gives us every day,” he says. “There’s one...to the effect of, ‘Don’t mistake routine for commitment.’ And so when I hear things like that, there’s a lot I can tie into not only sports but [also] in life and my beliefs.”
“In the Mormon religion, there’s a lot of commandments, there’s rules that we follow, and it’s easy to routinely get into things but miss the mark of why you do it,” he adds.
Not all religious athletes have found a faith community on their team, however. Senior lightweight rower Josh Shih says that save for a few exceptions, he does not really talk about his faith with other members of the team. His experiences with faith have been primarily individual.
“I guess I’m looking for opportunities for where it can happen,” he says. “Now that I’m a senior, I’m also thinking about ways to possibly have those types of conversations.”
“My hope is that… at some point [faith] would become a part of our team culture,” he adds.
The experiences of sophomore golfer Kendrick Vinar have been largely similar to Shih’s. Outside of attending weekly church services with a teammate, his religious experience has largely been independent of the golf team.
However, the lack of a religious community on the team has not stopped his faith from influencing the way he competes. For Vinar, God always comes before golf. Whether he plays and how well he plays has “little external consequence.”
“When I play, my identity and self-worth isn’t wrapped up in my performance,” he says. “Everything is kind of secondary [to faith], and for me I find that super liberating. It helps me play better when I can frame things in a different perspective.”
Vinar is not the only one who finds faith a calming force amid the turmoil and pressure of collegiate competition. From silent prayers during TV breaks to locker room meditation, many of Harvard’s religious student-athletes grasp for a moment of quietude in the midst of the intensity—this, they say, helps both their faith and their game.
Athletes express their faith on the field in a myriad of ways. Lin’s pre-game handshake with former Knicks teammate Landry Fields: read a page of the “Bible”—mimicked by Fields’ hands—and point up. Tim Tebow’s kneel in the endzone: a pause to give silent thanks to God for his success. Healy’s free throw routine: As she will tell you, it is all about a simple rhythm.
Dribble, father, dribble, son, dribble, the Holy Spirit. In her head: “Father, Son, Holy Ghost. You are the one I love the most.”
Swish.
It happens in her head, each of the 100 times she has gone to the free throw line in her Crimson career.
Amidst the colliding bodies over the grassy expanse of the football field, Peters too has found that God is a way to take a step back in order to find calm and poise. For the junior, chaos defines the game of football. From the locker room right before the game “when guys are losing their minds because they are just trying to pump themselves up,” to the final few seconds—“it’s chaos until the last whistle,” he says.
Religion is his tool to navigate the intensity. A reprieve, he calls it.
“I can’t allow football to be an idol...I can’t allow it to become more important than my faith, because once I do, then that’s when my emotions—my physical, my mental well-being—can be affected by a game,” he says.
While Lin, who is widely regarded as the greatest basketball player to come out of Harvard, has enjoyed considerable success on the court both in Cambridge and beyond, he encountered personal difficulty when he first joined the team as then a rare outwardly practicing Christian.
It was a matter of isolation. Lin had come from a Christian family, 3,000 miles away in Palo Alto, Calif. Not being surrounded by Christian friends was unusual for him. He had grown up in the backyard of his dream school, but that school—Stanford—rejected him. He recalls not feeling terribly excited to go to Harvard.
Not every team at Harvard has a strong core of religious members like the women’s basketball team or the football team. Some of Harvard’s Christian athletes find themselves to be among the few religious players on the team.
Such was the case for Lin. Over the phone, he recalls struggling spiritually at Harvard for his first year and a half. Being a rare Christian on the men’s basketball team was, as he says, “very difficult.” He says joining a faith community outside of the team helped a lot.
“Push and pull” is how he describes his relationship with the team.
“For me I was like the only Christian, pretty much,” he says. “[My teammates] would make fun of me or make fun of Christianity or make fun of God…. I would get in these theological debates on the back of the bus.”
Lin says his mentality ultimately came down to trying to influence others more than they influenced him.
“Do I end up talking like they talk, or do they end up talking like I talk? Do I end up living a lifestyle like they live, or do they end up living a lifestyle like I live?” he says.
When it comes to cursing, which Lin avoids, he says his teammates gradually began to curse less around him.
“[It was] not because I ever said anything or judged them,” he recalls. “It happened naturally, [and] we never talked about it.” Over time, he grew closer to his fellow hoops players, and by his senior year he had invited them to a Bible study he held in his room in Leverett House.
For Lin, each and every action is one of worship. He avoids letting basketball define him—for him, basketball is a tool, a means, a platform through which he aims to glorify God.
“I don’t play for my personal glory, or money, or fame, or the fans,” he says. “I don’t play for other people. I play for God, and that gives me a certain type of freedom.”
Lin is not the only one to place his faith before his sport. Miller took two years off from shooting a basketball to pursue a mission trip in Mexico. Miller went through the college basketball recruitment process already knowing he would take off for his mission after his freshman year.
Like Lin, Miller echoed the sentiment that faith called him to go against the current at times. While it may be commonplace for athletes to take time off to preserve a year of eligibility or take a gap year before college, Miller’s choice to drop everything and go on the trip ran counter to expectations.
“There’s a lot of this kind of culture in sports…that you have to act a certain way, maybe listen to a certain type of music, or do certain things, and kind of fit in with the athletes,” he says.
Miller says he is able to resist this temptation to fit in largely because of a time his father pulled him aside after what Miller thought was a good performance at a basketball camp. He remembers his father expressing disappointment because Miller was “fitting in.”
“You don’t [always] fit in in sports, and you don’t have to fit in with everybody else in life,” he recalls his father telling him. “If you have strong beliefs that make you happy, you stick to it.”
The words have stuck with him ever since.
Playing for God is not easy and freeing for everyone, however. For Jewish distance runner Shwayder, who recites the Shema before particularly daunting races, the demands of the sport itself are frequently in conflict with her religious practices. With demanding training and competition schedules as well as religious holidays to observe, conflicts inevitably come up.
In October 2014, one of Shwayder’s races fell on Yom Kippur, the most spiritual day of her year. She was faced with a choice: run, and sacrifice being able to fully commit to the holy day, or participate fully in Yom Kippur and sacrifice being fully committed to her sport.
After much deliberation with her family and her coach, Shwayder chose to compete.
“I decided that these are four very special years to commit myself as much as I can to be the best athlete that I can be,” she says. “And while faith is a huge component of who I am, it is my hope that I will find ways to compromise the balance so that I can still compete at a significant quality.”
That Yom Kippur, Shwayder prayed in her hotel room alone, performing the service she would have otherwise performed at temple with her faith community. She ran, but described the entire experience as “really difficult.” For her, the force of faith during competition time, described as calming for so many other athletes, can become be a source of stress instead, creating a dilemma that cannot be answered simply.
“In some regards, that seems like a choice that I shouldn’t be forced to make,” she says. “But it’s also a reality of the world that we live in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing last weekend’s tournament with a 1-2 mark, the No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team returned home to the Blodgett Pool to host Brown in an Ivy League matchup on Thursday night.
In the first matchup this season against the Bears (17-16, 3-4 Ivy) in the Ivy League tournament, the Crimson (18-10, 5-2 Ivy) fell by one goal. This time, they came away with a tightly contested 7-6 victory at home. The win for Harvard concludes its regular season slate of home games. The squad was able to finish 4-1 overall at the Blodgett this year.
After the home team jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the game, Brown rebounded with three unanswered goals, propelling them ahead midway through the second period. The third came on a Harvard turnover that allowed Bears junior Olivia Santiago free access to the net.
The Crimson was able to rebound, as sophomore attacker Lexi del Toro skipped a shot under the outstretched arm of Bears freshman goalkeeper Marisol Dakan to even the score. Moments later, Harvard sophomore whole set Melissa Balding threw up a last-second shot that hit the mark, giving the home squad a 4-3 halftime lead that it would never relinquish.
In the third quarter, Crimson senior goalie Ariel Dukes did not allow a single shot to pass her, holding Brown scoreless. On the offensive side, both teams struggled and saw their shots deflect off the crossbar on numerous occasions.
Even though both teams suffered penalties that resulted in ejections early on in the frame, neither side could capitalize on its six-on-five advantage.
“Definitely executing on our shots will be one of the main things we focus on next week in practice,” Harvard co-captain Victoria Frager said. “We’ll keep working on inside water shooting and our six-on-five shots.”
Eventually, Harvard was able to extend its lead, as senior attacker Kalina Grabb fired a shot into the net after a cross-pool pass from Frager with 1:56 remaining in the third quarter.
Less than a minute into the fourth quarter, the Crimson again lit up the scoreboard, this time on a goal from sophomore attacker Michelle Martinelli. Only seconds after her penalty shot was turned away, Martinelli was able to earn a tally after her team forced a turnover on the next possession. However, Harvard’s three-goal advantage did not last long, as just 40 seconds later Brown responded with another score from Santiago that cut the lead to two.
With six minutes left in the contest, the Bears again put a ball past the Harvard goaltender, reducing the Crimson’s lead to one. But that was as close as they would get, as Harvard sophomore defender Zoe Osborne buried a shot into the net for the second time on the day. This put Brown at a two-score deficit they were unable to recover from.
Despite another score from the Bears with two minutes to go, Harvard was able to stall by throwing the ball around the pool while the last half minute of play expired.
“I think we missed a lot of shots,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Brown does a very good job of disguising their defense and making it look like we have open shots when we actually don’t.”
Also scoring a goal for the Crimson in the game was junior attacker Yoshi Andersen, who was CWPA’s most recent player of the week. Brown’s additional tallies came on a pair of scores by sophomore Shannon Crowley and a third goal from Santiago, earning her a hat trick in the game.
The seven goals scored is tied for the lowest offensive output for Harvard in a winning game, matching its total in a win over Cal St. Monterey Bay last month.
“It’s gotten to that time of year where you just have to get wins,” Minnis said. “We need to get a couple more to finish out the season strong going into the postseason, so we’re in that ‘win and survive’ mode right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two outs and two on base in the top of the first inning, sophomore infielder Giana Panariello stepped up to the plate and belted one into deep right field. 3-0, Harvard. While the blast seemed like the start of a sweet night, it would turn sour five innings later as the Crimson's early lead turned into a devastating defeat.
“[Senior infielder Katherine] Lantz had an amazing at bat, she went deep in the count, battled her way on base,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “[Senior infielder Emily] Gusse came up with a big hit and then Giana came up with a huge home run for us to put us in the lead.”
Despite the early offense, the Crimson softball team (17-18, 8-4 Ivy) struggled to capitalize throughout the rest of its game at Boston College (17-18, 1-11 ACC). After going up by as much as four, the team simply couldn’t close out the matchup, conceding five runs en route to a 5-4 loss to the Eagles.
“We came out strong. I think we really bounced back from a tough game on Tuesday,” Allard said. “We showed up to play hard. We just gave them too many opportunities and didn’t get them down the stretch.”
The Crimson offense, which leads the Ivy League in both runs and comes in second in hits, continued hitting strong. Harvard outhit the Eagles nine to seven, but in the end couldn’t come out the with win as the Crimson went on to allow three runs in the bottom of the sixth to give up the lead and ultimately the game.
The early offensive success encountered by Harvard drove BC to go to the bull pen early. After giving up three runs, rookie pitcher Allyson Frei was pulled in favor of freshman right hander Jessica Dreswick, who allowed one run over her 4.2 innings of work and earned the win.
“The second pitcher was more of a drop ball pitcher,” Lantz said. “Her ball was just tailing down and I wouldn’t say that was a pitch that we’ve been seeing a lot and I would say that drop ball was really effective for that pitcher.”
The offensive output came early and from the top of the lineup—each of the Crimson’s first three hitters contributed two hits in the contest. The three are all batting above .300 with the lineup as a whole batting .277.
Starting sophomore Taylor Cabe on the mound, Harvard allowed four hits over the first five innings before allowing three in the sixth and letting three score. Cabe would only pitch through the first two innings before being rotated out for junior Morgan Groom and senior Gabrielle Ruiz.
After walking only two over seven innings, Boston College capitalized off Crimson errors, with a fielding error in the third setting up a two run Eagles home run and later conceding three runs after a walk and a steal in the bottom of the sixth.
“We went into a bit off a lull where BC pushed up the offense to take the lead,” Lantz said. “I think we lost that sense of urgency that we had in the first couple innings.”
Although Harvard went deep early, Boston College wouldn’t relent, returning the favor with a two run blast from junior Megan Cooley to put the Eagles within striking distance.
Despite the strong offense, the Crimson couldn’t seem to capitalize off of the hits. Harvard left four stranded, while the Eagles left only two players on the base paths when all was said and done.
Closing out the inning proved to be an issue as well for the Crimson. For a pitching squad with the third lowest ERA in the Ivy League (3.38), the bullpen struggled to close out innings against the home team. Two of the Eagles’ runs came with two outs and all of their runs came with at least one out on the board.
The floodgates opened up in the sixth inning. After walking the first batter of the inning, the Eagles came up with a pair of singles, a bunt, and a sac fly to score three before Harvard could close out the inning.
The Crimson mustered only a single hit in the seventh inning before Boston College was able to retire the side, ending the game and any hope of a last inning comeback.
“That late in the game you can’t walk the first batter,” Allard said. “You can’t walk the leadoff batter. We did that twice in the game. It didn’t hurt us the first time, the second time it hurts."
