After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a gray December afternoon and, in front of the COOP in Harvard Square, rain is falling on hundreds of still, supine forms, splayed out on the road. Passersby, should they want to cross, have to step gingerly between the bodies, nervously walking through the interstitial gaps. This is a “die-in” protest, held to commemorate Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two unarmed black men who were killed by police, and to decry the forces that protesters argue allowed their deaths to go unpunished. Some protesters, recumbent on the concrete, don surgical masks inscribed with the words “I can’t breathe.” Some of them have their eyes closed; others leave theirs open. There’s a strange energy in the air, some odd hybrid of solemn grief and complete fury, brought about by hundreds of people assuming the figures—and, in doing so, some hundredth part of the gravitas—of the dead men who have captured the attention of a nation. It’s hard to look away.
Harvard’s “die-ins” seem to suggest that the “Black Lives Matter” campaign possesses a very real emotional core—and that wellspring of emotion often proves to be a fertile ground for art. The energies that fuel art are similar to the ones that power politico-economic movements, and the line between the two can often blur. The protest can be considered a form of performance art, and movements at Harvard and beyond have utilized the intersection between the two.
In this context, Harvard is in a unique position within the genre of protest-performance art, organizers say. And since Harvard is constantly scrutinized by the media, revolutionary art produced on Harvard’s campus—protest-based or otherwise—has unusual reach and staying power.
PERFORMING PROTESTS
Harvard is familiar with the tradition of performance art as a form of protest. For instance, Divest Harvard, a group that calls for Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies, recently used a tactic that showcases performance art: They initiated the Divest Harvard Fast, a hunger strike in all but name. The hunger strike is an age-old tactic, used by groups ranging from suffragettes to Indian nationalists to Cuban dissidents. The act of fasting has a peculiar evocative power to it: an asceticism that brings up images of emaciated fakirs and a willingness to use the body as a canvas, a la Marina Abramovic.
The Divest Harvard movement, in their quite public fast, was effective in part because it created a strong image, according to organizers. “It’s one action that we did in an arsenal of a lot of other really effective actions,” says Talia K. Rothstein ’17, co-coordinator of the Divest Harvard movement. “But I think it really did help to incorporate an image of us…that did stick, that image of us fasting.”
The symbolic value of the enterprise is immense—according to Rothstein, there’s something very powerful, from an artistic standpoint, about using the physicality of the body to convey a distinct message or sentiment. “Any time you put your body in a certain state with fasting—but for me even more powerfully with protest—you’re putting your body literally in a spot, and doing something with your body to say: ‘I am protesting through this physical act,’” Rothstein says. “By sitting somewhere, you’re saying, ‘I am sitting here because I believe I have to be here until something changes, until there’s justice.”
SYMBOLS
According to Fadhal A. Moore ’14, a prominent member of the Harvard Black Men’s Forum and organizer of a December protest of the Ferguson decision, art can strengthen movements by creating a distinct aesthetic imprint—a certain “vibe”—that can attach concrete images to the potentially hazy issues at a movement’s core. “I think imagery can serve as a uniting force—something that a lot of people can get behind,” he says. “Art unites us and gives us a common purpose. When art becomes the main focus, the meaning behind the protest becomes emphasized, instead of a specific person or event.”
This phenomenon has its roots in history, according to History professor Mary D. Lewis. In an interview, Lewis talks about France’s storied May 1968 revolutions to discuss the intertwined relationship between art and a movement’s iconography. According to Lewis, the protests came to be associated with a distinct set of posters made by French art collective Atelier Populaire. “Those images probably played a galvanizing role. It was kind of a social media thing, in a way,” Lewis says. “The posters try and make those connections.”
One poster that played a significant role in the movement bore a stylized navy-and-white image of protester Daniel Cohn-Bendit laughing in the face of a riot policeman with the caption “Nous Sommes Tous Indésirables,” or “We are all undesirables,” positioned under it. “I think an image like that, of Daniel Cohn-Bendit laughing in the face of the riot police, is potentially very powerful for people who are trying to think about this in broader terms,” Lewis says. According to Lewis, when several cartoonists at French publication Charlie Hebdo were assassinated this winter the support movement for the humor magazine rallied under the phrase “Nous Sommes Tous Charlie”, or “We are all Charlie,”—a direct callback to the 1968 protests, Tapping into the distinctive iconography of the May 1968 events recalls the ideas associated with that protests—independence, free-thought, and irreverence in the face of censorship—and placed them in the context of the Charlie Hebdo situation.
Similarly, the “Black Lives Matter” protests have developed their own distinctive icons and symbols—the “die-ins,” a hands-up gesture meant to communicate the “Hands up, don’t shoot” message, the surgical masks with the words “I can’t breathe” scrawled across the mouths. Even the slogan “Black Lives Matter” has a certain poetry to it. As Moore suggests, a distinct artistic flavor can help validate a movement by relating it to larger, more pervasive issues.
According to Sarah F. Cole ‘16, protester and president of the Black Students Assocation, the use of distinct iconography propelled the movement at Harvard by viscerally connecting it to the larger, national movement. “You share about the die-ins, you share about the highways being shut down, different places being shut down—even just the term ‘shut it down’—you share in all these key characteristics that really tie the movement together,” Cole says. “It makes you feel like we’re a part of something much greater than just Harvard’s campus or Boston.” Mutual participation in the creation of revolutionary art can also promote solidarity in the participants of a movement. Rothstein notes that simultaneous fasting also served to bring the Divest members closer together. “The hunger was a thing that all of us had in common that day, as well as in common with people actually suffering from [hunger],” she says. “It was a very strong community-builder for our group.”
ARTISTIC PASSION
Unlike political rhetoric, the unique emotional aspects of revolutionary art enable it to be an effective form a protest, according to some protesters. “Art has the power to take you out of you current consciousness into someplace else,” says Paige R. Woods ’16, the assistant director and script editor for theater production and social media campaign “I, Too, Am Harvard.” “And it really has the power to instruct your line of thinking, to challenge you in a way that gets you thinking.”
More specifically, Cole notes that the particular “die-in” demonstration is powerful as it consciously uses powerful images and symbols to trigger responses. “[The form is] very effective because it gives people who wouldn’t normally encounter this issue a visual of what is happening, a visual of how this issue of police brutality is affecting communities,” she says. The group performance that is the “die-in” protest attempts to make a distinct emotional imprint on the spectator in a way that other communicative forms cannot.
It’s difficult to ignore the intense emotionality of the protests. “We’ve seen so much of these campaigns being centered around art because it is one of those few things that can make you stop, that can help distance us from the violence we see on a day-to-day basis,” Woods says. “Art can make us think about [our lives]. It can take us out of what we view as our reality into someplace else. Or, conversely, it can make us very very aware of our reality and the issues pertaining to it. That’s why it’s so popular, why so many movements are using it—it’s a form of therapy, a way of dealing with what’s going on.”
HARVARD PROTESTS
Harvard’s position in the protest-performance art scene is a unique one—according to Cole, Harvard’s visibility places it and its movements in the public eye. “Harvard does have that distinction, and people do listen, and people just look when we do things,” Cole says. The “I, Too, Am Harvard” movement, a photo campaign addressing black students’ experiences at Harvard spearheaded by Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, is a prime example of Harvard students’ capacity for creating revolutionary art that many students found meaningful. Initiated to promote her show of the same name, the photo campaign, as well as its distinctive photographic style, that captured students holding up statements on dry-erase boards, has become iconic. Variations on its eponymous slogan have also started to spread—“I, Too, Am Stanford”, “I, Too, Am Oxford”, “I, Too, Am Berkeley” have become rallying cries for students of color on other campuses.
Beyond the success of “I, Too, Am Harvard,” however, Cole believes that Harvard cannot see itself as the only agent of change. “I don’t believe that Harvard students, or even Harvard professors, are going to be able to swoop in and save the day at all,” she says. “What I do think Harvard has the power to do, has the responsibility to do, is provide a foundation and a platform from which those individuals can raise their voices.”
Woods echoes Cole’s sentiment. “We shouldn’t try to come from the outside in these situations and take control. I don’t think that’s it,” Woods says. “But it’s just a matter of fact that once Harvard’s name is placed on something there’s more media attention. The public eye is on us, and that can be good. There’s a way of being strategic about that.”
Furthermore, Cole stresses that Harvard should use its publicity to aid the fellow branches of larger movements. “I really see our role at the institution of Harvard as being a supportive role, and I think that’s what’s going to be most beneficial,” she says. In fact, the “Black Lives Matter” movement, as well as the Divest Harvard campaign, don’t have their roots here on campus, but are branches of larger movements—local expressions of larger, national patterns.
BEYOND THE MOMENT
In talking about large, pervasive protest movements, it’s easy to lose track of their effects on individual participants and spectators. Amanda D. Bradley ’15, a veteran protester and former president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, writes of her experience in an email. “During one of the protests I helped to plan in reaction to Darren Wilson's non-indictment, some Kuumba members sang while other students participated in a die-in. As I lay on the concrete as rain poured on me, I felt sadness for the first time. I'd felt sad before about the Michael Brown case, but most of it was anger. But that day, I cried as they sang.”
On that grey afternoon, the hundreds of protesters’ bodies created a tableau—a true piece of ephemeral performance art. The minutes passed, and the protesters got up, and continued on with their demonstrations—and, at the end of the day, continued on with their lives. But perhaps some spectators—random passers-by going about their day—were left with a visceral image of the stillness of death, the suffering of a people. For them, the deaths of Brown and Garner were more than another article in a paper.

If one can get over the awkward title and Kevin Costner’s near growl of a voice, there’s a lot to like about “Black or White.” It has a solid cast and appreciable frankness, and it authentically attempts to tackle issues of race in a personal and understanding way. But “Black or White,” written and directed by Mike Binder and funded by Costner, pairs this genuine humanism with a multitude of storylines and archetypal Hollywood elements, and the film ultimately suffers.
The film opens on Elliot Anderson (Costner), a wealthy Southern California lawyer whose gruffness belies a deep anguish, in a hospital waiting room. Still reeling from the unexpected death of his 17-year-old daughter in childbirth, Elliot has just lost his beloved wife, Carol (Jennifer Ehle), in a car accident. While the film makes it abundantly clear that Elliot is not handling her death well—Costner probably spends the majority of his screen time holding a bottle of liquor—it also underlines his efforts as he tries to raise his biracial granddaughter, Eloise (Jillian Estell), who is eight years old at the time of the story. Despite his boozing and inability to comb Eloise’s hair, Elliot feels justified in his right to raise Eloise, a right called into question by the indomitable matriarchal force that is Rowena Jeffers (Octavia Spencer), who wishes to raise Eloise on her own.
“Black or White” is buoyed by strong performances, but for all of the film’s intent to show the human elements in racial prejudice, many of the characters veer too close to stereotypes. When Mackie’s character puts his passion to use in the trial, his consistent sharp tone and self-centeredness feel artificial. Even worse is Duvan (Mpho Koaho), the precocious West African math tutor Elliot finds on Craigslist, whose extreme earnestness marks his character as a clear ploy to get laughs rather than a real dramatic agent. Luckily for Binder and for the audience, Costner does a stellar job at portraying the many facets of Elliot’s struggle with grief. Octavia Spencer’s laser-like eyes and soulful presence particularly stand out, animating every scene.
Though Binder imbues the ensuing family drama with plenty of heart, “Black or White” struggles mainly because it does not know quite which film it wants to be. On the one hand, it’s a story of a tense but tight grandfather-granddaughter relationship that rightfully bears witness to Elliot’s pain and his often pathetic attempts to deal with it. But this storyline is largely abandoned about halfway through in favor of Reggie’s—whose portrayal by Holland barely saves the character from being a damaging stereotype—and his effect on a bitter Elliot. Reggie’s return to Eloise’s life brings up resentment and disappointment from all sides, which serves to flesh out the characters’ backgrounds but does not advance the point of the story.
Then again, the point of the film is never clear . For all of the film’s boldness in addressing issues of race in a personal setting, any real message is obscured by an ending steeped in Hollywood mawkishness and cliché.The film has strong scenes, but these moments don’t get the deeply personal ending they deserve. To be sure, “Black and White” does much with its fraught material and is sincere in its efforts to explore the dynamics of this family struggle without judgement. But its reckoning of race is ultimately mere academic discussion, burdened by a few vague characters and occasional discomfort. The real message seems to be that people are just people who can love, mess up, and maybe forgive—but no one needs a film to know that.

Acting, no matter how good, cannot overcome the fundamental incoherence of a play. This is manifest in the American Repertory Theater’s production of “Father Comes Home from the Wars,” written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks and directed by Jo Bonney. Despite some truly excellent performances on the part of the cast, the show ultimately fails to unify individual moments into a dramatic whole.
The play’s putative protagonist, Hero (Benton Greene), is a slave belonging to a Confederate colonel. In the first act, he faces the choice to stay on the plantation, go to war with his master (Ken Marks)--who has promised him freedom for service--or a third, most dangerous option: to run away and begin an uncertain life of freedom on his own terms. The general arc of the story is meant to reflect the “Odyssey,” but in practice this relationship is extremely attenuated and creates the single greatest occasion of confusion in this play. Like Odysseus, Hero leaves a war and comes home; other parallels, however, are not subverted so much as made awkward. While Hero is like Odysseus in that he is not faithful to his common-law wife, Penny (Jenny Jules), during his travels, he does not leave his mistress from abroad but rather marries her and brings her home, vitiating the poignancy of the Ithacan’s ultimate loyalty. On the other hand, Penny has not for her part been faithful, and is in fact bearing the child of another slave, Homer (Sekou Laidlow). Her loyalty is limited to refusing to kiss Homer, which makes something of a farce of Penelope’s faithfulness.
Indeed, there are few premises for these parallels that hold up well: while Odysseus is a king, it is unclear in the play why Hero is such an object of admiration and respect for the other slaves on the plantation. Homer’s name seems to be an almost deliberate affront to the audience, as his character has practically nothing to do with the archetypal poet. All in all, this entire central artistic premise serves more to confuse than anything else. The text’s penchant for melodrama and heavy-handed political metaphor does nothing to redeem the actual content of the play.
This state of affairs is a shame, since much of the acting showcased in “Father Comes Home” is superb. Particularly outstanding is Jacob Ming-Trent’s comic work in the third act as the speaking “Odyssey-Dog,” Hero’s canine companion. His delivery manages both to be frenzied and to be completely clear, a rare feat; his body language is strange and fantastical but exactly what one would expect from a dog in a man’s body. His performance provides a welcome touch of humor and whimsy to a third act that is otherwise overwrought. Yet the character itself is perhaps a misstep on the part of the playwright, since until its appearance there is no hint of the surreal or fantastic in the play, and the arrival of the Odyssey-Dog is somewhat discordant as a result. Another strong performance was that of Greene, who puts on a brave face as Hero, a character who is generally not especially sympathetic. He manages to eke from the text some genuinely touching moments, particularly in the first act, as he agonizes between leaving Penny and obeying his imagined call to greatness.
While the Civil War is a historical event with rich potential for dramatic treatments, especially those that draw on the tradition of classical tragedy, “Father Comes Home from the Wars” sadly falls short of the mark. In spite of some excellent acting and occasional moments of true pathos, artistic incoherence takes the day.

Jocelyn L. Arndt ’17 and Christian S. Arndt ’18 are reminiscent of the Disney Channel heroine Hannah Montana: students by day, rockstars by night. As singer-pianist and guitarist, respectively, of their own band, the siblings juggle school and touring and even carved out the time to release their first EP, “Strangers in Fairyland,” in October. Following their recent return from the Sundance Film Festival, the indie blues rockers sat down with The Crimson to talk musical beginnings, touring, and their experience playing at the largest independent film festival in America.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get first involved in music?
Jocelyn L. Arndt: I used to take tap dance lessons in kindergarten and I was awful.… Then I was like, “Mom, I want to take piano lessons. I’m not good at dancing.” … So I started piano in fourth grade.
Christian S. Arndt: I kept telling my parents that if she’s going to learn piano, I want to learn piano. They didn’t want us to learn the same instrument because they didn’t want any sibling competition, so Dad basically just gave me a guitar and said, “Here’s this. Learn this.” And it worked out pretty well.
JLA: [We started making music together] not very long after that. We started playing talent shows. We did a local talent show where we played “Stairway to Heaven,” and that was our first big rock song.… And then we started writing music in high school.
CSA: I think I was in 8th grade, and we were just like, “Oh, let’s write a song.” And we kind of said that for a couple months. Finally, I sat down and came up with like a rhythm pattern.… I think I tried to write some [lyrics], but they were pretty bad because I’m not really a lyricist. So Jocelyn was like, “Yeah, I’m singing. I get to choose what I sing.”
THC: What’s your daily schedule like with music and school? Do you practice every day?
CSA: Probably not as much as we should. Last semester was my first semester—I was just getting used to college last semester, which is an experience in and of itself. My time management skills have improved greatly, so this semester hopefully I’ll have more time to practice.
THC: What’s the best thing about working with your sibling?
CSA: The access. If we’re at home and one of us is up at 4 a.m. and has a brilliant idea for a song, we can write it down. And the next morning, when it’s still in our heads, we can start working on it.
JLA: My best thing is that we know each other very well, so we don’t take each other too seriously. Like when I start going off the handle diva style, Chris reins me in, and vice-versa if he’s taking 45 minutes to do his hair.
THC: What was the most exciting thing about Sundance?
JLA: We didn’t get to go to any screenings, but we saw Nicole Kidman. Well, I didn’t really see her. I saw a flurry of bodyguards around her.
CSA: Yeah, there was a flash of blonde hair and a bunch of big, burly dudes.… The artists were pretty cool too.… One of the former members of Stone Temple Pilots formed a band, and they played there. And one of the former members of Weezer formed a band, and they played there.
THC: What are your post-graduate plans?
JLA: We’ll see where the music thing goes. We’re pushing pretty hard for this. We’re looking at another album this summer and a pretty extensive tour.… We’re just going to keep playing, and it should be really fun.
CSA: That’s what we’re going to do for as long as it’s a fruit-bearing tree.

It’s not every day that a favorite childhood story is brought to life with a full orchestra, soaring arias, sumptuous costumes, and even a giant gingerbread house. Yet Harvard College Opera’s production of “Hansel and Gretel,” directed by Olivia M. Munk ’16, promises exactly this. The three-act retelling of the classic fairy tale runs Feb. 4-8 at the Agassiz Theater.
While “Hansel and Gretel,” composed in the 1890s by Engelbert Humperdinck, was originally performed in German, this production will use an English libretto. Music director Maxwell P. Phillips ’15 believes this change will make the opera accessible to a wide range of audience members. “Hansel and Gretel is a traditional Märchenoper, a German genre of fairy-tale opera for children,” says Phillips. “[It's] charming, fun, full of great music—and fantastic for people who don’t have much experience with opera.”
The cast is confident that “Hansel and Gretel” will also appeal to the viewers’ nostalgic sensibilities. “All my blockmates are really excited to see it because they’re already familiar with the tale,” says Charlotte L. McKechnie ’15, who plays Hansel. Despite the story’s familiarity, McKechnie thinks that audiences are in for a surprise. "There are enough twists embedded in the opera that you will feel like you are experiencing [Hansel and Gretel] for the first time,” says McKechnie.
Indeed, one of the strengths of “Hansel and Gretel” is its compelling three-dimensionality, one which both enables the opera to transcend its frame of a traditional child’s tale and, according to producer Christina A. Bianco ’17 (who also plays Gertrud, Hansel and Gretel’s mother), to exceed the audience’s expectations. “The nice thing about the opera is that it’s a traditionally longer art form than say, the quick prose of a children’s tale, which provides the opportunity for greater character development,” says Bianco. “I’m only playing the mother, but I’m there on stage for a good half hour, and you get to see that her reasons for sending off her children are complex and not necessarily ‘evil.’”
According to McKechnie, another major source of nuance in the opera is the music. “It’s written for a big orchestra and has a lush, Wagnerian score that’s very good at reflecting the fire and energy of the opera,” she says. “The strong music reflects just how resilient these children are in the midst of hardship.”
The opera’s visuals promise to be just as alluring. “They’ve really got the choreography down,” says producer Sam R. Reynolds ’16. “It’s not easy to act like genuine children, but our Hansel and Gretel (Claudia D. Oh ’17) have mastered it. They’ve got that twinkle in their eye and that childish enthusiasm, like they’re experiencing the world for the first time.”
Reynolds believes that the set design will also stand out to audiences. “Our giant gingerbread house is just spectacular. Its larger-than-life candies are so convincing,” he says. “You’ve really got to see it to believe it, though you might start drooling when you see the actors eat some on stage.” Not that the audience has been neglected in this respect: after the matinee performance on Sunday, Feb. 8, audiences are invited to attend a reception with milk and cookies.

Four students meet up, drop their backpacks, and settle into the Canaday Common Room after a busy day of navigating the slush and attending classes. From the outside, one might imagine that they are hunkering down for an evening of problem sets and class presentations. But this is no study group. Instead, the students comprise the small cast and crew working on Brendan Gall’s “A Quiet Place.” The play, which will run from Feb. 6 to 8 in Canaday B-12, centers around David (Nicolas E. O’Connor ’17) and Henry (Thomas W. Peterson ’18), two men who are trapped in a black box theater without any idea of how they arrived there.
“The play explores what happens when two humans are placed together when stripped of qualities that we might think are necessary for humans to live, such as eating or going to work, having a family, having an environment,” director Samuel A. Hagen ’18 says. “All there is is the black space and a chair.” Serendipitously, Hagen lives in Canaday B-12, a dorm room that previously housed playwright and producer Randy Weiner ’87 of American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) fame. In fact, Hagen says that a 1983 production of Jean-Paul Sartre's "Huis Clos" ("No Exit"), directed by Weiner and his roommate in Canaday B-12, inspired his staging of “A Quiet Place.”
“I knew I wanted to do something with theater in alternate spaces,” Hagen says. “So by happenstance at some point during the semester, I Googled Canaday B-12 to see if there was anything online about our room, and I found the article [about “Huis Clos”].”
“A Quiet Place” promises to be especially compelling for its use of space (or the lack of it). In the room, an 8 x 4 foot “stage” forces the actors to restrain their motions and promotes a feeling of claustrophobia. Since the play focuses on the power dynamics between David and Henry, forcing the two into a small space makes the tensions rise rather quickly, according to the cast. “I think the show really sells itself because of the space,” producer Gita C. Abhiraman ’18 says. “People want to know, ‘Oh, how are these people going to put on a play in a Canaday room?’ Because everyone knows that Canaday is cramped.”
Indeed, the production staff advises people who “are easily frightened or subject to claustrophobia” to skip the show, according to a note on the Facebook invite. “It should be really intense, moving, frightening maybe at times,” Abhiraman says. “Overall, I think it’s an example of how art can be pulled out of its usual environment, and I think sometimes when you make people uncomfortable, it can generate something rather special.”

"I’ve memorized this all already," conductor Vance George says of the choral conducting book open in front of him in the Harvard Loeb Music Library.
The fact isn’t surprising, given that George led the San Francisco Symphony Chorus to four Grammy awards in the 23 years he served as their conductor. During his visit to Harvard for a residency from Jan. 27 to Jan. 30, George lead the Holden Choruses in a rehearsal of three different works by Johannes Brahms. "It’s just great to work with wonderful, bright, interested, engaged students who are learning these wonderful pieces by Bach and Brahms," George says.
Conducting the Holden Choruses was no small feat, given that the students did not spend much time rehearsing the pieces before meeting George. But he welcomed any level of preparation. "It’s like working with something that’s alive, and you start where you find them and build on that. It’s not unlike cooking...you put [the ingredients] together and fashion them into something delicious," he says.
Yet he approached working with students much the same way that he would with seasoned professionals. "I was amazed at the alacrity and the handle they had on the music and also on the text," he says. "I’m basically bringing the music up off the page into their being, so that they can then impart that to the audience."
In order to foster this element of communication with the audience, George focused heavily on the emotional aspects of the performance during his rehearsal with the Holden Choruses—a pleasant surprise for the participants. Silvia Golumbeanu ’17, a member of Radcliffe Choral Society, describes a moment when George made a provocative comment that changed the mood in the room. "You could see everybody becoming really thoughtful [as he said], ‘I want everyone to think about this song...as if you’re dedicating it to someone else.’"
Fellow RCS member Nareen N. Manoukian, a first-year student at the Graduate School of Education, agrees that George’s focus on emotion and connection was unique. "Someone who is that accomplished...you’d think there’d be an emphasis on accuracy...but I was really surprised by his broad approach and his emphasis on connection to the music," she said.
George has been praised for his distinctive style of conducting and emotional manner of teaching. "They are redemptive," George says. "They have incredible texts and musical expression that reaches deep into the soul and is deeply moving to bring you to your best self. I think great art...lead[s] us to experience our best selves—our deepest self."
This philosophy translates to a technical appreciation of the pieces, too—one that emphasizes the most minute details. According to Harvard Glee Club Publicity Manager Connor A. Horton ’18, George worked on perfecting German pronunciation. "You think with singing you need to minimize the consonants to make it beautiful, but he made us really emphasize [them]," Horton says.
The students ultimately found George’s distinctive views fulfilling. "It was nice to get a fresh perspective in terms of interpretation...and to get a sense of what you sound [like] to a third party," says Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum Manager Lauren E. Goff ’16.
For George, it is reactions such as those from the Holden Choruses members that make teaching such a valued part of his discipline, as he views music not only as art but also as a crucial part of education and development. "I think when people leave a concert they are better human beings, and certainly the performers have gone inside that inner being and explored what the composer has put down on the page that was deeply moving to him or her," he says.
George believes that music can also serve as a powerful vehicle for social change. "It’s social change through music, social change through art," George says. "Going into an area where there are underprivileged children and having them experience music and art and dance and orchestra and band and so forth."
The mission is one he intends to advance himself. Asked what he plans to do after his Harvard residency, he answers without hesitation: "Running around various parts of the country and the world and working with choirs...continuing to make a difference in the world through art."

For all its merits, it is unfortunate that “The Sculptor,” Scott McCloud’s first foray into adult graphic novel writing, is less than satisfying. McCloud is justly renowned for his nonfiction works about comics—“Understanding Comics,” “Reinventing Comics,” and “Making Comics”—which are themselves so cleverly written in comic book form that they are likely to make readers wish theory on every subject were illustrated by McCloud. As one would expect from such works, and from its author’s background as a popularizer of comics theory, “The Sculptor” shines on a panel-to-panel level. Yet while it demonstrates much technical skill, it ultimately falls short as a work of fiction. McCloud’s evident desire to convey complex insights is commendable. However, the embodiment of these insights remains disappointingly basic, and McCloud’s strengths as an explainer of theory become his weaknesses in this new context of storytelling.
The overarching narrative and its protagonist suffer from an excess of purity and a lack of complexity. In the novel, young, washed-up sculptor David Smith makes a deal with Death: unlimited power to sculpt any material with his hands, but only 200 days to use the power before he dies. David is a perfectionist and sentimental to the point of being at times annoying. He has made 36 promises to himself and to others, ranging from not shopping at D’Agostino to not telling Meg, the recently discovered love of his life, that he loves her. And, as his best friend Ollie puts it, “David refuses to believe he lives in a random uncaring universe.” There are few moments that have the potential to offer a deeper understanding of why he has these traits or his unique manifestations of them. The reader glimpses into his past, in which David’s family members passed away one by one, but the essence of these relationships and the effect of their loss lack depth and nuance.
That being said, though the book’s characters are only superficially defined, they are tenderly flawed in a way that suggests McCloud’s sensitivity. He treats David’s sexual inexperience, for example, not as a gimmick but as an expression of his perfectionism, though the issue is only briefly grazed. McCloud’s gentleness with his characters is particularly evident in Meg and Ollie, whom he is careful to flesh out. Meg isn’t just the love interest and Ollie isn’t only the best friend; they each have problems of their own. Ollie and his boyfriend take advantage of each other, and Meg has mood swings and abandonment anxiety. Nonetheless, the reader’s windows into these complex psychologies remain foggy, and scenes tend to take a turn for the cheesy when David is there.
Aside from a sparse smattering of deep moments from Meg, Ollie, and occasionally David, the insights the book has to offer are for the most part rudimentary. “If [my art] was all worthless... how would I ever really know?” David laments to his friend Ollie. “Relax…Nobody ‘knows’ anything,” Ollie replies. This struggle with the impossible search for absolute truth and validation is an interesting start, but it’s packaged and presented to readers as simple exposition. It is exactly what Scott McCloud does so well on the close-up level—showing and not telling—that is missing from the big-picture narrative.
Some areas that McCloud begins to explore dissolve into the ether as the book goes on. For example, the novel seems to be concerned with one of the art world’s ongoing discussions: the question of irony versus sincerity. David’s friend Ollie, who works for a gallery, says jokingly that David has an “irony deficiency” and tries to tell him that the critics and collectors won’t understand his art, meaningful though it is to David himself, and that they “want to see a focused, coherent, singular vision.” The artwork of David’s that the reader sees is indeed sentimental. Each work represents a memory—of his sister who’s passed away, “Beth Dudek’s tube top,” or his first wet dream. David’s work, saturated with self-expression and technical mastery, hardly seems to belong in the postmodern era. But this issue loses traction almost as soon as it begins to develop. David is strangely untroubled when his newfound power makes sculpting effortless, and the matter is consequently dropped.
“The Sculptor” is most successful at close-range storytelling. When David gets drunk, for example, McCloud depicts the scene with pictures that don’t quite fit in their panels, in panels that don’t quite fit on the page. He represents David’s experience only visually—and with a dose of cleverness to boot. Later David, afraid of his Russian landlord, hides when he hears two pedestrians speaking Russian. In the first panel the speech bubbles are filled with Russian text, but in the next panel McCloud has provided translations in brackets: the couple is talking harmlessly about party invitations. The gesture is charming, a little joke to the readers, and exemplifies McCloud’s fluency in the language of comics.
“The Sculptor” may just be the case of an intelligent, creative author who is only beginning to delve into a new genre. While it is likely to be a disappointment for some of McCloud’s fans, this is not to say the book bodes entirely poorly for McCloud’s future endeavors as a graphic novelist. “The Sculptor” demonstrates that Scott McCloud is full of good intentions and is talented at translating real-life situations and interactions into comic book scenes.

"I’m sorry. The lecture is completely sold out," a museum representative said.
"Sold out! I thought the event was free!" a disappointed prospective attendee responded.
Last Thursday, at the Harvard Art Museums, senior curator Jodi Hauptman and senior conservator Karl Buchberg of the Museum of Modern Art in New York spoke about their most recent project, "Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs," an exhibit that opened in October and closes in two weeks.
Comprised of about 100 cut-outs, Hauptman’s and Buchberg’s exhibit focuses on Matisse’s "The Swimming Pool" (1952), a piece of art which displays a novel style for its time due to its medium. According to Hauptman, based on Buchberg’s and his historical research, photographs of the artist’s work show that he first envisioned a scene—as sketched at various points—and then put scissor to paper and cut out his images. Pins were then used to piece together the cut-outs in the chosen design. For the exhibit, Hauptman and Buchberg studied both the final display and the process of creation. "Deep knowledge of materials and techniques is essential for understanding modernism," Hauptman said.
With his perspective as a conservator, Buchberg analyzed how the materials, particularly the cut-outs, influenced the art’s display. For instance, in "The Swimming Pool," the height of the display changes how much beige (from the burlap material), white, or blue is shown. When the height was changed from 11 to seven feet, there was more beige above than below the white parts of the cut-out. This presentation crucially changes the way museum-goers see the work on the walls. "MoMA only once tried to hang the panels at the right height…. It was too low," Bucherberg said.
Historical research played a large role in the creation of this installation. In response to a question regarding the historical interpretation she and Buchberg took, Hauptman explained that the artist’s own documentation demonstrates the usefulness analyzing the past to understand how to best display the art. "Matisse’s constant photographing of his own work tells us that there are many stages [of production], but I don’t think that anything is left out."
Attendee Narayan Khandekar, director of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies for the Harvard Art Museums, thought that the historical focus helped audience members experience the exhibit from over 50 years ago in a way that was authentic to the artist’s original intention. "I think it is great to see how an environment is recreated," he says. "It gives you an insight as to how to experience these spaces." Attendee Liza Leto-Fulton agrees. "For me I think the intriguing part of the lecture today was…solving problems as to how to reinstall it...once it was taken from its original site [and] how to sort of recreate the feeling in a completely different environment."
While dealing with the challenge of displaying Matisse’s work, Hauptman and Buchberg showed that a joint curator and conservator perspective can be useful when one cannot simply re-hang a painting. "I think this is another example of how you need not just one point of view, but you need all these different perspectives to come together to give you the possibility of an audience decades later experiencing an artist’s created space," Khandekar says. "Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs" is not the first joint-venture between curators and conservators, and due to these collaborative efforts, an ample showing of audience appreciation continues as the exhibit enjoys its last weeks of display.

“There have been two ways to look at things like minstrelsy. One way is to say: ‘Let’s forget it and look forward,’ and the other way is to say: ‘We will never forget,’” Louis Chude-Sokei said at the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library on Jan 26. Author of “The Last 'Darky': Bert Williams, Black-on-Black Minstrelsy, and the African Diaspora,” Chude-Sokei was the keynote speaker at the opening of the exhibit “Unmasking Jim Crow: Blackface Minstrelsy in American Pop Culture.” Consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, blackface minstrelsy was hugely popular in 19th-century America and was viewed as one of the first US cultural exports, spreading to Australia, France, South Africa, and even China. Today, however, minstrelsy is largely ignored as an embarrassing and inconvenient page of American history.
Last semester, Carol J. Oja, William Powell Mason Professor of Music, and Samuel J. Parler, Ph.D candidate in Music, started a seminar entitled “Blackface Minstrelsy in 19th Century America” to explore the history and legacy of blackface performance. The class culminated in the student-curated exhibit “Unmasking Jim Crow,” currently on display Jan. 26 through May 8 on the second floor of the Loeb Music Library. The exhibit includes images, sheet music, songsters, and other artifacts from the Harvard Theater Collection, which has one of the most important compilations of 19th century minstrelsy materials in the world.
At the opening symposium, Chude-Sokei and Rhiannon Giddens, banjoist and vocalist of Grammy award-winning old-time string band “The Carolina Chocolate Drops,” shared their understanding of minstrelsy. Chude-Sokei discussed the role that minstrelsy played in legitimizing slavery and shaping the stereotype of black people around the world. Yet, as he explained, minstrel shows later became very popular among African Americans and had an influx of black performers after the Civil War. “For black [performers] who did it, it was their way to have access to the stage of performance,” Chude-Sokei said. “It was them trying to prove they could [also perform minstrelsy] because it was so popular and it was celebrated as a great important international thing. So black people wanted to show that ‘we can do it too’, which sounds bizarre.” He emphasized that the audience has to understand minstrelsy in its historical context. “Even though we think of it as a racist performance, back then many black people liked it. They thought it was funny...because they were like, ‘Look at how stupid white people made themselves look.’”
Giddens talked about the huge influence that historical musicologists, including Chude-Sokei, had on her and her work and the collaboration between scholars and performers in spreading the awareness of black history. “After I read the books that these scholars have written, I can then perform for somebody who probably would never read the book and give them a little bit information about this,” she said. “So it does take everybody to get the information out there and to get this music and this part of history.”
For students in the seminar, the study was rewarding and refreshing. Grace Edgar, Ph.D candidate in Historical Musicology, thinks it is important to examine minstrelsy because a lot of its influence and stereotypes survive in this age. “Especially today, with the Ferguson issue, we need to think about the image that we have produced,” she said.
“Unmasking Jim Crow” is ultimately the culmination of the lessons discovered in Oja’s and Parler’s seminar—one that will continue to advocate deeper perspectives. “[The seminar] has turned out even better than I could imagine,” Parler said. “Teaching the class, we’ve had a really great opportunity to get collections in the library. I think all students have really learned a lot and are now thinking about [minstrelsy] in their own way.”

America’s unreflective dismissal of Ebonics is rather fascinating, not because many see it as a “lesser” form of English, but rather because society fails, for the most part, to dip its feet into the deeper end of the issue and actually understand what Ebonics really is.
During the slave trade, members of many different tribes were put together on the same vessel. They were of vastly different cultures, so in order to communicate with each other (and also with their English-speaking slave masters of the American South), they created their own Creole. Eventually their children adapted this Creole such that it developed its own grammar, turning into a quasi-language.
Obviously, the story above is simplified. But it’s the version that most of us hear and come to believe.
But let’s look at it through a more intellectual lens.
Language, both as a method of communication and a cultural symbol, influences and contributes to how people understand the world around them. More specifically, it shapes the way people come across information and knowledge, affecting how they interpret it.
Psycholinguist Frantz Fanon once asserted that to speak a language is to assume its culture. In order to understand a language, its speakers, and its character, one needs to understand its cultural codes. And it is precisely the understanding of this idea, or lack thereof, which contributes to the misperception of Ebonics and Ebonics speakers. Fanon’s idea is one of the reasons why tonal languages such as Mandarin or Punjabi are difficult for non-native speakers to master: Different tones convey different meanings, are used in different societal contexts, and often are attached to cultural values. It’s also why the Inuit tribe of Northern Canada has around 50 words for the word “snow.”
One of Ebonics’ most distinguishing features is its oral expression, as its parent languages belong to the Niger-Congo language family of West Africa. With that in mind, one begins to understand why rap, hip-hop, and other forms of black expression are so rich with clever wordplay, imaginative language, metaphors, and linguistic aestheticisms.
When Ebonics-speaking students are discouraged and told that their language, which they usually have spoken their entire lives, is inferior or wrong, the blame somehow falls on the child for speaking it. It creates resentment and inferiority complexes. The trend that arises from this is a wide achievement gap between Ebonics-speaking students and Standard English-speaking students. But on the other hand, Ebonics-speaking students who don’t perform well on written tests actually do very well on more verbal assessments. The reason goes back to the highly oral nature of Ebonics.
In the United States, standardized writing is the formal method of communication. So, society’s power structure may prevent more oral-natured languages to be held in the same light. In other words, Ebonics is devalued because American society values written skills more so than oral ones. Of course, this is not always the case, but if a person wants to make a reasonable living in this society, knowing how to write is a must. This preference given to writing pokes at the Foucaultian notion of “regimes of truth,” or the idea that power legitimizes a set of beliefs. Because those in power deem Standard English the formal language of discourse, others are considered inferior, or simply wrong.
In the end, the Ebonics stereotype persists: “You are probably ignorant if you speak it.” But again, the de-legitimization and ridicule of Ebonics, if one looks deeply enough, lacks any reasonable foundation. It is the general ignorance of people and the preference of those in power that keeps a more positive outlook of Ebonics at bay. Ridiculing Ebonics is ridiculing the culture that it represents. America talks about moving away from racial gaps, but as long as cultural disparities and imbalances—like those of language—exist, progress will be slow.
Learning Standard English is nearly essential to success in American business. And having a common language form definitely helps unify and standardize discourse in a country so diverse as the United States. But it wouldn’t hurt to let Ebonics-speaking students know that Ebonics isn’t bad and that Standard English isn’t better, and rather that they should simply be used in different contexts. Like members of an immigrant family who must learn English to secure jobs but who enjoy speaking Spanish at home, Ebonics-speakers can see prudential reasons for learning Standard English without appreciating their own dialect. Using Ebonics through linguistic code-switching (or using language based on cultural context) may just be the next step to give Ebonics more weight as a legitimate dialect of American English, and not an inferior form of speaking.

I am a feminist. I believe in the equality of the sexes. For me, feminism means freedom: freedom to dress the way I want, freedom to choose whether or not to get pregnant, freedom to say no to unwanted sexual interaction, freedom to have as many sexual partners as I want without being looked down on, freedom to be an engineer or lawyer or nurse or stay-at-home mom—basically, freedom to live my life.
But I do not believe in female empowerment.
The founder of Nerd Girls, a female empowerment movement, came to speak at my all-girls high school. We expected a professional coming to speak to us about the future of women in science and engineering. Instead, we were given a giggly woman in a flamboyantly sequined jumpsuit, telling us that engineering isn’t all about building rocketships and bridges—it’s also about creating makeup. She told us that engineers aren’t just men or ugly masculine women, but (shocker!) that pretty girls can be engineers, too. And she also mentioned she liked bunnies. Many, many times. She even showed us an animation of a bunny she created (“See what cute things you can make with computer science!”) that looked like something I created in fourth grade with Microsoft Paint.
I felt belittled, and I felt like she was belittling herself and female engineers everywhere instead of empowering them. Nevertheless, I hoped this was just an isolated case, and I hoped that other female empowerment movements would not disappoint me.
Recently on LinkedIn I stumbled upon an article written by a founder of yet another female empowerment movement. The article opened with a description of “strong and successful alpha (masculine) women.” Forget the whole “Ban Bossy” movement that Beyoncé and others made famous. This assertion—made by a woman claiming to empower other women, no less—is claiming that assertive women are not just “bossy,” but also just flat-out masculine. Ouch.
She then went on to talk about how it’s worrying that so many women are acting “masculine” in order to succeed in the professional world, and that they are spending too much time in the “masculine zone”—you know, by being assertive and actually standing up for themselves. And everyone knows that if a woman spends too much time acting like a man, she eventually loses her “feminine energy” and all the intrinsic qualities that go with being a woman, such as the “ability to feel compassion, to be intuitive, to heal, and to support.”
I felt sickened by this article. I was disgusted by the antiquated and completely arbitrary gender roles that the writer took for granted—that women are somehow more caring and more in touch with their emotions, and that men are better at fixing things and “getting stuff done.”
Strong and successful women are not masculine, and supportive and caring men are not feminine. Those are just random qualities that can be found in both men and women. Qualities like assertiveness and efficiency are not inherently masculine, and qualities like kindness and empathy are not inherently feminine. That is as sexist as it is to say that men belong in the workforce and women belong in the kitchen, or that men are naturally better-suited for "masculine" jobs like that of a lawyer or CEO, while women are naturally better-suited for "feminine" jobs like that of a social worker or nurse.
We already live in a society where men feel overwhelming pressure to be emotionless and stoic, lest they be perceived as “weak” or “pussies.” We already live in a society where women are not taken seriously in the workforce and told that their main priority should be getting married and raising a family. Does this author really think she’s empowering women? She’s not empowering women. She’s just bringing society back about fifty years.
I am willing to keep an open mind about female empowerment movements. For the most part, however, they seem to be more detrimental than helpful, more belittling than uplifting. Female empowerment movements may claim to be empowering women, but what they are really doing is pigeonholing both sexes into predetermined life and career paths, and even personality traits. And that’s not fair to men or women.

The Olympic Games continue to stray farther and farther from the democratic roots of its birthplace.
Last week, Mayor Marty Walsh signed an agreement with the United States Olympic Committee that bans Boston city employees from speaking out against the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee, and the USOC. This ban was instituted following the USOC’s selection of Boston as its official bid city for the 2024 Summer Games.
The motivation behind the ban is clear: The IOC, which will select the 2024 Olympic city in 2017, has emphasized the need for local support as a necessary parameter for hosting the Games. In a transparent attempt to make its bid more appealing, the USOC and Mayor Walsh have caved to the ludicrous demands of the IOC.
This ban represents nothing short of an infringement of the basic First Amendment rights guaranteed to all Americans; further, it is a continuation of the disturbing trend toward the subversion of local opinion and laws during the Olympic selection process.
This is wrong. Local laws need to come before anything required or wanted by the IOC—neither Boston nor any other perspective Olympics city should be bullied into unlawful actions simply for the sake of appeasing the IOC. And there is little doubt that the ban is unlawful: Legal experts have been outspoken about the infringements of the city employees’ rights of free speech.
While Mayor Walsh has stated that he will not limit the free speech of employees—effectively rendering the ban toothless and mute—the ban nevertheless highlights the opaque nature of the Boston’s Olympic bid, one that has often left local residents without a voice in the matter. Most notably, Mayor Walsh has ruled out a referendum on the matter, despite the overwhelming support for one. As we have previously noted, the people of Boston bear the burden of the Games, not only for three weeks in July and August of 2024, but also for the preparation before the Games and the cleanups and deficits after. Despite being a source of tremendous pride, hosting the Games has many downsides, which can include unforeseen costs, construction, and diverted attention from other, more important, public needs. It is the people of Boston who will be impacted most from hosting the Olympic Games, and it is the people of Boston who deserve most to have a say in the process.
One year ago, Marty Walsh assumed the Mayor’s Office with promises of transparency. Just recently, he followed upon those promises with further assurances to maintain a transparent Olympic bid process—he points to the scheduled public forums and release of the bid specifics as examples. However, the city remains divided on the costs and benefits of hosting the Olympics. At a bare minimum, people need to be able to speak their minds freely, without fear of repercussions. The ban signed by Mayor Walsh is a repudiation of both his own word and those of the Framers.
All Bostonians—citizens of a free and democratic city—including those who work for the city, deserve to have a say in whether their city hosts the 2024 Summer Games. A repeal of the ban and the opening of public discussion would be a proper first step.

Over the past 150 years or so, African Americans have undergone five or six identity transformations. At one point, “colored” was considered a perfectly respectable term. Over time, colored people became Negros, Negros became black, and slowly blacks are becoming African-Americans.
By changing our names, we hope perhaps to alter the meaning of our identity—the word “colored” smacks too strongly of oppressive racist laws and Jim Crow. “African-American” supposedly places us on equal footing with the other ethnic groups that comprise the American melting pot. Yet even this last label carries with it the whiff of otherness, if only because our default image of the unhyphenated American continues to be white.
Having (supposedly) abandoned the white/non-white duality that defined most of its history, America has embraced a new equally dangerous dichotomy between the “ethnic” and the “universal.”
Blackness as we know it today was initially invented as a way to maintain order in America’s slave society. Before they were kidnapped, West Africans knew themselves as whole people, marked by their particular religious customs, familial histories, and places in society. Only in America did they become “coloreds” defined by their reduced personhood in comparison to whites. As laws designed to maintain the purity of the races failed to prevent slave owners from sexually assaulting their female property, blackness became less a category than an attribute—a marker. Instead of producing mixed offspring, masters and slaves produced a variety of marked peoples from “mulattos” to “octoroons.” Under the one-drop rule, blackness was not a particular racial ancestry, but a stain that persisted up to the fourth generation. To be black had no particular cultural or ethnic meaning except as a basis and justification for social exclusion.
As it has become increasingly difficult to justify the explicit disenfranchisement of black people, blackness has been redefined as a cultural and moral attribute. The negativity of black identity has been maintained through twin processes of appropriation and denigration. “Good” black inventions like jazz, soul food, vogueing and the cult of the booty tend to lose their black specificity and become absorbed into broader American culture. Meanwhile generalized societal ills like drug abuse are transformed into “the black drug problem,” regardless of statistics indicating that blacks and whites use drugs at similar rate.
Research from Harvard’s Project Implicit suggests that these associations are common to most Americans and take place automatically and unconsciously. Americans of all colors usually find it easier to associate negative terms with blackness than to associate negative terms with whiteness. With this schema firmly planted in our minds, it is unsurprising that anti-black racism is so resilient.
Having established a racial category for what is wrong in America, we are quickly able to adapt to new social norms. As homophobia has declined for all ethnic groups, and support for gay rights has become the new orthodoxy, “black homophobia” has emerged as a national concern. America offers the ambitious black student two options— he can either serve as “a credit to his race"—or he can transcend race entirely to become the kind of person who is “never thought of as black.”
I find neither option particularly satisfying. Instead of accepting or forfeiting the limited “black” inheritance that America offers me, I would like to stake my claim to the country as a whole. I would like to try unhyphenated “American” on for size, not because I would like to join the cult of those who don’t see race, but because I want to take back my full inheritance—hundreds of years of stolen labor, wealth, and ideas that have magically become “colorless.” The America that we think of as “universal” is black to its very foundations, and its time that we recognize it as such.

This past week I delivered a lecture at Columbia University on academic freedom and anti-Semitism.  I argued that it is the essence of academic freedom that all members of our community can hold whatever views they wish and express them freely. But it is equally the essence of academic freedom that universities as institutions must avoid acting in a way that suggests that they endorse any one position in a political controversy. Because if a university itself starts to take sides, there is both a risk of chilling dialogue and debate within the community and of undermining public confidence in the university’s academic and research pursuits. These risks are magnified if a university repeatedly lends its imprimatur to the same controversial viewpoint on inherently political questions.
I have a growing concern this has happened with respect to Harvard, Israel, and the Middle East. This weekend, in an attempt to garner information about the snowstorm, I looked at the University's official website, the principal window that Harvard presents to the world, and where it highlights especially significant University accomplishments. My eye caught the “Global Engagement” section of the website, where I was surprised to see an op-ed by a Research Fellow at Harvard’s Middle East Initiative proclaiming without qualification that “what is certain is that Israeli-Lebanese-Syrian-Iranian tensions and active warfare would not be a recurring problem, as in fact they are, had Israel responded to the Arab peace plan.”
While I find this assertion absurd, others would disagree, and it would, of course, be wrong for the University to censor either opinion in any way.  It is, though, equally wrong for such an opinion to be given pride of place alongside stories with subjects like Harvard fighting breast cancer, a time lapse of Annenberg Hall, and an audio feature on Robert Frost as a Harvard voice.
No one should overreact to one incident with respect to the University’s website. Unfortunately, the official showcasing of a patently anti-Israel article is not an isolated example. Late last year, through some failure of administrative oversight, Harvard University Dining Services altered its procurement policy to avoid purchasing soda machines originating in the West Bank. Unlike many universities who gave up their membership in the American Studies Association in response to the Association’s boycott of Israeli scholars, Harvard remains an institutional member. And on multiple occasions in recent years, the University's imprimatur—and seeming endorsement—has been bestowed to support conferences at which speakers advocated the end of Israel as a Jewish state.
In 2012, a Vice Provost of the University was the keynote speaker and “Harvard guest” at the Harvard Arab Alumni Association's conference in Damascus. Conference materials made clear that the conference's patron was The First Lady of Syria, who was described as “an...inspiring and tireless leader...[who] supports President Assad by fostering the emergence of a robust, independent, and self-sustaining society.” Since that time the Assad government has killed several hundred thousands of its citizens and been recognized as an exporter of terrorism.
Of course Harvard as an institution and its leadership have no objective of demonizing Israel or supporting terrorists. Nonetheless, the failure to maintain controls sufficient to prevent activists from hijacking the University’s name and reputation in support of their objectives is a very serious issue and has led to concerns of community members who feel that they are being attacked. When Harvard allows its reputation to be attached to pernicious ideas, it raises the risk that they will be seen as legitimate in more and more places. And as the University intrudes into politics, the risks that political actors will seek to regulate its activities are enhanced.
And there are fundamental moral issues. More than a decade ago, as a University president faced with petitions that Harvard divest itself of all investments in Israel, I made a speech asserting that these actions would be “anti-Semitic in effect if not intent.” There is nothing wrong with criticizing Israel, and I for one believe that aspects of its settlements policy are misguided and potentially dangerous. Yet the US State Department was correct when it stated in its “Anti-Semitism Monitor” that “while criticism of Israel cannot automatically be regarded as anti-Semitic, rhetoric that demonizes, delegitimizes, or applies double standards to Israel crosses the line of legitimate criticism.”
In a world of increasing complexity and increasing intolerance, Harvard’s example has never been more important.  If Harvard is to lead on academic freedom it is essential that we all feel free to assert our views but that our University protect with ferocity its reputation by preventing views demonizing Israel or any other country from being bestowed with its good name.
Lawrence H. Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus of Harvard University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 3, 2015, at 1:45 a.m.
All cases of alleged sexual harassment by faculty, teaching assistants, and researchers within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will be investigated by Harvard’s central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, rather than a separate body, according to the school’s recently approved sexual harassment policy and procedures.
The finalized FAS procedures, which remain largely unchanged from a draft version presented at December’s Faculty meeting, were released Monday. In addition to minor changes to the language of the procedures, the committee tasked with finalizing them created a frequently-asked-questions section that addresses faculty and student relationships and confidentiality agreements for faculty who are psychiatrists, among other topics.
Alison F. Johnson, a History professor who led a committee to bring the FAS procedures in line with the University’s central standards, said she and the committee wrote the FAQ based on questions that they had heard over the past few months.
FAS adopted interim sexual harassment procedures last August after Harvard unveiled a University-wide policy to centralize its approach to handling sexual harassment. This policy had established a central investigative office, ODR, to handle cases filed against students—but not faculty and staff—across the University’s schools.
For months, the committee led by Johnson worked to expand the office’s jurisdiction to include alleged harassment by FAS faculty and staff. The FAS procedures that were released on Monday confirmed that ODR will now conduct these investigations, thereby replacing the Office for Faculty Affairs, the internal FAS body that had examined these matters under the school’s previous policy and under its interim policy.
Faculty cases were not moved to ODR when the office was established last year because the University felt that addressing the management of student cases was the priority.
But in the updated draft of the policy presented to the Faculty in December, Johnson and the committee recommended that faculty and staff cases be investigated by ODR.
The finalized procedures, whereby faculty cases are officially handed over to ODR, are dated Jan. 13, 2015, and the FAQ portion is dated Jan. 15.
In addition to expanding ODR’s jurisdiction, the new FAS policy explicitly forbids romantic or sexual relationships between faculty members and undergraduates. It also prohibits romantic or sexual relationships between faculty members and students, graduate or undergraduate, enrolled in their courses or otherwise under their academic supervision.
Cases of quid pro quo sexual harassment—the exchange of sexual acts for another benefit—within student organizations in the FAS are also prohibited, and will be subject to the finalized procedures.
In an interview in early January, Johnson said the committee had only altered some of the draft procedures' language since the December Faculty meeting, mirroring the finalized procedures released Monday. She said at that time that “the committee has more or less finished its work” and hoped the policy would be ready for FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s review by mid-January.
Smith, for his part, said he and Johnson kept in constant communication while the procedures were drafted to ensure that the language would be clear for anyone reading.
“I was effectively a guinea pig for the rest of the Faculty, and the community, to say, ‘This is going to be read by a lot of people who aren't doing the day-to-day discussions on this,’” Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In yet another entry in the back-and-forth legal saga surrounding allegations of sexual misconduct against Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor emeritus has filed a new response in court, repeating his denial of the accusations against him.
In the Feb. 2 filing, Dershowitz and his legal team again deny the claims of “Jane Doe No. 3,” who has accused Dershowitz of having sex with her while she was a minor. The latest filing questions "Jane Doe No. 3's" credibility and calls for the court to strike the allegations of his misconduct.
The filing is part of a civil court case that challenges a plea deal that Dershowitz helped to negotiate for Jeffrey E. Epstein, a billionaire and prominent Harvard donor who went to prison in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution but avoided federal prosecution.
The accusations against Dershowitz first surfaced in a Dec. 30 court filing, which alleged that Epstein forced “Jane Doe No. 3” to have sexual relations with Dershowitz when she was underage. In response, Dershowitz took both legal and public steps of his own, filing to intervene in the case to protect his reputation as well as denouncing the claims to a number of media outlets.
Since then, both Dershowitz and the lawyers for “Jane Doe No. 3,” Paul G. Cassell and Bradley J. Edwards, have taken subsequent legal action to support their respective claims, namely filing sworn affidavits and a defamation suit. This latest chapter is Dershowitz's first legal response after “Jane Doe No. 3” filed a sworn affidavit reaffirming her allegations on Jan. 21.
Much of this most recent filing echoes Dershowitz’s earlier claims in the legal dispute, namely that he did not have sexual relations with “Jane Doe No. 3” and was not aware of Jeffrey E. Epstein’s abuse of underage women. It also challenges the accusation that Dershowitz negotiated Epstein’s plea deal as a way to protect himself and any other “co-conspirators” in the case.
The filing raises doubts about the validity of the testimony of “Jane Doe No. 3,” claiming that there exist inconsistencies between her different accounts of her contact with former President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Stating that future “evidence will show” her allegations to be false, the filing calls “Jane Doe No. 3's” sworn affidavit “perjurious.”
In an interview Monday, Dershowitz said that inconsistencies in the alleged victim's prior claims will be important in proving his innocence, arguing that they indicate a tendency to fabricate stories about “prominent people.”
“It’s proof that what she said about me is a totally made-up fantasy,” Dershowitz said.
Both Cassell and Edwards declined to comment about Dershowitz’s latest legal action.
This filing comes after 38 Law School professors signed a letter “in support of” Dershowitz, criticizing the format of the case and the extent to which Dershowitz could directly respond to the allegations in court.

The Harvard Advocate—the College’s quarterly literary magazine—launched a redesigned website Friday as part of a larger initiative to increase its readership and social media presence. The undergraduate publication will also soon begin a $150,000 fundraising drive in honor of its 150th anniversary, which comes in 2016, according to its president Kiara F. Z. Barrow ’16.
The new website, the first redesign since 2010, features uploaded content from recent issues and information about the magazine’s submission process. According to Advocate Publisher Colton A. Valentine ’16, a Crimson magazine editor, members first conceived of the redesign in 2012, and collaboration between the design and technology boards began in earnest last semester.
The new website, along with a push to increase the Advocate’s presence on social media, will help bring the magazine from its primarily print readership to a broader digital audience, Valentine said.
“We’ve always produced really strong content, but it hasn’t necessarily gotten the readership or recognition that its quality deserves,” Valentine said. “We’ve been realizing it’s important to have a strong social media presence and a strong digital presence go hand in hand to make sure people are actually reading our content.”
In addition to the website, the group aims to digitize the magazine’s archives, publish an anthology, and unify the blog with the website for the 150th anniversary,said Barrow, who is an inactive Crimson magazine editor.
“The website will be a really great way to bring all these projects together and get the magazine more digitally integrated,” Barrow said. “The feature, design, and tech boards will work together to create new ways of reading the magazine and seeing the art that we publish.”
The website precedes the launch of the Advocate’s $150,000 capital campaign that Barrow says will finance four main priorities: a financial aid initiative, the digitization of all archives, physical building repairs, and fortification of the publication’s endowment.

UPDATED: February 3, 2015 at 2:55 a.m.
After another bout of snow dumped over a foot in Cambridge on Monday, some students and professors expressed difficulty in traveling to and around campus though the University remained open.
The storm arrived less than a week after winter storm “Juno” blanketed the area in a blizzard, forcing Harvard to suspend operations and prompting a reshuffling of the shopping week schedule. While students enjoyed winter festivities ranging from sledding to snowmen during last week’s day-off, both students and professors said Monday’s storm proved more an inconvenience than a welcome break.
Monday’s storm caused Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh to announce a snow emergency in Boston, and both Boston and Cambridge Public Schools were closed Monday and will remain closed Tuesday.
Although most Harvard classes met as scheduled, some were cancelled due to the weather. These included Religion 57: “Faith and Authenticity: Religion, Existentialism, and the Human Condition,” Statistics 171: “Introduction to Stochastic Processes”, and History 1290: “The History of the Russian Empire.”
Associate Professor Kelly O’Neill, who teaches History 1290, said that she cancelled class because she did not think she could travel to Cambridge in time for her 10 a.m. class.
“By 9 a.m. I decided there was no way I was going to be able to get to class,” she said, adding that for professors who do not live in Cambridge, traveling to campus poses a heightened challenge. O’Neill lives in Melrose, almost 10 miles away from campus, and said she has two young children who were home from school.
Another professor who cancelled class Monday, Natesh S. Pillai, who teaches Statistics 171, echoed O’Neill’s sentiments. He said that his commute from Wakefield, which is almost 15 miles from campus, may have been dangerous in Monday’s snowy conditions.
“It’s a huge commute, and I didn’t feel safe,” he said.
Though most students have a far shorter commute than their professors, some said Monday’s winter wonderland still was difficult at times, with some students slipping and sliding their way across campus.
“It was inconvenient trying to hop over the big piles of snow outside of Greenough,” Kamran M. Jamil ’18, said.
Camille J. Schmidt ’18, who recently tore her ACL and requires crutches, said she made her way to all of her scheduled classes despite the weather and her injury.
“Mostly, I had to hack through the snow,” she said, adding that most of the snow around her dorm had not been plowed when she left for class.
Yet for other students, the weather changed little about their daily schedule, and they went about their day as they usually would.
“Today, I did my p-set,” Andrew L. Gordon ’18 said.

UPDATED: February 3, 2015 a 3:49 a.m.
Harvard heavily figures into the plans for Boston’s bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics and could benefit, potentially cost-free, from modifications to its existing athletic facilities, according to Richard Davey, the chief executive officer of the non-profit group coordinating the city’s bid.
If current plans hold and the International Olympic Committee picks Boston, Harvard could host up to 10 events in the 2024 games. Field hockey would be played at Harvard Stadium, and the Albert H. Gordon Track and Tennis Center would host fencing. Overlays are slated to be built in both venues to support Olympic traffic and competition.
Harvard property in Allston is also slated to host aquatics and tennis in temporary venues that would be built specifically for the games.
According to Davey, any renovations to other existing Harvard facilities would be funded by the bid. The University would likely have to pay to use any new facilities after the Games.
“If the 2024 partnership is making modifications to existing Harvard facilities, those would be our costs,” Davey said. “If there are new facilities Harvard wishes to keep in the future, it would probably be a split cost.”
As Boston seeks the games, Harvard has emerged as a major brand associated with the bid.
“Harvard has proposed to play a big role in 2024, and we’re excited about those possibilities,” Davey said. “Harvard is renowned around the globe and continues to be an important brand for Boston.”
Bid documents have also emphasized other colleges and universities in the Boston area, which boasts nearly 250,000 college students. A “University Cluster” will encompass the area including Harvard, MIT, and Boston University. Other universities that will potentially serve as venues include the University of Massachusetts Boston and Tufts.
“Working with colleges [and] universities, which are going to be able to provide space, facilities, and other important contributions to the Olympics, is one of the most exciting parts of the bid because they are as excited as I think proponents of hosting the Olympics are,” said Kennedy School of Government professor Juliette N. Kayyem ’91, who serves on the Boston 2024 executive bid committee. “It’s about Boston.”
Harvard’s executive vice president, Katherine N. Lapp, serves on Boston 2024’s college and university engagement committee along with representatives from MIT, the University of Massachusetts, and Bentley University. Lapp did not respond to requests for comment.
Harvard spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that Harvard officials have been involved in preliminary discussions about the Boston 2024 Olympic bid and will continue to participate in discussion, making sure that any potential participation in the Olympics is consistent with the University’s academic mission.
Henrik Rummel ’09, who won a bronze medal rowing in the 2012 London Olympics, said he is excited for the possibility of the Olympics coming to his alma mater and is confident that the University’s facilities could host Olympic sporting events.
“Harvard has 42 Division I sports,” Rummel said. “We have plenty of  facilities. Converting them in a short time and making them world class facilities doesn’t take a lot.”
Not all are sold on the committee’s proposal. Christopher Dempsey, a graduate of Harvard Business School and co-chair of No Boston Olympics, a volunteer organization opposing the bid, questioned whether it would be in Harvard’s long-term interests to be involved in the 2024 Olympics.
“Clearly its very attractive to the [United States Olympic Committee] and [International Olympic Committee] to be associated with the Harvard brand,” Dempsey said. “Given the overwhelming academic evidence that Olympics do not benefit hosts in the long run, it’s somewhat troubling that members of the University community have jumped two feet in to supporting the Boston 2024 bid.”
Addressing the age-old question of whether the Olympics are ultimately beneficial to host cities, Dempsey and his colleagues argue that the burden of the games will ultimately fall on Massachusetts taxpayers and, while exciting in the short run, will prove costly in the long run.
The host of the 2024 Olympics will be announced in 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 3, 2015, at 2:20 a.m.
In an op-ed published in The Crimson on Tuesday, former University President Lawrence H. Summers criticized what he called Harvard’s “failure to maintain controls sufficient to prevent activists from hijacking the University’s name” in support of anti-Israel scholarship and viewpoints.
Summers cited numerous examples that he alleged might imply Harvard’s support for anti-Israeli viewpoints. He focused in particular on a recent op-ed written by Rami Khouri, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs’ Middle East Initiative.
That op-ed, which is featured on a section of Harvard’s web page and addresses the conflict in the Middle East, reads in part: “What we can conclude, I suggest, is that we would not be in this situation had Israel seriously studied and responded to the 2002 Arab Peace Plan that provided an important opening to negotiate a permanent, comprehensive and mutually just peace accord between the Arab states and Israel.”
Summers wrote that he came across the op-ed while searching for information about Monday’s snowstorm and objected to its being given what he called “pride of place” on Harvard’s website alongside articles about breast cancer research and Annenberg Hall.
Summers also referenced Harvard University Dining Services’ controversial decision last spring to suspend purchases from a company with a factory in the West Bank and the University’s continued membership in the American Studies Association, which boycotted Israeli academic institutions in 2013.
Summers emphasized that he does not take issue with all criticisms of Israel.
“There is nothing wrong with criticizing Israel, and I for one believe that aspects of its settlements policy are misguided and potentially dangerous,” he wrote.
However, he cautioned against the appearance of Harvard taking a political stance on the issue. “If a university itself starts to take sides, there is both a risk of chilling dialogue and debate within the community and of undermining public confidence in the University’s academic and research pursuits,” he wrote.
Harvard’s president from 2001-2006, Summers in the op-ed advocated for free speech among individuals in an academic community but maintained that universities themselves should not “[act] in a way that suggests that they endorse any one position in a political controversy.”
In an interview Monday evening, Summers reaffirmed his criticisms.
“I do think there is a kind of failure to have controls in place and to respond after these episodes take place that’s unfortunate, and I hope that my piece contributes to an attitude where there will be more controls in place to prevent the University from being politicized,” he said.
He refrained, though, from criticizing any University officials by name.
“I don’t think it’s right to blame any individual, and I certainly don’t think that anyone in the University’s senior leadership has any of the kinds of attitudes that I condemn,” Summers said.
Jeff Neal, a Harvard spokesperson, did not respond to a request for comment when reached late Monday night.
Summers has energetically defended Israel in the past. In a 2002 address at Memorial Church, he responded to what he said were movements against Israel on Harvard’s campus and in academia, calling such actions “anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent.”

CORRECTION: February 3, 2015
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article miscontextualized a statement of former University President Lawrence H. Summers regarding criticisms of Israel. In fact, Summers wrote that he does not take issue with all criticisms of the state.

­PHILADELPHIA — Let’s take a look at the second night of Harvard men’s basketball.
Literally, I’m talking about Saturday night’s 63-38 victory over Penn to sweep a back-to-back road trip against the Quakers and Princeton.
But I’m really talking about something that came up in the postgame press conference, so let’s skip the 25-point beatdown the Crimson put on Penn and go behind the bleachers at the Palestra, inside some wooden French doors, and into a small press conference room.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker sits at the front, hunched like a chess player, hands kept underneath the table. Not many questions concern the big win, so he has a chance to get a little more philosophical.
A couple questions in, Amaker discusses the challenges of the Ivy League’s back-to-back-heavy schedule. This weekend’s Friday-Saturday road trip was the first of four that will largely determine the Ivy results.
Specifically, Amaker talks about those Saturday games—suiting up again in a new city against a new team with the same goal you had in the previous night’s game.
“We’ve talked internally a lot about the second night, how critical and important it is in this conference,” Amaker said. “Whatever you do on Friday, win or lose, how important the Saturday night game can and will be and we’ve embraced that through the years here.”
Sure, Harvard’s been great on those second nights for a long time. But maybe Amaker is not only talking literally about playing Saturday after playing Friday.  Really, every game after the opener is the second night—a chance to bounce back or a time to forget past success.
Harvard has had to do plenty of both so far this year. The collection of zits on its portrait keeps growing. There was the loss against the Crimson’s first Division I opponent of the year. Then came back-to-back losses for the first time since the Penn-Princeton road trip of 2013.
Later, a loss to Boston College snapped a six-game winning streak against the local rival. Most recently came a defeat in Harvard’s Ivy opener, which dropped the Crimson out of the Ivy’s top two for the first time since 2010.
Somehow, the Crimson has had successful proverbial second nights after all of those disappointments. And they’ve done it the same way, by learning from the loss, getting back to practice, and moving on.
That’s what the team did after last Saturday’s loss to Dartmouth, in which it allowed a late 26-2 run to surrender a double-digit lead in a 70-61 loss.
But the second night isn’t just about moving on. It’s also about building on--about evolving from one night to the next.
I told myself I wouldn’t turn this column into a cheap comparison to yesterday’s attention-hoarding Super Bowl, but humor me briefly.
Four months ago, the Patriots were ridiculed and written off after losing 41-14 to Kansas City on Monday Night Football. Afterwards, New England coach Bill Belichick stuck to his next-game mantra (“We’re on to Cincinnati”).
But successful football is not just about going from game to game, it’s about growing from game to game, and nobody knows that better than Belichick. His teams have always improved immensely over the course of the year, 2014-2015 being no exception.
After Saturday’s game, one reporter asked Amaker if he thought his team was the New England of the Ivy League. On the whole, a pretty silly question. The kind you get when there is not much else to ask about following a blowout win in the second press conference in two days.
But maybe there is at least one similarity this year.I left the University of Virginia game, a 76-27 horror show back in December, thinking this Harvard team might not be as good as it has been in years past—maybe not nearly as good.
It relied too much on one man, senior wing Wesley Saunders, to score. Junior co-captain Siyani Chambers had not taken a leap forward and no wing or forward had emerged to replace Kyle Casey’s or Laurent Rivard’s scoring from the previous year.
That game could have been the end of an era. Instead, it was the prelude to Harvard’s long second night, so to speak.
Since then, the Crimson’s one reliable scorer early in the season has seen his statistics take a nosedive. Saunders was held to fewer than 15 points just once before the UVA game. He hasn’t scored more than 15 since.
By month, his points-per-game average has dropped from 22 in November to 15 in December to 11 in January.
But that’s been good for the Crimson. Saunders had 14 assists and 11 rebounds over the two games this weekend and registered his first zero-turnover performance against Penn.Meanwhile, four players finished in double-figures against Penn, a night after five scored 10 points or more against Princeton.
Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi recovered from his 26-percent-shooting December to shoot 50 percent from the field in January. Senior forward Jonah Travis emerged to provide energy off the bench. Junior Agunwa Okolie had his first two double-digit outings of the year on back-to-back nights.
Sure, the second night refers to a specific quirk of Ivy basketball schedule. But for this team, it could also be a larger mantra. It’s code for tomorrow, for getting another day to attack the same challenge.
And while that four-week stretch during which Harvard went 4-4 looked pedestrian, there was a second night—this weekend—during which the Crimson seemed to get back on track.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The class of 2015 is going out with a splash.
The Harvard men’s swim and dive team (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) finished off the dual meet season with a sweep of Yale (7-2, 4-2) and Princeton (7-3, 5-1) in the annual HYP meet this weekend, winning eleven total events across two days of competition for its third consecutive HYP sweep. With the wins, the Crimson earned the overall dual meet title by going undefeated this regular season.
Harvard defeated the Bulldogs by a score of 271-82 and the Tigers by a score of 190-163.
Coming into the meet, the Crimson was expecting its toughest competition of the year, as both Yale and Princeton were also undefeated in Ivy competition going into Saturday’s races.
“Our energy was unmatched,” co-captain Mike Gaudiani said. “We had some incredible swims out of our guys for this meet.”
Though the meet was a team effort, the seniors shone in their final meet at Blodgett Pool as they celebrated senior day. Since they joined the team as freshman, this group of swimmers has not lost an HYP meet since their freshman season, sweeping both the Bulldogs and the Tigers each of the last three years.
Harvard got off to a strong start on the first day of competition, touching the wall first in six of 10 events to put itself in the lead and giving a strong base to repeat as HYP champions for the fourth consecutive year. After 10 events, the Crimson led Yale by a score of 142-44 and the Tigers, 102-84.
The surprise race of the meet came on the first day of competition in the 400-yard medley relay, when Harvard B relay of freshman Koya Osada, sophomore Eric Ronda, sophomore Max Yakubovich, and senior Spenser Goodman beat out both Princeton and the Crimson’s A relay squads to touch the wall first with a time of 3 minutes, 14.60 seconds. The group was just over a half-second shy of an HYP meet record, especially thanks to Goodman’s strong finish as the anchor with a 20.71 split.
“The one swim that stood out the most was the 400 medley relay B team,” senior Griffin Schumacher said. “No one really thought they would win the event…. [Goodman] split his best 100 freestyle time to chase down the Princeton team and give us a victory.”
Both Schumacher and Goodman anchored several relays that each placed to add to the Crimson’s point totals.
One senior who has been a consistent powerhouse for Harvard is diver Mike Mosca, who took the top spot in both diving events, with a score of 332.10 in the 1-meter and 420.05 in the 3-meter event. The Crimson men were able to sweep the top three spots in the 3-meter, with freshmen Bobby Ross and David Pfeifer taking second and third, respectively.
Depth was a key to success for Harvard, as it often had multiple swimmers in the top three of events, even when they were beat out by a Yale or Princeton swimmer. As the competition with the Crimson and the Tigers were only separated by 27 points after two days of racing, those finishes were equally as important as the races the team won.
On the second day of competition alone, Harvard had four events in which it claimed the top two podium spots. After losing two consecutive events to the Tigers, sophomore Jack Manchester and Osada regained momentum by taking first and second in the 200 back. A 1-2-3 sweep of the 100 fly by Yakubovich, freshman Steven Tan, and sophomore Jacob Luna regained Crimson momentum as they neared victory.
Harvard swims again when it heads to Princeton for the Ivy League Championship meet on February 26. The Crimson is looking to defend its Ancient Eight title.
“We celebrate today, celebrate our seniors, but we can’t rest on our laurels,” Gaudiani said. “Princeton is an incredibly fast team and they competed lights out this meet. We are going to keep training for the last month before Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 3, 2015, at 3:13 a.m.
And if you drop a decade back, and I'm prepared to do,You find in '93 that Harvard, strange, I know, but true,Let B.U. slip a couple in, but scarcely any more,Which worked out for the Crimson, as they neatly netted four.
The Beanpot inspires odd passions in Boston college hockey fans. They brave Super Bowl hangovers to scream their heads off. They hang a banner for a team that wins two regular season games from the rafters of a 17,000-seat arena. And they sing songs and write poems, like the one by NPR’s Bill Littlefield excerpted here.
It’s what you get when Boston College, Boston University, Harvard, and Northeastern meet at TD Garden over two Mondays (or, thanks to this week’s weather postponement, a Tuesday) in February.
As Littlefield writes, the idea of a Harvard men’s Beanpot champion has, indeed, become a strange one. When the No. 6/6 Crimson (12-5-2, 8-4-2 ECAC) opens the 63rd edition of the tournament today at 5 p.m. against No. 3/2 Boston University (16-4-4, 11-2-2 HE), Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 and his team will be playing against history. Their program has not won a Beanpot final since 1993, and has gotten past the first round only once (2008) in the last 16 years.
Yet this year’s Harvard team has proven to be a special one. With an eight-game winning streak in November and December that included road wins at then-No. 1 BU and then-No. 4 UMass-Lowell, Harvard vaulted itself into the national title discussion after beginning the season unranked.
The team’s play has impressed alumni like Lane MacDonald ’88-89, who earned Beanpot MVP honors in 1989 on his way to captaining Harvard to its only national championship.
“What I’ve been impressed with is just the overall talent level and also just the intensity,” said MacDonald, who was inducted into the Beanpot Hall of Fame in 2014. “They have talent that can score from multiple lines.”
Only recently have new doubts settled around the team’s elite pedigree. Harvard is contending with a series of injuries, none more serious than a leg injury to star defenseman Patrick McNally, who will miss at least the rest of the regular season.
Top sophomore centers Alex Kerfoot and Sean Malone have also been out since late November and mid-December, respectively, and the Crimson played without sophomore forward Luke Esposito, junior defenseman Brayden Jaw, and sophomore defenseman Kevin Guiltinan against Union on Friday.
In Kerfoot and Malone’s absence, Harvard has lost four out of its last six. The two NHL draft picks are back on the ice but skating non-contact, according to Assistant Director of Athletics Communications Brock Malone.
“We’re hopeful that [Kerfoot and Malone] are getting close,” Donato said on Friday.
With key skaters out, Harvard still has talent to spare, starting with junior left wing Jimmy Vesey, who extended his NCAA-best point streak to 19 games with a goal and two assists on Friday. Tuesday’s matchup carries Hobey Baker implications, as Vesey will line up against star freshman center Jack Eichel, the preseason favorite for the nation’s most valuable player award.
The Massachusetts natives enter the Beanpot tied for the national lead in points per game (1.74), while Vesey has the edge in goals per game (0.95). MacDonald, Harvard’s last player to win the Hobey Baker, sees something special in Vesey.
“He is just incredibly dynamic offensively,” MacDonald said. “He makes something happen every shift he’s on the ice in terms of creating opportunities. He has become one of the elite players in college hockey, and his statistics bear that out.”
With Harvard’s resurgence, commentators expect this year’s Beanpot to be one of the most competitive in recent memory. Eichel has led the Terriers to their best start since their 2009 national championship, and BC and Northeastern have hit their strides in recent weeks despite slow starts.
The fates are aligning for another Beanpot worthy of poem and song.
“For two days in February, college hockey really is on par with the Patriots, the Red Sox, and the Bruins,” MacDonald said. “Given the platform, given the visibility, there’s the pride of representing your school, the alums, and your fellow students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A long rest seemed to be all the No. 3 Harvard women’s squash team (7-1, 4-1 Ivy) needed to have success this weekend, defeating No. 6 Cornell (7-3, 2-2), No. 9 Columbia (7-5, 2-3), and No. 10 Stanford (4-9) at the Murr Center. The Crimson dropped just one game over the entire weekend.
Harvard extended its winning streak to four straight matches despite missing an important player: co-captain Haley Mendez. The senior suffered an injury recently that rendered her unable to participate in the weekend’s action.
“The team was pretty confident of doing well on all the matches this weekend despite Haley's injury,” junior Saumya Karki said. “Haley is one of our strongest [players] and her injury is definitely sad, but we have a great line up this year with a lot of depth, so we felt pretty good.”
“I think we were feeling strong, very ready,” added Mendez. “We were ready to play Trinity earlier in the week, but it got postponed to next week due to weather, so we were definitely ready to play come this weekend.”
HARVARD 8, STANFORD 1
The Crimson dominated the weekend, earning the last of its three victories against the Cardinal on Sunday. Looking to extend its streak of complete sweeps to four games, the team started out strong. In the end, Harvard came away with a win, but unlike in its win over Columbia earlier in the day, it would drop a few games.
Sophomore Keegan Mendez fell to Stanford’s Alex Yorke, 3-1, on court nine, but her teammates pulled out wins in the other spots to win the match.
The Crimson’s two freshmen put forth strong performances. Alyssa Mehta won her first match at the first position, defeating the Cardinals’ CC Ho, 3-0. Sue Ann Yong also defeated her opponent, 3-1, to improve her unbeaten streak this season to eight matches.
Also earning 3-0 wins for Harvard were sophomore Dileas MacGowan and juniors Michelle Gemmell, Isabelle Dowling, and Karki. The victories were the second of the day for all four players, including Karki.
“This weekend was a lot about practicing and testing some of the things I have been working on the past couple of weeks,” Karki said. “The matches were pretty straightforward and I think I did well with sticking to my game plan.”
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
In its first action of the day on Sunday, the Crimson won all nine individual matches by a score of 3-0. This was the third game in a row in which no one on the team dropped a game.
At the first spot, senior Amanda Sobhy led the charge, defeating the Lions’ Colette Sultana, moving to 4-0 on the season. On court two, sophomore Katherine Tutrone picked up a victory over Columbia’s Reyna Pacheco. That would be it for the duo, however, as both Sobhy and Tutrone did not play in the team’s second match of the day against Stanford.
Mehta and Yong picked up their first wins of the day on court three and court five, respectively.
“I think everyone played great,” Haley said. “We’ve won four matches now…. I think the team did great to get through a long weekend undefeated.”
HARVARD 9, CORNELL 0
One week after falling 9-0 to Trinity, the Big Red could not best its Ancient Eight rival on Friday, losing by the same score. The Crimson took all nine individual matches—and all by a score of 3-0. This was the second consecutive time that Harvard had won in this fashion, the first coming against No. 13 Franklin and Marshall.
“These wins are definitely a confidence booster as we enter the final two weeks of our season,” Karki said. “[They] also give us a good idea of where we stand in college squash and give us enough time to work on tying up the loose ends before nationals.”
Sohby won her third match of the season on court one, defeating Cornell senior Danielle Letourneau. In her only match of the weekend, senior Julianne Chu earned a sweep over the Big Red’s Reut Odinak at the eighth postition.
Again, the Crimson’s rookie pair had a significant impact. Foreshadowing their performances against Columbia on Sunday, Mehta won at the third spot and Yong was victorious at the fifth position.
With the win, Harvard extended its winning streak against Cornell, bringing its record in the all-time series to 21-0.
“I think the team just needs to carry this momentum to next week when we face a bigger test in Trinity,” Karki said. “The aim right now is to be mentally ready for a close contest and be in top shape physically.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team was midway through the third set of a home matchup against MIT, and the kills continued to pour in for Crimson co-captain and outside hitter DJ White.
On the strength of two spikes and an unwieldy serve, the senior won three straight points, pushing Harvard’s lead to 13-6 and causing the Engineers’ coach to signal for a timeout.
However, the brief delay stopped neither White nor the Crimson (4-3), and the hosts rolled to a three-set victory thanks to a season high of 16 kills from White.
“Tonight we kept it fast,” White said. “Most teams can’t handle our quick offense…. We put them off the net, and it was a pretty easy win for us.”
White came up the biggest at the end of the second set with the score knotted at 22-22. Over the next four points, White scored two kills to earn a 25-23 game victory.
The set defeat seemed to deflate MIT (4-1, 1-0 UVC), which lost five of the first six points when play resumed in the third set.
Over the match, Harvard dominated all major categories. The Crimson rolled to 42 kills and 51 blocks compared to respective totals of 28 and 37 for the Engineers.
“We were playing really crisp,” outside hitter Branden Clemens said. “We were passing well for the most part, and we were getting really good sets…. Things are starting to click.”
This offensive efficiency was apparent from the opening serve, as Harvard committed only two errors in the first game to earn a .565 hitting percentage. With junior outside hitter Alec Schlossman at the server’s position, the Crimson took the first four points of play.
Later in the set, Schlossman also served through a 6-0 run that ended with Harvard up 21-9. During this stretch, the Crimson won all six points on kills, with White and Clemens earning three and two, respectively. The hosts took the set, 25-12.
After racking up 27 service errors over two matches this weekend, Harvard missed only seven against MIT. Meanwhile, the Crimson combined for five aces.
Clemens, who recorded a pair by himself, headed the Harvard serving attack. Especially in the early going, the Engineers struggled to return his topspin-heavy serve, and Clemens won at least one point every time that he stepped behind the end line.
“I’ve been working on my jump serve,” Clemens said. “Yesterday, I think we served for probably 30 minutes…. We’ve really been focusing on that, and I thought we saw some really good results tonight.”
Despite facing a 15-11 deficit in the second period, MIT stormed back to take its first lead of the game at 17-16 and elicit cheers from its section of traveling fans.
However, the applause was short-lived, as White’s late kills helped the Crimson claim the game.
In addition to his offensive production, White contributed two blocks to a defense that rejected the ball 18 times on the night. Clemens topped the bunch with six blocks, the same number that the Engineers recorded as a team.
“I was really focusing on lining up the ball really well,” Clemens said. “We went over some keys for how we want to block for our first conference game on Friday, and I was just…focusing on trying to block like that.”
MIT adjusted to Harvard’s defensive success by relying on tips over the Crimson’s first line of blockers.
While this strategy kept the second set close, the match returned to blowout form late in the game, when Harvard won seven of the last eight points of play.
Although the Engineers entered the matchup with an undefeated record, this label proved misleading, as MIT had only squared off against Division III programs. The Crimson has now won four consecutive matches against its crosstown opponent.
“We feel good,” White said. “We’ve played some good opponents, and I think we’re up to speed with where we need to be at.”

It’s Groundhog Day, which means we find out whether we’ll be living in a tundra for 6 more weeks, or we’ll be seeing happier and sunnier times. While there are many top groundhogs to watch for accuracy, Punxsutawney Phil of Pennsylvania apparently saw his shadow so he predicts 6 more weeks of winter– wait, really? Isn’t it snowing like no other right now while we trudge to classes? But weather aside, the real deal on Groundhog Day is the scandal Staten Island Chuck of New York and New York City mayors have been involved in.
Throwin’ it back to Groundhog Day 2009: former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg used a cob of corn to lure the beloved Staten Island Chuck out of his wooden home, when Chuck apparently bit his hand, piercing through the then mayor’s leather gloves. Someone was annoyed.
Then, on last year’s Groundhog Day, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio accidentally dropped “Chuck.” But the story gets worse, because “Chuck” was then announced dead a week later due to “sudden death injuries” and the “exact cause of the injuries could not be determined,” according to the Zoo. Hmmm.....
Except the story goes on. While everyone was mourning the death of Staten Island Chuck, it was actually revealed that the dead groundhog was in fact Charlotte, a female counterpart that replaced Chuck after fears that he would repeat Groundhog Day 2009 and bite Mayor de Blasio. Literally what is going on?!
So this year, to make Groundhog Day a little bit friendlier and safer between Mayor de Blasio and the real Chuck, Chuck stayed in a roomy glass enclosure, raised into it by an elevator called the “Chuck-a-vator.” He did not in fact end up seeing his shadow, so Mayor de Blasio announced that spring is coming (#blessed). “I think we finally understand each other,” the mayor said to Chuck this year.

UPDATED: February 4, 2015, at 7:17 p.m.
A couple of weeks ago, the New York Times released a Modern Love essay describing a study where, after a series of 36 questions, psychologist Arthur Aron succeeded in making two strangers fall in love. The test is designed to create closeness through probing questions, before the strangers finish the activity by staring into each other’s eyes for four uninterupted minutes. When the author, Mandy Len Catron, tried it with one of her friends from college, she too fell in love. But Harvard students are special, and they merit a unique set of questions that ask not about our greatest fears or most important moments, but rather seek the answers we really need when thinking about future prospects in love:
SET I
1. Given the choice of any professor at Harvard, who would you dine with and why?
2. How many national awards did you receive in high school?
3. Did YOU do Model UN TOO?!
4. How many times have you honestly considered watching the venerated television series Ivy?
5. What is your email signature and what do you think it says about you?
6. What would constitute a “perfect” set of extracurriculars for you?
7. When did you last actually go to the gym?
8. If you had to choose a dining hall that wasn’t your own, which would you choose and why?
9. Do you have a secret hunch about what you’d actually want to be doing if you weren’t interviewing for consulting?
10. What’s your GPA?
11. If you don’t live there, how many times have you been on the Quad shuttle sober?
12. What was the last humblebrag you shared?
SET II
13. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common (besides your school and your pre-med track).
14. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one addition to your resume, what would it be?
15. How many sporting events have you actually attended at this school?
16. How fast can you list the organizations that you are a part of?
18. Pinkberry or Berryline?
19. What is your most treasured memory of Ec10a?
20. How late have you stayed up to finish a CS50 pset?
21. What has been your most quintessential “Harvard” moment here?
22. Take four minutes to describe your freshman blocking story in as much detail as possible.
23. How do you describe the Harvard social scene to friends at large state schools in warm places?
24. What is your opinion about the loss of viewing “best friends” capabilities on Snapchat?
25. How many times have you visited your friends at MIT?
SET III
26. Make three true “we” statements. For example, “we both do not have plans on Valentine’s Day.”
27. What did you enter this school saying you were going to do? What are you studying now?
28. Have you actually ever had sex in the stacks?
29. How many shows have you started watching because everybody else was watching (House of Cards, Game of Thrones, etc)?
30. When did you last cry in front of another person? Was it something to do with accomplishments?
31. What do you think Harvard should spend its $30 billion endowment on?
32. Why did you commit here? Ever regret not going to Stanford?
33. So how do you spell Pfoho?
34. Do you agree with Fox New’s postulation that we are a threat to the gene pool?
35. ARE WE IN LOVE YET?
36. Are you happy at Harvard?
