After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How tall are you, Teddy?” asks Patrick R. Chesnut ’09. Chesnut, a former Crimson arts chair, and Edward “Teddy” Martin ’10 are co-editors of the same publication and both Harvard graduates, yet they have never met in person. This exchange is happening over a Google Hangout, a video chat, which also includes Sanders I. Bernstein’10, a former Crimson arts exec. The three alumni are co-founders of nascent literary magazine The Bad Version.
This brave endeavor has required them to devote almost all of their non-working hours to The Bad Version, a sacrifice they are happy to make because they firmly believe that the conversations they initiate in the magazine not only keep them going but are relevant for other people, too. The magazine is in some ways a liberation from the writers’ day jobs. In an early correspondence with Bernstein about first starting the magazine, Chesnut wrote, “I never write what I want to write, not entirely; I write what I think other people want me to write, or sometimes even what other people think other people will want me to write.”
Starting a publication of their own was a way for these writers to fight the absorption of their own voices into a world of professionalism. At Harvard, all three young men were deeply involved in literary pursuits, writing for The Advocate and The Crimson. After graduation, they found themselves craving a forum in which they could continue asking questions. They missed the electrifying atmosphere of college dorm room discussion, in which they constantly bounced ideas off one another. TBV is a way to keep this atmosphere alive and to extend the conversation to a broader literary community.
BLOWING SPEECH BUBBLES
The magazine’s mission, to the extent that it has one, is expressed by its title. Bernstein explains the meaning  of the name: “In screenwriting ‘the bad version’ is a term that refers to the prototype of a scene, the first idea that gets the ball rolling in the script’s development.” This idea goes some way to explaining why every piece in the magazine, whether an essay, a poem, or a work of fiction, is accompanied by a response. The idea is to constantly reexamine and improve.
Trevor J. Martin ’10, the art director of TBV who designed the cover artwork for both issues, implemented this process of constant review in coming up with the second cover. He started with a drawing of a skeleton which several speech bubbles coming out of it. “But really I just liked the speech bubbles. They were really cute,” he says. He describes working through several iterations of the cover before reaching the final product, which he calls a “conceptual wrapper” for the content.
The aim in starting the magazine was to initiate a dialogue, both at the micro level within the magazine and in the literary community at large. According to the creators of TBV, the publication is the first step in building a forum for modern literary and cultural criticism.
GOOGLE GROUPING
“Teddy is actually only a floating head,“ quips Bernstein, with a grin thats not too subtle for the webcam to register.
“I may not have met you in person, but I have seen you shirtless in other Hangouts,” says Chesnut, before adding in jest, “That’s off the record.”
Martin says, “You can’t retroactively take that off the record.”
Despite the relaxed tone of the Google Hangout, TBV’s second issue launches on Feb. 22, and the three editors are occupied with preparations. Almost all the business of producing the magazine, from determining the contributors and content to organizing circulation, is coordinated via Google Hangout. The three alums chatting this evening live in different locations. Bernstein lives at home in New Jersey; Chesnut is in his hometown of Chicago; and Martin is in the magazine’s heartland, that cradle of literary entrepreneurship, Brooklyn, N.Y.
The interactions between writers are bantering and lighthearted, but there is no mistaking that everyone involved takes the work extremely seriously. Their efforts are reflected in the strides TBV has made since its first issue. As Bernstein says with a hint of pride that even his boundless modesty cannot conceal, “In one issue we have gone from being read to being read about.”
Though they have made progress, the editors are acutely aware of the work that lies ahead. Attracting contributors is a perpetual challenge. With the second issue barely on shelves, Bernstein is already keen to get started on the third, which is currently set to release around May 20.
BREAKING THE MOLD
After sitting in on this virtual meeting, I traveled to New York to meet Bernstein, Martin, and several other contributors to the magazine in Martin’s Williamsburg walk-up. In the the cozy apartment Martin shares with fellow TBV editor, Daniel B. Howell ’08, Neil Young plays softly but insistently on a real record player. A shopping cart full of books is parked in the living room. It was on the street with a sign saying “Take Me,” so Martin and Howell did just that. Its presence in the room affirms the omnipresence of literature in the lives of these individuals.
There are five men in the room, three of whom are wearing plaid. Luke Fentress, a contributor who wrote an essay on the myth of Actaeon and Diana in the latest issue, sips Red Stripe in Martin’s apartment. His eyes move restlessly around the room, alighting on people for little more than an instant before zooming onto their next perch. He is excitable and clearly delights in being provocative.
“You develop a rapport with your editor. You can be really rude to your editor. I was really rude to Teddy,” says Fentress. Martin dismisses this comment with a smirk and a sip of PBR.  “But then you find yourself in contact with ‘the board,’ and all of a sudden you are answerable to people you can’t be rude to.”
Fentress’ take on their review process, which involves two rounds of editing, differs somewhat from Bernstein’s. Bernstein says that the magazine does not enforce a uniformity of style on its contributors and celebrates their individuality. “We are much more relaxed about [style]. Instead we look for inquisitiveness grounded in the eye of the person,” he says.
The editors have made the unusual decision to allow writers to choose their own subject matter rather than dictate content. They prefer to edit contributions rigorously and collaboratively, working closely with the writer. This way of working is integral to TBV’s philosophy. According to the magazine’s creators, this relaxed attitude to editorial protocol gets the most out of writers, encouraging them to run with their ideas rather then curbing them to fit a mold. But it also creates some ambiguity about the roles of those who edit. Chesnut is reluctant to give people formal titles and impose an editorial hierarchy. “I like that we are free-form and flexible,” he says. “Contributing editor sounds like a rung lower than just ‘editor.’”
There is talk of extending the Google hangouts to other members of the magazine staff. All three acknowledge the need to further distribute editorial responsibility among the magazine’s contributors. The current structure leaves most of the administrative work to Bernstein, Chesnut, and Martin. “These people are definitely part of it. They’ve been here as long as we have,” says Bernstein of the other staff writers. His statement exemplifies The Bad Version’s modest, all-inclusive attitude. The magazine is about collaboration, not top-down management.
PRINTCEST
The editors try to steer clear of catering too specifically to a New York readership. However, most of the contributing writers and editorial staff are based in the New York area. The Bad Version is on sale in 15 bookstores and the vast majority are in or around New York City. There are plans to expand into Austin, Texas. “It would be nice to get out of the Northeast,” Bernstein says, somewhat wistfully, but he points out that independent booksellers who might be interested in TBV are more focused on local publications. “One of the ways [independent] bookstores survive is to be part of the local community. [Non-New York] bookstores don’t want to carry Brooklyn lit mags.”
Chesnut, who is from Chicago, is less forgiving on this score. “We want to avoid being an incest[uous,] myopic lit mag,” he says, “but its really hard to get in places that are not where you live.” He has strong views about New Yorkers’ self-proclaimed cultural superiority. In an email to Bernstein when the magazine was in its formative stages, Chesnut wrote, “I really hate writing that acts like New York is the center of the universe…. New York is arguably the most cosmopolitan city in the world, but its people can be just as provincial as those anywhere else, and sometimes more so.”
Judging by the makeup of TBV affiliates gathered at Martin’s apartment on Friday, New York centrism is not such a problem among contributors. Trevor Martin is from Texas; Howell is from Florida; and Cora K. Currier ’10, a former Crimson news editor, is from Arkansas. But despite hailing from far and wide, all are working in New York, in typical New York occupations. Trevor Martin does graphic design for the theater company, HERE; Howell is a graduate student in comparative literature at New York University; Currier is a former fact checker at The New Yorker and now works for ProPublica, an online news publication. You get the idea. A pattern begins to emerge.
Perhaps the more immediate danger is Harvard centrism. Everyone in the room except Fentress is a Harvard graduate. This was not immediately obvious to me, but it was hard to overlook once the discovery that Bernstein, Howell, and I were all in Pennypacker sparked chants of “Pack Attack!” from the two of them. The Bad Version is self-conscious about the preponderance of Harvard grads among its contributors. When Martin mentions that one of the poetry contributors in the current issue is an undergrad at Yale, Howell says sarcastically, “Yeah, we’re really branching out.”
Despite their best efforts to broaden their readership and contributor pool, TBV comprises a select lot. Since the magazine’s mission is to extend the conversation as much as possible, its Harvard umbilical cord must eventually be severed, its editors say.
A LABOR OF LOVE
Given the current abundance of online publications, the decision to print The Bad Version may seem impractical. Its expensive, and theres the tedious business of getting people to sell it for you. Moreover, all the content will eventually be uploaded to the magazine’s website. Despite logistical and financial burdens, the editors of The Bad Version believe very strongly in the importance of printing the magazine. In the minutes from the first editorial meeting, Bernstein writes, “There was the sense that a print magazine is necessary even if not that many people read it because it signals the seriousness of our intent. There is so much on the internet that is just put up there hastily. Having a physical magazine not only suggests that we have limited space and thus must contemplate what we choose to publish, but also that there is some sort of editorial apparatus at work.” Bernstein eloquently expresses a sentiment that everyone involved with the magazine shares. As I sit on Martin’s futon and handle the publication, touching its subtly embossed, bright pink, Arial font cover, flipping through its pages, I cannot help agreeing. Not only is it a statement of seriousness but also a product of much thought and review.
To what extent is printing The Bad Version an exercise in self-indulgence? The magazine itself, though it aims to be for everyone, caters to a narrow sliver of the literary world. The Bad Version sells for nine dollars an issue, which seems a lot for a small paperback publication. But after probing into the founders’ motives for starting the magazine, it is clear that publishing TBV is not self-indulgent, but a labor of love that requires considerable sacrifice. Each major contributor is doing something else to make money. Bernstein prepares students for the SATs and the LSATs. Chesnut works for a non for profit, Campell & Company, writing fundraising and marketing materials. When I suggest that The Bad Version hire summer interns to help with the ever-increasing load of administrative work, Bernstein bursts out laughing, saying, “But an intern is someone you don’t pay. No one gets paid here. If we hire them to do any work, then they may as well be editors, not interns.”
PBR SALON
It was only a matter of time before a conversation among people who live and breathe literature turned to a discussion of former English teachers. Bernstein described one of his disliked high school teachers as a somewhat oxymoronic “Buddhist sadist.” Our discussion is greatly enhanced by the presence of a real life English teacher in our midst.
Joseph F. Quinn ’08 teaches English at his former high school, Regis, an all boys Jesuit school on the Upper East Side. He is greatly enjoying the perks his position entails. He describes rereading “The Scarlet Letter”: “It’s like listening to a pop song again when you’re not a virgin and being like, ‘Oh, that’s what it’s about.’”
Despite Quinn’s jests, the writers of TBV are serious about devising an educational initiative, which could possibly go some way toward making the magazine self-sustainable. Still in the brainstorming stage, the idea would be to supply high school classrooms with stimulus material and questions to engender in-class literary debate. As a high school English teacher, Quinn is the natural person to pilot the educational scheme. He is optimistic about the plan, saying materials that supplement the prescribed curriculum often foster the best conversations. “The other day we were doing “[The Adventures of] Huckleberry Finn,” and someone sent me a letter of a former slave to his master. We started talked about it, and the conversation was fucking awesome. Everyone was so much more responsive.” He is eager to try out whatever The Bad Version devises in his classroom.
In an ideal world, Bernstein would like to make the material available in the public school system. “That would be the dream, to bring The Bad Version to public high schools,” he says. But bureaucracy and red tape make that more of a fantasy than a realistic goal, he says; private schools are a more likely audience.
The Bad Version, with noble but unrealized ambitions, is still in its infancy. While it aspires to great things, its readership is still relatively humble. The conversation at Martin’s apartment is peppered with discussion of a recent Harvard graduate whose rise has been rapid: Jeremy Lin ’10.
“It feels like he’s having success in this very public way, like Jeremy Lin is some sort of avatar,” says Bernstein. If Jeremy Lin is indeed an avatar for young Harvard grads forging a path in the real world doing what they love, then there are great things in store for The Bad Version.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week ago, the state of Washington legalized gay marriage. Three days after that, the New Jersey legislature passed a similar proposal. The tides of equality are finally shifting in America. At the same time, there are those that resist changing the laws of marriage. James P. McGlone, in his recent op-ed in the Crimson, “The Rhetoric of Equality,” stands out as one. But there are many that oppose progress in marriage equality.
Most arguments against gay marriage simply don’t address the central issue of this debate: whether or not there is a legal reason that gay marriage ought not be recognized by the state. Instead, they seem to suggest that a myriad of religiously tinged requirements be fulfilled before a state gives its official blessing to a couple.
When it comes down to brass tacks, many social conservatives argue, the institution of marriage exists for the sake of the biological pairing of a man and a woman. Their job, as sponsored by the state, is to reproduce. If these are the new guidelines of what the U.S. should consider legal marriage, what about those who choose not to have children? What of those who are knowingly sterile before marriage, or those who choose to adopt? Are gay couples any different than these examples? Arguments against same-sex marriage that anchor their rhetorical weight in the importance of reproduction fail to address the point that it is not the responsibility of government to dictate the sexual lives of its legal citizens, especially if it promotes the views of any religious tradition.
Religion aside, it is the responsibility of our government to provide equal protection for the life and liberty of its citizens. If “traditional” marriage is the only barrier between gay couples and constitutional equality under the law, then it is “traditional” marriage, not gay marriage, that is incompatible with the Constitution and what it stands for.
In Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court asserted that Colorado had a legal obligation to apply anti-discrimination laws to the state’s gay community. The repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” signaled the end of military discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the Office of Personnel Management is now interpreting the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to mean that it is unlawful for the government to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Most importantly, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees all Americans “equal protection of the laws.”
An obvious question follows: if it is illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation, why are we discriminating based on sexual orientation? Why is marriage discrimination considered a legally tenable position?
At the end of his article, McGlone challenged proponents of marriage equality to present a viable alternative to traditional marriage. We say: the alternatives are all around you, in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, and now, Washington. Marriage is separated from other relationships by a simple legal distinction and the protections and rights that come with it. The union is consummated by the love shared between two people that want to spend their lives together. And in states where gay marriage is now legal, the institution of the family has not been degraded, public institutions have not changed their curricula or budgets, and life continues on as normal. In short, the only difference in these states is that gay people can now get married.
Now, how about the questions that traditional marriage proponents never seem to answer: Why, in 2009, did states with legalized gay marriage have a lower average divorce rate than states that hadn’t legalized it? Why are kids waiting in foster homes when the adopted children of gay couples have shown the same levels of success as those of straight couples?
It is the responsibility of our government to provide a contract through which two people can enjoy the privileges allowed to them by the law: the right to share health insurance, the right to visit each other in the hospital, the right to adopt, the right to be recognized as a legal entity. Restricting these rights based on beliefs that have no relevance in the legal context of marriage is antithetical to America’s founding principles, and it rejects the dignity of a large population of our fellow Americans.
As long as we continue to assert that the religious foundations of traditional marriage have the ability to infringe upon the rights of all Americans, we cannot truly say that we are a nation equal under the law.

There is something undeniably cool about Jeremy Lin.
Whether it’s his ability to drop three pointers over seven-foot-tall MVP Dirk Nowitzki, outduel a superstar drafted when he himself was eight years old, or break scoring records set by Shaquille O’Neal, Jeremy Lin has become a global fascination, and deservedly so. Lin’s style of play is entertaining to watch not because he relies on freakish athleticism or unconventional tactics, but because his cerebral approach to the game reveals a presence of mind that is all the more extraordinary given his status as an outsider to the National Basketball Association establishment.
Watching Lin is particularly enthralling given the story surrounding the athlete. In a league that largely designates its superstars by their senior year in high school, it is refreshing to see an athlete succeed so profoundly after going undrafted and flirting with irrelevance for a year. However, beyond the conventional story of an underdog’s tenacity is the undercurrent of once-in-a-generation improbability. Regardless of his skill, Lin probably would not have seen professional play if not for a perfect storm of circumstance; the sheer implausibility of Lin’s story is not lost on fans, who recognize that in nearly no other context would the phenomenon that is Linsanity even exist.
Lin’s humility is another aspect of his story that only strengthens his appeal as a model athlete. He credits every victory to his team, refusing to define himself as an individual success story even as the world continues to do so. We somehow doubt that Lin will ever schedule a variety hour if he ever decides to sign with another team. His off court persona, as well as his cooperative style of play, has fostered a long overdue discussion on sportsmanship and respect in an NBA dominated by big personalities and egos.
Another welcome consequence of Lin’s success is the increased national attention paid to the Harvard men’s basketball team. Coach Tommy Amaker’s program is at a historic level of performance; Jeremy Lin’s success as a player only helps highlight the effort that has gone into transforming a previously anemic program into a nationally ranked one. In a conference as oft ignored as the Ivy League, this renewed interest is especially significant.
On a more local note, Jeremy Lin’s sudden success is exciting because of the accompanying increase in sports enthusiasm and school spirit here at Harvard. Lin’s play has energized a college community at times apathetic toward the achievements of its athletes. It’s a testament to the staying power of Linsanity that commentary on his play has joined concentration and hometown as part of the obligatory Harvard introductory conversation. That comedians like Stephen Colbert now give us underdog status when referring to being a Harvard alum as “coming from nowhere” is only icing on the cake.
We would be remiss not to mention Lin’s impact on race relations and his inspirational position in Asian-American community. Intentionally or not, Jeremy Lin breaks thicker barriers with every game he plays. His transformational story is all the more remarkable because it dismantles previously held notions of racial spheres. Linsanity is truly a cross-cultural, convention-defying sensation—one that we hope to see continue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 13 months ago, on a winter Saturday morning, we assembled at a small office in Talaat Harb square, merely feet away from Tahrir. We discussed how our party, El Ghad, would participate in the “Revolution” planned to start three days later, on Tuesday January 25, a day known as Police Day. Some of us questioned each other: you can plan a demonstration or a sit-in or even a general strike, but how can you label a set date and time for a “Popular Uprising,” let alone a “Revolution,” as we had started to call it?
Around mid-January, we and hundreds of others had started to promote the “Revolution” on Facebook and Twitter with the hashtag #Jan25. We gathered key party activists from all over the country to coordinate activities, chants, banners and try to prepare for what would happen. We searched for one word that would capture the spirit of what we wanted. Some friends from other movements had demands such as “setting minimum wage” and “dismissing the infamous minister of interiors,” but we thought it was too late for that.
At the end, we settled on one word: “Erhal,” translated as “Leave” or simply “Out.” We prepared red cards with OUT printed on them, like those used in soccer matches when a player is sent off for violating rules of the game. Indeed, the regime headed by Mubarak had violated every article of the Constitution and every law. Our party witnessed the enactment of an entire book full of oppression tactics against the opposition.
Egyptians have never been famous for being punctual. But January 25 was a date that we kept. Egyptians rose in millions and from the massive crowds emerged a “collective mind” that spelled out unified demands for the revolution which no political leader or party was allowed to negotiate. The rest was history.
But is the Egyptian Revolution really history? I came to Harvard’s Institute of Politics to share my experience with a study group, adopting a theme that suggests that the Egyptian Revolution is far from over. It is true, that Friday after Friday, Egypt activists or “Revolutionaries” assembled in Tahrir and other squares which came to symbolize the revolution in various parts of Egypt They pushed the regime, or what remained of it, to give in to demands for change, inch by inch. It is true that the nature of the relationship between the people and authority in Egypt has changed forever. That itself is the greatest achievement of the revolution and the core guaranty of its success.
But we are far from looking in the eye those who sacrificed their lives for the dream of a new Egypt, where freedom, social justice, human dignity and democracy are more than simply chants, but a way of life. We are far from saying to them, “your dream has been brought to life.” Our promise is far from fulfilled.
The broad title of my study group is “Tahrir, Revolution in Progress.” Some critics would label Egypt’s Revolution as the “Unfinished Revolution.” I think that recent events prove that although the revolution is not complete, it will continue for months and even years to come.
The future of Egypt is determined not only by the movement, but also by how the regime and its new political allies navigate their discourse in the months and years ahead. My study group will also look at the emerging players and process, and investigate possible future scenarios for Egypt and the region. It will explore the parallels between the Egyptian Revolution and the Occupy movement in the US and other countries to answer a key question: are we approaching a wide paradigm shift in the way democracies work around the world, or is this wave of protests simply hype that will soon fade out?
I believe that we may be seeing the beginning of a new world where individual people, empowered by technology, will play an active role in shaping public policy on a daily basis. But for now, I am more concerned with how the Egyptian Democracy movement will manage to turn that inspiring momentum, commitment, and willingness for sacrifice into an organized political force that can peacefully shape the future that Egypt deserves.
Wael Nawara is leading a study group as a Visiting Fellow at Harvard's Institute of Politics Thursdays through March 8.  He is an Egyptian writer, politician and co-founder and former secretary general of Egypt's El Ghad Party (2005-11).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rick Santorum might defeat Mitt Romney in the Michigan primary next Tuesday. It’s worth dwelling for a second on how insane this is. Mitt Romney spent his entire pre-college life in Michigan. He was born in Detroit and grew up in Bloomfield Hills. His father was first the Chief Executive Officer of American Motors, and as such a major public figure in the state, and then governor for six years. His brother is active in state Republican politics, having run for Attorney General in 1998. And Romney won the state by nine points in 2008, despite John McCain having bested him in New Hampshire the previous week. Michigan, along with Massachusetts and Utah (where he can count on heavy Mormon turnout), is one of the states that it just makes no sense for Romney to lose.
But as of this writing, the polls show Santorum beating Romney by an average of five points. The New York Times’ Five Thirty Eight blog gives Santorum a 57 percent chance of victory. I’m still in the camp that thinks a Santorum nomination is basically impossible. To nominate a candidate whose last election ended in a 20-point landslide loss as an incumbent would be an unprecedented act of electoral suicide. Political scientists tell us that primaries are decided, ultimately, by party elites, and I think the elites in question fear a Santorum win enough to stop it from happening. But I also agree with the anonymous GOP senator who’s been telling reporters that if Romney loses Michigan, another candidate needs to enter the race and force a brokered convention. If Romney loses what’s essentially his home state, he can’t be taken seriously as a nominee.
That, too, would be a disaster without much precedent, and it’s worth asking how the GOP got itself caught in this bind. Focusing on any one factor would be a mistake. It’s true that Romney just isn’t a very exciting candidate, that Santorum is more charismatic, and that for socially conservative primary voters, the notoriously anti-gay and anti-birth control Santorum is more appealing than the man who once told an LGBT newspaper that he’d be better than Ted Kennedy on gay and lesbian issues. But in Michigan specifically, Santorum’s relative success may owe to something stranger: he’s running to Romney’s left on economic issues.
While both Romney and Santorum opposed the auto industry bailout that saved Detroit’s manufacturing sector, Santorum has taken issue with the fact that Romney supported the bank bailouts that happened around the same time. “Governor Romney supported the bailout of Wall Street and decided not to support the bailout of Detroit,” Santorum said. “My feeling was that we should not support—the government should not be involved in bailouts, period.” The implication is clear: Romney will bail out big finance, but not auto workers. Santorum may not help anybody, but at least he doesn’t treat the little guy worse.
Even more jarringly, Santorum has spoken enthusiastically about unions, saying, “I have no problem with private sector unions” and recalling his grandfather’s membership in a coal miner’s union. In a way, this isn’t too surprising. Santorum, after all, spent two terms as a Senator from Pennsylvania, a state where unions have a substantial presence and where catering to industrial interests is the only way to get elected. He voted against a national right-to-work law (which would ban union-only workplaces) and pushed repeatedly for tariffs and other union-backed protectionist measures to help the U.S. steel industry.
And, more generally, Santorum represents a kind of Republican who should be anathema to libertarian-leaning Tea Party types. He backed all manner of major government programs in the Bush years, including the Medicare prescription drug benefit and No Child Left Behind. He was skeptical of free trade, voting against The North American Free Trade Agreement while a member of the House.  He said he was “proud” of his record of securing earmarks. When faced with a choice between endorsing fellow Senator Arlen Specter—who would five years later become a Democrat and support the stimulus and health care reform—and economically conservative Representative Patrick J. Toomey, Sr. in a Senate primary, he backed Specter.
Santorum was, in other words, everything wrong with Bush-era Republicanism, according to the prevailing narrative among Tea Partiers. Against a guy like Romney, who seems positively giddy when attacking unions or defending the rights of corporations, that should be a death sentence. In fact, not only has it not killed Santorum so far, but it may also even be helping him in economically depressed and union-friendly Michigan. And if even Republican primary voters are responding well to a guy with that message, it could mean that the past two years’ sharp right turn in economic policymaking is more of a blip than a realignment.

In the deep dusk of winter afternoon, Sparks House continues to glow nearly a year after Reverend Peter J. Gomes’ passing. Between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., soft light streams through the windows in the ground floor rooms, illuminating guests chatting over Wednesday Tea. This tradition, begun by Gomes, restarted in September after a brief hiatus following his death.
Over the years, Wednesday Tea at Sparks House has brought together a diverse cross section of the university to sip from a saucer of Darjeeling or munch on a scone, allowing Gomes to interact with members of the Harvard community outside of his daily services at Memorial Church. Immediately upon arriving at Sparks House, tea-goers would find themselves in the warm embrace of the Reverend. After an initial greeting, they would pass Gomes’ study—on the right—and enter the living and dining rooms—on the left—where tea was prepared. There, a designated “tea-pourer” would pour the steaming beverage from a polished silver tureen. Although the weekly event had little structure, the Reverend insisted on including typical Anglophile customs, choosing a different friend each week be the guest of honor and serve his visitors.
From the pace that the food was brought out, to the table arrangement and the clearing of dishes, Gomes paid careful attention to every aspect of the Teas. A typed note from 1977 reads: “Cut the cakes and sweets into small pieces and arrange pleasingly on canton plates found in the first set of cabinets over the sink. Do not put everything on at the start but pace the food so that it will last.”
The effort Gomes put into Wednesday Tea was not lost on his guests. As he reminisces about Tea with the Reverend, Gund University Organist and Choirmaster Edward E. Jones says, “He decided to start holding Tea at his home every Wednesday and made it into a great tradition. Reverend Gomes was everyone’s favorite part of Wednesday Tea.”
“I think Reverend Gomes had a real appreciation for the importance of social interaction and the preservation of communities. The act of worship every morning wasn’t ever enough. You needed to interact with people outside of church as well,” stresses second-year Business School student Jonas P. Atkins ’01, who was an usher at Memorial Church as an undergraduate.
Today there is no Gomes to welcome visitors to Sparks House, no official tea-pourer to uphold Anglophile custom.
Although Wednesday Tea once hinged on Gomes’spersonality, Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz and Memorial Church Administrative Coordinator Elizabeth A. Montgomery recommenced its revival, feeling that it was an important institution to maintain.
“Wednesday Tea is about having a space on campus where the entire university can come together,” says Katz. “It’s hospitality in its purest form.”
Qin Chen, a visiting scholar at the Graduate School of Education, also adds, “I found out about tea through my husband who goes to Memorial Church. I just wanted to meet people in the Harvard community and discover what tea is like. We don’t have anything like this in our culture.”
Wednesday Tea has a way of bringing together individuals who would otherwise never meet. Everyone comes with her own story to tell.
“No one will ever be able to fill Reverend Gomes’ shoes,” confesses Katz.
And yet Wednesday Tea continues to make the school a little smaller, the idea of a community, perhaps, a little more tangible.

A friend recently tried explaining the difference between singing in French and in English. In French, the Beatles would never have reached the same level of stardom, he said—would never have won over the world with that cheery refrain: “love, love love...love, love, love.” In English the lyrics will always ultimately bow to the tune. French is the opposite: the tune sustains the thought and fills in the background but yields, then, to the words and their meaning, to the language.
This is why there aren’t many internationally renowned French pop stars, I guess. It is also why I feel a vulnerable uneasiness in relearning how to speak.
This is not the first time I have tried to learn a language. I’m accustomed to the constant mild humiliations: the questions misunderstood and mis-answered; the errant qualifier; the slightly furrowed brow of the shopkeeper when I ask for half a kilo of tomatoes. On Sundays I walk up Rue de Rennes, right on Vaugirard, left on Condé to an open-air market. I slow down as I approach to delay the moment when I will have to start talking, so that I can pretend—for a moment—that this city is also mine.
I am used to feeling flatter, less-dimensional, in a foreign language. I have the words to talk about myself—Je viens des Etats-Unis, j’étudie l’histoire et la littérature—yet the words form a layer, thin but sturdy, keeping me largely within the bounds of banal description. I never know if I’m the same person in a language not my own.
But for some reason the stakes seem higher here in Paris. Maybe it’s the emphasis placed on the nuance of speech. Evaluations for class at my university, Sciences Po, include very little writing: courses are organized around the exposé, a 10-15 minute rigidly structured presentation of a topic followed by questions by the class and examination by the professor. For my first exposé I tried to cram in information, pack in analysis and details. My classmates and professor told me to slow down. More important than what I had to say was how I said it—I needed to savor the words more, allow them to linger. A classmate tells me that pure facts matter less here. An education entails learning to speak intelligently about a subject, any subject: the countless exposés are preparation for an inventory of possible sentences, an inventory of articulate turns of phrase.
It is an environment that I am beginning to understand but that in practice remains tantalizingly inaccessible. The gap between my writing and speaking has not yet shrunk to my ideal (nonexistent) dimensions. By the time I form a coherent thought the class has jolted ahead and onto the next theory couched, inevitably, in the comforting cocoon of Foucault. Words proliferate and the language chugs on and it is all very beautiful but still just out of reach.
There’s an expression here for when friends gather for fun but the conversation expands and extends beyond daily matters. They start to quote famous thinkers, bounce ideas off each other, paint grandiose themes in broad rough strokes. Refaire le monde, it’s called: remaking the world. It can be translated, I think, as anything from “putting the world right” to “acting the philosopher.” This is what we do often, I am told, after a night of beers and smoke, in a tiny 6th floor studio in the 5th arrondissement. Novels de poche by Boris Vian perch precariously on a shelf next to a messy stack of vinyls: someone chooses one at random, sets the dialogue to jazz. Everything is said and nothing done and in this we are all complicit.
I love it and want to chime in, but my sentences, though sturdy, are stiff. They lack the shades of gradation that would allow me to contribute, that would fit into the self-aware atmosphere of student pseudo-intellectuals. My jokes are unsubtle; my attempts at irony fall flat. Je suis plus intelligente en anglais, je vous jure—I promise I’m smarter in English—I want to object, though I don’t.
I know this is not a disaster. I am, for instance, learning to listen. That night in the studio I say nearly nothing, not because I have nothing to say, but because nothing I say is quite ready. Luckily they understand—it’s obligatory here to spend the third year abroad, so they tell me they remember what it was like for them in Istanbul, in Melbourne, in Prague. It will get better, they say, easier. Meanwhile the words wash over me and I wade through them and try to digest them and stay afloat, if just barely.
I am learning but am also scared of what I am missing. If there’s something more real than this city’s romantic mystique, I think it’s to be found in the language—to be sought in the phrases that I still largely lack. They are the phrases situated somewhere in between asking for tomatoes and remaking the world. So much in French is only hinted at: entire syllables are hardly aspirated, almost swallowed. So much in France is likewise oblique, lurking beneath a barrier I would so like to pierce. In a place where everything seems to trade on language, I am struggling to find the words.

Robot sex: it’s going to happen and it’s going to be hot.
That, at least, is what David N.L. Levy argues in his book “Love and Sex With Robots.”And that’s what brought the Harvard Book Store’s Philosophy Café together last Wednesday evening.
The monthly discussion group is a reminder that Cambridge is a city brimming with intellectual quirk, both inside and outside Boylston Gate. In his book, Levy argues that people will soon not only enjoy relationships with robots, but will also learn more from them “than is in all of the world’s published sex manuals combined.” Levy predicts that once robots develop enough technologically, they will be able to fulfill all of our sexual and emotional desires.
The crowd at the Harvard Book Store discussing this kinky, futuristic topic is decidedly older and more hipster than the general Cambridge population. A 60-something, talkative man wears orange reflectors around his pant-ankles. Two 20-something philosophy junkies arrive in tortoise-rimmed glasses and striped suits.
The acceptability of love with robots is “all relative,” argues the man wearing orange reflectors, provoking much disagreement. Someone brings up the lady who married the Eiffel Tower. Another mentions Japanese pillow girlfriends. One mentions Kant.
“If you can love a robot and be happy and satisfied then either Kant is wrong or we’re wrong,” he argues. Trust the people of Cambridge to bring Enlightenment thought into a discussion about robot lovemaking. During the break, striped-suit philosophy man introduces tortoise-rimmed glasses woman as his girlfriend. “Do you love her like you’d love a robot?” the man in the orange reflectors asks.
Once debate resumes, discussion gets heated. After hammering out the issue for a while, the group argues over whether or not one can have a mutually consensual relationship with a robot. Questions circulate around the room: How can you tell if anyone is conscious? How can you tell who is human?
“If I were secretly an android, would you still respect me?” someone asks the moderator.
“If you were secretly an android and I respected you less would you respect me less?” the moderator responds. Minds across the room begin short-circuiting. Discussion group members look around shiftily. Can anyone’s humanity be trusted? Maybe not. But if we believe Levy, that may be good news for our sex lives.

Thriller
Nine best friends. One blocking group. Someone must float. Get ready for sabotaged psets, secret midnight meetings at ABP, and calls to parents’ lawyers. Lies. Betrayal. Bitchiness. This Housing Day, no one is safe.
Sports Film
From Newell Boathouse comes the story of a crew team unlike any other. They were a diverse group of rowers who hailed from Exeter, Andover, and Choate. But when the Head of the Charles rolled around, they overcame their differences to become a team. Against all odds, they found a way to bond over beer, BU girls, and interest in the government concentration. Come March, they all ended up in Eliot, just across the river from the boathouse, because Harvard housing is “completely random.”
Romantic Comedy
They were Harvard’s most unlikely pair. She was a folklore and mythology concentrator who gave money to the panhandlers outside CVS. He was studying economics and had a signed poster of N. Gregory Mankiw hanging over his bed. But when he needed a service project to put on his resume and she discovered that the market value of an extensive knowledge of Norse poems was negligible, they realized the one thing they couldn’t fight was fate.
Mystery It’s 8 a.m. The knock will be coming any minute now. Eight freshmen sit in their common room, eyeing the door, drops of sweat rolling down their necks. Whose mascot will be on the other side of that door when the time comes? Which of the eight will be to blame if it’s the quad? Find out in this once-in-a-lifetime viewing experience.
Foreign Language Film
A touching story of bromance across language barriers, Jorge, Vlad, and Jan met at FIP and became fast friends while learning how to grind and use American ATM machines. It didn’t matter that they couldn’t really understand each other; their Hispanic-Russo-German friendship blossomed anyway as they bonded over their mutual disdain for American football and the grammatical inconsistencies of the English language. When it came time to block, there was no question that they would be together forever, although they were slightly irked to discover that the fourth floor of Lamont was not a housing option.
Inspirational True Story
He was rejected by the cool kids, couldn’t really talk to the ladies. He was a loser, and everyone knew it. When it came time to find a blocking group, his only option was his fellow science nerds. But he never gave up. He kept writing code, no matter what the jocks said about him. Then he invented Facebook. Even when you don’t win at blocking, don’t let that stop you from winning at life.
Rated R(vard). Coming March 8 to a theater near you.

Standing in the middle of Tercentenary Theater, it’s clear that Harvard not only owns plenty of the land around Cambridge, but plenty of the area’s wireless bandwidth as well. WiFi networks include the ubiquitous "Harvard University," as well as the locked  "Harvard Dean" and "Harvard Secure." Tourists and local residents can be a part of the Harvard WiFi experience, too: friendlier networks like "Harvard Help" and "Harvard Guest" are provided for those without the secret password to the university’s airwaves.
Yet walking eastward from the Yard towards the humanists’ haven that is the Barker Center, one notices that the network names become a bit more creative. Highlights from a stroll past the Barker Center include "maw" and "vegemite," but these signals have a way of disappearing just before you try to guess their undoubtedly zany passwords.
Then, just as it seems as if private networks have disappeared Prescott St. makes things interesting once more. "Mongoosekid," for instance, reigns supreme outside the Freshman Dean’s Office (perhaps Dean Dingman’s personal moniker), and a trip around the corner onto Harvard St. yields such oddities as "Battlestar," "Obergine," and "Ficktion."
Strolling away from campus down Harvard St. leads to the discovery of a veritable zoo of WiFi signals. Within the next several blocks, network names include  "porkchop," "puppy," "wolfnet," "PinkPanther" (particularly strong), "CleverMonkey," "Chinchilla," "Phoenix," "Dragons," "Camelsback," "pig," and "Clownpig."
One resident of Trowbridge St., "AverageHeight," advertises his or her stature with unabashed honesty to would-be lurkers, while a neighbor, "HotDragBabe," is a bit more sure of his (her?) exceptional looks. While some wireless network owners flaunt their physical attributes, other internet consumers announce their footwear preferences, from "sneakers" to "slippers." Some even try to show off a bit of their pop culture knowledge to neighbors, but with names like "Magical Mystery Tour," "WerewolfBarMitzvah," and "sesamestreet," they also reveal their respective ages (an educated guess: baby boomers, 20-somethings, and young parents, respectively).
One final tip: go back down Broadway towards the Harvard Art Museum. You’re not quite back in Harvard’s Signal City yet, but you know you’re getting close when this network pops up: "yalesucks."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent discovery of a privacy concern at Google has led the director of a Harvard center focused on the societal implications of the internet to call for increased attention to online security.
The security concern arose when a Stanford researcher said that Google was using a loophole in Apple’s Safari web browser to monitor user data on computers and iPhones, even when users indicated in their software preferences that they wanted monitoring blocked on their devices.
Google Inc., which receives revenue from its online advertising, gathers data from web browsing histories in order to target advertisements to user tastes.
Google commonly installs small files called cookies that can tell when users are logged in to Google sites. Ordinarily, Safari blocks this tracking method by default.
However, according to The Wall Street Journal, Stanford graduate student Jonathan Mayer found that Google was circumventing Safari’s default blocking by adding coding to some of its ads.
The coding tricked the Safari browser into thinking a user interacted with a Google advertisement in a manner similar to filling out an online form—thus allowing for the installation of previously blocked cookies.
In a statement quoted in The Wall Street Journal, Google said, “The Journal mischaracterizes what happened and why. We used known Safari functionality to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled. It’s important to stress that these advertising cookies do not collect personal information.”
Google already faced criticism for overstepping privacy boundaries. Last year, the technology behemoth reached a separate settlement over privacy concerns with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
Urs Gasser, executive director of Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said that the most recent scrutiny of Google’s privacy policies will serve as a precedent for handling internet tracking concerns.
“Google is taking a rather aggressive approach and is pushing the envelope quite a bit to figure out how far it can go when collecting data,” Gasser said. “Having players involved who are willing to take the risk to end up in court, [and in] the court of public opinion, is not always a bad thing. Stories like [this one] may have an educational effect for everybody involved in the long run.”
In particular, Gasser said that citizens should educate themselves about the security risks they face online.
“I don’t think any of us, even experts, are really informed about the privacy details of every service we use. It’s too much information,” he said.
Regardless of any privacy concerns, loyalty to Google remains strong among many users.
“I really like Google. I really like the products they create, [and] they all have very nice user interfaces,” said Lucia Mocz ’13, a mathematics and computer science concentrator.

“It’s hard to get people to talk about deficits at their kitchen table when there are so many things going on in their lives,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The Institute of Politics gathered MacGuineas and three other experts around a panel table rather than a kitchen one on Tuesday night in an attempt to spark such conversations about economic policy, an issue that moderator Nina J. Easton termed “the great crisis of our time that we seem to forget is the crisis of our time.”
MacGuineas, who also serves as the director of the New America Foundation’s Fiscal Policy Program, was joined on the panel by Senator Mark R. Warner, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell International David M. Cote, and John “Vin” Weber, a former congressman and current economic adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Panelists focused on the importance of Democrats and Republicans uniting in Washington to fix current economic problems that plague the United States.
“Each [party] has the other by the throat,” Cote said, “and one is saying [the solution is] higher taxes and the other is saying it’s lower spending, and at the end of the day, it’s both.”
If Democrats and Republicans do not come together, panelists warned, the United States could face a second downgrade by ratings agency Standard and Poor’s before the 2012 elections.
After hearing the panelists’ exhortations toward bipartisanship, Hunter S. Fortney ’15 said, “It gives you hope that there are models on both sides that can compromise. The middle road is probably the golden road.”
But Weber noted that full cooperation is difficult to attain.
“You can’t hold out for a day when the two parties have no differences,” he said.
Many of the experts cautioned against leaving the deficit for a younger generation to inherit.
Warner expressed surprise that students do not discuss the deficit more frequently. “We’re leaving you with the bill,” he said, adding that policy makers should work to make fiscal issues more understandable to younger citizens.
“Bottom line,” MacGuineas said, “is we’re just spending a lot and not willing to pay for it and leaving it to our kids. It’s not much more complicated than that.”

Award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, and screenwriter Helen Whitney will give three speeches at Memorial Church for this year’s William Belden Noble Lectures series.
Whitney, who has written, produced, and directed more than a dozen documentaries, said that each installment of the lectures series will focus on one or two of her most controversial and inspiring films.
“Each night, I will discuss and present excerpts from my films covering different periods of my professional life,” Whitney said. “The bright thread uniting all of my work is my passionate interest in religious experience and my fascination in the lives of outsiders.”
“A life in film is a remarkable learning experience,” Whitney added. “It allows one to enter exotic landscapes rarely seen by civilians and to meet fascinating people. Inevitably, it broadens and deepens one’s moral and intellectual education.”
Whitney said that while her work, including a documentary on monks’ lives in monasteries and a biography of Pope John Paul II, focuses mostly on religious topics, she is also interested in depicting the challenges faced by marginalized groups of people. Her documentaries have covered topics ranging from gang violence to homosexuality to Mormonism.
Whitney said that her presentations at Memorial Church will start at the beginning of her career and continue chronologically.
“The lectures will cover my 40-year journey through film, focusing on my passionate interest in outsiders and coming to understand what these people have to teach us if we just listen,” she said.
Whitney will also discuss controversies which her works have sparked.
“My documentary ‘Youth Terror: The View from Behind the Gun’ explored the roots of juvenile violence. A number of cities throughout America refused to air it because of its graphic language and its scenes of violence,” Whitney said.
Whitney had embarked on a career n academia, completing a masters degree in Victorian literature at the University of Chicago, before she experienced what she described as “a sudden unexpected call to film.”
That summons was sparked by an encounter with Fred Freed, an ABC news executive who became a mentor to Whitney.
“[Freed] convinced me to put my plans aside for a year and go on the road with him as his researcher,” Whitney recalled. After that, she was hooked on filmmaking.
Epps Fellow at Memorial Church Nathaniel P. Katz said that he believes Whitney will bring a unique perspective to the lecture series as the only filmmaker who has participated in the series to date.
“This is a 21st-century approach and reflection of how religion is thought of, and it takes advantage of film and media and different forms of story-telling, which are very much in line with how religion is lived out today,” Katz said. “I think people who come will find themselves challenged intellectually, spiritually, and practically.”
Whitney said that she hopes that any aspiring documentary makers in the audience will walk away with a better understanding of the challenges and rewards of a career in film.
“There are special challenges for a filmmaker exploring the spiritual landscape. How does one illuminate spiritual themes, for instance? These challenges are invigorating, and the life of the filmmaker grappling with them can be profoundly humanizing, offering rare insights into the human condition,” she said.
The William Belden Noble Lectures were established in 1898 to “illustrate and enforce the words of Jesus,” but the topics of the series are “believed to be as wide as the highest interests of humanity,” according to the description of the bequest that funds the series.
Whitney will speak next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday at Memorial Church.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new fabrication technique for creating robotic insects crawled out of the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory this week.
The technique, which its creators say was inspired by children’s pop-up books and origami, is the latest development in the RoboBee project, which aims to produce autonomous robots about the size of a quarter.
The new method, which can create RoboBees in a day instead of a few weeks, sprung from frustration with the lengthy original process, which required engineers to individually assemble the robot’s separate components by folding, aligning, and securing them by hand.
The new process reduces the time required and removes the possibility of human error by incorporating techniques similar to those used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards. The 18 different layers of carbon fiber, titanium, and other materials that compose the Harvard Monolithic Bee—also called Mobee—are stacked and bonded together at once in a flat design.
When lifted by pins, an attached assembly scaffold pops up the flat structure into a 2.4-millimeter tall machine in under a second. The device is dipped into a liquid metal solder to lock the robotic joints and the scaffold is cut away, releasing the Mobee.
“It’s like you’re building two devices; one is your actual robot, and the other is a second robot that assembles the first robot for you,” said John P. Whitney, a SEAS research assistant who helped design the underlying manufacturing methods.
The fully automated process of building the RoboBee can now use a wider variety of materials and allows for the rapid production of clones of the micro-robots by the sheet.
The technology can be used in a variety of commercial applications, as the RoboBees can now be produced quickly by machines.
“Instead of having a skilled craftsman or artisan build one over the course of a week, this process really allows them to be mass-produced for the first time,” said Pratheev S. Sreetharan, a graduate student who led and designed the new process.
Sreetharan can trace the roots of the new method to an off-hand comment made by electrical engineering professor Robert J. Wood.
“Rob made a joke about making something that would function like a ship in a bottle. You’d stick it in, pull a string, and the whole thing would pop up,” Sreetharan said. “We all laughed about it then, but that’s the basic idea behind what we developed.”
For the researchers, seeing the first successful pop-up RoboBees was a vindication.
“It was exciting to see the first ones pop up,” said Sreetharan, “We sent an email saying that we could get all the parts in one set. Wood sent one back saying ‘Seriously? I thought that was 10 years away.’”
The new process has drawn much praise for its implications on micro-fabrication.
“Much like the way that integrated circuits changed the world of electronics, I believe this novel fabrication technique has the potential to open up a new era of discovery and advancement for micro-robotics,” said electrical engineering professor Gu-Yeon Wei.
Computer science professor J. Gregory Morrisett also lauded the laboratory, writing in an email to The Crimson that “Rob Wood (and his team) are geniuses.”
The process may be applicable to the design of micro-surgical devices, micro-sensors, micro-optics, and other integrated electromechanical devices.
The researchers are working to extend their process to integrate printed circuit boards into the mechanical structure of the robots.
Their new method will be featured in the March issue of the Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing the safety of AeroShot, an inhalable caffeine product manufactured by Breathable Foods, a company founded by a Harvard professor and led by a College graduate.
AeroShot, a thin plastic tube which delivers about 100 milligrams of caffeine—the same amount contained in one large cup of coffee—in six to eight puffs, hit the shelves of Massachusetts and New York stores last month.
The senator who led the charge against the caffeinated alcoholic drink Four Loko, which was popular at Harvard and other colleges before it was banned in Massachusetts and other states, says that Aeroshot may similarly enable young people to consume a dangerous brew of caffeine and alcohol.
The legislator, New York Senator Charles Schumer, has called on the FDA to review AeroShot.
“I am worried about how a product like this impacts kids and teens, who are particularly vulnerable to over-using a product that allows one to take hit after hit after hit, in rapid succession,” Schumer said, according to the Associated Press.
Pointing to advertisements for AeroShot, Schumer said, according to ABC News, “They’re not showing this with a lot of physics books, for late-night studying. They’re showing you at bars and parties, drinking. And that’s the danger.”
Breathable Foods, which is managed by CEO Thomas D. Hadfield ’08, labels AeroShot, which was invented by biomedical engineering professor David A. Edwards, as a dietary supplement. That designation allowed the product to reach the market without undergoing an FDA review.
In an interview with The Crimson, Hadfield said that AeroShot meets FDA rules.
“We think AeroShot is a healthier, safer, and effective way to consume energy and complies with FDA regulations,” Hadfield said. He said that early feedback on AeroShot from buyers has been positive.
“Sales of the product, since it launched in January, have been strong, especially in and around college campuses,” Hadfield said.
Hadfield said that Breathable Foods will work with the FDA as it conducts its inquiry.
“We will cooperate fully with the FDA review and are confident that it will conclude that AeroShot is a safe, effective product that complies with FDA regulation,” Hadfield said.

Tara Raghuveer ’14 sat across from her good friend, president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals James P. Fitzpatrick ’12, tapping her foot on the floor nervously.
Recently elected as an Undergraduate Council representative, Raghuveer, who is also a Crimson magazine writer, had just sent Fitzpatrick her first email on behalf of the UC.
Fitzpatrick, who said he does not think very highly of the UC, blinked at his laptop screen when he received the email.
“Tara, you have got to be kidding me,” he said.
But after reading the email, which introduced Raghuveer as the UC liaison to the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Fitzpatrick had no sarcastic remark to make.
In accordance with legislation passed in December, the UC has recently assigned each of its representatives to serve as a liaison to about ten student organizations. The initiative intends to give all of the student organizations on campus—more than 400 in total—a point person through whom they can communicate with the UC.
Mather House representative Seth A. Riddley ’12, who spearheaded this initiative, said that the idea was born while he was reaching out to student groups to seek their endorsements for a UC presidential campaign.
“It was great to be able to communicate with the students leading these organizations on a one-to-one basis,” Riddley said. “That’s when I first thought that we should do this normally, not just in the context of a campaign.”
Dunster House representative Delara Z. Alameddine ’14, chair of the UC Student Relations Committee, said that the liaisons will be available to answer groups’ questions about the UC and help organizations apply for funding offered by the Council.
“The most important thing is that they’ll be an advocate for the organization on the UC,” Alameddine said.
Carl Daher ’13, president of the Harvard College Lebanese Club, said that his group, which was recently recognized as an official student organization, has already found the new liaison program helpful.
“As a new student organization on campus, we weren’t very familiar with the great resources that the UC could offer us,” Daher said. “Our UC representative has answered all our questions about grants, publicity, and anything necessary to make our social and cultural events successful.”
UC representatives said that the liaisons will tout programs like UC Rooms and UC Taxis that might help student organizations plan events and other Council offerings like free speaker, projector, and camera rentals.
Reading about these services in Raghuveer’s email, Fitzpatrick found little reason to be skeptical.
“This is actually great,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Tuesday night, Jeremy Lin ’10 and his closest friends gathered in his Harvard dorm room to study the Bible. Listening to the economics concentrator dissect pre-selected verses and discuss how they could teach the assembled students to live better, it might have been hard to believe that Lin would one day become the face of one of the NBA’s proudest franchises.
Two years later, after that dream has come true, it is still tough for members of that Bible study group to realize that the 6’3” Taiwanese-American student they knew is now the newest star of the New York Knicks.
Who could expect Lin’s close friends Kai-Cheng Ho ’10 and Benjamin Wu ’10 to believe the headlines—when, after his first NBA start against the Utah Jazz, Lin talked with them until the wee hours of the morning about Ho’s work and community issues in China?
Even as Lin has emerged in recent days as an international superstar, he has stayed true to the friends and faith that helped get him to where he finds himself today.
FAITH AT HARVARD
Lin forged strong bonds with Wu at Harvard over their shared interest in video games. According to Wu, their game of choice was Defense of the Ancients, a real-time strategy game that pits two players against each other in a battle to destroy the other’s base.
“He was extremely competitive,” Wu said. “Besides his faith, besides basketball, DotA dominated a large portion of his time. It’s pretty hilarious, because you would imagine that he wouldn’t be sucked into these things, but that was a large drag on our free time. I think that just speaks to the kind of person Jeremy is, never indulging in what mainstream society would think a star basketball player would be like.”
Wu said that the two became closer during their senior year when Lin led their Bible study group. Every Tuesday, a group of 8 to 10 students gathered to learn about the Bible and about each other.
Beyond committing his Tuesday evenings to Christian education, Lin went to church near the Quad every Sunday morning. On Saturday, he would text Wu and others, reminding them to go to bed early so they could get their rest before waking up for church. On Sunday morning, Lin and Ho rounded up the others to head over to church together.
“Jeremy’s one of those guys who just never strayed,” Wu said. “He helped me find my motivation and inspiration to get up every Sunday morning and go to church.”
TWO YEARS OF TURMOIL
After Harvard, Lin spent two tumultuous years trying to make it as a professional basketball player.
He went undrafted and then had the chance to prove himself to the Mavericks in summer league play. When that team did not sign him, Lin joined the Golden State Warriors. During that time, he shared an apartment with his former Harvard roommate Eric Lee ’10.  Lee saw the fringe NBA player struggle firsthand.
“When times were tough, it just made him work that much harder,” Lee said. “It was a roller coaster ride. He was always plugging away, trying to outwork the next guy, trying to better himself.”
At its start, this season was only harder for Lin. He was waived by the Warriors on Dec. 11. Then after joining the Houston Rockets for a few days, he found himself without a team again by Dec. 24.
Shortly after Lin was picked up by the Knicks, he visited Ho’s apartment in New York.
“He was very discouraged,” Ho recalled of that meeting. “Everyone thinks NBA life is glamorous, but they don’t understand how challenging it is. Everyone was telling him what to do and what not to do. At that time, I thought this might not be the right path for him.”
To encourage Lin, Ho brought up the sensation of the moment, Tim Tebow.
“I mentioned to him that Tebow is a guy who had been through the same situation. He was someone who didn’t get enough playing time and then busted the seam—and everything he does is a credit to God,” Ho said. “I see a lot of similarities.”
Lin and his college friends talked for the rest of the night before crashing on couches at around 4 a.m. The next morning, Ho and Wu took Lin to the same church where the two had brought the fledgling NBA player when he was trying to get drafted and again when he signed with the Warriors. Perhaps the third time was a charm.
Still, it took another month of uncertainty and another stint in the NBA Developmental League before Lin’s shot at stardom came along.
KING OF NEW YORK
Wu sat down to watch the Knicks game on Feb. 4, as he had done every time the team played since his former classmate joined the squad just over a month earlier. Wu was hoping for a blowout so that Lin might get some playing time.
But for whatever reason, Lin came in early against the Nets on that Saturday night, and the rest is history. While Lin was dropping 25 points, seven assists, and five rebounds on an unsuspecting New Jersey team and a surprised world, Wu was just as shocked as anybody.
“I was ecstatic. I was going nuts in my own living room,” Wu said.  “It’s amazing what he did that game. I was texting him every five minutes saying, ‘This is crazy. This is nuts.’ I was shell-shocked.”
The amazement hardly subsided when the final whistle blew.
“Watching the highlights come up, everyone was talking about Jeremy Lin, and it was so surreal,” Wu said. “I couldn’t really believe this was happening. But I knew this was real, because we all knew he was capable of this. That’s his game.”
Halfway across the country, in Indianapolis, Ho was at an NFL party on the night before the Super Bowl and could not watch the Knicks game. When he saw someone at the party scanning NBA scores on his smartphone, Ho leaned over to ask how Lin was doing.
“He said, ‘He’s doing pretty well. He’s scored 19 points so far,’” Ho remembered. “When he said that, my eyes lit up. I was...screaming and jumping around. People thought I was crazy, psychotic. I was beyond thrilled.”
That night, Ho gave Lin a call and learned that the newest NBA hit was just as shocked as his two friends.
“He was extremely happy,” Ho said. “He was overwhelmed with everything at that time.”
Two nights after Lin’s breakout against the Nets, he got his first opportunity as a starter against the Jazz. Once again, he exceeded expectations, piling up 28 points and eight assists to secure his spot in the lineup.
But following the contest, it would be hard to tell that Lin’s life had changed irrevocably. He did not go out partying; he did not seek out media attention; and he declined to spend time with the celebrities who wanted to meet the new sensation.
Instead, Lin met with Ho and Wu, as he had done all through college. The three chatted outside of a Papaya Dog take-out restaurant until the wee hours of the morning—not about the fact that Lin was quickly taking the world by storm, but about Ho’s work with the NFL in China.
It was typical Lin, his friends said.
“It was never about him. The last thing he wanted to talk about was basketball or himself,” Wu said. “He wanted to hear about us.”
When Lee called Lin, he noticed, “Nothing’s changed. Our relationship is still very much the same. If I was living under a rock, I would have no idea this was going on by talking to him.”
Lin is changing the attitude on the Knicks—in New York, in Asia, maybe even the whole world. But the world seems not to have changed Lin a bit.
“Who you see in the media, the interviews, is Jeremy Lin,” Wu said. “This is who he is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 23, 2012, at 4:28 a.m.
Cambridge City Councillor Henrietta J. Davis was elected and sworn in as mayor of Cambridge just a few minutes after 8 p.m. at Wednesday's Cambridge City Council meeting.
The decision comes after weeks of failed attempts to select a new mayor. During the Council’s 10th ballot since the process began in January—the second ballot cast on Wednesday night—Davis garnered the necessary five out of nine councillors’ votes to earn herself the mayoral office.
“I’m very proud to be elected mayor of Cambridge,” said Davis after the meeting. “We have a lot of great things we’re going to do here, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to do them.”
Eight of the nine councillors sought the position, which is primarily ceremonial but comes with a significant pay increase and a spot on the Cambridge School Committee. Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, who was elected to the Council this past November, was the only councillor who never voted for him or herself.
On the first ballot of the night, Councillor E. Denise Simmons threw her support to Davis in what proved to be the turning point of the election.
“She has served with dignity and has done an extraordinary job on the school committee, so she asked me for my support, and I considered it, and there we are,” Simmons said.
Simmons had previously voted for Councillor Leland Cheung on every ballot since Jan. 9.
In the next round of voting, Councillors David P. Maher, Timothy J. Toomey Jr., and vanBeuzekom also realigned themselves behind Davis, giving her the five votes necessary to be elected mayor. After it was clear that Davis had won the election, Councillors Majorie C. Decker, Kenneth E. Reeves ’71, Craig A. Kelley, and Cheung switched their votes to Davis, giving her a unanimous victory.
VanBeuzekom was last in the Council’s alphabetical roll-call vote.
“I knew that it was momentous,” she said. “I was keeping track, and I had this big sheet­—she had four [votes], and I was going to be the fifth.”
Simmons, a former mayor of Cambridge, was elected and sworn in as vice mayor. Both terms last two years.
Wednesday’s council meeting was convened to discuss the ongoing budgetary issues of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which will be cutting back on service and increasing fares. Members of the Cambridge delegation in state government were present, including Representative Martha M. Walz.
Walz expressed disappointment with the way Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 has chosen to split up the budget.
“That is a judgement call with which I profoundly disagree,” said Walz, commenting on the funding allocated to the MBTA in Patrick’s proposed budget. “What the administration is saying is that we’re presenting two options and you can carry on, and so what we’re saying is that we need to have a third option.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With many teams starting theirs seasons and other hitting the championship grind, The Back Page decided to check in on how the teams are comparing with each other in this busy weekend in Harvard Athletics.
 
5. Men’s Tennis
The Crimson captured the ECAC title this past weekend in what has been a very strong February for Harvard, including wins over Virginia Tech and then No. 43 Vanderbilt. The team will have to wait until spring break for its next competition, when its heads to warmer climes to battle in the San Diego Tournament.
4. Women’s Swimming
After taking the HYP meet and Ivy League dual meet title two weekends ago, Harvard recently reached the summit of the CollegeSwimming.com’s Mid-Major Rankings. And after finishing second to Princeton for two consecutive years, the Crimson will look to knock the Tigers off their throne this weekend at the Ivy League Championships – because nothing is sweeter than sending Princeton on a long bus ride to New Jersey empty-handed.
 
3. Women’s Hockey
With the second seed in the ECAC secured, Harvard heads into the playoffs riding the momentum of a four-game win streak and the comfort of knowing it has home-ice advantage though the semifinals. And after powering 9 goals past Ivy rivals Brown and Yale this past weekend, the Crimson is looking to similarly go H.A.M. on the Tigers in the ECAC quarterfinals Friday.
2.Men’s Basketball
Brandyn Curry threw down his first career dunk over Greg Mangano as Harvard once again trounced Yale. With only four Ancient Eight games left, the Crimson are in pole position to take the Ivy League title on its way to March Madness. That is, as long as the squad doesn’t drop a home game to one of the Killer P’s as they roll through Cambridge this weekend. But considering the Lavietes win streak now stands at 27, Harvard has got to like its odds.
 
1. Men’s Squash
After reaching the semifinals of the CSA Team Championships this past weekend, Harvard found itself facing 13-time national champion Trinity. And despite the 6-3 loss to the Bantams, the Crimson bounced back to drop Cornell, 5-4, to win 3rd place in comeback fashion, as both junior captain Jason Michas and sophomore Brandon McLaughlin found themselves down 2-0 before battling back to 3-2 victories. And with the entire top nine rotation returning next year, things are only looking up for Harvard in 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a record-setting year for Harvard athletics.
Football broke the program’s modern-era points record. Barring a shocking collapse, the men’s basketball team will cruise past its previous team high of 23 wins. And Jeremy Lin ’10, well, he’s had more than his share of Harvard firsts this year.
But while impressive, those are school records, not national ones. So in that respect, the Harvard men’s hockey team did those squads (and JLin) one better.
Because on Friday, men’s hockey broke the NCAA D-I record for most ties in a single season with 11.
Eleven ties. That’s more than the team had in the past three years combined. The previous program record was six in one year.
Before the Crimson (8-8-11, 6-5-9 ECAC) made history, three teams sat at 10 ties: Minnesota State (2002-03), Colorado College (2008-09), and Western Michigan (2010-11). But no squad in the long and storied history of NCAA D-I hockey was able to attain that elusive number 11.
It must be the most boring record any team could break. No other honor exists, as far as I know, for being so remarkably average in so many games. It’s a record for being the Switzerland of the ECAC, for being the little train that stalled at the peak of the hill, for sitting smack on the top of that bell curve, right at the 50th percentile. Occupy Harvard must be delirious—someone really took the demands to leave the confines of the one percent to heart.
For those who mastered the virtues of sharing in kindergarten, for those who are radically moderate, for those who Santa has no clue what to do with—you were neither naughty nor nice—this record is for you.
And if a tie is like kissing your sister, then what is this? What Oedipus had going on? No, come on, that’s child’s play.
But what is interesting about this unprecedented, historic streak of ties is that they came for the Crimson in all shapes and sizes. In some, like the Jan. 21 tie against then-No. 9 Cornell, Harvard mounted a third-period comeback to force a draw. In others, like Friday’s 3-3 tie against Brown, Harvard held the lead until the waning moments but slipped coming down the home stretch, letting the Bears tie the contest with 1:46 remaining on the clock. A similar fate befell the Crimson the week before against Rensselaer.
And no Harvard opponent has been spared. The Crimson has tied them all, from Union, now ranked eighth in the nation, to Rensselaer, the doormat of the ECAC. Harvard firmly adheres to non-discriminatory tying practices.
Indeed, there have been good ties and bad ties, strong ties and weak ties, one tie, two tie, red tie, blue tie.
“I think you could look at it two ways,” said senior forward Alex Killorn after the Crimson tied Brown on Friday to set the all-time record. “A lot of those games we came back, and we showed a lot of resiliency…. A few of these games we’ve just given away. You don’t know how to feel about it. It’s a record…. But it’s a double-edged sword.”
It has been a strange year for the team. Paradoxically, Harvard has a middling offensive attack yet the nation’s best power play. After freshman goaltender Steve Michalek appeared to be the go-to guy between the pipes, there seems to be a revolving door in goal as of late. And if Saturday’s 7-1 loss, in which Michalek let in five goals on just 16 shots, is any indication, the Crimson may have a new starting netminder soon.
Yet despite it all, this season has exceeded expectations. Picked to finish dead last in the ECAC in one preseason poll, the squad sits at fifth place, just one point away from fourth and a first-round bye in the conference playoffs. Quite a turnaround from last year’s squad, which at one point was a dismal 4-18.
Depending on the team’s results this weekend  against St. Lawrence and Clarkson, the last two games of the regular season, the 2011-12 version of the Crimson could end a three-year spell of underperforming, sub-.500 seasons. And in some strange sense, it’s the ties that have gotten Harvard there. In 15 of 20 league contests, the Crimson has picked up at least one point, allowing the team to keep pace in the tightly-packed ECAC standings.
But with the impending start of the playoffs, a mid-life crisis looms for the Crimson. It’s do-or-die, no draws allowed, and so after a long, tempestuous relationship, Harvard has to kiss the tie goodbye. And then—gasp!—the Crimson will have to sink or swim. The floaties will have to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coaches of the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association (EISA) knew Harvard sophomore Rebecca Nadler had made history before she even finished the giant slalom course at Jiminy Peak in the Williams College Carnival.
“All the coaches were like ‘that’s it, race is over, she won,’” Crimson alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. “It was just one of those rare moments where you see an athlete take that step to the next level.”
When Nadler did cross that line it became official: She was the first Harvard alpine skier ever to win an EISA carnival event.
“I think it still sort of feels a little surreal,” the sophomore said. “I’m obviously really happy.”
Nadler’s win came on a challenging Jiminy Peak course that forces skiers to switch rapidly from steep slopes to flatter ground without losing speed, and the Ottawa native thrived in the challenging conditions.
Standing at five feet, Nadler does not have the leverage that many of her elite competitors have, but she makes up for it with aggression and superior technique.
“On a pretty steep course, that lower center of gravity really helps her take an aggressive line,” Mitchell said. “She can keep her skies pointed a little more down the hill.... On a steeper hill, a lot of people who maybe have some [technical] holes, stuff you could hide with strength and aggression, those flaws get a little magnified. She does not have a lot of holes in her technique.”
Mitchell attributes Nadler’s nearly flawless technique to a tireless work ethic and superior attention to detail in practice. The ski team travels up to southern New Hampshire to hit the slopes every morning, but class schedules often prevent the athletes from getting in as many runs as their EISA competitors. Yet Nadler’s mindset allows her to make important changes every run.
“She’s very good at focusing on the one of two tasks that we’re working on but not letting the rest of her skiing fall apart,” Mitchell said. “Her strong fundamentals really allow her to have a laser-like focus on the details.... She’s absolutely relentless.”
That kind of intensity in practice complements Nadler’s simplified mindset on race day.
“I was making mistakes here and there [at Jiminy Peak] but saying ‘don’t worry about it’,” she said.
“She’s got a very good perception of what works and what doesn’t,” Mitchell added. “She’s very, very insightful. She’s a very cerebral skier, but at the same time, come race day, she knows how to shut her brain off.”
Nadler’s calmness proved critical when a win in the first run of Friday’s giant slalom put her in an unfamiliar position.
“I’d never won the first run before,” she said. “I was really excited, but I had to keep my emotions in check.”
“She won the first run by like two-tenths of a second,” Mitchell continued. “So there’s a lot of pressure there. It’s very easy to ski cautiously and try not to lose.”
Nadler took the opposite approach and skied the second run with even more aggression to take the giant slalom title by over a second, which is a large margin in alpine skiing.
“Just with the momentum that Becca had been building, she would’ve had to have been held back with a crowbar to be kept from winning,” Mitchell said. “She skied a very, very aggressive line, skied with a lot of purpose.”
Nadler followed up her giant slalom performance with a third place finish in the slalom, her highest finish ever in the event.
“I think it’s a confidence thing,” Mitchell said. “She’s in a place when she says to herself ‘Every time I’m racing, I can win.’ You put yourself in that place enough times, you start to believe it. In slalom that’s huge because the rhythm is so much quicker.... You’re not looking for huge, huge improvements, just a couple of hundredths [of a second] each turn. One little, tiny tweak—that can pay dividends in a huge way.”
Nadler’s confidence has allowed her to take tighter turns on the slalom course and more aggressive lines on the giant slalom. And with two podium finishes in a weekend and Harvard’s first ever EISA win, the sophomore standout certainly has reason to believe.
“The higher my confidence is, the more fun I’m having, the better it is,” Nadler said. “I feel like it’s never perfect, but I’m really happy with how I’m advancing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team clinging to a one-game lead in the Ivy League standings, Crimson fans might have expected reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Keith Wright or former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Kyle Casey to come up big against Brown last weekend.
Instead, it was 220-pound freshman forward Steve Moundou-Missi who answered the call, leading Harvard to a 69-42 victory with 14 points, six rebounds, and four swats.
The Cameroonian has been an integral part of Harvard’s inside game this season, providing strong post defense and showing flashes of his athletic offensive skills. He has appeared in all 26 games for the Crimson and currently leads all Harvard rookies in points per game and minutes played per game.
But Moundou-Missi’s path to basketball has been a long one.
“At first, I didn’t like basketball because my parents played and I didn’t want to be like my parents,” Moundou-Missi said.
His father Jean Paul, who stands at 6’10”, and his mother Annette, who is 5’10”, both played basketball for the Cameroon national team.
“I always played soccer,” the freshman forward said. “It’s big in Cameroon. Growing up, I wanted to be a soccer player.”
Moundou-Missi, much like many of his fellow Cameroonians, fell in love at an early age with “the beautiful game” of soccer. A big fan of the Cameroon national team and its superstar Samuel Eto’o, Moundou-Missi admits to having a fierce passion for the game of soccer.
“Whenever I can afford to play [soccer], I do,” Moundou-Missi said. “Sometimes I even play with a basketball.”
The Yaounde, Cameroon native did not make the transition from soccer to basketball until a few years before he moved to the United States at age 16.
“I was introduced to basketball by my parents,” Moundou-Missi said. “They made me start playing basketball when I was 13 or 14. I attended camp in Cameroon...[and the coach there] was impressed. I made contact with the high school coach [at Montverde Academy in Montverde, Fla.], Coach Sutton, and that’s how I came to [the United States].”
It wasn’t an easy transition for a 16-year-old who had lived in Cameroon all his life and spoke little English to move to the United States. Moundou-Missi attended boarding school and stayed with a host family on weekends.
“It was hard at the beginning,” Moundou-Missi admitted. “It was hard to be around people and not be able to say things you want to say. As the years go along, you don’t get used to it, but you do integrate more.”
Moundou-Missi still believes that although he made the switch to basketball, soccer has stayed with him.
“I can say that soccer influenced the way I play the game of basketball by improving my footwork,” he said. “Also, soccer is quite a physical sport. I think I got tougher as I was playing soccer. I now use that physical toughness to play basketball.”
Ugo Okam, his teammate at both Harvard and Montverde, seems to agree.
Okam praised Moundou-Missi’s footwork and “ability to post up and be strong. He has strong legs.... I think it’s because he played soccer growing up.”
Attending boarding school away from his family and away from his home country was a challenge for the forward, but at Montverde Academy, Moundou-Missi quickly found success in both the classroom and the gym.
“In high school we had something like [a list of] the top 10 GPAs. He was always on it,” Okam said. “He’s always been this smart.”
At Montverde Academy, Moundou-Missi captained the men’s basketball team as a senior and earned several regional and national awards, including a selection to the ESPN Rise All-America second team. He led the Eagles to a second place finish at the 2010 ESPN National High School Invitational and was named Lake County Player of the Year as a senior.
Moundou-Missi has taken his success at Montverde with him to Harvard. Juggling a rigorous course load that includes Physics 15b: “Electromagnetism” and Applied Math 21b: “Mathematical Methods in the Sciences” while playing basketball for a Crimson team that has stayed consistently near the top 25 teams in the country is no easy feat.
“School comes first, basketball second,” Moundou-Missi insisted. “When everything is right in school, then I can play basketball. I knew that coming to college, that my biggest issue was going to be my time management. The first semester was really hard for me because I had to go to school, focus in school, get work done, and then go to practice.”
Moundou-Missi has found success in the Crimson rotation under the guidance of Tommy Amaker and a veteran-filled Harvard squad, averaging five points per game and 3.5 rebounds per game.
“I call him the silent assassin,” junior guard Brandyn Curry said. “He’s a quiet kid, well-mannered, but on the basketball court, he’s another animal.”
Okam agrees that Moundou-Missi is generally quiet, adding that his classmate has a hidden sense of humor.
“He has a funny side to him,” Okam said. “He will make fun of my jumpshot and joke. Steve’s a really funny character.”
When asked how he is able to manage such a busy schedule, Moundou-Missi points to organization and self-discipline.
“What motivates me is…I always think about why I’m here,” Moundou-Missi said. “I feel like going to another country, going to school, and playing basketball at the same time, I always feel like if I don’t play hard…this would be for nothing. That’s why I try my best. I don’t want to regret anything.”
A recipient of Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors after a stellar performance on Jan. 28, Moundou-Missi continues to play a big role for Harvard, as the team tries to clinch the Ivy League title and make a strong case for its first NCAA tournament bid since 1946.
“I think sports is one of those things that gets you outside of yourself,” he said. “Once you play a sport and you like it a lot, you just…don’t think about anything else except what you’re doing at the moment. I don’t think about homework, I don’t think about math, I don’t think about any girls I talk to. I’m just focused on what I have to do to make my team better. I would do anything to get it done.”

On Valentine's Day, the Atlantic Wire published a much-anticipated ranking of the hottest colleges, as determined by DateMySchool.com. How does the Crimson stack up?
An informal student survey revealed optimistic predictions about Harvard's standing, particularly within the Ivy League. "I'd say we're second," Peter H. Manges '15 speculated. "We're second or third, maybe after UPenn, maybe after Brown. Yale is hideous. Princeton's obviously at the bottom of the heap. I know some normal-looking people who go to Cornell."
Contrary to Manges' predictions, at number six, Harvard is below average among the Ivies. Harvard did, however, beat Yale, which placed in eighth (and last) place.
In the overall ranking, Harvard isn't a top performer, either. Fairleigh Dickinson University won overall with Montclair State University, Queens College, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania in the top ten. Harvard lagged behind in 56th place.
The methodology of this survey, however, is debatable, as schools are judged based only on the students who have created profiles on DateMySchool.com.
Thinking on the bright side, perhaps we're not worse looking than the 55 schools that walloped us, but rather just different looking.
Allison J. Sinofsky '15 reasoned that Harvard students exude a certain type of attractiveness. "[We're] more classy," Sinofsky said.
