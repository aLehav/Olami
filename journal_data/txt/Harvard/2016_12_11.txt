After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The new theme song for “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” unconvincingly denies both parts of the show’s premise that are discernible from its title. The protagonist’s “craziness” is refuted by a group of highly theatrical back-up dancers singing, “They say love makes you crazy / Therefore you can’t call her crazy / So when you call her crazy/ You’re calling her in love!” The “ex-girlfriend” part seems antithetical to the fact that, at the beginning of the second season, Rebecca (Rachel Bloom) is finally in a relationship with her ex-boyfriend Josh (Vincent Rodriguez III), which is reflected in her general state of blissful infatuation in the theme song.
Soon into the second season of the musical comedy, however, Rebecca once again finds herself in the position of the ex-girlfriend. The five episodes released so far of the show’s second season focus on letting Rebecca try to define herself independently of Josh (her ex-boyfriend, and for a brief moment in the second season, also current one) in what is an appropriately feminist pursuit, given the show’s constant cultural commentary that often focuses on issues of gender.
An essential part of the show’s goofy appeal is that it is also a musical. The second season definitely delivers there, and features numbers such as “Love Kernels,” a far more stylized song in comparison to the show’s usual replications of Broadway stereotypes. The black-and-white intro and visuals for “Love Kernels” seem inspired by Beyonc⚟⚟é’s “Lemonade.” Rebecca addresses the audience directly, saying, “This video ate up our production budget,” in an another example of the show’s light-hearted and entertaining self-awareness. The show’s classic Broadway form, however, is also very successfully explored in the Marilyn Monroe-esque “The Math of Love Triangles,” which follows the show’s common strategy of coming up with an inane pun, and pushing it to the extreme so it is truly funny. Another such example is “We Tapped That Ass,” a song performed by Rebecca’s exes Josh and Greg, where the butt of the joke is that while they singingly list all the places they had sex with Rebecca in her house, they are actually tap-dancing.
Although the “crazy” in the series’ title is a feminist appropriation of the term—another such appropriation, “bitch,” is even explicitly addressed in one of the episode—part of the joke is that Rebecca does have actual mental health issues. Despite often relying on caricature to satirize certain issues, the show laudably does allow its characters to make (or attempt to make) personal progress. Thus Rebecca does begin to realize that she is over-dependent on her romantic pursuits and that she is in fact deeply selfish. Another of the show’s strengths is the way it treats its decidedly uncool supporting characters—the second season sees Rebecca’s best friend Paula (Donna Lynne Champlin) finally deciding to go to law school and her boss Darryl (Pete Gardner) (mostly) maturely overcoming relationship issues with his boyfriend. This is indicative of the show’s ability to treat its characters with respect, rather than making them static exaggerations, which initially were amusing but would have grown tired if the show had continued to insist on them. The show also addresses a number of issues such as abortion or alcoholism without tragedizing them, to heart-warming yet not over-simplifying effect.
One of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s” very few flaws is perhaps occasionally its aesthetic—the domestic, overlit sitcom look is unavoidable in its non-musical sequences. Although that is probably a consequence of its reasonable budget, the show overcomes even that by ironizing it in its musical sequences. The truly crazy thing about “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” is that it even exists, given its eccentric combination of the medium and the message—the show is a social critique masquerading as a sunny musical.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not unusual to see crowds of students traversing Harvard’s campus on Friday nights, but typically everyone is clothed.
Hordes of students gathered in front of Hollis Hall at midnight on Friday wearing towels, flags, at the occasional bathing suit for Primal Scream, a biannual tradition at the College to ring in finals period. Runners arrived in winter coats and hats, keeping warm before dropping their clothes and running a naked lap around the Yard for the tradition. While last year’s fall Scream was unseasonably warm and drew a large crowd, this year’s “screamers” faced a crisp 25-degree night.
In typical fashion, the Harvard University Band stood in the center of the runners’ loop, playing fast-paced songs to match the pace of the “screamers.” As midnight neared, students chanted and cheered before sprinting past Mass. Hall, the John Harvard statue, and back to Hollis for their clothes.
“I went way too fast out of the gates,” Roger Jin ’18 said. “Then I got winded and slowed down a bit. I’ve never run this fast in my life.”
While tourists have attend the event in the past to snap pictures of Harvard undergraduates in all their glory, this year’s chillier weather conditions seemed to discourage onlookers.
“The experience was incredible,” Jacob Howell ’20 said. “It was much more enjoyable than I thought. Not as cold as I thought, either. Nowhere near as awkward as I thought—oh, and I’m also still pretty much naked.”
“Screamers” said the naked lap did its job of relieving stress and readying them for finals. A few groups of students paraded around Harvard Yard one or two more times after the group-run ended.
While the tradition consistently features students in the nude, one one occasion it saw controversy and protest. Two years ago, a Black Lives Matter protest disrupted the tradition, prompting runners to reverse their normal course around the Yard and College administrators to intervene in an attempt to quell the chaotic exchange.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a third-place finish in the Ancient Eight, 13 Harvard players earned All-Ivy nods, with senior defensive tackle James Duberg and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley ranking as unanimous selections.
Shelton-Mosley, offensive lineman Larry Allen, Jr. (junior), offensive lineman Max Rich (senior), and halfback Anthony Firkser (senior) all made the first-team offense. Duberg was the lone Crimson player on the first-team defense.
“The awards are the icing on the cake for all the work you put in,” Shelton-Mosley said. “I don’t think too many of us focus on the awards.”
Overall Princeton led the conference with 18 All-Ivy selections. Penn followed with 14, but the Quakers tied the Tigers with six first-team nods.
After leading the Ancient Eight with nine sacks and five forced fumbles, Dartmouth senior linebacker Folarin Orimolade took home Defensive Player of the Year. Meanwhile Princeton’s John Lovett—a do-everything junior who accounted for 31 touchdowns—claimed Offensive Player of the Year.
The 2016 season marked the first time since 2009 that neither award went to a Harvard player. Nor did the Crimson boast the Rookie of the Year or Coach of the Year. Those honors went to Big Green receiver Hunter Hagdorn and Tigers coach Bob Surace, respectively.
Ultimately Harvard’s 13 All-Ivy selections placed the team third in the conference.
After earning Rookie of the Year in 2015, Shelton-Mosley entered 2016 with high expectations. Mostly he fulfilled those hopes, topping Harvard with 48 receptions and 568 yards. That production came despite a lower-body injury that caused him to miss a game and eschew kick-return duties for much of the year.
“He’s great with the ball in his hands, and he has great ball skills,” said junior linebacker and 2017 captain Luke Hutton. “We’re going to need more from him every single year that goes by.”
Meanwhile Duberg, a fifth-year senior, headed a defensive line that held three of its final four opponents to under 100 yards rushing. Individually Duberg racked up four-and-a-half sacks and 29 tackles. This postseason marked the third straight one in which he made an All-Ivy team.
Seven of Harvard’s 13 All-Ivy players came from defense. Senior defensive back Raishuan McGhee, junior linebacker Luke Hutton, and sophomore defensive end DJ Bailey all made the second team.
Bailey especially had a breakout year, recording nine tackles for a loss and a team-high seven sacks. The sophomore had not held a starter’s role before this season. Neither had Hutton, or McGhee. Nor had freshman Jake McIntyre, a second-team kicker.
“The main goal for us every season is to go 10-0,” Hutton said. “An award can give an additional benefit… In a few years down the road, I’m sure it will be pretty cool to show your kids.”
By contrast, Rich, Allen, Jr., and Firkser—the three non-unanimous selections to the first team—had played major roles before 2016. Rich and Allen Jr. had started in 2015, and Firkser had earned second-team honors as a sophomore and junior.
Four Harvard players took home honorable mentions. Sophomore wide receiver Adam Scott belonged to this group. Despite playing only five games, the speedster finished third on the team with 321 receiving yards, including a 109-yard showcase against Columbia.
On defense, captain and cornerback Sean Ahern also earned an honorable mention, bucking two straight years of first-team appearances. A shoulder injury kept Ahern out of the last four games, but the fifth-year senior still topped the Crimson with eight pass breakups.
Joining him as honorable mentions were senior defensive lineman Langston Ward and junior defensive back Tanner Lee.
More than half of Harvard’s All-Ivy crew will return for next season, including first-teamers Shelton-Mosley and Larry Allen, Jr. These players will look to improve on a 7-3 campaign that shattered two historic streaks—three straight Ivy League titles and nine straight wins over Yale.
Already preparations for next season have begun. After the loss to the Bulldogs, Shelton-Mosley took off a couple weeks for the sake of rest and recovery. But last Wednesday he has resumed his weight-training regimen.
As Harvard coach Tim Murphy likes to remark, football players train 300 days for the sake of 10 games. Those 300 days of preparation start now, in the depths of December.
“For me I want to do anything possible to help our team win,” Shelton-Mosley said. “The goal is to go 20-0 the next two years and win Ivy League championships.”
