After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BETHLEHEM, the West Bank—Near one of the largest Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank, a shop sells postcards with photographs of the separation wall. In one of the pictures, the English phrase “TO EXIST IS TO RESIST” is painted on the Wall.
Just a kilometer away, in downtown Bethlehem, we watch tourists pour out of buses. They are Christian pilgrims, here to visit religious sites like the Milk Grotto, where a drop of milk that fell from the Virgin Mary’s breast turned an entire cave white. We walk into a small store in the downtown market, or souk. The store’s name in English is simply “Nativity Shop”: it is located near the Nativity Church, on the land where Jesus was born. The church is now a major tourist site, at least for those who don’t mind going through a checkpoint to get here.
The owner of the shop is a friend of a friend, so we linger to talk to him about his business, the city, and the weather. He asks me my religion. Cautioned not to tell Palestinians that I am Jewish, I say, “I’m just American.” But here in the Holy Land, religion is of utmost importance; the shop owner presses me for an answer. Eventually, I admit that I am Jewish.
His face breaks into a grin. Handing me a cup of Nescafé, he informs me, “Jewish people are always so shy! If I didn’t want Jews in my shop, I would not sell these!”—he dangles some Magen David charms in front of my face—“or these!”—he shows me some small metal Menorahs.
Later that day, we run into the shop owner again in a restaurant. He pulls me over to the table where he is sitting with two older men in suits, maybe having a business conversation. “This girl,” he asks them, pointing at me, “What do you think she is? Italian? Something else?” “Italian,” nods one. “I don’t know,” says the other.
Leaning back, the store owner shares a smile with me and laughs, pleased. “No! She is American.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chief Justice John Roberts’ decision to preserve the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate because it resembles a tax does more than clarify the constitutionality of health reform. It sheds light on his decision-making paradigm and offers more interesting questions concerning how he will vote on future cases. Previously, Roberts has characterized the role of a judge as one of fair and unbiased mediation, but he has nevertheless consistently voted in step with the right wing of the court. His opinion on the Affordable Care Act reveals a desire on his part to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. However, it leaves open the question of whether he may merely be attempting to set the legal groundwork for the dismemberment of future regulatory and social welfare programs.
Roberts’ vote to preserve the individual mandate reveals his keenness to dispel allegations that the Supreme Court practices partisan politics—an extension of the ‘humble’ persona he has cultivated during his tenure. When speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation process, Roberts characterized his role as being comparable to an umpire: “The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules.” However, he also noted that “Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize that they operate within a system of precedent.” When he voted with the majority to limit the powers of the McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Act, Roberts was careful to be relatively narrow in his opinion, rather than making generalizing claims of the sort made by Justice Scalia about the First Amendment’s protections of “speech, not speakers.”
New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin noted that Roberts’ record of writing opinions like these, which avoid bombastic language and speak largely in terms of precedent and narrowness of judicial power, is not evidence “of a humble moderate but, rather, that of a doctrinaire conservative. The kind of humility that Roberts favors reflects a view that the Court should almost always defer to the existing power relationships in society.” However, Toobin’s illustration of Roberts’ ‘humility’ can be expanded. Instead of speaking in terms of power relationships, which are obviously political, Roberts chooses to speak in terms of deference. In this way, he avoids the appearance of partisanship on the bench of the court. But, when Roberts wrote his opinions concerning corporate influence in elections, gun regulation, and affirmative action, he chose not to include empathy as a judicial tool of equivalent importance to humility—hence his appearance as a “doctrinaire conservative.”
However, Roberts’ opinion on the Affordable Care Act cannot be said to be as obviously “doctrinaire” as those he has written for prior cases. It doesn’t easily pair up, on the surface, with the opinions of his fellow conservative justices and doesn’t merely differ on details of interpretation, as his past ones have. Roberts once again wrote in terms of humility and deference, acknowledging that “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.” Although the mandate appears to be written as “a command under the Commerce Clause,” Roberts notes, it can still be read as “establishing a condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a tax” and that since “the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.” The question remains as to why Roberts is choosing to vote this way. Is it merely to save the endangered image of the Supreme Court? Is it still subtly “doctrinaire,” attempting to preserve “power relationships” by decreasing Congress’ power to pass regulation under the Commerce Clause?
In a 2005 article, law professor Jeffrey Rosen noted how decreasing Congress’ authority to regulate under the Commerce Clause has been part of a conservative commitment to the “Constitution in Exile,” an effort to decrease regulation to the level that existed prior to the New Deal. Rosen cites John Roberts’ behavior as a federal judge, when he questioned the regulatory power of the Endangered Species Act, as possibly evidencing his belief in the “Constitution in Exile.” Reporter Lyle Denniston notes that Roberts’ language may be suggesting to Congress that, “if it can muster the votes to pass new laws to improve the social welfare of America, it might be better advised to create new cultural obligations that can be enforced under the tax code.” Until a future case concerning regulatory power gained under the Commerce Clause comes before the court, it may be too early to tell if decreasing such power is truly why Justice Roberts ruled the way he did,
When Barack Obama, as a Senator from Illinois, voted against Roberts’ confirmation as Chief Justice, he stated that he was confident Justice Roberts would decide ‘correctly’ on cases 95% of the time. In the other 5% of cases, he observed, “Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision… the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge’s heart.” I hope that Chief Justice Roberts’ recent decision is evidence of his ongoing transformation from a cold and detached justice into an empathetic one, with a heart of gold. However, I’m not holding my breath.

STONE HARBOR, New Jersey—In the mornings we drift out to the patio as each of us wakes up. Knees curled up under us, coffees in hand, we field questions from aunts and uncles on school and summer plans. We talk about the family: a cousin’s lacrosse tournament, another’s bad grades, an uncle’s new job. Eventually we veer back to previous years at the Shore. When was it that we lost Aidan for a day? we ask each other. What year did the drawling Southern second cousins join us? We make halfhearted attempts at unraveling the years, distinguishing them into separate weeks, separate times. It is futile, though: the rental houses and beach days splice together in a mass of hazy memories.
When we were younger it was the vacation we looked forward to all year. We crammed the car with suitcases, coolers, badminton sets, groceries, only a slot left for Mom to see out the back. Every step of the two-hour trip we recorded in diaries, from the corn and cows to the first sight of sand. Crossing over to the island, that flat long stretch, tightened our almost painful knots of anticipation.
When we were younger there were still few enough of us to rent just one house. A bedroom each for the sisters and their husbands; for the cousins, a fleet of Aerobeds bobbing up and down through the house. If we woke up early we were faced with a tangle of arms and feet to maneuver around, to reach the cereal, before the rest of the house began slowly to stir and awake.
The four sisters and little brother had been coming for years. They waitressed at Uncle Bill’s Pancake House, worked from seven am till one and then went to the beach, then to the bars when the drinking age was still 18.
We, their oldest girls, the four oldest cousins, reigned over a sea of scrawny boys. We organized talent shows and lemonade stands and sand castle construction sites.  We saved up all our money for water ice in town. We went out in the ocean further than allowed, disdaining the lifeguards in the years after we looked up to them, in the years before they were our crushes.
When did the Shore lose its sun-hazy mystique? This year we drive across the bridge and through town, by the kitschy ice cream shops and bikini-baring preteens. We rent two houses now, some of us having become too big to sleep on the floor: one still loud and wild but the other for the older kids, more quiet and subdued. The meals are still raucous affairs for thirty, plus maybe a stray classmate or boyfriend joining in for the weekend. But after the weekend some of us peel off, older now and with summer jobs or other plans.
The boys are older this year, and we are almost shocked to find they have their own personalities, their own selves. You’ll come here with all your kids, the aunts tell us. We smile at the remoteness of it, but it also makes us sad. Maybe because we begin to understand: before coming home again, we first must drift away.

BANGKOK, Thailand — Oh, dear.
I’ve committed the cardinal sin of office etiquette. And I couldn’t be happier about it.
When out to lunch with a few coworkers, one of the girls from my office flounced her hair and asked, smilingly, “notice anything different?” I don’t know if I was too distracted fighting for my spot in line or digging for a ฿20 note, but I made the unforgivable mistake of shaking my head “no”—I had not noticed her haircut.
Though five minutes later we were laughing at someone’s wild clubbing tale (it involved a broken elbow), the mistake had not been forgotten. As of that moment, I was no longer the farang in an all-Thai office, welcomed and helped by an incredibly friendly group of people who tried their hardest to pretend that it was not uncomfortable to have to switch to English for exactly one person in a 150-person company. By committing a minor, completely normal social faux pas and seeing the reaction I would expect from one of my American friends, I—and she—realized that I had ceased to be “different.”
There is an inherent awkwardness in being the only intern at any company, but when you add to that a very major language barrier and being (half) a world away from almost everyone you know, it seemed that even if I loved my work, normal camaraderie might never be possible. Though by no means do I blend in, I'm now a unique part of others' lives rather than a tourist superimposed onto their week.
That moment helped me to realize how easy it is to feel at home. Just as I would in any other city, I eat, sleep, work, go to synagogue. A modern transportation system whizzes me and some friends to one of the giant, air-conditioned behemoths that is a Bangkok mall. The pull of a lazy Sunday often tries to tempt me away from touring this new, beautiful, fascinating place, as it would in any place that I call home.
Curiously enough, the most different part of my life here is the only thing I do with other people “like me”—visitors and expats, temporarily or permanently in the Land of Smiles. At Thai-language school it is painfully clear that we are all foreigners, struggling through the simplest phrases that any Thai three-year-old has mastered. It’s an interesting group — businessmen, retirees, teachers, drifters—with one thing in common: we’ve made a home here. Regardless of differences in look, in culture, or in language, people are more similar than they are different.

PARIS, France—Sometimes I feel like such an American in Paris. Whether it’s when asking for directions or not being able to open the door to exit the Metro, it’s taken me a bit of time to get used to the pace of this city (not to mention the pace of the language). Nevertheless, there is no doubt that there is something magical about these streets, where great minds like Picasso, Hemmingway, and Einstein found inspiration.
There is a definite artsy, intellectual vibe present in Paris. Of course, it’s obvious in areas like Montmartre, littered with artists begging to draw your portrait and street musicians playing the violin for a few Euros—but it is also present in the culture of everyday life. Last night was Fête de la Musique, a huge party in the streets of Paris where professional and amateur musicians alike play all night for free. One either takes the Metro or walks from one pocket of the city to the next, pausing to listen to a jazz singer at a café or a Swiss rock band performing in three languages. It was just another example of the vibrant nature of this city.
While I definitely don’t feel like a local here, I’m beginning to assimilate to the Parisian lifestyle. I eat a lot of baguettes, a lot of cheese. I wear a trench coat. I go to the Musée d’Orsay after class. Even without the Eiffel Tower in view, the spectacular feeling of just walking through the streets, lined with khaki-colored buildings and perfectly-pruned streets, never ceases to impress me. I am happy here, and it is easy to see why.

ROME, Italy—The first time I laid eyes on Gianlorenzo Bernini’s sculpture The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, all I could think was: “I want that.” Even in black and white, flat on a page in an outdated art history book, I could tell she was experiencing something unearthly. And it was good.
Recently, I had the privilege of seeing the work in person during a class trip to Rome. Bernini is depicting a scene of a 16th-century nun, Saint Teresa, in which her spirit is overcome by “the great love of God,” which causes a pain so extreme “that one cannot possibly wish it to cease.”
In person, it appears as if every part of her body is caught in tension, suspended between tautness and relaxation. Her fingers and toes are captured in a moment that makes it difficult to decipher whether she is inhaling or exhaling out of pure pleasure. But it’s the way her eyes are fluttered half-shut, the way her head is thrown back as she lifts her mouth gasping for (or exhaling) air that emote a pure sensation of ecstasy, of pain so penetrating that it results in pleasure.
Her body, under the control of both divine intervention and her primordial instincts, is contrasted with the angel’s sweet face and soft smile. He delicately balances his arrow (was it just pulled out, or is it going in?) between his fingers with his left hand as his right lifts her voluminous shroud.
In this work the primitive and divine are reconciled, the private and public spheres become one, the heavenly and earthly come together bridging impurity and holiness. For religious reasons, my entire life I’ve been told to steer far from desiring such gratification. But here, in a sanctuary, I found pleasure at its extreme, its most beautiful. Saint Teresa writes she was experiencing the Holy One, but what Bernini captures is nothing less than human.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates—Laila seemed to think Americans only travel to take pictures. The nanny of my Dad’s business colleague, she was given the task of showing me around during my 20-hour layover in Dubai. I arrived ready to take in every cultural and historical site possible. Laila was committed to helping me snap pictures of it all: the perfect travel team.
The only flaws in the plan were that I don’t particularly enjoy taking pictures and that Dubai doesn’t really have too many cultural or historic sites. Dubai is famous for being new, large-scale, and extravagant—the place where everything carries a superlative: the world’s tallest building, biggest aquarium, largest mall, most decorative artificial islands, only seven-star hotel (self-proclaimed, of course, since hotels are graded on a five-star system). Not exactly the foray into Middle Eastern history that I had hoped for, but a new frontier nonetheless.
Laila took me to the mall, to the ski slope inside the mall. She took me to another mall, which enveloped the world’s largest aquarium, an ice-skating rink, and a fountain. We rode in cabs to iconic buildings and gazed at them from the outside but only for long enough to nab a quick picture, lest we melt from the reverberating heat. Click click click. I snapped blurry, off-center photos at her suggestion.
But when I look back on Dubai, I will remember the thick shimmer of makeup on the faces of the Emirati women who floated along the polished mall floors, their flashing eyes stark against their hijabs. I will remember the off-tempo, incessant blinking of mini lights that were wired into the trees to make artificial stumps appear to glimmer in the moonlight. I will remember the wide, empty streets that lay naked and exposed, stripped of bustling human life by 110-degree heat.

PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania—When I heard that I would be working in Pittsburgh this summer, I expected factories. My conception of the city as a dreary place was reinforced by friends: “Pittsburgh? Eww..” I soon found that these assumptions were wildly inaccurate. Instead of smokestacks, I was greeted by neo-medieval architecture and an eccentric cultural atmosphere.
On my way to work, I pass by the towering red brick Epiphany Catholic Church, which lies on the outskirts of the downtown area. Inside, beautiful stained glass windows soar over the main hall, reflecting rainbow colors across the pews and altar. As I turn the corner, I walk beneath a replica of the Venetian “Bridge of Sighs” linking the county courthouse to a quaint stone prison. Some businesses even add turrets to their office buildings, blurring the borders between the municipal and commercial parts of Pittsburgh.
When I get lunch at noon, bands play jazz and cover Jackson 5 songs outside. Locals crowd around a book exchange while humming along to “I Want You Back.” The streets are populated with public art displays, like “Farley’s Robot Repair Shop,” an homage to 1950s sci-fi aesthetic. Last week, I saw people walking around wearing furry tails and bunny ears. I soon found out that Pittsburgh is home to Anthrocon, the world’s largest convention of “furries.”
Obviously, the city needs a new nickname. “City of Steel” just doesn’t cut it anymore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Experiment Fund, a seed-stage venture capital firm started at Harvard, announced on Tuesday that it will form partnerships with Polaris Venture Partners, Accel Partners, and Breyer Capital.
“I hope that we can make a real difference in the entrepreneurial ecosystem as well as create some really outstanding companies that make a difference in people’s lives,” said Alan L. Crane ’86, a partner at Polaris.
Launched by School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray in January, the Experiment Fund, also called the Xfund, is meant to foster entrepreneurship at Harvard and other colleges in the Boston area. Patrick S. Chung ’96, a partner at the Experiment Fund and former Crimson editorial chair, explained that while Harvard may prepare its students for a variety of professions, it often does not provide proper support for entrepreneurship.
"Every student who wants to start a company and gets sucked into Wall Street is a Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg who is lost forever," Chung said.
Jim Breyer, a partner at Accel and the founder of Breyer Capital, was unavailable for comment.
Since the Experiment Fund’s launch, Chung said, the organization has received about 750 business proposals. This interest from aspiring entrepreneurs was matched by investors.
"We were in the very privileged position to have interest from almost every top-tier investor out there," Chung said. "And we were in the very humbling position of getting to choose who to work with."
According to Chung, Breyer was chosen for his 2005 angel investment in Facebook, as well as his association with Accel Partners. Crane was picked because of his association with the venture capital firm Polaris, which Chung said was especially attractive because of its presence in the Boston area.
In addition to the new partners, the Experiment Fund has brought on several advisers, including former Harvard Law School professor John G. Palfrey ’94 and Facebook co-founder Andrew K. McCollum ’06.
“[Palfrey]’s been an amazing supporter to faculty and staff, which are very important to us,” Chung said.  “With Andrew, we have one of the Facebook founders—he provides such an immediate role model to other Harvard students and Boston area-students.”
New advisers will also include startup adviser Hugo Liu and the current president of Harvard Student Agencies, Kirk W. Benson '13. Chung explained that the latter position, an ex officio post, is crucial for keeping the Experiment Fund connected to student life in Cambridge.
"Every single year, this campus and this area generates a totally new crop of amazing entrepreneurial talent," Chung said.  "When that happens, we want someone in the Xfund who has her finger on the pulse, so we don't become a bunch of crusty old guys who are totally out of touch."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The intercollegiate rowing season ends with the IRA national championships in early June, but perhaps the most prestigious annual competition that the Harvard crews compete in concluded Sunday, across the pond at the Henley Royal Regatta on the River Thames in England.
The Crimson men’s heavyweight 1V captured the Ladies’ Plate by beating the British Leander Boat Club by one foot in a sprint to the finish. The win marked the second in three years for Harvard and the eighth all-time. It also rounded out the 50th season of Crimson coach Harry Parker’s tenure at the helm of the heavyweights.
Leander led for nearly the entire race before a furious sprint propelled Harvard to victory in the final 50 meters of the course. The winning time of 6:33 was a full 30 seconds faster than the fastest time in qualifying, a 7:06 time by the Crimson in the semifinal on Saturday. Patrick Lapage ’12, Matthew Edstein ’12, Sam O’Connor ’12, and captain Mike DiSanto ’12 capped off their Harvard careers with their second Ladies’ Plate trophies. Rising seniors James O’Connor, Parker Washburn, and David Fuller (coxswain) and rising juniors Caspar Jopling and Andrew Holmes rounded out the eight-man boat.
Three other Crimson/Radcliffe boats reached at least the semifinals of various competitions at Henley, with the national champion Harvard lightweights falling in the Temple Challenge Cup, the Crimson heavyweight four losing out in the Prince Albert Challenge Cup, and the Radcliffe heavyweight eights also bowing out in the penultimate race of the Remenham Challenge Cup.  The freshman men’s heavyweight eight lost in the quarterfinals of the Temple Challenge Cup.
Chris Kingston ’11 coxed his new crew, the Star Club, to victory in the Britannia Challenge Cup, and rising senior Josh Hicks rowed for the Australian U-23 boat, coming home with a victory in the Stewards’ Challenge Cup. Rising junior Andrew Campbell advanced to the semifinals of the lightweight sculls.
