After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Driving in Texas is a way of life more so than a means of transportation. Massive parking garages are attached to every high-rise building. Drivers avoid the rush-hour-infected roads of 4:30 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. like the plague. Cruising down the 26-lane stretch of Interstate 10 in Houston at midnight is a rite of passage.
Driving through Texas also comes with an interesting bonus: a front-row seat to America’s political spectrum.
In big cities, Beto and Biden bumper stickers on Subarus drive alongside Blue Lives Matter ones on Ford F-150s. Rural areas just outside the city are dotted with flags boasting the bold letters “TRUMP WON,” while urban areas display rainbow ones to show their support of the BGLTQ community. Colorful murals that celebrate ethnic diversity and the stories of immigrants decorate the sides of buildings in El Paso. Over 180 Confederate statues and other symbols dot the Texas landscape.
I have always known the South is not a political monolith, even though different parts of it definitely skew certain ways. But I did not ascribe the same level of nuance to the North. I, like many northerners inversely assume about the South, believed that New England was as seamlessly deep blue as the electoral college map suggests.
I was driving through South Easton, just outside of Boston, in the fall of 2020. My parents and I were staying in a friend’s house before moving me into my freshman dorm room. And that’s when I saw it: a little brick-and-mortar corner store with a bright blue and white “TRUMP 2024” flag waving on its facade.
It seemed so out of place, so disjointed with my naive perception of what Massachusetts looked like. Much of what I thought I had left behind in Texas had followed me here. Many little examples like that have punctuated my time in this city — seeing the infamous pro-Trump caravan parade through Boston in the fall of 2020; learning that Governor Charlie Baker is a Republican. The more and more I live in Boston, the more I see that being a “blue” state does not mean your people are politically homogeneous anymore than being a “red” state does.
This is not a new revelation. Five minutes studying the New York Times Electoral College map, with its muted shades of blue directly adjacent to soft red counties, points you to the same conclusion. But, in a society that places more emphasis on a 280-character tweet or a 15-second TikTok than the people directly impacted by certain issues, we have become conditioned to simplify. Simplification in politics comes in the form of treating entire groups of people or geographical areas as homogenous.
When the South is painted as a political monolith, many classify it as a place beyond help. Writing the South off as a dystopia when certain laws are passed, such as Senate Bill 8 in Texas, does a tremendous disservice to all the activists working behind the scenes. It writes off activists living in proximity to the communities they are trying to help, not comfortably removed in the fancy office of a New York City think tank. Those activists have not given up on their communities, and they are the ones actually doing the work. Lend your energy in support of them instead of painting a place you do not live in as unsalvageable or a fool’s paradise.
When the North is painted as a blue monolith, people in the South grow even more jaded towards its “sheep-like behavior” (you don’t know what’s in the vaccine!), which then causes the North to see the South as ignorant (just get the vaccine!), which further pushes the two regions apart.
When politics (and oftentimes morality) are simplified into two broad categorizations, the contoured stories and beliefs of everyday people get lost in a machine more interested in cranking out colorful infographics than listening to impacted communities. Individual stories and experiences are what ultimately matter, not catchy political soundbites.
The South and the North are not politically homogeneous, which means that individual stories need to be valued more than group-based political identities, identities many Americans regard as fundamental truths. But in that conclusion comes the question: if each person holds beliefs worthy of acknowledgment, does this mean that no one can ever say a political opinion is wrong?
Not necessarily so. I believe political truth is not found within the stereotype-driven and politically motivated categorizations that ground the biases of Americans, but in engaging with impacted communities and letting their experiences challenge and change your own social and political predispositions. Forego the algorithm-induced echo chambers and participate in discussions that force you to listen and only listen. Striving for truth means being in company with those who are proximate, armed with a mind poised towards understanding and not prejudice, saviorism, or pride. You should enjoy being proven wrong — it means you’ve knocked off a false truth.
The South or North are not political monoliths. To find political truth, we need to stop treating them as such.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has used the Covid-19 pandemic to quietly cancel many longstanding University traditions. While shopping week was one of the more obvious cases, Harvard is now doing the same thing to Dorm Crew by eliminating the Fall Clean Up and the term-time job of cleaning bathrooms. Even worse, Harvard has not committed to bring them back for future semesters, leaving the program’s existence in doubt. Dorm Crew’s work is an important opportunity for students to work, learn, and earn, and Harvard should not try to sweep it under the rug.
Dorm Crew started in 1951 as a student employment and federal work study program for helping with various maintenance and housekeeping tasks around the Harvard campus, with the cleaning of student bathrooms among the largest of its operations. The program has continued for nearly 70 years, with many students signing up and taking advantage of the great $16.25 hourly pay and flexible scheduling that allows them to work without class or school work conflicts, all while learning good maintenance skills.
However, while the service was understandably suspended when Covid-19 sent everyone packing in March 2020, the University suspended Dorm Crew’s Fall Clean Up, bathroom cleanings, and all other maintenance work in the fall semester. Dorm crew leaders report that they were not consulted about the semester-changing decision. Spring Clean Up remains in doubt as well, with little direct communication from the administration.
Fall Clean Up and other maintenance has fallen on top of the regular duties for Yard and House staff. Students across the Houses have been given their own, less robust cleaning supplies to clean their bathrooms for the semester. Harvard left almost all of Dorm Crew’s employees without work, leaving little time to scramble and find new jobs for the semester.
While some of Harvard’s decision could be justified as Covid-19 precautions, it makes little sense when the University has a vaccination rate of 95 percent and has now shifted to thrice-a-week testing. Even then, hoping all the University’s students will be motivated enough to regularly clean their bathrooms with less effective equipment seems like a backwards way of trying to ensure Covid-19 cleanliness. Requiring Dorm Crew members to test at least one day before a shift would mitigate their risk of spreading the virus and would be well worth any sacrificed flexibility.
Suspending Fall Clean Up and leaving Spring Clean Up uncertain is imprudent for the same reasons, and both were also the largest operations of Dorm Crew. They were even more pivotal to the department’s existence than its term-time bathroom work due to the operation’s large scale and its importance to the University's semester changeover. The clean ups were a crucial juncture where some members were trained to become captains for the next semester, learning skills in managing crews of people and monitoring tasks.
Through all of its work opportunities, Dorm Crew not only provided well-paying jobs, but also cultivated a strong community and taught many leadership skills through hands-on experience. However, Harvard decided to ignore the needs of its student workers and push ahead with these shortsighted changes.
If this were simply a matter of fiscal austerity, it would still be frustrating but at least more understandable. However, it is hard to separate this decision from the shadow of prior, unfair controversies surrounding Dorm Crew. In 2019, a Temple University professor tweeted “Low-income students at HARVARD working 20 hours a week in their first year of college cleaning goddamn dorms??” without any attribution or proof of its accuracy. It was then followed up by an article and a magazine feature in The Crimson that used anecdotes that cast doubt on the program, even though many Dorm Crew members pointed out how the tweet was a gross mischaracterization.
Waging a war of anecdotes is unhelpful, but the concern points to a problem not with the program but with the travails low-income students face at the University. If there are people who feel forced into taking on extra work, then that speaks more to Harvard’s failure to accommodate and assist low-income students than it does to anything about Dorm Crew. Canceling the service will only rob students of one of the best-paying and most flexible campus jobs, worsen the underlying problems for low-income students, and ignore disparities that Harvard could do a lot more to fix.
Dorm Crew provided a much-needed avenue for students to work on their own time and earn money without interrupting their school schedules — a rare opportunity on campus. To quietly cancel it without enough consultation from the students involved is shortsighted and duplicitous. Regardless of whether the decision stemmed from fiscal convenience, Covid-19 precautions, a misinformed view of student conditions, or even a desperate attempt to save face, the University should not end or suspend a helpful, decades-old tradition with so little remorse and consideration for its student workers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mental health struggles aren’t scheduled or neatly planned, but are often urgent. So we have reason to look favorably upon a new Harvard initiative which acknowledges that emotional turmoil can’t always adhere to regular business hours and seeks to fill gaps in care.
Earlier this summer, Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services announced a promising extension of its programming: A brand new, 24/7 hotline. Through it, students can reach a licensed counselor for reasons large or small, any time of the day. The program owes its creation to the generosity of Anita Gajdecki, the parent of a current College student who gave a donation to support the 24/7 hotline for five years.
We welcome both the hotline and the donation that enabled it. It could serve as a reliable resource for students attempting to re-navigate and re-acclimate to a stressful academic environment for the first time in many, many months. Our peers have been reporting significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety than the national average for years; living in the age of this pandemic surely hasn’t helped. Gadjecki’s philanthropy is, therefore, heartily appreciated.
Yet the tangible, immediate benefits of this hotline shouldn’t distract us from eyeing the viability of its funding model. Reporting on the 24/7 service revealed that Gadjecki was presented with a litany of projects CAMHS would love to fund; the hotline’s existence was the result of her selection among many. We are disappointed to learn that CAMHS, which has consistently been criticized for not meeting the needs of students, has a host of unimplemented initiatives due to a lack of rich donors eager to bankroll them.
While we understand the importance of philanthropy as a funding mechanism, a complete reliance on gifts to fund urgent investments in student wellbeing is simply not good enough. CAMHS is clearly burdened by a laundry list of unfinished, underfunded projects. The new hotline, for example, had been in development for years, but could only be actualized by a parent’s generosity. If it weren’t for Gajdecki, our peers would still suffer through late-night crises alone.
Frustratingly, the lack of appropriate investments in CAMHS don’t seem to stem from a lack of capital. Harvard is no stranger to grand, expensive projects. The new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston cost roughly $1 billion to develop, a hefty price that took care of everything but the growing worries about gentrification from the local Allston community. Oh, and concerns about sea levels swallowing the campus.
Mental health resources for students should not be contingent upon serendipitous donations. With an endowment in the billions, why can’t the University fund these mental health initiatives itself? With sky-high rates of depression on our campus, what could be more vital?
Harvard has the resources to properly safeguard the mental well-being of its students. Choosing not to do so — waiting instead on parents and wealthy donors to fulfill a need that surely predates them — shows exactly where the University’s priorities lie.
But if Harvard, the world’s richest university, cannot “afford” to adequately fund mental health resources, how can we expect any other university to do so?
We have critiqued, time and time again, Harvard’s reluctance to fund CAMHS more generously — a deficit that results in long wait times and dangerously poor service. Restricting or slowing down the development of initiatives that, like the newly inaugurated hotline, have been endorsed by mental health professionals seems borderline negligent.
Perhaps, for now, our best strategy is to court generous parents in the hopes they may fund more initiatives on CAMHS’s wishlist. We’ll thank them if they do. And to the children of rich and charitable parents, consider your peers when you complain to them about what’s missing at this school. Apparently, their generosity is our first (and maybe only) option.
This new hotline has the promise to do much good. But it's sad that the laundry list of other needed reforms will have to wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Tuesday defended Harvard’s engagement with residents and officials in Allston, where the school has received forceful pushback from elected leaders and civic organizations about its lofty development plans in the area.
Harvard owns roughly one-third of the land in Allston, ​​a neighborhood in the northwest part of Boston that sits across the Charles River from Harvard’s Cambridge campus. In recent months, the University has received pushback for its plans to build a 900,000-square-foot mixed use development called the Enterprise Research Campus, with prominent local officials calling on the city of Boston to halt the approval process until after the November mayoral election.
On Tuesday, Bacow rejected the claim leveled by some residents and civic groups in the neighborhood that top officials from the school have not been sufficiently engaged in the planning process, leaving Harvard’s long-term vision for the area a mystery to its residents.
“There’s only one me, and I try and spread myself around,” Bacow said after rattling off a laundry list of current and former officials he has met with during his presidency — including Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and the last two Boston mayors.
But four prominent elected officials from the area called for a moratorium on “all decision-making processes” related to the development in a letter to Boston Acting Mayor Kim Janey last month, writing that Harvard’s “participation in community outreach efforts in our neighborhood have been grossly insufficient.”
The officials — Boston City Councilor Liz Breadon, State Senator Sal N. DiDomenico, and State Representatives Kevin G. Honan and Michael J. Moran — wrote that the ERC proposal, along with a rezoning process taking place in an adjacent area where Harvard also owns land, “cannot be rushed to an arbitrary finish line” given their potential to shape the neighborhood’s future.
“It’s rare that a week goes by in which the University is not engaged in some discussion, either with representatives of the city or the state or the neighborhoods,” Bacow said. “My own view is that one would be pretty hard-pressed to say that we’ve rushed into things.”
Harvard employs staff who work full-time on government relations, Bacow noted in response to concerns about his lack of involvement with the Allston projects.
“They call me in when they need me,” he said. “And I’ve never said no.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the National Collegiate Athletic Association passed a policy allowing student athletes to profit off their brand image, a number of Harvard athletes are taking advantage of the new policy by inking sponsorship and endorsement deals with local and national brands.
Following the United States Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling this summer that the NCAA cannot restrict education-related benefits for collegiate student athletes, the NCAA Division I Board of Directors approved a new policy that took effect July 1 allowing individuals to profit off their name, image, and likeness, otherwise known as NIL deals.
Harvard football player Alex J. Washington ’23 said he has secured NIL deals with several groups, including Harvard Square business Playa Bowls, Positivity Alkaline Water, and a social media page focusing on graphic designs for college football.
Washington is one of Harvard’s 12 “Playa Athletes,” according to Playa Bowls managing partner Hung J. Lam. Lam said in an interview he believes the business’s decision to sponsor student athletes at Harvard and other schools in the greater Boston area, including Northeastern and Boston College, is compatible with the company’s objectives.
“Our goal with the partnership is twofold,” Lam said. “One is building awareness and getting the name of ‘Playa Bowls’ out to the Harvard community and then, secondly, to promote healthy eating too.”
Student athletes who sign with Playa Bowls receive merchandise as well as free food every month in exchange for promoting the restaurant on social media, per Lam. He added that Playa Bowls is considering expanding the program to include more student athletes and other campus brand ambassadors.
“It's nice to have folks that are really involved with the school, whether it's from an athletic standpoint or from different clubs," Lam said. "We're excited to have them just to be a part of it and to help us to market it and promote it, and we're seeing a nice return on it."
The financial benefits for some NIL deals, however, are not always as tangible. Harvard squash player Sam B. Scherl ’21-’22 said he was able to receive free rackets and other merchandise as part of an annual contract with Dunlop Sports. The deal did not provide much more than he already received from Harvard, Scherl noted.
“There really isn't a big difference, especially out of places like Harvard where they are paying for all of your gear,” Scherl said. “I kind of more sought out the racket sponsorship just because I thought it would be fun to explore an NIL opportunity, and this one came to mind and I had connections to the racket brand that I reached out to.”
Washington said he pursued sponsorships with brands he believes reflect his values.
“I went about it by just going with brands that showed who I was, that aligned with what I branded myself as, so honestly just reaching out to various different companies on Instagram, through Twitter, through all of the social medias, and then finding out what their brand is about and seeing if my beliefs align with theirs and trying to match up from there,” Washington said.
According to Washington, other members of the football team have been able to secure deals with Liquid IV, BodyArmor, and other brands.
Associate Director of Athletics for Compliance Christian Bray declined to comment on the number of student athletes who are actively part of NIL deals, but said the department supports students’ efforts to benefit from sponsorships.
Scherl said he is excited to be among the first crop of student athletes to explore sponsorship opportunities as part of the NCAA’s new policy.
“This generation of college athletes gets to be the first to explore what this could look like,” Scherl said. “It's just exciting to be on the frontier of that and figure out how the system works, and how student athletes can brand themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Afghan journalist Sami Mahdi discussed the future of the media in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan at a virtual event hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Thursday afternoon.
Thursday’s discussion, moderated by Charles M. Sennott, the CEO of the non-profit news organization GroundTruth Project, took place just over a month after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan following the U.S. military’s exit from the country.
Since regaining power, the Taliban has worked to suppress journalists throughout the country, including assaulting reporters covering protests in Kabul. More than half of Afghanistan’s media organizations have discontinued operations since the Taliban takeover, according to the New York Times.
Mahdi said Thursday that the Taliban seeks to exert control over the press with violent tactics, and declared the “scars on the faces of our journalists” are emblematic of the group’s relationship with the media.
“You will accept whatever Taliban gave you as a story, or you will be beaten up, or maybe killed or expelled from the country,” Mahdi said. “The only relationship the Taliban wants from media is [for the media] to become their mouthpiece and their puppets.”
Mahdi called the growth of a free and independent media in Afghanistan over the past 20 years — including the formation of about 170 radio stations across the country prior to the Taliban’s ascendance to power — a “very big achievement,” and credited the support of international allies for the expansion of the free press.
“It became the torch of liberty for our society. We didn’t have strong political parties like political opposition for the government. We didn’t have strong institutions. We didn’t have a strong parliament. We didn’t have a strong civil society,” Mahdi said. “The media was kind of playing all these roles by providing platforms to all people and all sorts of voices from all backgrounds.”
The Taliban crackdown on Afghan media outlets has particularly affected female journalists. A recent report from Reporters Without Borders found that just 39 female journalists are still working in Afghanistan, compared with 700 last year.
Mahdi called the female reporters “courageous,” noting that it was “taboo” in traditional Afghan society for them to pursue media careers.
However, he said the Taliban’s recent ascendancy has been demoralizing for female journalists.
“When [the] Taliban came to power, one of the first things they did was to take off all female reporters and presenters of RTA, our state-owned TV channel,” Mahdi said. “This discouraged all other female presenters and reporters all across the country because they knew that Taliban who are not respecting any laws, are in control, and their lives are at risk.”
Mahdi said the U.S. and other countries should engage with Afghan journalists in order to protect the country’s free press.
“Having a platform outside the country is very important now. They will be connected to journalists on the ground to tell the truth,” Mahdi said. “But those journalists who are on the ground will not be able to publish stories, under [their] own names, and on those outlets [that] are still in Afghanistan.”
As an example, Mahdi said reporters were necessary to ensure humanitarian aid is used properly.
“The expenditure of these aid monies should be monitored by Afghan media,” Mahdi said. “That’s how Afghan media could become a partner of the international community once again.”

The union representing Harvard’s dining workers, UNITE HERE Local 26, overwhelmingly ratified a new five-year contract with the University Thursday, securing compensation increases and job protections for current and laid-off employees after four months of negotiations and engagement with a federal mediator.
The vote was 99.45 percent in favor of the tentative agreement the two parties reached last week. The contract includes a 15 percent increase in wages over the duration of the contract and increases to summer stipends, as well as a guarantee of working hours for current dining workers and jobs for some recently laid-off employees. The agreement also maintains the health care plan Local 26 won in 2016 after going on strike for 22 days, rocking campus.
“This contract makes sure Harvard’s dining hall workers are part of the economic recovery from COVID-19,” Michael Kramer, executive vice president of Local 26, said in a written statement.
Out of 364 votes, 362 union members voted in favor of the contract, easily clearing the simple majority threshold required for ratification.
Harvard University Dining Services Managing Director Smitha S. H. Haneef shared the news with HUDS management Thursday evening.
“I am looking forward to the future with and for you to build our food systems and hospitality,” she wrote in an email obtained by The Crimson. “This is a big day for all of us, as one HUDS team, to progressively advance Harvard mission through our service.”
Under the new agreement, wages will be increased retroactive to June 21, with annual raises between 2.75 and 3.25 percent totaling $4.03 per hour over the five years, according to the union’s contract summary. The summer stipend, which pays HUDS employees over the vacation regardless of number of shifts they work, will also gradually increase from $3,000 to $3,800 by the end of the agreement.
The contract also maintains the union’s current health care coverage, which was a landmark achievement in its last round of contract negotiations. In 2016, Harvard agreed to pay insurance copays on the University staff and hourly insurance plans for HUDS employees and created a new premium contribution tier for employees who make less than $55,000 annually.
Additionally, HUDS will maintain the “authorized hours of every current HUDS employee” on the payroll as of Dec. 1, according to the union's contract summary.
The protections against layoffs and hours reductions come after the union alleged last month HUDS management was planning to cut 20 percent of full-time dining positions in the residential houses after reviewing the University’s proposed schedules for the next academic years. Harvard has since withdrawn those schedules.
Edwin J. Hinspeter, a Leverett House shop steward, said he believes the job security side letter is unprecedented for Local 26.
“It’s a really good contract for us,” he said after casting his ballot. “I believe the job security language — we’ve never had language like that before.”
Willie H. Moore, an assistant cook at Harvard Law School, said he voted yes because he wants to maintain his current position until retirement.
“I’ve been there 22 years,” he said. “I would love to retire there and continue my life.”
HUDS will also offer positions to employees formerly contracted from dining management company Restaurant Associates who were laid off from the Graduate School of Design and the Law School earlier this year, according to the Local 26 contract summary.
According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, Harvard is seeking to fill more than 50 positions, and former RA employees are welcome to apply.
Claudia J. Escobar, a former catering employee at HLS who was laid off from her position, said the contract may allow her to return to work as a Harvard employee.
“It is our right to [go] back to work because we [were] working during the pandemic, and I think we deserve to go back to work,” Escobar said after voting to ratify the contract.
Hilary J. Flores-Hebert, a Business School dining worker and volunteer at the polling station, said she decided to volunteer to help other members gain a contract that guaranteed greater job security. In addition, she said she supports the continued health care benefits and compensation increases.
“I think that’s super important, given that we’re essential workers, that we put so much of our time and effort to contribute to this community,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The all-female Bee Club has its own clubhouse once again, thanks to a $2.2 million purchase of the building that formerly housed Café Pamplona by the club’s president, a College junior.
According to the property deed, Susana M.A. Vik ’21-’23, the current president of the Bee Club, and Carrie Vik, of Greenwich, Conn., purchased the three-story, 2,452 square-foot building located at 12 Bow St. on June 19 for $2.2 million.
The property is the former location of Café Pamplona, which shuttered its doors in May 2020 due to a sharp drop in customers after serving Harvard Square for more than 60 years. The City of Cambridge assessed the value of the building at roughly $1.5 million this year.
Two College students with direct knowledge of the situation, including a member of the Bee, told The Crimson the property will now serve as the Bee’s clubhouse. The Crimson granted both students anonymity to discuss the club’s intentions.
Vik declined to comment for this article.
Vik’s purchase of the property bookends the Bee Club’s divorce from the Delphic Club and gives the all-female final club physical autonomy for the first time in four years.
In fall 2017, the Bee vacated its 45 Dunster St. clubhouse, which now houses the Hasty Pudding Club, to move into the Delphic Club’s space at 9 Linden St. after the clubs merged into the co-ed Delphic-Bee Club.
The clubs’ merger followed the debut of the College’s controversial sanctions policy, which targeted members of single-gender social groups. The sanctions, announced in May 2016, penalized members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. Under the policy, undergraduate members of Harvard’s single-gender social groups were barred from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships.
The sanctions were met with fierce scrutiny and spawned a pair of lawsuits. Harvard ended the sanctions policy in 2020 after administrators concluded the University would “be legally barred from further enforcing the policy” due to a recent ruling handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Delphic Club and Bee Club’s marriage ended last fall — one month after the University rolled back the sanctions.
The Bee Club’s purchase of its own clubhouse — a permanent home for the all-female social group — therefore sounds the death knell for the University’s sanctions policy.
A banner with the Bee Club insignia currently adorns one of the building’s first-floor windows.

There is a common adage that history is bound to repeat itself. If history repeats itself Friday, the Harvard-Brown football rivalry will end with a Crimson victory. In a game that traditionally marks Harvard’s start to the Ivy League season, the Crimson has dominated the all-time series, 87-30-2, including its last nine overall and the last ten home games. The last time these two teams met on the gridiron, it was no contest, with Harvard running away in the second half in a 42-7 trouncing in 2019.
Yet, despite the rivalry’s lopsided recent history, this is a new Bears team that will travel from Providence, R.I., to face the Crimson inside Harvard Stadium on Friday at 7 p.m. Brown (0-1, 0-0 Ivy) enters the game coming off a 45-24 home loss to Rhode Island last Saturday in the 105th Governors Cup, a rivalry game between the two schools. Despite the defeat, the Bears showed off their explosive offense, totaling 534 yards to Rhode Island’s 435. Senior quarterback EJ Perry, who earned first-team All-Ivy honors in 2019 in his first season with the team after transferring from Boston College, racked up 344 yards through the air and 59 more on the ground in nine carries in his season debut.
Despite Brown’s prolific offensive performance, senior linebacker Jordan Hill is confident in his team's game plan.
“Yeah, they’re a high-powered offense, but we’re a strong defense. We know that we can get it done at the end of the day. They have a great quarterback, so we know that he’s definitely going to put us in those situations when it comes down to players making plays and we have all the confidence in the world to know that we can make those plays when it matters most,” said Hill after Harvard’s last practice of the week on Wednesday night.
Meanwhile, Harvard is coming off a dominant 44-9 victory over Georgetown in Washington, D.C., last Saturday. The Crimson’s running backs, Aidan Borguet, Aaron Shampklin, and Sone Ntoh, ran roughshod over the Hoyas, totaling 335 yards on the ground while the defensive line limited the Hoyas to just six total rushing yards on the day. Shampklin in particular stepped up with a career-high 183 yards on 14 carries and two touchdowns. Sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean was rarely forced to throw, but on 19 attempts was effective, completing 10 of his passes for 94 yards and two touchdowns.
Dean said that, despite the multi-dimensional offense that the Crimson presented against Georgetown, he found plenty of room for improvement as the team watched film and had seen more consistency throughout the week.
“I think everyone had their first-game jitters and stuff like that, so they got their first-game mistakes out of the way, and I think we’re ready to roll. We were more consistent over the week in our assignments, catching the ball, running the ball, things like that,” he said.
A locked-in Harvard offense, which is loaded with playmakers, could prove dangerous for the Bears defense. In addition to the trio of running backs, the Crimson also features talented wide receivers, including first-year Kaedyn Odermann, who caught two passes for 38 yards, with a 31-yard score, junior Kym Wimberley Jr., who hauled in four targets for 30 yards, and sophomore Gavin Sharkey, who turned three catches into 16 yards.
Brown’s defense was led by junior outside linebacker Junior Gafa against Rhode Island, who recorded seven solo tackles. Senior middle linebacker Jason Medeiros, sophomore middle linebacker Isaiah Gamble, and junior cornerback Cooper DeVeau each managed to record a sack. Dean noticed the Bears’ physicality as he watched their film.
“Brown has gotten a lot better from 2019. [They’ve] gotten a lot stronger. You can tell they’ve been in the weight room, their [defensive line] is pretty quick, [and] their [defensive backs] are pretty sound,” he remarked before adding, “but as long as we play our game, they can’t stop us.”
The defense, arguably an even more potent threat, is led by Hill, who was chosen before the canceled 2020 season as Harvard’s 147th captain. The 6’1” linebacker was named to the All-Ivy First Team in the 2019 season, leading the Ancient Eight with three forced fumbles and tying for third by recovering two more. In a dominant performance by the Crimson defense overall, Hill totaled five tackles, while junior linebacker Daniel Abraham intercepted a pass and junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes and sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec each recorded two sacks.
“Our defensive line is crazy, like they are every year: arguably the best defensive line in the country. And they came with it again [against Georgetown], and just showed us why we consider them the best [defensive line] in the country. So, they’re just hitting on all cylinders and keeping it moving,” Hill said.
After bringing down Hoyas QB Joseph Brunell six times, Harvard’s front seven will hope to keep the pressure on Perry. If Perry manages to get the ball out, his top targets will be Hayes Sutton and Wes Rockett, each of whom managed to accumulate more than 75 yards receiving and a touchdown apiece. On the ground, the Bears are led by senior running back Allen Smith, who rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, and first-year Jordan DeLucia, who totaled 41 yards on seven carries in his collegiate debut.
On offense, Brown is known for rotating its entire offensive line throughout the game, which Bears Coach James Perry surely hopes will help his players stay fresh against Harvard’s fearsome defensive front.
“It is interesting that they rotate their offensive line. That is something that you don’t really hear about too often. Especially with the strength of our defensive line, it will be interesting to see how those two combat one another,” Hill noted.
The game marks the start of the 2021 Ivy League season for the Crimson, which will hope to raise its tenth banner in Coach Tim Murphy’s 27 seasons and its 18th since the Ivy League began play in 1956. Harvard was projected to finish fourth in the Ancient Eight in a preseason media poll, behind Princeton, Yale, and Dartmouth. A win against the Bears would mark a solid start to its bid to better its projection by three spots, and it would not come as a surprise; in the Murphy era, Harvard is 21-5 (.808) in Ivy League openers. With a victory, Murphy would pass Yale’s Carm Cozza to take sole possession as the winningest coach in Ivy League history, as it would mark his 180th win at the helm of the Crimson.
After the game against Georgetown, he refused to comment on his history-making victory. Similarly, his players are single-mindedly focused on making Brown’s visit an unwelcome one. When asked what Harvard fans could expect from his offense early in the game, Dean neglected to provide any insight on specific game plans. Instead, he succinctly described his mentality.
“Just a win. Just be competitive. I don’t want to say too much, but just win. That’s our mentality. We want to put a banner up in that arch in that corner over there, and it starts with Brown on Friday. Gotta go 1 and 0,” he said.
The Brown tilt will mark the Crimson’s first home game since November 16, 2019, when it was defeated by Penn, 24-20. After losing last season to the Covid-19 pandemic, both Dean and Hill hoped that thousands of roaring Crimson fans would help carry the team to victory on Friday night.
“It’s great to have the fans back here in Harvard Stadium. It’s a great venue, and to know that we have the community behind us as we play is something special and something that we definitely missed out on last year. So just having that opportunity to play in front of our fans and people who support us on and off the field is something that I can’t even really put into words and is something that I’m definitely looking forward to and I know everyone else on the team is as well,” said Hill.
The game will be shown on ESPNU, marking one of two occasions this season that the Crimson will be nationally televised, the other being Nov. 23 at Yale (ESPN Networks). Harvard's game against Dartmouth on Oct. 30 will also be televised regionally on NESN.

As is the case in life, many things only happen in our dreams: finishing a pset before the day it’s due, a full eight hours of sleep, and the shuttle being there for you when you actually need it. Whether you’re going to class from the Quad or Mather, returning back home after a long day of walking, or trying to visit the new SEAS complex, the shuttle is always necessary and never on schedule. And since we’re busy students, it’s probably a good idea to be ~productive~ when spending those many hours waiting for it to arrive. Here are some ideas for when you’ve finished listening through your entire Spotify library:
Finish a Reading for a Class
Let’s be real, this applies to most assignments that require you to consume media. Downloading your book onto your phone? Actually bringing your physical textbook to the shuttle? You’ve got the time, so you might as well start reading! Pros of this approach include appearing as if you have your life together — especially if your textbook is one of those giant ones that require some strength to carry. You might even be able to retain some of the information if you focus enough… which, let’s be real, is going to require all of your mental capacity and will probably never happen before your 9 a.m., but at least you can say you tried!
Walk to the Yard and Back
Do you find yourself without time to stay active? Is your phone’s health app disappointed because you haven’t met your daily step target? Now that you have some downtime while waiting for the shuttle, you might as well begin to move that body! Take a quick walk to the Yard and back if you’re coming from the Quad. You might return just in time for the next shuttle. Shuttle still not there? Sources indicate that you can walk all the way to MIT or even the Boston Common and back before the next shuttle.
Become Fluent in Klingon
Honestly, you can try out any language. The U.S. Foreign Service Institute estimates that you can become fluent in a language like Spanish or Italian in 480 hours, so while this might have to be spread across an entire week of waiting for the shuttle, you’ll experience many benefits with your newfound multilingualism. Finally master that one language on your résumé  you’ve been lying about being fluent in! Get a head start on that language citation you’ve been meaning to add! Just make sure you don’t spend TOO much time waiting for the shuttle, or else you might start to become too fluent in your new language, start to forget English, and vIDelmeH jIblIj, 'ej bISopqu'mo' qa'lI' je, HoS lIng.
Finish One (1) Question on Your Orgo Pset
These things take forever, just like waiting for the shuttle. So why not try to combine two infinities to make them both go by faster? You can try this method out with any pset. Wait an hour for the shuttle and you might be able to finish a question. Or not. Psets are hard.
However you choose to spend your time, try your best to keep up a positive attitude and know that somehow, the shuttle will arrive (try out the new app: Passio Go). It might be in 3-5 business days, but it will come!
