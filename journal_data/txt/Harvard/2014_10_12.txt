After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cool afternoon in Cambridge, it took the Harvard football team a long time to heat up.
After an ugly first half in which the Crimson tallied zero points and turned the ball over four times, Harvard (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) scored on four of its five second half drives to earn a 24-7 victory over visiting Cornell (0-4, 0-2).
Buoyed by strong defensive play that held the Big Red scoreless for 56 minutes, Harvard ultimately had enough to overcome its early struggles and earn its second conference victory of the season.
“The defense is the whole story,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Even if we score 40 points, it all starts with the defense, and the defense today was downright heroic. It dominated the line of scrimmage, really gave [Cornell] nothing.”
While the Crimson defense was outstanding all game long, for the offense, the first and second halves could hardly have been more different. Harvard’s one chance at a first-half score came at the end of the second quarter, but senior kicker Andrew Flesher clanked a 43-yard field goal attempt off the right post.
But once the sun finally emerged from the clouds in the second half, the Crimson offense came roaring to life. Harvard scored points on three consecutive drives to take a 17-0 lead that its defense would not relinquish.
On its first drive of the second half, with junior running back Paul Stanton returning from injury, the Crimson rode a series of runs and passes deep into Cornell territory.
On fourth-and-14 at the Big Red 24-yard line, Murphy elected to go for it. The gamble paid off big time, as junior quarterback Scott Hosch found a wide-open sophomore tight end Anthony Firkser on the left side of the field for the easy touchdown.
The Crimson added to its point total on the very next drive. After Hosch connected with Firkser for a 35-yard gain and converted on another fourth down, Flesher stepped on and confidently punched in a 23-yard field goal to make it a two-possession game.
Just minutes after forcing another Cornell punt, Hosch and Stanton teamed up to lead a seven-play, 60-yard drive highlighted by a leaping, 22-yard catch by junior tight end Ben Braunecker over the middle. Harvard pushed the score to 17-0 when Stanton punched in a three-yard touchdown run up the middle.
“[Cornell] had a lot of different looks and did a great job bringing pressure,” Hosch said. “I missed a couple of opportunities in the first half that I should have taken advantage of, but I knew if we kept plugging away that we'd break through.”
Saturday represented a banner day for the Harvard defense. The Crimson front seven was stalwart all game long, allowing just 35 net rushing yards on 34 Cornell attempts.
Senior defensive end Zack Hodges finished with two sacks on the day, with the first putting him in sole possession of the all-time Harvard record.
“We talk about putting our brick on the wall that is Harvard football,” Hodges said. “It's nice to be able to at least partially—we'll see how the season finishes—but put my brick up there in [a few] months, with all those 10,000 men who did it before me."
Constant pressure on freshman quarterback Jake Jatis, coupled with a flock of defenders crashing on all running plays, held Cornell to just 53 yards in the half. The first time Cornell moved the chains came with just under four minutes remaining in the first half.
The Harvard defense’s only hiccup came with just over three minutes remaining in the game. Following the Crimson’s fifth turnover of the day, Jatis found receiver Collin Shaw wide open in the back of the end zone for the 26-yard score.
But Harvard had no trouble negating the Big Red score, as senior running back Andrew Casten capped off a rapid touchdown drive with a two-yard touchdown run up the middle that concluded the day’s scoring.
If the Crimson defense had not turned in such a strong performance, Harvard could have found itself in a considerable hole at the conclusion of the first half. After its first seven drives, the Crimson posted a bleak stat line of four turnovers and three punts.
On the first offensive play of the game, Hosch attempted to find Casten in the flat. But Big Red defensive lineman Justin Harris jumped in the air and picked off the errant throw with his outstretched arms.
Harris’ impact continued later in the quarter, when he jarred the ball loose from a scrambling Hosch. The subsequent Crimson drive featured another fumble, when freshman tight end Jack Stansell reeled in a pass but immediately coughed it up after turning downfield into the arms of a Cornell defender.
The Crimson finally got something going offensively early in the second quarter, riding passes and Casten runs into Big Red territory. But on second down, Cornell safety Rush Imhotep jumped an outside slant to secure Hosch’s second interception of the day.
For the first time since 2010, Harvard had been shut out in the first half of a game. It took a while, but the Crimson offense finally made the scoreboard come to life in time to secure a win.
“Today, it obviously goes down in the category of an ugly win, but at the end of the day, as I told the kids, it'll be a win tomorrow,” Murphy said. “In a hundred years from now, it's gonna be a win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Deep into extra time, a meager five meters stood between the Harvard women’s rugby team and the try zone. With seconds winding off the clock, junior co-captain Hope Schwartz accelerated through an opening in Dartmouth’s line to score the go-ahead try and give the Crimson a 10-5 victory over the Big Green on Saturday afternoon.
Entering the game, Harvard (3-2, 3-2 Ivy) was locked in a four-way tie for second place in the Ancient Eight. Since only four teams advance to the Ivy League Championships, the Crimson’s postseason aspirations were on the line. With the last-minute victory on Saturday, Harvard kept its hopes for a back-to-back title alive.
“This was a must-win for us,” Crimson coach Sue Parker said. “The team came out and just had unbelievable tenacity in executing the game plan. It was kind of an ugly game given the weather, but the effort, the communication, and the teamwork were the best we had all season long.”
The Crimson dominated possession throughout the afternoon. Although Harvard kept the ball well into Dartmouth’s defensive zone for a majority of the contest, the Crimson struggled to break through and score. Strong on-field tackling from the Big Green (2-3, 2-2 Ivy) continually thwarted Harvard’s efforts near the try-zone, keeping the game locked in a scoreless tie.
In the final moments of the first half, Crimson senior flank Lenica Morales-Valenzuela broke the Dartmouth line and the tie, scoring a try to give Harvard a 5-0 lead heading into intermission.
“Today when we went out, we went out with a ‘we need this’ mentality and a ‘we are going to do it’ mentality,” co-captain Kayleigh Henry said. “So although we did hit a few bumps, we just knew we were going to score.”
Saturday’s rain made the contest a defensive affair. Both teams had difficulty making strong, crisp passes and getting the slippery ball out wide, thus confining the game to the center of the field.
Parker made adjustments at halftime to try to help the Crimson capitalize on its surfeit of scoring opportunities.
“We went more to a pick-and-go type attack that allowed us to retain possession and continue to chew up some ground and put some more points on the board,” Parker said.
With this adjustment in strategy, Harvard’s offense continued to apply pressure and control the tempo of the game in the second half. But the Crimson still had difficulty getting past the Big Green line to score.
Coming off of last week’s loss at Princeton—a result that jeopardized the Crimson’s spot in the Ivy League tournament—Harvard knew it needed to make changes on the field.
In practice this week, Parker focused on giving her young players more experience in game-like situations.
“We worked a lot more on executing the game plan,” Parker said. “We put other, smaller technical pieces of the game to the side and decided to work on bigger picture things.”
One break in the game plan threatened to ruin the efforts that the Crimson had put forth the entire week.
With just under 10 minutes left in the half, Dartmouth junior wing Kerry Anne Conlin took a pass from her teammate at midfield and powered downfield to score a try and even the score, 5-5.
The intensity of the game thus picked up in those final 10 minutes, with both teams battling for the lead. The Big Green vied for another try, attempting to repeat its 2013 regular season victory over Harvard. But it was Schwartz and the Crimson offense that strung together one final attack to earn the win and four additional points in the Ivy League standings.
“Every single person played a full 80 minutes,” Henry said. “We were able to come out and deliver. I’ve never been this proud of this team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that the Harvard football team was shut out in the first half, it was 2010—and the squad eventually dropped the contest to Penn, 34-14.
When senior kicker Andrew Flesher’s 43-yard field goal attempt bounced off the right post in the last play of the first half, the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) headed into halftime against Cornell (0-4, 0-2) with the score knotted at zero.
But this time around, Harvard found the offensive firepower that had been missing for the first 30 minutes. After failing to score on each of its drives before the intermission, the Crimson scored on all but one of its second half drives.
With the 24-7 win over the Big Red and Yale’s defeat at the hands of Dartmouth, Harvard remains the only Ivy League team with an undefeated record.
“We started out of joint on offense at times, obviously, but to our kids' credit, they really did a great job in the second half,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They pulled it together, they executed, they found a way to get a win."
The Crimson didn’t get onto the board until its first drive of the second half, when Murphy elected to insert junior running back Paul Stanton, who was uncertain to play before the game due to a preseason injury aggravated in the game against Holy Cross.
“I was hoping not to have to use him,” Murphy said. “I felt like we could control the tempo, felt like we could control the line of scrimmage. We just needed a little bit of a jolt, a little bit of something, and Paul certainly gave it to us.”
Stanton rushed for 24 yards on that drive before junior quarterback Scott Hosch found sophomore tight end Anthony Firkser wide open on the left sideline on fourth-and-14 for the game’s first touchdown to put Harvard up, 7-0. Flesher hit a short field goal on the next drive, and Stanton found the end zone on the following possession to give the Crimson the 17-point advantage.
Of seven first-half possessions, the Crimson punted three times, fumbled the ball twice, was intercepted twice, and missed a field goal.
Cornell started three drives in Harvard territory but couldn’t capitalize on the field position, experiencing similar difficulties on the offensive side of the ball. Before halftime, the Big Red punted the ball six times, turned it over on downs once, and threw one pick. Neither team managed to make it into the red zone during the first half.
ZACK ATTACK
Despite forcing four turnovers in the first half, Cornell failed to put points on the board until late in the fourth quarter, largely due to the Crimson’s experienced defensive front seven that stuffed the Big Red rushing attack. On 34 rushing attempts, Cornell registered just 35 yards.
Without success in the running game, Cornell was forced to rely on freshman quarterback Jake Jatis to move the chains. Jatis ended the day with 140 yards, but the rookie was forced to make errant throws throughout the game while under pressure.
Two of the four Crimson sacks on the day came from senior defensive end Zack Hodges, who with his first sack early in the first quarter took sole possession of the all-time record at Harvard. Hodges, who also had a quarterback hurry, now has 22.5 career sacks.
“I didn't really know [that I broke the record] until coach came over and was like, 'You have the record, congrats,’” Hodges said. “But it's very humbling. Hopefully one day one of my young goons, that's what I call the younger D-ends, one of the young goons will take it from me."
With Harvard’s offense sputtering early on, the defense largely kept the team in the game. The Big Red failed to convert a first down until its last drive before halftime, which ended when junior linebacker Eric Medes caught a tipped pass to pick off Jatis.
TURNOVER CITY
Even with a struggling offense, senior punter David Bicknell got quite a bit of rest, as the majority of Harvard’s first-half drives ended in a turnover.  Troubles began early for the Crimson—on Harvard’s first offensive play of the game, Hosch’s pass was snagged by Big Red defensive lineman Justin Harris.
The senior lineman made another play two drives later, when Harris hit Hosch on a scramble to force a fumble.
Whether the weather played a factor or not, the Crimson wideouts had trouble hanging onto the ball in the first half. Harvard finally entered Cornell territory for the first time when Hosch connected with freshman tight end Jack Stansell on a 17-yard pass, but Stansell coughed up the ball to end the drive. Hosch ended the half with two picks.
The Crimson’s final turnover came late in the fourth quarter, on the only drive of the half that didn’t end in points. Senior running back Andrew Casten lost the ball deep in Harvard territory to set up Cornell’s only scoring drive.

The BDCwire released an article this week that asked college students in the Boston area how they felt about students from other Boston schools. Fun. What was the lowdown on Harvard, you ask?
Lisa from Boston College starts off  by calling Harvard “sexually frustrated and well-endowed.” Is that why BC kids show up at Harvard every weekend? Yeah, I didn’t think so.
Chris from Emerson College adds, “Always swipe right on Tinder because starving artists might need some financial support.”Thanks for being refreshingly honest, Chris. Maybe I’ll throw you a bone and buy one of your paintings off of Etsy someday.
Amanda from Northeastern remarks, “Their boys are compensating for something.”You know what, Amanda? Maybe you’re the one compensating for something.
That’s all for now, folks. Tune in for next week when BDCwire releases their follow-up survey “How do Boston college students feel about how other Boston college students about Boston colleges?”

It’s fall, which means both a stream of papers and midterms, but also, more excitingly, apple cider season. Since you can’t always satisfy your cider fix in the dhall, we shopped around the Square and came up with this list of our favorite cider spots for you to try.
1. Darwin’s Ltd., at 148 Mt Auburn St.Price for small cup: $2
The apple cider at this cozy cafe is very sweet. Served cold, it’s like a rich apple juice with heightened acidity; served hot, it comes with a thin layer of foam and deeper apple flavor. The hot apple cider, perhaps because of its rich undertones, is perfect for the chillier days spent studying.
2. Crema Cafe, at 27 Brattle St.Price for small cup: $2.25
People often say that taste is largely dependent on smell, and just the aroma of Crema’s apple cider will get you salivating. The drink has an intense apple scent—one that’s not artificial but rather reminiscent of baked apples coming right out of the oven. Its color is a rich caramel, and unlike Darwin’s apple cider, the flavor here is more tart than sweet. We recommend it served cold.
3. Tealuxe, at 0 Brattle St.Price for small cup: $4.45
The apple cider in this dimly lit teashop comes in a dark honey-brown color. It’s not so much tangy as it tastes simply of apples, but this drink leaves a warm, bitter aftertaste. In fact, it’s like tea: not particularly sour, with just the right touch of earthy.
