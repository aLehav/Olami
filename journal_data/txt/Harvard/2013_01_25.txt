After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama spent almost 20 minutes addressing the nation during his second inaugural address on Monday. As he delivered his remarks, it became increasingly clear that we were in for a speech different in both tone and substance than the largely post-partisan and conciliatory approach proffered four years prior. While the first-term Obama pleaded America to hopefully accept the notion that “the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply,” the new and improved version implores an unidentified opponent to not “mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.”
The shift in the nature of his speech marked a momentous occasion. Instead of blithely pretending that all Americans share the same principled beliefs, Obama argued that the fight for freedom and justice is not complete until there is necessary action on a variety of progressive fronts. The president made history by becoming the first of his office to publicly come out in favor of gay equality under the law, and he attracted almost as much post-address attention for his support of legislation addressing climate change. Some, including Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticized the audacity of his remarks, ominously announcing “the era of liberalism is back” in what is ultimately a mistake “directed at an America [he] still [believes] is center-right.”
While Senator McConnell is not wrong about the liberal nature of President Obama’s peroration, his assertion that Obama’s progressive views conflict with those held by the majority of the country is nonsensical. This fall, Obama not only won reelection, giving him a mandate to carry out the agenda he pleases, but his Democratic Party also picked up seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Furthermore, public opinion polling continually demonstrates nationwide support for the social agenda outlined by the president. Sixty-three percent of Americans now identify global warming as a serious problem. Support for same-sex marriage rises year after year, such that a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows 51 percent of the country in favor. This measure is up from 30 percent in 2004 and 41 percent in 2009. At this rate, an overwhelming majority will likely approve of marriage equality by the next election. We strongly believe it is the duty of the nation’s leader to reflect the views of where the country is going, as opposed to those of where the country has been.
The problem we have with President Obama’s address does not stem from his better-late-than-never advocacy of issues many have spent the last four years so patiently waiting for. Rather, the speech’s flaw results from the issue the president conveniently ignored: the perilous state of our nation’s finances and impending budgetary decisions. We are disappointed with the president’s wholesale commitment to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, each of which he mentioned by name. Mention of these policies in the same breath as important constitutional rights reflects a fundamental lack of seriousness in confronting one of the most urgent battles ahead. It is no secret that the structure of American entitlement spending needs to be reformed. As such, it is disappointing to see the president return to election-style demagoguery, reminiscent of when each side spuriously accused the other of wanting to take away Medicare.
On the whole, it was refreshing to see Obama take up the issues that originally attracted so many passionate campaign supporters. We are optimistic that the president will make strides in the realm of civil rights such as those not seen in half a decade. However, we also hope that he does not lose sight of the financial uncertainty plaguing so many Americans since the days of his predecessor. There may remain a yet un-bridged divide in the nation on the topic of social issues, but the country stands united in its desideration of more jobs and a growing economy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Flu season comes every year, but flu fever seemingly only comes every few. This is one of those years, as the nation is once again gripped with such a feverish panic. The routine is simple. First, mayors announce a public health emergency. Then, news organizations seize onto the story, scaring viewers to gain an audience. Parents racked with worry tell us not to shake hands, touch doors, or generally venture outside our homes. Finally, confined inside, us 21st century denizens use Google to seek advice, and Google tracks our manic searches.
So just how bad is this year’s influenza virus? Well according to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who was the first to declare a public health emergency, “This is the worst flu season we’ve seen since 2009.” Google’s search algorithms concur. This is the worst flu season in four whole years!
Flu season marks not only a rise in temperatures but also a drop in rational thinking. Luckily, the Centers of Disease Control has it together, rightfully saying the same thing they do every year. “The bottom line: It’s flu season,” said director Tom Frieden. While I do not mean to suggest that sickness is any laughing matter, the mania that has accompanied it this year seems silly. After all, flu season is an inevitability, and the vaccine treatment opportunity is the same year in, year out.
A Wake Forest study published last week on the psychology of safe behavior in epidemics shows that “people’s willingness to engage in safe behavior waxes or wanes over time…when prevalence is low, a ‘self-protection fatigue’ effect sets in whereby individuals are less willing to engage in safe behavior over time.” So with the last two winters being unseasonably warm, it seems as if we have forgotten that flu seasons can in fact be debilitating and that it is important to get the vaccine early.
While many want to talk about the degree of this year’s flu outbreak and try to convince the last skeptical few that the vaccine is more likely to protect one’s health than cause autism, the flu conversation centers on all the wrong issues. We must discuss how to prevent the spread of flu next year and every year after that. If the flu is so predictable, it seems obvious that the public health community, with much of its brain trust here in Boston and at Harvard, should by now have a consistent preventative medical response.
To create a culture around yearly flu vaccinations, we should look to how social knowledge is created. Social scientists have long known the best way to achieve a shared cultural consciousness is habitualization. Consistency in Harvard University Health Services’ preventative approach to the flu in the critical August-December months should be prioritized. Several students contacted for this article expressed that the level of publicity for the flu shot this year wasn’t consistent with last year. Even if the previous year’s flu season was mild, consistent advertising is important. If our medical institutions take a break on emphasizing early prevention even for a year, the Harvard community could enter into the so-called “self-protection fatigue” and forget to get the vaccine. In that case, we all get the flu fever.
Another implication of the Wake Forest study is that lowering the cost of self-protection increases its uptake. Since the vaccine is already free, the most costly part about getting it is the time spent in line and finding the HUHS clinic hours. Of the students I spoke with, those who were athletes all received the flu vaccine because it was both required and provided during their yearly physicals. To make things as simple and uniform for the rest of the Harvard community, any patient given a physical or who visits HUHS for any reason from August-December should be offered the flu vaccine. We would all rather get a shot with our visit than have to stand in another line. It’s also more preferable than standing in the massive lines in January, when supplies are running low and are not guaranteed. The administration should take this and other efforts to make the vaccination process uniform. For instance, a yearly campus-wide email to encourage vaccination early in the fall semester would be much more helpful than an after-the-fact email warning students with any flu symptoms to stay home.
We have a fever on our hands this year, and if we don’t do anything about it, we’ll go through this very same dance again in a couple of years. We already know there will be a flu season next year and every year after that. We know that getting the vaccine early will help us stay protected. Hopefully, Harvard recognizes the predictability of this year’s madness and makes real institutional changes that are consistently anticipatory of flu season each year. If nothing else, let’s remember this aphorism: A flu shot a year keeps the fever away!

I attended the marriage of two teachers at my former school over the break. Hymns were sung, readings were taken from Bible and from poems, prayers were offered for the hope of love in our weary world. As they were two men this was a “blessing,” not a sacrament; under British law, this was a “civil partnership” and not a wedding. The Church of England, in internecine spasm over sexuality, deployed an observer to ensure the priest stayed within orthodoxy, some abject person having complained to the bishop about the use of the church building. Despite this, in every real way, two people in love were married on New Year’s Eve. Neither earth, nor rock, nor curtain split. It seemed a moment of grace so self-evident you’d dream it would melt the hardest, most hateful hearts.
As this event created a new family, it trawled the collective memory of my own, resurrecting talk of a relative I had not known before. Roy was my grandfather’s uncle. Roy was young in England’s interwar years, lodged in reminiscence as sunlight-dappled, faintly melancholic idyll, full of misplaced hope and constrained grief. There are albums, apparently, of photographs—Brideshead boys in sepia. Roy was young, which was easy, and homosexual, which was not; and as he aged away from the former the harder the latter became. In darker, post-war years, with no expectation of permanence, no possibility of intimacy beneath the jackboot of criminality, Roy killed himself. Not because of what he was, but because of what a stunted society made it mean. Sixty years later, the trauma fades to an old woman’s sigh. “Poor Roy could never be himself,” my grandmother says.
My teachers held their reception in the grandest room of my grand high school, panelled with the names of alumni fallen in the world wars. “They were young”, the inscriptions say. At that intersection of past and future, hope and loss, I think of Roy. He came of lesser background, but I struggle to separate my paltry notion of him from the handsome innocents, fresh from dormitory and playing field, sent to Somme and Spitfire to die. Many of them, those who wrote and poetized at least, were men like Roy: Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke, others on that wall no doubt, lost to time and concealment. They thought of Achilles, Nisus, and Hyacinthus; they fell for Britain and its flowered fields, for its empire they would never see and its freedoms they did not know.
Surrounded by their names, I wondered what they would think of the wedding. I had cared about marriage equality and discrimination, intellectually and personally, as so many of us do, but never before with a sense of righteousness. That is a word we often surrender to our opponents, along with words like truth and zeal. Instead, we couch our struggles in fairness and equality; fine, relativistic, non-objectionable phrases. We do not talk of morality, because there is no debate in morality.  There is no room for the necessary and active process of changing minds. We respect that which should not be respected. Though they call us wicked, we do not call them the same, even when they sermonize their children to suicide or sponsor executions in Africa. We respond, when they claim the marginalization of their opinions and loss of their societal monopoly is “intolerance,” as if they had knowledge of the word. We go on, though we are tired. We speak, though they will not listen.
With Roy though, I find the limit of tolerance. At a point, we must stand up for those who kneeled. All minorities carry with them the burdens of their past: scars of survival, guilt of possibility, difficulty in integrating their todays, tomorrows, and yesterdays. The Germans, in their compound way, call it “vergangenheitsbewältigung”—the struggle to come to terms with the past. Just as time is illusory, so the past is always with us, even if it cannot speak. In liminal moments, it is one with the present. Like my grandfather’s uncle, it finds us out, whether we seek it or not.
As we enter this new year full of potential advances, those of us who care about justice and equality should recommit ourselves to the cause with the knowledge that Dr. Martin Luther King’s universal arc is with us, that the past will be healed and the future made brighter. When you encounter genuine ignorance, misapprehension, and misconception, work to correct it, not because you should have to but because you can. When you encounter hatefulness, wrapped in pseudo-religion or pseudo-intellectualism, with “purity” on its lips and barbed wire in its eyes, expose it for what it is. This is our moral necessity. Under the light of history’s truth, it will fade away. It deserves to die, as much as Roy did not.

This winter, for the first time I traveled to a country without knowing quite what to call it. Since 1989, the country has had two distinct names. According to the military government, it is Myanmar; yet to those fighting to restore democracy, it has remained Burma. Thus, in the two decades since the military junta rebranded the country as Myanmar, the national nomenclature has become polarized to represent two distinct visions for the country’s future. As a foreigner hailing from the world’s bastion of democracy, I felt compelled to adhere to our national stance on the issue and refer to the country as Burma. I found this choice to be supported by most of the people I encountered on my trip. However, after two weeks in the country, I became more aware of the degree of legitimacy that has been restored to the Myanmar government in the past few years. Although the gulf between the military and proponents of democracy has not been completely bridged, the effort the government has taken to move toward democracy should be considered as the world judges where the country, and its name, stand.
Before I examine the grounds on which the government has begun to reestablish its legitimacy on an international stage, it is important to untangle the country’s complicated history, reflected in its many name changes. Before the British took power in Burma in 1824, the country was referred to as both Myanmar and Burma—the former in formal contexts and the latter more colloquially. As in many other colonial sagas, it was the British who decided to officially dub the country Burma. After the country gained independence in 1948, the name Burma lasted through a brief era of civilian democracy and on through the 1962 military coup. However, after great turmoil and the failure to hand power over to the National League for Democracy Party under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, who had rightfully won the election, the military leadership changed the name to the Union of Myanmar in 1989. They hoped that the new name, which they incorrectly claimed encompassed all of the ethnic minorities in the country, not just the majority Burmese, would once again draw the support of the people.
After the military government accumulated one of the world’s worst human rights records, including the state-sponsored slaughter of protesting monks in the 2007 Saffron Revolution, countries around the world rightfully shut their doors to the ruling regime and imposed harsh economic sanctions. Yet the last three years have seen the reversal of what seemed to be the unending abuse of the Burmese people by their government. Perhaps the government felt the tides changing with the Arab Spring or could no longer foresee an economic future under stringent international sanctions. Due to these compounding circumstances, the country held a general election in 2010, and former General Thein Sein was elected as the first civilian president in 49 years. Since his election, President Thein Sein has been called Burma’s Gorbachev, ushering in a post-junta era of reform that has included decreasing media censorship, releasing political prisoners, and allowing Aung San Su Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, to run for Parliament in last year’s by-elections.
On my visit to Burma this past December, the air of optimism that has accompanied these long sought-after changes was almost palpable. While a Burmese citizen would have likely been imprisoned two years ago for endorsing the National League for Democracy, NLD signs and offices now line roads throughout the country.  People spoke realistically about the changes, saying that the ingrained corruption in the military and the government certainly would not disappear overnight and that tensions still flare up between the ethnic minorities on the country’s borders. However, for the first time in 50 years, change was becoming a reality.
This past November, democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi spoke about the 1989 name change in an interview: “I still object to it. So I will always refer to his country as Burma, until the Burmese people decide what they want it to be called.” Even with the recent changes, it is understandable that it is currently still impossible for the nation’s democratic leaders to accept a name that represents the abuses of a totalitarian government. Yet Suu Kyi herself has adopted a mode of compromise recently, working with former generals such as Thein Sein to pave the way toward democracy. Thus, for the time being, the country still stands somewhere in between Burma and Myanmar, but both sides are gradually collaborating to support the country’s journey to reestablish a booming economy and democracy. The fledgling post-junta government will meet its first real test in 2015 when the first truly contested national elections are scheduled. If elections are allowed to proceed smoothly and Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy are able to legitimately campaign, it may be time for the world to fully embrace a reformed and legitimate Myanmar.

Huntington D. Lambert, the head of continuing education at Colorado State University and one of the leading voices in online education, will become the next dean of Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an email to faculty members Thursday.
Lambert will replace outgoing dean Michael Shinagel, who announced last September that he would be stepping down after almost four decades of leadership.
In his email Smith praised Lambert as a “bold innovator who possesses the rare combination of a strategic business sensibility and a true commitment to our academic mission.”
Lambert is the founder of CSU’s Global Campus, the first entirely online public university, and has had a long career in technology management. His appointment as dean of DCE comes less than a year after Harvard and MIT announced that they were joining forces to found a new online education platform called edX. Since last May, two dozen courses have been or are currently being offered by the platform, and six other institutions of higher education—including Georgetown and the University of Texas—have joined the venture.
When Lambert’s appointment officially begins at the end of April, he will oversee the Extension and Summer schools as well as a number of other DCE programs, with a focus on expanding DCE’s presence on the edX platform, according to Smith.
“At this exciting moment, when technology and education are combining in new and important ways here at Harvard, Lambert’s experience and track record of success are particularly welcome,” Smith wrote.
When outgoing dean Shinagel announced his departure last fall, he indicated that his decision to step aside came as the University wished to place greater emphasis on online coursework and find a new figure to lead the school for the next two decades. The search to replace Shinagel has been ongoing for more than two years, Smith wrote.
Neither Lambert nor Shinagel could be reached for comment Thursday.
Lambert, who served in a number of different capacities during his time at CSU, most recently oversaw 10,000 students in his role as Vice Provost of the Division of Continuing Education at the school. Prior to being named to that position, he helped to found the university’s Entrepreneurship Center and Office of Economic Development, among more than a dozen other initiatives.
Global Campus, the most successful venture from his tenure at CSU, boasts more than 7,000 enrolled students for the Spring 2013 semester. Since its founding in 2007, the online school has developed both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as a stand-alone state university.

When Harvard Medical School genetics professor George M. Church was interviewed by the German magazine Der Spiegel about his new book, he had no idea that a misinterpretation of something he said would set off a worldwide media firestorm.
While explaining the process by which scientists might one day clone a Neanderthal, a now-extinct sub-species closely related to the modern human, he mentioned that a human surrogate would need to be employed to carry it to term. In the book that Church cowrote with science author Ed Regis, “Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves,” he remarked that the surrogate would have to be an “extremely adventurous female human.”
Dozens of news outlets around the world misinterpreted the exchange as an indication that Church was actively looking for such a human and intended to perform the cloning procedure, when in reality he was proposing a hypothetical method to clone a Neanderthal. A headline from the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail, for example, read, “Wanted:’Adventurous woman’ to give birth to Neanderthal man—Harvard professor seeks mother for cloned cave baby.”
But cloning a Neanderthal was always only a theoretical possibility, Church said during an interview with The Crimson. His description of the process in both his book and the interview with Der Spiegel was far more complicated and speculative than many outlets indicated in their publications.
“It was a part of a very long and nuanced discussion which you can only have in a book,” Church said. “You can’t have it in a soundbite.”
Since the interview, Church has been contacted by many people who object to the concept of cloning, as well as women offering themselves as surrogates for the hypothetical operation.
“They’re still contacting me—hundreds of them,” he said. “Some sort of nerve gets hit. I was not taking sides on it.”
Church said he was surprised that he was not contacted by people questioning the plausibility of actually cloning a Neanderthal. He compared the suggestion that someone could birth a Neanderthal using existing technology with the claim that a quarterback could throw a 200-yard pass—something that is impossible given the length of a football field.
“But this, which is even more implausible, people didn’t detect,” Church said.
He said that while not all news organizations made the mistake, “almost all of the headlines were wrong.” The error was not simply a mistake in the translation between English and German, he said.
“I think the secondary resources feel a great deal more liberty,” Church said. “They don’t feel as constrained by the primary data. I’m not sure that’s a good thing.”

While J-Term is a time to get off campus for many Harvard students, winter athletes stay on campus to train and compete. This year, the wrestling team decided to devote some of its free time to community service.
Twice a week this January, the wrestling team volunteered for two charity programs—tutoring students at Mission Hill School in Boston and packing and sorting items for Cradles to Crayons.
“Our program is built on two pillars—integrity and discipline. And one of the things that go along with integrity is giving back to the community,” said Brennan M. Smith ’16.
The wrestling team’s commitment to community service is not new. Along with social and academic committees, the team has maintained a community outreach committee, currently headed by Shay I. Warren ’13.
“It’s a way of giving back after all that we’ve been given,” said Warren.
The wrestlers worked after school at the Mission Hill School with two groups of students helping with homework. While Harvard students often volunteer at the school through Phillips Brooks House Association programs, the number of available mentors falls during the holiday break. The wrestlers stepped in to fill that void.
“We give them something to look forward to at the end of their day,” said Smith.
While some of the wrestlers found the work challenging, they said they learned from the experience.
“A lot of times you forget what it’s like to be a kid,” said Warren. “It can be frustrating, but it’s a good chance to learn about people and how to motivate people to do something that’s good, but that they don’t want to do.”
Members of the team also volunteered for Cradles to Crayons, a program that provides underprivileged children up to age 12 with items that are difficult to come by like clothes, books, and toys.
Founded in Boston in 2002, Cradles to Crayons expanded to Philadelphia in 2006. As part of their service, wrestlers went to the factory to pack and sort items for distribution.
Members of the team said that the trips served a dual purpose—they not only helped the community, but also brought the team closer together.
“I think that a big part of it is us trying to focus on something bigger than ourselves,” said Warren. “The fact that we are all working hard for that greater good helps us all.

Renowned MIT physics professor and virtual education veteran Walter Lewin has added his popular course on electricity and magnetism to this spring’s edX class offerings, announced the online educational platform on Tuesday.
EdX, a not-for-profit venture launched jointly by Harvard and MIT in spring of 2012, aims to expand access to educational courses and revolutionize online and on-campus learning. Lewin’s course is the latest addition to edX’s spring selection, which includes new 2013 offerings such as “Justice” from Michael J. Sandel and “The Ancient Greek Hero” from Gregory Nagy.
Lewin’s course, MITx 8.02 Electricity and Magnetism, is a second semester introductory physics class that covers electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetism, and the nature of light as well as other topics like big-bang cosmology, superconductivity, and color perception. The course is based on the on-campus class that he taught at MIT in the spring of 2002 and will be accompanied by problem-solving sessions and interactive simulations on course material.
“My lectures in MIT have always been very unusual, very special,” said Lewin, who returned from retirement to work full-time on his edX courses. “Physics is my life, and teaching is in my blood.”
Known for his lively demonstrations and animated delivery, Lewin has been making his lectures available to students around the world for over two decades. In 1983, Lewin began offering instruction through MIT Cable TV, and twelve years later, the University of Washington TV station began screening his lectures to a broad audience of various ages.
More recently, Lewin has posted his lectures on MIT’s OpenCourseWare, iTunes, and YouTube. His courses on Newtonian mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and vibrations and waves have attracted international fame and front page acclaim from The New York Times, which coined the professor a “web star” in 2007. According to his profile on MIT’s website, his lectures reach almost two million people everyday.
Describing edX as an “unprecedented breakthrough” comparable to the invention of the printing press, he said that he predicts two, longer-term effects of virtual education through edX: first, that students enrolled at universities like Harvard and MIT may begin taking virtual versions of certain courses in place of traditional, in-person courses, and second, that students may bypass lower-quality colleges and universities and opt for virtual education instead.
“These certificates may have enormous impact on their lives,” said Lewin of students who successfully complete courses from edX, particularly those with limited access to higher education in their home countries.
Lewin’s physics research and dynamic style of teaching has attracted many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984 and MIT’s Everett Moore Baker Teaching Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2003. His course is currently open for enrollment and will begin on Feb. 18. He said that he is currently preparing a virtual course on mechanics for this fall and plans to offer a third course in the future.

Most people would not spend days strategizing how to win a foosball game, but in this year’s second annual Student Computational Challenge, teams were challenged to do just that and code a program to trump opponents in a virtual tournament.
James A. Damore, a second-year Ph.D. student in systems biology, and Bo Waggoner, a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science, beat seven other student teams Wednesday during the event, winning a pair of iPad Minis as reward.
“In the end, our solution was simple, but we were actually pretty confident it was optimal,” Damore said.
The challenge, which opened Monday morning in Maxwell Dworkin, required the teams to submit algorithms which then faced off in a round robin tournament. In the winners’ final implementation, Damore said he coded most of the algorithms while Waggoner designed methods to test and visualize their performance.
Pavlos Protopapas, a researcher at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science’s Institute for Applied Computational Science, helped organize the competition as a part of ComputeFest­—a week of Wintersession activities planned by the organization.
While last year’s challenge was an optimization problem for teams to solve on their own, Protopapas decided that a sports game would provide a more interactive experience for this year’s competitors.
“I wanted the challenge to be a little more dynamic, a little more fun,” Protopapas said.
In the game, students submitted a starting lineup of players, distributed as they wished across the virtual field. As the ball moved across the field, a server communicated that information to the students’ programs, which they could then use to reposition the players.
Damore and Waggoner’s strategy was to first simplify the problem, imagining a case where they could not reposition players. They found that the best solution was to place the most players in the midfield and then adapt that strategy to the more complicated problem.
“We had to test everything against different strategies,” Damore said. “It would be very easy to be blind to certain strategies and then lose to those in the competition.”
Protopapas said he designed the challenge so that it could be approached using a variety of methods. At the end of the competition, the top four teams presented and discussed their individual strategies.

Thomas G. Stemberg ’71, founder of the retail chain Staples and a prominent supporter of the Harvard mens’ basketball program, characterized the College’s handling of the Government 1310 cheating scandal as “Orwellian” in a personal letter addressed to University President Drew G. Faust.
In the letter, whose greeting read, “Dear Drew,” Stemberg leveled a harsh rebuke at the academic dishonesty investigation that brought down the two co-captains of a Harvard team with NCAA tournament prospects.
“Over 40 years as a student, an alumnus, and Harvard parent, I have never seen the need to write a letter of complaint,” Stemberg wrote in the opening line of his letter. “However, the University’s approach to and handling of the so-called ‘Congress’ cheating scandal compels me to write one.”
Stemberg declined to comment on the letter, which was dated Jan. 6 and obtained by The Crimson earlier this week. Stemberg’s criticism emerges near the close of an investigation that has ensnared about 125 students accused of inappropriately collaborating on a take-home final exam in the spring course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Harvard announced the massive cheating case at the end of August, and last week a Harvard spokesperson said that the College would make an announcement about the results of the case near the start of the spring semester.
In addition to sending his letter to Faust, Stemberg sent copies to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, Executive Director of the Harvard Alumni Association John P. Reardon, Jr. ’60, and members of the Harvard Corporation. All declined to comment on this article.
Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the correspondence on behalf of Faust.
Stemberg is listed on gocrimson.com as a co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Basketball, an organization of alumni that fundraises for the team.
He played a major role in revamping Harvard’s basketball program after former head coach Frank Sullivan was let go in 2007. With other alumni donors, he helped finance a salary increase to recruit current head basketball coach Tommy Amaker, who led the Crimson to its first March Madness appearance in 66 years last season. Star players Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13, who were instrumental in the team’s success last year, were named co-captains of the squad and expected by some to lead the Crimson to a third straight Ivy title this season.
But their prospects were derailed by Harvard’s Government 1310 investigation. Media outlets reported in September that both chose to withdraw from the College to minimize NCAA eligibility penalties as they awaited possible disciplinary consequences resulting from the scandal.
Stemberg wrote that he personally knows some of the approximately 125 accused students. In his letter, Stemberg classified the students embroiled in the scandal into two different categories: those who “clearly went too far, literally cutting and pasting their answers,” and those who “did no more than write answers from notes that were derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged.”
Stemberg slammed the University for dolling out the same punishment to both groups, dragging students “through a seemingly endless judicial process.” That process, Stemberg wrote, “damag[ed] the educational experience and the reputation of scores of innocent students.”
Stemberg also excoriated the way that assistant government professor Matthew B. Platt organized Government 1310, writing that the structure of the class confused students and contributed to the scope of the scandal.
“We had a professor who, like many the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assigns to teach undergraduates, was clearly not qualified to do so,” he wrote. At press time, Platt could not be reached for comment.
According to Stemberg, Platt’s inconsistent instructions left many confused about the course’ s collaboration policy.
“If the message [that collaboration was not allowed] was so clearly expressed, why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session, a per se violation of the professor’s seeming intent?” Stemberg wrote. “If they did not get the message, could one expect the students to understand it?”
Stemberg also wrote that his dissatisfaction with the way the scandal was handled was informed by discussion with two former Deans of the College.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, dean of the College from 1995 to 2003, has criticized the College’s handling of the investigation in several articles and blog posts. In an interview with The Crimson, Lewis said that he and Stemberg commiserated about the scandal when passing each other at their courtside seats at Harvard basketball games this season.
“He read my Huffington Post piece,” Lewis said. “The first time he walked past me, he kind of threw up his hands.”
Lewis said he is disappointed that the scandal has not resulted in a University-wide conversation about the policies and culture surrounding undergraduate teaching at Harvard.
“I continue to be principally troubled that we’re not having, haven’t had yet, and there’s no indication that we’re going to have, a faculty conversation about how faculty conduct their courses,” he said.
Lewis echoed Stemberg’s complaint that the organization of the course, seen by many students as an easy ‘A’, fostered confusion about the limits of appropriate collaboration.
“How is it that hundreds of students knew the way this course was run, and nobody in the Government department knew or if they did know why didn’t anybody stop it from happening?” Lewis said. “When the course is sufficiently lax about its own standards, in 125 alleged cases of overlapping language, it’s very hard to figure out what everybody’s good faith expectations were about they were supposed to do.”
For his part, Stemberg saw little evidence of “good faith” on the side of Harvard administrators.
He sounded a note of dismay in the closing line of his letter: “As an alumnus, how can one come to any conclusion other than the University has a bloated bureaucracy so intent on being politically correct, that its students and its mission are forgotten?”

Below is the text of a personal letter obtained by The Crimson this week that was sent by prominent alumnus Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 to University President Drew G. Faust. Stemberg's mailing address, which was printed in the header of the letter, has been omitted.
January 6, 2013
Drew G. Faust
President
Harvard University
University Hall
Cambridge, MA 02138
Dear Drew:
Over 40 years as a student, an alumnus, and Harvard parent, I have never seen the need to write a letter of complaint. However, the University’s approach to and handling of the so-called “Congress” cheating scandal compels me to write one.
I know a number of the affected undergraduates, and my son knows many others. Yet I write this only after discussing the matter with two former Deans of Harvard College, who not only confirmed my dissatisfaction, but amplified it.
We had a professor who, like many the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assigns to teach undergraduates, was clearly not qualified to do so. After several exams for which open collaboration was encouraged, he changed the rules. One was told that on this particular take home exam, one could not collaborate with professors, teaching fellows “and others.” One would suppose this meant students.
If the message was so clearly expressed, why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session, a per se violation of the professor’s seeming intent? If they did not get the message, could one expect the students to understand it?
While some students clearly went too far, literally cutting and pasting their answers, others did no more than write answers from notes that were derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged. Itwas surely appropriate to punish the former group.
To then go through a seemingly endless judicial process that found virtually all of the latter group to be guilty, damaging the educational experience and the reputation of scores of innocent students was Orwellian. And then to let off only those students who lied and said others had copied from them insults the word VERITAS.
As an alumnus, how can one come to any conclusion other than the University has a bloated bureaucracy so intent on being politically correct, that its students and its mission are forgotten?
Respectfully,
Thomas G. Stemberg ‘71

Speaking at the second annual National Collegiate Research Conference, MIT physics professor Walter H. G. Lewin kicked off the three-day symposium with a bang—the big bang. Lewin delivered the keynote speech on astrophysics before a group of science, humanities, and social science researchers during the event, which focused on the theme of collaboration in research.
The conference brought more than 200 students from dozens of schools to Harvard to present their research, participate in workshops, and learn from peers and professionals.
The Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association, the student group that organized the event, planned the conference in an effort to bring together a variety of student researchers and encourage diversity in research subjects.
To this end, the HCURA board worked closely with the Office for Undergraduate Research, which has historically represented scientific research on campus.
“We definitely see a preponderance of science proposals, but our office’s effort is to look at research across disciplines,” said Gregory A. Llacer, director of the undergraduate research office.
This year in particular, the conference encompassed research in the humanities and social sciences in addition to work in the hard sciences and quantitative studies.
Even in the course of his discourse on astrophysics, Lewin alluded to history of science, environmental policy, and gender disparities in science.
Chris E. Hernandez ’13 also embraced this focus on curricular diversity, presenting research on the impact of incriminating evidence on the memories of witnesses.
The variety of disciplines present at the conference was evident in its speaker lineup as well. While Lewin, a physics professor, delivered the keynote address, the roster of speakers scheduled to give talks at the conference includes scholars drawn from psychology, economics, and biomedicine.
When selecting participants for the conference, the admissions committee strove to represent schools beyond just Harvard.
Ultimately Harvard undergraduates made up one third of the event’s attendees.
“We really wanted this to be a conference by students for students,” said Leandra A. Barnes ’13, co-president of HCURA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk playing in the Senior Bowl this week and entering his name into the NFL Draft pool, The Back Page takes a look at what scouts have been saying about the Crimson’s best prospect.
CBS Sports:
Like many other drafting websites, CBS has forecasted Juszczyk as playing fullback in the pros. The Harvard tight end is bigger than all the other fullbacks on the rankings and is fifth overall, trailing four Division-I prospects—three of which are from Big Six conference schools. Their experts project five drafted fullbacks, with another five that could possibly go late in the seventh round.
Yahoo Sports:
Like CBS, Yahoo lists the former Crimson star as a fullback and has him ranked in the same spot. Yahoo expects him to be drafted in the seventh round, which is typical for the fullback position. Also of note here: Juszczyk runs a faster 40 than the top two tight ends on the board, Stanford’s Zach Ertz and Notre Dame’s Tyler Eifert.
ESPN Sports:
Seen here, ESPN does not have much information on Juszczyk. Since neither the NFL Combine nor any ‘pro days’ for seniors have started, the lack of information is not surprising. The website’s Insider scouting profiles have him listed as the tenth-ranked fullback with a grade of 30 that is similar to the five players above him. The grade of 30 describes a ‘borderline draft prospect’ that “certainly do not have the full package in terms of NFL talent…will usually rate in the bottom third of players at his position and will be considered a later round draft choice or un-drafted free agent.”
Detroit Lions Draft:
This website, dedicated to the drafting process of the Detroit Lions, had writers on hand to attend each Senior Bowl practice and make notes on the players involved. It noted that Juszczyk “has some Vonta Leach in him” and that the “one thing that stands out with Juszczyk is his genuine love of contact and his aggressiveness.”
Others of Note:
College Sports Journal, a scouting website, has Juszczyk as its 100th rated pro prospect from the Football Championship Subdivision. Juszczyk is joined on the list, which was created in advance of the 2012 season, by three other Ivy League players: then-Cornell junior Jeff Mathews, then-Princeton senior Caraun Reid, and then-Cornell senior Shane Savage, who were ranked 10th, 39th, and 71th on the list, respectively.
NFL Future, a website dedicated to discussing draft prospects, has Juszczyk currently as its 14th ranked tight end, ranked immediately ahead of Nebraska senior Ben Cotton. Juszczyk is expected, according to the website, to go somewhere in the fifth or sixth round.
Optimum Scouting, another drafting website, sat down with each player for interviews. The writer was surprised that Juszczyk, who predominantly played the slot receiver position, hasn’t gotten an invitation to the NFL Combine and noted that “he should end up one.” He added that he thought Juszczyk was more in the 4.5 range than the 4.73 listed on other sites when discussing his 40-yard dash times, “which would be really impressive for the H-back/slot TE prospect”
NFL Draft 101 scouted drills and wrote this about Juszczyk: “Shown soft hands with the ability to make tough catches, a definite H-back type. Blocking is a concern and he will need to develop his techniques.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Jan. 31, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that tight end Kyle Juszczyk was the only Ivy League player to make scouting website College Sports Journal's pre-2012 season list of 100 top-rated prospects. In fact, Juszczyk was one of four Ivy League players ranked in the list.

As the spring semester begins, so does the racing season for Erika Veidis, a sophomore on the Harvard track and field team who specializes in the 800-meter race. But for this Pfoho resident, there is another Crimson race taking place.
Not only is she dating sophomore Alexander “Zander” Bonorris on the lightweight crew team, her close friend and roommate Molly Renfer races alongside her on the track team.
In an effort to see who would win a race for Veidis’s heart, we had the trio participate in The Back Page’s “For Love or the Game” series. We asked Veidis a medley of questions and then posed those same questions to Bonorris and Renfer to see who knew her better. So who prevailed in this heat? Who sped to the finish, the rower or the racer?Erika Veidis, sophomore on track team
Favorite athlete: Amantle Montsho, Allyson Felix, or Alysia Montano
Pre-race jam: "Welcome 2 Detroit" - Trick Trick feat. Eminem or "The Kiss" from Last of the Mohicans (in high school, "Russian Privjet" - Basshunter)
Secret talent: Chugging water quickly, guitar
TV show: I Love Lucy, Modern Family, The Office, Girls
Favorite late-night food: Cookies (or chocolate bourbon pecan pie from Petsi Pies)

After major changes in the Buffalo Bills organization, the future of Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 with the franchise remains muddled. The Bills, if looking to go in a different direction behind center, would save half a million dollars by cutting him. The team has a new coaching staff, headlined by former Syracuse head coach Doug Marrone, and a new president of football operations (Russ Brandon) with a possible replacement for current general manager Buddy Nix coming. Coming up on the four-year anniversary of his signing with the Bills, Fitzpatrick’s future is uncertain but his impact on the team over the past four years is clear.Before signing with the Bills in February 2009, Fitzpatrick was an NFL journeyman. Brief stints with the St. Louis Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals showed flashes of good play—Fitzpatrick is one of seven quarterbacks to throw for 300 yards in his first game—but he was let go by the Bengals to make way for the return of a previously-injured Carson Palmer. The Amish Rifle signed with the Bills as a backup, sitting the first six games of the season until starter Trent Edwards went down with an injury in an October game against the New York Jets. Fitzpatrick finished that game, a 16-13 Bills win, and was named the starter exactly one month later. The next season, after being forced to sit behind Edwards the first two games, Fitzpatrick was named the starter again and has started 39 of the 40 games since (one missed due to injury).
Fitzpatrick signed a massive, six-year, $59 million extension in October 2011 but has not been able to provide the Bills with wins to back up his contract. Fitzpatrick is 12-20 over his past two years with the team, throwing for 7,232 yards and 48 touchdowns during that span but also turning the ball over 49 times. Although surrounded by elite running back talent in C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson, Fitzpatrick has struggled with throws down the field and the lack of a second wide receiving option after Stevie Johnson. However, he provided a ray of light for a franchise that had dealt with the subpar quarterback play of J.P. Losman and Trent Edwards (a combined 71 turnovers against only 49 scores in the six years prior to Fitzpatrick) but the team’s commitment to him had adverse effects.
By committing to Fitzpatrick—a 28-year old quarterback entering his prime at the time of signing—the Bills decided to not pursue an alternative through the draft or in free agency. The team has historically struggled to lure free agents to Buffalo (the Mario Williams pickup notwithstanding), meaning that the team’s decision to go with Fitzmagic was essentially a choice between him and the riskiness of the draft. In the two years since the Bills made Fitzpatrick their starter, they have held top-10 picks in the NFL draft (not including the year he started 10 games—where drafting Spiller in the first round has proven to be a solid selection). With the third pick in the 2011 draft, the Bills drafted Alabama defensive end Marcell Dareus—the only non-Pro Bowler among the seven top picks. In doing so, they passed up on first-round quarterbacks Jake Locker, Blaine Gabbert, and Christian Ponder as well as second-round selections Andy Dalton and Colin Kaepernick. In 2012, the Bills selected South Carolina cornerback Stephon Gilmore but their pick preceded only three quarterback selections in the next three rounds—Cleveland’s Brandon Weeden, Denver’s Brock Osweiler, and Seattle’s Russell Wilson.
Pursuing Fitzpatrick meant eschewing these other possible selections. Although only in their first or second years in the league, an in-prime Fitzpatrick has proved better than several of those selections. Ponder, Gabbert, Weeden and Locker have alternated flashes of greatness with predominant mediocrity and Osweiler has not left the bench behind Peyton Manning. It is easy to second guess the Bills for not drafting a backup quarterback since their current backups, Tyler Thigpen and Tavaris Jackson, are aging veterans with little upside, but Dalton, Kaepernick, or Wilson—the most successful quarterbacks the Bills could have drafted—would have been reaches in the top 10.
In summary, although Fitzpatrick has not taken the leap that the Bills expected when given the extension, he has provided a serviceable replacement for a team that has struggled elsewhere. Free agent signings Mario and Kyle Williams have similarly failed to live up to their contracts and injuries have made the rotating Spiller-Jackson backfield unreliable on a week-to-week basis. Entering a weak quarterback draft, Fitzpatrick will likely be given one more season as the starter before a stronger draft class, headlined by the possibility of Heisman winner Johnny Manziel, comes in 2013. Committing to the Harvard alum delayed the Bills from entering a long rebuilding process, but in view of the franchise’s previous quarterback play, provided a dramatic improvement under center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s basketball team welcomes Dartmouth to Lavietes Pavilion Saturday for the Crimson’s Ivy League home opener, the Big Green will look to prove once again that non-conference records can be misleading.
Despite having won five more games than Dartmouth before the start of Ancient Eight play, Harvard fell behind in the second half at Leede Arena two weeks ago, but clutch shooting down the stretch put the Crimson on top by 10 as freshman point guard Siyani Chambers netted a season-high 22 points.
“They’re going to think they can beat us, especially playing how we played against them last time,” co-captain guard Christian Webster said.
After the win against Dartmouth, Harvard closed out its non-conference schedule in Memphis last week. The Crimson mounted a second-half comeback after falling behind by 16 points at the half, but foul trouble late in the game allowed the favored Tigers to pull out a 60-50 win.
Harvard struggled when Chambers—the second-half catalyst in the win over Dartmouth and the Crimson’s second leading scorer with 12.7 points per game—was pulled late in the game after committing his fourth personal foul. When in the game, Chambers had trouble holding onto the ball, committing a season-high seven turnovers and failing to make up for it with only four points.
“We need to do better with taking care of the ball, we need to do better with keeping Dartmouth off the backboard, and we need to better in our post defense,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m hopeful that we can see some improvements and some carryover from the second half of Memphis going into Dartmouth on Saturday.”
After the loss of its top four scorers from last season, the young team spent the first half of its schedule in search of its identity. While consistently relying on Chambers and sophomore wing Wes Saunders—who leads the team and the Ivy League with 16.1 points per game—the Crimson has depended on contributions from a number of players throughout the season.
The young squad has struggled with consistency, especially in keeping up the level of play for a full 40 minutes. In losses against Connecticut and Memphis, Harvard remained in contention well into the second half before allowing its opponents to run away and close out the game.
“[Inconsistency is] a factor and a function of youth,” Amaker said. “Usually consistency and youth don’t go hand in hand, and that’s kind of where we’ve been.”
On Saturday, the Crimson will have to contend with Dartmouth’s 6’9” leading scorer, Gabas Maldunas—who averages 11 points per game. In the first game against Harvard this year, the forward grabbed a team-high six rebounds and added 10 points in the paint.
The Big Green had four scorers in double digits that day, with freshmen forward Connor Boehm and guard Alex Mitola leading the way with 11 points each. But Dartmouth could not contend with a hot shooting Harvard offense, which went 27 for 43 from the field, shooting over 60 percent for the second straight game.
Through the first half of the season, the Big Green and the Crimson have been living out opposite stories. Harvard tops the Ivy League leaderboard in points per game and field goal percentage, while Dartmouth sits in last place in both categories.
With 13 games left to play, Amaker said Harvard is looking to take it one game at a time. In the Ivy League—where the Crimson will face each other team twice—one conference win or loss can make or break a title run.
“This part of the season is what really matters when it comes down to it,” Webster said. “Everybody is starting all over.”
Having faced off less than two weeks ago, both teams will look to improve on their last performances and learn from the result. With one Ivy League game in the books, Harvard will look to rebound from the loss against Memphis and start a three-game home stand with a win while the Big Green will look to build on its 82-40 blowout over Colby-Sawyer last week.
“Hopefully we can get off to a good start,” Amaker said. “If we can make sure we’re not picking up silly fouls especially in the early stages of the game, I would feel like we’ve done a pretty decent job to begin our conference home stand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two weeks free of intercollegiate obligations, the Harvard women’s basketball team looks to pick up right where it left off.
On Jan. 12, the Crimson opened up Ivy League play with a comprehensive win over Dartmouth, 88-66, at Lavietes Pavilion. This Saturday, Harvard hopes for a similar result in Hanover.
“We’re dying to play,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I would guess the same with Dartmouth. The two week break isn’t ideal, so we’re pretty excited to be playing.”
Harvard will be seeking its seventh straight win over the Big Green. The Crimson (10-5, 1-0 Ivy) heads into Saturday’s matchup tied with Princeton for the Ivy League’s best overall record. Dartmouth (2-13, 0-1 Ivy) is tied with Columbia for the conference’s worst.
“Their program is kind of in the rebuilding stages, but the Harvard-Dartmouth rivalry goes back so many years,” junior guard Christine Clark said. “It’s always a competitive game, and we always have to be on our best game to beat them.”
In Harvard’s last outing against Dartmouth, the Crimson jumped out to a 16-point advantage in the first half and extended the lead in the second. Clark and senior forward Victoria Lippert led all scorers with 22 and 19 points, respectively.
“Both [Lippert] and I really took what the defense gave us,” Clark said. “And we just had great team offense, working the ball around, which opened [Lippert and me] up for drives and pull-ups.”
For the third time this season, Clark earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors. She currently leads all Ivy scorers with 16.9 points per game.
The Crimson’s reserves also put up big numbers against the Big Green as Harvard’s bench combined for 37 points. In just eight minutes on the floor, freshman guard Shilpa Tummala contributed a career-high 10 points as she shot 4-for-4 from the field.
“It doesn’t surprise me when [Tummala] comes in and shoots 4-for-4,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s capable of that.”
The freshman has begun to show improvements on the court as she continues to rehab a shoulder injury that she sustained in high school.
On Saturday, the Crimson will try to contain sharp-shooting senior guard Faziah Steen, who led all Dartmouth scorers with 18 points and recorded a game-high five steals two weeks ago at Lavietes. Steen is the sole senior on a young Big Green squad.
“She’s one of the better players in the league,” Delaney-Smith said of Steen. “We could have done a better job on her. She’s fast, she’s grown, and she’s always been a tremendous shooter, and now she’s taking it to the hole pretty well, so we’ve got to adjust.”
Steen will share the backcourt duties with junior point guard Nicola Zimmer, who was out with a knee injury two weeks ago. Steen, Zimmer, and junior Eve Zelinger are Dartmouth’s only upperclassmen.
Freshman forward Lakin Roland led Dartmouth’s underclassmen corps two weeks ago, coming off the bench to score 13 points. Sophomores Tia Dawson and Abbey Schmitt may also challenge Harvard’s backcourt tomorrow.
“I think that on a given night, they’ve got players that are up and down. Anyone can do anything,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think Tia Dawson is one of the more challenging players in the league, so we have to pay attention to her. But they’re sort of having an inconsistent year.”
Tomorrow will mark the second time in Delaney-Smith’s coaching tenure the Crimson has played the same opponent in back-to-back games. In January 2008, Harvard also opened up the Ivy League season with two games against Dartmouth.
“There’s more familiarity,” Delaney-Smith said about playing Dartmouth in consecutive games. “The scout is much easier.”
Saturday is the first of a three-game road stand for Harvard. The Crimson will travel to New Haven and Providence next weekend to meet two new Ivy rivals. In Hanover, Harvard will focus on defensive details against a familiar opponent.
“Scoring 88 points in a game, you should be able to beat most teams when you can score that much, so our focus [these two weeks] was defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “We found some areas where we have to make some adjustments.”
Clark agreed that her team has issues it needs to begin to address.
“We need to keep improving on defense and rebounds,” Clark added. “I think we can improve on what we did last game; that’s kind of our goal, beyond winning.”

January 20, 1910: Original College Wall Discovered
In the southeastward course of the excavations for the Cambridge subway, the southwest corner of the original "Harvard College," built in 1638, has been unearthed. On December 8, 1909, about 40 feet of the wall of Edward Goffe's House, which stood on an adjoining lot, was discovered a little to the west of Wadsworth House, running parallel with the street. The piece just discovered is about 40 yards below Wadsworth House.
The corner is almost directly opposite the entrance to Holyoke House, and is in a perfect state of preservation. It is constructed of field stones. The wall running to the east appears to extend under the sidewalk around the "College Yard." The upper courses of both walls leading from the corner were removed years ago when the water mains were installed along Massachusetts avenue.
January 26, 1942: Yale Grad Taken For Nazi Agent Photoing Widener
Proof of Harvard's alertness in matters of defense was afforded Saturday by the apprehension of a suspicious-looking character in the act of taking a picture of Widener with a foreign camera. Accused of being a Nazi agent, the culprit was taken into custody by the Yard Cops.
Further quizzing by Arthur Wild '26, head of the University News Office, exonerated the captive of foreign connections, however. He turned out to be a harmless Yale grad seeing the sights.
January 22, 1948: Icy Torrents and Collapsible Roofs Give Examination Blues New Theme
Uncounted bruised rumps and one crushed roof joined the weather's victim list yesterday in the watery aftermath of the worst ice and snow blitz to hit Cambridge in a generation.
The storm has bombarded the area with a weight of 45 pounds per square foot, according to an estimate of the Blue Hills Observatory of Harvard, splitting the roof of Hollis Hall yesterday, and sending ice water cascading down the four story stair well.
Waste paper baskets proved ineffective in stemming the cold shouldered flood as it ripped away ceilings and laid a slippery coat down Hollis stairs.
Friday, January 24, 1958: Freshman Applicants Increase 20 Percent
Applications for admission to next year's Freshman class have increased approximately twenty per cent over last year, David D. Henry '41, Director of Admissions, reported yesterday.
Since early in September, Henry said, the Admissions Office has received 3400 applications from public and private school students, 500 more than were submitted by January 15, 1957.
January 20, 1967: Cliffies Pay More for Hamburgers As Graduate Center Meets Inflation
The Radcliffe Graduate Center, daily lunchroom of at least 250 Cliffies, has succumbed to inflation and raised its prices.
For the past few years, Cliffies have been allowed to eat in the graduate cafeteria as an alternative to having lunch in their own dorms. They are given an allotment of 80 cents per day, which was ample in the days when hamburgers were 30 cents, cottage cheese a nickel, and ice cream and fruit, only a dime.
But now, the allotment has stayed the same, but most of the prices have gone up five cents per item. Hamburgers now cost 35 cents, and the Cliffies who like two (without the caloric rolls, of course,) will just have to skip the salad, or pay the extra in cash.
