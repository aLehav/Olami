After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares for its season opener against Stanford, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for sophomore forward Weisner Perez.
2015-2016 Recap:
Perez's freshman year stats (2.6 points and 2.2 rebounds a game) do not leap off of the page. In contrast to classmates Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson, who started nearly the entire season, he played 20 or more minutes just once, scoring a season-high 15 points against No. 4 Kansas in December.
Yet, it was the contest against the Jayhawks that gave an indication as to what Perez could be for the Crimson. The freshman earned a reputation as a scrapper in limited playing time, competing hard on the offensive boards and showing deft touch from the midrange. His 13 rebounds in 18 minutes against Ryerson demonstrated his ability to bang with bigger players, and his rebounding rate was comparable to what All-Ivy center Zena Edosomwan put up in his first two years.
All the rebounding prowess in the world didn't earn Perez much court time, however. Stuck behind three seniors in the frontcourt rotation, his struggles grasping the intricacies of Amaker's complex defensive scheme limited his playing time in Ivy League play. The freshman saw more than 10 minutes just four times in 14 league contests, with defense largely the culprit.
Important Next Steps:
With a murky future (see below), Perez can focus on a couple of important areas in preparation for the upcoming season:
1.Expanding his range — In his first season, Perez rarely stepped behind the three-point arc, making just three triples all season. He preferred to operate from the deep midrange, but if he can expand his range to the three-point line, he could give Amaker the coach's first true pick-and-pop threat since Kyle Casey '13-'14, something no other forward on the roster can claim to offer.
2. Speeding up the footwork — When Perez struggled on defense, it was often because he got stuck out of position, coming up too high against an opposing pick-and-roll. Since his size deficit (Perez is just 6'6") won't change overnight, he has to be quicker to be a more effective defender
2016-2017 Outlook:
There is only one constant in next year's frontcourt for the Crimson: Edosomwan. After a breakout junior season where he was the focal point of the offense, the senior is certain to be a big offensive and defensive focus for the Crimson this year. Foul trouble limited his minutes in 2015-2016, but Amaker will likely expect him to play upwards of 30 minutes a game at the center position next year.
Behind him, there are no clear answers. Junior Chris Egi got the majority of the backup minutes this year but didn't show sufficient offensive touch to have the job locked up for next year. A trio of freshmen four-star recruits come in to challenge for the job and all come with higher offensive praise than Perez did as a freshmen.
Amidst this chaos, Perez can find his groove as a change-of-pace small-ball four. It is unlikely that he can play alongside Edosomwan for long stretches against every opponent, but he is a valuable counterbalance to the junior. If his jumper improves, he will be the only forward that can punish teams who double Edosomwan inside and the two together would be a force on the offensive glass.
Whether Perez can realize this vision of himself in an offseason is yet to be seen, however. Most likely he will compete with Egi to be the backup to a freshman starter alongside Edosomwan, a battle he can certainly win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares for its season opener against Stanford, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for sophomore point guard Tommy McCarthy.
2015-2016 Recap:
Sophomore Tommy McCarthy was thrust into the fire from the opening whistle of the year. Originally expected to back up Chambers, McCarthy was given the starting role when Chambers suffered an ACL injury in the offseason and elected to leave campus to preserve his eligibility. The Southern California native’s job got that much harder when, in the season’s second game, presumed backup junior Matt Fraschilla went down with an ACL tear himself.
McCarthy struggled initially, making over half his shots just twice in the first two months of the season. In the season's third game against UMass, he missed all 10 shots and had five turnovers against just one assist. When he followed that up with five turnovers and no assists against Boston College, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called out the freshman in the ensuing press conference.
As the year went on, the rookie improved. He never found his groove inside the arc but made 41 triples on the year at a 36 percent clip. He cut down on his turnovers (finishing with more than four just once in Ivy League play) and before going down with a concussion in the season's penultimate week of practice, averaged 19 points and 5.5 assists in helping Harvard split a road matchup with the Gentleman's C's.
Important Next Steps:
Going into next season, there are three main areas McCarthy can improve in:
1.On-ball defense — The team's guards were called out multiple times in postgame interviews by Amaker for their inability to keep their opponents in front of them on the perimeter, and McCarthy was a chief culprit. If the sophomore can nail down his defensive assignment, he will have a better shot of fighting off freshman Bryce Aiken (see below) and securing the backup job.
2.Finishing at the rim — The freshman shot under 32 percent inside the arc last season and struggled to finish over bigger bodies in the paint. Put simply, that is a perilously low mark.
3.Taking care of the ball — Throwing the ball away on offense frustrates Amaker more than anything else in his point guards. McCarthy, who got in trouble throwing long outlet passes over the heads of his streaking teammates, can be more effective by being more patient.
2016-2017 Outlook:
McCarthy's future with the team is unclear. As discussed in more detail here, McCarthy finds himself in a bit of a trap. Chambers, the three-year starter, is returning from a year off as the presumptive starter at the position, with four-star recruit Aiken looming as a threat for the backup job. As if that wasn't enough, captain Corbin Miller '15-'17 spent time at the point last year and Fraschilla is back as well, meaning that any minutes that McCarthy gets will have to be well-earned.
That said, the sophomore should be penciled in as the backup going into the offseason. He is more dynamic than Miller (albeit a slightly worse shooter) and, if he cuts down the turnovers, can thrive as an off-ball slasher alongside Chambers. He will struggle to fend off Aiken, who already profiles as a better on-ball defender, but will have an edge by virtue of Tommy Amaker's reluctance to give freshmen substantial playing time.
One thing to watch for McCarthy is whether Amaker shows himself to be more open to going small in 2016-17. Historically the coach has liked to play two-big lineups for defensive reasons, spacing be damned. With the exception of the 2012-2013 season, when Harvard's four-out lineup sparked it to the Ivy title, this hasn't been a problem, as Amaker has had the personnel to play two big men effectively. With a green frontcourt next season, he may not, but if he chooses to stick with it, sophomore Corey Johnson and junior Andre Chatfield will soak up almost all the minutes at the two. This limits the potential for two point guard lineups that would give McCarthy a greater chance at the floor and could be a ceiling on his participation in the offense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares for its season opener against Stanford, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for sophomore shooting guard Robbie Feinberg.


2015-2016 Recap:
Feinberg had a mostly anonymous season at the end of the bench in Cambridge. He played in just two games—against Bryant and Ryerson, two of Harvard’s biggest blowouts of the year—during the final minutes and attempted just two shots, missing both. Along with fellow sophmore James McLean, he struggled to get onto the floor and lagged behind classmates Tommy McCarthy, Corey Johnson, and Weisner Perez, each of whom saw meaningful playing time during their first seasons.
This isn’t to say that the season wasn’t a success for Feinberg, who was one of the first walk-ons that the team has taken during coach Tommy Amaker’s time in Cambridge. Over the last four years, only Charlie Anastasi ’15—often the team’s last big off the bench—has walked onto the team; in both cases, early-season departures of star players (Chambers this year, Brandyn Curry ’13-’14 and Kyle Casey ’13-’14 in 2012) paved the way for fresh blood.
Indeed, Anastasi (see below) is a model for what Feinberg can both expect and work towards over the next couple years.
Important Next Steps:
As a relatively big shooting guard (6’4”, 200 pounds), Feinberg should seek to maximize his value to the team by working on becoming a 3-and-D wing:
1.Perimeter Defense — During Amaker’s tenure, it has been easier for defense-first players to earn playing time than vice versa. Over the course of the 2015-2016 season, when injuries forced Amaker to start McCarthy and Johnson in an uncharacteristic all-freshman backcourt, was an aberration. Knowing this, Feinberg should strive to make defense, which is (caution: overgeneralization here) more effort and technique than offense, his calling card.
2.Shooting From the Corners — In the NBA, the best way for an offensively limited player to gain his keep on that end is to develop into a serviceable corner three marksman. If he is good enough, he can keep defenses honest and create spacing without being asked to do much more. Although Amaker’s movement offense rarely stations players in the corner, Feinberg can make his most compelling case for playing time by pitching himself as this type of player.
2016-2017 Outlook:
The simple truth is that Feinberg is going to struggle to get playing time not only next year, but in the three that come. Anastasi, who admittedly joined the team a year later than Feinberg, never saw anything but spot minutes at the end of Amaker’s bench, falling behind younger teammates who were more heralded recruits.
This isn’t to say that Feinberg’s cause is hopeless, nor that he cannot make an impact. Anastasi was routinely praised by teammates for his work during practice pushing the team as a veteran leader. If you slacked off, teammates noted, Anastasi’s effort would make it clear. Feinberg is be part of an extremely young team this year, and his practice attitude and work ethic may go a long way with Amaker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for freshman point guard James McLean.


2015-2016 Recap:
Like fellow sophomore Robbie Feinberg, McLean operated mostly in cleanup duty as a freshman. Both he and Feinberg were only subbed in twice all season—to close games against Bryant and Ryerson, nonconference contests that the Crimson won by a combined 41 points.
As a point guard, McLean’s playing time situation was slightly more complicated than Feinberg’s, however. Both were stuck behind classmates who started nearly every game (Tommy McCarthy at the one and Corey Johnson at the two) but McLean’s path was cleared out by ACL injuries to Chambers, the presumptive starter, and backup junior Matt Fraschilla.
McLean’s struggles to get onto the floor, while not encouraging, were in some ways unsurprising. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker puts a high priority on perimeter defense, a core part of the program’s identity, and is reluctant to play freshmen at the position. McCarthy was elevated to a starting role more out of need than anything else, and even he sat long stretches behind junior Corbin Miller, an inferior playmaker but steadier defender.
Important Next Steps:
Facing a bottleneck at the point (see below), McLean can look to Fraschilla and Alex Nesbitt ’15 as inspiration for his future role on the team.
1.Learn The Offense — Both players were offensively limited (read: unable to take defenders off the dribble or shoot from deep) but managed to garner significant playing time in Amaker’s offense by cutting their turnovers almost to nil. McLean’s cleanest path to playing time is to emulate this approach, learning how to operate in the Amaker offense without ever giving the ball away
2.Improve Defensive Footwork — Harvard coach Tommy Amaker expressed his frustration with the team’s defensive performance in the offseason, noting that with an all-freshman backcourt it was hard for the team to contain opposing perimeter threats like Princeton’s Steven Cook and Yale’s Makai Mason. With the exception of Chambers, most of the point guards ahead of McLean are mediocre defensively and his continued improvement on that end will be crucial in his efforts to get more playing time.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Despite being the recruited athlete of the two, McLean faces a steeper path to playing time than Feinberg. The point guard situation in Cambridge next year will be very crowded, with Chambers, McCarthy, Fraschilla, and Miller all returning ahead of McLean in the pecking order. Four-star recruit Bryce Aiken presumably will come in already ahead, while two-star recruit Christian Juzang should have plenty of chances to prove himself in preseason practices.
Amongst the logjam, McLean realistically has a slim chance of ever starting for the Crimson. While three of the aforementioned players will graduate next year, McCarthy, Aiken, and Juzang aren’t going anywhere. To earn backup minutes, McLean will have to likely outperform two or more three-star recruits moving forward. This season should thus be an excellent one for McLean to learn and develop as he builds towards becoming a steady hand at the point.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete.. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for sophomore shooting guard Corey Johnson.
2015-2016 Recap:
Johnson's freshman year exceeded all expectations. From the first press conference—when Harvard coach Tommy Amaker made multiple references to Johnson while staying mum on the rest of the freshmen—to the penultimate weekend of the year, when he poured in 24 points on 15 shots against Brown, Johnson impressed across the board. He started in nearly every game, averaging just under 10 points a contest and setting Harvard's record for three-pointers made by a freshman.
What was most impressive about the record was that Johnson made few efficiency sacrifices to get there, shooting just under 40 percent from deep while jacking up six treys a contest. He made five or more threes on three separate occasions, including the second game of the season against Providence, when he announced himself to a national audience by pouring in 17 points on 11 shots. Johnson continued to play well on the biggest stages all year, putting in 11 threes in the team's run to the finals of the Diamond Head Classic.
For all his success shooting, Johnson resembled the typical freshman in the other stages of the game. He admitted late in the year that defense didn't come as naturally to him and it wasn't until the end of Ivy League play that he began to use the right angles to effectively force his mark towards the baseline and close off driving lanes. He was a far better scorer than playmaker, averaging a pedestrian 2.1 assists per 40 minutes, and was uncharacteristically mediocre at the free throw line—making just 68 percent, a mark Amaker classified as unacceptable at the end of the year.
Important Next Steps:
With Johnson's starting spot all but assured (see below), he should work on rounding out his game with an eye on future growth:
1.Becoming a Shadow — Johnson's main area of improvement is perimeter defense. At 6'5", he has the potential to play three in smaller lineups, but only if he improves his agility along with his core and lower body strength. His foot speed will always be an issue, but he can circumvent that issue by taking better angles and improving his lateral movement.
2.The In-Between Game — As unsexy as the mid-range jumper is, Johnson should work on it. He will have an easier time finishing if opponents have to respect him pulling up and draining a 10 to 15 foot jump shot—which should be automatic given his talent shooting the ball.
3. Developing The Handle — Johnson showed good passing instincts throughout the year and the bigger impediment to his playmaking was his inability to create openings through the dribble. With an improved handle, he can open up holes with one or two dribbles—shifting defenders around to make the passes easier.
2016-2017 Outlook:
Barring a big change during preseason workouts, Johnson will be the starting two for the Crimson when they take the court in the fall. He is arguably the best shooter on the roster and certainly the best high-volume marksman that the team has. Simply having him on the floor will make life much easier on Chambers as the latter returns from injury. Chambers struggled to find space to drive in the lane as a junior and Johnson will be a big help in that regard.
However, the biggest determinant of Johnson's minutes will be his versatility. Given the amount of guard talent at Amaker's disposal, there is a lot of potential for three-guard lineups. Johnson is the biggest of these guards and the most natural fit at the three, but he has to show the ability to defend bigger wings for Amaker to trust him there. Likewise, Johnson's improvement as a playmaker will determine how much he can play as a potential lead guard. Both Chambers and fellow sophomore Tommy McCarthy are effective off-ball creators and will become even more effective if Johnson becomes a better scoring threat off the dribble.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Crimson prepares to take on Stanford in its season opener, David Freed recaps the last season for each of the players on this year’s team and discusses the important season goals for each student-athlete. In this article, he discusses the recent progression and the relevant next steps for sophomore center Balsa Dragovic.
2015-2016 Recap:
As a freshman, Dragovic's minutes were few and far between. He and classmate Weisner Perez struggled to crack a deep frontcourt rotation for the majority of the season, getting spot time in blowouts and few other chances to shine. Dragovic cleared 10 minutes just once all season, getting 13 minutes against Howard in a game where starters Agunwa Okolie and Zena Edosomwan sat with foul trouble for most of the contest.
With the exception of Howard—an eight-point Harvard win—the rookie did not see any action in games that Harvard won by fewer than 16 points. In Ivy League play, with the stakes raised, he saw just 17 minutes in 14 games. He had just four shots across the 17 minutes, registering totals of five points and three rebounds across conference play.
When he played, the rookie showed promise but a lack of polish. While he flashed some range in limited time, making two triples when other teams left him wide open, he didn't demonstrate much of a post game. On defense, his size (at 6'10", he was the tallest player on the team) was a help and a hindrance; while his length made up for some of his tactical mistakes, it also made it hard for him to keep up with quicker opposing ball handlers.
Important Next Steps:
Given the surfeit of frontcourt talent arriving in Cambridge next fall, Dragovic may eventually become a casualty of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker's recruiting prowess. To avoid that, he should focus on maximizing his strength in the middle:
1.Get Stronger — For many freshman and sophomore big men, the most important step is the simplest: getting their bodies ready for the college game. Dragovic is not yet ready to bang with the best big men in the conference and to improve as a post defender, the first step is bulking up while retaining his lateral quickness.
2.Become Automatic From 15 Feet — Dragovic profiles as more of a five than a four, which in Amaker's offense means a steady diet of post-ups and touches near the basket. Unfortunately, that's not his game; compounding the issue, freshmen Robert Baker and Chris Lewis excel at this. Dragovic thus should try to maximize his comparative advantage and develop into a pick-and-pop force who can anchor the paint on the other end (think Channing Frye).
3.Develop Interior Passing Skills — To become an effective complement to a traditional post bruiser like Lewis or senior Zena Edosomwan, Dragovic should stress developing his interior passing game. Evan Cummins ’16 made this sacrifice in 2015-2016, stepping out to the free throw line to give Edosomwan more space to operate. Without a workable jump shot, Cummins created space by fitting passes in narrow windows, something Dragovic can aspire to do as well.
2016-2017 Outlook:
It's not immediately clear how Dragovic fits into the Crimson's plans moving forward. He is an awkward fit next to Edosomwan, which almost definitely rules him out of a starting role next year. He doesn't have the same athleticism as Baker or Lewis and it's tough to see him developing into an explosive pick-and-roll threat. Defensively, he has the length to bother opponents and help the Crimson protect the glass but learning Amaker's system takes time and reps that he might not be able to get.
His shooting may be his saving grace. If he gets stronger, he should be able to hold his own on the offensive glass, but since the incoming freshmen are more traditional back-to-the-basket players, developing those skills will only make his contributions redundant. If he instead can provide spacing with his shooting, he will not only open up the interior for post-ups for his frontcourt partner, but also point guards Tommy McCarthy and Bryce Aiken.
Realizing this vision next season will be difficult. Dragovic will compete with junior Chris Egi and Lewis to be the primary backup to Edosomwan but faces a steep upward climb to playing time. Barring injury, Edosomwan will be the starter in every game next season playing 30-33 minutes a contest. Whatever is leftover will be fought over by six or seven players; if Dragovic can grab a healthy fraction of those minutes, it should be considered a success.

Schuyler Bailar ’19 slices through the water with practiced grace. Halfway down the pool, he breaks the surface in a smooth breaststroke, shoots to the end of the lane, and then stops.
“Did you get it?” Bailar calls over to the photographer perched at the edge of the pool. She clicks through the rapid-shutter images of Bailar on her DSLR: below the blue surface, nearly meeting it, just breaking, arms drawn back before the explosive first stroke, diving under again. Bailar wants her to capture the transitional moment just before his body breaks the pool’s surface tension, when he says a bubble of water will form over his head like a transparent helmet.
This is at least their sixth attempt. So far, no bubble.
“Let’s try one more,” the photographer suggests.
For Bailar, this is just the most recent session in a long string of photoshoots and interviews. If he seems practiced, it’s because he’s used to this—both being in the water, which has always been a place of peace for him, and being in the spotlight, which hasn’t always been so comfortable.
Bailar is the first openly transgender athlete in any Division I NCAA sport. He’s struggled with body image, eating disorders, and dysphoria, but today, showing off in the pool, all of that seems distant. It’s not: If Bailar is confident and comfortable in front of a camera today, it’s because he’s worked hard to get to that point, and because of the impact he believes his attitude will have on others. 
“I’ve spent so much time learning to love my body and learning to be confident in my body, and learning to carry myself with self-love and self-confidence,” Bailar says.“I’m vulnerable in front of the camera because I want to show people that you can be. You can be proud of your body even if you had an eating disorder, even if you’re trans, even if all these things.”
Sydney C. Altschuler, a Lesley University student working on a fine arts thesis, is the photographer crouched beside Bailar today at Blodgett Pool. Altschuler’s project focuses on individuals who have changed her thinking in college, and Bailar is the first transgender person she has ever met.
In many ways, transgender people are more visible now than ever before, both at Harvard and nationally. In Massachusetts, an anti-discrimination bill branded “Trans Bill MA” passed into law in July 2016. Bailar had served as part of a Transgender Visibility Panel to advocate for the bill, which protects the rights of transgender people in public spaces including restrooms and locker rooms, before the Massachusetts state senate. 
Bailar has become a kind of public figure, and moments of private reflection are something he covets. He journals extensively, sometimes writing poetry and stories. He can’t walk anywhere without noticing beautiful things: the orange leaves on a tree he walks by every day, or a tumble of dark clouds over the Charles. He says he’s fascinated with things that change. Capturing these moments in between—the first lightening of the sky at dawn, leaves on the cusp of falling—is an obsession. His phone is full of pictures of colorful skies and sparkling water, as are the walls in his bedroom. On the plane trip back from a conference last week, he snapped pictures of the reddening sky over the wing for an hour straight. 
These days, Bailar must practice a delicate balancing act. His status as a role model for younger transgender and queer athletes and students has prompted him to constantly negotiate a balance between public and private, deciding just how much of himself to share.
It’s hard to say exactly when Bailar started swimming.
He remembers getting into the pool as a toddler, but Gregor S. Bailar, Schuyler’s father, says Bailar swam with his mother before he could walk (“Paddling along like a little penguin,” the elder Bailar describes with a laugh).
Before long, the pool became both a haven and an obsession, a place to work out emotions while protecting himself from the world outside.
Years of early mornings, long practices, and intense swim meets culminated in a standout high school career: Bailar, then swimming for his school’s women’s team, set 10 team records. He also helped to set a national age group record as part of a four-person Nation’s Capital Swim Club team that included future Olympic gold medalist Katie Ledecky.
Bailar grew up in Virginia and attended Georgetown Day School from kindergarten through 12th grade. His best friend from high school, Emma R. Murdock, describes the school as a liberal, accepting environment—albeit one in which “there really wasn’t a trans conversation happening.” 
Early pictures of a young Bailar depict a smiling, short-haired kid in cargo short and baggy shirts, a style close to (if “less fashionable” than, he points out) his current one. Those pictures, says Bailar, represent some of his happiest childhood years—when he dressed towards the gender identity he felt even as it remained unnamed. Still, Bailar often felt anxious: He avoided unfamiliar situations in which he would feel obligated to identify his gender, or defend his use of a women’s restroom.
“Everybody perceived me initially as male, but at the same time there was this… thing of like, ‘but I have to tell,’” Bailar says. “It was really uncomfortable for me, because I knew everyone would perceive me as male first—which was what I wanted… but I also felt like I had to tell them that I wasn’t a boy.”
Bailar was recruited to Harvard’s women’s swimming team in the spring of 2013, and accepted the spot. After graduating, though, he decided to defer his enrollment at Harvard. He had struggled with eating disorders and other mental health issues for years, and it was time to address them.
In June 2014, Bailar entered treatment in Florida for his eating disorders, temporarily setting aside his swimming career. Though the treatment was initially meant to address issues unrelated to Bailar’s gender identity, a therapist encouraged Bailar to consider the possibility that his complicated relationship with gender might be a factor.
That year, Bailar met a transgender man at a gender identity workshop, and something clicked. The encounter gave him the vocabulary to articulate what he had always felt. That day, when Gregor Bailar picked him up from the workshop, Bailar tearfully told him that he thought he was transgender.
“I could see in his eyes he was worried about a lot of things,” Gregor Bailar says, recounting the moment.  “So we just stood there, and I said ‘I love you,’ and we cried, and we just stood there. I think it was even a rainy day,” he adds with a laugh.
“It was a very melancholy moment, but at the same time, a very happy moment,” Gregor Bailar says.  “If you’ve ever had a person you know in that deep self-questioning or troubled state...all you want is for them to come through that with a better sense of who they are, and a better outlook on life, and an ability to be hopeful.”
Schuyler Bailar began asking others to refer to him using male pronouns, and discussed his gender identity with a widening circle of friends and family. In the fall of 2014, he met Murdock in New York, where they made an appointment for Bailar to cut off his long hair.
As he moved out of treatment, Bailar considered exactly what being transgender meant to him, and how he would reconcile these new truths about himself with his swimming career at Harvard. In November, 10 months before he would arrive at Harvard, he informed women’s swim team coach Stephanie Morawski that he was planning to undergo top surgery, removing his breasts and mammary glands, but still planned to swim for the women’s team. That arrangement would have meant navigating a difficult balance between his life in and outside of the pool.
But after Morawski consulted with men’s swim team coach Kevin Tyrell, the game changed. In February, Harvard gave Bailar the opportunity to join the men’s team when he arrived at campus in the fall. After some consideration, Bailar accepted. He had always thought that he would have to decide between swimming and being fully himself, but that was no longer true. In March 2015, Bailar got top surgery. 
It was a difficult move to explain to his high school coaches. On the men’s team, the fiercely competitive Bailar would no longer be setting speed records. “I think it was hard for me to say why I would give up being such a good female athlete for something so ethereal as happiness,” he says.
But the decision was personally liberating. It allowed Bailar to swim “authentically,” as Gregor Bailar puts it, even if that did come at the cost of speed records and first place medals in the pool. Bailar describes the decision to swim with the men’s team as one that saved his life; “the best decision I’ve ever made.”
Choosing to swim for the men’s team meant Bailar could be himself at all times. It also meant he could undergo testosterone treatment, something which wouldn’t have been possible had he stayed on the women’s team (NCAA bylaws dictate that if Bailar remained on the women’s team while undergoing testosterone treatment, the team would have been designated “mixed” and prohibited from competing in the women’s NCAA championship).
It would also inevitably bring Bailar into the public eye, a role he took seriously.
“I told myself and my dad and even the coach, if I do this, if I choose the men’s team, I will be as open as possible about it,” Bailar says.  “I didn’t mean I was going to go screaming to every media source, ‘This is who I am.’ But if it came to that, I would.
“I wanted people to know that it happened, and I knew that it was going to be a different journey,” Bailar continues. “If I was going to do it, I wanted to make sure other people could do it, too.”
Inked onto the left side of Bailar’s rib cage, just below the long pink scar from his top surgery, is a sentence of tattooed Korean. The sentence, which Bailar roughly translates as “take care of your parents,” is one of several deeply personal tattoos which Bailar has acquired since graduating high school.
Like the other marks on his body, the tattoo tells a story. Bailar had already come out to family and friends over the course of his gap year. By May 2015, he was out on Facebook, and starting down the path towards a wider audience and advocacy role. The world was meeting him as he was.
With one notable exception: Bailar still kept his newfound gender identity from his conservative, Korean grandmother, who Bailar and his mother “were pretty sure was going to disown [him].”
“I literally told everyone in the world, and I blocked her on Facebook, and I told everyone who knew her not to tell her,” Bailar says. As someone who tended to put family first, Bailar agonized over the thought of coming out to his grandmother, who “showed no inkling of acceptance.”
Still, for Bailar, keeping his identity a secret from someone so important in his life wasn’t an option. Of all the times Bailar would come out and come out again in his life, this was the one he had worried about the longest, and the most.
Finally, Bailar and his mother gave Bailar’s grandmother a letter explaining his gender identity. Her reaction surprised them both.
“First, she said, ‘I knew that.’ The second thing she said was, ‘OK, now I have two grandsons from your mother.’ And my mom burst into tears because we were so relieved,” Bailar says. After the initial acceptance, Bailar’s grandmother extracted a promise: Bailar could “be a son, a husband, a brother, a man,” she said, but Korean culture dictated that daughters take care of their parents. Bailar’s mother had taken care of Bailar’s grandmother, and Schuyler would have to do the same for his own mother—son or not.
“I was like, ‘Dude, I got you! I got you,’” Bailar laughs. “The point is kind of like, don’t forget where you come from.” The tattoo on his torso is in his grandmother’s handwriting.
It was a pivotal moment for Bailar. “I was so relieved. I had built up almost my entire life that my grandmother was never going to accept me for who I was,” he says. Instead, the moment became a reminder of the strength of the love in his family, and an affirmation of his decision to be direct with the important people in his life. 
For Bailar, telling stories like this one isn’t just personally gratifying. It’s also an important part of the more public role he’s come to fill over the past couple of years. Bailar hopes that talking about his tattoo and the unexpected peace he found with his grandmother can serve as encouragement for other young people afraid to come out to conservative relatives—“it shows that it’s not impossible” for transgender and queer children to reconcile with adults who may seem intolerant.
Sharing messages like this one are part of what motivates Bailar. When he decided to swim for the men’s team at Harvard, Bailar and his family knew that he’d attract attention, at least in the swimming world. But they’d had no idea that his decision would bring so much publicity. In the weeks following Bailar’s decision, media outlets began to pick up his story, and soon interview requests were pouring in. Gregor Bailar stepped into the role of unofficial agent, fielding near-daily requests and seeking out resources for parents of transgender kids.
After participating in a few smaller stories, Bailar and his family decided to accept just a couple of requests: Bailar appeared on “60 Minutes,” and, later in his freshmen year, “Ellen.” After the episodes aired,  Bailar began fielding dozens of emails from people he had never met, a “huge influx” that he found “jarring.”
It was also scary, Bailar says—not all of the responses were positive. But Bailar saw the attention as an opportunity to raise awareness of issues affecting transgender people, and a chance to serve as a role model for queer youth.
The media attention had an impact on his day-to-day life, as well. While the only people watching “60 Minutes” were his swim teammates and the grandparents of his friends, Bailar jokes, “Ellen” had a broad impact at Harvard—now, everyone seemed to know his story.
“There was kind of just a dropping feeling of, ‘Oh, people know who I am,’” Bailar says.
Bailar sees his public position as one informed by his complicated personal journey. In high school, Bailar realized he was attracted to women and came out as a lesbian; now he identifies as a straight man. Growing up, especially in high school, Bailar was socialized as female, though that designation never aligned with his conception of himself. In addition, he says that his Korean-American identity adds yet another dimension to his understanding of the world.  As a result, he’s been perceived in variety of ways, and says he can empathize with a number of identities other than his own. It’s one of the things he values most about the difficult journey that brought him here.
“Not a lot of people have lived as two genders,” Bailar says. “And while I never identified as a woman, I was definitely treated as one.”
But that empathy can bring challenges. In Bailar’s first weeks and months after openly transitioning, he was at times overwhelmed by navigating spaces and behaviors he had previously been excluded from.
“My whole world had changed. Everything was different, and I had to relearn a lot of how my brain worked, and how I worked,” Bailar says. “And then I got surgery, so my body was different, I was wearing a different suit and everything was just different.” Swimming, which had always had a comforting sameness, felt frighteningly unfamiliar. For a while, Bailar considered leaving the team.
In skate parks and locker rooms and on the street, Bailar was suddenly privy to new behaviors and language. Comments about women’s bodies felt particularly “abrasive.”  Once, other men had objectified him and criticized his body. Now, he was hearing friends talk that way about women, with the difficult knowledge that just months before, their words could have been directed at him.
Ultimately, Bailar adopted his own personal strategy for dealing with misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, and the other forms of discrimination that he had encountered and continued to encounter in each new phase of his life. He says he came to recognize that the derogatory language he encountered was a symptom of wider societal problems, and something that he wanted to address rather than shying away from.
“You’re not going to make a difference by leaving, you’re going to make a difference by staying,” Bailar reasons. Instead of leaving situations which made him uncomfortable, Bailar hoped to build personal relationships and change minds that way.
Bailar has built an extensive online presence, documenting his transition and espousing body positivity on Instagram, Tumblr, and a variety of other platforms. The videos, images, and words published on these sites are deeply personal and intimate, tracking the moments and milestones of Bailar’s transition in detail.
Across those platforms, Bailar receives a plethora of comments and requests—so many that he can’t read them all, let alone respond.
“It’s humbling, but it’s also kind of weird, because… there’s just no way I can know that many people,” Bailar says. “I’m very built around relationships and knowing people, and I really value personal connection. People tracked my life very intimately for the last two years, and I know zero about them.”
It’s Wednesday morning. Bailar sits in the back of an Uber on the way to the airport, headed to Indianapolis for an NCAA diversity conference. He’s been up since long before sunrise in order to squeeze in a workout at the pool before the trip. He’ll have to miss class for the next couple of days, but he’s used to this kind of disruption; conferences, speeches, and school visits are now a regular part of being Schuyler. Later, he confesses that he wasn’t completely sure what the topic of this week’s event was until he was sitting on the plane (it turned out to be the intersection of religion and BGLTQ inclusion in athletics, which he found eye-opening).
A year out from the media storm of Bailar’s freshman year, things have cooled down a bit. Between his social media presence, advocacy, and near-constant press requests, though, Bailar’s time is stretched thin. For a self-described introvert, it’s a lot of time spent interacting with the world, and talking about the complicated process of understanding and verbalizing his own identity. The scrutiny can be intense.
These days, deciding which media opportunities to accept and which to decline is a matter of choosing battles. Bailar’s parents like to remind him of a piece of advice he once received from “Grey’s Anatomy” star Ellen Pompeo (who he met on the set of “Ellen”), who frequently receives heartfelt requests for attention and help from fans: You can’t save everyone.
Bailar prioritizes opportunities for advocacy that he believes are going to “make a difference”:  speaking at schools, and reaching out to students struggling with their own gender identities. Bailar hopes that by talking directly with students—sometimes, being painfully open about his own struggles—can provide the next generation with transgender role models and opportunities for self-examination which he lacked growing up. 
“When he was going through his most challenging times, there really just wasn’t any—he calls it vocabulary, around trans issues, trans people,” Gregor Bailar says. “There just weren’t any examples that were out there that were real in his world.” As a result, today Bailar and his father  make an effort to choose advocacy opportunities which will allow Bailar to serve as the kind of transgender role model he never had.
In September 2016, Bailar delivered a speech as part of the newly inaugurated diversity and inclusion board of USA Swimming, the governing body for club swimming (generally the track taken by swimmers who end up at the Olympics).
“It meant a lot to me, because I always thought swimming was going to be the thing that held me back from really expressing myself. That’s one of the reasons that transitioning or coming out has always been really hard for me,” Bailar says. “I always thought swimming was going to be the place where I had to hide things.” The fact that Bailar could talk about his identity to the top administrators in the swimming world, he says, was a “testament to how much the world is changing.”
Bailar has used the media attention focused on his story to become a role model for transgender youth. But that attention isn’t without serious drawbacks.
In our first meeting, he showed me a typical Instagram of himself: flexing for the camera in his swimsuit. “No one wants to write a story about him,” he says. Instead, stories and accompanying images tend to dwell on the years Bailar spent in high school, a time in which he felt pressure to present himself in a more feminine manner.
That focus, Bailar says, tends to reduce his story, and transgender narratives generally, to a moment of dramatic physical transition. In fact, as Bailar and his father both like to emphasize, the many different ways of being transgender are all more complicated than that, involving a complex combination of factors that go far beyond physical changes.
At Harvard, Bailar has found solace in spaces and identities where he can exist without explanation.
“I don’t have many spaces in the world where people don’t know my entire history, and I like to be taken for who I am in a moment in that day, sometimes,” Bailar says. “That doesn’t happen too often right now in my world, because everyone knows my story.”
On Monday and Wednesday, he descends into the basement of William James Hall for work in Irene Pepperberg’s avian cognition lab, where he works with African grey parrots. (At our second meeting, Bailar proudly shows me a picture of himself with a massive bird perched on each arm. “They’re dope. They’re fun. They’re also really annoying sometimes.”)
“I’ve made a point of not bringing all my outside ‘blah blah blah’ into the lab, because it’s kind of like a little haven,” he says. His boss at the lab, says Bailar, “just knows me as this kid, and I kind of like just being this kid.”
It’s Sunday, and we’re back at the pool. Bailar sits on a diving block, curled around himself. He looks out over the pool. One wall is dominated by the names and times of top swimmers—had he joined the women’s team, his name might have been there. But there’s a different kind of victory in this.
“He’s said a million times that it’s its own glory and it’s a huge reward to be swimming as his true self,” Murdock says. “Maybe [it’s] not the track he thought he would be on in high school, but it’s definitely a more true place that he’s standing in.”
These days, Bailar focuses on shifted goals. In the pool, he slowly moves up the ranks, setting his sights on individual swimmers and picking them off one by one.
The future holds uncertainty, but also possibility. Bailar could imagine delivering a TED talk, or writing a book, someday. He’s considering forming a group for out and closeted trans students at Harvard to come together and learn from one another.
Like Pepperberg’s lab or the banks of the Charles River, the pool is a place where Bailar can reflect but also escape from himself. Even on his recent overnight trip to the conference in Indianapolis, he found time to swim twice—partially to stay fit, but also, he says, because he needed a respite from the rest of the world. Water brings with it a different kind of physics, he says, a special gravity that transforms heaviness into speed. It is transparent, yet shielding: Underwater, Bailar is safe from the rest of the world, from all sound, from his own eyes.
“I think out of the water, it’s very easy to reflect on your body and and think about your body. I’m constantly seeing parts of my body, right, but underwater, you just see. You just see the water."
“It’s kind of selfless in that moment, as in, you don’t have a body, almost,” Bailar says. “I always feel like I can think about the most things underwater, almost like dreaming.”
After all those years, it’s still here in the midst of the intensity of swimming that he finds the most calm. The pool is a place where he can be everything at once: self-reflective and complicated, but also singularly focused on excellence.
Sitting beside the arena of some of his greatest battles, Bailar grabs his phone to find a poem he wrote over the summer about swimming. He starts to read.
“Underwater I am just me, like I’ve always been.”

On Sept. 9, 1919, Boston police officers voted 1,134 to two in favor of striking. Among their demands were the right to form a union, higher wages, and better working conditions. But with only 24 policemen left on the force, Boston was in trouble—and Harvard stepped in to help.
According to articles from The Crimson’s archives, more than 250 students volunteered as strikebreakers, and along with an additional 150 faculty members and alumni, the Harvard student body, for a few days at least, became the new face of the Boston Police Department.
The fall semester had not yet started, but in response to the crisis, University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, encouraged students to volunteer as replacement officers. He urged, in his words, “all students who can do so to prepare themselves for such service as the Governor of the Commonwealth may call upon them to render.” Several hundred students who were on campus for summer school, as well as athletes training for the coming season, heard this call to action.
Students were not the only members of the Harvard community to join the force. Rumford Professor of Physics Edwin H. Hall was the first to volunteer. Godfrey Lowell Cabot, Class of 1882, showed up cloaked in a naval cape with a set of pistols on his belt.
They were joined by an unusual cast of temps. According to one rumor, an Oklahoma rancher patrolled the streets in high-heeled boots and a sombrero. The Los Angeles Times profiled Helen Coran, the sole woman to volunteer; she directed traffic in long white gloves and a feather boa after no male replacements could be found to relieve an exhausted volunteer.
Most strikebreakers were upper class, hailing from Back Bay and Beacon Hill, as well as Harvard Square, displacing the poorer Boston Irish that dominated the pre-strike force. This demographic shift towards Protestant Yankees would persist after the strike, as no picketing workers were hired back onto the force.
However, the new officers, said to have lacked “radical sympathies,” were not as well-trained as the old policemen. One theory for the 1920 arrest and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, the anarchists who were accused of two South Braintree murders under shadowy evidence, was that the Boston Police Department was functioning poorly one year after the strike.
This shift in the police force created resentment in Boston’s working class towards the scabs—especially Harvard students—and the political class that they represented. Lowell responded by saying that the students were “reporting simply as citizens of the Commonwealth in response to a call from the governor,” not as strikebreakers.
***
There was a strong national backlash to the strike. At the height of the Red Scare, many Americans were fearful of the labor movement, particularly of public unions. Commissioner Edward Upton Curtis refused to recognize the overwhelming police vote to join the American Federation of Labor, arguing that this was a step towards Bolshevism. Then Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge took a hardline stance towards the strike, which vaulted him into national prominence and a path towards the presidency.
Many Harvard students echoed Coolidge’s stance towards the strike. One anonymous Crimson op-ed supported Curtis, warning that “the United States will soon become a nation controlled by labor unions instead of by an independent electorate.” Another echoed that the strike was “a direct challenge by the labor agitators to the supremacy of the state.”
One young tutor took the opposite position, to the chagrin of many. Harold J. Laski, a socialist theorist, argued in favor of the strike, telling the wives of striking officers that “labor will never yield.” This led to a debate over the limits of academic freedom throughout the University, including within the Board of Overseers. President Lowell eventually stepped in with a threat: “If the Overseers ask for Laski’s resignation they will get mine.”
Even after Lowell’s defense, many were angered by Laski’s socialist sensibility. D. H. Worrall, Class of 1920, wrote that the student body should “shun [Laski] as a ‘Boudoir Bolshevist,’ a breed against which we have been warned.” The Harvard Lampoon–a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine–published an entire issue, the “Laski Lampoon,” dedicated to criticizing him as “a Bolshevik who drags the name of Harvard through the slime.”
All of this eventually drove Laski to move to the London School of Economics the next year. However, just before he left, Laski responded to the Lampoon, characterizing its humor as “a little obvious, and the number of themes upon which it lays unholy hands could have been varied with advantage.”

Most children sleep with plush toys or teddy bears clutched in their tiny fingers. But my sense of security has always come from the books tucked under my pillow. Authors weave tales that stroke my hair and blanket my body, leaving me warmer than any fleece throw could manage. Books do not care if my pajamas match, or if my hair is sticking out at odd angles; they are always willing to sleep over.
As far back as I can remember, I have needed to read before I could fall asleep. Judy Bloom and I used to stay up into the wee hours of the night, sharing secrets in the dim glow of my floral bedside lamp. I would fall asleep wrapped in the warm embrace of easily solved adolescent problems as I dove into a dreamworld.
My parents were equal parts dismayed and delighted by the light they saw seeping beneath my door frame well past my bedtime. They viewed it as a harmless hobby, but I considered it a mandatory ritual, the absence of which would lead to terrifyingly realistic nightmares of Cruella DeVil stealing my toddler siblings, Dracula from “Scooby-Doo” hovering over me as I slept, or an intruder breaking into my home. I often begged my parents to buy a security system, but they insisted that the locks on the house were sufficient.
As I outgrew Judy Bloom paperbacks and transitioned into young adult novels, I watched as my peers devoured books about a young wizard with dead parents—pursued by a powerful, evil force—and I took a hard pass. I did not need to worry about Harry’s safety in addition to my own, so I stuck with the novels that my friends referred to as cupcake books. They had flirty pink covers with loopy lettering and contained innocent love stories. These books kept an awkward prepubescent middle-schooler in the dark about the worst of the world, and I slept soundly under their protection.
In high school, Sarah Dessen was my plus one of choice. Her predictable plotlines, relatable qualms, and touch of humor lulled me to sleep, washing away the stress of performing in school, on the track, or at my job. With Sarah, I was just another girl in search of a boy who could love her like no one has ever been loved before; after 250 pages, I believed that happy endings were real and could certainly be mine.
Now that I’m in college, I am once again the little girl in the Strawberry Shortcake pajamas who throws sleepovers for her favorite authors, reading much too late into the night and dragging herself away to get a wink of sleep. But now my companions are much more mature. I spent two weeks in bed with Amy Poehler; she used colorful language to describe personal tidbits. Tina Fey once kept me up the whole night telling me about her career, her family, and her “Bossypants” approach to life. I didn’t regreat any of it, even when I drooled on myself in section the next day. Ellen DeGeneres made me audibly cackle over winter break, to the point that I had to make her a daytime companion because I did not want to wake my family. I have begun collecting books by badass women; more potential sleepover pals (including Amy Schumer, Hannah Hart, and Jessica Bennett) wait on the edge of my bed for their chance to spend the night.
Upon entering college, you must learn how frequently to wash your sheets, and you must decide with whom you’d like to share them. I have found that the best sleepovers happen when you invite brilliantly funny, positive women to cuddle you in the warmth of their wit and meticulous turns of phrase. I am still just as scared of the dark as my five-year-old self, but nothing can hurt me if I don’t sleep alone.

Joanne B. Chang ’91 estimates that she eats an entire loaf of banana bread every day. At each of the five Flour Bakery + Cafe locations in the Boston area, the staff in charge of trimming banana bread loaves in the morning know to save the cut-off ends for Chang. As she travels to each Flour location throughout the course of her day, Chang snacks on these leftovers. This is just one of many sweet perks of owning a successful bakery chain.
Chang opened the first Flour in Boston’s South End in September of 2000, and its latest installation is right in Harvard Square at 114 Mt. Auburn St. Though grounded in the simplicity of its delicious pastry selection, Flour also serves sandwiches, salads, coffee, tea, soups, and more to its steady flow of customers. The bakery’s colorful and fun decor is a backdrop to people working on laptops, sipping coffees, and chatting at small, circular tables. 
I sit down with an iced coffee on a Saturday afternoon to talk with Chang in Flour’s new Harvard Square location. Only four days after its opening, the whimsically decorated cafe is so busy I need to lean in close to hear Chang’s story—an unexpected one for someone in her field of work.
Chang graduated from Harvard in 1991 with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. Upon graduation, she pursued a path popular with Harvard students both then and now: consulting. After spending two years at a management consulting firm called Monitor Group, Chang decided it was time to move on. 
“Everybody was applying to business school,” Chang says. “I didn’t want to go to business school.” She had a feeling she should be doing something completely different. Thinking back to the days when she used to bake chocolate chip cookies for the Leverett House Grill, Chang wondered if she should try a restaurant job.
After Chang saved up enough money working for Monitor, she had the freedom to try a less lucrative field. She remembers thinking: “Now I’m making more money than I should at 23 years old, but [this job is] still not enough to make me feel satisfied.”
So Chang went with her gut. Leaving behind the world of consulting, Chang entered her first restaurant job at Biba restaurant in Back Bay at a salary of $7 per hour, a steep decrease from her salary at Monitor. Still, something clicked. “I fell in love with being in the kitchen,” she says.
Chang never quite left. She filled many roles in various restaurants and bakeries and had a brief stint in New York, before deciding it was time to own her own place back in Boston. 
Now, Flour’s impressive expansion speaks to its success, but when Chang was first starting out, she remembers her peers’ skepticism. At her five-year Harvard reunion, Chang recalls being asked a question to the effect of “What’s it like to not have a real job?” after mentioning she had gone into the restaurant business. “This is a real job!” Chang exclaims, laughing.
Since that reunion, Chang has stepped even further into the very real world of restaurants. Her job title may be “Pastry Chef/Owner,” but Chang has also written three cookbooks, opened a Chinese restaurant with her husband, taught pastry classes, been featured in countless renowned cooking magazines, and won a James Beard Award for outstanding baking in 2016.
Though she has found her passion in cooking, Chang still nods to her consulting background as an important starting point. “Consulting is looking at a problem and trying to break it down into solvable parts,” says Chang. “That’s basically what running a business is.”
Chang also notes that managing a business is addressing all the things an untrained eye might not even recognize as problems.
“From your point of view, [it] probably looks like it’s working out,” Chang tells me, surveying the bakery with watchful eyes. “From my point of view, I see 20 things that are driving me crazy that I have to figure out how to solve.”
Curious, I ask what those problems might be. Chang directs my attention to the line forming by the pastry counter. “The woman with the sequins is in the right place,” Chang says, nodding approvingly. “The woman in the green is in the right place.” Another approving nod. The third customer makes Chang throw up her hands. “Now that guy’s in the wrong place!” This line-formation problem is high on Chang’s list of things to fix. A retail table to direct customers in a loop formation will do the trick, she thinks. 
On the other side of the counter, one of the brand new staff members has just run his hands through his hair. “Now he’s not washing his hands!” Chang exclaims, observing the employee from across the cafe.
She excuses herself, gets up, and ducks behind the counter to tap him on the shoulder. “I just told him to wash his hands,” she says upon return, and I worry I got him in trouble. “Oh no!” Chang assures me. “He’s brand new.”
Despite her experience, Chang says it can still be a challenge when things don’t go quite as planned. She admits she takes everything personally, from a staff member being rude to a customer, to a sandwich coming out cold.
“You’re taking the things you love and presenting them to the world and saying: ‘I hope you love them too!’” says Chang. Challenges aside, though, Chang says she’s constantly inspired by the team at Flour, and that the people she works with are the best part of her job.
When asked about advice for those who don’t know what to do with their lives, Chang is hardly ruffled by the question. As someone who left a secure job on a gut feeling, she clearly has gotten this question a lot.
Her answer about a dream job is instinctive: “It’s what you think about when you don’t have to be thinking.”

In the politicized wasteland of pre-Election Day Cambridge, I found refuge in the Democracy Center. A self-styled “21st century meeting house” on Mt. Auburn St. that hosts off-beat events like metal concerts, the Democracy Center played host to the Pagans and Witches in Greater Boston for a “Spirit to Spirit Psychic Fair” on Oct. 29.
Not one for punctuality, I arrive four hours into the event, which may account for the less-than-stellar attendance. The “fair,” I quickly learn, is not quite a fair. In one large room, seven “readers” sit across from customers, reading palms, flipping tarot cards, and sketching “aura readings.” A given session costs between $25 and $40. The price is a little steep for a student wallet like mine, so I settle into the makeshift waiting room.
A semi-circular nook separated from the main room by glass doors, the waiting room constitutes mostly women dressed in various degrees of Halloween-esque apparel—drapey shawls, fishnet sleeves, lots of orange and black. Most seem to be in their thirties. Two men, a silent one with a mustache and a talkative one with a fancy camera, round out the rest of my pagan companions.
One woman admires her “aura reading,” a printed outline of the human body, in which the psychic has shaded different colors to indicate the “auric signals” she interpreted from parts of the customer’s body. The psychic, apparently, uses these energy readings to divine personality traits and psychological tendencies.
Shelley L. Holloway, founder and leader of the Pagans and Witches in Greater Boston, also does readings, though tonight she mans a display of handmade jewelry at the entrance to the reading room. Holloway started the group just over two years ago. She herself, though, is an old hand at witchcraft—she has been a pagan priestess for almost 30 years since getting her start at a coven in Maine.
With shockingly bright red hair, Holloway is effusive but down-to-earth, and her description of her religion is not so melodramatic as a cynic might expect. She explains pagan rituals as nonchalantly as a rabbi would discuss Friday night prayers. Her passion for witchcraft and “the gods that we work with,” she says, stems from their “sustain[ing]” power.
Working my way around the waiting room, I realize I’m not the only one here to document proceedings. The man with the camera, Josh N. Samson, is a documentary filmmaker from Utah. He’s currently working on a film about witchcraft, and is also a self-identified witch.
It’s actually quite hard to nail down what exactly witchcraft entails. Each person I talk to seems to have a different set of gods and practices. Samson says paganism is more of an umbrella term for any number of religions that worship pre-Abrahamic gods. Other than that, though, there’s a wide discrepancy in beliefs and definitions.
In fact, consensus among the waiting-room crowd is that this flexibility is the most attractive aspect of their religion. The place is practically littered with lapsed Catholics. At one point, Samson says he was brought up in a religion he later rejected. Many, it seems, came to practice witchcraft because it offered a freer, less constricting, spirituality.
“I’ve never heard a pagan proselytize,” Samson says.
As we finish our conversation, two women start to move around furniture and lower the blinds. The crowd of waiting-room visitors swell, which is confusing, because the event is nearly over. A fellow guest explains that these activities are in preparation for a “pagan ritual” the group is hosting once the fair officially closes.
And with that information, I respectfully take my leave.

It’s 9 p.m. on a Wednesday. Students carrying handfuls of condoms, lube, and vibrators file out of Sever Hall as the presentation titled “I Only Use Magnums: How to Find a Condom Size that Actually Fits” comes to an end. This is Sex Week at Harvard.
Organized by members of Sexual Health Education & Advocacy Throughout Harvard (SHEATH) and co-sponsored by the Harvard Queer Students and Allies, Harvard College Women’s Center, and BGLTQ Office of Student Life, Sex Week is a student-driven initiative that strives to empower the Harvard students to explore issues of love, sex, sexuality, gender, gender identity, and relationships. Now in its sixth year, the program includes a series of lectures, panels, and conversations about some of the most stigmatized and controversial topics on campus.
Sex Week began Oct. 30 with the kick-off event “Sex Ed 101,” and ran through Nov. 6, culminating with a discussion titled “Pset and Chill: Hookup Culture at Harvard.” Between “Reclaiming Your Body,” “Busting Sexual Stereotypes,” and “Party in your Pants,” Sex Week strived to cover all the bases—pun intended.  
“Our goal is to stimulate the discussion around sex and sexuality,” Amelia M. Lamp ’19, co-president of SHEATH, says. “We want people to feel like they’re free to talk about the sex that they have, or the sex that they don’t have. The people they sleep with, or the people they don’t sleep with. What they’re attracted to and what they aren’t.”
While growing up in a progressive household within the predominantly Mormon town of Elko, Nev., Lamp experienced a drastic contrast between openness about sex-related issues in her home and the repression of these ideas in her surrounding neighborhood.
“The entire attitude around sex is very much like the ‘Mean Girls’ quote, ‘If you have sex, you’ll get pregnant and die,’” she says. “People have sex all the time, but nobody talks about it, and when you do, it’s to condemn people for having sex. I didn’t fit with that, didn’t jive with that... I spent most of my adolescent years fighting against this constant force.”
When Lamp came to Harvard and heard about Sex Week, she was enthusiastic about getting involved. Alongside SHEATH co-president Lita D. Peña ’19, Lamp has embraced the opportunity to help change campus culture. At the same time, she wishes she could bring Sex Week home to Elko.
“The language that [Sex Week] use[s] around sexuality in the media and the way we portray it in certain movies, I really would love for people in my hometown to see things like that,” Lamp says. “It really does stem from a personal space of just wanting people to feel like they can be accepted as who they are even though there are institutions that tell you that’s not okay.”
Peña had a similar experience growing up, though the contrast between her home life and her neighborhood was not as stark. Living in New York City, she could, and did, openly talk about these issues with friends and family. However, she soon realized that this was atypical.
“Sex and sexuality were always a part of the family dialogue,” Peña says. “When I got to high school and realized people never talked about these things with their parents and were afraid to ask their parents about birth control, I was like ‘What? Oh my goodness. How is this possible?’ I guess I was just shocked that not everyone had this opportunity and was really saddened by that.”
Inspired by their respective backgrounds, Peña and Lamp have worked to provide an outlet at Harvard for students to discuss sex-related topics openly. Some Sex Week attendees say that events made them feel comforable addressing these issues for the first time.“I’ve had certain experiences where, after events, people will come up to me and say, ‘Thank you so much. I’ve never been able to talk about this, because my family really represses these kinds of issues,’” says Peña.
“I think that’s really my favorite part about Sex Week,” Lamp says. “Just being able to help people in their own journey of their own sexuality, or in the way they have sex and the way that they interact with their gender.”

I was skeptical of my task at first: I was to seek out smaller squares within Harvard Square. One Square holds so many tourists as is—is it necessary to create more backgrounds for vacation photographs? Nevertheless, I set out on my trek, in search of three square locations provided by Google Maps.
The first stop on my journey was General MacArthur Square (1), a familiar sight for residents of Straus, Matthews, and Massachusetts Hall or devotees of Liquiteria. Essentially a glorified traffic island, this square hosts a statue, giving it a leg up in the hierarchy of sub-squares. Inexplicably, the statue doesn’t depict General Douglas MacArthur, but rather Charles Sumner, an 1830 Harvard alum and senator famous for being caned by fellow senator Preston Brooks. He’s looking better now.
After the first stop on my journey, I was already perplexed—but I had to forge ahead. Brattle Square (2) was next on my list, abutting Felipe’s and Brattle Square Florist. My search for a “Brattle Square” sign was fruitless, but I did discover a plaque recognizing the brick area as “Joseph A. Deguglielmo Plaza.” The area that I expected to be Brattle Square was dedicated to a former mayor of Cambridge, so I resigned myself to the fact that Brattle Square was more a mindset than a location and pushed onwards.
The last location that Google Maps suggested was Winthrop Square (3), situated near Peet’s Coffee. I wandered around the grassy lawn and sidewalk until I discovered it: a literal square of laid brick tucked between Peet’s Coffee and Parsnip, flanked by two columns helpfully labeling it as “Winthrop Square, 1999.” The square’s only inhabitants were several piles of dead leaves. Standing between the columns, I heard a howling sound that I can only assume was the ghost of John Winthrop, perhaps, his less-successful second cousin for whom the square is named.
Having exhausted my Google Maps-given clues, I was left directionless. But lo and behold—at the corner of Eliot St. and JFK St., I found the inimitable Sue Williamson Square, a street corner marked by a tall black sign. Research later revealed that Williamson was a longtime employee of the Kennedy School—but maybe not important enough for a bona fide park bench.
Still, I was newly energized. If squares could simply be street corners, there were endless squares to be
found. Squares within squares! I continued wandering towards the River Houses, eyes peeled for the telltale black sign.
As I crossed JFK onto Memorial Dr., my heart surged. I had spotted my fifth square outside of the square, memorializing Scott Harshberger, former district attorney. I continued forward with urgency, not just because dusk was swiftly approaching, but because I had realized that spotting squares had become my Pokemon Go. There were so many squares and so little time. I had to catch them all.
At the intersection of Grant St. and Dewolfe St., I found Lt. Col. James C. Brennan Square, and here my linear path ended. In a wild zigzag, I traversed Mt. Auburn St. and Bow St. on my way back to the Yard and discovered four more squares: Bishop John Boles Square, Robert W. Taylor Jr. Square, David L. Halberstam Square, and Louisa Solano Square. A fifth, Ben Olken Square, rested at the corner of Bow St. and Mass Ave.
The final square of my journey is situated in front of The Winn. Quincy Square is home to several well-manicured plots of land and some artistically placed stones, and is dedicated to Josiah Quincy, who apparently wasn’t satisfied with just having a namesake house.
Over the course of my brief excursion, I discovered 12 squares within Harvard Square. Why are there so many? It could be due to the City of Cambridge’s incessant need to memorialize more and more of its famous inhabitants. Will the entire city someday be nothing but squares? If so, I suspect there are more squares out there, waiting to be discovered by the adventurous reader.

The only even remotely Viking feature at Norumbega Tower in Weston, Mass., is the plaque carved out of what appears to be an entire kitchen counter. You could just about pretend that the teenaged couples’ engravings along the tower’s flanks are traces of skirmishes past, and that the roar of the cars through the trees is the rushing of a mighty river—but the illusion doesn’t last long. You might begin to feel bad for being so distinctly un-transported to any Norwegian township. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry. There never was a Norwegian township here.
It was Harvard professor Eben Norton Horsford who commissioned all 40 feet of the tower to be built and wrote the immense plaque commemorating the Viking fort of Norumbega. Never mind that Norumbega didn’t exist, or, if it did, was 1,500 miles from the corner of Weston that he chose as its site. This didn’t stop him from commissioning a statue of Leif Erikson which stands today in the middle of Commonwealth Ave., from installing a six-foot-wide plaque on Memorial Dr. to mark the spot of Leif Erikson’s house, or from publishing several books on the Viking settlements of New England. This was a man on a mission, so much so that the mission’s complete and utter lack of evidence was the tiniest of setbacks. 

Horsford is better known as the co-founder of Rumford Chemical Works. The ubiquitous shiny red containers of baking powder are Horsford’s packaging and his formula. He co-founded Rumford Chemical Works in 1854 after patenting his “double acting” baking powder, a huge hit because—according to Pia Sorensen, the preceptor of the popular class Science and Cooking—baking had hitherto been an expensive and inconvenient process, involving fermented milk or tartaric acid to aid in leavening. Horsford’s stable, portable reformulation was lauded by the American Chemical Society as one of the “seminal achievements in the history of the chemical sciences” in 2006; it made him a fortune.
Not all of Horsford’s worth, though, is so well respected. Stephen Mitchell, Robert S. and Ilse Friend Professor of Scandinavian and Folklore, discusses the “phony science” that catalyzed Horsford’s fanciful ideas. Having grown up near the Seneca tribal region of western New York, Horsford picked up some Iroquoian; as such, he “thought he knew maybe more than he actually knew about native languages.” His first mistake was interpreting Norumbega, an El Dorado-like settlement that appeared in the stories of an English sailor, to be a Native American corruption of Norvegia, the Latin term for Norway. Once Horsford had made up his mind that Norumbega was Norwegian, he fell victim to confirmation bias. Mitchell says, “I get the impression sometimes that he just went out for buggy rides on a Sunday and would see things and go, ‘Ah, must be an ancient fort.’” 
One of Horsford’s disciples, Elizabeth Shepard, published the highlights of his theories in “A Guidebook to Norumbega and Vineland, or The Archaeological Treasures along Charles River.” She describes Norumbega Tower as a “magnificent and graceful monument to his convictions.” Shepard really did her homework, going so far as to provide page after page of maps crowded with contour lines and tiny serifed labels of the imagined fort and surrounding fishery—but even armed with these, it’s impossible to recognize much more than the river junction and Horsford’s commemorative tower in the modern day.
That might be because there’s not a whole lot to see. Upon excavation of the foundations of a house that (he had already decided) was Leif Erikson’s, Horsford uncovered colonial artifacts instead of Viking remnants. No evidence? No problem, with a little imagination. He insisted that Leif Erikson’s ho use was inhabited by colonial settlers many years later, and erased any room for doubt by installing a plaque there: “On this spot in the year 1000, Leif Erikson built his house in Vineland.” The excavation was inconclusive, but his phrasing sure doesn’t sound like it.
Gloria Greis, Director of the Needham Historical Society, views Horsford’s certainty as a vestige from his career as a chemist. In chemistry, “a reaction happens or it doesn’t, something precipitates or doesn’t precipitate, something combines or doesn’t combine.” Where science provides answers, philosophy and history give more questions, and as such, Horsford’s background of scientific rigor did not help him so much as it hindered him. 
Horsford lived during the scientific upheaval caused by the publication of Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of the Species” in 1859 and the social turmoil from the influx of Catholic immigrants in the latter half of the 19th century. The academic community was seeking to redefine the biblical truths it had previously taken for granted, and the Protestant upper class was seeking an American icon besides the Catholic Christopher Columbus. Both parties found what they wanted in the Vikings.
Horsford was relatively progressive, according to Greis: He “saw his wealth as a vehicle for assisting others,” commissioning a public library for Shelter Island in a time when libraries were largely private institutions, donated to Wellesley College even though women’s education was highly controversial, and supporting the suffragette and abolitionist Anne Whitney, the sculptor behind the Leif Erikson statue on Commonwealth Ave. “In all ways, it seems, Horsford is admirable,” Greis says. She pauses. “But then he goes down this strange little path.”
He’s not alone. L’Anse aux Meadows, in Newfoundland, Canada, is these days accepted to be the Vineland that Horsford so wanted to find. Loretta Decker, the Visitor Experience and Product Development Officer for Parks Canada, recalls visitors in full Viking costume paying their respects to L’Anse aux Meadows; once, a woman directed the site’s archaeologist to excavate a certain area in which she claimed to have lived in a previous life. 
Decker herself grew up in L’Anse aux Meadows, immersed in Icelandic sagas. The excavation site was uncovered in her grandfather’s backyard. “We used to go up in the hills above the site and berry pick, and I remember looking out and scanning the horizon for those red and white sails.,” she remembers. “I thought that if the Vikings came back, we’d have to get home quick.”
The strange little path from Harvard to Leif Erikson’s plaque winds its way along Memorial Dr., with the river peeking through lanes of traffic. You might find yourself looking across them for those red and white sails. On the approach to the busy intersection near the Cambridge Boat Club, the plaque is barely visible. Naked on the shoulder of the road, it’s both monumental and pitiful, 1,500 miles from home.

While listening to Salam Fayyad, the former Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, speak in a hotel in Ramallah, I find myself daydreaming. Around me, everyone else scribbles notes, snaps pictures, or listens raptly enough to come up with hard-hitting questions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These seem like natural reactions to the situation—good Harvard students carefully recording this important man’s words in order to document the experience.
I try my best to listen closely, too, as I watch Fayyad pace around the podium. But if you asked me today what, exactly, Fayyad talked to us about, I wouldn’t be able to tell you.
I could tell you instead that, in the film reel of my daydream, Fayyad is cast in the part of a gregarious but world-weary uncle. His movements around our dining room are dynamic: He doesn’t stay behind his podium for longer than a few minutes, instead walking around or in front of it as though it’s an obstacle that prevents him from connecting with the crowd. Depending on whether he is joking or advancing an argument, his facial expressions bounce between a cheeky grin and a polite smile that droops around the corners with wear. His humor sounds quick and casual throughout the address, but the jovial tone he uses starts to seem incongruous if you look too closely at the stooped figure and tired, blank expression behind it.
In my daydream, Fayyad is in his own dining room, holding a rare gathering for his entire extended family. The adults relax in various positions around the table, joking and debating after their large meal, but he stands, commanding the center of attention with the loudest jokes and smartest arguments. Once in a while, he leans on a corner of the table and seems, suddenly, very old.
Back in our dining room in Ramallah, Fayyad comes to a full stop as someone asks a question. He locks eyes with his interlocutor and inclines his whole upper body toward them. The student stutters over his first few words, and Fayyad nods encouragingly to keep him going. He clasps his hands to indicate the full pause in his own speech.
I imagine that, back home with family, Fayyad’s youngest niece catches his attention. She is looking up at him with a strained expression, torn between voicing her excitement and remaining quiet in this adult-dominated space. He stops another conversation short and drops to his knees to lock eyes with the little girl and hear her out as she attempts to explain that she just finished her first day of kindergarten. He looks dignified even in this squat, and I realize he reminds me of my own uncle.
As we leave Ramallah, I carry this image with me. But I also wonder whether I have just squandered this opportunity to hear an important man speak about important issues.
I reason that I am out of practice. After these three years at Harvard, I have not sat through a single event at the JFK Junior Forum in the IOP or gone out of my way to hear any famous visiting speaker on campus. I don’t see the value in these events: Why see or touch or hear an important woman in person instead of reading her ideas on paper or watching her speak on a screen, unless you are counting the satisfaction of telling others that you met a celebrity? The popularity of posting selfies with visiting celebrities convinced me there must be an element of vanity in going to see Toni Morrison speak at the Norton Lectures before—or, worse, instead of—reading Beloved alone and unseen in your dorm room. These in-person encounters seem less about listening and learning to begin with, and more about seeing and being seen.
I also reason that I am tired: We are more than halfway through a 10 day trip around all of Israel, running on an average of four hours of sleep a night and coming straight out of midterm season at Harvard. Daydreams break me out of the overwhelming reality of this present and let me fall back into myself for an hour.
I decide that I can justify tuning out of a talk that could have taken place anywhere—such as Harvard’s campus, where I skip hearing similar speakers on a near-daily basis—because I need the energy to immerse myself in fully experiencing the sights and activities that can’t take place anywhere but Israel.
Looking back now, half a year later, I’m less able to justify my behavior. After daydreaming through Fayyad’s talk I also drifted off into real sleep while listening to a retired Supreme Court Justice in the Jerusalem YMCA, thought about friends back home on the hike up Masada, and tuned out our tour-guide to listen to snippets of conversations happening around me while walking through Jaffa.
I don’t remember all of the historical and political details our leaders explained to us in each of those locations, but I do retain my impressions of each place. In the film reel of my memories, the Jerusalem YMCA is a medieval castle, Masada is a newly colonized hill on Mars, and the old city of Jaffa is a Middle Eastern twist on Old Town Square in Prague. Each is populated by its own set of characters based loosely on my experiences in Israel or brought in from other memories of related places. The YMCA houses an aging queen inspired by the justice we saw there, but her granddaughter is a princess drawn from the Disney movies I saw when I was little. Masada belongs to a colonizing army of men dressed like the Israeli soldiers we saw at its peak, but also to the friends I thought of on my hike. Jaffa to me means honeymooning tourist couples discussing where next to go and my aunt getting us lost back in Prague.
These are mental snapshots—not pictures that can be shared online to prove something about myself to others, but images that help me to understand something about myself, as I exist in the world they captured for me. They do not fit neatly together, and the larger narrative makes sense only to me. I can’t replace them with an image or a text, which would keep a record of these people and places but could not let me live alongside them like I did in Israel.
Now, back at Harvard, I realize that I may know how Toni Morrison makes use of magical realism in Beloved, because I have read her book. But I don’t know what character she may have become in the story I could have daydreamed as I watched her speak in person.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The upcoming vote on whether students at Harvard ought to form a union and become part of the collective bargaining process as employees of the University has undoubtedly generated a lot of excitement and perhaps some anxiety. While a Harvard parent, I consider myself a disinterested party given my lack of affiliation as a student, faculty member, or administrator; however, I do have some thoughts for consideration, in addition to what the pro-union organizations and the Harvard administration have said.
I run a manufacturing company and have witnessed in my 30-year career the relative decline of American manufacturing from its peak employment in 1980 to today, losing roughly eight million jobs while the rest of the economy added over 60 million workers. That’s not to say manufacturing isn’t still important or doesn’t offer rewarding career opportunities (it is and does), but it’s impossible to understand the relative decline of American manufacturing without acknowledging the role that organized labor played in its demise. It may hurt to hear this, but the data—by which I mean the numerous academic studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals—portray an irrefutable truth: The presence of unions destroys jobs and industries over the long run.
It’s not the early 20th century anymore, when unions were needed to help protect workers from the depredations of the industrial workplace. Even Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president who introduced major statutes in the 1930s promoting the rise of the labor movement, thought unions should be limited. Unions, after all, distort the market for labor, and without a specific exemption written into the antitrust laws, collective bargaining would be illegal as a monopolistic restraint of trade. This is why FDR opposed granting organizing rights to public sector workers, and why he would without a doubt have opposed granting union rights to graduate students receiving stipends from their universities.
It’s easy to dismiss these concerns given the differences between graduate students and factory workers. But such a line of thinking would underestimate the capabilities of employers to respond to the market distortions imposed by labor agreements. Union organizers will say that graduate students who organized at other universities have been successful at improving their compensation and working conditions, and that the new unions haven’t caused any negative impacts; the Harvard administration will argue that a union will ruin the special relationship between faculty and graduate students and impede the educational mission. But what really needs to be heard is how unions affect the economics of the workplace, and what employers have been doing, for over one hundred years, to counteract these deleterious effects.
The economic impact of organized labor in the workplace is simple: Unions raise wages and reduce employment. It’s certainly true that unions can shorten your working hours, increase your stipend, improve working conditions, or modify the benefit package; but at the end of the day it can all be quantified as money. These apparent benefits from organized labor raise the cost of employment to the employer. And the only reasons a union can do this—to increase the effective pay you would receive—are its monopolization of the workforce and the threat of a strike. So the employer of a unionized workforce pays higher compensation per worker than would otherwise be the case, which naturally leads to hiring fewer workers. The once-popular assertion that unions increase the productivity of their workers has now been thoroughly discredited. Instead, the result is fewer workers making more money.
From the employer’s perspective, when an important part of your cost structure suddenly goes up in price, your alternative is to look for lower-cost inputs: In this case, other (non-union) workers who can do what graduate students do, but for lower cost. The union may try to prevent the University from outsourcing labor, but the formation of a union will instantly establish a tension—between the employer aiming to outsource labor and the union trying to prevent that—from now until the end of time. It’s not personal, and it cannot be avoided: It’s simply the result of a natural market force. Even the wealthiest universities have budgets to meet.
High taxes on cigarettes caused smoking to decline; high gasoline prices led to less driving and more use of public transportation. Nothing different here. When faced with higher labor costs, employers simply use less of it. The University will find ways to use less graduate student labor: Accepting fewer students into graduate programs; assigning TFs to larger classes or more of them; broadening job duties; or otherwise intensifying the job. This is already happening at other universities where graduate students have unionized.
However it changes the nature of graduate education, a unionized workforce will certainly change its economics. There will be fewer seats at the table for those aspiring to become academics, and the University will spend more money on this shrunken pool of graduate students instead of spending that money on undergraduate scholarships, additional full professorships, and new departmental programs. From where I sit, the first rung on the ladder to a life in the academy still looks pretty good: Free education from the best minds in the world, along with room, board, and a modest cash stipend; and after a few more rungs on the ladder, a good shot at grabbing the brass ring of a tenured position at a major university. All this in exchange for a little bit of teaching.
So to the students voting on Nov. 16 and 17: Go ahead and relish your newfound right to organize. But having a right does not require you to exercise it. If you can learn anything from the history and economics of our manufacturing sector, you’ll tell the UAW “no thanks” and bid them adieu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tension in the room was palpable. The hum of muffled chatter was interrupted sporadically by errant sobs. Disbelief. Despondence. Despair.
Nov. 8, 2016.
I sat in Memorial Hall at Harvard University, watching the historic 2016 election results unfold in a completely unexpected way. Though the vast majority of expert analysis had predicted a victory for Hillary Clinton, outsider Donald Trump was on track to be the next President of the United States. Here I was, at arguably the heart of education in North America, and all around me some of the most qualified students in the world were falling apart.
The rhetoric that Donald Trump has used to campaign with over the past 18 months is insidious, incorrect, and a threat to democracy. He is racist. He is lewd. He is surprising. He is threatening. He is loud. He is bold.
But his election to the top position in the United States government is not as much a reflection on him as it is a clear message from the American people. They are disenfranchised. They are uncertain. They are angry. They are afraid.
At times like these, it is hard to know how to react. I, personally, have never felt such a convoluted array of emotions. I feel, however, that it is important to cling to a cliché: that there is always hope. Even in the darkest of times, hope is a little butterfly that will claw its way back from the abyss to light humanity's path.
Democracy has its ups and downs. Like us, every system made by humans is flawed. But democracy in its truest form was never meant to protect the interests of the few—it was meant to represent the interests of the many. Like it or not, it has done that here in America.
As I said over and over Tuesday night: I have faith in the American people. While the election's results did cause me to reevaluate this notion, that faith remains.
We are about to enter an interesting few months. It is of critical importance that we remember that we have been through tough times before. We have been divided. We have been upset. And we have been afraid. But by holding on to ideals that make us uniquely human—hope, love, kinship, peace and, yes, democracy—we will make it through the coming times.
To those watching in disbelief around the world: I know that the choice the American people have made may seem unbelievable, frightening, and even provoking. But we must remember that, although it doesn't seem this way, the system worked. The will of the people shone through. While that may be concerning, it is symbolic of the underlying strength of the democratic values that run deep in this nation. Of this we should be proud. And if it is of any solace, just as that will can give power, so too can it take it away.
I have sat with the very people Trump has repeatedly attacked. My classmates and closest friends are of different faiths, ethnic and national origins, and sexual orientations. Some are undocumented immigrants.
These people have every reason to be angry and afraid. Angry at those who voted for a leader who threatens their very existence—and afraid for what is to come.
But these people woke up alongside me this morning, got dressed, and went to class. They did this because the desire for knowledge, for understanding, for truth, cannot be repressed. We will continue to learn, continue to question, and continue to work towards a brighter future, because that is what the world needs.
In times of confusion and chaos, we must—and will—continue to seek common ground and learn from our mistakes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square has always had strong community and commercial interests. The vested interests of businesspeople in the future of Harvard Square is evident through the proposals of building remodeling as well as broader renovations. In particular, suggested remodeling, such as that of the building housing the Curious George store, would require a complete redesign of the building's interior and the eviction of its existing tenants, at least for the duration of the expensive remodeling process. Other renovation proposals have included a controversial effort to renovate of the iconic Out of Town News kiosk and the surrounding plaza in an effort to modernize both places.
These proposals have been met with opposition from many in the community, including Harvard professors who spoke out against changing the appearance of the kiosk as well as Cambridge residents who worked to delay the remodeling of the building that would require the eviction of the Curious George store and Urban Outfitters.
The issues brought to the forefront by residents and businesspeople are moderated by the Cambridge City Council. Members of the Council recently passed three resolutions concerning preservation of the Square, inviting both prominent donors and business developers as well as local residents to meet for further discussion of these proposals.
It is encouraging that councillors have extended this invitation to both landowners as well as the broader community. For large-scale renovations such as the ones proposed, it is critical to have public voices included in the discussion, not just that of the business elite. Harvard Square’s rich history has made it a treasured place to all of its residents, and it is important to preserve buildings in the Square that are historically significant.
Needless to say, the Council, as well as those involved in further discussions, should be mindful of the attitudes that the people who live and work in the Square have towards its cultural and historical significance. Contractors, landowners, and City Council members in particular should work to understand the array of opinions regarding changes to buildings that hold so much weight for particular people.
Furthermore, residents’ and developers’ visions for Harvard Square may fundamentally differ from each other. Proposed renovations will likely adversely affect the existing business ecosystem of the Square, driving out small business owners who may no longer be able to afford rent and displacing businesses that have been in the same location for years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When people describe the voice of St. Lenox’s frontman, Andrew Choi, there is very little consensus for an apt comparison: Resemblances have been noted in everyone from Stevie Wonder to Rufus Wainwright. However in the band’s new album, “Ten Hymns From My American Gothic,” Choi’s voice sounds more like that of Chris Stapleton or an American version of Van Morrison. It’s a style of light but gritty singing—with a delivery that sounds like Choi’s forcing out every syllable he sings—that all comes together to reflect his Middle American origins.
Despite how Midwestern much of the album sounds, the focus of “Ten Hymns” is on a somewhat different theme. Choi, the musician/full time lawyer, wrote this album as a birthday present for his Korean immigrant dad’s 70th birthday. The album’s main focus is the immigrant experience, exploring it in a manner somewhat similar to the “Master of None” episode “Parents.” As a whole, “Ten Hymns” functions as a stunning album that explores themes ranging from achieving the american dream to generational differences in privilege between immigrants and their parents.
At its peaks, “Ten Hymns” is a bubbly album with expertly crafted songs like “Fuel America” and “Korea,” combining a second-generation American perspective with the hope and optimism evocative of first-generation immigrants looking for a better life. With lines like “And I’m really gonna make it this year” and “And silk and blue is a cool new look for a hipster dressed up pretty,” Choi conveys a sense of wit and self-deprecation. However, he portrays some truths hidden behind the humor, like the difficult and often near-futile search for success in new places or appropriation of one’s culture.
The instrumentation never overshadows Choi’s voice but instead carries it along with light piano chords and catchy guitar riffs—although the instruments on each song sound widely different from anything that came before. “People from Other Cultures” is one of the finest songs on the album. It stands stark and somber in contrast to the brightness of “Korea,” with a bassline and piano covering much of the background music for “People.” It provides the perfect template for the theme of the song: the disconnect between Choi and his parents, who had vastly different experiences in wartime Korea than he did growing up in the Midwest (“I said it’s different cultures / she’s from a different world”).
This meshing of the instrumentation and the themes of a song is an effect seen for the most part throughout the album. The individual songs do not flow together especially well throughout the album—largely because each song sounds so unique. While this should be a larger flaw of the album, the songs for the most part work astoundingly well as individual pictures of the same narrative.
The album’s only real weak point is the song “The Public School System,” which ironically follows one of the best tracks of the album in “Thurgood Marshall”—a lively song about being inspired by the law that features a great thematic twist at the end. “The Public School System,” on the other hand, is a dull piece that does not fit in thematically or musically with the rest of the album. Choi reminisces about public school education using a series of stories; it opens with the phrase “You’re not better than me, rich kid,” then turns into an unfocused recollection of public school.
Aside from “The Public School System,” “Ten Hymns From My American Gothic” is a stellar album, covering the experience of the children of immigrants from the emotional highs of boundless optimism to cultural disconnect. Its lively, folky feel creates a powerful representation of hope and new identity that makes this album one of the most interesting releases of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David Blight, professor of American History at Yale University, connected Frederick Douglass’s life and work to the 2016 presidential election at Harvard Law School Wednesday.
Blight is working on a book about Douglass, a black writer and prominent abolitionist in the 19th century. Blight said he decided to write the book after encountering new materials, including 10 family scrapbooks, thousands of newspaper clippings, letters, and memoirs, about six years ago in Savannah, GA.
“It opens the last third of Douglass’s life as never before,” he said.
Blight analyzed Douglass’s extended families, two marriages, and his relationships with two European women for his book. He said this focus on Douglass’s personal life differs from previous scholarship on the author.
“[Past scholarship] presented him as out-of-touch, getting old and always in rivalries and fights with other black leaders,” Blight said.
Blight also discussed Douglass in the context of the 2016 presidential election. He said the election of 1864 was one of “the most racist, white supremacist elections in American history.”
“We think we were tense,” he said, referring to the recent election. “[In 1864], everything was on the line for black Americans, for white union troops, for the North, the entire meaning and purpose of all that bloodshed.”
Blight said Douglass turned to writing during this period of political turmoil.
“Douglass is all about words, he’s all about language,” he said. “Words were essentially the only power he ever had, the only weapons he ever had.”
History professor James T. Kloppenberg called Blight’s lecture “riveting.”
“Filling out the rest of his life, especially the last part of his life, will give us insights into Douglass that we’ve never had before,” he said.
Audience member Diane Williams said she appreciated how Blight “humanizes” Douglass and connected his life to the election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some of Harvard’s authorities on American politics, government, and economics shared feelings of shock and warned of instability in the political system after Donald Trump became president-elect, contrary to the predictions of pundits and pollsters.
“From the beginning, I’ve not anticipated Donald Trump in any regard,” government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 said. “ I kept thinking he would come to an end.”
Mansfield, among the minority of outspoken conservative intellectuals at Harvard, said he thought a lack of education among the American electorate contributed to Trump’s unexpected success.
“The whole thing is a victory of the lower half of the American IQ,” said Mansfield, who chose to write in Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate, for president.
Harvard faculty tend to lean liberal in their political views. A Crimson analysis in February showed that 91 percent of contributions to presidential candidates at the time went to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Some of Mansfield’s colleagues expressed concern that the Trump presidency will further divide a nation already polarized after one of the most bitter presidential campaigns in modern history.
“It’s a real disaster for American politics,” Government professor Jennifer L. Hochschild said. “There’s a huge section of the population that was so angry, mistrustful, furious, that they were prepared to take an enormous risk.”
Government and sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol called Trump’s election “a crisis comparable to the Civil War.”
Skocpol, who supported Clinton in the election, said she was nervous about the businessman’s victory because of her own scholarship, some of which has focused on conservatism in America.
“I think that the disorganization and internal conflict of the Republican party have opened the door to someone winning this presidency that even the vast majority of Americans believe is not qualified to be president,” she said. “We’re in for a terrifying period for this country.”
Jill E. Abramson ’76, a senior lecturer in English and the former executive editor of the New York Times, wrote about election night for the Guardian from Hillary Clinton’s New York City headquarters.Abramson said by the time she left, shortly before midnight, signs of distress were evident among the assembled Clinton supporters.
“There were young women who I could see were crying and comforting each other,” she said.
In the wake of Trump’s surprise victory, Abramson said journalists must redouble their efforts to act as political watchdogs and check the new president’s authority.
“I think Trump’s rhetoric has had an obvious authoritarian streak,” she said. “I don’t think the country wants a government with unbridled power.”
Some professors discussed the surprising election result at forums. On Wednesday evening, the Mahindra Humanities Center hosted a panel discussion with government professor Danielle S. Allen, economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, and history professor Jill M. Lepore.
Laibson argued that Trump’s victory was fueled by growing income inequality between educated and uneducated Americans, a problem that he projects will intensify with robots and artificial intelligence increasingly replacing the labor force.
“What I unfortunately see, is a much darker road ahead,” he said “The forces that I’ve described are going to intensify.”
The large lecture hall that held the panel was entirely filled, and people crowded outside the door for a chance to enter. Homi K. Bhabha, a humanities professor and the director of the Mahindra Center, who moderated the panel, said the event was meant to be an occasion for both conversation and comfort.
“I’m so delighted to see a very full room on an evening when I feel particularly empty,” he said.

Jo B. Laird, a lawyer known for her work on art sales, cautioned Harvard Law School students Wednesday that legally defending artistic creation has become more urgent after the 2016 presidential election.
Art law deals with freedom of speech, sales, auction agreements, and consignment issues that apply to a work of art, according to Laird, whom Artnet Magazine named one of the ten most powerful attorneys in the art world. Laird said that art represents the expression of ideas, and she warned that institutions have incentives to control the expression of these ideas or thoughts.
“Institutions and governments will be attracted to art or any type of creative thought that helps spread their own message,” Laird said.
In light of Donald Trump’s recent victory in the presidential election, Laird argued that it is particularly important for the American people to understand that they have an obligation to create art and engage ideas.
“Now with the makeup of the government, that’s what we got to do,” Laird said. “We have to stand up for the explosion of art that encourages people to think outside of the box.”
While Laird acknowledged the fact that job prospects for students studying art law can be sparse, she underscored its importance.
“It is really hard work, but everything you do is going to be hard work,” she said.
Laird ended her talk on an optimistic note, encouraging students to not lose sight of how they can be a part of American democracy after the presidential election.
“Just because you accept the results of the presidential election doesn’t mean you have to accept the policies that come after,” Laird said. “Where you have the right to do it, you should exercise the rights.”
Kate Wiener, a student at the Law School, said she enjoyed hearing Laird speak.
“Laird struck an incredible tone about an interesting subject in a very important moment in history,” Wiener said. “I really appreciated the conversation that Laird led since it was so relevant in the political world.”
Heather Lee, another Law School student, echoed this sentiment.
“It was refreshing that Laird connected what happened in the presidential election to art, and that this connection can be seen throughout the past as well,” she said.

As it crafts a new core curriculum of its own, Princeton is looking at Harvard’s recent efforts to revamp its general education program, which will go into effect fall 2018.
In an Oct. 20 report, Princeton’s Task Force on General Education wrote that it had consulted a series of peer institutions, including Harvard. Some of the task force’s six recommendations, which include introducing optional classes during the month of January, mirror some practices in place at Harvard and other schools.
After a year-long review, a faculty committee found in May 2015 that Harvard’s General Education program was “failing on a variety of fronts.” The Faculty eventually approved a new program that reduced the number of Gen Ed classes and required students to take a number of distribution requirements across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ divisions.
The Princeton report encouraged narrowing the list of existing general education courses and developing new courses that would “explore social problems in collaborative, interdisciplinary ways.”
According to Harvard philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, who chaired the committee that oversaw Harvard’s General Education renewal, Princeton’s current general education structure focuses more heavily on distribution requirements than does Harvard’s.
“The things that sound like they’re a little bit reminiscent of the Gen Ed reform are the giving more freedom to fulfill certain kinds of distribution requirements and giving more focus to the Gen Ed courses themselves,” Kelly said.
Kelly said the Harvard General Education reform committee did not look at Princeton’s current model because of its  focus on distribution requirements, but instead considered schools such as Stanford, Columbia, Chicago, and Yale when crafting a new program.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen said many schools have looked to Harvard for curricular advice more generally.
“When Harvard makes big changes, people ask what’s going on,” she said. “I’ve met with people from pretty much all over the world. A lot of other schools domestically will look to us.”
The Princeton report also referenced Harvard’s joint concentrations to encourage the creation of “formalized joint or mixed concentrations.”
Other recommendations at Princeton include new requirements for all undergraduates to study a foreign language regardless of prior proficiency and the introduction two new mandatory “tags” for classes—international content and the intersections of culture, identity, and power.
The recommendations made by the task force are now being reviewed by Princeton administrators.

Three Harvard professors sat down to talk politics, economics, and demographics in the aftermath of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election at a Mahindra Humanities Center-sponsored panel Wednesday night.
The panel, titled, “Dark and Stormy: Reflections on the Election,” which took place Wednesday night, filled seats with attendees from across Cambridge.
Mahindra Center Director Homi K. Bhabha facilitated the panel, which also featured history professor Jill Lepore, economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, and Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics Director Danielle S. Allen.
Lepore began the discussion by tracing the history of polls to political journalism of the 1930s, speaking to how their accuracy has dropped since then. She addressed their inaccuracy in the 2016 presidential race, saying that while polls in the 1930s had a 90 percent response rate, polls today have a response rate in the single digits.
“The accuracy of polls is much worse than it has ever been, which is why there’s so many aggregators like Nate Silver,” she said. “They are just trying to correct the inevitable distortion of polls because people refuse to participate in them. Polls have been wrong all over the world for the last three years repeatedly, yet polls are relied upon and have influenced the American political process more than ever before.”
Laibson followed up on Lepore’s comments with research on the economic motives that could explain Trump’s victory. He pointed out that Trump voters were overwhelmingly individuals who had lost faith in the economy, showing the audience charts illustrating wage decrease for American males without college degrees over the last 50 years.
Laibson said that 78 percent of people who said their families were “worse off today than yesterday” voted for Trump, compared to 46 and 24 percent of people who said their families were “about the same” and “better off” respectively.
“For a lot of people in our country, what we think of broadly as the American dream... is slipping away,” he said. “If we look at the generations that we can observe and the generations to come, most children’s life quality will diminish relative to their parents. That’s possible because the gains from economic progress are going to a very small set of elites, well represented on this campus, and not going to the vast majority of our population.”
Allen highlighted the increased divide in educational opportunities across the country, saying that opposing sides had failed to listen and empathize with each others’ plights.
“We face the question of ‘can we fashion’ our social and economic relations to support liberty and justice for all?” she said. “In this election, rural Americans, and Americans without college degrees, sought release from a system of inequality. Sadly, their fine aspirations have gotten wretchedly mixed up with the desires of the David Dukes among us, among them, the President-elect.”
Andrew H. Bellisari, a  graduate student in the History Department, said he came to the event to debrief the day after the election and process his thoughts. Bellisari thought that the candidates intelligently examined the circumstances around the election, but still thought that Dark and Stormy confirmed many stereotypes Trump supporters might believe about Harvard.
“Here is all of Harvard, Cambridge—educated elite coming here and, freaking out, quite frankly, about what has just happened,” he said. “I could almost see the Facebook posts of certain family members or friends taking extraordinarily sick pleasure in watching us deconstruct this moment the way we have.”

With the unionization election just one week away, eligible graduate and undergraduate voters have begun considering the cost of membership dues in a potential student union.
Teaching and research assistants from across the University will head to the polls next Wednesday and Thursday to vote for or against authorizing the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers as their collective bargaining unit.
A student union—which, if approved, would include all eligible voters regardless of their preference—would collect fees from its members to pay for union services. Some students at Harvard have expressed concerns or confusion over paying those dues. When Graduate Student Council President Darcy L. Frear solicited questions about unionization at the Council’s monthly meeting last week, “the biggest recurring question we have received is about union dues,” she wrote in an email.
“I think ‘how much are dues?’ is one of the first questions generally asked when a student learns about the union,” Frear wrote.
HOW DUES WORK
The benefits of union representation come with the cost of dues, which unions use to provide services such as a strike fund, organizers, and legal staffing. The United Auto Workers’ base rate for dues is 1.44 percent of income.
HGSU-UAW spokesperson and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis wrote in an email that graduate student union members affiliated with the UAW across the country “are paying dues to help us win our union because they know that unions can improve the lives of workers and that together we can raise the standards for student workers.”
“This is an investment in the voice of student workers in the U.S.,” Nicoludis wrote.
Union organizers have stressed that dues will not be collected until after a suitable contract is negotiated and approved. Nicoludis wrote that the money “would be taken out of each paycheck for teaching or research work, with written permission from each member.”
If a majority of eligible student voters authorize the HGSU-UAW as their union, all students within the bargaining unit would be required to become members and pay dues, or be non-members and pay agency fees. A worker cannot opt out of a union, particularly because everyone in the bargaining unit stands to benefit from any potential gains the union achieves, according to University of Oregon Professor Gordon Lafer, who works at the university's Labor Education and Research Center and has been an organizer for several unions.
But students can choose to not be a member and pay the agency fee, which is less than the cost of dues and goes only toward “representation” costs, considered the “costs of negotiating and enforcing the contract at this workplace,” Lafer wrote in an email.
People who pay the reduced agency fee do not contribute to “non-representation” costs, such as “political, charitable, or union-solidarity work,” he added.
Asked if an amount has been set for the agency fee, Nicoludis wrote, “It is a subject of negotiation.”
In a University-wide email that laid out what he viewed as the stakes of unionization, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote that at a rate of 1.44 percent, “a Harvard teaching fellow who receives a stipend of $21,200 would pay union dues of $305 per year.”
STUDENTS WEIGH IN
Undergraduates would pay far less in dues, given that they are not required to teach and typically take home a significantly smaller salary. Despite the lower cost, a few undergrads were skeptical of dues while some graduate students welcomed the additional fees.
Undergraduate course assistant Shira Li ’19 said dues are “definitely one major factor in my distaste for the union.” Li said she makes roughly $2,500 a semester, and estimated she would pay around $30 in dues.
“I guess $30 is not all that significant over the course of the semester, but then also, it’s not zero,” Li said.
Undergraduate teaching fellow Tony Turner ’19 estimated he would pay, if a student union is formed, around $20.
“Which isn’t a lot, but it’s enough. You’d like to have 20 extra dollars in your pocket,” Turner said.
Li said she feels undergraduates don't necessarily have as strong a reason to unionize as do graduate students.
“I think grad students have perhaps good reason to unionize because I believe that teaching is part of their requirements in grad school, in addition to their coursework,” Li said. “So for them it’s a requirement, but for undergrad CAs it’s a choice that we make.”
Some graduate students said they are ready to pay dues. Education School student Joseph C. McIntyre wrote in an email that he is “not worried” about dues, and plans to vote in favor of unionization. He wrote that as he understands it, “if our contract doesn’t increase our salaries enough to make dues worthwhile, then we can vote against the contract in which case we won’t need to pay dues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts narrowly approved the legalization of recreational marijuana on Tuesday night, and Harvard students are pretty excited about it.
“It will definitely benefit communities of color,” Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18, member of the Harvard Democrats. “It’s symbolic of this greater movement to deracialize our criminal justice system.”
By far the closest of the state’s four ballot questions, Question 4 was called by the Boston Globe around midnight. At final tally, 53.6 percent of Massachusetts voters approved the ballot question, with 46.4 percent in opposition. Cambridge was more in favor, with 71.3 percent approving the measure.
Effective Dec. 15, recreational marijuana will be legal for individuals aged 21 and older. The drug will be subject to Mass. state sales tax of 6.25 percent as well as a special 3.75 percent excise tax on marijuana. Cities and towns across the Bay State have the option of adding an additional two-percent tax.
“I think it can provide a lot of revenue to the state and lessen the load on law enforcement,” Undergraduate Council Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said.
According to The Crimson’s election survey, a voluntary questionnaire filled out by more than 2,000 undergraduates, Harvard students largely supported the ballot question; 65 percent of Massachusetts voters at Harvard planned to vote “Yes,” while 15 percent intended to vote “No.” About 18 percent of respondents remained undecided when filling out the survey, which closed on Oct. 20.
The legalization of recreational marijuana served as a small consolation prize for the many undergraduates who supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The Associated Press called the election for her opponent Donald Trump around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday.
“I’m just feeling really happy and really satisfied. Especially with the results from the national election being disappointing,” Shafer-Ray said. “It was definitely a silver lining for us during the night.”
Not all students were excited about the results of the referendum. Matthew E. Cappucci ’19, who opposed Question 4, said he is worried about the proliferation of the drug, given its new legality.
“That is not something I’m at all looking forward to,” Cappucci said. “Now that it’s legalized it’s going to be much more common.”
Despite the prospect of legalization in a little over a month, Harvard will likely follow other universities such as Boston University in upholding the campus ban on marijuana. Harvard’s acceptance of federal funds for research puts it in an awkward legal position given that marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, despite legalization in four states before yesterday’s election.
“If they are in any way jeopardizing federal funding they must be cautious,” Bonsall said. “I also think that before they do that, they would be wise to consult the general student body about how they feel about that.”
California and Nevada joined Massachusetts in legalizing recreational pot during the election. Arizona voters rejected a similar proposal. As of presstime, Maine’s votes on recreational marijuana were still being counted in a tight race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 11, 2016, at 2:11 a.m.
While undergraduates and faculty members alike came to terms with Donald Trump’s unexpected win Wednesday, several professors said they postponed assignments or altered lesson plans to ease students' schedules.
Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who teaches the popular course Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics,” said he made a midterm originally scheduled for Wednesday optional. In his class Computer Science 121: “Introduction to the Theory of Computation,” computer science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 extended the due date of a p-set by from Tuesday to Wednesday.
Mankiw said he decided to make the exam optional after receiving emails early Wednesday morning from “quite a few students” who had stayed up to watch the election, which the Associated Press officially called for Trump around 2:30 a.m Wednesday. Students wrote that it would be hard for them to take the exam given the “lateness of the hour and the bigness of the surprise,” Mankiw said.
“It was a thoroughly, surprisingly close election, and I certainly didn’t expect to stay up as late as I did,” he said. “So I understand why some students stayed up late, and why they ended up feeling pretty exhausted the next day.”
Mankiw, who said in August he would not vote for Trump, added that he did not want his students to have their grades affected because they were “temporarily impaired” by what he termed “a fairly unusual set of national circumstances.”
Other professors updated the content of their Wednesday lectures to reflect the results of the election. Some organized election-related activities for their students.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, an economics professor, showed Hillary Clinton’s concession speech, broadcast live Wednesday morning, during his class Economics 1420: “American Economic Policy.” Caroline Light, a lecturer on Women, Gender, and Sexuality, organized students taking her class U.S. in the World 26: “Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States” into small groups to discuss the meaning of Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”
“I usually lecture because it’s kind of a big [group], or we have a combination of lecture and discussion,” Light said. “But I knew that the moment called for something different.”
History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 said he felt compelled to “deviate from the script” during his class Culture and Belief 49: “American Protest Literature from Tom Paine to Tupac”on Wednesday, and said he grew visibly emotional as he spoke.
“This is one of those moments where we realize that the inheritance that we have been given can be very ugly,” he said. “It’s our responsibility as citizens and as human beings and as people who should be invested in each other’s well-being to rise to the historical moment… and stand up and speak up and speak out to earn our deaths with our lives.”
Some professors refrained from lecturing, instead letting their students do the talking. History professor Nancy F. Cott devoted her class History 1462: “History of Sexuality in the Modern West” to student discussion of their reactions to Trump’s win, while Women, Gender, and Sexuality lecturer Phyllis E. P. Thompson said she designated an hour of her class WGS 1225: “Leaning In, Hooking Up: Visions of Feminism and Femininity in the 21st Century” for conversation.
History lecturer Brett Flehinger said he knew right away that he would be unable to teach his class History 1433: “American Populisms: Thomas Jefferson to the Tea Party + Trump” as usual Wednesday.
“People were emotionally not in a position to learn,” he said. “Students were pretty emotionally knocked down, amount of sadness, tears, and people were clearly very exhausted.”
Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, who teaches Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 17: “Logical Reasoning” and also set aside time for students to discuss their thoughts the election during his Wednesday class, said he felt it was imperative that Harvard faculty members help students consider the results as “engaged citizens.”
“It’d be almost irresponsible to just pretend like nothing had happened and just said, ‘Eh, let’s just proceed with business as usual,’” he said.
Summers had a slightly different take. Had he scheduled a midterm or major assignment for the day after the election, he said, he would not have made it optional or extended the deadline. In justifying his response, he recalled a speech he gave as University President shortly after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
“A couple weeks after 9/11, I gave a talk at morning prayers,” Summers recalled, referring to the short service held every weekday in Memorial Church. “I said that when we carried on our normal work of studying and learning, working and playing, that that was the ultimate way in which we triumphed and didn’t allow ourselves to be diverted from the fundamentally important things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald Trump’s upset victory in the presidential election rattled Harvard’s campus, provoking a particularly strong reaction among students of color who feel they will be disproportionately targeted by his policies.
Many minority students, fearful of how the Trump campaign’s racially charged rhetoric and anti-immigrant policies will manifest in his presidency, gathered in discussion groups hosted by various cultural organizations and affinity groups Wednesday
 Nearly 70 students, most of whom were people of color, crowded Quincy’s Junior Common Room for a town hall hosted by the Harvard Foundation focused on the implications of the election for people of color. Institute of Politics fellow Michael A. Blake, who was re-elected to his New York State Assembly seat Tuesday night, traveled from Hillary Clinton’s election night event in Manhattan to lead the discussion.
In an emotional and intimate conversation, students shared their anxieties and fears for a Trump administration. Discussing hate crimes that have occurred since Trump’s victory, many students expressed fears for their own safety.
“We haven’t made as much progress as we thought we had, and that was a distressing realization for me,” Matthew G. Moore ’19 said.
Ata D. Amponsah ’19 said he was particularly upset by Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke’s endorsement of Trump, and was concerned about Republicans sweeping gubernatorial and Congressional races.
Attendees questioned how to discuss issues of race with conservative-minded peers, as many were minorities, both racially and politically, in their hometowns. Harvard Foundation intern and Harvard Democrats board member Devontae A. Freeland ’19 acknowledged that organizers walked “a tricky line,” as the Foundation does not endorse particular political viewpoints.
“We are a nonpartisan office that deals with issues of race, with a guest speaker who is an elected Democrat,” Freeland said. “We have personal stakes in this, but we weren’t making statements on behalf of the Foundation or the IOP.”
The election results stunned Harvard’s student body, as undergraduates overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton: 87 percent of undergraduates responding to The Crimson’s election survey this year said they would vote for the Democratic candidate.
The student leaders of some affinity groups and cultural organizations held informal events in response to Trump’s election. Renegade Magazine, an art and advocacy collective focusing on issues of social justice, held an unstructured art workshop for members to decompress and respond to the election. Domenica A. Merino ’17, president of Latinas Unidas, sat in Ticknor Lounge for four hours, welcoming members of the group to discuss their feelings on Trump’s victory.
“It was devastating to see so many members feel de-legitimized as women of color,” Merino said.
In Harvard Hall, the College’s Diversity Peer Educators, also nonpartisan, had planned a talk on race, policing, and the Black Lives Matter movement, but instead held a session for reflecting on the election results.
“It caused such a profound emotional and intellectual response among students and members of this community as a whole.” Hannah Lemmons ’20, a diversity peer educator, said. “We obviously felt the need to shift the focus [of the event] to serve as a beneficial space to have people express that response.”
The College’s BGLTQ office, the Women’s Center, and the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion had office hours planned for Thursday. South Asian Women’s Collective president Madhavi L. Narayanan ’17 planned two events for the end of the week, the first a “nonjudgmental” session in which the group's members “can support each other as women of color” and the second a discussion about the future of South Asians under a Trump presidency. Event organizers said they were motivated by student need, praising the broad variety of supportive spaces made available for students, particularly students of color.
“I’m not really focused on turnout [at this event] because there are a lot of spaces that have opened on campus in the last few hours,” Lemmons said. “There are some overlapping times and different focuses for each of these events, so I’m happy that this is just happening in order to provide one more space that might serve one more member of the community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Yard was quiet Wednesday afternoon as students, tired from staying up late to watch the unexpected victory of Donald Trump, walked to and from class.
Trump’s early-morning triumph, called around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, sent waves of shock across Harvard’s largely liberal campus, with some students still struggling to believe the news hours later.
“I feel like it’s a nightmare that’s just come true,” Sophie C. DiCara ’20 said as she passed University Hall. “I’m constantly pinching myself. I feel really alienated from the rest of America–who are these people, that elected someone that is atrocious in every way?”
“I’m just surprised that this would happen and that someone like that would be elected our next president,” Frances H. Lee ’20 said, huddling in her jacket. “I don’t see how someone like him could lead a country like this… everything that we’ve come so far to accomplish has now been set back so many years.”
“Words are difficult to express,” Connor McRobert ’20 said. “It’s really hitting me that this man has been elected… it will certainly affect the lives that he’s marginalized and the identities that he’s stripped throughout this election.”
Over the course of Trump’s controversial campaign, the political outsider’s rhetoric was often polarizing. He promised to ban Muslims from entering the country and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and in his June 2015 speech announcing his intent to run called Mexicans “rapists.”
Harvard administrators and House Faculty deans contacted students throughout the day Wednesday, sending emailed messages of support and offering to host meals and get-togethers.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates that the election had been “particularly difficult and divisive” and that he was aware many students were “worried” about what Trump’s victory could mean for themselves and their families.
“I also know there are others who genuinely see this election as a moment of positive change,” he wrote. “In spite of our differences, we can only move forward as friends, neighbors, and classmates if we develop the capacity to understand and empathize with each other.”
Khurana concluded his message by inviting students to share their thoughts about the election results during an “open Dean’s Office” late Friday afternoon. Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair also sent an email to undergraduates, in which she provided a number of post-election events and conversations.
Faculty deans from Pforzheimer, Lowell, and Adams Houses sent emails over their House lists extending offers of conversation, tea, and cookies.
“Our conversations matter, so come to tea, come to community dinner tomorrow, linger at night in the D hall, talk to one another and to your tutors and to us,” wrote Lowell Faculty deans Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin. “We are here for you and for the community we share.”
Alexander J. Cullen ’18, one of a handful of Trump supporters at Harvard, said he was aware that the majority of the student body was distressed by the election’s results, though he himself was “pleasantly surprised” by Trump’s win.
“The mood on campus has been very depressing,” he said. “I’ve tried to respect people feeling bitter about it. That’s kind of made me more guarded to say super pro-Trump things.”
Some students specifically expressed concern at how Trump’s administration would treat immigrants and undocumented students. Ruben E. Reyes ’19, an active Crimson editorial editor, staged a one-man protest to draw attention to Harvard’s undocumented students. Reyes, whose parents were born in El Salvador, wrapped himself in a Salvadorean flag and, holding a sign that read ‘This is my country too!’ sat on the lap of the John Harvard statue for 15 minutes before  Harvard University Police Department officers asked him to leave.
Anders Angerbjorn ’20 said he was similarly apprehensive about Trump’s immigration policies.
“I know a lot of people who are going to be affected personally, and I suffer with them,” Angerbjorn said.
McRobert said he was determined to move forward despite the gloomy campus atmosphere.
“Someone in the group chat for the Class of 2020 said, ‘We can’t let these moments strip us of the weight of our destiny,’” McRobert said. “We have to be the adults that we once admired and held in high esteem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thousands of people, many of them students, poured into the streets of downtown Boston Wednesday night to protest Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election.
In an upset, Trump won several key swing states and defeated Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee and expected winner, to become the President-elect of the United States. The Boston branch of Socialist Alternative, a national community activism organization, organized the rally, publicizing it through a Facebook event.
“Donald Trump is the next President of the United States. We need to immediately start fighting against him,” the Facebook event reads. “We need to build a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia.”
Hundreds of police officers converged on downtown on Boston as protesters chanted “Not my president,” “No justice, no peace,” and other protest slogans. Some traveled across state lines for the event.
Denise Molina, a student, traveled from Manchester, N.H., to participate.
“Trump is against everything I stand for,” Molina said as she wrapped herself in a Mexican flag.
The rally began at Parkman Bandstand in Boston Common, where protesters gathered around the stand to chant and listen to speakers. The protesters then marched through the Common towards the Massachusetts State House, turning onto the streets surrounding the Common and Public Garden, which Boston police blocked off.
Many protesters carried posters reading “Love trumps hate,” “End sexism and racism,” and “Respect existence or expect resistance.” Many participants voiced concerns about the policy changes Trump could make as President, including on climate change, immigration policies, and race relations.
Other protesters said they worried Trump could limit women’s reproductive rights. Many chanted “My body, my rights” and held posters with statements such as“women’s rights are human rights.”
Brian Pu Ruiz and Nicolas Buonanduci held hands and wore clothing expressing BGLTQ pride as they marched down Tremont Street. They each said they were worried about Trump and his running mate Mike Pence’s values, citing Pence’s views on BGLTQ people, particularly those who are transgender, as a main concern.
On campus Wednesday, many students expressed concerns similar to those of the protesters in Boston. Several Houses held events for students to come together to discuss the election results and offer emotional support to one another other. Some professors offered assignment extensions or postponed exams to allow students to process the election results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell, Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, and Yale. What do these teams all have in common?
They are all mathematically eliminated from contention for the Ivy League championship. It’s down to Harvard and the Killer P’s, Penn and Princeton.
I know it’s shocking, but Harvard is once again in prime position to claim the throne. A win against Penn would guarantee the Crimson four straight Ivy League titles.
But just how exceptional an achievement is four straight?
Well to be honest, I’m not sure a certain football co-writer could go four seconds without saying, “Ivy League football suuuuuucks.” I don’t hate the Player, I just hate the game. And I think it would be a minor miracle if my other co-writer failed to ask four consecutive questions at a press conference. Enter SamDan? More like Exit SamDan.
As you can see, four straight of anything is pretty impressive, but four straight championships would be especially remarkable.
That said, Harvard is certainly not guaranteed to clinch the league on Friday. As you’ll see, more on that later.
CORNELL AT COLUMBIA
Cornell and Columbia have recently been perennial bottom-feeders in the Ancient Eight. After a dominant 3-0 start to the season, the Big Red has dropped its last five contests. Meanwhile, the Lions sit at 2-6, having scored a combined 24 points in their two victories.
Suffice to say, it won’t be pretty.
With the NBA season having started up recently, I thought some basketball analogies were appropriate here.
Cornell and Columbia are seventh and eighth, respectively, in points scored in Ivy League games. Based on these less-than-stellar offenses, we might see more field goal attempts in this game than when Russell Westbrook tries to play one-on-five after deciding the rest of his team is a lost cause.
There may be more turnovers in this game than in a 76ers-Pelicans matchup. Just thinking about watching this hypothetical game is appalling. Boy, am I glad to be a Celtics fan. (Alright, maybe I shouldn’t be talking—the early 2000s were not a good time in Boston.)
One positive note: newspaper correspondents won’t have to suffer through bland, Gregg Popovich-style postgame interviews. Columbia coach Al Bagnoli was openly critical of his team after playing Harvard, and the Lions actually put up a good fight against a top-tier opponent.
When it’s all said and done, however, Big Red fans will be more red in the face than Brian Scalabrine when he returns to the bench after a few garbage-time minutes. Coming off a near win against Harvard, the Lions will grind out a close one at home.
Prediction: Columbia 13, Cornell 10
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
As I’ve noted before, Rhode Island and New Hampshire are pretty much inconsequential. The southern half of the Granite State is basically just a suburb of Boston, and the northern part is an extension of Canada. Not much to see there.
Rhode Island is, likewise, just a suburb of Boston. Now that I think about it, Boston is pretty much synonymous with New England.
Just as these two states bordering Massachusetts do not immediately come to mind when you hear the phrase “New England,” their Ivy League football teams are also of little importance this year.
The Bears are who we thought they were, as they sit at a mediocre 2-3 record in league play. The Ivy League expert analysts (wait, that’s us) predicted Dartmouth to finish near the top of the standings in 2016, but the Big Green has instead come up little in conference games, going 1-4 so far.
Dartmouth picked up its first Ivy win last week against Cornell, and I predict the Big Green to keep up that momentum against Brown. Quarterback Jack Heneghan has impressed after being benched at the start of the Harvard game.
One bright spot for Bears fans is that they are better than at least one of their Ancient Eight rivals. Adding to the general list of Yale’s failures was a 27-22 defeat against Brown last week.
Prediction: Dartmouth 26, Brown 17
PRINCETON AT YALE
Yale will use this contest as a tuneup for the premier Ivy League showdown of the season, Harvard-Yale. The Bulldogs have a prime opportunity in the penultimate week to figure out how best to lose to the Crimson, and Princeton will gladly provide that chance.
Princeton, aside from its nail-biting loss to the Crimson, has dominated the Ivy League this year. The Tigers have scored 183 points in five league games and have only allowed 50. That’s a point differential of plus-133. To put that in perspective, Penn is in a distant second at plus-52.
Yale, on the other hand, has struggled yet again. I think I’ve already disparaged the Bulldogs enough, so I’ll just present some unbiased statistics.
In eight contests, the defense has allowed 294 points. For comparison, Princeton has allowed 140 in as many games.
The offense has been adequate with 179 total points, but it has not been enough to bail out the defense.
In addition, Yale has lost by margins of 55-13, 63-35, and 42-7. I think we’ve seen enough here.
Prediction: Princeton 48, Yale 9
HARVARD AT PENN
Finally, a compelling matchup.
Sure, Princeton’s game against Yale has playoff implications. But as I mentioned above, it’s not like the Bulldogs are going to come close to beating the Tigers. Harvard-Penn will go down as the most entertaining and captivating game of the 2016 Ivy League slate.
Most weeks, Around the Ivies readers can feel fairly certain they will read some witty commentary disparaging Harvard’s opponent and then see a prediction that calls for a double-digit Harvard victory.
However, this week is different. Harvard diehards surely will not enjoy reading this section. In fact, I’ll say it now: Penn will beat Harvard Friday night in Philadelphia.
While the Crimson is 5-0 in Ivy play and has only lost to Holy Cross this year, its wins have been slightly less convincing than in years past. In its last three victories, including an overtime thriller over Princeton, Harvard’s average margin of victory is only four points.
The result of the 2016 presidential election may not be the only transfer of power from Harvard to Penn we will see this year.
If Harvard loses this game, it would be tied with Penn for first place in the Ivy League, and there would most likely be a three-way tie after Yale’s inevitable drubbing at Princeton’s hands. The championship would be completely up for grabs in the final week.
I’ve heard rumblings that Nate Silver has Harvard at a 70 percent chance of winning the league. As we’ve seen, that’s far from guaranteed.
Prediction: Penn 31, Harvard 27

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s janitors will vote on whether to give their bargaining committee the authority to call a strike if a contract agreement with the University is not reached by Nov. 15, according to a union spokesperson.
Eugenio H. Villasante, a spokesperson for 32BJ SEIU—the regional union that represents more than 700 of Harvard’s custodial workers and security guards stationed across Cambridge and Boston—wrote in an email that the vote will take place at noon Thursday at the Science Center. SEIU has been bargaining with the University since Oct. 7.
Their vote comes less than a month after Harvard’s dining service workers went on strike for 22 days in an effort to push through their proposals on health care and wage increases. Ultimately, the settlement agreed upon by HUDS and the University made it possible for full-time dining employees to make a $35,000 annual salary and did not result in increases to out-of-pocket health care expenses.
SEIU has thus far not provided specifics about their aims in this round of negotiations. Villasante has said previously that their aims are similar to those of HUDS, though he has not said how the dining workers’ settlement would affect SEIU’s negotiations.
“Broadly speaking, the main bread and butter issues are fair wage increases to keep up with the rising cost of living, maintaining affordable family health care and ensuring adequate funds for retirement,” Villasante wrote in an email.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email last week, when SEIU union members began demonstrating at locations around campus, that “Harvard has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with SEIU. We continue to negotiate in good faith towards a mutually beneficial agreement.”
