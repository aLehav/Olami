After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It would be too simple to write off last week’s tumultuous balloon incident as a twisted misdirection of the public by a few Colorado kooks looking for their fifteen minutes. The hoax’s exposure brings with it another one of much greater significance. Obsessive television coverage of “Balloon Boy” is indicative of the media’s own sordid state. This episode brings to light a news environment in which sensationalism trumps responsible reporting and where the quick sell far outweighs any shade of journalistic integrity.
As the balloon flew last Thursday, rabid coverage filled the airwaves and the Internet. It was forced into the public consciousness and crowded out almost all other news for hours. While Balloon Boy’s father and his convoluted morality may have sparked the media fire, lingering on the hoax itself should not distract from identification of the other, larger, problem at issue—that is, the essence of Richard Heene’s plot was to exploit a sensationalist media. He knew his story would explode as soon as the media caught wind, giving him all the attention he could want. The media reaction only proved Heene right.
Granted, it was impossible to know for sure that Falcon Heene was not inside the balloon. However, the mainstream media’s utter lack of skepticism is troubling and was far from prudent or excusable. The first phone call made by Falcon’s father to the local television affiliate was met by a stubborn, “I don’t believe you.” It was only after Heene put a police deputy on the line that the local station reluctantly sent up its helicopter to investigate. In contrast to this commendable local reporting, cable-news anchors expressed no such skepticism upon picking up the story and instead gladly broadcast spectacular images of the flight, salivating as their ratings doubled on the hour.
Even after the boy was found safely at home, the mainstream media persisted in its sensationalism. They awarded the family several rounds of interviews in the days following the flight to keep the ratings-grabbing story alive. Upon exposure that it was a hoax two weeks in the making, the media persisted, conducting interviews with the Heenes’ lawyer and dispatching reporters to follow them to such mundane venues as their local Wal-Mart.
The broader mess is not free of other culprits. The police should not have continued expressing their belief in Heene’s story once they had secured evidence that it was a hoax, which happened as early as the night of the incident itself. Even if this disclosure could only come at the expense of the family’s cooperation, it is not legitimate civil practice to deceive the public. The Heenes too, of course, are at fault, and the state of Colorado may yet charge them with three felonies for their brash fame-seeking. If upheld, such charges could result in as many as six years in prison and $500,000 in fines. But the biggest culprit was the media, which forgot that its primary responsibility is not to tell unverified tall tales, but to report the facts.
In reporting this event in the way it did, the mainstream media tacitly reaffirmed Heene’s belief in its own sensationalism and put this obvious yellow bent on display for the world to see. We encourage the media to take a close look at its coverage over the past week. Next time a similarly fantastical story should break, CNN, Fox News, and others must be more skeptical and ask more questions before jumping on board and letting the story supersede every other newsworthy issue. Such incidents do have a place in the news, but the media must be more judicious in assigning that place if it cares at all to maintain its own credibility.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council is used to the accusation of being out of touch with undergraduates. While the body is on every new student’s mind freshman fall, enthusiasm seems to die out once students become upperclassmen. House representatives are more difficult to recruit, and voter apathy is prevalent. It is therefore encouraging to see the UC acknowledging the problem and taking measures to solve it.
The UC plans to change students’ indifferent attitudes toward it through new legislation calling the formation of the UC-House Committee liaison program. Starting this year, representatives from the UC will be required to be present at their respective house’s weekly HoCo meetings. We welcome this new approach and hope the UC takes full advantage of it.
This new initiative aims to reconnect students with the UC by becoming more involved with house life. The legislation will also allow the UC to receive feedback from HoCos and be more involved in students’ lives. A dialogue between the two student bodies will help fortify ties between the UC and its constituents, making student concerns better heard. This will also dovetail well with the UC’s new efforts to acquire more data on different topics concerning student life in the form of surveys and polls, which were also set forth in the recent legislation.
The increased focus on HoCos also calls attention to the need to monitor spending of UC funds and highlights problems with house budgets. Currently, HoCos receive their funding from the UC, and all houses, regardless of their size, work under the same budget. It would be wise for the UC to review this arrangement and consider updating it reflect the large disparities in size between houses. Bigger houses might need bigger funds. The UC can take the opportunity to investigate whether money is being properly managed and propose new ideas.
The UC seems to be actively trying to get more in touch with students. We hope they remain excited about these new approaches and that students respond in kind.

The name of one of Rupert Murdoch’s more controversial projects, Fox News Channel, is something of a misnomer. The channel cannot be considered an objective source of information by any stretch of the imagination, and to deem it “news” is an insult to the very idea of what true journalism is. The list of misdeeds and controversies in which Fox has been embroiled are a Wikipedia page long, and the jesters whom they now seem fond of employing represent little more than proof that, in America, dishonesty and insanity do not preclude gainful employment. Every time one believes that the absurdity of Fox’s behavior has reached its acme, it surpasses itself by redefining what is truly absurd, at times even devolving into hysterics.
Given Fox’s constant attacks on reason and manipulation of the facts—even including the events they report—it is shocking and disappointing that so much of the American public appears to be captivated by that duplicity. The onus is on more credible news sources to expose Fox News for what it really is. Unfortunately, the once-vaunted CNN, with a few exceptions, seems more concerned with Balloon Boy than with exposing Fox’s lies concerning the most important issues of our day.
But even if slothful mainstream media outlets cannot take up the task of challenging Fox, the burden of delegitimizing it shouldn’t fall on the executive branch. Recently, White House Communications Director Anita Dunn made clear just how concerned the White House is in her indictment of Fox as “a wing of the Republican Party.” That slip reveals that the White House is in fact concerned with the lies surrounding the national discourse—concerned enough to attack it in an official public-relations capacity.
It is unclear what political ends the Obama administration is hoping to achieve with this confrontational approach to Fox. This is a news channel that thrives on controversy, and its anchors glut on polemics. Its audience seems captive to the lies of Glenn Beck and co., but they appear unlikely to trust the words of any politician, even the most charismatic one. Furthermore, the White House will hardly be viewed as an objective arbiter of the truth if it continues to level such retaliations in the wake of the national imbroglio that is the health-care “debate.” And even if the administration could critique Fox from a position of unquestionable credibility, ad hominem assaults are not the way to dispel the fogs of fiction.
At a time when myths and half-truths pose serious threats to intelligent discourse and one of the greatest problems of our generation—health care—must be engaged with seriously, these schoolyard antics on the part of both Fox and the White House neither are politically expedient nor do they move debate forward. The White House should take Fox’s deliberate deceptions seriously, but there are more intelligent ways to deal with lies than picking a fight that can’t be won at a reasonable cost. For now, the focus should be on what is being said, not who is saying it. People barely understand health-care reform as it stands, and entering the fray with fists flailing and insults flying provides the American public with neither assurance nor the truth.

To the editors:
Each year, without fail, The Crimson publishes an editorial denouncing Columbus Day. Yet again, the editorial board has exposed a saddening ignorance of what the holiday represents to many people in this country, specifically Italian Americans.
The significance of the celebration of Columbus Day is tied uniquely to Columbus’s Italian ethnicity and Catholic faith. While The Crimson’s anti-Columbus Day editorial bemoans “Euro-centrism,” they have conveniently forgotten that sad time in recent American history when Catholic ethnic immigrants—especially Italian Americans—were subject to violence and discrimination. It was a time when the expulsion of Southern European “inferiors” from this land was the objective of mainstream nativists in American politics, many of whom found moral support from the Puritan bigots of this university.
Not only did Columbus “inspire generations of men and women to search out the farthest reaches of the world” and “help lay the foundation on which America was built,” as President Barack Obama stated this Columbus Day—his legacy gave Italian Americans a powerful reminder of their people’s contributions to this country, at a time especially when their citizenship and patriotism was so unfairly and maliciously impugned. Each Columbus Day, our nation participates in what is now a 150-year-old tradition of honoring Italian contributions to American society, which began with Christopher Columbus.
The ongoing historical debate over the personal merits of Christopher Columbus is reserved for another time and place. For now, consider that many figures in American history are remembered for their accomplishments rather than their participation in the follies of their respective eras. We honor George Washington no less on Presidents’ Day because he owned slaves, but rather we honor him as the father of our country. To sacrifice the reputation, dignity, and heroism of a visionary man as a “symbol” for the worst excesses committed by colonial governments is both unfair and obtuse. Christopher Columbus—in his courage, independence of mind, and strong faith—rather symbolizes what was best about our civilization, not what was worst.

To the editors:
It’s hard to believe that pre-law students at one of the most prestigious universities in the world would object to letting a war hero like James W. Gilchrist speak at their campus about the “Minutemen” and their position on immigration reform (“Anti-Illegal Alien Speaker Banned,” News, Oct. 19). Gilchrist is a Purple Heart veteran who nearly died protecting these insecure future lawyers’ right to speak. It is a sad day in America when those who typically advocate free speech want to silence any opposing view. This trend is becoming far too common and is making many in our country very uneasy. Intellectually honest people understand the importance for all perspectives to be included in any debate. That is, as long as those perspectives are based on logic and fact, not rhetoric and emotion. I believe the students who oppose Mr. Gilchrist formed their position on rhetoric and emotion. They are obviously ignorant about what Mr. Gilchrist and the Minutemen are concerned with.

Last month, Ben Bernanke told the Brookings Institution that the recession “is very likely over.” Technically, he is correct: GDP will grow this quarter, and the International Monetary Fund projects a 1.5 percent increase next year. Yet unemployment reached 9.8 percent last month, a 25-year high, and will likely continue climbing. This is to be expected, as joblessness typically rises for nearly 18 months after GDP growth turns positive. Due to this recession’s severity, most economists expect unemployment to return to pre-recession levels in three to five years. As Bernanke acknowledges, it doesn’t feel like the end of a recession for many Americans.
Republicans have used this news to prematurely declare the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act a failure. This is intellectually dishonest, given that three-quarters of it has not yet been spent. According to the Council of Economic Advisors, even the fraction paid out so far added two to three percent to second-quarter GDP growth and created or saved hundreds of thousands of jobs (although the exact number is up for debate). Clearly, joblessness would be higher today without the stimulus.
Regardless, Congress recognizes that further action is necessary to combat unemployment. Proposals under debate include increased aid to states, a business tax credit for new hiring, and extended unemployment benefits. These measures, while helpful, constitute a Band-Aid response to a much larger problem. Given that many job losses are concentrated in construction and manufacturing, a superior plan would directly stimulate demand for raw materials and finished products. With America in need of profound investment in 21st-century infrastructure, and so much labor currently on the sidelines, the obvious solution would fund a massive transportation and school-construction program and provide greater support for green energy endeavors. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama promised to support these initiatives; now is the time to transform rhetoric into action.
America has outgrown its 1950s-era transportation network—the crumbling Tappan Zee Bridge in New York and L.A. rush-hour traffic serve as living proof. Congressman Jim Oberstar, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has proposed legislation that would spend $500 billion over six years on highway, mass-transit, and high-speed-rail construction. The bill will create an estimated six million jobs—twice as much as the stimulus can under the most optimistic projections. Unfortunately, President Obama plans to table this bill until 2011 in an effort to save political capital for health-care and climate legislation. While the president’s motives are understandable, stopgap measures are unacceptable when a badly needed long-term vision is on the table.
Studies estimate that bringing public schools into a state of good repair will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. States and school districts, which typically finance construction, cannot afford such an expense without federal funding, especially during a recession. The stimulus paid out $44 billion to school districts, but many are spending this funding on preventing teacher layoffs and cutbacks rather than renovation. Two bills that passed the House this year would provide $4 to $6 billion for school construction and modernization. Funding that will create construction jobs while improving the quality of education (a key determinant of long-term economic growth) is worthy of Senate passage.
Though America has a growing hunger for green energy, it is lagging in the race to build large manufacturers of solar panels, wind turbines, and lithium-ion batteries. This means it is also failing to create “green-collar jobs” with the potential to reverse America’s manufacturing decline. In contrast, Germany, China, and Spain are home to global leaders in clean-energy manufacturing, not to mention thousands of green jobs. These companies were supported by long-term price guarantees for green power, national mandates on utilities to generate renewable energy, and generous investment subsidies. To achieve similar results, we must emulate our competitors’ policies.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, used public-works construction to curb unemployment and fight the Depression. But these New Deal projects also boosted long-run growth by creating infrastructure still in use today, like the Grand Coulee Dam and LaGuardia Airport. We now find ourselves in a similar situation, with millions seeking employment and a nation in need of new schools, highways, and industries. Under FDR, the Three Rs stood for “relief, recovery, reform.” To successfully reduce unemployment while laying a foundation for tomorrow’s economic growth, President Obama’s economic policy must include a fourth R: renewal.

It’s no secret that Harvard has been struggling financially due to the recession—University Hall’s endowment woes (and resulting budget cuts) have come under constant scrutiny not only by The Crimson, but also by national newspapers such as The Boston Globe and The New York Times. But just in case you’ve been living under a rock for the past few months, FM has gathered some stats on the recession’s effects on Harvard, ranging from the obvious to the surprising to the potentially infuriating. Just remember: regardless of what our endowment is and what our administrators get paid, there is “a wealth of intellectual opportunity within this university.” Yeah, thanks, President Faust.
Drop in Harvard’s endowment between June 2008 and June 2009: $11 billion
Number of countries in 2008 with nominal GDPs smaller than $11 billion, according to the World Bank: 68
Amount of liquid cash holdings, typically used only for daily expenses, lost due to risky investments: $1.8 billion
Years for which $1.8 billion could have continued to pay for hot breakfasts: 2,000
President Drew G. Faust’s total compensation, up $17,009 since Larry Summer’s final year: $775, 043
Provost Steven E. Hyman’s total compensation, up $90,446 from previous year: $570, 265
Number of employees laid off in June 2009: 275
Amount of raises and bonuses to be accrued by faculty and non-union workers in 2010: $0
Voluntary pay cut of Stanford’s top administrators this year, including the President and Provost: 10%
Increase in Provost Hyman’s salary from previous year: 19%
Drop in payroll for teaching staff this year: $2 million
Number of sections reduced due to a drop in hiring for TAs/TFs: 450Target class size for sections this year, up from last year’s average of 13: 18
Minimum fine, up from $75, for all lost library books and materials in the Harvard College Library, which includes Widener, Lamont, and Houghton. A new $10 “non-refundable billing fee” will also be added per item: $100
Average price for a hardcover fiction book in 2008, according to the School Library Journal. The average price for a hardcover nonfiction book in 2008 was $25.38.: $27.47

Fred Ho ’79 was skeptical when he got a Voicemail from John Lithgow ‘67 asking him to call back.  “I wasn’t going to return it because I thought it was a robocall,” he explained. But the message was indeed intended for Ho, the 2009 recipient of the Harvard Arts Medal, honoring achievement in the arts and contribution to the public good.
Over the past twenty years, Ho, an accomplished baritone saxophonist, has dreamed up inventive compositions, theater productions, multicultural ensembles, and literary works which fuse the African-American roots of the jazz tradition with his Chinese-American heritage and his commitment to social justice.
Coming from liberal Amherst, Massachusetts in the 1970’s, Ho found Harvard to be “white, stiff, sterile, and square.”
“I was pretty unhappy except for when I was organizing and challenging the dominant ideology,” said Ho, a self-described “unapologetic Marxist” who helped found multiple Asian-American organizations and fought for minority rights while at Harvard.
Classmate and activist Bill Fletcher Jr. ’76 describe Ho as a “dynamo.”
“He had an immense amount of energy, asked a lot of questions, and was thirsting after new knowledge,” said Fletcher.
As a member of the Jazz Band, Ho was one of only a handful of students in its history to compose an ensemble piece. But he dropped out of the Band during his sophomore year to focus on activism, and his signature fusion of Chinese and African-American musical styles did not develop until after graduation.
Today, his productions combine martial arts, dance, poetry, and music to represent cultural unity, social struggle, and power.
Ho’s unique style is not limited to his music.  A self-proclaimed nudist, he is naked and painted green on the cover of his newest book. And he lovingly refers to the small patch of hair shaved on his head as his “vulva vector” or “pussy patch,” a representation of the vagina and his support of matriarchal politics.
“As I get older in numerical age I get even more radical and fearless,” said Ho.
“He has never picked the easy way out or picked any of the obvious choices,” said classmate and fellow saxophonist Salim Washington ’93 PhD ’00. “Here is a person who has dedicated his art to his political ideals. Even when many people who used to be on the same path have renounced their principles, he has stood firm.”

I don’t usually talk between 12 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. on Sundays. This isn’t, I hope, some sort of cod philosophical practice; I’m not trying to clear my mind (you can never really do that); I’m eating a chicken cutlet sandwich. Barbeque sauce, bacon, and melted mozzarella is how I take them, a little honey mustard if I’m feeling it.
I do this partly because it reminds me of home—my local deli calls this the Brano Bomber—and partly because, when combined with a glass bottle of Yoo-hoo it forms one of the all-time great hangover cure tag-teams. But mostly I do this just because I like sandwiches, and for the continuity.
My mom is a big people-watcher and I think that I inherited a little bit of it from her. But where she’s interested in what people are saying to each other, I pay more attention to the way people navigate and—because I’m in almost the same spot every week—to patterns. There’s a guy with a blue bicycle who has crashed on the same spot three times this year, an old lady who crosses Brattle Street at needlessly perfect right angles, and tour groups with matching beverages. All this against the eternal background flow of customers into their footwear-appropriate shops (Nike SB Dunks to American Apparel, loafers to Burdick).
A pattern emerged in the late ’00s where everybody stopped waking up before 1 p.m. on Sunday. This isn’t at all a terrible idea, it gets you up just in time for the early football games and most places (except McDonald’s) are still serving breakfast.  McDonald’s breakfast ends at 11 o’clock exactly, there is no getting around this, the menus are on a timer, unless you get a key to the manager’s office the night before and change the settings, or push the clocks back manually, still though the employees probably have watches. You can’t really blame people for waking up late on Sundays really; the only thing they’re missing is The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross and there can be only so many happy little trees.
Not really sure why, but I’m rallying against all of these patterns with a pattern of my own. Last week, however, my pattern was interrupted. I had the normal sandwich, this time with a Baja Blast Mountain Dew® and I sat down on my bench. I was halfway through my sandwich, on the bench with my headphones on, when a kid somewhere between 5-11 years old sat next to me. I can’t really tell how old kids are because, other than a summer camp counselor gig after senior year, I try to stay away from them. They punch and shit. This kid was wearing a Mets hat though so I figured he was a normal and reasonable person, I just kept eating. I watched as he similarly unwrapped a big sandwich and started in on it. I sort of wondered where the kid’s parents were, but I decided to leave it be and continue on with the sandwich and the enjoying my music. Then I got a tap on the arm, and I took off my headphones.
“Wanna trade?” the kid said, and presented to me a half sandwich that I was immediately drawn to. An unsteady handful of crisp wax paper edges, this kid was holding a beast. Turkey, capicola (say ‘gabagool’), roast beef, tomato, lettuce, and what smelled like horseradish dressing all warmed on a perfect looking half hero. I took a look at my sandwich, the old stand-by, and I briefly weighed my options. Then the responsible, mature thought occurred to me; I couldn’t trade food with this little kid. He might be allergic (these days it seems like every kid is), contagious, or I might get him sick.
“Nah man,” I say with my deep man voice, “I admire your style but I can’t be doing shit...I mean stuff like that.” With a crumpling flourish, he withdrew his sandwich.  The next part of this story is completely true and wholly unexpected. Putting his little-person hand on my iPod (which was on the bench next to me), he said “I’m gonna chuck this shit.”  “No you’re not,” I said, only half-seriously because I couldn’t possibly anticipate what was going to happen next.
He wound up and I froze; I couldn’t forcibly stop this little kid I didn’t know, and I still half thought that he was faking. Some gasping syllable came out of my mouth just as I felt a tug on the still-connected headphones around my neck, and the release as momentum freed the iPod.  It hit a metal trash can straight on, then skidded off into the street making with a sound like a row of people dropping their cell phones one after the other. None of this happened in slo-motion.
I ran down the street and the kid ran away, fast. I’m pretty sure I heard him say “I can’t believe I just did that,” but that might have just been me projecting my thoughts. Just before I reached my iPod, a heavily tattooed guy with a ZZ-Top beard picked it off the floor and gave it a look. “It’s okay man...I secretly listen to Norah Jones too.”

Last Thursday, students gathered for a colorful conversation at the Harvard Foundation-sponsored student panel The Color of Love: Interracial Dating at Harvard. The discussion centered around the intricacies of Harvard’s interracial dating scene–covering the beautiful, the awkward, and the absurd.
Students became increasingly open up as the night unfolded.  Panelist Kimberly N. Foster ’11 discussed the touchy situation of bringing her white boyfriend home for Thanksgiving.  Teake ’12 recounted awkward conversations with his high school girlfriend’s family in which her father would talk about setting her up with Asian boys.
Panelists also commented on the fact that some Harvard students fetishize the prospect of dating someone of another race.  Linda D. Chavers, a graduate student in the audience, remembered how a white man tried to gain her affections by mentioning that while he had never dated a black woman, he had seen a lot of porn.
Students also pointed out less extreme examples of fetishization, referring in particular to the phenomenon of “Yellow Fever.”
“I have a few white friends who really love Asian women as potential mates,” said panelist Daniel C. Suo ’10. While agreeing that curiosity for interracial dating can be  good, panelists explored the problems that arise when people view interracial relationships to be based on sexual fantasy, not love.
Students praised the panel for its approach to the controversial issue. “They were sensitive to the fact that people use humor to relieve the anxiety surrounding the topic,” said Ross P. Ford ’12.
For those of you thinking about getting serious with that cutie from section, you might want to consider Foster’s words of wisdom: “Love is hard to come by.  If you find it, don’t let it go.”

Amy Hempel is widely regarded as the queen of the American short story. She has published several collections and has received countless awards for her fiction. As she prepares for her latest honor—the PEN/Malamud Award for the Short Story—FM caught up with Harvard’s newest Briggs-Copeland lecturer to talk about craft, the weather, and Wanita, her yellow lab.
1.Fifteen Minutes (FM): So, what’s your dog’s name? What kind of breed is she?
Amy Hempel (AH): Well, this is my yellow lab Wanita, spelled W-A-N-I-T-A, not the correct way. She’s affiliated with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. She was trained to be a guide and the school decided to pass the good genes along, so she’s in their Brood/Stud program—her puppies become guide dogs. I’ve worked with the organization for about 14 years, doing some of the puppy raising and pre-training. So she’s still part of the Guide Dog program. FM: And is she well-behaved, or does she get into trouble? AH: (Laughs) She’s impeccable! She’s really well-behaved, except for what you just experienced—she’s a little over-enthusiastic in her greeting. She just loves everybody.
2. FM: Speaking of dogs, it seems that animals are a pretty pervasive theme in your work—you refer to a chimp who knows sign language in “In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried” and you even published “Unleashed: Poems By Writers’ Dogs”—an anthology of poems written from the point of view of dogs.
AH: Right, with Jim Shepard.
FM: Any reason for this theme?
AH: Well, I love animals. I have to have them in my life, dogs in particular. I just find them endlessly interesting and funny and moving. In the Al Jolson story, the first story I wrote, I had followed ape language experiments for many years—I just was interested in them. And I got to meet Coco in California many years ago, the gorilla who was taught sign language and that was a truly life-changing experience, sitting down with this gorilla who could communicate with me. Yeah, it was extraordinary. So, I’d heard about this story years before I even started writing, and I just knew sometime that I would use it.
3. FM: What’s your writing process? How do you begin crafting your stories—do you have a specific format, or do you just let it flow?
AH: It’s changed over the years. I wrote my first two collections of stories between the hours of midnight and 4 a.m. and then I had to change and actually learn to work in the daytime, and then I tried working first thing in the morning before I did anything. And now I have no process at all. It’s up for grabs.
4.FM: You’ve pretty much built your reputation writing short stories. What do you like best about this genre? Why do you prefer it to the novel or longer pieces?
AH: Well, I have one novella, but you know, short stories and short-short stories are what come naturally to me. And I think it has partly to do with the way you experience life, or a given day. I’m not big on cause and effect. It always seems contrived to me on the page. Well, not always, but often, at least when I do it. So I like moments. Something small shifted there and that’s interesting. I like moments that effect a change, that accumulate.
5.FM: Have you ever considered writing a novel?
AH: No.
FM: No?
AH: (Laughs) No—I might have another novella in mind, but I have no interest in or need to write a novel. I mean, I like reading them, but I don’t have anything in me that says “Oh, you gotta write a novel.”
6. FM: Did you always know you wanted to be a writer? When did it hit you?
AH: It ran as a concurrent theme—concurrent with wanting to be a vet as a little girl. I didn’t start writing for real until I was in my mid to late twenties, but I’d always worked with animals and veterinarians. I’d been a surgical assistant for one. Oh, wait, do you hear that? Snoring dog in the background!
FM: (Laughs)
AH: Anyway, a book like “Unleashed,” which you mentioned—Jim Shepard and I decided to do that, and we gave half the money it made to animal charities and it’s still earning money for them, which is great, it makes me feel very good. So, much of my writing is still interconnected with animal concerns in a big way.
7.  FM: In a New York Times review of your collection “At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom,” the reviewer wrote, “Since the publication of her first collection of stories, ‘Reasons to Live,’ Amy Hempel has frequently been labeled (libeled?) as a minimalist.” So what do you think about that? Does being labeled a minimalist define you correctly, or not?
AH: No, no. It became sort of a lazy reviewer tool or label. And a number of writers were labeled minimalists. It became somewhat pejorative when it was more widely used some years back, and the person who came up with the more accurate term was Ray Carver, who said, “Well, you’re actually a precisionist!” He included me and a couple others, including Mary Robison, and himself. We’re precisionists. It wasn’t about what we left out, although that can be important too, but that’s the description that I much prefer. And, coming from Carver...well, excuse me, but that’s pretty great.
8. FM: So if you’re a “precisionist” in your writing, does that taste apply to other areas of your life? I mean, do you focus a lot on detail?
AH: Well, I do, often to the detriment of what I’m supposed to be doing. I’ve said to a few people: “Well, I’m the person who goes to a fascinating lecture, but what I’m paying attention to is the kind of barrette the lady in row three is using to hold her hair up and when it’s about to fall out.” So again, details, certainly, but it’s not always a gift.
(Editor’s Note: Wanita wakes up, climbs on the couch.)
AH: Up, Wanita, up! Good girl.
(Editor’s Note: The dog promptly falls back to sleep.)
9.  FM: As you mentioned, your first short story was “In the Cemetery where Al Jolson is Buried.” How did the idea for this story come about?
AH: I was in a workshop at Columbia taught by Gordon Lisch, and we had one assignment which was to write your worst secret, the thing you would never live down, or as he put it: “the thing that dismantles the sense of your self.” And so, I was in my late 20s, almost 30 at the time, and I knew the worst secret was I felt I had failed my best friend when she was dying. So that’s why I wrote that story. It wasn’t something I wanted to think about, and I certainly didn’t want to write about it, but it was the assignment, and I thought, “Well, I’m game, and here we go.”
10.FM: Wow. Speaking of this short story, it’s one of the most anthologized works in the last quarter century. Al Jolson was considered to be one of the world’s greatest entertainers. He sang a lot of jazz and blues and influenced a bunch of famous musicians and performers, including Judy Garland and Bob Dylan, who once referred to him as “somebody whose life I can feel.”
AH: Wow, I never heard that. That’s amazing.
FM: Yeah. So, what types of music do you enjoy, and who are some of your favorite artists?
AH: Well, a lot, and you know, I always listen to music when I’m writing. I listen to a lot of soul, Southern soul, and R&B, and I have all those early Verve records—all these old soul singers and blues singers, and I bought a bunch of these old CDs in Southern Mississippi that I listen to a lot. Jimmy Reed, just great old timeless stuff. Anything with real energy and real feeling, I mean, it’s like caffeine to me.
11. FM: Do you draw inspiration from other art forms? What do you love writing about?
AH: Well, I rely on place a lot. My whole first book was “California,” and focused on beach communities and the transient lives there. My novella was actually set in a beach community too. I was urging students that I have here to think about place in terms of what happens in a certain place that doesn’t happen somewhere else, or anywhere else. And that’s how I look at place in fiction. It always interests me that what happens in one place doesn’t happen somewhere else. There’s this book by Saramago, a recent novel, “Death With Interruptions.” He writes about a town in which nobody dies. So, that’s a pretty extreme example of something happening that doesn’t happen anywhere else.
12.  FM: You’re a Briggs-Copeland lecturer here at Harvard, and that lectureship is a big honor in the world of literature. So what’s your day-to-day life as a Briggs-Copeland lecturer like? Any perks?
AH: (Laughs) You know, being here is actually the biggest perk. It sounds so corny, but it’s really thrilling—it’s Harvard! I’ve only just started, honestly, so at this point it’s a bit hard to say what life is like, but this term I’m commuting from New York City, so I come over every week from New York, with that girl over there snoring on the couch, just like she does during office hours. But being here, there’s people whom I’ve read with great admiration, and suddenly they’re over in the next office, so it’s very heady and exciting. The students are remarkable of course. I don’t mean to pander here, but they truly are. The undergraduates here are as accomplished often, as graduate students I’ve worked with other places, so that’s fun for me. One of my brothers came here as an undergrad, and I used to visit him, you know, longingly, when he was in college, so it’s good to have found a way to be here.
13. FM: You teach two fiction courses here at Harvard—“Intro to Fiction Writing” and “Advanced Fiction Writing.” What advice do you have for your students or other aspiring writers?
AH: Well, I think the standard answer would be to read, and that’s certainly important. But they know that already. Well, my teacher used to say, “Stay open for business” which meant, you know, just be open to everything and anything. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten a line that I’ve used in a story, or even started a story with, that came from just eavesdropping. Just listening to people in a theater before a show, at the student center, a coffee shop. You are always on the job. Grace Paley, a writer whom I adored, advised something else: “Keep a low overhead.” But that’s to worry about after graduation I guess.
14. FM: You were born in Chicago. How much worse are Chicago winters than Boston winters?
AH: (Laughs) I think they’re about equal! I’ve had many years spent walking along Lake Michigan with wind chill at -60 or something horrible like that. So Boston doesn’t scare me.
15. FM: And now, a predictable final question: what are your plans for the future?
AH: There’s a famous quote that I put in one of my stories: “If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.” (Laughs) I’m a little superstitious about talking about plans. Put it this way: I’m very happy in the moment, in this moment.
(Editor’s note: Wanita’s snoring reaches its peak.)
She’s dreaming. Look, she’s dreaming. So, yes. I’m very happy with the here and now. You can’t always say that, but right now it’s true.

Humanities concentrators spend much of their college career learning obscure Slavic languages, analyzing the small gestures in English literature, and acquiring a cursory knowledge of philosophy. They contemplate every abstract question but the one that’s been directed at them repeatedly by their parents: “So what are you going to do with that degree?”
But what’s a humanities concentrator to do when the Office of Career Services seems to be solely focused on throwing free-pen-and-Nalgene recruiting events for the aspiring hedge fund crowd? The Crimson e-mailed 106 junior and senior humanities concentrators; 43 of them replied, four of whom said they had experience going to the OCS for help. Most replied that they’ve never had anything to do with the OCS.
“There’s this view among a lot of people in the English department that OCS doesn’t have anything that’s designed for them,” English concentrator Trevor A. Groce ’10 said.Are the rumors true?
Are humanities students doomed to stumble blindly in the job market? After talking to several of them, FM brought their concerns to four OCS counselors to learn about schmoozing, lemmings, and available resources. It turns out that finding a job requires more effort than just graduating from Harvard.
A CONTACT SPORT
According to The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2009, over 50% of graduating Harvard students headed to consulting, finance, and health care. When these are the major roads leading away from Johnston Gate, it may be difficult to find resources off the beaten path.
Assistant Director of Career Services for On Campus Recruiting Deborah Carroll said that the industries that attract humanities concentrators, such as publishing, media, and entertainment, by nature do not recruit on campus.
“The job search is a contact sport no matter what industry you’re looking at,” Carroll said. “And the thing with industries like publishing is that they don’t want a passive way of looking for talent. They want someone who’s really passionate about the job. They want you to find them.” Carroll cited the case of Conde Nast, which actively hid links to their internship application to eliminate the less dedicated.
However, Assistant Director of Career in the Arts Gail Gilmore said that the OCS does offer valuable connections into the industry. For example, OCS partners with Harvardwood, an organization that boasts a 5,000-alumni network and brings students interested in the entertainment industry to Los Angeles each year through its Harvardwood 101 program.
“We often bring back alumni who have successfully navigated the industry for panel discussions,” Interim Director of the Office of Career Services Robin Mount said. “We have fabulous peer-to-peer and alumni connections.”
SEEKING YOUR OWN PATH
Many humanities concentrators looking to go into non-entertainment areas, however, have had difficulty finding opportunities through the­ OCS.
Philosophy and History of Art and Architecture concentrator Matthew H. Coogan ’11 attended an OCS panel on museum internships, but was disappointed that the internships were mostly geared towards graduate students.­­
Coogan says that he is currently looking for opportunities through the HAA department, where he hopes professors will have useful contacts in the field.
Another junior concentrating in History and Literature, who wished to remain anonymous to preserve her relationship with the OCS, said that her experience with the office was “overwhelming.”
“I went to OCS sophomore year because I wanted to apply for an internship in D.C. A guy spent seven minutes with me, and he basically said, ‘You’re too young for any of the jobs,’ and handed me a business card,” she said. “I ended up getting the internship I wanted on my own.”
Assistant Director of Career Services Benny Belvin II said that the OCS should not be thought of as an instant solution for finding jobs.
“You can’t think, ‘OCS, they have to do this for me,’ or, ‘They are my only source.’ Often times you have to take the initiative to connect with alumni, with people in the industry,” Belvin said. “We’re a great start, but we’re not the only start.”
“THE LEMMING FACTOR”
No matter how much time you spend in Houghton Library, there’s no escaping the possibility of a more typical post-Harvard career. Success stories abound: that History and Literature concentrator who received a Bain offer, the Philosophy student who works for Goldman. And when you have only vague outlines of less lucrative life plans, these stories may convince you to trade in your Shakespeare collection for Vault interview guides.
“The finance and consulting companies make a lot of noise, and many students just look for jobs into consulting or finance because their roommates or their friend is doing it,” Mount said. “We call it the Lemming Factor.”
Going into the industry with a humanities degree and little experience, however, may be more difficult than expected.
Philosophy concentrator Marissa A. Babin ’10, is looking into jobs in consulting as one of several post-graduation options.
“There are some companies that don’t care what you majored in,” Babin said. “But recruiting is definitely not as easy as if I had been an economics concentrator.”
Carroll said that the expectation of landing a consulting job without any “pattern of engagement” is unrealistic.
“You have to realize that your competition is among the Harvard students who may be the presidents of investment clubs or who may have had industry internship experiences,” she said.
So what’s a humanities junkie to do? Must they sacrifice six hours of class a week and suffer through econometrics and multi-variable calculus? According to Belvin, the critical first step is self-assessment.
“You have to be realistic. Humanities concentrators should think about how to connect their education to the specific set of skills needed for a job. You need to ask yourself: what skills do I need? How do I get those skills?” he said. “We at the OCS are here to help you figure things out.”

Each year, three lucky Harvard students cash in big—in the most unlikely of ways. The Visiting Committee Prize for Undergraduate Book Collecting doles out money and praise to undergraduates in order to, in their words, “recognize and encourage book collecting by undergraduates at Harvard.” Fifteen Minutes is tickled by this quaint and lucrative award (first place is $1,500), and, like Noah M. Silver ’10, we yearn to see our collection on display in Lamont. And so, Visiting Committee, FM humbly presents its own collection of 15 books and publications.

Devoted fans of “Twilight” eager to quench their vampire thirst may not have to wait an entire month for the next movie installment in the series. The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, has been working with Vintage Press, the publisher of “Twilight”, on “Nightlight”, a book parody of the vampire-human romance set to release November 3—fortunately for crazed fans, only two weeks away.
“Nightlight” is the Lampoon’s spin on the awkward-girl-meets-dreamy-vampire series created by Stephanie Meyer that has taken the tween, teen, and even some of the adult market by storm.
Taking obvious to a whole new level, the character Edwart Mullen is based on Meyer’s Edward Cullen, who made pale skin, fangs and a thirst for blood sexy. Belle Goose, the new girl in “Nightlight” is similarly obviously based on Meyer’s Bella Swan. Just as the new names mirror the original, there are some pretty obvious parallels between the two plots.
The Bella in Twilight observes Edward’s inhuman characteristics—his lack of appetite, ability to save her from a swerving car, and stunning physical appearance—and concludes that he is a vampire. The Belle in Nightlight observes similar “inhuman” traits in Edwart and decides that he’s a vampire after he saves her from a snowball and (gasp!) does not finish his tater tots in the cafeteria.
PRAISE IS HUMOR
“Nightlight” isn’t the Lampoon’s first attempt at longer length parodies. Back in 1969, they transformed J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” into the shorter, more comical “Bored of the Rings.” When asked what inspired the writers to create “Nightlight,” they revealed that for over a year and half now, they have enjoyed “Twilight” and to the point of deciding to create their own version.
However, despite the satire, Nathaniel H. Stein ’10 reveals that they don’t dislike or bash “Twilight.”
“We’re all into ‘Twilight’ and think it’s a worthwhile literary achievement.” In fact, he says, “Our praise is humor. It’s our language.”
HUMOR IS WORK
Writing the “Twilight” parody took a lot more than imagination. Before they could start writing the book, the writers spent time researching the book, the characters, and Meyer herself.
Writers had to reread “Twilight” and get a good grip on the material. Some even read the novel three times. They also had to take notes to discuss during editorial meetings.
The writers also investigated every aspect of the book, from the fantastical creatures to the novel’s setting of Forks to Bella’s backpack (yes, they looked at catalogs). “There’s no detail in the work that isn’t researched,” Stein says.
Lampoon President, Matthew K. Grzecki ’10, gave some insight into the extent of the Lampoon’s preparations. “Over the summer, John [B. Owen ’10] and I, we’d basically wake up every morning and go to Widener Library and go to the stacks and read about vampires,” he says. Beyond merely hitting the books, they also engaged in some practical research. A few members of the Lampoon made a trip to Forks in Washington and went on a tour. “We had to live ‘Twilight’ for a while,” Grzecki says.
They also researched Meyer’s background. Although unable to speak to Meyer herself, the Lampoon contacted some of her professors from her time at Brigham Young University. According to Owen, they learned that Meyer likes comedy and took some comedy classes—classes that will hopefully help her appreciate the Lampoon’s parody of her work.
After all of this research, the Lampoon wrote “Nightlight.” The writers used the “corpse” method, in which they sat at a table and went around saying one word at a time forming the story. After many, many hours of “corpsing” and some editing, the 160 page book was created.
HOPING FOR A HIT
As November 3 approaches, “Twilight” fans are getting ready to either love or hate the parody of their beloved Edward and Bella.
New York Times bestselling author and publicist for “Nightlight” Sloane B. Crosley is excited for the book’s release.  She calls the material “its own animal” and expects fans to love it. Although these books may not rank high in the world of literary genius, “When you’re reading something like ‘Twilight’, you sort of recognize how you’re being pleasantly manipulated, and you agree to go along with it,” Crosley says. “You make a deal: ‘Okay I’m not going to be reading Shakespeare now. I’m going to be reading this fast-paced salacious thing.’”
But will “Twilight” fans truly appreciate the satire? Thejal Srikumar ’13, whose favorite “Twilight” character is Alice Cullen, thinks “Nightlight” will be a hit. She says, although “some people might take [“Nightlight”] too seriously...the actual story itself isn’t supposed to be real in any way shape or form.” We’ll see in two weeks whether diehard fans agree.

Some advice for aspiring writers: if you anticipate your work being purchased en masse one day by the Houghton Library, have a mother who loves you. Or at least a mother like John Updike’s ’54, who compiles and binds your letters to be stored until the end of days.
These letters form part of the Houghton Library’s Oct. 7, 2009 acquisition of the John Updike archive, which comprises approximately 1,500 books and a host of his manuscripts.
Even though the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was president of a semi-secret Sorrento Square organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, FM still encourages you to take a look at the archive’s more striking pieces.
Included in the collection is a 1961 edition of the famous “Rabbit, Run”, edited for a 1964 reprint, in which the ever-meticulous Updike literally cut and pasted revised paragraphs into the margins and tucked them into the text. The Archive also offers proof that Updike was just another Harvard student, scrawling a less well-known moniker for the greatest English playwright—“Willie the Shake”—onto a copy of “The Tempest” for Professor Henry Levin’s Shakespeare course.
While the majority of the Archive features Updike’s books and manuscripts, some quirkier gems include his Harvard and honorary degrees, his two Pulitzers, his pens and pencils, and the golf cards on which he would jot down ideas.
Leslie A. Morris, the curator of modern books and manuscripts at Houghton Library, says the archive has exciting implication for Updike scholars, as news of two unpublished Updike novels, slated to come out in twenty years, have already been guaranteed to the Library for study. “There will be a lot of surprises, I’m sure,” she says.
Updike’s possessions in the current archive already make up 308 linear feet and will take an estimated two years to sort through. Now that’s a lot of Updike.

As Harvard students, we often find ourselves wandering the streets of Cambridge on Saturday nights bemoaning the lack of good parties and wishing there was something else to do besides attend another kegger in Mather or a rager at the Delphic. But now, with local restaurant Fire and Ice opening a new nightclub, you’ll now have one more option.
The as-of-yet unnamed nightclub, set to open in March of 2010, will be located directly on top of the Church Street restaurant. With the addition of the nightclub, Fire and Ice will stay open past usual dinner hours, with a staircase leading down to the restaurant from the nightclub to serve hungry customers.
Plans for the nightclub have been in the works for over a year now, and manager of Fire and Ice John Eller, says he couldn’t be more excited: “I can’t wait, I think the opening of the nightclub will be great for Fire and Ice. It’s going to be a very laid-back scene, there will even be pool tables.”
Melina Collin, a Fire and Ice employee, hopes that the new nightclub will not only attract students from Harvard, but also teenagers from the surrounding Cambridge area­; the nightclub will be an 18+ venue.
Emma Doyle, a local resident and restaurant customer, agreed. “I love Fire and Ice,” she said. “And I think it’s great that they’re expanding and doing something for the younger crowd here in Cambridge.”
The question remains, will Harvard students take advantage of the new social space, or will they be deterred by the underage crowd and stir-fry atmosphere?
As a frequent patron of Fire and Ice, Paul R. Pate ’12, is thrilled to learn about the restaurant’s new plans. “It sounds pretty cool to me,” he says. “If there are pool tables, I’ll be there. I love pool.”
So if you find yourself bored once again on a Saturday night in March, check out the new nightclub, but make sure you go with an empty stomach.

At the virtual gambling tables that support the strange world of online poker, the insiders have names for their prey. “Fishes,” they are called in the chat forums that accompany online games. And “donkeys.” Also, “suckers,” “muppets,” and “idiots.” By all accounts, “Darkhawk-2000” qualifies as none of these. But that didn’t keep him from losing $8,000 in a single sitting one fateful night in the summer of 2007.
In retrospect, he says, he probably should have known that it was time to quit once his bankroll had dwindled to $500. But at the time, playing it out seemed like a fine idea: lose it all or win everything back. The lights flashing from his computer screen, the adrenaline, and the late hour made the whole enterprise seem like a video game—with dollars as the points system. How simple it seemed. And yet, how perilous: his entire bank account gone in the time it takes most people to get a good night’s sleep.
Two years later, Darkhawk—a November degree candidate at Harvard—has gained back his losses and then some. In one year, he has bulked up his resources from $1,000 to $80,000. At one point, the number towered at $110,000. Most days, Darkhawk plays online poker from one to nine p.m. and often finds himself active on as many as 16 virtual “tables” at once. The life has its perks. He was due to party with Charles Barkley last year, winning two tickets to a bash hosted by the retired athlete as part of a grand-prize package in an online tournament. The loot also included airfare to Palm Springs and two tickets to watch a celebrity golf tournament. (He didn’t go, he says, only because his friends weren’t free to accompany him.) To Darkhawk, $8,000 dollars doesn’t seem like a lot of money anymore. “It’s all relative, I guess,” Darkhawk says.
“It’s definitely been a rollercoaster ride. You live and learn. There are mistakes I’ve made, but I’m okay with it,” he says. “I’m pretty proud of what I do.” But Darkhawk, who still lives at home, can’t really say the same for his parents. They’ve been nagging him to find a “real” job, and perhaps they have a point: “Let’s say you want to marry a girl. ‘What’s your job?’ ‘I’m a professional gambler.’ Like, c’mon.” Darkhawk requested his online moniker be used instead of his real name for this piece, expressing concern that his gambling activity could have ramifications for his impending graduation. He says that if he does find a good enough job, he’ll probably play poker on a more recreational level—but for the moment, the game is proving to be too lucrative to push into the realm of second options.
So what changed between that summer night of freewheeling gambling and his current success as an online player? When Darkhawk tries to explain the emotions he experienced when he saw $8,000 slip away, he struggles for words. The feeling was similar to what he imagines drugs must be like, he says finally. Something distilled, adrenaline-heavy, “scary,” even. He had messed with the wrong person, the wrong situation, the wrong set of “sharks.” For a moment in time, Darkhawk-2000 was a fish. The experience was a turning point, he says. The only way to redeem himself, he realized in the days after the fiasco, was to give the game the respect that it demanded.
You see, after that harrowing experience, Darkhawk didn’t quit the game. He vowed to play smarter. And he seems to have kept his promise.
THE MYTH OF GAMBLING
For hundreds of years, the most powerful voices in American society branded gambling a wicked sport—spittle in the face of the Protestant work ethic. Puritans drafted the first gambling regulations in the New World with self-satisfied relish. “If asked to name the greatest agencies of evil in the land,” declared one Methodist preacher from New Orleans in the late 19th century, “we would not have declared the giant evil until we had named the Louisiana State Lottery.” Preachers, the moral compasses of their day, took to the pulpit to rail against an activity in which whole pots of money hung on the whims of fortune. The hands of gamblers were unforgivably smooth, untouched by hard labor.
“When your gut tells you that it’s something to be stigmatized, it comes from somewhere—historically, it comes from gambling’s perceived threat on the moral order of the day,” says Bo J. Bernhard ’95, associate professor of sociology at the University of Las Vegas and director of gambling research. “You were supposed to gradually save up your money and put it away for a rainy day, but gambling comes along and promises something for nothing. You don’t have to save a penny a day. You don’t have to save all your life. You can win all of that tonight.”
It’s a guarantee that forms the very cornerstone of Las Vegas, an empire of gilded beauty. It’s a promise that has woven dramatic fantasies out of twinges of desire, and mind-numbing addictions out of vague curiosity. Do not doubt the mythological power of the instant win. The mere concept has been enough to provoke amateur card players into dreaming of the potentials and the possibilities, the becomings and the will-bes. No thinking, all intuition. No work, all play. This is the beauty of luck.
Take Chris Moneymaker. He may have had the name, but nobody—much less professional players—knew who he was a little less than a decade ago. Through a $39 buy-in satellite tournament online, the then-27-year-old accountant from Tennessee won a seat in the main event of the 2003 World Series of Poker, where he won the first prize of $2.5 million. The crowning of a regular Joe as World Champion had seismic effects: interest in poker spiked—a trend that has been dubbed the “Moneymaker Effect”—and hobbyists emerged from the woodwork as they realized that it was possible for the layman to overthrow the professional. The Davids rose up against the Goliaths. After all, they had luck on their side—and luck is the great leveler.
It’s an uncomfortable truth: in any one game, the worst player can beat the best player in the world. “That’s certainly one thing that makes poker sexy to the average guy,” says Matt Hawrilenko, a 27-year-old professional poker player who graduated from Princeton in 2004, where he worked in the dining halls for financial aid. “In any given day, you can beat the best. Or, certainly, in any given day, you can compete with the best. The average guy is never going to be in the NFL, but he can sit down and play with the best poker players.”
This luck-factor can detract from poker’s meritocratic sensibilities. But the fact remains that there are bad players. And then there are professionals whose faces make repeated appearances at the final table of World Series events. It’s dangerous, many professionals say, for people to play poker with the idea that luck will constantly provide an edge. More than three-quarters of all poker players are losing players (“There are a lot of people playing,” Darkhawk says. “A lot are bad”). In 2007, gambling industries—including card rooms, commercial casinos, and lotteries—grossed revenues of $92.3 billion. In other words, the streets of Vegas are paved with our losses.
William Jankowiak, anthropology professor at UNLV and former visiting professor at Harvard, is convinced of several things: most gamblers are liars, they usually remember their wins instead of their losses, and they don’t actually make much profit. In other words, compulsive gamblers have somehow convinced themselves that they are winning at an inherently losing game. “If you did all the calculations, you shouldn’t gamble. If you were really rationally put together, you wouldn’t gamble,” Jankowiak says. “There’s no way you can win over time.”
“It just doesn’t make sense to me on some level to be playing a game where you could be losing money,” adds Peter B. Gray, assistant professor in anthropology at UNLV. “On some level, I think I’m too rational.”
But while this may be true of compulsive gamblers, most professional players would argue that rationality constitutes the very foundation of their approach towards poker. Luck’s good side can push you towards a win, but professionals know that it’s not enough over the long run. They know that they need something more—and when they have it, they’re able to tame the game. That’s when luck is no longer in control. They are.
MAN OF SCIENCE, MAN OF MATH
Sitting in Dunster House on a recent evening, “Ian” is fidgety, shaking his legs and darting his fingers after a pen on a nearby desk before picking it up to twirl it into a plastic blur. He looks like a nervous student—not the stony-limbed picture of calm so familiar from televised poker tournaments. And yet Ian, who works with a student group at Harvard and requested that his real name not be used for this piece, is very much a poker player—a professional online, who says he has not gone to bed until nine this morning after a marathon game.
It’s quickly apparent that Ian brings a cerebral bent to his work. He actively seeks and hoards information, isolating and then coddling a nugget of curiosity until it blossoms into a sprawling research project. A few years ago, Ian decided he needed to understand economics, so he bought a batch of textbooks off of Amazon and EBay to work through. Most days, he says, he puts in an hour or so on Wikipedia. On a recent October afternoon, “William III of England” is open on his computer—just to look into some English history, he says. The accumulation of knowledge is like the gathering of currency: it works to your favor to have more. In Ian’s mind, college is wasted on most students because they don’t realize just how good they have it. He’s considered going back to grad school, but why should he commit seven years of his life to one academic discipline?
Ian, who graduated from a public university in the late ’90s, taught high school students for a few years, but soon realized he had no patience for kids who thought they were smarter and more hard-working than they actually were, and the “helicopter parents” who agreed. They should have all tried Math 55, Ian insists, referring to the legendary Harvard course catering to first-year math geniuses. During these frustrating years teaching, Ian played poker on the side.
“That was when I realized that, as a hobby or a part-time job, I was making far more per hour gambling than I was teaching,” Ian says, in his own version of a stock statement among professional gamblers. Disgruntled, under-appreciated—and then bewildered, struck by the clarity of the situation like Saul encountering the Lord: it’s a trajectory many working gamblers describe when they recount their transition from what some may call a “normal” life to a more alternative one. After five years teaching, Ian switched to online poker as his primary means of making money.
“My mom regularly lies about my occupation,” Ian says. “She says I’m still a teacher.”
In fact, Ian makes about as much as he did when he was teaching—around $50,000 a year. But there’s certainly a great deal less stress than before. The self-professed “night owl” likes that he can stay up until five a.m. and sleep in until noon. Ian suffers from mild carpal-tunnel syndrome, but that doesn’t stop him from playing five or six days a week, occasionally eight hours in a day. He usually has no more than 10 tables open (He has a friend with ADHD who juggles 24).
“The innumeracy of Americans really makes this possible,” Ian says about his poker profession. The “over-inflated self-esteem” of the country, combined with the seeming “disdain for math,” has made the environment opportune for learned players like himself, Ian says. More than 75 percent of players are losers, and, according to Ian, less than 10 percent of players play mathematically—in essence, fundamental mistakes that can be eliminated with simple instruction pervade the amateur scene. “Most people don’t read books, as far as I can tell,” he muses. If Ian were to give a relatively intelligent beginner a book to read over the weekend and hold a couple one-on-one sessions, he says, the student would be a winning player at the lowest limits, guaranteed.
“I’m not a very good poker player, given the people I know. But the thing is, at the hobbyist level, people make such hideous mistakes because they’ll do something like, ‘I feel lucky,’ or they think they have a read on someone when they really don’t,” Ian says. “They’re going to see someone like Phil Ivey [commonly known as the Tiger Woods of Poker] do certain things, not realizing that there might be 50 hands before, leading up to what he’s doing. But they just see this one hand and go,’I can do that.’ And they can’t.”
As the saying goes, the next best thing to gambling and winning, is gambling and losing—and that bodes well for professionals. Forget skill and luck—all you have to make sure is that you’re better than the next guy, and the multitudes that have flocked to online poker in recent years have ensured that there is a consistent crop of bad players. One of Ian’s friends said he liked gambling because he is “surrounded by inept people, yet none of them are his boss, and if they do something dumb, it makes him money as opposed to a mess for him to clean up.”
During the times he is not actively playing poker, Ian examines statistical records of his hands online to gauge which hands are leaking money and where he’s going wrong. He keeps tabs on other players for play tendencies to qualify his future decisions with that information. For all the conceptions of poker as a sport of luck, most professionals emphasize the importance of decision-making in the game. “Do I fold, do I raise, or do I call? Whoever makes better decisions wins over the long run,” Darkhawk says. “You’re always executing decisions, and you’re trying to make profitable decisions every time.”
“I always try to be very critical and keep the lookout…‘Okay, I lost money—did I put myself in a bad situation, or did I just lose money?’ ‘Okay, I won money—did I put myself in a good situation, or did I just get lucky?’ These are questions I ask myself everyday,” says Hawrilenko, one of the world’s best heads-up limit hold’em players. “People don’t do a very good job of being honest or applying any sort of intellectual rigor to try to figure out if I’m doing good or bad—and that’s a big leak in a lot of gambling.”
Hawrilenko, who now lives in Back Bay, describes his overarching perspective on poker as a “game tree.” Every time he or one of his poker friends chooses an action—whether to raise, fold, or call—he’s taking a different branch of the tree, which is composed of all the possible moves and all the possible ends. As you move up the tree, it narrows down to what is called your distribution, or the hands you can possibly hold. Professionals, Hawrilenko says, try to maximize the value of their distributions and balance the best possible hands with both good and bad hands. But even those with the heaviest intellectual machinery and the most rational approach can still be vulnerable.
In other words, don’t try real gambling if you’re not ready to possibly do it wrong and suffer the consequences. “For the majority of Americans, I’d say the best advice would be play for play money,” Ian says.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF LUCK
According to Bernhard, the UNLV sociology professor, gambling constitutes any activity in which valuable items are wagered with no guarantee of the outcome. The description sounds a lot like poker—every hand has a good or bad outcome. It’s the mere possibility of the former, coupled with the ease with which it can happen, that draws legions to the game. But many experienced poker players chafe at the use of the term “gambling,” wincing as soon it’s mentioned and politely interrupting to clarify the distinction between gambling and card playing—well, at least their form of play.
“I don’t think poker is gambling,” Darkhawk says. “Everything I’m doing, I know and have calculated—not completely, exactly. But over the long run, I’m going to make money.” A skilled poker player will have reduced his risk until he is confident of the results of his game, according to Darkhawk. With all its connotations of irrational risk-taking and unpredictable outcomes, gambling is no longer an applicable term when the game of poker has a firm foundation in analytics and intellect. Yes, one can never determine the outcome with complete certainty, but the game is no longer a crapshoot. In fact, Darkhawk says, the odds will be in his favor over the long run.
Say a friend offers you a deal in which for every coin flip that ends in heads, he gives you $11, and for every tails, you give him $10 dollars. If you had $1,000 in your bankroll, you would be foolish not to take up the deal. The first 10 tosses might not generate any heads, leaving you $100 down—but in the larger scope of things, in a world attuned to the rules of probability, you will leave the game having gained a profit. But now, say the stakes are upped and instead of $11, your friend has to give you $110, and instead of $10, you have to give him $100. You could wipe out your entire coffer after 10 coin tosses. The idea is similar for smart poker-playing: the trick is to play at levels at which you have a negligible risk of going broke, but you’re still able to make a significant profit.
Hawrilenko doesn’t make as clear a distinction between gambling and professional poker playing, but he says that he has greatly diminished the risk factor associated with compulsive gambling. “A lot of times, when people think ‘gambling,’ they think ‘gambling your savings away,’ or playing with money you can’t afford to lose. My cousin asked me the other day, ‘So, can you sit down at the table and lose your house?’ It’s a legitimate question, but it’s taken a while to explain to my parents that if you do it properly, it’s a lot like managing your portfolios. Could you lose everything you own in the stock market? Sure you could. But you can balance your portfolio such that essentially, your risk of ruin is zero.”
Hawrilenko—who used to work in finance but now makes his living playing online poker—says that after he had played a large number of hands, he ran different kinds of win-rate analyses and determined that his chance of going bust was “pretty much zero,” which meant that he would win in the long run. And it’s safe to say that he has: at the 2009 World Series, Hawrilenko won more than a million dollars when he came in first place at an event. He took $100,688 at yet another one. But these are just incidental wins in a longer stream of acquisitions.
For his part, Darkhawk tries to diminish his chance of disaster with a simple rule: his bankroll should be at least 100 times the buy-in for a given game, to ensure that the game’s variance won’t leave him broke.
“In a lot of ways, it’s harder to be a professional gambler than to work on Wall Street because on Wall Street, you’re really screwing around with other people’s money,” Ian says. “To be blunt, a lot of them really don’t have enough of their own skin in the game.” Though some poker players might be capable of beating a bigger game, they don’t move into higher stakes because they know that their bankroll can’t withstand the variants, he says. One of the biggest mistakes a novice player can make is to be too bold, too early. “If you’re a gambler and you do something really, really dumb, and you wipe out the bankroll, you’ve just wiped out your means of making money.”
But losing—and a tolerance for losing—is also an essential aspect of successful play. Players at all skill levels will have both winning days and losing days. It’s the interpretation of these events that can make all the difference and constitute divergent perspectives on the game. As a general rule, wins on individual hands cannot be interpreted as indications of future success. Novices often fall into the trap of thinking that they are performing well when they make money on a particular hand. They focus on the intermittent rewards, rising and falling with each incremental shift in their fortunes. But for the professionals, it’s only the wide-lens view that matters. It’s the difference between magnifying a single dip or rise in the Dow Jones and seeing it from a few feet away as a simple hiccup in a concerted (and, for the expert poker player, orchestrated) upward trend. You’re not really a gambler until you’ve gone broke and made it back. “Losing is normal. You’re supposed to lose,” Darkhawk says. “Winning has to be detached from how well you’re playing.”
Case in point: In Hawrilenko’s worst month, he stepped up to a bigger play and lost about a million dollars. “That hurt,” he recalls. But the month before, he had won $700,000. And the month following also proved fruitful. Hawrilenko never totally depleted his bankroll that year—a “great year,” in fact. A seasoned player, Hawrilenko had the funds, the temperament, and the knowledge to buffer the loss of even a million dollars. In the long run, he knew, it was just a bump in the road to the top.
It’s a determinist attitude with an interesting corollary. Novice players are known for chasing the rush of big swings, not understanding that professionals purposely buffer their losses with their bankrolls. They’ll swing $500 in a day to feel the adrenaline, lose the rush the week after, and bump it to $1000, looking to find the thrill again. For one Harvard undergrad who usually plays a couple hours of online poker a day, his approach to the game differs substantially from that of a professional. Upon the encouragement of his roommate, an experienced player, the individual began playing online his freshman fall and soon found the game “addicting.” The most he’s won in a sitting is $650—but in total, he’s $200 down the hole. “There are times when I get pretty into it. Whenever I get a bad beat, it’s pretty tough to take,” says the individual, who requested to remain anonymous for legal issues. “There’s some yelling that goes on.”
Taken to a more extreme level, it’s a pattern of behavior that calls to mind the drug-user analogy that Darkhawk made as he searched for a way to describe the night he lost it all, a mindset that he associates, pointedly, with “gambling” and not poker-playing. For the pros, the Hawrilenkos and Darkhawks of the world, riding a long smooth curve of expected value and carefully weighed percentages, the adrenaline rush is largely a thing of the past.
“I don’t sit down at the poker table, and I don’t really feel that rush,” Hawrilenko says. “I find that the more logical you are, the more you try to analyze every situation, and the more you can kind of see the big picture and the long view, the less it feels like gambling.” In fact, some days, Hawrilenko just doesn’t want to play—but he has to, he says, because it supports his very livelihood.
“It’s something which is very counter-intuitive to a lot of people,” Ian says. “I laugh when people are like, ‘It’s so risky!’ Do you have money in the stock market, or do you have money in a hedge fund? Here, at least I’m more or less betting on my assessment of myself rather than handing my money over to somebody else.”
THE FAST LIFE OF A GAMBLER
A reserved, introverted man who speaks softly with a slight lisp, Hawrilenko won a large tournament at the World Series in Vegas this past summer and was swiftly reminded just how unevenly his own lifestyle matches up with the stereotype of the poker champion. “People were asking me, ‘So how are you going to celebrate it? Are you going out to get booze and strippers?!’” Hawrilenko recalls. “Most of my housemates don’t really drink that much, and I don’t really drink and party that much in Vegas. We celebrated at 2 a.m. by going to the Tropical Smoothie Café.”
Hawrilenko says that there are plenty of low-key intellectual players like himself, but the flamboyant, self-described “high rollers” tend to get more camera time, fueling a media image of a scene of excess, debauchery, and ballooning egos. “My friends and I, we laugh at these guys. They have their bling and their backwards hat”—Hawrilenko makes the vigorous motion of pulling an invisible hat back—“and their sunglasses on”—he puts on a pair of shades. “These guys are so cocky that they can’t possibly be good. If you can’t consider the fact that other people have brains, too, how can you play at a high level? You can’t.”
But there’s something to be said about the lure of the game—not only in the monetary rewards that its most skilled players can reap over time, but also the sheer thrill of engaging in an environment often depicted as risqué and fast-paced, a break from the mundane nine-to-five job. As UNLV professor Peter Gray observes, many players derive their enjoyment from adopting a new persona for a limited time—the incognito nature of an online poker table, the stoicism needed at a live game, or the chance to escape for a weekend to an exotic island.
In the past, Darkhawk has tried to win the “Aruba Poker Classic” package, which includes airfare and a week-stay at a hotel, all advertised with the help of scantily clad females. “I was kinda close,” Darkhawk says. “I was getting really excited. It’s not like going to a poker tournament—it’s like a vacation.” He says the “Caribbean Poker Adventure” sounded pretty good, too. For many professionals, such luxuries are close realities proffered by the world of gambling.
And when you’ve played the game well enough so that it’s no longer playing you, it’s a hard offer to resist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
Cambridge police are looking for three unidentified men accused of stabbing a 38-year-old Somerville man multiple times on JFK Street outside of CVS early Saturday morning, according to a Cambridge police report.
The victim, whose name is redacted from the report, told police that three black males, all between 19 and 21 years of age, attacked him. The report called the case an “attempted murder.”
The victim took a cab to Cambridge City Hospital, then proceeded to walk into the hospital at 12:39 a.m. Saturday morning, according to the report.
Police were dispatched to the hospital. When they arrived, they spoke with the attending physician who informed them the victim had seven different wounds—in the abdomen, chest, leg, and pelvis—that had been inflicted by an edged weapon, according to the report.
The victim lost a “great deal” of blood. Much of the blood-saturated clothing the victim wore to the hospital was taken for evidence, according to the report. The victim received a CAT scan at the hospital.
The victim was later transported to Massachusetts General Hospital.
Hospital officials released the victim yesterday, according to the Cambridge police.
A CVS employee, who would not give his name to The Crimson, said yesterday in an interview outside of CVS that he had been working the night of the stabbing.
“I heard it and I came outside,” he said. “I heard some yelling, sounded like a fight.”
CVS—located at 29 JFK St.—was closed at the time. He said that while he did not see the alleged fight, a homeless man was outside at the time and witnessed the incident.
Police also interviewed the bartender working at Whitney’s Cafe, a bar near where the alleged incident took place, according to Scott Baron, another Whitney’s Cafe bartender.
Baron said the bartender told the police that he did not know what happened.
As the investigation is still ongoing, police are not releasing information on the case outside of the police report, according to Alexa Manocchio, a Cambridge police public information officer.

Sara Greenbaum—the Clinton Climate Initiative’s chief strategy officer—outlined her organization’s work over the past three years at a talk yesterday, while acknowledging that combatting climate change will require more efforts to come.
Greenbaum acknowledged that the group “threw a lot of balls in the air three years ago” and is now evaluating which projects have been the most successful in implementing significant change.
She outlined three major prongs of their effort—increasing urban energy efficiency, augmenting the clean energy supply, and curbing deforestation.
She said that unlike other environmental groups, which focus on issues such as education and advocacy, the Clinton Climate Initiative aims to bring together different stakeholders—such as businesses and technological innovators—to form partnerships and develop strategies to engage and mobilize governments.
“We are basically the dealmakers,” Greenbaum said at the Boylston Hall talk.
Gabriel J. Daly ’10—co-president of the Harvard College Council on Business and the Environment, which organized the talk, and an inactive Crimson News writer—said that the Clinton Climate Initiative has been “uniquely innovative in trying to be technologically agnostic”—that is, by not dogmatically viewing one form of technology as the sole solution to climate change.
Greenbaum highlighted the Clinton Climate Initiative’s work on a large waste project in Delhi as an example of the group carrying out a technology analysis, coming up with a business plan, and bringing in different “operators” and technology suppliers to implement their plan.
“Has the broad global focus of the initiative improved or made more difficult the efficacy of the issue?” Daly asked in a question and answer session after the talk, referring to the large range of projects that the Clinton Climate Initiative is involved in.
Acknowledging the difficulty of standardizing projects, Greenbaum said that the Initiative is now trying to develop frameworks that will be more replicable across the world.

Palestinian peace activist Dr. Izzeldin M. Abuelaish said yesterday that Israelis and Palestinians must communicate with each other to lay the groundwork for a lasting peace.
Abuelaish—a Harvard School of Public Health graduate and 2010 Nobel Peace Prize nominee—argued for the importance of open dialogue through the lens of his experiences as a doctor and peace activist in both Israel and the Palestinian territories.
“Understanding and communicating with each other is the most important,” Abuelaish told the group of Muslim, Jewish, Arab, and Palestinian undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard Hillel. “Our problem is lack of communication. We must listen and deal with each other, and realize in the end that others are similar to you.”
He described his experiences as a peace activist, a doctor in Israel and the Palestinian territories, and a father who has lost three of his daughters to Israeli tank shells that shattered his home in Gaza in January.
Today’s youth, such as students at Harvard, bear the burden of finding the path toward peaceful co-existence, Abuelaish said. He added that students in America and abroad should make themselves knowledgeable about the current conflicts in the Middle East and take action in order to make a difference.
Abuelaish said that in honor of his three daughters, he believes it is time for women to take the lead in the path toward peace. He added that he is currently creating a foundation to provide access to education and healthcare to women and girls in the Gaza Strip and the rest of the Middle East.
“We have to speak with honesty, with openness, to put everything on the table,” Abuelaish said at the invitation-only event. “There is a window of opportunity here for us to be creative, to be honest, and to be human [so as to] find a way to live in collaboration—in peace—so that dignities of both [Palestinians and Israelis] are equal.”
Fathima F. Jahufar ’11, an Islamic Society officer, said that she found the talk to be thought-provoking.
“He brings up a lot of ideas that aren’t openly discussed—like very basic values such as common humanity that we learn but sort of forget over time,” she said.
Abuelaish received a masters in public health from Harvard in 2004. His visit to Harvard Hillel was sponsored by the Chicago-based Brit Tzedek v’Shalom—the Jewish Alliance for Justice and Peace.

Whereas many see unfair or poorly implemented legislation as a problem endemic of developing nations, Dr. Ann Seidman and Dr. Robert B. Seidman ’41 argued in a discussion Tuesday night that laws can be the springboard for solutions.
In a small interactive session, the Seidmans, who direct the International Consortium for Law and Development, related their decades of experience in twelve African nations. The talk, hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee, also focused on how legislation can spark change in developing nations.
“You can’t simply pass a law telling the resources to go from the wealthy to the local population,” said Robert Seidman said, who, like his wife, is a professor at Boston University Law School. “Although Non-Governmental Organizations and education can facilitate improvement as well, the state is the nation’s largest employer in most of the nations in which we’ve worked,” he said. “Legislation is the clear way to enhance and solidify these changes.”
The Consortium, which the Seidmans founded in 1981, is a non-profit organization that promotes participatory lawmaking in developing countries. It brings together ministry officials and university professors representing over 40 nations with varying legal structures.
Ann Seidman, who is planning another trip to Tanzania this winter, echoed her husband’s emphasis on starting improvement from the state and working outward to improve other institutions.
“There’s a major amount of behavioral changes that individuals have to respond to when you set up schools, and you can’t expect such a change to just happen,” she said. “The best steps include identifying the behaviors that lead to lower prosperity, getting a legislative solution, and closely monitoring and evaluating the results.”
The discussion closed with the Seidmans discussing pragmatic measures for determining a bill’s effectiveness.
“We say that a bill works if it actually induces the behavior it prescribes and if that effectively helps resolve the targeted social problem,” Robert Seidman said.
Pierre R. Berastain ’10-11, a member of the Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee, said he appreciated hearing an unconventional view on international development.
“We were really thrilled that Robert and Ann Seidman were able to visit with us and share their insights,” Berastain said.

Harvard University Health Services has stopped giving seasonal flu vaccines at its Holyoke Center headquarters and most other sites around the University, due to an unexpected shortage.
Most of Harvard’s graduate schools—including the Law School, the Business School, the Graduate School of Education, and the School of Public Health—have stopped administering seasonal flu vaccines earlier than expected because a shipment of 1,600 flu vaccines expected two days ago did not arrive, according to UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59.
UHS will hold final clinics for undergraduates tonight in Currier dining hall and next Wednesday in Eliot.
“Students, faculty and staff who still wish to receive a seasonal flu vaccine should check with their local pharmacies, which have also been administering flu shots and may still have supplies,” Rosenthal wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson.
UHS ordered about 19,000 doses this year, according to Rosenthal, and  has administered between 15,000 and 16,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine since early September—at least 25 percent more than the approximately 12,000 doses given out last year.
A clinic planned yesterday at the Law School was canceled at the last minute, according to Dorothy Wilder, a UHS nurse at Harvard Law School. Like most other graduate schools, the Law School will not receive any more seasonal flu vaccine.
Approximately 700 people received seasonal flu vaccinations on Tuesday at the Holyoke Center—the last clinic to be offered to the University community at UHS.
Before the shortage, UHS officials were planning on ending their seasonal flu vaccination program in the next two weeks to focus on the H1N1 vaccine, which has also seen delays.
Rosenthal said that at the beginning of the school year that he was hoping to receive shipments of H1N1 vaccine in mid-October, but that he now anticipates waiting until the beginning or middle of November.
“There are still issues out there about where it is. Where is the H1N1 vaccine?” Rosenthal said. “Fortunately, the illness is still mild to moderate.”
UHS has ordered between 12,000 and 13,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, but the first shipment will be earmarked for groups designated high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—including pregnant women, medical services personnel, and caretakers of young children.
UHS has a list of about 300 to 400 people at Harvard who qualify as high-risk and will receive the vaccine when it first arrives.

David Axelrod, Senior Advisor to President Obama and chief strategist of his 2008 presidential campaign, spoke last night at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, reflecting on his experiences in the Obama administration during its first ten months in office.
Responding to questions posed by Abby D. Phillip ’10, who is a current Crimson news executive, and Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10, Axelrod discussed the behind-the-scenes aspects of his work with the president. He emphasized he finds working at the White House, despite its hectic and challenging nature, extremely enjoyable—largely due to the atmosphere created by Obama.
“The character of this White House, and every White House, in certain ways, reflects the character of the person who sits in the Oval Office,” said Axelrod.
Although he spoke of being inspired by politicians who are there for “the right reasons,” Axelrod also expressed his disappointment at the lack of bipartisan cooperation in Congress.
“I think Americans want a strong two-party system and want to see the loyal opposition challenge the assumptions and ideas of the party in power,” said Axelrod. “But they want it done in a constructive way, and sometimes, in the last ten months, we haven’t seen that.”
In response to a student question, Axelrod explained the administration’s attempts to combat the danger of falling out of touch with the average American.
“We try to get out, try to read those letters, try to talk to people every day outside of DC,” said Axelrod. “Sadly, the black arts of polling and focus groups become useful because they give you the chance to hear what people are saying in other places. It is a big challenge.”
Audience member Michael T. Galli ’13 said the glimpse into Obama’s White House was refreshing. “Sometimes we forget why we are here at Harvard getting this education, so hearing Axelrod’s perspectives was very invigorating,” said Galli.
Axelrod echoed a sentiment familiar to many students when describing his daily routine.
“Sleep is not a commodity that is easily acquired in Washington,” he said. “So I just drink these Diet Cokes.”

Harvard is testing new emergency notification protocols on 20,000 users today in an assessment of its “MessageMe” system, which experienced functionality problems during the Kirkland House shooting incident last spring.
The program, which was introduced at the University in the wake of the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, came under scrutiny for failing to deliver messages properly—or at all—during the Harvard shooting. Text messages were cut short and about two percent of the 14,000 subscribers in the program were not reached during the incident, University spokesman Kevin Galvin wrote in an e-mailed statement at the time.
University Information Systems, which oversees the program, has since trained representatives from the Harvard News Office and Harvard University Police Department to avoid truncation problems. Standard SMS messages have a limit of 160 characters.
“Folks go in, they use the system, they practice sending a message, sending a message to a specific group,” said Susan Walsh, the acting Chief Information Officer at the University Information Systems. She added that students who choose not to receive emergency text messages can now also be alerted to emergencies through e-mails, Twitter, Facebook “fan pages,” and RSS feeds.
“We’re trying to reach out with as many different modes of communication as we can,” said Walsh. “We’re going for saturation.”
Undergraduate Council member George Hayward ’11 noted that the delivery of some text messages during the Kirkland shooting had been delayed—possibly because alerts had been sent to all subscribers at once, overloading the system.
Hayward cited the failed messages deliveries in his lobbying efforts to improve cell phone reception in the Quad, and he noted that the “MessageMe” program is explicitly cited by the University in its reaccreditation report as one reason why Harvard is a “particularly secure school.”

The unemployment rate in Massachusetts rose to 9.3 percent for the month of September, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development announced Tuesday. The statewide unemployment rate was 5.6 percent last September. The national unemployment rate for September 2009 is 9.8 percent.
According to a press release from the EOLWD, unemployment rates rose in all areas of Massachusetts—including in Cambridge, which increased from 4.0 percent last September to 6.6 percent this September.
Linda C. Rohrer, director of Career Source, a career resource center based in Cambridge, said the rate is “not as devastating as it appears.”
Rohrer added that in the last few months, the number of unemployed people coming to the center seeking jobs has levelled off.
“Last November through February it was insanity, with thirty or forty people lining out the door every morning before we opened,” Rohrer said. “Now we open the doors and there may be just one person waiting.”
Executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson said that Cambridge’s 2.6 percent increase in unemployment is not likely attributable to Square businesses.
“I’m sure there’s some turnover in terms of employees,” Jillson said. “Though in this past year, we’ve only seen a couple of major closings, so things are relatively steady.”
Jillson said she has heard reports that national chains, which constitute around 15 percent of the Business Association, have been struggling much more than smaller, locally-owned shops.
“These locally-owned independents don’t have to go all the way up the ladder to get an answer to change something,” she said. “They can react more quickly to a shifting economy in how to cut back hours, how to hire, than the larger chain stores can.”
“I don’t think we really need to target [Harvard Square],” Rohrer said. “There are a lot of retail stores there, and in that area people naturally come and go, are hired and laid off.”
Rohrer said people who used the career center have been hired at highest rates in health care, government, and professional and technical services such as information technology or biotechnology.
She also said the effect of universities and hospitals on the unemployment rate in Cambridge and the surrounding area is greater than that of the retail industry.
According to the press release from EOLWD, the number of job openings in the education and health service fields have increased in past year. More seasonally-dependent areas such as hospitality, transportation, trade, and construction have recorded the largest declines in job openings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Massachusetts Port Authority fell into chaos as revenue plummeted across the board. Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, then finance director of the MPA, lost no time in responding. She quickly organized four task forces and got the authority back on firm financial footing within nine months, according to MPA aviation finance director Brian R. McMorrow.
It’s this prowess in fiscal management that drew Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith to Kirwan—in an e-mailed statement last month, he cited Kirwan’s “history of building and leading strong administrative organizations” as a strength she will bring to her new post as Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean for Administration and Finance.
“She’s a highly competent, highly numerate, extremely skilled individual who has both good budgetary sense and good political judgement,” said Economics Professor James H. Stock, who serves on the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors and worked with Kirwan in quantitative modeling and forecasting of revenues.
Armed with what colleagues call an exemplary leadership style marked by candidness and team-building, Kirwan will move into University Hall as FAS finance dean in early November, fresh from her stint as the State of Massachusetts’ head finance official under Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78. Kirwan comes on the heels of sweeping budget cuts across the FAS, which faces a remaining deficit of $110 million.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, Kirwan shied away from making definitive statements on how she plans to close the FAS deficit, emphasizing the need to meet with relevant constituents before professing any grand designs.
“I’m going to be very careful as I arrive at Harvard not to have any preconceived notions about how I would recommend changes be made,” she said. “It’s going to be really important for me to do a lot of listening to Dean Smith, to the faculty—who are the heart and soul of FAS—and other stakeholders.”
And building a team environment, colleagues say, is exactly what Kirwan is known for.
“She is the perfect hire for Harvard, and Harvard is the perfect job for her. This is a terrific fit,” said Betsy Taylor, MPA director of finance and treasury, who spent nine years directly reporting to Kirwan. “Everyone says that Harvard does everything by committee—and that’s her style.”
NOT A LONE LEADER
No one individual is ever completely given the reins on administrative decisions in state governance, and the structure of committees and groups is a frustrating setup for some, Taylor said. But Kirwan is a natural consensus-builder and most at ease when she is working in a group setting, according to several state government colleagues.
“She wants to know what’s important to the people around her, both in a profound way and in a more social way,” Taylor said. “She can deal with both very serious issues—professionally and personally—and she is really in touch with the little things, the funny things, the silly things that make people who they are.”
As the chair of the Health Insurance Connector Authority Board for the past couple of years, Kirwan was described as a good listener with even-handed judgement who consistently steered the board to unanimous votes, according to board member Celia A. Wcislo.
Though Kirwan has had to close $7 billion in budget deficits during her two-year tenure, healthcare board member and Harvard School of Public Health lecturer Nancy Turnbull described Kirwan as “very creative” in collaborating with others to try to sustain the healthcare coverage expansions made in Mass.
But Kirwan is no yes-woman. She said she believes in frank communication, even if the news may be less than pleasant for its recipients. Even more importantly, Kirwan stressed that it is often incumbent on leaders to acknowledge that they do not know something instead of resorting to silence.
“Leslie [Kirwan] could not be less like a bull in a china shop, and yet she is capable of being very direct, and that is a very unusual combination,” Taylor said. “She makes people cope with whatever needs to be dealt with. She will not hide the problem, and she will not sugar-coat it. She’ll deal with them.”
Kennedy School Professor Herman  B. “Dutch” Leonard, who taught Kirwan while she was at the Kennedy School, said that he expects Kirwan to be a more transparent administrator than most at Harvard, noting that she turned the state budget into a much less cryptic public document when she took over as finance secretary.
“I think Leslie’s inclinations in general would be to say that an understandable accounting is better for some of the players than a cryptic and difficult-to-understand presentation,” Leonard said.
CUTTING THE RIGHT WAY
A glance at Kirwan’s resume reveals extensive experience in the fiscal management of large organizations. As the state’s secretary of administration and finance, Kirwan helped close a series of billion-dollar deficits and developed the state capital budget. Prior to her time in the State House, Kirwan also worked for the MPA and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.
“She has built a career moving in a fairly logical progression within that domain, developing greater experience the whole way,” Leonard said.
“I have a long list of questions that come from my own experience of how budgets have been constructed in agencies I have worked in—there are going to be Harvard flavors of all of those things,” Kirwan said. “I’m sure there are many analogies I’ll find in the Harvard FAS budget.”
FAS may be uncharted professional terrain for someone familiar with working for state organizations, but Kirwan is no stranger to Harvard. Kirwan, who grew up in Cambridge “in the shadow of the University” was a student not only of the College but at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Her FAS appointment, Kirwan said, is the perfect opportunity to help her alma mater as it undergoes tough fiscal times, and to use the management skills she has bolstered through her various government positions in the past. The FAS deanship was “too good a chance to pass up,” Kirwan said.
Though Kirwan declined to comment on her plans regarding the FAS budget, she said the top priorities and missions of the University would serve as benchmarks as she makes administrative decisions in the future.
“We have to look always to preserve the essence of what makes Harvard the university that it is,” Kirwan said. “What are the core missions, core services of the organization you work for? It’s important to keep those in the forefront of your mind as you’re planning what cuts you can make.”
The longer the downturn continues, however, the more likely it will become that cutbacks will “really dismantle things that we still need to be in the business of doing,” Kirwan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Carr Center for Human Rights Policy commemorated its 10th anniversary last night at the IOP in a forum highlighting the progress the institution has made over the past decade.
The event, entitled ‘Why Human Rights Matter,’ showcased a speech by the Center’s founder, Gregory C. Carr, in addition to a discussion between Kennedy School Professor Samantha Power and Kennedy School Lecturer Sarah Sewall, two prominent leaders in the human rights movement.
The discussion was moderated by Kennedy School Professor Rory Stewart and centered around the Carr Center’s role in shaping human rights policy and the minds of students.
Carr opened the forum with an explanation of his motives in founding the Center, saying that Gandhi’s belief that humans should give back to their communities inspired him to establish the Center.
The discussion shifted to Power, who described the common thread that unites those working and studying at the Carr Center.
“Impatience,” said Power, “is what drives the people here to get things done. In human rights, there is an evidence-based result.”
Sewall agreed, adding that the focus of human rights work should be on impact.
She also said that because human rights was “set back” by the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the definition and rhetoric of human rights should be approached with greater nuance.
Sewall also discussed the appropriate use of power in the implementation of human rights.
“Sometimes, a forceful approach will be justified, as in the case of the Bosnia human rights interventions. However, it is a complicated formula to think about what human rights are and how the rhetoric of human rights is used.”
In a question and answer session, Jake Sloane ’12 asked the speakers to highlight the most notable achievement of the Carr Center since its creation.
Stewart referenced the important role the Carr Center played in addressing the human rights violations in Bosnia.
“The center should be very proud of its impatience for action,” he said. “Crime rates in Bosnia are now lower than they are in Sweden. 230,000 Bosnian refugees returned to their homes in a year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The early bird catches the worm, right?
That’s what the Stanford Cardinal thought back in June. Six days ago, the adage was proven false–in Harvard’s favor.
Tight end Blake Barker, the top high school football recruit in Massachusetts, decommitted from the Palo Alto, Calif. school on Oct. 16 and verbally declared his allegiance to the Crimson ranks.
Harvard might not have been the early bird, but the addition of the Rivals.com No. 9-ranked tight end in the country is something to sing about.
“[With Barker] coming with the kind of reputation like that from the scouting, that obviously bodes well for what he’ll do here,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “You can never tell anything until you really throw on the pads, but he looks like a great player.”
At 6’6 and 235 lbs., Barker will provide a physical force on offense—a Scout.com report listed his size and blocking capabilities as noteworthy strengths.  Although he might be poised to wreak havoc amongst Ancient Eight defenses next year for these reasons, Barker may never receive a touchdown pass—the Crimson coaching staff might very well make use of his equally qualified skills on the defensive line, where Barker has a knack for getting at enemy field generals.
In addition to recording 450 receiving yards and six touchdown receptions, Barker made 12.5 sacks last year as a junior in the ISL, one of New England’s most competitive high school leagues.
The year before, the tight end racked up 189 yards, seven scores and 4.5 sacks in his first year on the varsity squad of his high school, Buckingham Browne and Nichols (BB&N).
Speaking about his eventual position on the Crimson, Barker simply expressed the urge to get on the field.
“I’m happy either way,” he commented.
Aside from Stanford, other schools that pursued the top prospect included Florida, Penn State, Boston College and UVA.
“For him to turn down an offer from a school like Stanford bodes well for Harvard and how well we recruit,” Ehrlich said.
The switch came as a surprise to most of the college football world, a community in which dozens of websites associated Barker’s mug with a redwood tree.
“After [the original decision] happened and all the recruiting hype died down, I had more time to think about it,” Barker said. “I just realized I didn’t want to be that far away from home...I’ll be around my parents so they can come see my games and be part of my life more than if I were in California.”
Athletic deals aside, Stanford could not provide the perks of regular parental visits—nor a family legacy.
Barker’s grandfather, John Copeland ’58, played three sports for Harvard, including the tight end position for the football team. Barker reminisced about watching games at Harvard Stadium with his grandfather as a youngster.
Perhaps this focus on family can explain why Robin Barker, Blake’s mother,  was not surprised at her son’s decision.
“He has always wanted to go to Harvard,” she answered in a confident tone. “It has been a busy year for him, looking at schools and speaking with various coaches around the country, but despite all the scholarship offers, it never changed the fact that he wanted to go to Harvard.”
The Barkers live in Wellesley, Mass. and proximity to Cambridge also allowed for easier access to the Harvard facilities and coaching staff.
“We’ve known Coach Murphy and Coach Lamb for the past year,” Robin said. “They’ve known how Blake has felt about everything.”
“I’m really looking forward to next year playing for Coach Murphy and Coach Lamb,” Blake added. “They’re just great guys and I’ve heard such great things about them as coaches.”
Barker’s decision represents a huge success for Harvard recruiting, especially in the midst of the recent, disappointing end to some highly-touted men’s basketball prospects—some of whom committed to Stanford. Furthermore, a commitment from the top player in the state could draw additional looks from similarly-touted recruits in the future.
“Anytime that a kid will turn down an offer from a bigger school to come to Harvard…it shows that it is a top level football school,” Ehrlich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just about every media outlet, from international newspapers to niche blogs, is having a field day writing about the so-called hard-hitting effects of Harvard’s budget cuts—no omelets for students, no cookies for faculty, and of course, no more free sweatsuits for all athletes.
Some accounts delve deeply into the effects on education and university life as a whole, while others simply dissect the notion of privilege for the fun of it.
We get it. The sharp economic downturn barely scratches the surface of the Harvard bubble when you compare it to “real” problems.
Let’s go back to athletics for a minute, as this subset of the greater Harvard population seems to be one of the most impacted. Changes that inconvenience all of us are of particular significance to athletes.
Of course, no hot breakfast means reduced protein without going Rocky style on the hard-boiled eggs, and revised shuttle schedules make the trip across the chilly Charles more treacherous.
But since the well-known heather gray DHAs are so coveted and symbolic around campus, they seem to be getting most of the attention.
However, just as they have with FAS, budget cuts have hit the entire athletics department, not just the sweater order form. What else is going on across the river?
For one, there is a pecking order within our 41 varsity sports programs. Our high-profile programs aren’t going anywhere, but they are certainly noticing visible changes.
“A few of us are definitely being affected by these cuts,” said senior Crimson running back Cheng Ho. “There’s no more hot breakfast, and a few of our guys lost a lot of weight because of that.”
Behind closed doors, members of the administration remain busy determining which areas the cuts will manifest themselves in. The Department of Athletics administrative staff, rightfully, seems exasperated when yet another obnoxious journalist (me) calls with prodding, budget-related inquiries.
Through carefully-crafted questions that were designed to derive valuable information from responses such as “no,” “I don’t know,” and “we can’t answer that,” I was able to get somewhere.
Though teams of all sizes have endured reduced travel budgets, the Athletic Department confirmed that one important aspect of team sports has remained largely intact—the schedules. For the most part, teams aren’t foregoing good competition to save dollars. It hasn’t come to that.
Unfortunately, the same is not entirely true for individual sports. Programs such as women’s tennis are sending less players to individual competitions than they used to.
We have to be able to take some sizable losses. Budget cuts have hit athletic departments hard across the country, and we don’t have it as bad as some. Schools are experiencing hikes in ticket prices, changes in facilities and fields, and most importantly, large-scale layoffs and salary reductions.
I came across a blog called Ultimate Sports Insider (www.ultimatesportsinsider.com) which outlines budget cuts in various athletic programs nationwide. It is run by Michael Cross, who is Executive Associate Director of Athletics at Princeton.
Cross provides information on how to absorb financial hits, how to fundraise, and how to run programs more efficiently.
One blog entry highlights New Mexico State, as its program called on fans and donors to provide evening snacks for its football team. This community-oriented example is just one of many strategies found on the site.
Returning to our downsizing efforts, one unexpected change in our program seems to have had a positive result. Students were blindsided when JV basketball, baseball, and ice hockey were cut last year and turned into club sports. However, some seem to think they are thriving as student-run entities.
“People are more involved and care more,” said senior Justin Hall, who is Vice President of Men’s Club Basketball. “Because its student-run, we’re more proactive in getting games, we have longer seasons, more practices. It’s something that we control.”
Competition is maintained, as the team plays against the same opponents that it did before. Because of its openness, there will likely be increased variety in its schedule in the coming months.
While not all transitions are so smooth, Harvard athletics must adapt to the best of its ability. Far from flashy to begin with, as long as maintaining healthy competition and high morale across Crimson teams remains a priority, we should be okay with a few less sweaters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The most fascinating thing about Harvard is the people—so the cliché goes. But for sophomore Nigel Munoz, a rower on men’s heavyweight crew, this adage could not be more true, thanks to his spirit of adventure and his drive to test the limits of his athleticism.
As a teammate, Munoz commands enormous respect from his peers thanks to his track record—he already holds two of the Crimson’s erg records for 2000 and 5000 meters—and his ability to exude a quiet dedication to his passions.
“As you know, he’s a monster of a man,” sophomore Robbie Stone says. “He really generates a lot of power, unlike most people I’ve seen. He’s the most extraordinary person I know here at heart. He’s the complete package.”
During his senior year in high school, a yearning to see the world prompted Munoz, who usually occupies the four or the six seat in the boat, to delay Harvard and hop on the bike for a world biking tour that saw him cover five continents.
“I was sitting there one day getting my hair cut, and I thought that it would be pretty cool to cycle around the world,” Munoz says.
Seeing an opportunity to conquer a challenge and broaden his horizons, Munoz could not resist, and left his home in London in December 2007 for a nine-and-a-half-month trip that ended in New York.
“My goal was to complete the 16,000 miles required for around-the-world cycling and to go through five continents, which is also required, and basically, to have a pretty cool time,” he explains.
From the deserts of Peru to the peaks of Tibet, Munoz pedaled through some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, as well as some of the planet’s most remote locations. Along the way, he accumulated memorable experiences like being incessantly stared at in Southern India or learning how to order Chinese food through sign language.
“I was with a friend and we cycled from Kathmandu up into the Himalyas, and it was just stunning,” Munoz says. “It was just the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen.”
After a long journey that saw Munoz fight off a head injury in Nicaragua, squeeze between trucks in a Chinese tunnel, and hitchhike for food in the deserts of Latin America, the rower is satisfied that the ride allowed him such a diverse set of life experiences.
“One of the lasting impressions was that people in the world are much more friendly than you think,” Munoz says. “People in the developed world sometimes think that the people in lesser-developed world are out to cheat you. However, the most unfriendly people I found by a mile were people in Europe, Australia, and America.”
But as if traversing so many countries on the bike was not enough, Munoz became intrigued with the idea of completing an Ironman triathlon. Known for breaking many athletes, the triathlon starts with a 2.4-mile swim and a 112-mile bike ride before participants complete a full marathon.
“I remember being totally petrified,” Munoz admits. “And I remember running down the swim ramp and [my] eyes tearing up and wondering what I was doing. But as soon as I hit the water, there was a smile on my face.”
Munoz finished in a remarkable 11 hours and 22 minutes, far exceeding his personal expectations.
The marathon component certainly posed the biggest hurdle for Munoz, but the sophomore responded with his typical drive to excel. Thanks to a summer of daily training, Munoz was ready to compete in Louisville, Kentucky’s Ironman triathlon just a few weeks before the start of his sophomore fall.
“There’s no way to train for as near long a distance as the real race,” Munoz explains. “So you don’t know how your body is going to respond.”
As the marathon progressed, he was able to improve from an initial 9:00 pace—thanks to his strong cardiovascular fitness—to post a time that is quite impressive for a first-time competitor.
However, all of Munoz’s life experiences and accomplishments don’t come across in his everyday interactions. To Munoz, his gap-year travel and Ironman feat are indicative of the diversity of accomplishments among his teammates and friends.
“I think he looks at these [experiences] more from the perspective of personal dedication, and he doesn’t need the recognition from other people to motivate him,” Stone says.
Though Munoz does not yet know about his future plans, he still hopes to maintain his spirit for adventure and conquering new challenges after graduation.
“I’d probably like to do something a little more adventurous and a little more unconventional [after graduation],” Munoz says. “I don’t want to be like everyone else. If something inspires me, I’m going to do it.”

If you walked by John Harvard today, you probably saw a small group of freshmen staked out in front of the statue.
Were they protecting it? No.
Protesting? Nope.
Punching? Initiating? Bingo.
The students, who claimed to be “guarding” John Harvard, spent the day preventing tourists from taking pictures. It was a measure of increased campus security, they said.
In reality the freshmen are Hasty Pudding punches initiates, or “neophytes” as the club likes to refer to them.  FlyBy wasn't lucky enough to be one of them, but those who made the cut received an email shortly before midnight on Tuesday that asked them to pretend to be John Harvard bodyguards from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. today, in one-hour shifts.
Said one neo, who asked not to be named for fear of offending the club’s leaders,
How did the camera-wielding tourists respond? More on the prank, after the jump.
When one tour group approached, led by an admissions office student tourguide, a neo dressed in all black explained that no picture-taking was allowed, because Ben Affleck was filming in the Square, and because President Obama would be in town soon. “We can’t have any clumping here,” the neo told the crowd.
“But we’re clumping even if we’re not taking pictures,” the confused tour guide replied. “Okay, back up guys,” the tour guide instructed her group. A boy on the tour yelled at the neos, “It’s America, brother.”
One woman went to a HUPD officer to ask permission to take a picture, then returned to the statue and demanded that she be allowed to photograph John Harvard without the neos in the picture. Being courteous, well-bred young men and women, they obliged.
According to one neo, eventually a HUPD cop showed up and asked what was going on. When the neos explained it was part of a punch, reportedly HUPD said they could carry on, as long as they weren’t rude, or doing anything illegal.
One neo thought the task was pretty funny:
The President of the Hasting Pudding Kate Harris could not be reached for comment.

Hollywood has just announced their cast for the Facebook movie (officially called The Social Network)—and it is an interesting cast, to say the least. And just so you don't have to wait until 2010 to evaluate the cast's acting skills, FlyBy has rated each member based on acting ability and their fit for the role.
In keeping with Harvard tradition, they were graded on a curve, which, of course, explains Jesse Eisenberg's four stars ranking.
Jesse Eisenberg - playing Mark Zuckerberg. 4 stars.
Jesse Eisenberg looks just like Mark Zuckerberg.  Cute, nerdy, curly brown hair, you know. His acting skills are not as up to par, though they do go well with any awkward young character to play.  In Adventureland, his most recent movie, which he headlined, he blinks and stares at the girl he likes (and who likes him) as he haltingly confesses to getting a bit serious on a date with someone else last week.
He concludes his confession with, "You're the one that—look, we'll both be in New York soon, and I want to hang out with you, I want to get to know you better—if you want to get to know me better, as well."
"James, you don't owe me anything," the girl says as she tries to walk away, devastated.
"I know—but, um, I want to owe you things. I'm ready to owe you things. I really care about you."
Mad eloquent. The script clearly didn't help there, and Mark Zuckerberg sees a similarly awkward portrayal in The Social Network complete with terrible dialogue. So, though Eisenberg's acting skills are only 2 stars, he does seem perfectly fitted for this role—looking just like Mark Zuckerberg and seemingly able to fulfill the hopes of the movie's scriptwriter.
More stars in the new Facebook movie, including Justin Timberlake, featured after the jump.
Justin Timberlake - playing early Zuckerburg adviser and Napster co-founder Sean Parker. 2 stars. 
His most notable role as an actor was probably in the SNL "Dick in the Box" skit, though he's been a guest on the TV show several times and has also appeared in CSI and So You Think You Can Dance (then again, he often appears on shows mostly as a music performer and not a legit actor). So, 2 stars for now, with the caveat that he may prove himself to be worthy of a more respectable 3 stars in the Facebook movie.
Andrew Garfield - playing spurned co-founder Eduardo Saverin. 2 stars.
Though Andrew Garfield was born in LA, he has had a British accent since his family moved to England three years after he was born. Unfortunately, the only clip of his acting that FlyBy was able to scrounge up was of him making a blunt proposition to a girl who he likes and who likes him. But...well, she's just shy of 16.
"I was thinking about it, and I was dreaming about it," he says on the carriage. "Let's do it. Why not, you and me?"
The flute and bells playing in the background are the only thing that makes the moment seem even slightly romantic.
Armie Hammer - playing both Winklevoss twins, the Olympic rowers who sued Zuckerberg for supposedly stealing their idea for Facebook. 1 star.
Gossip Girl generally comes off as obnoxious and very badly acted. So with Armie's most prominent role being as Gabriel Serrano—one of Serena van der Woodsen's love interests—on Gossip Girl, and not doing a great job of being a convincingly caring boyfriend, FlyBy has to give him the lowest grade of all.

All you hungry and lazy masses: today is HSA Market Day. The deadline to make orders online here has been extended from 4 to 7 PM today, so now you'll have some extra time to get those midnights cravings taken care of.
The deadline was extended for three more hours because of an increase of approximately 60 percent in revenue over last spring's Market Day, according to Michael K. Oberst '12, assistant manager of the Dorm Store, the agency that is running the program. The addition of Quincy House to the Market Day roster—which only included the four other Houses in its pilot stage—has yielded greater results.
"It's going great, and we just want to get all we can out of it," Oberst said in an interview with FlyBy earlier today. "So we figured that, as far as my time goes, it's worth the extra staying up four hours tonight."
Find out more about Market Day and details about pick-up, after the jump:
Market Day is a program run by Harvard Student Agencies that let's students purchase bulk items online—running the gamut from batteries to raspberry rugula—from Costco Wholesalers and have them delivered to their Houses. Right now, only five Houses are participating in the program, but students can order through a House not their own and pick up their goods from there.
Here are the times and locations for when students will be able to snatch up their goodies on Oct. 24:

Slushies! Everywhere!  (spoilers ahead).
This week, Will tries to write a mash-up for Emma and Ken’s wedding while struggling with his desire to steal her away. The popular crossover members of glee suffer in McKinley High’s social hierarchy, and the football boys question their commitment to New Directions. Puck and Rachel make out, Sue Sylvester falls in love (!?), and Ken almost kills glee.
Musical Numbers
“Bust a Move” by Young MC
This number is completely unjustified plot wise, but it’s fun overall. We think it’s kinda inapprops for Mr. S. to sing “a chick walks by you wish you could sex her” to Quinn, and we’re not sure what’s eating Kurt, but Will’s breakdancing is delightfully retro. The kids are fun singing backup, and we like that Matt and Mike are getting to dance plenty lately. FlyBy’s issue with the number is that it’s very… Acafellas-y. And we were not a fan of that side project. The show became all about Will instead of the kids, who are more entertaining, and they kept having Broadway star Matthew Morrison sing in entirely the wrong genre. We’ll let it slide; maybe it’s a one-time thing.
B
“Thong Song” by Sisqó featuring Foxy Brown
Nope. It’s literally like two minutes later and he’s at it again, mugging all over the classroom and not even letting Emma dance, which is supposedly the point of the scene. Instead it’s all about him – and Ken’s right, Will’s messing with Emma just because he’s “getting high off of her fawning over” him. “It’s the darn Thong Song!” says Emma, when the number ends poorly. “I don’t think it’s the song,” chuckles Will. Yeah, we don’t either. We’ve changed our minds, Emma. Plz marry Ken ASAP.

“What a Girl Wants” by Xtina
Lovely. This acoustic little scene is completely believable. It’s solid and surprisingly uncomplicated, although we loved the irony of Rachel singing this to Puck, who most definitely does not, in fact, “know exactly / What a girl wants / What a girl needs.”

“Sweet Caroline” by Neil Diamond
So we admit the first time we watched this we thought it was sluggish, sparse, and dead.  Turns out the original is, too; FlyBy’s just used to hearing it filled out with the energetic chorus of a thousand drunken fans. We think the song could have been used better in a rowdy, celebratory scene (post-sectionals?), but this is a worthy acoustic cover. Puck completely disregards Will's mash-up assignment, but if it helps a further another love rectangle, then sure, why not. Also, Santana’s look of disgust is pure gold. Quinn’s shell-shock, not so much.

It’s Sue Sylvester. Dancing.

“I Could Have Danced All Night”  as made famous by Julie Andrews & Audrey Hepburn
Emma stuns in the most gorgeous wedding dress ever. She’s like a Disney princess. She can sing! She can dance! Who knew? (Unless they dubbed her like Audrey, but we wouldn’t want to know. If this is a lie, it’s a lie we really want to believe.) The point-of-view shots are too claustrophobic and goofy, but otherwise this is just magic. As if we hadn’t been completely in love with Emma before. Good gracious.

Missing Plotlines
Sue’s Corner
She can dance! She can fall in love! Who knew? This from a woman who thinks “intimacy has no place in a marriage.” This week we also learned that while Sue was scarred by walking in on her parents – “it was like seeing two walruses wrestling” – she is capable of some lovely innuendo over a board game – “You sunk my battleship, Rob, and you sunk it HARD. [makes explosion noise].” The whole love storyline happens way too suddenly and ends too quickly for us, but we enjoyed it as an excuse to see her dance and wear a spectacular zoot suit, and we were comforted in seeing her mean and bitter again by the end. Quinn without the Cheerios!? Unthinkable. But if Sue thinks you’re “disgrace,” you’re a disgrace.
Best line of the week: “If it is one minute late, I will go to the animal shelter and get you a kitty cat. I will let you fall in love with that kitty cat. And then on some dark, cold night, I will steal away into your home and punch you in the face.”
The Short Version
Here’s the thing. Glee’s weakest moments have been when the show focuses too much on the grown-ups. “Acafellas” was cringe-worthy, and “Vitamin D,” while fun, fell a little flat between the spectacle of “Rhodes” and the high drama of “Throwdown.” This episode is somewhere in the middle, with entirely too much Will Schuester but mercifully less out-of-his-genre antics than in episode three. Still, we bring your attention to Best Week Ever’s current petition on the embarrassing state of affairs. We’re also troubled by the continuing trend of improbable, sudden emotional developments. Sue and Rob made a great storyline, just like Kurt and Mercedes, but why do the writers insist on cramming great setups into single episodes? The show needs more room for the character arcs to breathe. On the pro side, we liked all the fashion this episode, and especially enjoyed the scandal of seeing Quinn in street clothes. Take notes, everyone: clear raincoats and horrendous red zoot suits are in, trains on dresses are out.
Overall: B-. This snoozer of an episode almost got a straight C, but Emma and Sue are just too entertaining.

FlyBy has never liked ladybugs.  Those sickening little spots.  Those creepy little legs.  Oh, sure, some people think they’re cute.  And we’ll concede that their penchant for munching on aphids is a useful one.  But can you imagine a huge mass of ladybugs swarming all over your windows, trying to burrow in through the cracks as you stare in horror?
Well, watch out, dear FlyBy reader.  They’ve already hit Pfoho—your House could be next.
Find the details (including survival tips) after the jump.
Okay, okay, so we’re being a little overdramatic.  Still, ladybugs have been a very real problem at Pfoho.  Two days ago, Benjamin Rahn, a Pfoho tutor, wrote this message in an email sent over the House list:
“This afternoon I noticed some small groups of ladybugs around the windows of our suite—I then went outside to discover that they've taken quite a liking to the outside wall of Moors facing the quad, and so some must have decided to explore inside our slightly-open windows.  Folks living in Holmes and Wolbach have reported the same.”
In another thread, several other Pfoho residents complained about the ladybugs, musing that the pests are probably coming inside to escape the cold.  Rose Yan ’10 told FlyBy that she hasn’t seen any more ladybugs in her room recently, which could be due to the warmer weather today.
The overall number of ladybugs, thankfully, hasn’t been high—Rahn said he has seen only five to ten by each window.  “Had there been 100s it might have been very disturbing,” he added, “but in small groups they're interesting to watch.”
Erin R. Carey ’01, another Pfoho tutor, explained that these bugs are in fact probably not your garden-variety ladybugs.  Instead, they are most likely a particular kind of ladybug called Asian lady beetles, which are “an invasive species” and therefore the “more problematic insect.”  These pests are apparently a common nuisance in the fall, but neither Carey nor anyone else FlyBy talked to said they remembered ever seeing them at Pfoho before.
Should you find yourself the victim of a ladybug invasion (which will be more likely if your room faces south), here are some ways to deal: Keeping your windows closed is an easy and obvious first step.  You can also leave your lamp on, which will attract and trap the little pests.  If there are just too many, whip out the vacuum cleaner and clean those suckers up.
