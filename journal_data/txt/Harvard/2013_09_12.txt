After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the current system of General Education classes was put in place, the faculty envisioned courses that accomplished four broad goals: “to prepare students for civic engagement; to teach students to understand themselves as products of, and participants in, traditions of art, ideas, and values; to enable students to respond critically and constructively to change; and to develop students’ understanding of the ethical dimensions of what they say and do.”
Those goals are worthy and essential to a liberal arts education, and a framework of requirements is a necessary tool to engage students in fields they have not encountered before. But the Program in General Education is failing to achieve its aims because the courses being offered fall far short of their potential.
At their best, Gen Ed classes are among the most liked in the College. Of the 132 courses taught this semester that qualify for a Gen Ed requirement, 45 are rated 4 or higher in the Q Guide. At their worst, Gen Ed classes are laughably easy. Many of the current courses fail to achieve the faculty’s vision of classes “taught in a distinctive way and in the service of distinctive goals.” In many Gen Ed classes, it is impossible to see any organizational or pedagogical difference from a class that might be offered within a specific department. Some Gen Ed classes, especially ones known to be easy, are incredibly large. The quality of teaching and teaching fellows suffers perceptibly. These large courses dwarf the smaller, more personal ones.
Gen Ed can be so much more than it is today. The program is fortunate to draw professors from multiple departments or even schools to teach classes. These courses are an opportunity to encourage interdisciplinary thinking that is otherwise hard to achieve within the silos of individual departments. University President Drew G. Faust Faust told the University on Tuesday that “many of the most important and intriguing questions in the world transcend any single discipline or field.” At the undergraduate level, the Gen Ed program is an excellent framework to explore those questions.
Some Gen Ed classes are already on their way to doing this. The two professors who teach Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science” have gone out of their way to introduce students to physics and chemistry by applying it to food, a field that is traditionally thought of separately but is actually very much related. The value of courses like Science and Cooking is not so much in teaching students about science or cooking but in giving students a roadmap for thinking about many different ways to approach a problem. That type of learning is exactly what Gen Ed classes should encourage.
The goals of Gen Ed are good, but the implementation is very much a work in progress.

Edward Snowden was an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, a National Security Agency contractor, when he leaked details of secret surveillance programs conducted both by the NSA and by security agencies from other countries, to The Guardian. Anticipating a powerful backlash from the American security apparatus, he immediately left the United States, hiding in Moscow for a couple weeks before being granted asylum in Russia
He should not have needed to flee. Limiting the government’s power over its citizens is one of the core values of the United States. Snowden’s disclosures kept with this spirit, which is why he should not have feared prosecution.
Collection of intelligence has legitimate roles, even in a free society. It can be used to protect citizens from threats both foreign and domestic. It did so in one notorious case: the attempted Times Square bombing in 2010. Especially when dealing with terrorist threats, making such information public would allow wrongdoers to adapt their actions to avoid being caught. This is the main reason for the Patriot Act, designed shortly after 9/11 to expand U.S. surveillance against potential terrorist threats.
But any such surveillance program should be publicly known, limited in scope, and most importantly, approved by the U.S. population. The NSA’s extensive database of phone calls, emails, and other electronic communications from regular citizens does not fulfill any these conditions. It was an undercover operation that infringed on basic civil liberties such as the right to privacy and protection from unwarranted searches. The American population never agreed to their phone calls being secretly recorded; Congress, which represents the people, has never authorized such conduct.
Even the creator of the Patriot Act himself, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), has said, “Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.”
Given all of this, one wonders why Edward Snowden had to seek asylum in Russia. Russia is clearly not the most progressive country, and it has recently been on a trend of erecting more and more barriers to civil liberties, such as the recently enacted law against “homosexual propaganda.” Its decision to grant Snowden asylum has less to do with concerns about American surveillance programs than with cynical geopolitical calculations. Vladimir Putin’s government seeks to curb American influence around the world. By turning Snowden into an object of international attention, it can successfully defend itself from American accusations of authoritarianism by providing a counterexample that showcases American governmental overreach. Forcing someone who fights for freedom, such as Snowden, to leave the country for Russia certainly harms America’s image in the international community.
The United States’ image around the world has already been severely tainted in the past decade with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The last thing America needs is another scandal that will continue to fuel anti-American sentiment. Unfortunately, the American government’s response to the NSA leaks has yielded precisely that effect. French and Portuguese actions such as blocking Bolivian president Evo Morales’s plane for the suspicion that it was harboring Snowden contribute to the perception of American hubris. Espionage directed at several world leaders such as the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, and Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, compromise American relations with important, democratic allies. The nine-hour interrogation of David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who originally published the leaks, in Britain lends credence to the fear that even freedom of the press is being restricted.
While America’s European allies conducted many of these operations, such as the aircraft blockade, the blame ultimately falls with the United States, which for the past three months has moved heaven and earth to hunt down Snowden and anyone who may have collaborated with him. Shouldn’t the government be searching for terrorists instead of whistleblowers? The reaction to the Snowden affair has corroborated the impression of a bloated security apparatus distracted from its original mission of protecting the country from terrorist threats. The quest for Snowden was not started by worries about national security; it has always been about protecting and asserting governmental power.
Being confronted with a mistake, America is making another, bigger one. It should bring Edward Snowden back home as soon as possible, not to prosecute but to celebrate him. Such an action would keep with its historically progressive and democratic values, and it would work wonders to restore its damaged standing with other nations.

Spending time with my grandparents this summer, I found myself taken with the show tunes and ballads of their youth. Written by men who captivated Broadway and Hollywood with their inventiveness—Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin—and interpreted by midcentury’s best entertainers—Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald—the numbers of the Great American Songbook have been immortalized on vinyl and film.
I thought at first there was little to admire in my grandparents’ musical ken. Porter’s lyrical witticisms, dated though they are, were cause for mirth. The Gershwins, with their synthesis of jazz and the French classical style, clearly merited respect. Berlin’s compositions had a ritmo allegro that lent themselves to occasional listening.
But I had gripes with these composers. All, to one degree or another, had sold out to the movie industry, arranging for popular consumption works whose technical skill was outmatched only by their thematic banality. After “Porgy and Bess,” later to assume a central place in the canon, had flopped in its first Broadway run, Gershwin had moved out west, scoring sappy romances until his early death from brain cancer in 1938. “Shall We Dance,” the most renowned of these productions, stars Astaire and Rogers in a couple of the duo’s most arresting performances.
Watching the two pirouette on roller skates, I couldn’t help sneering at what was an unstinting display of decadence and mindlessness. Astaire and Rogers’s lines were as wooden as a log cabin, and they mouthed unsurpassably mawkish tropes about love and relationships. Berlin, and many associated with Tin Pan Alley, were guilty on the same charge. Porter was especially maddening, equating the romantic ideal with goods and services available for purchase—rendering explicit the link between capitalism and mass culture other musical theater mavens were content to insinuate.
A devotee of the folk movement, I hurled the heaviest brickbats at Berlin. Woody Guthrie had written “This Land Is Your Land” as a critique of “God Bless America,” which the rail-car troubadour thought ignored the plight of average Americans and glossed over the country’s Great Depression-era social ills: abject poverty and racial discrimination. The folkies were intensely political, and it reflects in their sheet music (or lack thereof). “I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it has hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built,” Guthrie said on one recording.
Porter, Berlin, and the Gershwins, I believed, had created chaste, apolitical culture for the white middle class, to the exclusion of others, and sometimes themselves. (Porter was gay; Berlin, a Russian Jewish immigrant, penned “White Christmas.”)
I have often implored my friends on the left to set aside politics as it relates to culture, at least when judging a piece’s artistic worth. Influenced by the New York intellectuals, I see the conflation of the two, usually entailing a view of culture mediated through political considerations, as a dangerous phenomenon. Demanding art be subject to such scrutiny is, if unconsciously, an outgrowth of a totalitarian mode of thinking, one the New York group, Dwight Macdonald above all, had seen and detested in Soviet Russia. An iconoclast of rare distinction, Macdonald had praised literary grandees for their decision to award the highest honor in American letters to Ezra Pound, who had thrown in with fascists and committed treason against the United States. (For the record, Macdonald likely would have castigated the composers in this discussion as midcult or masscult.)
Eventually, I followed my own advice. If Macdonald could overlook Pound’s fascism to appreciate the man’s literary talent, I could forgive Astaire and Rogers for being too lovey-dovey in the rink to praise their complex, dexterous moves. Berlin, Porter, the Gershwins, and their interpreters might have lacked in social conscience, but they had elevated contemporary pop culture.
And their works were not sexless, as I had once maintained. Porter was a master of implication, no small deed in our age of foam fingers and latex bikinis. “Let’s Do It (Let’s Fall In Love),” with its references to birds and bees, is highly suggestive, the effect heightened in Fitzgerald’s sultry rendition, the pauses between “let’s do it” and “let’s fall in love” allowing the first statement to linger unqualified.
Berlin was deserving of the same magnanimity. In fact, some of his work betrays a Promethean impulse to bring America to the uninitiated and outcast. “Puttin’ on the Ritz,” revised after the war, gives an outsider’s take on New York’s Park Avenue, satirizing and demystifying the tony precincts “where Rockefellers walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts.”  Secularizing a Christian holiday through wintry, bucolic imagery, “White Christmas” can be thought of in a similar vein.
A conclusion that had taken me months to reach had always been apparent to my grandparents. My grandfather always spoke of Porter’s clever lyrics but was thrilled when I found The Weavers’ music on YouTube. My grandmother sang “If I Had a Hammer” and “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” with equal gusto. I joined in on both songs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When people think about sustainability today, they often think about it in the contexts of attaining energy security and solving global warming. While this definition is pertinent to addressing our most immediate challenges today, sustainability actually deserves a broader perspective.
Sustainability has been a major challenge for us throughout modern history, encompassing the century-long concern of securing a sustainable energy source and the search for sustainable transportation. In the late 19th century, horse waste posed a major problem for urban dwellers. With 100,000 to 200,000 horses working as transportation in New York City, the city’s streets began seeing mounting piles (up to 60 feet) of horse manure, causing adverse health and environmental effects for its citizens. Not only did the horses create refuse faster than the city could clean up, the horses also posed an economic burden for the city. In a 1908 article in Appleton magazine, Harold Bolce estimated that New York City alone spent more than $1.6 billion on cleaning up after this externality.
Of course, technology eventually came to rescue. Mass-produced cars soon replaced the mass defecation, saving the city from its pressing environmental health hazards. Cars were viewed as the solution to the horse problem. Nevertheless, it’s interesting to draw a parallel between the environmental and economic effects that transportation posed a century ago and those that cars, the transportation “solution,” pose today.
The emissions from automobiles create problems that are much more global, elusive, and larger in scale than anything created by horses. Carbon emissions have increased the intensity, damage from, and unpredictability of storms, seriously affected the global ecosystem, and caused the continual rise in sea level that will force much of the world’s populations to relocate. Hurricane Sandy, the sort of extreme event caused and influenced by cars’ emissions, cost an estimated $50 billion—a very large sum relative to the small $1.6 billion cost of cleaning up after horses.
Although technology saved the day, the same underlying human attitude that drives the two similar outcomes separated by a century has largely stayed the same. This attitude is the lack of consideration and responsibility for the impacts individual and group behavior has on the public in the long run. The horse owners did not consider the impact the horses had on the city’s environment, nor did the new car owners consider the long-term impact of the reliance on and pollution from fossil fuels. In essence, sustainability is about considering and reacting to the impact one’s behavior has on the larger community, currently and into the future.
There are many examples where the real, sustainable solution was chosen over the immediate technological fix. An example appears in New York City’s water purification system. In 1997 the city realized that its water purification system was no longer up to scratch. In order to increase the quality of drinking water, the city considered a plan that would require spending $4 to $6 billion up front and $250 million annually for a new purification plant. However, instead the city decided to pursue a truly sustainable solution: They invested $250 million up front to buy land in the Catskill Mountains and $100 million annually to ensure that mountain residents minimized water pollution. Like the cars before it, this natural water filtration system saved New York money in the short term. But it did not stop there—it provided a sustainable solution that will outlast any filtration plant that the city could have built.
Unfortunately, these sustainable choices do not represent the majority. With our increasingly intensifying problems concerning natural resources, environment, and climate, our quick-and-easy-solution way of life seems to suggest that we have not changed much from the days of horse manure: We are still waiting and hoping that a magical technology will somehow solve our problems. But in due sense, we do already possess the technology to save the day. We already have existing technologies for sustainable purification plants, efficient electric cars, renewable energy, and recycling materials. The underlying problem is that we have more or less stayed silent as the effects of our choices disrupt the atmosphere. Sustainability, then, is as much about having the ability to reflect upon and consider our impacts as it is about the actual choices we make.
This concept of sustainability has been around since the age-old concept of karma in Buddhist philosophy. However, despite its long philosophical history, we have yet to fully implement the concept. It’s time for that to change. Sustainability must be embraced if we are to overcome everything from the unbearable smell of manure to the intense and unpredictable climate that will affect our entire planet.
We don’t believe that sustainability should only fit into the context of our energy and climate crisis. Rather, it’s a concept and philosophy that can be applied to many different areas of life and society. Although we definitely need new and effective technology to save us from the “horse manure” of our day, we also need to start considering the full ramifications of the ways we think about and react to our choices.

In a prime-time speech on Tuesday, President Obama addressed the nation to make the case for intervention in Syria and outline recent developments. FM caught up with New York Times Chief Washington Correspondent, HKS Adjunct Lecturer, and former Harvard Crimson editor David E. Sanger ’82 to hear his assessment of the situation now.
FM: The New York Times printed a poll before Tuesday’s speech reflecting scant public support for military intervention in Syria. Do you think the President was able to move the dial on those numbers after his speech?
DS: He moved it some. He made a much better case than ... he had made to date. If you look at the instant polls you will certainly see that. I don’t think he moved it dramatically.
FM: On Monday, Russia unexpectedly called on Syrian President Bashar Assad to hand over his chemical weapons stockpile to the international community. Say this offer is real and we go through with it. It doesn’t seem that we would have achieved U.S. objectives, if our objectives are in fact to achieve a diplomatic transition in Syria and the removal of chemical weapons in the country; it would achieve the latter but not the former. What would our foreign policy look like thereafter?
DS: Well, there’s two sets of issues here. You’ve got a first set of issues that have to do with the chemical weapons, and a second set of issues that have to do with the civil war. What [President Obama] has done with the civil war so far is that he’s lightly armed rebels, and he’s barely done that even. So he needs a much more comprehensive policy—but how to do deal with the civil war is separate from this objective.
FM: Secretary of State John Kerry generated a lot of buzz earlier this weekend when he said that any strike would be “unbelievably small.” In an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, President Obama responded: “The U.S. does not do pinpricks.” What do you think military strikes, if we took that route, would look like?
DS: So they were trying to alleviate the political objective that the United States was intervening for a long period of time. Obama was saying that by Syrian standards this would be a quite major strike. Both of those things could be true. But it could be major and still not be decisive—in other words, we might temporarily stop Assad from using chemical weapons but that’s not likely to change the balance of power in the global war. ... But Obama’s never argued that the attack would oust Assad.
This interview has been edited for concision.

Fifty-five percent of an audience disagreed with President Barack Obama’s proposal to intervene militarily following the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government after hearing a panel of experts discuss the proposal at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Wednesday evening.
These voters were only marginally less opposed to intervention than the general American public. According to a CBS News poll, 61 percent of Americans disapprove of the President’s proposition, while 30 percent approve. At the forum, however, 45 percent said they would vote in favor of the President’s proposal.
In late August, Obama asked Congress to authorize a limited air strike after it became clear that the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, had used chemical weapons against civilians in the midst of a nearly two-year-long civil war.
Tuesday night, Obama then requested Congress to postpone their vote after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his government would collect and destroy the Syrian government’s chemical arsenal. The panelists all expressed their disbelief that the Russian government would adequately eliminate the threat of chemical weapons.
A mock vote on the proposal now tabled before Congress was held at the end of the forum after attendees heard the opinions of international security program fellow Marisa L. Porges and Harvard faculty members R. Nicholas Burns, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph S. Nye Jr.
The forum also began with a vote as the event’s moderator, former Harvard Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison ’62, asked panel participants to share how they would cast their ballots if they were members of Congress.
Burns voted yes, warning, however, that “air strikes alone do not constitute a coherent strategy.”
Porges, who spoke of the importance of humanitarian aid and considering the civil war as a broader one and not an isolated event, said that she would not vote in favor of the President’s proposal.
“I don’t think the case for why this impacts US national security...has been made strongly enough by this administration,” she said, adding that the American public would need a more robust case following 12 straight years of war.
She suggested implementing a “diplomatic solution that would make end to the greater problem here...the hundreds of thousands that have died.”
Ferguson--after saying that Obama’s plans for limited air strikes against Syria were too little and too late--told Allison that he would vote for the proposal, but said that the strikes served little purpose other than to “salvage some credibility” for Obama.
He also advocated for the United States to play a role in regime change, saying that the airstrike, aimed at preventing further use of chemical weapons, implicitly gave a “green light” to the Assad regime to use any other means to quell rebellion.
Nye was the third panel member to state approval for the President’s proposal, although he said that he does not believe the United States should become too involved in the issue. Instead, he said, the US should be more concerned with East Asia, “the heart of the world’s economy.”
“Sometimes presidents have to do what they think is right,” Burns said, adding that he thought Obama should have acted militarily without congressional approval and, if he had done so, that it would have been constitutionally sound.
Similarly, Nye said that if it becomes apparent that the threat persists, Obama should intervene even without congressional or international approval.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
American flags around campus were at half staff Wednesday in memory of the terrorist attacks that transpired in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001. Several minutes of the morning service at Memorial Church were devoted to reflecting on the tragedy, and some other events were held around Harvard in memory of the day.
Two years ago, on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, there was a Harvard-wide event at Sanders Theater to commemorate the tragedy. Last year, many students gathered in front of the John Harvard statue for a moment of silence  in recognition of the day.
This year, several students said that they felt that the campus was relatively quiet about the anniversary on Wednesday.
“This year it snuck up on me,” said Scott W. Peters ’16. “I saw Facebook statuses that said, ‘Never forget.’”
Some students said that they were surprised, and others said they were disappointed, that there were not more events on campus organized in commemoration of the day. Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the events he was aware of events occurred at Memorial Church and individual Harvard Schools, including the Law School and Divinity School.
“[I thought] maybe we would’ve gotten an email from the school,” said Mia A. Capone ’16. “I definitely had the ‘Where were you?’ conversation at least three times today.”
Charley M. Falletta ’16 organized a commemorative event in memory of 9/11 in the Quincy courtyard Wednesday evening. Falletta, a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadet, played “Taps” on the trumpet in the courtyard for a crowd of about 25 students and other community members.
In an interview after she played the tune, Falletta, who specified that she was speaking as an individual and not for ROTC or for the military, expressed regret that others in the community may have gone the day without realizing its significance.
“This is a turning point in our country’s history, and it’s something that I do feel is already, [after] 12 years, is slipping away a little bit,” Falletta said.
Many students took their own time to reflect on the day and what it meant to them.
Madalyn S. Bates’s ’14 family members were traveling to different places across the country on Wednesday, on different flights. She reflected on the fact that, had her family members been traveling in 2001, the situation could have been much different.
“This time in 2001, for some of the families that were traveling, it was their last time [together],” Bates said.
After the morning service at Memorial Church, Ann W. Stevenson, interim associate rector for pastoral care, reflected on the day.
“I think it’s a day of mourning. I also hope it’s a day to reflect and learn lessons from the violence we inflict on each other. At the heart of things, everyone wants peace,” Stevenson said.

As Harvard’s new Queer Advisory Council rounds out its membership as it prepares to convene for the first time this fall, several student leaders said they are optimistic that the Council will provide important opportunities to address a wide range of issues relevant to Harvard’s BGLTQ community.
The QuAC will consist of one representative member from each of the eight BGLTQ-identified student groups on campus and five at-large members from the undergraduate community as a whole. The application period for students interested in filling one of the Council’s at-large seats end on Monday.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, communications and conference chair for the QSA, praised the formation of the Council and said she hopes the QuAC will give direction and cohesion to ideas that have been long discussed in the BGLTQ community, such as gender-neutral housing in the Houses.
“The [QuAC] has a lot of potential, but there are different ideas of how to move forward, and what that looks like,” she said.
Suslovic also said that she would like to see the QuAC address divisions in Harvard’s BGLTQ community, citing the varied and numerous perspectives that exist among Harvard’s queer students. The student groups that will be involved in the QuAC each differ greatly in size and membership, and according to Suslovic, this has led to a lack of collaboration in the past.
Neimy K. Escobar ’15, co-chair of Harvard’s Queer Students and Allies who will serve on the QuAC, said she is pleased that the QuAC will provide grants for students hosting events related to the BGLTQ community. Escobar, who is also a coordinator for the Queer Resource Center, said she is excited about the initiative both as a member of the QuAC and as a student who could potentially benefit from its funding.
Escobar added that while it is too early to pinpoint all of the specific issues that the QuAC will address, she is excited for all the new opportunities the initiative will create.
Suslovic said that one of the most important functions of QuAC will be its role in permitting students to give direct feedback to the administration.
Kirin Gupta ’16, cultural diversity chair for the QSA, agreed that the QuAC is a step forward, citing the success of similar student advocacy groups such as the Harvard Foundation Student Advisory Committee and the Women’s Cabinet of Harvard College Women’s Center. However, she also cautioned that such groups sometimes fail at being truly representative.
“The real concern is to make sure that student voices really are heard,” she said. “The QuAC should be representative of the queer student body as a whole, and not just sections of it.”

In fall 2009, computer science lecturer David J. Malan welcomed 337 aspiring coders to his introductory computer science course CS50. Four years later, the course’s enrollment has more than doubled, closing in on—but just failing to surpass—the introductory economics course Ec 10a as Harvard’s most popular class.
CS50 enrolled 759 students this term, according to preliminary course enrollment numbers posted on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s website. Course enrollment numbers referenced in this story are updated as of early Thursday morning.
“We're thrilled that so many students have been taking an interest in computer science,” Malan wrote in an email Wednesday night.
While Malan did not venture to speculate why so many students opted to take the course, he wrote that he and his teaching staff have “endeavored to build within CS50 a support structure atop which any student can succeed, irrespective of background.”
In another story of dramatic growth, statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein’s Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” experienced a 56 percent increase in enrollment from last year, growing from 308 to 482.
Ec 10a, formerly known as Ec 10 prior to a listing change, remained Harvard’s most popular fall course for the third year running.
The General Education course Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory,” rounded out the top three highest registered classes, drawing 701 enrollees, a 33 percent enrollment increase over last year.
Science of Living Systems 20: “Introduction to Psychology,” enrolled 373, making it this semester’s second-highest enrolled Gen Ed class.
Instructors of high-enrolled classes offered differing explanations for their course’s popularity.
Chinese history professor Michael J. Puett, who teaches Ethical Reasoning 18, attributed his course’s steadily increasing enrollment to “‘life-changing’” course materials and publicity via word of mouth.
The course’s head teaching fellow, Nuri Kim, had a slightly different take on the course’s popularity, pointing to Puett’s “outstanding” and “effortless” lectures and his growing reputation.
Kim also acknowledged that Michael J. Sandel’s perennially popular course, Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice,” is not being offered this semester, meaning many students seeking an Ethical Reasoning credit may have turned to “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory.”
Blitzstein, the Statistics 110 instructor, pointed to the applicability and elegance of his course material as explanations for the course’s high enrollment.
“I think there is an increasing realization, both at Harvard and internationally, that data are everywhere and statistics is needed everywhere there is data!” he wrote in an email. “I think [the increase in interest] reflects the fact that statistics is both aesthetically beautiful and intensely useful.”
SLS 20 head teaching fellow Roman Feiman attributed the course’s high enrollment to the strong teaching of psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert, the course’s instructor this fall, as well as that of psychology professor Steven A. Pinker, who often teaches the course in the spring.
Feiman also pointed to both men’s bestselling books, media appearances, and general renown outside Harvard, as well as the appeal of the discipline of psychology, as explanations of student interest in the course.
Steady growth seemed to be the trend among many of Harvard’s perennially popular courses. But as computer science and statistics classes become increasingly popular, life sciences has experienced a slow but steady decline. Life Sciences 1a, Harvard’s introductory biology and chemistry course, has experienced a nearly 20 percent decrease in enrollment over the past three years, shrinking from 537 in 2010 to 448 this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Class of 2014 cast roughly 1,000 votes to choose their senior class marshal finalists, but it was a last-minute vote that created a tie among two of the candidates and resulted in the selection of 17 finalists, rather than the usual 16. The finalists, eight of whom will ultimately represent their class this year and beyond as marshals, were announced Thursday morning.
This year’s finalists are Yolanda K. Borquaye, Gashaw Clark, Christopher H. Cleveland, Peter G. Cornick, Erin D. Drake, Ginny C. Fahs, Harleen K. Gambhir, Grant M. Jones, Sandesh K. Kataria, Sharon K. Kelleher, Pascal Mensah, Gorick K.H. Ng, Anthony A. Palillo, David F. Sackstein, Akshay M. Sharma, Roland Yang, and Jen Q.Y. Zhu. They will vie for the eight class marshal spots in a final round of voting Thursday.
The number of votes cast in this year’s first voting round stayed roughly constant from last year but increased relative to previous years, according to Clint Ficula, the Harvard Alumni Association’s assistant director for undergraduate engagement, who also provided The Crimson with data on this year’s vote.
After several days of enthusiastic campaigning, 69 first-round candidates faced voters beginning Tuesday morning. After voting closed Wednesday morning, the 17 finalists were notified that they had advanced to the next round later in the day.
Speaking in phone interviews Wednesday evening, several finalists offered insights from the class marshal campaign trail.
Ng, a finalist from Lowell House, said he ran his campaign using Facebook, text messages, and face-to-face conversations.
“I’m really fortunate to have had the experience of reaching out to friends from all corners of the University,” he said.
Jones, who hails from Winthrop House, said he tried not to overwhelm his classmates with campaigning in the first round of voting.
“A lot of seniors feel very overwhelmed with the amount of campaigning that has been going on in the first round,” Jones said. “I try to play it a little more casually and to let people know I am running but not saturate them too much.”
With the stakes raised in the final round, however, he said he may be a bit more “aggressive” in his campaigning this time around.
Gambhir, a finalist from Leverett House, said there is “something very awkward” in the concept of students voting amongst their peers in a class marshal election.
“The process is kind of silly but the end result is really important,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard administration has secured a donor for a campus center and will soon begin planning for its development, University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson earlier this week.
She declined to identify the donor, citing that person’s wishes, but said that the name would be revealed in an announcement later this fall. “It’s going to happen, but we will tell you the specifics when we get all the ‘t’s crossed and ‘i’s dotted for the announcement,” Faust said.
Faust also declined to reveal the gift’s size, again citing the donor’s wishes, and said that it will likely never be revealed publicly.
“But it will make the project doable,” she added. “So we’re very excited.”
The donation comes as part of The Harvard Campaign, a nearly decade-long, University-wide fundraising drive whose public phase will officially launch next Saturday. Faust told The Crimson nearly one year ago that the center would be a priority for the campaign. She also said at the time that it would likely be built in Holyoke Center and contain a variety of spaces designed for everything from parties to lectures and studying.
Faust said that administrators are beginning to organize a planning and consultation process for the center that will incorporate input from students, House Masters, and faculty members.
The Undergraduate Council has long been calling for a student center along the lines of those that exist at other universities, and in 2011, the UC presented a report to Faust asking for a student center specifically for undergraduates. Faust, however, has repeatedly called it a “campus center” that will cater to the entire University.
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 described the announcement as “very exciting for us as an institution,” though she noted that she had been unaware of the donation before being approached by The Crimson.
Raghuveer also emphasized the importance of engaging students in decisions about the center. “I’m glad to hear that [Faust] has a sustained commitment to keeping students involved in the process,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another somewhat encouraging performance ended in another discouraging result for the Harvard women’s soccer team (0-3-0).
After falling in a 2-0 hole early against New Hampshire, the Crimson could not quite recover under the lights of Soldiers Field Wednesday night.
“I’m really proud of our team because we didn’t back off,” freshman forward Midge Purse said of the squad’s mentality. “It was ok, now we are down 2-0, now we need to get two more goals.”
Harvard won the possession battle and produced numerous chances but couldn’t overcome the deficit and fell by a final score of 2-1.
“It wasn’t like we were emotionally defeated,” captain Peyton Johnson said. “We were pressing until the very last minute.”
The Wildcats struck first as Kennedy Nickerson’s free kick found Jordan Logue, who slipped it across her body and past junior goalkeeper Bethany Kanten into the corner of the net.
Moments later, Nickerson took a corner that landed in front of the goal and found its way to the back of the net off a Crimson defender.
“Collectively, when we do play well, it just feels a lot better than that, and it wasn’t there tonight,” Purse said.
Harvard picked it up later in the half. One of its best chances came courtesy of Johnson who connected with junior defender Marie Margolius to line a shot at New Hampshire goalkeeper Mimi Borkan.
Johnson once again had a golden chance to put the ball in the net with just eight minutes remaining in the half on a penalty kick, but Borkan guessed correctly, thwarting any positive momentum.
“I think we had a pretty dominant performance but didn’t put it together,” Johnson said.
At halftime, despite being down, the Crimson held the advantage in chances, outshooting its opponent 9-2. Seeking a spark on the defensive end, Harvard also made a substitution at goalkeeper, inserting junior Cheta Emba.
“Coach reminded us it was a position we had been in before,” Johnson said. “And he just told us that the chances will come if we are patient.”
The first threat of the second half came three minutes in when Purse sent a ball across the lip of the goal to charging junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby who was staring at an empty net if she had gotten to the ball.
Harvard didn’t let up thereafter, recording each of the final 12 shots. The Crimson outshot the Wildcats 21-2 over the course of the game.
“There was a lot of heart out on the field,” Purse said. “Everyone pushed their way through.”
The lone goal of the half came with 39 minutes left to go when Midge Purse collected a ball that bounced in her direction and drove it into the back of the net. The goal came as the result of a rebound following up a powerful attempt by Casscells-Hamby that Borkan failed to control.
“There were a lot of us in the box, we got the ball down there, and we scored. It was determination. We all put that ball in the net,” said the freshman of her first college goal.
New Hampshire was able to fend off the Crimson in a tense last half hour and a hectic last two minutes to hold onto the victory.
“I think UNH did a good job giving us fewer chances and making us work harder for the ball,” Johnson said.
The Crimson’s trouble finding the back of the net continued. Despite outshooting its opponents, 28-15, in two closely fought battles over an encouraging weekend out west, the Crimson only managed one goal and lost both games.
“It hurts,” Purse said. “You leave it all out there, and you don’t get the result that you wanted, but that’s the game of soccer.”
Harvard was in familiar territory playing from behind against the Wildcats. Last year, the squad also fell behind, 1-0, before scoring a pair to take the match, 2-1.
The match marked the first game the Crimson played at Soldiers Field this season. The last time Harvard lost its home opener was in 2006, when it fell to Central Connecticut State. Last season, the Crimson recorded a 4-2-3 record at home.
Before Wednesday, Harvard hadn’t lost to New Hampshire in eight seasons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a minute’s time, New Hampshire knocked two goals in against the Crimson less than six minutes into the contest.  Despite generating almost no offensive pressure the rest of the match, the Wildcats were able to hold off a Harvard rally to win, 2-1.
The loss marked the Crimson’s first in the past eight matchups against the Wildcats. The contest also opened Harvard’s season at home, with the Crimson facing two more opponents at Soldiers Field later this week.
MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
While New Hampshire squeezed out the win by a goal, Harvard’s shots outnumbered those of the Wildcats, 21-2. The Crimson failed to execute in front of goal throughout the match, particularly in the first period that sent the Harvard squad into halftime down, 2-0.
Two prominent missed opportunities on goal both occurred in the 37th minute of the first half, the first of which came from co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson, who rocketed a penalty kick in the middle left region of the net, where New Hampshire goalkeeper Mimi Borkan quickly moved to deflect the ball out of bounds.
Seconds later, the Crimson earned a chance from a throw-in from the left wing, as junior defender Marie Margolius received the ball and shot low and hard. Again, Borkan swiftly slid to the ball to regain possession for the Wildcats.
The Harvard offense often strung together quick passes to keep the ball moving, but the final shot or cross did not connect.
In the final minutes of the first period, freshman forward Midge Purce stole the ball at midfield and dished it out to junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby, who was called offside. Several corner kicks and crosses slid through the 18-yard box without contact, and at other times the Crimson failed to come up on the right side of a bobbling ball. With less than a minute left on the clock for the final frame, Harvard and New Hampshire players struggled for possession in the Crimson’s offensive third, with the ball ultimately ending up on the left sideline for a Wildcats throw-in.
“No one likes to lose,” Purse said. “Our team is extremely competitive, and that’s how it is in the Ivy League, and that’s how our team is, so everyone is more than a little upset right now. We know we can play a lot better than we did, and we have a lot of talent on our team.”
FRESHMEN FOOTWORK
Several freshmen took the field for the home opener, including Harvard’s lone scorer for the night, Purce. The forward displayed her talented footwork, in one play chipping the ball over her defender’s head to advance towards goal. Halfway through the second half, Purce hit a hard shot into the goalie’s hands while she was still in the air. Several times, the freshman juked out several defenders before dishing it out to a teammate or taking a shot herself. Altogether, Purce registered five shots for the match.
Her goal came in the sixth minute after halftime, as she netted a deflection off of a shot by teammate Casscells-Hamby.
Other freshmen standouts included forward Karly Zlatic and defender Bailey Gary. Zlatic registered three shots on goal and proved invaluable on the left wing. Gary was strong on the right side on defense and tallied two shots, one of which was on goal.
SECOND HALF SURGE
The Crimson came out after halftime with a new energy, scoring a goal within six minutes. Compared to only eight shots in the first frame, Harvard notched 13 shots and held the New Hampshire offense out of the Crimson defensive third for the majority of the latter 45 minutes. Harvard was able to capitalize off of the Wildcats’ frustration and draw a total of 13 fouls by the end of the contest.
Rarely leaving its offensive half, the Crimson offense fired shots whenever it could during the second frame. Heading into the 70th minute, freshmen Purce and Zlatic fought to snag another goal for Harvard, registering a combined three shots in less than a minute.
Even in the final eight seconds of the game, the Crimson kept fighting. Junior goalkeeper Cheta Emba came up past midfield to help out on offense as junior forward Erika Garcia chipped it in to Bailey, who shot the ball into the keeper’s arms.
Harvard will have to shake off the loss as they head into the weekend, playing Providence and LIU Brooklyn on Friday and Sunday.
