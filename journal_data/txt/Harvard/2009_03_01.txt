When George Balanchine’s “Jewels” first premiered at New York City Ballet in 1967 it was one of his boldest experiments yet—a full-length ballet without a narrative. The Boston Ballet is bringing the performance to life again, articulating every move with an infectious sense of energy and commitment to the art.The ballet is divided into a triptych—“Emeralds,” “Rubies,” and “Diamonds”—with each segment evoking an aspect of Balanchine’s life and career. The dancers capture the spirit of each piece as Balanchine intended it to be perceived. Balanchine’s career began in Russia’s St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet. After the Russian Revolution, he moved on to France in the twenties and thirties and finally to America where his artistic genius took off. In “Emeralds,” “Rubies” and “Diamonds,” Balanchine evokes each country that formed the basis of his career—their national spirit and the spirit of their ballet. “Jewels,” despite the obviousness of its eponymous theme, is a masterpiece, and the Boston Ballet Company rises to the challenge of presenting it as such.“Emeralds,” set to Gabriel Faure’s “Pelleas et Melisande and Shylock,” employs the vocabulary of French classical ballet. The story of Pelleas et Melisande is a mysterious tale evoking the origins of the French national sensibility. It features pastoral and water imagery which is reflected in the fluid, symmetrical movement of the dancers, as well as the effective costume and design choices. The curtain is drawn to reveal a stylized woodland scene. White curtains set off the deep emerald green background, and the cast of female dancers, in their long green tulle skirts, match their environment perfectly. The first half focuses on port de bras, with the dancers dividing into pairs and mirroring each other, again emphasizing the dreamy, aquatic nature of the piece. The formal nature of the movements is perfectly articulated, quietly mesmerizing the viewer. The central piece, “Rubies,” represents the new American style of dance—namely jazz—that Balanchine discovered upon arrival his arrival in New York City. The dancers in this piece are predictably dressed in ruby-red, the women donning the skimpiest outfits of the production—perhaps a nod to the New York City jazz clubs. The salacious energy of jazz combined with ballet creates a fascinating, discordant form of dance reinforced by Igor Stravinsky’s slightly off-key “Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra.” The “Capriccio,” true to its name, changes tone and instrumental focus every minute or so, and at times seems to have two themes playing at once. Similarly, the dancing is playful and slightly confused; typically refined dancers swing their hips, men jog gracefully across the stage, and a couple circle one another, skipping imaginary jump ropes.The curtain opened to a collective gasp in the last piece, “Diamonds,” revealing a stage that at first glance did in fact resemble the interior of a diamond; a pale blue backdrop contrasted with the white-gold curtains, setting the scene for female dancers dressed entirely in white. “Diamonds” is danced to the quintessential Russian composer Tchaikovsky’s “Symphony No. 3.” The dance is in the classical Russian style, with much promenading and magnificence. The piece seemed to offer a glimpse into the interior of Balanchine’s mind, with its symmetry and playfulness. “Jewels” is an ambitious piece, particularly because its emotional and artistic impact relies so much on the precision and perfection with which it is performed. The very fact that the Boston Ballet would undertake such a challenging piece symbolizes the organization’s progress to a more educated audience. As the “Jewels” playbill notes, “in producing Jewels, Boston Ballet enters a league that includes such major international companies as The Royal Ballet/Covent Garden, the Paris Opera Ballet and the Maryinsky Theater’s Kirov Ballet.” Whether all the Boston Ballet’s ambitions will be realized or not, this particular performance of “Jewels” was certainly successful, leading one audience member to remark with a note of pride, “The company has come so far.”

Harvard provides myriad artistic performances. However, its not always obvious how culturally diverse these performance groups are.Cultural Rhythms, an annual event organized by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations which took place Saturday afternoon, proved that there is no better manifestation of the talent and diversity of Harvard College than cultural music and dance.Artist of the Year, Dan Aykroyd, the distinguished actor, musician, and screenwriter, expressed admiration for these enormously different performing groups and their well-rehearsed presentations. “I’ll never forget this day,” Aykroyd claimed. “This was just great.” “Great” barely scratches the surface.Saturday afternoon’s performance opened with a number by Corcairdhearg, the Harvard College Irish Dancers. Their flashy, glittering costumes and elaborate headpieces were upstaged only by the amazing technical precision of their footwork. In an interview with Aykroyd after their number, two members revealed that several members of the Irish dance group would be attending the World Championships this year. The almost inhuman synchronization of their movements made this news hardly surprising.Corcairdhearg was followed by Ballet Folorico de Aztlan, a worthy follow-up with their dazzlingly colorful skirts and graceful turns. The Harvard Intertribal Indian Dance Troupe, the Ukrainian Folk Dancers, and the Asian American Dance Troupe introduced the audience to their intriguing and equally impressive cultural styles and vibrant traditional costumes. The much beloved Kuumba Singers of Harvard College closed the first act, offering a different, but equally satisfying, type of performance from those preceding it.The second act of the afternoon show continued to impress with the wide array of cultures and talents Harvard boasts. Tommy and Andres, a two-man band, sang about a picturesque Lithuanian peninsula town; even though the two sported get-ups and relied simply on a guitar, a violin and their voices, their performance equaled other, flashier numbers.The Harvard Breakers infused the show with new energy, popping, locking, and spinning upside down. In the subsequent interview with Aykroyd, one member explained that he was one of four choreographers to assemble the piece, reminding us that the talent possessed by the members of Harvard dance groups is not simply limited to execution.The Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble sustained this vibrancy with choreography representative of many national cultures accompanied by skilled drumming. The dancers of the Harvard College Gumboots Troupe, which originated stylistically from the mines of apartheid South Africa, presented a more specific African heritage. Members danced in rubber boots while creating a beat of clapping, stomping, and chanting in a largely similar to spirit to the off-Broadway performing group STOMP. The show could not have closed with a more appropriate finale, which consisted of representatives from each of the groups returning to the stage, first performing an excerpt of their own style, and finishing by coming together to all perform to the theme of Akroyd’s beloved movie “Ghostbuster,” which he wrote and starred in.In addition to the tremendous talent portrayed throughout the afternoon, one must appreciate the number of students involved in each group. With the exception of the smaller Leña Dance Company and the duo of Tommy and Andres, each group took to the stage with at least eight dancers, singers, or instrumentalists, and often closer to twenty; Kuumba featured upward of thirty capable voices.  Cultural Rhythms 2009 proved once again why it has been tradition that has existed at Harvard for 24 years. In addition to celebrating the cultural diversity of the University, this amazing spectacle drives home the fact that Harvard students possess humbling talent that stretches far beyond the lecture hall. And this is always worthy of celebration.

If Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Dr. Seuss traversed the centuries that separate them to collaborate on a piece, it would be “Green Eggs and Hamadeus.” Just as the combinatory title suggests, Rob Kapilow’s “Green Eggs and Hamadeus” merges performance and audience, tradition and innovation, and—of course—Mozart and Dr. Seuss. As a presentation of the “Celebrity Series of Boston,” an organization founded to further the performing arts in Boston, this original work comes to Boston University’s Tsai Performance Center with the aim of bringing classical music to life, even for children.Kapilow, nicknamed the “Pied Piper of classical music,” aims to help audiences of all ages and backgrounds to make connections to the music that often seems esoteric and boring. “Green Eggs and Hamadeus” is one of the most recent pieces composed, conducted, and commentated by Kapilow, and it truly succeeds in making the music accessible and fun to viewers—ranging from squirmy, eager five-year olds to their grandparents.In his quest to demonstrate music as “telling a story with no words, just notes,” Kapilow spends the first half of the 1-hour performance explaining the intricate mechanics behind Mozart’s “Eine kleine Nachtmusik.” Asking the audience to clap the rhythm and sing the tune with a series of “bum” and “bo-da-ga-bum,” Kapilow helps the audience become more familiar with the music. After these mini lessons, the grinning conductor poses “quiz” questions, requesting that the audience answer with a unanimous “Tempo!” or “Accompaniment!” This interactive educational sequence paves an irresistibly engaging and entertaining segue into the full piece itself.His explanations, coupled with live examples on the piano, are simple yet informative, easy to digest without sounding like excerpts from “Classical Music for Dummies.” Kapilow is remarkably straightforward with his comments and makes the information easy to retain through funny quips—“Yes, ‘bum’ is the first word of this song”—and activities like creating sixteenth notes by slapping on the thighs. 	The techniques behind musical phrasing and motifs are brought down to the comprehensible level of his junior audience. The ensemble itself is small, including only two violinists, one violist, one cellist, and one bassist, but the intimate size of the group is useful as it allows for the audience to better hear the subtle elements of Kapilow’s lessons.A large part of the presentation’s appeal lies in Kapilow’s lively mannerisms and enthusiastic voice, making it difficult to resist his magnetic pull. With hair flying as he conducts, his hand and arm movements morph into a continuous stream of hops and goofy dancing. In breaking free from the seriousness of traditional conductors, he is both humorous and demonstrative of the fact that classical music can be fun.Thanks to Kapilow’s lessons, the crucial elements of  “Eine kleine Nachtmusik”—the surprise in each phrase, the sparkle made possible by underlying, repeated sixteenth notes—come alive, truly transforming the piece into a story the audience could fully understand.With the last G major chord of “Rondo” ringing the decisive finale to the first half of the presentation, the stage is rapidly rearranged to replace the music stands with a stool, a chair, and a table set for breakfast. Kapilow reemerges to present his own original piece, named “Green Eggs and Ham,” named after the well-known rhyme by Dr. Seuss.Like he does with “Eine kleine Nachtmusik,” Kapilow involves the entire audience in a conversation and an activity. Furthermore, he transforms each line of Dr. Seuss’s work into a varied, expressive musical phrase. By adding his own personal touches, like an adaptation of “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad” preceding the lines of “A train, a train, a train, a train! Could you, would you on a train?”—Kapilow transforms Dr. Seuss’s classic tale.  In addition to adding variety, the creative arrangement and interplay of ritardandos, accelerandos, crescendos, and diminuendos further the emotional component of “Green Eggs and Ham” and shape the plot dimension of the otherwise playful but repetitive rhyme.The biggest success of “Green Eggs and Hamadeus” is the appeal to a remarkably wide range of ages and its interactive, engaging presentation. The line between performers and audience is blurred from the beginning to end of the hour, and both children and adults alike are inspired to learn more about music.Kapilow turns the stuffiness of a classical concert into a fresh, participatory show, enhancing the performance with an innovative approach to a time-tested classical piece and an original contemporary work.  Though this presentation may at first seem as puzzling or doubtful as a plate of green eggs, especially for those beyond the age of 11, it is a performance that is sure to make one want music here and there and anywhere.

With the aid of a notebook, a microphone, and a glass of water, Spalding Gray became famous by exposing his most personal thoughts and his life’s intimate details through monologues. His work was so inseparable from the man that it is nearly impossible to imagine what his stories would be without the self-deprecating and often profound figure behind the mic. But none of the five actors in “Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell,” performed at the Institute of Contemporary Art Thursday through Sunday, were Spalding Gray. A middle-aged woman, a man with a foreign accent, and the colorful ex-mayor of Providence Vincent A. “Buddy” Cianci, Jr., all stepped in to read Gray’s words. Yet this physical disparity was inconsequential; Gray’s words retained their appeal, capturing his life with a familiar poignancy.After a long struggle with depression exacerbated by injuries sustained from a car accident, Gray committed suicide in 2004. Kathleen Russo, Gray’s widow, compiled “Stories Left to Tell” in tribute to her deceased husband. Taking material from Gray’s more famous monologues as well as his never-before-performed journal entries, she was able to create a loosely chronological picture of his life.The play started with a vignette inspired by his children and then circled back to Gray’s painfully funny stories of adolescence in a small Rhode Island town. Each actor performed monologues centered on a different thematic element of Gray’s life—his exploits, his sexual encounters, or his fatherly instincts. Four seasoned performers–-Josh Lefkowitz, Ain Gordon, David Cale and Alina Troyana—told stories from Gray’s personal life; each night, a different guest personality each night played the role of Gray grappling with fame. On Saturday night, Cianci joined the cast.The actors themselves seemed to take secondary roles to Gray’s words. While the four regular actors spoke their lines with confidence, even the more hesitant recital of Cianci still possessed the power of Gray’s words, a testament to Gray’s power as a writer.  And while each delivered lines marked by his own cadence (Cianci, for example, often stopped and looked pointedly at the audience to elicit laughter), it was clear that they represented one voice.In many ways, the original design of Gray’s performances was preserved. The set consisted of three black platforms, some dark simple furniture on which the actors perched, and a simple backdrop that changed color as the monologues changed in tone and content. Each actor took turns reading Gray’s words from their black binder, occasionally moving around the set but never breaking out of character.The actors resisted Gray’s minimalist aesthetic at times and tried to sensationalize Gray’s emotions, in the process rendering his measured words overly dramatic. In one such moment, Ain Gordon choked up while reading Gray’s journal entries detailing his slip into mental decline. Instead of successfully conveying the subtlety of Gray’s emotion, the effect was laughable.As with any story with such a dark and well-known ending, “Stories Left to Tell” always ran the risk of being overdone, but Gray’s sense of humor grounded the play. In one monologue, Gray asks his aging father piercing questions like, “Do you have any regrets?” It is a heavy scene until Gray asks his final question: “Why was I the only one that wasn’t circumcised?” he asks. “You weren’t?” his father responds.Gray took his craft seriously, but he looked at his life with a sense humor that kept him from crossing over into the melodramatic. “Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell” is a tribute to Gray the person, and more importantly, Gray the writer. It is no small feat that the actors managed to keep the posthumous work funny and realistic, only occasionally bordering on the theatrical.Ultimately, Gray’s story can only be told through his words, and it is these words that are the biggest character in the play. Gray says in his journal, “I came to know of my life through the telling of it,” and the audience was lucky enough to be afforded the same opportunity.

Last Thursday, President Obama and his economic advisers started a locomotive of change. Instead of merely attempting to patch the ailing economy, this comprehensive budget plan promises to “rebuil[d] its foundations.” Saturated with spending projections for health care, carbon-emissions caps, and education, the budget also prudently identifies funding sources, turning what may have been a blunt instrument into a refined tool. In short, the budget is another excellent step toward economic recovery.
The proposed budget is a savvy political vehicle for reform. The federal budget process has two purposes. First, it provides “a financial measure of federal expenditures, receipts, deficits, and debt levels and their impact on the economy” in order to maintain both stability and growth. Second, it allocates the means to fund such objectives. Although these tall orders might ordinarily lead to filibuster for other legislation, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandates “fast-track” legislative procedures—limiting debate times and even restricting amendments based on relevancy—to protect against that. This means that Congress will have no choice but to confront the new and controversial policies in Obama’s proposal—many of which have been avoided otherwise.
Healthcare looms as one of the most controversial reforms in this package. Obama proposes to create a $634 billion “reserve fund for healthcare reform.” This national insurance program will spark some long overdue changes—like a national electronic platform for health-care records. Electronic records will make communication and exchange more convenient as well as reduce prescription errors, save lives, and reduce malpractice lawsuits. This efficiency will save taxpayers money in the long run and force modernization for hospitals that might not have otherwise done so. 
But while the mechanics of this new health-care system may be more efficient, the overall insurance plan may not be. Some argue that many remain uninsured because they simply decide not to buy insurance—perhaps because of young age, for example. To avoid paying for those who can afford insurance, Obama’s team should encourage Congress to include a market mandate, which would require Americans to opt in to plans they could afford. This would help to avoid subsidizing those who do not need subsidies.
On the environment, Obama’s cap-and-trade proposal is a market-friendly, politically palatable way to reduce carbon emissions. This solution will establish a finite number of pollution permits—and thus a finite cap on pollution—that companies would be required to buy and trade in an open market. Not only will this efficiently reduce carbon emissions, but the administration projects that it would raise $79 billion in revenue. Importantly, the flexibility of cap-and-trade should make it a politically viable alternative to solutions like the gas tax, which has faced undeserved popular and congressional opposition in the past.
With the projected $79 billion in cap-and-trade revenue, the Obama administration should support the development of clean, alternative energies.  Cap-and-trade will help reduce emissions, but it may not be enough to reach the budget’s goals of a 14-percent reduction below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050. Such drastic, long-term reductions will depend on a low-emission energy infrastructure for America, which can only be developed with alternative energy technology.
Another pillar of the budget’s fiscal reforms proposes to eliminate federal subsidies to farmers with sales revenues in excess of $500,000 per year and cap total individual subsidies for farmers at $250,000. Combined with other agricultural subsidy cuts, this would reduce farm subsidy expenditures by about $2 billion annually. This potential savings would be a boon for taxpayers. Furthermore, the inefficient subsidies currently create a price floor—a minimum price above market equilibrium—which artificially inflates prices, hurting American consumers. 
Education spending, another type of government subsidy, will also get a delayed tune-up under the budget proposal. In addition to spending more on education, Obama’s budget proposes to make student loans available directly from the federal government—rather than government-sponsored private intermediaries. Considering the scandal that has riddled this $85-billion-a-year industry, it makes sense for an uninterested lender like the federal government to help out college students. 
Accomplishing these radical changes will require unprecedented tax increases. Fortunately, the Obama administration has aimed these hikes at the right brackets—the top five percent of taxpayers and what some have called the “shadow banking industry,” namely hedge funds and private equity firms. Currently taxed at only capital gains rates, these money managers would now face income tax rates, yielding a projected $24 billion in tax revenue. Not only is this logical, since they earn their income through capital gains, but it is the right target in leveling the playing field for middle-class Americans.
The historic magnitude of this budget is undisputed. Nationalized health care, cap-and-trade emissions regulation, an end to some agricultural subsidies, government loans, and, of course, tax hikes would have each—let alone all—been unheard of three years ago. Yet desperate times call for bold measures, and the recession demands the policy reform and funding plans of this budget.

It’s not unheard of—a few weeks into the term, one realizes that shopping week was not representative of a class. Whether it’s because of the course’s content, the lecturer’s style, or the late realization that a 9 a.m. lecture just won’t happen, students often discover that they must reevaluate the classes on their study cards after they’ve been turned in. 
Last spring, I found myself in this very dilemma. Fortunately, Harvard’s add/drop system allows students to make additional changes after shopping week. And so, just before 5 p.m. on the third Monday of the term, I stopped by the registrar’s office to turn in an add/drop form. The woman who took it smiled and said, “Great! You just missed the fee!” This struck me as odd. Why would I be charged money to change my schedule?
I transferred to Harvard last spring, so maybe I was late to discover this particular bureaucratic tangle. I had first heard about the add/drop fee two weeks into my first semester here. But many students I’ve talked to either don’t realize there is a fee or don’t understand why it exists. The practice of charging students when they add or drop classes seems both financially unnecessary and potential harmful to students’ academic decisions; Harvard should not penalize its students for changing their schedules after an arbitrarily chosen Monday. If regulations allow students to change their schedules until the fifth Monday of the term—which they often do—then they should be able to do so free of charge. 
The financial justification for the fee is weak at best. Certainly, the cost of processing an add/drop form is nowhere near $10 per person. Moreover, it is unlikely that it costs nothing to process a schedule on the third Monday of a term but $10 to do so on the third Tuesday. Even supposing the administrative burden were that expensive, the College should draw this fee from the $32,000 in tuition it has already extracted from each student, presumably for such academic purposes.
Of course, some may argue that the $10 charge encourages students to make more prudent choices during shopping period. Indeed, students already have a generous amount of time to explore their class options. But those who argue that there is already sufficient time to pick classes miss the point.
It is possible that a student will find his or her class is a bad fit, even after the third Monday of the term. This student already faces an extremely difficult decision. Two weeks of makeup work is a daunting prospect for the average Harvard student. The other option—choosing to remain in the course—entails being trapped in a class that he or she dislikes. Given the gravity of this decision and the stress accompanying it, the administration should not be invoking a penalty that skews the student’s choice. 
Granted, for many the financial impact of $10 is relatively small. However, the fine stigmatizes the idea of changing one’s schedule. If the administration’s goal is to encourage prudent scheduling decisions, it should provide improved advising—not a fine.   
In general, Harvard’s add/drop system is extremely flexible, offering students opportunity to fine-tune their schedules long into the term. However, the fee for changing classes seems like an expendable vestige of past policies that should be allowed to wither away. Serving no reasonable financial purpose and attaching a stigma to changing classes after the third Monday of the term, Harvard’s $10 add/drop charge should be abolished. Like students at other schools, students here should not have to forgo a trip to the movies to alter their schedules.

This month, the world’s second largest pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, startled the drug industry and the public-health world by announcing a groundbreaking program intended to extend access to medicines for millions of people living in developing countries. GSK’s proposal is not a perfect solution: Millions of patients in middle-income countries, such as India and Brazil, will be left out of the deal. HIV research is also excluded from parts of the program, and even at reduced prices GSK products may remain out of reach for most patients in Least Developed Countries. Nevertheless, the announcement represents a remarkable willingness by a pharmaceutical company to change the way it does business in the developing world. 
The plan, announced by CEO Andrew Witty on February 13 in a speech delivered at Harvard Medical School, would limit prices in the 50 least developed countries and give back a portion of the profits gained in these countries toward programs to expand their health-care capacity. More surprisingly, GSK also announced that it would allow outside researchers access to some of its patented medical technologies in an effort to facilitate more research aimed at so-called “neglected diseases,” or diseases that currently suffer from a severe lack of research funding. 
Why can’t Harvard act more like “Big Pharma”? Ordinarily, it would seem strange to push Harvard to follow the lead of a for-profit corporation like GSK. The influence of pharmaceutical companies at universities is a controversial topic. We are often rightly cautioned that becoming too closely tied with industry may lead us to lose sight of our public interest mission. Yet when a major pharmaceutical company takes the lead in promoting access to medicines in developing countries, following Big Pharma would bring us more in line with our own core values as an educational nonprofit.
 As a research center, we carry out an important role in developing innovative health technologies that can have an enormous potential impact around the globe. Inventions produced today in Harvard laboratories may lead to revolutionary new treatments, not just for neglected diseases, but for conditions such as AIDS, heart disease, and cancer, which are problems for developing and developed countries alike. Publicly funded research, carried out at institutions like Harvard, produces key inputs to the drug development pipeline: In the past century, 15 out of the 21 most important therapeutic drugs were developed with public funds.
In spite of their important role in producing new drugs, universities have taken a back seat to pharmaceutical companies in determining the policy agenda for access to medicines. Patentable technologies created in universities are typically licensed to pharmaceutical companies to facilitate the development of useful, marketable end products. In addition to providing product development, these partnerships also frequently guarantee that the institution and the researcher will share in the profits through royalties. Yet, too often, the agreements used to create these partnerships contain no provisions preserving the rights of universities to grant access to the finished products. This means that, in most cases, health technologies created in Harvard labs will be priced out of reach for millions of people in developing countries. It also means that researchers wishing to build on Harvard’s work may be prevented from studying and improving upon the ideas forged by Harvard faculty.
There are better ways for Harvard to work with industry. Yale made headlines in 2001 when it partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb to jointly announce that they would permit the sale of low-priced generic drugs in South Africa, which led to a 96-percent reduction in the price of one first-line HIV treatment. More recently, the University of British Columbia has formalized a policy that will incorporate global access wherever possible into agreements with industry. These licensing policies for global access cost a negligible amount because markets in developing countries generate so little revenue. The benefits of these policies are significant: potentially life-saving interventions for millions of patients.
Global access licensing is not a burden on industry relations, and it is appealing for donors seeking to fund university research. For example, in the year following UBC’s implementation of its global access policy in 2007, UBC increased the number of new technologies licensed, industry funding remained steady, and research funding from all sources, including government and non-profit, increased by over 15 percent.
At Harvard, we have not yet developed a public and transparent global access policy, and our licensing agreements remain hit-or-miss. While a few individual researchers, working collaboratively with the Harvard Office of Technology Development, occasionally make the news with access-savvy agreements, most of Harvard’s closed-door licensing deals do not include terms for global access. In place of this patchwork approach, Harvard has the potential to implement a broad, forward-looking, and relatively cost-neutral licensing policy that would ensure appropriate access measures for the technology we create.
GSK has shown that industry is willing to re-envision the way it does business in developing countries. Instead of lagging behind, universities should be taking the lead in promoting policies in line with our public-interest mission. GSK’s announcement comes as a wake-up call for corporations engaging in medical research to recognize our responsibility to patients and the public. It presents a challenge to the entire Harvard community, including faculty, administrators, overseers, technology development officers, and students, to build a better access policy that will allow us to meet and surpass Big Pharma in the arena of good global citizenship.

Fans of evolution have reason to celebrate. The year 2009 is both the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species, which formally laid out his theory of evolution. Darwin’s discovery revolutionized the field of biology and laid the groundwork for countless future discoveries in anthropology, psychology, and medicine. Chances are, you found out about Darwin’s birthday well before reading this, because his face has been everywhere this winter, from the cover of National Geographic to the Queen’s Head Pub last month, where drinks were served and gorilla costumes worn in honor of the bicentennial. 
But evolution skeptics have reason to cheer as well, because the celebration of Darwin’s work among scientists and in the media will likely reignite the debate over whether evolution or creationism should be taught in schools. Creationists will point out that the Darwin love-fest among scientists amounts to little more than devotion to a religious leader, reinforcing the views of the nearly half of Americans who don’t believe in evolution anyway. The display in the Science Center prepared by the UK-based Darwin 200 in February seemed to anticipate this debate, as one of the panels debunks a list of creationist myths about evolution.
[See correction below.]Why would so many ordinary Americans reject something that is so overwhelmingly accepted by the people who study it? A simple clash between religion and science has often been posited as the answer, but the reality is more complicated, as evidenced by the large number of scientists who believe in both God and in evolution.
Evolution gets singled out because of its implications about the origin of human life. It is unintuitive, even for scientists, to accept that our species, which is unique in so many ways, has the same origins as a shark or a sequoia. But this does not account for why every single European country except Turkey is more willing than the U.S. to accept evolution as a fact. Presumably people in the EU care about what it means to be human, too.
One answer is that creationists in the United States are better organized and more effective at controlling the debate, taking advantage of some admittedly confusing aspects of evolution to cast a shadow of doubt over the whole field. 
Take the typical American creationist’s sneer: discrediting evolution by calling it “only a theory.” This misrepresents the concept of a theory in scientific discourse, which simply means an explanation. Plate tectonics, geometry, and even gravity are considered scientific theories. Calling evolution “only a theory” is also highly misleading because evolution is not only a theory but also a fact, in the words of the late Harvard biologist Stephen Jay Gould. We can observe the fact of evolution in populations of animals or plants that change even over a human lifetime, just as we can observe that bricks of different weights all hit the ground at the same time when chucked over the side of the leaning tower of Pisa.
Many American creationists also use other acts of verbal obfuscation. For instance, some attempt to spread the notion that there is a real debate among scientists between evolution and intelligent design and then encourage public schools to “teach the debate.” But among the most damaging tactics is to refer to those who accept evolution as Darwinists, because it feeds off the sense of awe many scientists genuinely feel toward Darwin. American creationists use it to imply that believers in evolution form little more than a religious sect, owing irrational fealty to a charismatic spiritual leader. It doesn’t help that the term Darwinism is actually used by scientists, although only to differentiate between early evolutionary hypotheses.
The idea that scientists have an irrational reverence for Darwin is false. His work is seen as incomplete at best: Darwin knew nothing about genes or DNA, and yet today it would be impossible to teach evolution without discussing them. Further, although Darwin developed his theory first, it was Alfred Wallace’s independent conclusions that finally spurred Darwin to publish his findings. 
Still, many scientists continue to honor Darwin, certainly out of honest admiration but perhaps also to reinforce the significance of his findings on evolution. But too much praise gives the general public the impression that scientists are all a bunch of Darwin-worshippers. It’s bad enough that books have just been published with titles like Darwin’s Sacred Cause by Adrian Desmond and James Moore, assessing Darwin’s abolitionist tendencies, or Angels and Ages, by Adam Gopnik, which compares Darwin to Lincoln. Worse, these views are often evangelized in the popular press. Even something as seemingly innocuous as putting a fish on your car with the word “Darwin” written inside it may suggest to the uniformed that Darwin is somehow the Jesus of atheism.
So how can you honor Darwin’s legacy without attracting the whiff of religious fanaticism? Point out simple inconsistencies in dinner-table debate. (Individuals don’t evolve, populations do.) Remind others that evolution is overwhelmingly uncontroversial among scientists. But, for crying out loud, don’t wax poetic about the genius of Charles Darwin or his noble purpose. You’d be doing your entire species a disservice.

In the sharpest reaction thus far to the recent decision putting the brakes on the University’s planned expansion into Allston, two professors in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology have considered leaving Harvard, fearing that fallout from the slowdown will harm their research. The University’s plans to deal with the slowdown by re-assigning MCB laboratory space to the stem cell researchers who were originally slated for Allston has raised concerns that basic biology research is being de-prioritized in the current financial crisis, according to several professors contacted by The Crimson last week. Those concerns have taken a toll, as professors in MCB have grown uneasy about their ability to continue their work amidst planning for the move and increasingly frustrated by their treatment at the hands of University administrators.Tom Maniatis, an MCB professor renowned for his work in molecular cloning, has made plans to leave Harvard to chair Columbia’s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, according to his lab administrator William C. McCallum. While Maniatis did not respond to repeated requests for comment last week, two colleagues confirmed that the University’s decision on Allston had cemented his departure plans. Once slated to become a centerpiece of the new Allston Science Complex as early as 2011, the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology will now occupy the Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building, uprooting the MCB researchers currently situated there. The impending move, likely to occur by summer, has already posed an “enormous distraction” to research, said one professor, whose laboratory, like that of Maniatis, is housed in Fairchild. The professor—who asked that he not be named in order to preserve his relationship with the University—said that he would certainly consider opportunities to leave Harvard in light of the disruption. MCB Professor Matthew Meselson, whose laboratory has been stationed in Fairchild for nearly 30 years, said that while he still awaits further details of the move from administrators, any decision hampering his research would be “very serious” and force him to confront senior University officials. The move out of Fairchild—which could take weeks—would also require lengthy consultation with architects and planners, according to several professors with laboratories in the building. To accommodate incoming stem cell researchers, Fairchild would have to be gutted and reconstructed. Faculty members also expressed concerns that the Northwest Science Building—the most likely destination for the displaced MCB laboratories—may provide inadequate facilities. Northwest was only completed last year and still features unpainted drywall and cement flooring in many rooms. “There are so many people [in Fairchild], so many labs full of equipment,” said MCB professor Guido Guidotti, who noted that the building had been constructed expressly for biochemical research. “Is there going to be comparable space? There probably is not.” Some MCB department members also said they were concerned that the University’s eviction of MCB faculty to make way for the stem cell department is indicative of a “corporatization” of science that comes at the cost of basic research. Meselson questioned the University’s prioritization of stem cell research, a highly specialized field that, he speculated, may not exist in 100 years. Jim Henle, a lab administrator in Fairchild, said he wrote a letter to University President Drew G. Faust criticizing the administration’s decision to relocate the MCB facilities and asking the renowned historian to envision an analogous situation facing her own department. “What I said was, imagine Robinson Hall getting an announcement that some hotshots from the Kennedy School are going to take over, because they’re in with Obama. The history department has to live in freshman dorms,” he said. “Okay, so they’ll still have a place to live, but it kind of sends a message,” Henle added. Several MCB department members in Fairchild said they were concerned by the administration’s failure to consult them regarding the logistics of the move. All news about the impending exodus has been relayed by top University administrators to Department Chair Catherine Dulac, allowing no faculty dialogue during the decision-making stages, the professors said. “It will be nice to have information directly from the administration rather than having me tell you what I am told by my chairman what the administration told her,” Guidotti said. “It’s somewhat of a roundabout way.” —Staff writer Esther I.

Gang activity is suspected in a case of vandalism at a Harvard Medical School building located in the school’s Longwood campus.According to a spokesman for the Boston Police Department, officers were dispatched to 641 Huntington Avenue, the location of the Harvard Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, at approximately 8 a.m. on Friday. Upon arrival, the officers spoke to an employee of the G. Greene Construction Co.—which is currently commissioned to renovate the building—who pointed out 11 separate tagging sites on the building. BPD spokesman Joseph Zanoli said that the vandalism is believed to have taken place between 6 p.m. on Thursday and 6 a.m. on Friday.The incident is currently being investigated by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC), which “focuses on the intersection of high impact criminal activities, locations, and people,” according to the Boston Police Department Web site.  Zanoli said that BRIC’s involvement with this case suggests that the incident was the result of gang activity.“It is an intelligence gathering unit and they primarily investigate gang-related crime,” Zanoli said. “The officer who was called there made some observations and decided it would best be investigated [by BRIC].”The building is part of the Longwood Medical Center, a group of medical and academic institutions—including Harvard Medical School—located in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.Representatives of G. Greene construction Co. could not be reached for comment. Members of the Medical School’s security office declined to comment on the vandalism.The building also houses Partners in Health, a Harvard-affiliated non-profit organization, but both the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine and Partners in Health are temporarily located at the Prudential Tower in downtown Boston for the 2008-2009 academic year due to the ongoing renovations.  —Staff writer Emily J.

Yesterday the Undergraduate Council voted unanimously to approve TKTS, a program through which the UC will raffle off free tickets every week to campus and local events. Last week the UC ran a trial run of the program and raffled off 32 tickets to both Cultural Rhythms and the Black Students Association’s Renaissance Ball. Nearly 200 students applied for tickets, according to Kia J. McLeod ’10, UC vice-president. “I feel like we are finding alternative ways to help social life without doing what we used to do in the past with the party fund. [We’re] just being creative,” McLeod said. UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said she thought the TKTS program was one of the most interesting ideas she advocated for while running for the presidency.“Out of many of my campaign issues, this is one of the most exciting,” she said. Next week the UC will be raffling off tickets for the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and Ghungroo, 58 and 16 tickets respectively.The program has been advertised over House e-mail lists. Students apply for the tickets by emailing uc.tkts@gmail.com, an account setup by the committee.  The requests are allocated by lottery and the recipients are notified by the Thursday before the event. The initiative and the recipients in the test run were announced over UC Weekly, a newsletter sent out by the Council. McLeod said she saw TKTS as a way to touch “many people across a wide spectrum.” The program, McLeod said, both encourages students to attend Harvard events and helps to fill seats that would otherwise remain vacant. The program’s name is a reference to a discount Broadway ticket service in New York City with the same name. Favia C. Merritt ’09 used a raffled-off ticket to attend the Renaissance Ball Friday night. “I think it’s an amazing program because I’ll go to more events if I can raffle for free tickets,” she said. Merritt said she would have attended the event even if the raffle did not exist. The UC also passed legislation at yesterday’s meeting allocating $500 toward the purchase of speakers. The speakers will replace an older system that is no longer functional. The speakers will be rented out to student groups.At the meeting the Council allocated more than $23,000 to 48 projects from the grants fund. More than $6,000 was allocated to five projects through the Student Life Fund.

Twelve students strapped on their walking shoes for a Food Literacy Project-led “Culinary Cambridge Walking Tour” on Saturday.The jaunt was led by FLP Administrator Theresa A. McCulla ’04, and included stops at chef Julia Child’s former home, Savenor’s Market, and locally-owned café, The Biscuit.McCulla said that the purpose of the tour was to introduce students to culinary points of interest in Cambridge. “It’s so easy to just stay on campus without realizing that you can find all this neat stuff,” McCulla said.Students said their interest in participating stemmed from a fascination with the preparation, taste, and presentation of different types of food.“I thought it would be a good way to see the cooking culture of Cambridge,” said Jimmy C. Yang ’09, who took classes in French and Italian cooking last summer.The first stop was the former home of chef Julia Child—credited with popularizing French cuisine among an American audience—on 103 Irving St., just a few blocks east of the Science Center.Although the students could not enter the historic three-story abode, as it is now a private residence, they circulated a photograph of Child’s kitchen, which was moved in its entirety to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. three years before her death in 2004. Two blocks away on Kirkland St., students took a tour of Savenor’s Market, the butcher shop and grocer frequented and made famous by Child.Students went behind-the-scenes at the butchering station, learning about the preparation of the store’s famed meats, which range from the ordinary—chicken and pancetta—to the exotic—llama, black bear, and Brazilian python.General Manager Juliana Lyman offered a tasting of Savenor’s gourmet products: maple smoked salmon with crème fraiche on water wheel crackers, goat cheese on crusty baguette slices, and freshly seared prime rare strip steak—all washed down with Pellegrino and Poland Spring mandarin orange sparkling water.“This isn’t what they serve in your cafeteria,” laughed Lyman.The final stop on the tour was nearby café The Biscuit, where students sampled sandwiches, pastries, coffees, and teas—all on the FLP’s tab.The FLP aims to “[cultivate] an understanding of food from the ground up,” according to its Web site.“This place is really cute,” said Sarah T. Yang ’10 as she sipped a café au lait, adding that she might come back if she needed a place to study.

The Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance voted unanimously yesterday to change the organization’s name to the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies.
The board sent an e-mail to the organization’s open list about the possibility of a name change last week, spurring a passionate debate comprising over 50 e-mails about the proposed renaming.
But despite the fervor and length of the e-mail responses, few QSA members who were not on the board attended yesterday’s open board meeting, and no objections to the new name were raised at that time.
“The majority of the objections were from gay men who weren’t involved in BGLTSA,” said QSA co-chair Marco Chan ’11. In contrast, the women who responded tended to support the change, according to QSA Secretary Christian L. Garland ’10.
In an online poll of the QSA membership, a slight majority of the 99 voters supported changing the name to QSA. But the vote of general members was not material to the actual name change, which only required unanimous agreement among board members. 
Most of those who objected on the e-mail list specifically cited their disapproval of using the word queer. But at the meeting, board members emphasized that the gay community is increasingly embracing the term.
“For those students who are coming to Harvard for the first time and have negative connotations of the word queer, I think having Queer Students and Allies will help reclaim the word,” Garland said.
Using the word “queer” isn’t new for the QSA—as their Web site URL, www.hcs.harvard.edu/~queer, has included the word for years.
The change is intended to make the organization’s name more inclusive, according to Chan.
QSA Co-Chair Rogelio J. Mercado, Jr. ’10 provided the example of an e-mail he once received from an asexual prefrosh who was unsure about whether the QSA—then the BGLTSA—would welcome asexuals. 
“We want to open it up so anyone who might identify as queer or an ally can feel like the name includes them and addresses them,” Chan said.

Frances R. Cardullo—the owner of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe whose passion for food, travel, and the Red Sox made her an icon in Harvard Square—died last Wednesday at the age of 68.Born in Winchester, Mass., Cardullo—who underwent a gender reassignment surgery recently and identified as female—grew up in Cambridge and attended Tufts University. She earned a flying license at an early age and worked as a contract pilot for two decades before returning to take over the store, which had been founded by her father in 1950.According to Cardullo’s daughter, Donez J. Cardullo-Tavilla, Cardullo “literally traveled all over the world,” bringing back “true delicacies” that could not be found anywhere in America.Cardullo-Tavilla added that her warmest memories of Cardullo involved “food, food, food.” She said her father was a devoted food connoisseur who always insisted on using the best ingredients.“It was unheard of to have a frozen dinner, to have Wonder bread, or Chips Ahoy cookies,” she said.Cardullo-Tavilla added that Cardullo’s commitment to quality earned her the respect of not only Harvard Square and the Cambridge community, but also the entire food industry.“My father was some sort of food god,” she said.Cardullo’s colleagues said they would remember her generosity.“Whenever she was asked to help the association, you always knew that she would say yes,” said John P. DiGiovanni, president of the Harvard Square Business Association.  Cardullo-Tavilla added that if someone came into the store with only five dollars, her father would make sure the customer got a sandwich that was worth his money.DiGiovanni also said that he admired Cardullo’s courage, especially in her decision to undergo a sex change late in life.“I received a letter she sent out a letter to many folks explaining why she was making the decision she made,” DiGiovanni said. “She sent it with a gift, a nice bottle of wine or champagne with a letter explaining what was happening,”Cardullo-Tavilla said that dealing with the transition was difficult at times, but she and her siblings accepted their father’s decision because they wanted Cardullo to be happy.“Wearing a dress or wearing pants he was always our father,” Cardullo-Tavilla said.Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, also praised Cardullo for her courage, and said that it was “profoundly unfair” that her colon cancer diagnosis—which occurred in 2007—came so soon.But Cardullo-Tavilla said she and her siblings, who have assumed responsibility of the store, will continue to uphold Cardullo’s spirit and traditions—especially broadcasting Red Sox games in the TV screen in the store’s front window.“Instead of my father sitting outside watching the games it will be myself and my son in his place,” she said.

Eliot House Master and Romance Language prof Lino Pertile probably prefers Renaissance French literature to organized crime, and there have been no reports of bloody horse heads in the bedsheets of Eliot residents—but Pertile is, in fact, Italian. The natural corollary, then, seems to be that the Don of Eliot can be compared to a mafioso and potentially emblazoned as such on the House t-shirt.
But one Eliot resident took issue with the t-shirt design depicting Pertile as Vito Corleone, complete with the caption "The Housemaster."  The Godfather, the resident wrote on the house list, portrays a "rather romanticized notion of mob violence that has helped propagate the stereotype associating Italians with violent crime." In other words, the mafia likes to kill people, and Pertile is certainly not the man for the job (he'd rather take a stab at Dante's Inferno, thank you very much, after the jump):
Now, these comparisons are a bit weak, and considering the myriad of nonsensical house t-shirts that have made their way onto the bosoms of many Harvard students, we don't think the tenuous relationship between Pertile and Corleone is a cause for concern. The real issue seems to be, is a comparison to Corleone necessarily a bad thing? Also, the t-shirt's a joke, if you didn't notice (via the Eliot list):
Anyways, Pertile himself supposedly cleared the  Godfather shirt ahead of time—and he "loved" it.  Just make sure he doesn't venture unaccompanied through any tollbooths or cornfields until housing day is over.

With a reporter’s notebook surreptitiously tucked into my bag, I trekked down to Hillel on Saturday night to infiltrate its first ever speed-dating event.
I got there a little after 9, and the line to get in was out the door. (About 100 to 130 people showed up, according to an unofficial count.) Crowded in with the other latecomers, I jotted down some of their reactions:
“Look, there ARE guys here!” Surprisingly, there were. The ratio of guys to girls was pretty balanced, although most girls showed up much earlier than the guys.
“We have to pay to get into this?” Yes, each attendee was charged 3 dollars, which all went to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
“I guess everyone is desperate.” Lucky for the homeless shelter.
Finally, the speed dating began. Each of us had a nametag with a number, and a sheet of paper to write down the names of the people we met and whether we wanted to see them again. I soon discovered that I would need to shout the entire time because the room was so loud. At least I didn’t have anyone take advantage of this as an excuse to invade my personal space. Some girls (see photo) were not so lucky.
Ultimately, the guys I met fell into the following three categories:
1) The awkward but affable undergrads. They were either from Harvard, BU, or Northeastern. Some wore yarmulkes, some not. Most were from New York or Boston and were studying economics, science, or math. A few tried to start with jokes, but unfortunately, none of these were memorable enough to be repeated here. They smiled a lot and asked me why I had left California to go to school at Harvard. None of them asked me if I was a Jew.
2) The unexpected grad students. Apparently, the age limit was 26, which I suppose I would have known had I read the email invite more carefully. Some of them looked old enough to make me feel kind of weirded out. Definitely not kosher.
3) The frat pledges. I was informed by an anonymous source to look for these, but really, they were easy to spot. They were too slick for Hillel, too self-congratulatory and full of freshman bravado. They also had name tags that read “Dirt” and “Mango.” When asked, most good-naturedly admitted to being there facetiously. One, though, denied it and instead waxed BS about his love for girls’ feet. In response, I asked him what he thought of his own feet. He didn’t have a good answer for that.

You thought winter was over? Yeah, that's what we thought when we saw the Dunster igloo—for a while the grand fixture of the courtyard—reduced to this pathetic little mess two days ago:
But as of today, the snow is back—and it'll probably be around for the next day or so. Supposedly, today's snowstorm is "just a tease for what's coming tonight." We're talking 10 to 15 inches, and a snowfall rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour around midnight.
For Dunster residents brave enough to undertake another project of such monumental scale: we assure you that your igloo, like its predecessor, will die a natural death (namely, a lot of sunlight and warmth). So stay away, hockey players.

For an edifice as large as the behemoth known as Northwest Science Building, the activity level Friday afternoon was surprisingly close to nil. Didn’t these people have some research to do?
Thankfully, we found these buttoned-down lab rats did in fact have their priorities straight—they were focusing on alcohol and mountains of Doritos. The FAS Center for Systems Biology, a collaborative research unit whose members occupy Northwest, holds happy hours every Friday at 5 pm, and we were lucky enough to stumble upon a coagulated mass of biology researchers “socializing” as they knocked back Coronas and forgot that their shoelaces were still tied (more on the Northwest scene after the jump).
It was raging, to say the least. We struck up a conversation with the director of research Bodo Stern, who had consumed at least one bottled blend of hops and barley by the time we started discussing the possible move-in to Northwest of MCB professors and their labs currently located in Fairchild Biochemistry Building down the street.
Stern was a fan of the idea, calling it "perfect." Though he understands that the move may be disruptive for the MCB people, Stern thinks "it's great to have stem cell researchers here."
He paused sagely. "I think it's going to be fun." After all, alcohol never impaired anyone, including professors...right? Right.
