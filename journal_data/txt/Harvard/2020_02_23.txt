After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After five and a half years, Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s fantastic creation, “BoJack Horseman” — the genre-redefining adult cartoon — has come to an end. The final season’s sincere portrayal of mental health dotted with clever jokes, tongue twisters, and running animal gags will win the hearts of many.
Picking up after the dramatic Season Five finale, BoJack (Will Arnett) checks into rehab at Pastiches where Diane (Alison Brie) dropped him off after his interview with Biscuits Braxby (Daniele Gaither) about a choking incident with Gina Cazador (Stephanie Beatriz). Afterwards, BoJack does not return to the same reckless and self-destructive horseman he has been in previous seasons.
Throughout the season, BoJack comes to terms with all the terrible things he’s done, but one seems to haunt him the most: the death of Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal). The flashbacks come again and again. The starry sky that she and BoJack saw in the planetarium before she died is right there on the intro to every episode and creeps into multiple scenes throughout the season as a constant reminder of the event. It is little details like this that give the animation of the show its narrative power.
The mystery of Sarah Lynn’s death even gets its own couple of investigative journalists, Paige Sinclaire (Paget Brewster) and Maximillian Banks (Max Greenfield), a witty pair taken straight from the 1930s whose only function in the show is to unveil the secrets behind the death of the young pop star. They’re entertaining, and while they barely fit into the overall arc of the show, they manage to not be disruptive; the fact that “Bojack Horseman” is a silly cartoon precludes that. And it works perfectly to inadvertently move the plot of BoJack’s transformation forward, which is the central focus of the season.
In this season, the characters’ lives start to settle down. Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) struggles to maintain her highly productive work life while taking care of her daughter, while Todd (Aaron Paul) untangles his complicated relationship with his parents and Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins) deals with his overwhelming guilt of cheating on his now fiancée. Old conflicts are resolved while others get uncovered, and the weight of the previous seasons sets in.
It’s often difficult to feel the passage of time in cartoons, but in “BoJack Horseman,” characters are not renewed every time the outro theme plays. All the challenges they endure do not go away. The characters are visibly tired of screwing up like they have done in the past. In each episode of Season Six, they attempt to make things a little better, amend their mistakes, and redeem themselves. The fact that the characters are able to age and mature across the seasons, in addition to the realistic themes, makes for an almost novel-like experience.
As fans have seen before, the show does not hesitate to explore dark subjects. In this season, however, the dark themes are no longer spiraling out of control, nowhere near as chaotic, random, or exaggerated as seasons past. The conflicts we see are somehow getting closer and closer to reality as our characters, more than ever before, just want to find a bit of solace in their lives. The protagonists are now facing the responsibilities they previously ignored. The clock is ticking for everyone. In the second part of the season, BoJack’s hair becomes gray, and one can’t help but think that time is running out for the horseman. Certainly, he is thinking about it.
Many shows in adult animation can be closely analyzed for some deeper meaning. Most of them try to deal with issues in adult life, even if it's just to make jokes out of them. In shows like “Rick and Morty” and “Big Mouth,” creators are less shy about letting these themes come into the spotlight. But unlike its contemporaries, “BoJack Horseman” made the darkest themes of adult life the most important piece of its narrative. Instead of using them as a reference for jokes or burying them in complex exaggerated plots or making them the subject of spare monologues, these subjects are all over “BoJack.” They are the plot, the humor, and the animation. “BoJack Horseman” is actively elaborating on the hardest subjects of adult life instead of just hinting at them.
The truth is that words cannot do justice to this show. Its ability to package difficult, complex issues in a digestible, hilarious package is incredible. The way each episode can be so heart wrenching and silly at the same time is a magic that no other format could hope to have. This show defies classical narratives as it never seems to provide us closure. Each episode is a slap across the face without an apology. No wrap ups. No grand finale. But no other words could say it better than those of the brilliant writers of the show:
“Life’s a bitch, and then you die, right?”
“Sometimes… sometimes life’s a bitch, and then you keep living.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colleen A. McGuinness ’99 is a writer, director, and producer extraordinaire known for her work on “30 Rock,” “Friends From College,” “Love Bites,” and “About a Boy.” The Emmy, Producers Guild of America, and Writers Guild nominated writer and Long Island native sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss her diverse comedic inspirations, her writing process, and her favorite memories from writing for “30 Rock.”
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you become inspired to write for TV?
Colleen A. McGuinness: I started out being signed by the film department of an agency, and I had written a film and shot a short film. I’ve always loved movies, but I also always loved TV too. I had a bunch of student loans — thank you, Harvard — and some credit card bills, and I was really struggling to make ends meet. It just seemed like, because TV has to go on the air every week, things were moving quicker, so I met with TV agents and got my first job writing for television. There’s so much great TV that I love. When I first started writing, I wrote a sort of light dramatic feature — I don’t call it a dramedy because I don’t love that word — but the very first thing that I really wrote was a short film that was a comedy. It was not a true story, but it was about a girl in college who thinks that her roommate may have walked in on her while she was masturbating. So it’s a little bit of a detective story and as she’s asking around, she’s also hearing different viewpoints about sex and about what people believe is “normal.” I think that a lot of great comedy comes from shame and embarrassment and humiliation.
THC: Did you grow up loving comedy?
CAM: I’ve always loved comedy. I remember one of the first shows that I really watched, that I was allowed to watch — because I was raised by my grandparents, who were pretty strict about television — was “Family Ties.” And when I was in middle school, I would watch “Saturday Night Live” every weekend, then “Friends” and “Seinfeld” came along, and I would memorize scenes from “Seinfeld” and act them out with my friends. I also loved a lot of old comedies — there’s a Jack Lemmon movie called “The Out of Towners.” I loved “The Philadelphia Story” and “Annie Hall” — there are a lot of older comedies that I grew up watching and I think they all pointed me in that direction.
THC: What have been your favorite and most personally meaningful projects so far?
CAM: It’s funny because while you’re working on a project, it feels like it’s the most meaningful. I would say that in some ways [the answer is] the first film and the first feature that I wrote, which was about a guy who kind of gets stuck on Long Island and whose dad has died and he is smoking a lot of pot and isn’t going anywhere until he meets this younger girl who he starts tutoring. It’s this impossible romance because of their age gap. It was a really personal project and I think, just because they were the first two things that I wrote, they felt extremely meaningful. I was really learning to find my voice and make myself vulnerable and put myself out there. I really try to find a personal angle before I take anything on, and anytime I don’t fully have that, I never feel as good about what I’m writing. So it’s something that’s kind of necessary for me at this point. But while I’m tackling it I can find a real connection to it, and I can draw from my own life while I’m writing it.
THC: What TV shows have been your biggest inspirations, and what are your favorite shows now?
CAM: I love “Fleabag,” “Russian Doll,” “Killing Eve,” “Atlanta,” and then growing up, like I said, “Family Ties,” “Seinfeld,” and “Friends.” I also really loved “Twin Peaks.” That was a huge show for me. I just couldn’t believe that this was a television show. It seemed like a movie and was very cinematic and I just couldn’t sleep watching it — it scared me, it moved me, it was so beautiful. I also loved “The Sopranos,” and later I wound up being very influenced by “Arrested Development.” Before I wrote on it, I really loved “30 Rock” as well.
THC: What are some of your favorite memories from your time writing on “30 Rock”?
CAM: We had Kermit the Frog in [one] episode, and I was always a huge fan of the Muppets. One of the things that I loved about “30 Rock” was that, especially at that stage, we really did some crazy stuff. I remember being in the rewrite room on that episode, and at some point, someone pitched that Kermit was at [Colleen’s] funeral, and it went in the script. Sometimes we would just throw crazy things in and then take them out. I remember saying to Robert Carlock, who’s a Harvard grad, and who also ran the show with Tina — “Kermit’s really gonna do it, like we’re really going to try to get Kermit?” And he was like, “I don’t see why not!” And apparently it was a big process to get Kermit — he’s really tough to get through to, and the funny thing is that he almost didn’t come because of [Hurricane Sandy], so at a certain point his plane was delayed and everyone was waiting. But I have to tell you that when Kermit and his operator, Steve, showed up, people went bananas. And this is a crew and cast who saw pretty huge guest stars on a regular basis — there were a lot of great people who passed through “30 Rock” — but definitely Kermit the Frog was one of the most exciting guest stars that we had. Everyone got on line to take a picture with Kermit during their lunch hour.
THC: What is your favorite “30 Rock” episode of all time?
CAM: As for my favorite episode, I sort of have three. My first favorite is “Rosemary’s Baby.” It’s a lot of people’s favorite, I think, and I think Tina thinks it’s one of the best ones, too. I remember I wasn’t writing for the show at the time and I was just so blown away by that episode. I also love Carrie Fisher. The other one that really stuck out in my head was “Tracy Does Conan.” That episode came along in the first season, and I remember I was watching the show, and I was into it, but that episode came along and I was like, “Oh my gosh, this is another level.” It was one of the first episodes that really showed what “30 Rock” could do. It takes a while when you’re writing a show for all the elements to come together and I felt like they pulled everything together really brilliantly on that episode. The other one that I really love is one that Matt Hubbard won an Emmy for, which is “Reunion,” where you find out that [Liz Lemon (Tina Fey)] was not the bullied one — she was actually the mean girl in high school. The whole thing is kind of a “Carrie” rip off. Something I love that we could do on “30 Rock” was that we could parody other movies and TV shows.
THC: What is your writing process like? Where do you start?
CAM: It’s never the same exact way — I’ll have an idea or think of a character or think of a memory or experience that I had, maybe, or read an article. Inspiration can come from anywhere, and I’ll kind of think about it for a while and kind of play with the idea, and see if it holds my interest. If it starts to hold water and I’m still excited and I’m finding new ideas to build on that original idea, then at some point I’ll start to see how scenes will play out, and I’ll start to write things down. If it’s for a TV show, I’ll usually pitch it, in which case I’ll still have to flesh it out as a pitch, and I’ll come up with themes and characters and potential stories and potential arcs. If it’s a movie, I’ll write an outline — I’ll start to think, “What’s the first, second, and third act? How can I break this down into scenes?” — things like that. One of the other things I’ll do is run it by somebody. I find that to be really helpful, too. I’ll start to toss ideas out and when you’re talking, you start to realize things just on your own. Sometimes my husband will just listen and I’ll kind of talk myself into a direction. But everything’s different. The most important thing is to have your butt in the chair and just start getting stuff down.
THC: What have your experiences been like as a writer in comedy and do you have any advice for other women looking to break into comedy writing in general?
CAM: The last show that I wrote on was called “Stargirl.” It’s based on a comic book and created by Geoff Johns, and it was the first time — and I’ve been doing this for a while — that I’ve ever written on a show where there were more [women than men] in the room. And I was like, “It finally happened!” It was a male showrunner who did that on purpose and hired more women because we had a female lead character. It was really cool. For the most part, I’ve been on a lot of shows where there’s not a lot of women, but I do think that there are efforts being made to change that, and I think there are slightly more female showrunners than there were 10 years ago. I’ve been really fortunate to work for a number of showrunners like Tina, and some others who’ve been really great, like Liz Heldens. I think that’s part of the advice I would give to women starting out: It’s great to work for a female showrunner. But it’s also great to work for a male showrunner if he’s a good showrunner. I think that ultimately, you just have to commit to doing this no matter what. You try to find rooms that are receptive and warm to what you have to offer — you try to work with good people. You just have to put your voice out there and do your best and just hope that as you get to know other female writers and support each other, hopefully there will be more of a [tide change]. And I really think that’s starting to happen.
THC: After writing features and producing on shows, where do you hope to go next in your career?
CAM: I finished a Film Independent Directing Lab, and I’m actually the only woman in it, so I hope that more women apply next year. But there’s a movie that I wrote that I’m going to direct. Through the program, you get to workshop your film, and shoot a couple of scenes from the movie, and that was a really great learning experience. So I think next, I’d like to direct my movie.

“Cleanness” is a testament to writing as an art form, proof that sometimes beauty lies in the technical details. In his sophomore novel, Garth Greenwell writes sentence upon sentence that shimmer with truth, with desire, with shame. It’s a meandering novel — it contains more rumination than active plot — although the short sections and well-written prose keep the story flowing. But this may not be the book for everyone: While it offers a thoughtful look at an American abroad in Bulgaria, “Cleanness” takes a turn toward the graphic.
There is something harmonious about the symmetry of “Cleanness.” Divided into nine chapters of roughly the same length, split evenly amongst three sections, the novel is forced into a sense of structural cohesion despite the fact that chapters jump around in time. The first and final chapters focus on the narrator’s interactions with his students outside of school, where his identity as a queer man in a non-BGLTQ-friendly country becomes more prominent and he blunders in his role as a mentor. In the first, he fails to console a student who is heartbroken after coming out to his best friend and first love. When his words fall flat, the narrator laments, “That’s the worst thing about teaching, that our actions either have no force at all or have force beyond all intention ... that the consequences echo across years and silence, we can never really know what we’ve done.” The final chapter circles back to his past students as the narrator spends a night out with some students he used to teach and oversteps his boundaries dancing in the club and staring at the urinals. The chapters bookend the novel in a beautiful way, showcasing the reality of the teacher who is still learning how to be himself.
The second and penultimate chapters exhibit a similar mirroring: Both graphically depict sexual encounters with men the narrator meets online, but in the early chapter the narrator is submissive until he flees out of worry for his safety whereas in the later chapter the narrator plays the dominant role. Early on the narrator relishes being beaten by the larger man but quickly realizes, “I couldn’t bear to return to the helplessness I thought I had wanted.” When the roles are reversed, the narrator is ashamed of how much he enjoyed causing his sexual partner pain, he covers his face “which was wet with tears.” The novel comes full circle as the narrator investigates both the shame and the pleasure he feels playing submissive and dominant roles during sex.
Where the novel truly shines is its middle (and only titled) section, “Loving R.” Each of the three chapters explores the narrator’s relationship with R., a student — although not the narrator’s — who has not yet come out. Greenwell writes brilliant prose when R. is at a chapter’s center. The narrator thinks about saying goodbye to R.: “I struggled against it; he was worth struggling for … as was the person I found I was with him.” Even the sex scenes end with a tenderness the others in this novel lack, as the narrator thinks, “I love you, anything I am you have use for is yours.” These chapters are full of longing and love, but they also provide a wonderful lens — that of a couple of foreigners in love exploring the cities of Europe — that the other chapters lack.
Unfortunately, the book lacks cohesion and ambiguity abounds throughout. After all, no one is ever given a name: Instead, everyone is referred to by a first initial. The chapters skip around and provide only the roughest sketch of the narrator’s life during his time in Bulgaria. At times, the book feels more like a collection of loosely connected short stories than a singular narrative. Despite the very intimate descriptions — both of body and of mind — it is easy to feel distant from the R.’s and M.’s and Z.’s of the narrator’s social world.

Echosmith, the sibling trio known for radio hits “Cool Kids” and “Bright,” took their “Lonely Generation” tour to Boston’s Paradise Rock Club this past Valentine’s Day. Although the show was part of their first album tour as a band and only their second headlining tour, Echosmith graced the stage with ease and an awkward charm.
Fans of all ages filled the balcony and pit of the venue for an extended night of music. Many also appeared to be fans of the L.A. rock band, Weathers, who opened the show along with popular YouTuber Jayden Bartels. Weathers sustained a high energy set with neon hair flipping and shredding guitar solos. Their top streamed song “Happy Pills” inspired a crowd sing along, and their lyrical dance moves to “I’m Not OK” had the whole pit jumping. Jayden Bartels, a 15 year old singer-songwriter, played three original songs and covered Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” at the end of her set. The young artist was emblematic of Echosmith’s early start — lead singer Sydney Sierota was the same age, a sophomore in high school, when “Cool Kids” was first written. Still, Echosmith continued to bring their own youthful energy to the stage.
Echosmith’s set began with an extended intro to “Love You Better,” settling into the minor key shifts that drive the pulsing beats of the track, while the band members stood waiting in the shadows. The stage was multi-leveled with keyboard and soundboards raised in the back of the stage. Standing bass drums surrounded the floor, foreshadowing an epic drumbeat finale.
Wearing a pink jumpsuit and multicolored blue denim suit, respectively, lead singers and siblings Sydney and Noah Sierota were the first to step on stage. Their bright colored ‘70s outfits broadcasted their optimistic energy and certainly suited the Valentine’s holiday. Sydney immediately began interacting with the crowd, reaching out for hands in the front row as she bounced around the stage. She and Noah stayed close to the crowd the entire night, and even exited the stage directly into the crowd after the show. From their hand holding to their direct conversations with fans after the show, Echosmith’s performance was characterized by their connection to the audience.
After a warm welcome and formal introduction to the “Lonely Generation” Tour, Echosmith rattled through four more songs. Although Sydney and Noah remained energetic, a monotony developed from the simple, stagnant light effects and the neglect of both levels of the stage. The mood shifted during their more popular single “Over My Head,” and the band gained momentum with more interactive crowd elements. During “Lost Somebody,” Sydney caught and tossed back a tambourine for each chorus. After she dropped the first throw, the whole crowd cheered when Sydney got back on her game and even praised the stagehand making the throws.
The show was riddled with interludes where Sydney expressed the band’s love for Boston and their fans. Mid-set, the Sierotas’ mother came on stage to take a group picture of the band and audience. Sydney said “squeeze together,” as if inviting the audience into the family, optimistic the entire venue would fit in an iPhone frame. Their next song, “Bright,” with its warm, romantic mood, was a significant moment for the Valentine’s couples in the audience. For the single fans, Echosmith made sure to say they could be the band’s Valentine.
When introducing the back half of the set, Sydney talked about the importance of vulnerability for the band in their new album, and how they’ve written about feeling like an outsider since their start. Every action performed on stage seemed to send their message of love and inclusion to the audience.
Valentine’s Day also marked the release of Echosmith’s music video for “Follow You,” a song Sydney wrote as a wedding gift for her husband just weeks before their marriage. Sydney went on to perform an acoustic version of the song alone on stage.
The final sequence of songs brought the energy again to a high, and paid homage to the band’s humble beginnings performing covers as they played Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Stop Now.” Sydney took time to introduce the band, her brothers, and guitarist Jacob Evergreen, who replaced eldest brother Jamie when he stepped away from the band to care for his child. Sydney gave heartfelt speeches for each of the brothers, a sister happy to be living her dream alongside family.
Finally, the last song of the set, “Stuck,” utilized the ominous bass drums around the stage with the three siblings slamming the drum heads in unison. Fans didn’t have to scream long for the band to come back out for their two song encore. Celebrating the album, Echosmith performed their titular track, “Lonely Generation,” before the long awaited 2013 hit “Cool Kids.” Sydney took time to tell the story of “Cool Kids,” the feelings of exclusion and sadness she felt as a high schooler. To close out the night, she invited all who’d ever feel left out to raise their voices and let those feelings go.

On Feb. 14, Saint Motel — an indie pop band consisting of A/J Jackson on vocals and piano, Aaron Sharp on lead guitar, Dak Lerdamornpong on bass, and Greg Erwin on drums — made a tour stop at The Royale. The group is touring in support of their most recent project, “The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: Part 1,” the first installment in an upcoming trilogy of releases that together will compose a complete album. The first batch of fresh music that the group has put out since 2016’s edgy yet whimsical “saintmotelevision,” these five new tracks — “Old Soul,” “Sisters,” “Van Horn,” “Diane Mozart,” and “Save Me” — prove Saint Motel’s enduring knack for infusing both lyrics and instrumentation with effortless vivacity.
The concert began abruptly with a triumphant swell of music not unlike the orchestral theme that heralds the 20th Century Fox logo at the start of a film, immediately hushing the crowd’s casual chatter as if everyone had been transported into an actual cinema. After a brief pause, scenic footage ripped straight from a National Geographic documentary started scrolling across the many screens positioned artfully across the stage set. A deep, booming narrator’s voice filled the venue and spared no theatrics in proclaiming the night’s show as “a cinematic voyage through imagination.” This dramatic framing of Saint Motel’s live performance came as no surprise — after all, the band is nothing if not experimental, as evidenced by the 360-degree virtual reality music videos they created for each of the tracks on the record “saintmotelevision.” The atmosphere of boldness bordering on humorous chaos generated frenzied excitement before the band played a single note.
A/J Jackson, an uncontrollably expressive performer who couldn’t help but talk with his hands, was among the show’s highlights. During the extended instrumental intro to “For Elise,” he motioned as if conducting an invisible orchestra. In the opening bars of “Move,” he swept a hand sensuously over his shoulder, acting out the lyrics as he drawled them: “One look, one touch of a hand / can set the spiral in motion.” With intimate, physical gestures, Jackson turned his performance into something private and earnest, like the experience of listening to an old friend tell a story. But for all the theatrics displayed at the beginning of the show, the actual music played by Saint Motel was refreshingly free of affectation. From the conversational cadence of Jackson’s voice to the way Aaron Sharp rocked back and forth as he strummed the guitar, there seemed to be no barrier shielding the performers’ emotions from the audience.
A certain aura of uncool coolness, or perhaps cool uncoolness, permeates the way the band members carry themselves and perform their music. The 2000s emo vibe evoked by Saint Motel’s unfortunate wardrobe of short-sleeve tees and vests is well balanced with their tongue-in-cheek take on themes of young love in lyrics like “You could yell ‘Piss off! Won’t you stay away?’ / It’ll still be sweet talk to my ears” from the track “Sweet Talk.” Very rarely do Saint Motel songs hit a sharp emotional or dynamic climax. For the most part their music starts at a moderate level of energy — right at the cusp of where it’s acceptable to either simply bob your head or break it down on the dance floor — and stays there all the way until the reverberation of the last note has disappeared.
All through the night, Saint Motel’s body of work proved itself to be irresistibly danceable, capturing the spirit of youth in all its brash, gleeful self-indulgence. Many of their greatest hits, such as “My Type” and “Move,” are punctuated with bright bursts from brass instruments and sharp claps. Even the few relatively slower pieces scattered in the setlist, such as “Old Soul,” possess the same relentless, upbeat rhythm that refuses to be tamed even in the presence of dreamy background vocals and breathy adlibs.
Between the campy effort to frame the show as a cinematic experience, the little canoe strung with lights upon which Jackson crowd-surfed across the pit, and the person in a full-body dinosaur suit that danced alongside the band during their encore, it might seem like Saint Motel is trying too hard to do too much at once. Surprisingly, however, the theatrics that set the show apart from an ordinary concert never came across as a cheap ploy for attention but rather seemed a genuine manifestation of their chaotic energy. Both the audience and the band members themselves relished Saint Motel’s exaggerated references to cinema and self-aware quirkiness. The visual mayhem only complimented the effervescent, time-transcendent experience of their music that was somehow perfectly fitting for both the fickle teenager in the throes of their rebellious phase and the middle-aged couple looking for an vibrant backdrop to their date night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Trailing for much of the first half to a hungry Quakers side, the Harvard men’s basketball team rallied in a second-frame offensive flurry to complete its weekend sweep. Combined with a 2-0 weekend against Columbia and Cornell last weekend, Harvard now sits second at 7-3 in conference play and separates itself from both Penn and Brown in the Ivy standings.
Both senior forward Chris Lewis and sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood notched 19 points, but this 69-65 victory was largely a complete team effort. First-years Idan Tretout and Chris Ledlum provided energetic minutes off the bench, while senior guard Justin Bassey added a dozen onto the scoring sheet.
“The theme for us going into this weekend was the little things, little things make big players and lead to big wins,” Amaker said. “...We knew Penn was wounded coming in here [after Friday’s loss to Dartmouth]. I thought our guys were up for the challenge and the big second half was a tremendous effort by our entire team.”
The contest, held over Alumni and Junior Parents Weekend, was the second consecutive sell-out at Lavietes Pavilion. Prominent Harvard Basketball alumni in attendance included Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. More importantly for Crimson fans, this marks the 10th straight home win this season and Harvard needs just two more victories against Brown and Yale to cap off a perfect regular season mark at home.
“I think this weekend just meant a lot more to us, regardless if it was home or away,” Kirkwood said. “We really needed these two wins and I think it just made it better that it was home... I think we just have a little bit of extra energy as a team to really show up for our fans and supporters.”
The competition served as a potential preview to the back-and-forth excitement of the postseason tournament — no team lead by more than eight points, while the two rivals jabbed for 11 total lead changes. Collectively, the Quakers shot significantly better from deep (10-of-25 compared to Harvard’s 4-of-18), but the Crimson countered by out-rebounding Penn by 12 boards and elevating its offense in the second frame. Harvard shot 56.7 percent from the field in the final 20 minutes, pulling away to its largest margin of 8 with about four-and-a-half left to play.
Penn’s limited seven-man rotation saw double-digit performances from first-years Jordan Dingle and Max Martz as well as seniors Devon Goodman and AJ Brodeur, but no player in particular found extended success. Dingle knocked down three triples to lead the Quakers’ scoring at halftime, but was subsequently limited to just four points in the second half.
“They shot the ball incredibly well in the first half, and we just kind of mentioned to our guys and we just weren't thinking that they could keep that up with the defensive pressure that we thought we could bring in the second half,” Amaker said.
Much like the first tilt at the Palestra, the Crimson was beleaguered by a sluggish start, converting on just one basket in its first eight field goal attempts. A vibrant Penn crowd led by its traveling band provided an early dose of energy for the Quakers, but Harvard’s offense gradually came to life — both sides saw the lead flip-flop five times in the first 10 minutes of play.
While senior big Chris Lewis could not get anything going against Princeton’s Richmond Aririguzoh on Friday night, the Alpharetta, Ga., native benefited from a less formidable matchup against Penn junior forward Jarrod Simmons, quickly eclipsing his 2-point showing against the Tigers with an and-one finish at the 8-minute mark. Typically manned by Penn’s AJ Brodeur, Quakers coach Steve Donahue elected to match his prized senior on Harvard’s Rob Baker instead.
Lewis would finish the first half with 10 points and largely carried most of the offensive load for the Crimson in the frame.
“I think his mentality, you know, talking with him and just us rallying around him — telling him even though he didn't have a great game on Friday that we're still rocking with him,” Bassey said. “He's still our guy, we are still playing inside out.”
The two sides continued to keep things knotted at 15, 17, and 22 heading into the final four minutes of the frame. But a four-point play from Quakers first-year Jordan Dingle provided to be an important pendulum, propelling Penn to an extended 11-5 run to end the half. Penn shot at an impressive 58 percent rate from the field in that frame — compared to just Harvard’s 33 percent — as it took a 33-27 lead into halftime. The Quakers converted on 7 of its last 9 field goals entering halftime.
Both sides logged buckets at an electrifying pace to begin the second frame. A total of 18 combined points were scored by the first media timeouts as Kirkwood catalyzed the Crimson with two steals and two baskets. Penn reciprocated in due fashion, preserving its 40-38 in the initial five minutes.
But the tide seemed to turn soon after, as Bassey followed up an aggressive drive to the rim with a top-of-the-arc triple to give Harvard its first lead since the six-minute mark of the first half. Kirkwood continued his early half intensity, finishing two more opportunities at the rim.
It took a second push, this time catapulted by a charge on Brodeur from first-year Idan Tretout, for the Harvard lead to be more comfortable. Tretout would blaze by his defender for a lefty layup, followed by a Bassey up-and-under layup off of his own missed three that brought the Lavietes crowd to its feet with a 6-point lead at the 8:18 mark.
“[Idan]'s been playing amazing and practice, and I think that's why a big part of why he's playing so well now,” Kirkwood said. “The coaching staff knows he has been hooping. We really believe in him and I think it goes without saying like when you go into a game without much rhythm and you can still make an impact. It shows his kind of character and it's testament of who he is as a player.”
The Crimson, benefiting off a fourth foul drawn on Goodman, held tight to its six-margin and handed the keys to its regular starters to close the game. Penn cut the lead back to three with one minute left to play, but after a Kirkwood giveaway, Dingle was unable to convert a fast-break three. The Quakers fouled Bassey, and he sank one of two for a 69-65 lead. Penn could not convert in its final possession and the Crimson let out a collective exhale to cap off a 4-0 homestand.
Both Lewis and Kirkwood earned strong praise from Amaker in completing the much-needed weekend sweep.
“I can't say enough about Chris Lewis, especially after a tough night last night, how he bounced back tonight and just had a tremendous game for us. You can see what Kirkwood does for our team we just get a lot of confidence from him, as we did with Bryce in terms of [being] that kind of scoring player. You get confidence from those kinds of guys. So just a tremendous effort by our ballclub and proud of our guys for a great weekend.”
