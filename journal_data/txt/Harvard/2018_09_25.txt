After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes a red pump says it all. Bloody-shoe connoisseur Cardi B demonstrated as much when she hurled one of her glossy crimson slippers at fellow rapper Nicki Minaj during a New York Fashion Week event on Sept. 7. What seemed to be the culmination of one tense night, however, goes far deeper: Feuds don’t develop in vacuums, and dedicated spectators should know this one was many months in the making. The clash is in many ways emblematic of the pressures of being a woman in the rap industry, and tracing its development offers a disheartening picture of how far the business has yet to go.
On paper, the two narratives are so trope-heavy it feels like conflict was inevitable. On one hand, you have an established act losing steam. Nicki Minaj’s 2017 left her facing scrutiny, mediocre releases, and ensuing fatigue. On the other, you had a scrappy upstart whose unapologetic attitude catapulted her into the limelight. Of course, where there is blood in the water (or perhaps just scarlet-glazed Louboutin heels), sharks soon circle. Fans and media alike were quick and insistent on pitting the two musicians against one another, a rivalry which has since snowballed out of control.
To be sure, rap feuds are no new development. Manufactured conflict between two female rappers, however, runs up against discouraging disparities long present in the industry. Analyzing individual labels reveals that they routinely choose not to sign women, barring them from the institutional support necessary to attain commercial success. Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” made her the first solo female rapper to hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in more than two decades and only the fifth of all time, a title her counterpart has yet to receive despite her longer tenure. Statistics like these shed light on why the two stylistically distinct musicians are so often compared: They are the most visible members of a demographic categorically excluded from the charts, easy targets for those who only measure success relatively.
In an industry where people like to pretend there’s only space for one, maybe it’s not such a surprise that these comparisons get personal. As Remy Ma, an outspoken opponent of Nicki Minaj’s, famously said of Nicki Minaj on the Wendy Williams Show, “I have a problem when you’re trying to stop my bag, when you’re trying to stop me from taking care of my children, I have a problem with that.” It’s about more than just clout. It’s about livelihoods.
This is not to say that Nicki Minaj and Cardi B should be absolved of their actions. Both Nicki’s underhanded jibes and alleged comments on Cardi’s parenting and Cardi’s borderline assault are unconscionable. But understanding the ecosystem in which this conflict arose is telling. Perhaps the reason the former has had to play the defensive — launching an album cycle fraught with desperate attempts to top the charts — is because the success of “Queen” was a referendum on her rap position. Perhaps the reason the latter acts so erratically is because of the demands placed on her to leverage her name recognition as a rising star despite being a new mother. Sure, both artists have big personalities that might have caused friction and exacerbated tensions, but the constant goading of a hostile media environment takes at least some of the responsibility.
Tabloids and mainstream media alike love a good catfight. But as its participants lick their wounds and the furor dies down, the fact remains that the factors which fueled this conflict are very much still in play. Maybe the reason Nicki and Cardi were stepping on each other’s trains is because the public wasn’t providing them enough space to stand alone.
Correction: Feb. 20, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Remy Ma spoke out against Wendy Williams. In fact, Ma spoke out against Nicki Minaj on the Wendy Williams Show.

As Teresita Fernández’s temporary art installation “Autumn (...Nothing Personal)” enters its last days in Tercentenary Theatre before it is taken down on Oct. 1, Harvard has some final events planned with the artist. Fernández herself has been involved in many of these events, including a lecture called “Teresita Fernández: Wayfinding” at Harvard Art Museums on Sept. 20.
In a talk planned through a collaboration between the Harvard University Committee on the Arts and the Harvard Art Museums, Fernández shared many of her past works, her inspiration behind the installation, and her thoughts on how the public has utilized the piece. Then President Barack Obama appointed Fernández to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in 2011, and she is known worldwide especially for her work with public sculptures and art pieces dealing with natural phenomena.
Throughout its time in the hotspot of Harvard Yard, the installation has been the space for many events, including dance performances, poetry citations, and readings of the James Baldwin essay that inspired the piece.
Fernández said it’s also been inspiring to see how both small and large organized groups of people have found the installation as a space to gather on campus. Some of these groups that usually don’t have a space on campus, she said, can now come together and create.
“The idea is that if you can think of ‘public’ as really just being made up of many unique individuals functioning together, you can create a sense of public intimacy,” Fernández said. “That has always been the ultimate goal of the piece.”
During the talk, Fernández introduced many of her past works scattered around the world including “Fata Morgana” in Madison Square Park and “Blind Blue Landscape” at the Bennesee Art site in Naoshima, Japan. Using these pieces, she discussed the importance of the landscape of an installation. She urged people to not think of landscape as something passive, but rather as a way to have a larger conversation about place.
She then introduced to the audience the question of “Where Am I?” For decades, this question has driven her thought process before starting any piece, especially site-specific works, with understanding landscapes.
“I ask myself this question culturally, racially, socially, historically, geographically, politically, visually, architecturally, psychologically, demographically, legally, economically, environmentally, etymologically, and conceptually,” Fernández said. “It’s not just the physical coordinates, but it’s more about how does this place exist in our imagination and how we construct a narrative on who we are based on where we are.”
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey joined Fernández later on in the lecture for a conversation and question-and-answer session with audience members on “Autumn (...Nothing Personal).” Kelsey also serves as co-chair of the Harvard University Committee on the Arts, the organization that commissioned Fernández.
“What’s extraordinary about the question ‘Where Am I?’ is that it brings together questions of geography, history, identity, economics, and politics,” Kelsey said. “She is asking this question, but she is also inviting us to all ask that. By doing so, she is locating us at the intersection of a bewildering array of forces.”
Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture at the Graduate School of Design Rosetta Elkin, who attended the Sept. 20 lecture, said she has often had conversations with Fernández about the things that relate to their respective works and have found common ground in the elements concealed in pieces.
“Despite the ambiance and color the installation brings to the Yard, it provides public seating, which is usually not there,” Elkin said. “There is a social context for inhibiting seating, and her piece questions this quietly, but it’s worth considering.”
When choosing the location for the installation, Fernández said she was drawn to Tercentenary Theatre not only because of its iconic role in Harvard tradition. She said she deliberately wanted the landscape to create a physical, visually alluring structure where people would sit, gather, and linger, but also to create a space with less obvious social structure.
This public intimacy exemplifies itself to Fernández as individuals, groups, and organizations both off and on campus engage in activities, especially the readings of Baldwin’s essay.
“You can really see this in palpable ways when the essay is read aloud in the center of the circle,” Fernández said. “It’s a very private act to read, and there’s something very vulnerable and human about listening to someone who may have an entirely different relationship with the text read it aloud in a very exposed, public space.”
Kelsey also particularly enjoys the public intimacy of the different landscape elements working together with the art.
“I love the dialogue between the polycarbonate tubes, the trees surrounding the installation, and the people that go through or stop in it everyday,” Kelsey said. “There is something so beautiful about the invocation of time and seasons.”
Before the installation closes on Oct. 1, there are several more events, including a Baldwin Reading on Sept. 29.
“With the time left of the installation, there is something bittersweet and a little somber, but that ephemeral quality deliberately relates to autumn and to the title of the piece,” Fernández said. “It prompts an introspective mood that also relates to the social aspects of the project. As the weeks progress, it feels like the piece is really being embraced in the way that I intended — but it has also been used in ways that I could have never imagined.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, “Don’t Leave Me Alone” seems like any other pop tune about a girl yearning for her lover. We have Anne-Marie, an ice-blonde starlet, reminiscing about a reticent man as she drifts through her morning routine. Their moments together are sweet and short: kissing and letting loose on the dance floor, caressing and reaching for leaves, paddling under a bridge. As expected from David Guetta, the music is catchy, captivating, yet simple, and the visuals are nothing short of stunning, especially given their subtleties. As Anne-Marie laments, “Don’t you ever leave me, don’t leave me alone,” the screen gently crackles with silver static interspersed between short sequences where Anne-Marie stares longingly at the camera.
Yet there’s an unmistakably eerie feel to the setting: Anne-Marie’s eyes glow with an artificial cyan hue, her bedroom is situated in an apocalyptic steel box, and — perhaps most creepily of all — all of her memories of her boyfriend are, in fact, digitized experiences played through her virtual reality glasses. Throughout the video, small details that would otherwise go unnoticed heighten the mystery of the futuristic environment and transform the meaning of the lyrics. For example, hanging over Anne-Marie’s bed is a black and white poster of man with crimson graffiti scrawled across his face, spelling out the words, “NO GODS NO MASTERS.” Does it refer to anarchy, nihilism, or perhaps even feminism?
As Anne-Marie pours cereal into a bowl, we’re able to discern the words “i am cereal” on the plain white cereal box. The brandless cereal box seems to be a mockery of rampant product placement in music videos. It proclaims instead to be simply what it is: just plain cereal. Beyond the bedroom windows is a “Metropolis”-esque city filled with skinny skyscrapers, a throwback to the ’20s. In fact, the entire atmosphere of the bedroom evokes a certain nostalgia for a time before advanced technology became commonplace. The room is filtered in soft sepia tones reminiscent of 19th Century photography, a stark contrast to later scenes cast in bright blue light emitted from fluorescent bulbs.
“A-, a-, -lone,” Anne-Marie softly wails as she sits alone, wallowing in misery. Her croon soon breaks into a hypnotizing beat as she slips on a pair of virtual reality glasses to cure her loneliness. And indeed, her escape from reality does help her cope with her emotions, at least for a few minutes. The glasses immediately take her to a dance club where neon pink and blue strobe lights bounce across writhing bodies. Emerging from the crowd, her lover gazes upon her as he languidly approaches her. We get a glimpse of his unnaturally light irises, prompting us to wonder whether he’s a real human being or just a simulation.
Firmly secured on Anne-Marie’s spandex jumpsuit is a neon green yin-yang symbol, which seems in line with the theme of her lyrics: She’s unable to exist without her counterpart. But as her virtual trip nears its end and the two land in a barren tundra, reality hits and her lover fizzles out, leaving her cold and alone. We’re taken back to her bedroom as she lowers her glasses, leaving us to wonder who or what she really can’t live without. Is it simply her boyfriend, or is it technology itself?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David Crosby has played many influential musical and cultural roles over the course of his long career. He is a founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash, a pioneer of folk rock, psychedelic rock, and soft rock, and an enduring symbol of the 1960s hippie spirit. Crosby has continued to explore new terrain on his most recent releases, including his newest album, 2017’s eclectic “Sky Trails.” Before his event on Tuesday, Sept. 25 at Sanders Theater, the Crimson spoke with Crosby about his decades-long career of musical creativity.
The Harvard Crimson: Your latest album, “Sky Trails,” is stylistically all over the place. There’s old-fashioned folk-rock on some songs, but there’s jazz, neo soul, and lots of other stuff going on. Do you think about stylistic consistency or diversity when you write and record?
David Crosby: No, we don’t think about it at all. The songs are really the key to the whole deal. The quality level of the songs defines the whole experience, so that’s really the key deal. When we go writing for a record, we’re trying to write songs that will mean something to you, that’ll move you. We don’t really try to do this kind [of song], and that kind, and the other kind, and spread them around, or have a plan. It’s not like that at all. The songs just grow organically of themselves, and they tell us what to do.
THC: So you don’t think, “I want to write a jazz album,” or “I want to write a folk album,” or “I want to write an album that has lots of different styles in it?”
DC: I think, “I want to write an album that has a lot of good songs on it.”
THC: One thing I’ve observed that’s constant in your work, from the Byrds to newer songs like “Before Tomorrow Falls on Love,” is unorthodox and unusual sequences of chords. Joni Mitchell calls them “chords of inquiry.”
DC: Well, you know, she can call them anything she wants. Basically, I got turned on to pretty dense chord structures by jazz keyboard players: Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, people like that. They would play these big tone-cluster chords that just thrilled me, and I couldn’t play them on the guitar in regular tuning. What I found was that, in other tunings, I could play them, so that’s how I started being a tunings guy. Then Joni Mitchell became my old lady for a year, and that was an education in tunings, and then I ran into Michael Hedges, who was probably the king of guitar tunings. They gave me a way to do more complex chords, more intricate stuff, which fascinates me. I love it.
THC: Another thing I see throughout your career is that you love working with collaborators. You’ve worked with Graham Nash a lot, you work with your son, James Raymond, you do stuff with Michael League, to name a few. Why are you so drawn to musical partnerships?
DC: Because the other guy always thinks of something you didn’t. Think about it this way: Imagine yourself and another person making a painting. And you have seven colors on your pallet, and they have seven different colors on their pallet. You combine the pallets, it’s a better painting.
THC: Is there song you can point to and say, “Here’s a part where my collaborator made it better?”
DC: I’ll tell you the most recent example that really thrills me. Have you heard the [2018 single] “Glory?” Well, when we walked into the studio, we did not have that song. I had part of the guitar changes, but the four of us [Crosby, Becca Stevens, Michelle Willis, and Michael League] wrote that song together. I’d never written with four people together, and that’s an amazing thing, that we could write together, and that we could get that quality level to happen. That’s a really, really good song, and we walked in and wrote it together, the four of us. And that’s a thrill to me, a very exciting thing.
THC: One thing that I really admire in your work is your harmony singing, especially with the Byrds. On songs like “Here Without You,” “Have You Seen Her Face,” and “5D,” your harmonizing is so free and unpredictable. I have theories about where you’re coming from — there’s a tradition of high-part harmony singing in rock music that runs through Phil Everly and Paul McCartney, and some country singers who came before them — but you’re much freer than those guys. Where did your harmony-writing sensibility come from?
DC: Ah, I don’t know. A lot of it comes from listening to classical music, a lot of it comes from listening to folk music, and a lot of it comes from listening to jazz. I just naturally go there. It’s my natural thing to do, to sing harmonies. In the Byrds, it was mostly two-part [harmony arrangements], which gives you more room to mess around. Crosby, Stills & Nash harmonies were mostly three-part, much harder to do interesting stuff there, because there’s not as much room to maneuver. In the Byrds, it was only two parts, most of it, so I could maneuver a lot, create tension and release, and it was pretty fascinating.
THC: Another thing I hear that’s unique in your music, starting with the Byrds and continuing through a lot of your solo stuff, is a sense of spaciousness and relaxation that I don’t hear in other pop/rock music that came before you. For example, the Byrds song “Bells of Rhymney” sounds similar to the Beatles’ “If I Needed Someone,” but “Bells of Rhymney” feels much more unhurried and spacious.
DC: It does have a really good feel to it. I think “Bells of Rhymney” is one of my favorite ones, and I think the feel comes largely from Roger [McGuinn, Byrds co-founder and lead guitarist]. Roger is a really brilliant musician, and he just inherently can do things that other people find difficult. He played a certain feel on there, and I think that’s where that one came from. He did a great job.
THC: McGuinn has said, and others have written, that he was the leader of the Byrds. Is that true? And what did his leadership look like in practice?
DC: It’s absolutely true. There’s no question about it. Being the best musician of us, he knew a lot more about how to play than we did, and he was very, very good at arranging, for instance, Bob Dylan songs into pop music. He had a beautiful talent for it. And when other band members brought in original songs, he would come with arrangement ideas, and they would be good. He’s a really good musician.
THC: Well, you heard it here first.

Late capitalism, crony capitalism, disaster capitalism, philanthro-capitalism, racial capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, cultural capitalism. Forget what you know about capitalism — it’s defined as something much broader than our country’s free-market principles at “Museum of Capitalism,” a roving exhibition currently on view at Tufts’ School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA). The project, conceived by art team FICTILIS, pushes the boundaries of the museum’s traditional role. “Museum of Capitalism” does an impressive job of historicizing capitalism to investigate its impact on America’s economic, political, and artistic fabric.
To be clear, “Museum of Capitalism” is a tongue-in-cheek exercise. The show feels as if it’s poking fun at the slightly absurd notion of making a museum about our country’s controversial one-percent-friendly economic principles. There is no definitive pro-capitalist or anti-capitalist stance, but rather a deep inquiry into the (often surprising) effects of American capitalism. The cerebral nature of “Museum of Capitalism” does mean that museumgoers mainly interested in aesthetic stimulation may need to look elsewhere. Most pieces in the show require heavy contextualization.
That said, the exhibition literature is extremely well done. Gallery texts are thorough enough to make the show approachable for the layman of both art and capitalism, and perfect for a university-affiliated space. A standout piece is Tim Portlock’s “CASH_4_GOLD” series of four archival pigment prints reimagining scenes of forclosed houses in San Bernardino, California, as romantic landscapes. The tension between Portlock’s whimsical flourishes and the eery scenes of empty suburbia is both visually interesting and a poignant take on the uncomfortable-to-look-at paradoxes of capitalism. A large portion of the show’s works are found object sculptures, like a 1960s Barbie Dream House or Jennifer Dalton’s “Your Name Here,” a lucite briefcase stuffed with $1,351,220 in credit card offers collected from one person’s mail over a year. One wall of the show is lined with quotes from Martin Luther King, Jr. who wrote critically about American capitalism. Another wall has a video installation of car accident victims reenacting their crashes at abandoned Pontiac dealerships. For those more interested in the strictly financial facets of capitalism, there’s a “Minimum Wage Machine” that you can crank to pump out pennies, a wall of investment guide books burned with the logos of banks closed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and a collection of letters celebrating the end of an employee’s long career at IBM.
There’s something for everyone at “Museum of Capitalism,” which is unsurprising considering the “era of capitalism” is still one we’re still living in. Those on the winning and losing sides of capitalist economic policies are equally represented at the exhibition. It’s unexpected and quite innovative to attempt to capture an ongoing, amorphous phenomenon like capitalism in a museum, and “Museum of Capitalism” does a remarkable job.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve realized recently that I have very basic taste in music. My Spotify is indistinguishable from that of a 10th grade skater boy who was the first of his friends to discover Rex Orange County and BROCKHAMPTON. There’s nothing wrong with being basic, I guess, but every now and again I find myself engaged in a weird pissing contest with a dude (yes, inevitably a dude) who wants to prove that he can rattle off more obscure alt bands than I can, and I don’t like losing anything, not even weird pissing contests. It’s also a bummer to find some of my favorite songs on the playlists of people I’m not particularly fond of, which is obviously a petty and ridiculous problem to have, but it just stinks that I can’t listen to HONNE anymore.
Anyway, this is all to say that I’ve compiled a list of five songs (not really a playlist, though I guess you could play them all together if you so desired) that really slap and are definitely, definitely lesser known and therefore cooler than anything favored by your average Pitchfork fanboy.
1. “Der Mondfleck” by Arnold Schoenberg
In high school, I used to start my mornings with a rousing a cappella rendition of this song. Der Mondfleck, or Moonfleck, is the 18th song in Arnold Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire cycle. Adapted from a book of fin-de-siècle Symbolist poetry, the Pierrot Lunaire song cycle explores themes of moral and sexual degeneracy and physical and mental illness. Der Mondfleck in particular is a portrait of neurosis: It depicts a clown, the titular Pierrot, mistaking the moonlight on his coat for a piece of plaster and frantically wiping at the fleck of moon until morning. Because Schoenberg was the father of atonality, the Pierrot Lunaire cycle is not sung in any key at all. In fact, it should be sung in the Sprechstimme style, which means that no specific pitch is ever intended; it is only relative pitches that matter. All in all, this makes for a very sexy set of songs. Der Mondfleck is on both my study playlist and my pregame playlist.
2. “El Grillo” by Josquin des Prez
El Grillo is a fun little frottola by Josquin, one of the big daddies of Renaissance polyphony. The song tells the story of a cricket who is a good singer, which is a pretty cute concept. We don’t get many insect-themed songs nowadays, and I think that’s something that should change. El Grillo is a great addition to any workout or party playlist.
3. “O Jerusalem” by Hildegard von Bingen
Before Queen Bey came Queen von B! Hildegard was born in 1098 and never stopped slaying, except in 1179, which is when she died. That seems like a very long lifespan for a medieval woman, but I guess it helped that she was a nun and never had to give birth to a flea-bitten brood of 12. O Jerusalem is a pretty nice song. I think it deserves a place in every playlist.
4. “It’s Gonna Rain” by Steve Reich
53 years ago, Steve Reich became the grandfather of SoundCloud rapper sampling when he remixed a recording of a Pentecostal preacher talking about the end of the world. This is a good song to wake up to.
5. “Tropical Fish Opera” by Ramon Sender
I can’t find this on Spotify but you can put this together yourself in a pinch. Fill a big heated fish tank with fish and acquire an orchestra. Draw staff lines on the tank. Assign each musician a fish. Each musician must play the note indicated by the location of his or her fish. The closer a fish swims to its musician, the louder the note should be played and vice versa.
This can go on as long as you want.

Roger McGuinn is best known as the singer and lead guitarist of the Byrds, a California-based band considered among the most influential acts of the 1960s. The Byrds’ debut album, “Mr. Tambourine Man” (1965), was a seminal work of folk rock music, and their sixth album, “Sweetheart of the Rodeo” (1968), was a major milestone in the development of country-rock. The Byrds underwent many lineup changes, and McGuinn, who wrote songs in addition to singing and playing, was the only member who stayed in the band for its entire run.
This fall, McGuinn, Byrds bassist and co-founder Chris Hillman, and country singer-songwriter Marty Stuart are touring to celebrate “Sweetheart of the Rodeo”’s 50th anniversary, and they will perform in Boston at the Colonial Theatre on Wednesday, Sept. 26. The Harvard Crimson spoke with McGuinn about the Byrds’ career, the making of “Sweetheart of the Rodeo,” and his current tour.
The Harvard Crimson: From what I’ve read about the Beatles and [Beatles producer] George Martin, it seems like Martin was effectively their musical director early in their career. Then, as they became more famous, they were more empowered to take the reins themselves. Is that how it went with you guys and [producer of the Byrds’ first two albums] Terry Melcher?
Roger McGuinn: No, I wouldn’t elevate Terry Melcher to the level of George Martin. Terry was a good producer, but he wasn’t the musician that George Martin was, and he didn’t really tell us our parts. We figured out the parts ourselves. We’d sit around with a guitar and take the elements of a chord: “You sing this part, and I’ll sing that part,” and so on.
THC: Would you say similar things about Allen Stanton [producer of the Byrds’ third album] and Gary Usher [producer of their fourth, fifth, and sixth albums]?
RM: Gary was more of a hands-on producer. Allen Stanton was kind of like, “Turn on the machine and let’s see what happens.”
THC: What hands-on things would Gary do?
RM: Gary was really good. He invented a way to take two eight-tracks [tape recording machines that allowed for eight distinct layers of recorded sound] and spool them together and make a 16-track out of it before they’d invented a standalone 16-track recorder. He was into experimental things like sound effects, backwards tape, and so on, things that the Beatles had been experimenting with. We all listened to the Beatles and were inspired by them, and Gary was into that. He was very cool about using different effects.
THC: I’ve always listened to “The Notorious Byrd Brothers” [one of the three Gary Usher-produced Byrds albums] and thought, “How did they get those crazy sounds with primitive equipment?” but it turns out the equipment wasn’t actually primitive.
RM: Some of it wasn’t, but some of it was. Some of the things were just, like, banging on the strings of a piano with the sustain pedal down, so it’d go “bonnnng.” The sounds at the beginning of “Dolphin’s Smile” [a track on “The Notorious Byrd Brothers”] were done by clicking the strings on the underside of the bridge on the guitar.
THC: By 1968, when the “Notorious” album came out, the Byrds’ music had moved steadily from folk-rock to psychedelic rock. I know you’d experimented with other genres, but basically, you’d moved toward psychedelic music. So the country sound of “Sweetheart” was a big departure. Why did you want to change what you were doing?
RM: I think we all got burned out on psychedelia. It became too much — too much sound, too much noise — and we wanted to get back to something simple. And then Gram Parsons [country-rock singer-songwriter who played with the Byrds for a short period in 1968] came along, and he was a catalyst to doing it.
THC: Why do you think Gram ultimately left the Byrds?
RM: I think he enticed was by [Rolling Stones guitarist] Keith Richards. He and Keith really became good friends. I think Gram probably thought he could be one of the Rolling Stones by doing that [leaving the Byrds and spending time with Richards].
THC: He thought he was going to join the Stones?
RM: I mean, he stepped up from the International Submarine Band [Parsons’ previous project] to the Byrds. And then: from the Byrds to the Stones.
THC: How do you feel about that?
RM: I think it’s amusing. But, you know, I always liked Gram. He was a charismatic individual. He had a lot of enthusiasm, and that’s why we all fell in love with country and recorded “Sweetheart of the Rodeo.” We were friends even after he left and was in the Flying Burrito Brothers with Chris [Hillman]. He’d come over to my house and play pool, and we’d ride motorcycles together, so I didn’t hold anything against him. We got along great.
THC: A lot of critics and music historians credit “Sweetheart of the Rodeo” with inventing the country-rock genre. When you were recording it, did you feel like you were doing something novel?
RM: No, we didn’t. We didn’t think of what the perception would be at all. We just wanted to make an album of country music, and I think the fact that we had been playing rock and roll bled over into it. It wasn’t really an intentional combination of country and rock. And as far as inventing a genre goes, Gram had done an album with the International Submarine Band [“Safe at Home”], and that predated “Sweetheart of the Rodeo” if you want to find the first country-rock album. But I guess we were the first well-known rock band to record a country album.
THC: What if we go even more granular: Who was the first well-known rock band to record a country-rock song? I think that might also be the Byrds, with “Mr. Spaceman,” right?
RM: I have to say, I got the idea for “Mr. Spaceman” from Ringo’s Buck Owens song, “Act Naturally.” The Beatles did it before the Byrds. They had “I’ve Just Seen a Face,” too.
THC: “Sweetheart” didn’t sell very well when it came out, did it?
RM: It bombed. People didn’t get it. The country people didn’t get it, and the rock people didn’t get it, and then about 40 years later, everybody got it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jay Gonzalez gave a speech in Harvard Square endorsing what was once a fringe concept — a tax on the endowments of institutions of higher learning — that is now becoming more mainstream. Gonzalez proposed a 1.6 percent tax on private, non-profit colleges and universities in the state with endowments over $1 billion, which would cost Harvard over $500 million — well over the projected $43 million that would have gone to the federal government in 2017 if the federal government had taxed the endowment. This is because Gonzalez’s plan — unlike the one passed by Congress — taxes all endowment assets instead of just the income garnered from them.
In light of this new proposal, our opinion on the matter remains unchanged. We did not support the tax when Republicans pushed for it at the federal level, and we do not support it now that some Democrats have pushed for it at the state level. The proposal is dangerous and reckless. Indeed, the quick acceptance of endowment taxes in mainstream politics signals a radical, unprecedented attack on higher education, and a worrying reflection of how higher education is perceived in our country.
Ironically, the revenues from the tax are proposed to go towards funding public education. Thus, this proposal creates a tradeoff between one form of education for another — robbing colleges to fund public schools.
The state of Massachusetts has always placed a high premium on education, which is reflected in the stellar status of its public school systems compared to the rest of the nation and its world-class colleges and universities, including Harvard. While Harvard may weather this financial storm because of its hefty endowment, what if this plan cripples a school with a much smaller endowment, like Wellesley?
Additionally, Harvard would not only have to grapple with making massive cuts to already-strained budgets across its schools, but also with the complex logistics surrounding such a tax. Even now, nearly a year after the Republican endowment tax proposal became law, the University still does not know how to file its returns, having received no guidance from the federal government. This dilemma would only become more complicated with a concurrent state-level tax, especially one as massive as the one Gonzalez calls for.  The University would waste valuable resources attempting to solve labyrinthine tax problems.
We do sympathize with Gonzalez’s interest in helping public education, though we certainly do not believe the tax is the right way to accomplish it. Whether or not the tax does become law, we believe Harvard should still contribute to Boston-area communities, and particularly to its schools.
This tax represents misguided thinking and a contempt for higher education that is en vogue among politicians. At a time when the work the University does is more important and groundbreaking than ever — making new discoveries, advancing branches of knowledge, and using its tools to help the public — this tax is calculated to destroy Harvard financially and leave it unable to do more. However, perhaps the greatest consequence the proposed endowment tax has on society is its casual dismissal of the important work universities do to change the world for the better.

We believe that intent matters. Just because Harvard students have been provided with a lucrative education doesn’t mean that we are entitled to it. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jay Gonzalez has outlined a tax on large private university endowments that would serve to fund public education at the K-12 and public higher education levels, as well as public transportation. If Harvard were truly committed to educational equity, it would be supportive of redistributive policies that would increase access to quality education for all students — not just those privileged enough to attend this institution.
We recognize that endowment taxes could be viewed as an attack on institutions of higher learning, especially considering that just earlier this year the taxes were used by Republicans to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. However, we believe that an endowment tax levied by the state could be the first step towards ensuring educational success for Massachusetts residents at large. As an institution that boasts one of the largest endowments in the world, Harvard must begin to analyze the role it has played in exacerbating inequality in the greater Cambridge area and be critical about the ways in which it has financially benefited from their tax exemptions as a “non-profit.”
Indeed, Harvard takes in a tremendous amount of money each year. With the cost of undergraduate tuition costing approximately $67,580, Harvard must receive millions every year in fees from its undergraduate and graduate students. Though Harvard’s generous financial aid program does much to alleviate this tuition burden from its most disadvantaged students — 55 percent of undergraduates receive need-based scholarships — this does not change the fact that the remaining 45 percent of the class pays tuition in full.
To add to that sum, Harvard receives billions of dollars in donations from wealthy alumni. In 2014, the Harvard School of Public Health received a donation of $350 million, and was renamed the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The list goes on: John A. Paulson donated $400 million to the School of Engineering in 2015; India’s Tata Group — which is closely affiliated with Harvard Business School alumnus Ratan N. Tata — donated $50 million to the Business School in 2010. This tremendous volume of money will certainly survive being taxed, allowing more than enough to remain to fund financial aid and research initiatives. Thus, for the sake of keeping the wealth of institutions of higher education in check, Harvard’s endowment should be taxed.
Harvard has avoided paying certain taxes for years because of its label as a non-profit, but it’s undeniable that its presence in Cambridge has had negative effects on surrounding communities. Harvard has been guilty of gentrification. This includes not only the over 600 acres of land that the University owns, but also the amount of property that has been bought out or rented by wealthy Harvard affiliates who reside in the surrounding communities. As a result, Harvard’s expansion has diminished the amount of low-income people of color who live in the area.
Additionally, Harvard has been afforded mass tax exemptions that have negatively affected local economies. While the University participates in a “payment in lieu of taxes” program, there are few structures set in place to ensure accountability or that payments reflect the full extent of Harvard’s financial gain. In the past, Cambridge city officials have been critical about the University’s failure to meet PILOT requests and the impact that not paying property taxes has had on the city.
Harvard recently surpassed the fundraising goal set in its capital campaign by over $3 billion. An endowment tax would only cost the University a sixth of this, barely making a dent in Harvard’s budget. It would seem to have little effect on Harvard, but could mean great improvements for the larger community. We believe the tax on Harvard’s endowment could be put to use by giving money back to the community that Harvard has been taking from for centuries. Keeping all these considerations in mind, we agree with Gonzalez’s point that it’s time for Harvard to start paying its fair share. This is not something Harvard would be doing as a charitable act — the institution has the moral obligation to comply with an endowment tax after taking so much for its own self-interests that have been disguised as noble in the name of education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I literally laughed out loud when I saw the email. A member of the Classics Department faculty notified the concentration listserv that the Smyth Classics Library would be closed temporarily this summer for a few renovations, which included a new coat of paint, new chairs, and the removal of all but one of the portraits in the name of creating a more “inclusive space.”
It is quite amusing to me that the Classics Department would be concerned about the inclusivity of its library — one of the few libraries on campus that requires special swipe access and therefore is an “exclusive” space that only students affiliated with the Classics Department can regularly access.
Now, I truly love the classics at Harvard. The faculty are world-class scholars and educators and I’ve met some of my best friends and classmates in my Latin courses. I strongly believe that Latin, Greek, and ancient history are not “dead” or useless things, as many 21st century technocrats might believe, but rather, they are immortal things. The classics speak first and foremost to a human condition and spirit not much altered over the last two millennia, and humanity’s continued fascination and exploration of lives lived so long ago reflect something transcendent and timeless about the ideas and stories those lives produced.
The removal of portraits depicting prior Harvard Classics scholars, then, presumably because they were too white and too old (I certainly don’t know that for sure, but what else could it be in academia these days?) seems somewhat incongruous for a discipline that usually grapples with more profound questions of human identity with great rigor. (I’ll continue to overlook the fact that you must swipe into the library in the first place too for now.)
This somewhat baffling move is merely indicative of a concerning trend across college campuses. For all our efforts to improve “inclusivity” and “belonging” and similar niceties, we are often unwilling to consider their natural and necessary opposites, such as exclusion and non-belonging. If we are to seek inclusion, it is simply a logical necessity that some will be excluded, such as those without swipe into the Classics library. (Sorry, I thought I could let it go but I couldn’t help myself.) If we are to seek belonging, it is again a logical necessity that some will not belong, perhaps because they do not share our interests or values. (Some people choose to study math or computer science instead.)
We do scholars and students (indeed our very humanity) a great disservice when we assume and reinforce the notion that inclusion and belonging are primarily questions of sharing surface-level similarities. I may be a young, stubborn Asian-American female, but I would imagine I might have more in common with the mind of an old, dead, white male who also loves Latin than perhaps that of someone who looks like me in the Women, Gender Studies, and Sexuality Department.
I’m a little skeptical of the notion championed by many progressive-types that “you can’t be what you can’t see,” because when taken to its logical end, it would appear that our primary criterion for association are literally the physical traits like race, age, and sex we observe in others. I know humans have a powerful impulse for association with humans who look similar, but surely, in the pursuit of scholarship, belonging and inclusion ought to value substance over senses. When inclusion is a substantive matter instead of a trivial question of portraiture, though, it might be the case that fewer people will be included, but that inclusion is far more meaningful and profound.
The study of the classics to me is ultimately testament to the idea that there are things far more integral to the human condition than trivialities of label and association. Like hundreds of years’ worth of scholars who came before us, we have decided that there are some lives, some ideas, and some stories that transcend their geographic, racial, gender, diversity-label-whatnot boundaries and are worth our time and diligent study.
I bet those old dead white men on the library walls were just as fascinated by the tour-de-force of the Homerian epics as I am. I bet they chuckled as uncomfortably as I did reading Catullus 16. I bet they thought of their own unrequited loves as they read Aeneid IV. I might not see my own ambiguously ethnic facial features in them, nor my sex, nor my age, but I do see part of my mind and passions. Those men and I belong to a cohort whose standards of inclusion point to something indeed far greater.

Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences announced the appointment of Danielle E. Farrell as Assistant Director of Student Affairs earlier this month.
In her new role, Farrell will serve as a Title IX coordinator for the roughly 4,000 Ph.D. and masters students enrolled in GSAS. Seth Avakian, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ officer for Title IX and professional conduct, also works with graduate students to provide information about, and enforce, the University’s Title IX procedures.
Harvard’s 12 schools employ more than 50 coordinators to oversee the University’s compliance with Title IX, a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment.
Farrell previously worked as a Title IX coordinator at the Harvard Division of Continuing Education. She held a similar role at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. At GSAS, she will fill the position previously held by Caysie A. Carter, who moved to the University's central Title IX office this year.
In the GSAS statement announcing Farrell’s appointment, Avakian said he “look[s] forward to learning from her previous experience at DCE.”
Farrell and Avakian will spend the fall organizing focus groups to evaluate the Title IX training offered to students and staff within GSAS. The online module forms part of a University-wide effort to implement recommendations from a 2016 task force on sexual assault prevention, which called for trainings for students, faculty, and staff. Earlier this year, Harvard College required undergraduates to complete its own version of online Title IX training before they were able to enroll in courses.
Farrell wrote in an email she is excited about working with Avakian.
“I am partnering with Seth Avakian on our online and in-person trainings, with an aim of reaching more departments this year,” she wrote. “I am looking forward to serving as a supportive resource for students to ensure that they understand their options and are able to do their best work at Harvard. Overall, I want to set them up for success as students and after they graduate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At almost exactly 12:57 p.m. Monday, several hundred Harvard undergraduates and Law School students rose from their desks, packed up their bags, and walked out of their classrooms.
They strode across campus to a small plaza sparsely dotted with trees, shouting calls for “Justice!” into the crisp afternoon air. A handful clambered atop a granite rock reading “Harvard Law School” and lofted bullhorns. Almost all wore black. Many pinned small pink buttons declaring “I Believe Christine Blasey Ford” to their chests.
“America is at a crossroads,” third-year Law School student and president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association Lauren D. Williams told the crowd. “It can turn a wilfully ignorant blind eye, as it has done countless times before, or it can stand by these survivors and ensure that there is a fair investigation and a fair judiciary hearing.”
Williams was referring to the accusations of sexual misconduct that have roiled the once seemingly surefire Supreme Court confirmation of President Donald Trump nominee and conservative judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. Over the course of the past week, at least two women have come forward with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted them decades ago.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Ford — a widely published psychology professor from California — said that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, ground his body against hers, and sought to remove her clothes at a party both attended while in high school. And in a later interview with the New Yorker, a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, alleged that Kavanaugh had pushed his penis in her face at a party when both were enrolled as undergraduates at Yale.
Both Ford and Kavanaugh are set to testify about his alleged misbehavior at a high-stakes, nationally televised hearing Thursday. Kavanaugh has repeatedly and unequivocally denied the women’s allegations — and did so again in an interview with Fox News on Monday.
But his declarations of innocence have not convinced some at Harvard Law School. Monday’s walkout and rally — which lasted for roughly 20 minutes in total — follows a Harvard Law Record article published last week in which four students called on the University to bar Kavanaugh from teaching at the Law School pending a “full and fair investigation” into the allegations of sexual misbehavior.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a lecturer at the Law School, where he has taught since 2008. He is scheduled to teach a course titled “The Supreme Court Since 2005” during the 2019 winter term, a special three-week session that takes place each January.
Second-year Law School student Sejal Singh, who helped organize the walkout on behalf of anti-harassment student advocacy group the Pipeline Parity Project, said in an interview after the event that Kavanaugh’s confirmation would have a far-reaching impact on American teenagers.
“We should think about not just the message that his presence on the Supreme Court would send to the American people, not just to women, but to boys, who see that there’s no consequences for this kind of behavior,” she said.
Though the crowd was mostly composed of Law School students, the walkout also drew participants from the College — and a few passersby. Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she tried to get the word out to Harvard undergraduates over the weekend and on Monday. The group posted about the event on social media and sent details over Harvard email lists.
Alexandra “Vail” Kohnert-Yount, a second-year Law student who helped plan the walkout, said the demonstration was meant as more than simple protest.
“This walkout symbolizes the lack of an investigation into these allegations, it symbolizes the Harvard administration’s deafening silence on this matter, and it expresses our deep concern as human beings and as Americans for the harms that Judge Kavanaugh would do to us,” she said.
Shortly after Kavanaugh’s nomination in July, Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 praised and congratulated the judge in a statement posted on a Harvard website. Manning called Kavanaugh “an inspiring teacher and mentor” who has demonstrated “generosity, dedication, and collegiality” during his time teaching in Cambridge.
Manning has not commented publicly on Kavanaugh since the first allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced over a week ago.
“It is Law School policy not to comment on personnel matters," Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in a statement.
Asked about the walkout, Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells wrote in a statement Monday night that the school recognizes its students are working to process the recent spate of news reports surrounding Kavanaugh.
“We are supporting our students as they grapple with these issues in different ways,” Sells said. “On Thursday, when the hearings are aired, we will provide a space for students to watch together as a community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Youth activists from across the country — including David Hogg, co-founder of March for Our Lives, and Jessica Browning, College Republican National Committee national co-chair  — gathered at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Monday evening to discuss youth voter engagement.
Hogg and Browning were joined by Bria Smith, a youth council representative from Milwaukee, Wis.; Jonathan Rangel, a California youth activist; and Theodore N. Landis ’20, co-founder of the Harvard Votes Challenge. New York Times journalist Farah N. Stockman ’96, who has written about voter engagement on college campuses across the county, moderated the panel.
An Institute of Politics poll, released in April 2018, found that more than 37 percent of young Americans said they “definitely will be voting” in the 2018 elections — an increase of 17 percentage points from those surveyed in 2010, the last time a “wave” election occurred.
“What everyone has described here is a political moment where youth activism is on the rise, and where youth voices are really making an impact,” said Landis, who led the IOP program which develops and administers the poll.
The panelists discussed the importance of civic education in informing these younger voters about the issues facing their communities and the policies of candidates running for office.
Rangel, a high school junior who works with youth organizing program 99 Rootz in California’s Central Valley, said it is especially crucial for students in rural areas to not be complacent with local issues, and to embrace their ability to make change.
“A lot of the youth don’t really get an education even in school about different political views and standpoints,” Rangel said. “In a way, I sort of take on the task — along with a lot of my friends and different leaders in our community — to try to inform the youth about the issues.”
The panelists agreed that emphasizing local issues could help mobilize young voters.
“In my community, we have toxic 1,2,3 TCP in our water,” Rangel added. “Youth, our peers, just thought, 'Oh, nasty water,’ but that’s not the case. We try to let them know the different issues going on in our community.”
Stockman pointed out that in local politics especially, voter efficacy is readily apparent.
“People can win an election with like a few hundred votes,” Stockman said.  “I don’t think a lot of people understand how important it is. People get all into voting for president but when it comes to your local issues, that’s actually where you can make the biggest difference.”
Smith said in her community of Milwaukee, Wis., many youth voters are convinced that “our votes don’t matter because the people sitting in those seats do not represent us.”
“That’s a culture that youth are trying to reform now,” she said. “There are people running for office who’ve never even set foot in my community, because they know that people there will not vote for them, so what’s the point of wasting their time and breath?”
Smith and Hogg both said there is a dearth of politicians who represent youth voters.
“At the end of the day, the only way that we’re going to make older politicians care about us is by voting,” Hogg said.
Landis also introduced the Harvard Votes Challenge — an initiative to register students across the University to vote — and said his group’s mission goes beyond the midterm elections.
“We really need to ingrain voting into Harvard’s culture,” Landis said. “Everyone here knows there are three things you have to do to graduate from Harvard. You know, the John Harvard statue, the Widener thing, but there’s going to be a fourth by the time we’re done. The fourth thing is going to be voting.”

More than 80 Harvard Medical School students and affiliates gathered on the steps of HMS’s Gordon Hall Monday to call for federal funding to study nationwide gun violence as a public health issue.
The participants, who held signs reading “Gun Reform is Healthcare Reform,” were there in support of a “Day of Action” organized by “Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic,” a national organization of healthcare professionals which advocates for “evidence-based policy” to reduce gun injuries.
HMS Dean of Medical Education Edward M. Hundert and Dean for Students Fidencio Saldaña also participated the event, which was organized and largely attended by students.
Organizers and demonstrators cited a lack of government support for research on firearms as one of the greatest barriers to productive reform.
“As scientists, we're systemically prevented from studying the psychological and physiological phenomena involved in gun related violence,” said organizer Maahika Srinivasan, a first year student at HMS.
Srinivasan was referring to the 1996 Dickey Amendment, which the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and lawmakers have interpreted to forbid the agency from funding any research that might support gun control advocacy.
“The result is that 22 years later, more than 600,000 gunshot victims later, much of the federal government has largely abandoned efforts to learn why people shoot one another for themselves and what can be done to prevent it,” Srinivasan added.
The most recent omnibus federal spending bill, passed in March 2018, clarified that the Dickey Amendment does not prohibit the CDC from offering funding to groups doing research on the “causes of gun violence,” but protesters said the agency has not yet allocated any new grants for gun violence research since the update.
Attendees also said they wanted HMS to focus more of its curriculum on guns and gun wounds.
“We care about increasing the presence of firearm research ... in our curriculum at HMS. It's starting to change, but to the extent that it affects our patient population, we really do want that reflected in our curriculum,” said first-year student Fatima O. Mubarak.
Monday’s demonstration was the students’ first on-campus event in coordination with SAFE, but organizers said they are already planning more. They plan to hold an informational lunch on Thursday to discuss the effects of bullet wounds.
First-year organizer Raj Vatsa ’18 said he also hopes to reach out to advocates at other medical schools in the Boston area to plan future events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students interested in joining a fraternity or sorority — while avoiding administrative censure — have at least two options left.
They could sign up for Alpha Phi Alpha, a Greek organization targeted to African-American men; or Alpha Kappa Alpha, a sorority targeted to African-American women.
Both are “cultural interest” fraternities and sororities — groups designed to bring together students with shared heritage and backgrounds. Alpha Phi Alpha accepts members from Harvard, MIT, and Tufts; Alpha Kappa Alpha admits students attending Harvard, MIT, and Wellesley.
Cultural Greek groups are not subject to the College’s sanctions because their membership spans multiple schools, according to Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman. One of the organizations held an event on Harvard’s campus as recently as April 2018.
The sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
Though cultural fraternities and sororities are exempt from the penalties, their single-gender status means they cannot receive official College recognition, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller wrote in an emailed statement provided by Goldman.
“Harvard College is committed to ensuring an inclusive student social life on our campus,” Miller wrote. “While we understand the cultural significance of these groups, our policy clearly states that we do not recognize single gender social organizations or fraternities and sororities, and therefore they are not recognized by Harvard College.”
While cultural Greek organizations are in part social groups, some of their events do not fit the popular conception of parties typically thrown by fraternities or sororities. Members go to church together, attend mental health discussions, hold clothing drives, and participate in slam poetry nights.
Both Alpha Kappa Alpha and Alpha Phi Alpha count several Harvard students among their members, according to the groups’ websites and Facebook pages. The two organizations have held several events on Harvard’s campus in recent years, per public postings on Facebook.
On March 30, Alpha Kappa Alpha held an event titled the “Smart Money Workshop” in Mather House’s Big TV Room. On April 7, Alpha Phi Alpha hosted an “A-List Networking Mixer” in Winthrop House’s Senior Common Room.
When asked about these groups’ use of Harvard-owned spaces, Miller wrote that “use of College-owned meeting and event space by unrecognized groups including single gender fraternities and sororities is not permitted.”
Alpha Phi Alpha and Alpha Kappa Alpha did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Though cultural fraternities do not appear to have changed their policies in response to Harvard’s sanctions, many other Greek organizations and final clubs have vowed to go co-ed to avoid the penalties.
Fifteen social groups, including two of the College’s former fraternities and all four ex-sororities, vowed to go gender-neutral and received College recognition — which exempts groups from the sanctions — on Sept. 7.
In the years since former University President Drew G. Faust debuted the penalties in May 2016, Harvard’s chapters of Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kappa Sigma became the co-ed groups the Aleph and the KS, respectively. And former sororities Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Alpha Phi became the gender-neutral groups Kali Praxi, Theta Zeta Xi, the Fleur, and the Ivy.
These changes left Harvard with only three fraternities and no all-female social groups. A handful of the remaining single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations are taking the fight to the nation’s capital and lobbying Congress to imperil the College’s penalties.
Correction: Sept. 25, 2018
A previous version of this article referenced a sorority called "Kappa Kappa Alpha," which does not exist. The article meant to refer to Harvard's chapter of sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma, which recently became the gender-neutral group the Fleur. The story has been updated.

The Adams House Committee and members of the House met Monday night to discuss possible changes to Drag Night, a long-standing Adams tradition that dates back to 1980.
The annual event has its roots in a gesture of solidarity with a gay member of Adams House who was harassed by another student at the College. A Drag Ball was thrown to show support, and by the 21st century, the Ball had evolved into a performance event for all.
At a previous HoCo meeting, someone asked where the event originated, prompting Monday night’s meeting to discuss why the tradition endures and the direction it may take in coming years.
In an email invitation to the House, Bailey Q. Colfax ’19 and D. Brady Stevens ’19, the Adams HoCo co-chairs, wrote “at this past HoCo Meeting, there was a concern raised about Drag Night being an event that has outgrown its original purpose, and which needs to be reexamined 38 years after its creation.”
The two explained that this week’s informal meeting may later lead to a town hall, in which the entire House could participate to more clearly determine Drag Night’s future and whether changes need to be made to the tradition.
In their House-wide email, Colfax and Stevens quoted Robert C. Gunzenhauser ’15, who wrote that the night would be the one event he would attend if he could relive his sophomore year.
“On a House-Wide level, there is nothing like it at anywhere else at Harvard,” he wrote. “Beyond its appeal to our desire for entertainment, Drag Night symbolizes so much of who we have been in the past, who we are today, and what we hope for in the future of our community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Allston Task Force, a neighborhood advisory body for issues related to Harvard’s development projects in Allston, held a meeting Monday night to update Allstonians on Harvard’s progress in providing “community benefits” and on its plans for future development in the neighborhood.
In light of the fall 2020 opening of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex in Allston, Harvard has been ramping up its involvement in the neighborhood.
Such involvement includes community outreach programs such as the Harvard Ed Portal, a service initiative in Allston which was founded in 2008 and has grown significantly since. Other programs work to connect Harvard undergraduates to Allston-Brighton students in grades 3-12 and to provide housing for low-income members of the community.
Mark Handley, director of community relations for the University, presented Harvard’s annual report on its progress in “cooperation agreements” with the city of Boston. He highlighted the inaugural Winter Market, an event which brought “over 4,000 people through the doors of the Ed Portal” to celebrate products from local vendors, as well as Arts First, Harvard’s annual festival to showcase student art, which expanded into Allston for the first time last spring.
Members of the task force had high praise for Harvard’s commitment to making these programs successful. Allston resident Tim McHale applauded the University on some of its recent projects.
“You guys crafted an amazing project here,” he said. “I’m really surprised how much effort you put into this. I know it’s been building, but seeing this connection, I’m very impressed.”
This work can be translated to other universities pursuing similar development in areas where they are expanding, according to John A. Bruno, chair of the task force, who praised Harvard’s continued integration into Allston as a “model for other institutions in the country and world.”
Some residents said they hope to meet with Harvard’s new president, Lawrence S. Bacow.
“He’s expressed a lot of interest in Allston, he’s acknowledged a lot of the work of the task force, the IAG, etc.,” Tony P. D’Isidoro, a lifelong Allston resident, said.
Handley said in response that Bacow’s back-to-school schedule is packed with events as he begins his first year leading the University, adding that hopefully Bacow could attend an Allston event in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The matchup between Harvard and Brown is always an interesting one. The latter is convinced a rivalry exists and the former treats it like any other game. When the Bears host the match, students from both schools meet to tailgate — an anomaly in the Ivy League.
But it’s been said that rivalries don’t exist unless there is at least a little bit of parity, and the Crimson (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) had defeated Brown (0-2, 0-1) in seven consecutive instances. Last weekend, the story didn’t change as students tailgated and Harvard outshone the temporary lights at Brown Stadium, defeating the home team 31-17.
MOMENTUM KILLERS
Friday night’s tango was less of a one-sided match than the box score indicates. If not for some stellar third down performances by the Crimson, a momentum shift in the final quarter nearly granted Brown the tying score.
Even from the first drive of the game all the momentum was completely on the Bears’ side. Not only was it the team’s first home game of the 2018 season, but it was against Harvard. Brown received the opening kick and sophomore quarterback Michael McGovern went to town. He accounted for every play in the first drive, either passing the ball or running it himself. The sophomore leader took the team 65 yards, to the Crimson 10-yard line, in 12 plays. Two incomplete passes later the field goal unit replaced McGovern and three points lit up the Bears’ half of the scoreboard.
That seemingly innocuous first drive later proved deadly for Brown.
“We got away with just a field goal,” Bears coach Phil Estes said. “We should have had a touchdown in that first drive and what a difference that would have made and the kind of momentum [we would have had]. We need to create those kinds of momentous situations so that we can get up from the first drive right to the last drive.”
Three minutes and six snaps later Harvard scored, establishing a lead it would not relinquish for the remainder of the night. Down 3-7, the Brown offense returned to the field only to jog back off after three plays. The Crimson offense similarly jogged off after three plays, only it left with six more points on the board.
“You take out that first quarter of the game, we beat that team, 100 percent. Even the first 10 minutes,” said Bears junior tri-captain Michael Hoecht. “We all know it.”
EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST COACH
Quarterback Jake Smith isn’t a freshman anymore.
One year after the sophomore made his debut as the first freshman quarterback to take starting snaps under Harvard coach Tim Murphy since Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05, the sophomore returns to the fray and there is no question: Smith is the guy.
Smith has begun the season very well, showing few signs of his youth and playing like the second year starter that he is. The play caller boasts a 70.6 percent completion rating and 446 yards over the first two matches — not bad considering sophomore Aaron Shampklin ran for four touchdowns and 178 yards in team’s home opener.
More impressive has been his game management skills. Smith displayed good pocket awareness in the prior two games, avoiding sacks, throwing on the run and throwing the ball away when it was merited.
Smith’s maturity was on full display in the fourth quarter on Friday night. The Crimson led, 24-10, and was driving down the field when Smith aimed at a receiver inside the Brown 10-yard line and was intercepted. McGovern completed three of the next four consecutive passes — for 55, four and 29 yards — to earn the Bears seven more points. The home crowd stood to their feet, the Brown players on the sideline jumped around and sprayed water in the air. There had been a clear momentum shift in favor of the Bears, and now just seven points away, a comeback victory wasn’t so far-fetched.
Harvard started the drive at its own 13. Smith hit senior receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley for eight yards and then Shampklin lost one on a run. Third and three on the Crimson 21-yard line. Smith found senior tight end Dan Werner for four yards and the kept the drive alive. The sidelines quieted.
In the next three consecutive sequences, Harvard faced similar third down challenges. Each time, Smith found the open man and moved the poles, never stuttering and never mistepping in the high-stakes drive. When Smith eventually found senior receiver Adam Scott in the endzone for exclamation point, the silence in the stadium was deafening.
The drive bled eight minutes off the clock and with only four minutes remaining, the match was all but won for Harvard.
“He’s always like this,” said Murphy drawing a steady straight line in the air with his hand. “He doesn’t get too high, he doesn’t get too low. He had a couple of picks that he probably didn’t need to make but he just stays the same — he keeps his poise, he keeps fighting and I thought this was a step forward for him in terms of how he managed the fourth quarter.”
SOPHOMORE SQUADRON
In a press conference after San Diego, Murphy called Shampklin and his roommate, sophomore running back Devin Darrington, “thunderbolt and lightfoot.” Shampklin then made a cryptic comment about the difference in the running style between the two.
“Teams have to game-plan for both of us,” Shampklin said. “And then we also have a lot of other great running backs in the backfield that you guys haven’t even seen yet, so once they come out there, teams are really going to have to game-plan against that.”
Perhaps Shampklin was previewing another sophomore, B.J. Watson. In Friday night’s game, Watson rotated in for snaps alongside Shampklin and Darrington. Once, Watson took the ball and ran 43 yards to the house, scoring his first career touchdown.
The depth of the Crimson’s backfield might be the best in the Ivy League. The team has three solid running backs, all of which boast touchdowns in the first two games.
It’s worth mentioning Harvard’s presumed preseason starters have not yet seen game action due to injury. Both seniors Charlie Booker III and Semar Smith have been absent, but the Crimson ground game has not flagged. It presents an interesting quandary for Harvard’s opposition.
“I don’t know if you guys watched last week but [Shampklin] ran for 178 yards and four touchdowns,” Estes said. “He was running like he was running through butter against San Diego. We held him under 100 and no touchdowns.”
Which is true. It’s also true is Watson ran for 73 yards and a touchdown while Darrington tacked on 66 yards more. Harvard still tallied 237 rushing yards against Brown, only 29 yards fewer than it did against San Diego.
