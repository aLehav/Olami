After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday morning, I received the news that President Donald Trump promised he would not be taking away the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. This program, from which I benefit, was announced by President Obama in 2012. It allows undocumented students like myself to apply to receive a work permit and protection against deportation. Because of its temporary nature as an executive order, I, along with many others, feared that it could be taken away at any moment as Trump promised in his campaign.
The news came hidden in the rescission of DAPA: another proposed executive order that would have granted  a similar protection for parents of children who are citizens and permanent residents. Hearing the news, I felt nothing but anger and wondered why my initial reaction was not happiness. So many doors that had threatened to swing shut in my face as I passed through them were now held open. I could theoretically study abroad, continue to work normally, and live my life without the fear that I would be deported.
I say that this is all theoretical because there have been many cases of people with DACA who continue to be criminalized. After going through the lengthy and expensive process of obtaining DACA and the screening of criminal records, it served them no good under this harsh administration.
Daniel Ramirez Medina was detained for over a month despite having DACA. We also recently heard the story of Juan Manuel Montes who was the first person with DACA to be deported. Not even DACA can protect us from being treated unfairly. Despite this uncertainty, I do acknowledge that it grants us several privileges that others do not have.
I think more about what this means for myself, but the anger remains. I can’t be happy because, even if I am safe, injustices remain in my community. The only thing Trump’s statement on DACA shows is that the divide that already exists in my community continues to grow. Students who are viewed as overachievers continue to be seen as more deserving of basic human rights. The creation of DACA gave an indication that this sentiment was true. Now, the failure to retain DAPA alongside DACA proves it. This goes hand in hand with Trump’s hypocritical idea that he can support DACA while maintaining the notion that he will build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Although we should praise the immense amount of work and activism from the undocumented community that got us here, this is certainly not a time to be thanking Trump. I would be acting selfishly by doing so. As a "DACAmented" student, I cannot forget the millions of others who continue to feel unsafe in this country. We can’t celebrate or take solace in the promise  that we should be safe for the next few years. The handful of rights I am granted by the U.S. government is still far out of reach for many others.
I cannot forget all the people who are eligible for DACA but cannot afford to pay its high application fee of $465. I cannot forget all the students who call this country home, just as I do, but are ineligible to apply for DACA themselves because of arbitrary arrival time restrictions. I cannot forget the parents who held out hope for DAPA so they could provide a better future for their children. I cannot forget the parents, mine among them, who see no hope in attaining these rights in their own near future.
We must remember the people for whom it’s too late. We must remember the people who have already been deported. We must remember the families that have been torn apart. We must remember that our community continues to be criminalized. Having DACA does not make us immune to any of these hardships. Not even citizenship can protect people who come from mixed-status families from knowing that they could lose their parents at any moment.
We must continue to fight until the rights necessary to live a life without constant fear are granted to everyone in the undocumented community—not just the ones lucky enough to be getting an education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After graduating seven seniors, the Harvard men’s hockey team enters the summer looking to fill a large void. And with the announcement of an eight-man incoming freshman class, the Crimson appears to be on its way to doing so.
The hockey program, coming off a campaign decorated by Beanpot, Ivy League, ECAC, and East Regional titles en route to the team’s first Frozen Four appearance since 1994, published Thursday that it will add the octet of rookies.
All eight skaters are American, and they represent six different states. Five are forwards, while three man the blue line.
At commencement this spring, Harvard took a hit in its forward ranks, losing six impactful players. These fourth-years were mighty in not only number but also skill. The Crimson’s class of 2017 notched the most points of any senior group in the country with 193. What’s more­, the majority are pursuing professional careers, whether abroad or in the National Hockey League (NHL) and American Hockey League (AHL).
With the graduation of 2016-2017 co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, the Crimson’s only pair of brothers was broken up. Younger sibling Colton, who remains on the squad as a rising sophomore, is seeking a larger role in Harvard’s forward corps this season.
But the 2017-2018 season brings another brotherhood in the locker room. Scituate, Mass., native Jack Donato, son of Crimson coach Ted ’91 and brother of rising junior Ryan, is among the incoming eight Harvard skaters. Donato has spent the past four years representing Dexter Southfield and the Cape Cod Whalers hockey program.
Joining Donato in the forward ranks is Jack Badini of Greenwich High School and the United States Hockey League’s (USHL) Chicago Steel, for which he served as an alternate captain in the team’s Clark Cup championship season. A large piece in the Steel’s title run, Badini tallied the most points in the playoffs. Before hoisting the hardware with the Steel, Badini played for the Lincoln Stars along with a fellow Crimson recruit Henry Bowlby, who joins the program from Edina, Minn.
Rounding out the rookie forwards are Mitchell Perreault from Findlay, Ohio, and Benjamin Solin from Madison, Conn. Perrault concluded his 2017 junior season with the Sioux Falls Stampede in the USHL, while Solin led his Phillips Exeter Academy team in points in 2016 before doing the same in 2017 as a rookie for the British Columbia Hockey League’s (BCHL) Nanaimo Clippers.
On the blue line, Harvard brings on another Edina native in Benjamin Foley, who captained the USHL’s Cedar Rapids Roughriders last season. The other two rearguards joining the program next season are Nick Azar, a Grosse Pointe, Mich., dweller who played for the USHL’s Tri-City Storm in 2016-2017, and Reilly Walsh, who hails from Andover, N.H.
Walsh ranked as high as 60th on Central Scouting’s final list leading up to the NHL Entry Draft and played alongside Badini as a member of the Steel in 2016-2017. The Proctor Academy product also played for Team USA in the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament.
