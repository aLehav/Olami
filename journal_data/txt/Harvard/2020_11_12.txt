After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’ve spilled a lot of ink on the importance of participating in the democratic process, from voting in national and local elections to internal union and University overseer races. Occasionally, we tell people how we think they should vote as well. But when it comes to the ongoing Undergraduate Council elections, for which voting ends on Thursday, no ticket has convinced us. Rather than endorse a candidate, we’ve opted to run through their strengths, some spots of disagreement, and signs of trouble for the system as a whole.
Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 and Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 are running on a ticket better grounded in the reality of virtual life, with a platform that addresses students' needs in the COVID era. Providing printer access to students living on campus, reporting courses held on the “wellness” days meant to replace spring break, and advocating for more recorded lectures are all policy initiatives on this ticket’s platform that we think would have a tangible positive impact on the upcoming virtual semester. Suggestions like these are notably absent from their opponent’s site.
At a high level, we appreciate the Ganesh-Brennan ticket’s idea-driven campaign. Campaigns with vague platforms helmed by big personalities are basically a UC Election trope at this point. The more detailed plan Ganesh and Brennan offer stands out.
But among these detailed ideas, there are some duds. The Ganesh-Brennan ticket wants Harvard to put more emphasis on finance and consulting, going as far as saying Harvard should create a concentration devoted entirely to finance (isn’t Economics practically already there?). We’re hesitant to endorse a ticket that, in response to nearly half of undergraduates going into finance and consulting, thinks expanding these field’s presence on campus is the answer. We believe deeply in the importance of the liberal arts education and have encouraged students to explore careers in public service, academia, and other pathways beyond the well-trodden corridors to finance and consulting. A wealth of resources already exist to help funnel finance and consulting-inclined students into their careers of choice, while other students often languish in uncertainty. A finance concentration is emphatically not the solution to any of the problems we see on campus.
The other fully human ticket (the third ticket includes a cat), Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22, deserves credit for the work they’ve done reaching out to campus affinity groups. The fact that 13 cultural organizations are endorsing the Harris-Gan ticket indicates that they’ve been meeting widely with these student groups. This proactive choice to tend to community relations may better equip them to champion causes that are close to these students’ hearts. It also reflects well on Harris and Gan’s priorities: good leadership requires constant dialogue with constituents.
Still, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that the entire Harris-Gan platform is around the same length as Ganesh and Brennan’s “At a Glance” summation of theirs: the Ganesh-Brennan site features 9 additional pages of plans. As we found ourselves wishing Harris and Gan had left us more to mull over, they dropped a campaign ad in the tradition of outgoing UC heads James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 viral campaign video.
However students vote, the election should be decided by substance rather than flash. The outgoing UC president and vice president won their election — but lost the popular vote, earning less first-choice votes than their competition — after celebrities like Dwayne Wade and Kerry Washington helped their campaign music video go viral. These celebrity endorsements meant little, however, when fractured and confused advocacy on COVID-responsive grading put the dysfunction of the UC on full display this spring. A memorable “grading ‘fiasco’” ensued, in which the UC released three policy reversals in roughly 24 hours and an un-endorsement. All this to say: there’s nothing wrong with trying to reach people in engaging ways. Just please, read the tickets’ platforms, no matter how good any candidate’s song is.
The threads of virality, venality, and political infighting seem here to stay this year. Harris and Gan were prohibited — by the UC — from campaigning until late last week because the UC Election Committee determined that they began campaigning too early. Their campaign contends that their early outreach was targeted at friends who might help plan the larger campaign ahead, and in line with normal historical UC practice. No matter who you believe, the UC pointing its finger at itself paints an unflattering picture of the body.
Ganesh has also written on her campaign website about facing gender-based harassment during her time as a member of the UC. We commend her for having the courage to speak up: gender-based and other forms of harassment have no place in our community. Such allegations undermine the student body’s faith in the UC as a place for effective leadership at a much deeper level. In her platform, Ganesh writes that “The UC, as we all know, is not a very pleasant place.” If a UC presidential candidate characterizes the body she’s hoping to run this way, how are students supposed to put trust in it?
That faith was already frayed thin. The election last year was a clear demonstration of massive disillusionment among the student body, as evidenced by the popular-vote success of Aditya A. Dhar ’21 and Andrew W. Liang ’21 — a former Crimson Business associate — which was formed as a single-issue campaign to abolish the UC. Their humorous style and raw popular success betrayed the broadly cynical, bemused reception the UC enjoys in the student body. Mr. Muffin, the write-in, feline candidate, continues this tradition.
Though we, too, are amused by Mr. Muffin and the long history of UC election antics, we still see potential for a UC that pushes for change from the administration on bread-and-butter student life topics and meaningfully supports student activism and advocacy. From where we’re sitting this future seems sadly distant. Whoever wins the election will have a difficult task: instilling confidence and engagement in a system that has long been plagued by indifference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 29, Giang T. Nguyen, executive director of Harvard University Health Services, emailed me to request my participation in Harvard’s pilot COVID-19 testing program for off-campus students. “With your participation in this pilot,” he wrote, “you will help us in our ongoing work to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the health and wellbeing of our Harvard community.”
To that end, the University sought to conscript “approximately 500 undergraduates currently living in Allston, Arlington, Belmont, Brighton, Cambridge, Malden, Medford, Newton, Somerville, or Watertown” into their public health regime, bringing the shadowy exiles under the great eye of the Q-tip.
I warily accepted the offer the day before the deadline, and in under a week, I received a package on my doorstep with eight testing kits — one for every remaining full week of this seemingly interminable semester.
My wariness was a product of resentment. I felt — still feel — somewhat neglected by the University. Not that I’m really into the whole college-as-parent idea, and I recognize that the College is limited, like all institutions, in what it can do now. But for all the talk of Harvard as home, the College — beyond my academic responsibilities — is fairly absent from my life. Some days, I feel like I’ve already graduated and am just checking off the last boxes for the diploma.
A recent Crimson op-ed astutely noted that the promised “Harvard Everywhere” program doesn’t really seem to be anywhere. And the Editorial Board, which I co-chair, ran a staff editorial calling out Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for an email subject-lined “Checking In” that ironically seemed to highlight just how little checking in there actually has been.
Living just off campus brings that all the more powerfully home. Walking through Harvard Yard as anonymously as a tourist leaves me with a bitter sense of uncanniness, estrangement in a place of so much familiarity.
Of course, I couldn’t be that bitter about eight free COVID-19 tests. Though Nguyen had framed it as my contribution to the community, it was equally Harvard’s contribution to me. University President Lawrence S. Bacow has made it very clear that these tests aren’t cheap — “tens of millions of dollars” spent already. Frankly, I’m not all that sympathetic. Instead, staring at the eight tests, I felt something more akin to guilt. The self-righteousness of “What about me?” — the sense that my mucus was more valuable than my actual presence — quickly soured into the self-loathing of “Why me?”
What other 500 people might benefit from eight contact-free, super-speedy antigen tests? Essential workers? Medically vulnerable demographics? How about the approximately 555 homeless Cambridge residents?
In fact, the city has said it will not be able to shelter as many homeless this winter due to social distancing requirements. Though I am no expert, it seems like a problem testing access could at least partially mitigate. What if we substituted the 500 students Harvard has decided to test with 555 homeless residents? Imagine what the city could do with those tests to limit transmission and increase capacity in shelters.
And make no mistake: Testing right now is zero-sum. What Harvard kids get, others don’t. Testing shortages have to do not with distribution so much as with a lack of the necessary reagents to process kits, a problem faced by two-thirds of United States labs and hitting the least privileged the hardest.
By a twist of numerical coincidence, the fact that the privilege of us 500 Harvard kids seems to rest precisely on the suffering of the 555 Cambridge homeless becomes painfully apparent. If my ilk and I form a sort of Harvard shadow campus — a ghostly presence that hovers around Harvard, both part of the community and not — the homeless live in the shadow of that shadow.
The world around Harvard seems to unfold in layers of notedness — levels of visibility, realms of worthiness. Of course, that’s always the case. I think of the homeless men of color brutalized by Harvard police officers in the Smith Campus Center. I think of the banquets in Annenberg not a stone’s throw from the hunger in the Square. I think of students happily blazing along the river, while opioid overdoses among the homeless rage across New England. I think of The Crimson crisply stacked in entryways and the man selling copies of Spare Change. COVID-19, as with so many things, brings these contrasts into relief.
And in that sense, those twin questions — “What about me?” and “Why me?” — don’t sit well together. They leave me with a strange cognitive dissonance: to feel at once neglected and overly privileged, to feel both that the University is failing me and that it is failing the world by serving me too lavishly.
But COVID-19 has also opened up the possibility that they are not actually separate questions — that, in fact, the failures of Harvard in aspects of caring for its students is inextricably linked to its failure to share its resources more justly with the world. When the University assumes that care for its students is merely a matter of resources and spending, it both further instantiates wealth and resource inequality and fails to provide its students with the intimate, invaluable guidance and support they need. But when it spreads that wealth around, divests in some profound sense from the injustices it rests upon, it will also force itself to more deeply reckon with what students might need.
A couple of caveats: First, I’m fortunate to have a lot of incredible professors and graduate student mentors who have supported me personally and academically through this and so many previous semesters.
Second, care isn’t free. The University, for example, has long struggled to martial the financial means to meet mental health counseling needs.
But mental health counselors, while vital, are only one pathway toward student wellbeing. Arguably more important is a culture of flexibility, shifting values about how students should spend their time, and more holistic and longitudinal advising. The happiest, most engaged students are not necessarily those at the wealthiest, most spend-happy institutions. And, in fact, the relationships I’ve had with faculty and graduate students make that all the more clear. Still, there’s more (and particularly more reflection) that should be done.
The transition to online education with no reprieve in tuition costs has rightly inspired many to ask why a Harvard education needs to be so exclusive in the first place. Any valid defense of a small College community can no longer proceed strictly from the academic experience itself; it has to attend to these questions of care and intimacy. And any meaningful defense will help students reconcile that paradox of the undergraduate condition: so privileged and yet so distant from a certain sort of care; so desperately aware of the fact that our education is premised on the exclusion of others and yet to some extent excluded ourselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first checked my on-campus mailbox this year, I was surprised to find, alongside three COVID-19 tests, a hard-bound Class of 2024 journal. The journal — courtesy of the Harvard Journal Project — is black with an elastic band and ribbon bookmark, features a textured Veritas Shield on the front, and smells like fresh newsprint on a winter morning.
Such journals were distributed, either in on-campus mailboxes or by national or international mail, to all 1,415 freshmen who enrolled this year. Many students may cynically see such journals as superficial or pointless, but as someone who’s journaled off and on since the second grade, I think they’re brilliant.
An overarching theme of life, especially at the intersection of college life and pandemic life, is the irrefutable presence of uncertainty. Uncertainties are everywhere, from the monumental “How will I make a difference in the world?” to the trivial “Does the guy who lives on the floor above mine like me?” and everything in between: potential concentrations and pandemic reopenings, incomplete blocking groups and political races. Everybody worries and wonders, and nobody knows.
By no means do I have the answers to any of these questions — I am in fact the second-most indecisive person I know — but I am able to collude with and confront them in my now-daily journals.
Take an excerpt from my entry from Oct. 2: “What do I want out of my education? ‘Thinking critically’ as a phrase may have lost any semblance of meaning, but I am hoping to gain that ability to persistently and creatively consider propositions.”
Or Oct. 23: “It’s Friday again, which means yet another slight lag between set objectives and catching up to them.”
Or Nov. 7: “I awoke to honking and cheering and handbells and a lightness I haven’t felt in a long time.”
In his compiled Letters to a Young Poet, Rainer Maria Rilke writes, “[H]ave patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.”
Within our journals, we can live those questions. Or at the very least, we can parse their clauses.
Journaling serves the twofold purpose of memory-catalyzing and life-analyzing. In terms of remembrance, writing down my experiences amplifies them. When I return to my dorm, I replay conversations from walks along the Charles and reconsider philosophical debates about personal turning points or social media motivations or faith in altruism. In terms of introspection, journaling allows me to do all the ruminating and intellectualizing that daily life often brushes aside. Together, this twofold process of remembering and analyzing has helped me crystallize personal discussions and value systems.
The Harvard Journal Project affirms that work. The Journal Project began as an opt-in program two years ago. Freshmen were encouraged to select red or black journals at the Student Involvement Fair, with opportunities to share their thoughts (if desired) with other students, Dean of Student Life Katherine G. O’Dair, or Senior Assistant Dean of Residential Life and First-Year Students Nekesa C. Straker. Students were then encouraged to take ownership of personal transformation, inspired by Seymour Papert’s constructionism learning theory. Constructionism encourages students to discover and create their own mental models of learning in a sort of bricolage, which comes from the French word for creating through tinkering.
This year, the journals are accompanied by a series of online reflection prompts that have spanned civic engagement, community-building, and environmental awareness. So often, a university education is seen as a means to an end: a series of concentration requirements, a crucial grade for a premed application. The Journal Project takes a step back from these variable disconnected plot-points to explore elements of a successful educational transformation. It promotes a sort of bricolage — one that’s nonlinear and open-ended.
But even beyond remembering and analyzing personal uncertainties, I think journaling should inform our interactions with each other. To me, journal entries are micro-experiments, private exercises in empathy, a sort of sparring with oneself. When you journal, you treat your conflicting opinions with improvisatory grace and gingerly entertain ideas amid emerging plans. If we all journal, perhaps this practice will be extrapolated to larger educational and societal discourse, where it’s often so easy to ignore or oversimplify the thoughts and motivations of others. Journals are extraordinarily intimate ventures to recognize multiple perspectives within ourselves. Analogously, on the scale of public discourse, we can recognize that others feel, think, hurt, and love as we do.
Harvard students, in defense of the Journal Project and for your own enlightened revelations, I encourage you to journal. Whether you choose to follow the weekly newsletter questions provided or subscribe to your own series of inquiries, taking ownership of your life experiences in writing is valuable.
In less than two weeks, most of us living on campus will move out. Less than two weeks after that, the fall term will be over. So, what happened? What does it all mean? Where are you now, and where will you be headed next? Journal, and you may join the ranks of Marie Curie’s diligent reporting and Mark Twain’s whimsical imagination and Thomas Edison’s careful mundanity. Your current selves will benefit from the analysis, and your future selves will savor the memories.
My friend George never journaled before receiving his Veritas 2024-emblazoned journal from the Journal Project. He now writes, in incomplete sentences and annotated punctuation-reactions, people-focused entries that analyze motivations and implications of new interactions here on campus.
George told me he’s sure his journaling is worthwhile. Aside from better understanding uncertainties, it’s also just nice to catalog accumulated experiences. It’s nice to know that this is all real.

“Today’s poker is different from the poker played five, ten years ago,” says Aaron W. Chen ’22, founder and co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Poker Club. Chen refers to what’s known as the “Moneymaker effect” — poker’s boom in popularity after accountant Chris Moneymaker won the 2003 World Series of Poker without being a professional gambler. “After Moneymaker made poker more mainstream, people started devoting more time and resources into studying poker and fleshing out the theory,” Chen says.
The complexities of poker are what drew co-president Dasha Metropolitansky ’22 to the game in the first place. “I picked up a few pretty simple poker math books and realized very quickly that this game, which you can learn in ten minutes, was infinitely more complex than I thought it was,” Metropolitansky says. “I just love that poker teaches me how to stay calm under pressure. I love that it teaches me how to deal with uncertainty. I love that it teaches me how to manage risk, all while just having a great time and meeting other people.”
The club, founded last spring by Chen, Nic Xu ’20 and Anders Angerbjorn ’20, aims to create an inclusive space for students of all skill levels to learn about poker. HUPC offers workshops once a week and runs games twice a week. These workshops are open to all, but since so many new players have expressed interest this semester, the club has started with beginners. Metropolitansky says the workshops “really [teach] the fundamentals of poker from the ground up.” The club hopes that by aiming these workshops at beginner players, they will be able to include those who do not have prior experience with the game and build up a strong and diverse base of poker players at Harvard.
On Nov. 7, the club invited world poker champion Maria Ho to speak to the club about her experience as a professional player.
“She’s one of the best female poker players, but she is also one of the best players in the world, period,” Metropolitansky says. “In 2018, 3.8 percent of the competitors in the World Series of Poker Main Event were women. In 2019, that number was 4.1 percent — so still constantly below five percent, which is kind of crazy,” she continues. “A big goal of our club is just to make sure that people feel that they have a community of people like them who are there to support them.”
Historically, Harvard’s poker scene has existed underground and largely consisted of men; in a 1967 Crimson article, a poker “shark” on campus claimed that “women are poker’s worst enemy. Women and poker just don’t mix. They play just like they drive.” By inviting such a prominent female player to speak, the club hopes to move beyond the perception of poker as a male-dominated activity and create a space at Harvard where anyone can get involved with playing poker, no matter their identity or background.
The same article details instances of huge financial losses on the part of students, including one “ who gambled away a semester’s allowance in a night. Then he put his Lotus Elan and his title (he was a Baron) on the table — and lost them both.” HUPC hopes to remove all financial burdens by hosting tournaments with no buy-in — students don’t have to pay to join games. To do this, the club has two sponsors: Citadel Financial Group, and Susquehanna International Group.
“Sponsors provide us with money and funding for a tournament and in return they receive resumes from our members; they’re allowed to have recruiting events,” Chen explains. “So it’s a pretty transactional relationship.” Chen and Metropolitansky note that firms, especially hedge funds,are looking to recruit people with the kinds of skills one can learn from poker: the ability to stay calm under pressure, manage risk, and make decisions in the face of uncertainty.
The club has received an overwhelming amount of interest from Harvard students studying remotely. When Chen first sent out an interest form, over 200 people replied, and over 100 RSVPed to their event with Maria Ho.
The interpersonal aspects of poker, which can be lost online, are something that the club is striving to retain even when it is forced to meet on Zoom. Despite an entirely virtual semester, HUPC creates Zoom rooms during the biweekly games so that players can still converse and get to know one another between hands.
“This is just the beginning,” Metropolitansky says. “I think a lot of people want to play poker and want a place to do it consistently, and I think that’s even more true now with the pandemic — people are at home, they miss seeing their friends and having fun, and this is a great opportunity for people to do something that doesn’t have to be done physically or in-person.”

E. K. Smith ’24 is running late. After hefting a box full of goodie bags to the top of the Widener steps, they sit down and hastily begin taping condoms to a piece of cardboard: Lubricated, Ultra Thin Lubricated, Stimulations Ecstasy Ultra Ribbed, Magnum, Magnum BareSkin, G, and Nirvana. They quickly scrawl “CANDY & CONDOMS” across the front of the sign in black sharpie.
It’s Halloween, and Smith spends the next hour and a half handing out goodie bags to students, picking them out of the box and confidently striding down the iced-over steps in one-inch platform heels to meet new arrivals. Each goodie bag contains the usual items: candy, Halloween toys, and of course, four Trojan brand condoms.
Back in September, Smith submitted an application to The Condom Collective, a collaboration between Trojan Condoms and the nonprofit Advocates for Youth that aims to distribute condoms on college campuses and advocate sexual health awareness. A few weeks later, a box of 500 condoms arrived at the mail center. For Smith, giving them out with candy on Halloween seemed like “a really fun way” to encourage safe sex practices.
“It was like going trick or treating on Halloween, and that was pretty awesome,” says Sarah P. McDonald ’24, a freshman who stopped by to pick up a bag. Later, she and her friends traded candy and condoms — there were seven different types, after all.
Each bag contains lollipops, Starburst, bubblegum, a plastic jumping spider, a temporary tattoo, and four condoms of different kinds. Smith purchased everything but the condoms, assembling 100 bags over the course of a few days. For McDonald, that extra effort helped make grabbing condoms a community activity.
Around campus, McDonald noticed fellow students sporting Halloween-themed temporary tattoos. “People would put them on and you just know where they got the Frankenstein tattoo from,” McDonald says. “It was all over Snapchat; everyone had tattoos. So it was a community-binding thing. We bonded over condoms.”
Smith also typed up and printed out slips of paper explaining how to put on a condom, how to make dental dams out of condoms, and where to find more sexual health resources from Harvard’s Sexual Health Awareness and Relationship Communication Educators. Because high school sex education curricula vary widely, Smith thought including instructions could help fill any gaps in students’ knowledge.
“As far as the sex ed that I got in school, there definitely wasn’t any information about how to put on a condom, and the words ‘dental dam’ were never mentioned,” Smith says. “And also when I’ve talked to people, especially two people with vaginas who are having sex with each other, they don’t know that dental dams exist or they don’t realize that there is a risk of STI transmission. So it seemed really important to spread that awareness.”
Dental dams are thin sheets of latex used to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infectionss during oral-vaginal and oral-anal sex. Smith points out that dental dams tend to be far more expensive and far less accessible than condoms, so they especially wanted to explain how to convert condoms into dental dams. (Snip off the tip and cut a line up the side.)
For Smith, handing out condoms with instructions felt like a natural continuation of their work in high school. In their freshman year, they revived their school’s defunct Genders and Sexualities Alliance group, making it a space for both advocacy and the discussion of safe sex practices. Smith says that BGLTQ+ advocacy and sexual health advocacy largely overlap, partly because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic’s historical legacy and its disproportionate impact on queer and trans communities.
“It’s become central to a lot of LGBTQ+ advocacy. If you go to any pride parade, you will leave with a bunch of condoms,” Smith says with a chuckle. “I think it’s been ingrained into the culture.”
In their junior year of high school, Smith founded the Central Texas GSA Coalition with the goal of providing social spaces and resources for BGLTQ+ students. When the nearby Austin Independent School District prepared to vote on a new third through eighth grade sex education curriculum — one that would include topics like sexual orientation, gender identity, and STIs for the first time — Smith mobilized the Coalition to support the policy change, organizing a press conference and testifying before the school board. Despite opposition and a decade-long struggle that preceded the decision, the school board voted unanimously in favor of the curriculum.
June K. Park ’24, a student on campus who also picked up a goodie bag, believes schools need to move toward a more inclusive sex education like the one Smith helped enact at AISD.
“Oftentimes, sex ed is taught in a very heterosexual blend,” Park says, which is “harmful for queer-identifying students” and “[normalizes] that heterosexual sex is the only sex possible.”
She was actually surprised to find that a student was even handing out condoms on campus.
“In my high school this would have never happened,” Park says. “This openness to talking about sexual health was just refreshing.”
That openness is exactly what Smith hopes to promote here at Harvard. They believe that talking about sex is the first step to lessening the harmful stigma surrounding it.
“The stigma around sex is why people don’t have access to sexual healthcare and the reason that people don’t feel comfortable asking questions,” Smith says. When people are not empowered to make sexual health decisions, they don’t make use of all the available tools to keep themselves healthy and safe, they explain.
“I personally don’t have a problem with being open and vocal and visible when it comes to sexual health awareness,” Smith adds. “Because I think it’s something that we as a society need to really destigmatize and be more open about.”

Immy V. Humes ’80 is late for class. From her room in the Co-op on Sacramento St., she rushes through Cambridge Common to make it down to the Square. Up ahead in the grass, a crowd surrounds a ragged looking fellow. It’s a familiar sight around Harvard in the seventies. Immy does all she can not to be recognized.
The center of attention was Harvard Square’s resident “peripatetic scholar,” Harold L. Humes ’54 — but you can call him Doc. Class was in session in the Common that morning when Immy spotted her father. Doc was hosting one of his lectures as a self-appointed visiting professor to the University, and today’s agenda was taking in the “lenticular clouds.”
From 1973 to 1990, Humes lived out his final years as a magnetic fixture of Cambridge. Wherever Doc went, people followed. Whenever Doc talked, people listened. He was full of charm and new ideas, with every cop and every student drawn to keep an eye on what he did next.
These followers, “Docolytes” as they called themselves, came in the second iteration of Humes’s adventure of a life. Before the 1970s, Doc was a two-time critically-acclaimed novelist, founder of The Paris Review, aspiring filmmaker, campaign manager, and graduate from the Harvard Extension School with a (now discontinued) Adjunct of Arts degree. He moved from New York to Paris to Rome, finding a calling in marijuana advocacy, massage therapy, and inventing a house made of paper.
This life, as a 1977 Crimson profile put it, was one also plagued by manic episodes, paranoia, and strained relationships with those closest to him. Following a 1965 LSD mega-overdose with psychologist and psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary, Doc was left debilitated. He began hearing voices and thinking he was being followed. Eventually, his paranoia necessitated that he receive treatment from a mental hospital in London while his family moved to the United States.
Immy Humes is one of Doc’s six children. She not only bore witness to her father’s “classroom” at Harvard, but is the creator of “Doc,” a 2008 portrait film that revisits Humes’ history to make sense of the legacy he left.
Four years after his hospital admission in London, Immy heard her mother whispering on the phone about an article on her father in The New York Times. Finding her mother had cut the piece out of the family’s copy of the paper, the four Humes girls ran down to a newsstand on Broadway to read the story, which told of Doc’s reincarnation as a Columbia University “hipster visionary neo-prophet.” This tag — coined by then student, now novelist Paul Auster — reflected Doc’s new habit of taking unofficial residence at colleges. At Columbia, he handed out $50 bills to anyone who happened to pass by.
From New York, he moved on to Princeton and then Bennington College, eventually settling back in at Harvard, his alma mater, where his daughters Immy and Alison enrolled in the seventies. Some combination of his formidable paranoia and vibrant intellect had undergraduates clinging to his every word. Doc taught about the ways that protests, art, massage, and marijuana can preserve freedom in the fight against the institutions that rule society. At night he bounced around, living in Harvard dorms, at hotels, or with different constellations of University students in Cambridge apartments. When he wasn’t attracting followers with his lectures — “raps” as they were known — you could often find Doc playing chess in the Square.
But this peripatetic lifestyle got Doc in trouble at times. In the spring of 1975, he was living on a couch in a Straus Hall suite. His daughter Alison recalls that as finals came and went that year, the students left. Doc, however, did not, and the University administration kicked him out.
“Puts a frame around the wreckage” were the words that Harold Humes jotted down in London in the late sixties as he moved through mental health treatment centers. He was trying to write a third book, an autobiographical science fiction story of sorts about an author going mad. The novel would never be finished.
At the end of his life Doc reconnected with the family he had neglected for so long. Devin, his youngest son, summed it up at Doc’s funeral in 1992, Immy recalls from the service: “He’s no ordinary asshole.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a month after the Malkin Athletic Center reopened to those living on Harvard’s campus, students and staff say the pandemic-era gym largely feels safe, though its new systems and safety protocols pose some challenges.
The MAC officially reopened Sept. 28, adopting safety protocols approved under current state and local COVID-19 guidelines. To use the gym, students must book hour-long workout sessions, which are interspersed with 30-minute disinfection periods. Safety protocols require everyone to wear a face covering while using all parts of the center except for the pool, according to the Harvard Recreation website.
Harvard Recreation staff member Ariel E. Wahl said reopening took “a lot of work in the summer” in order to adhere to Cambridge’s social distancing guidelines. Campus Services’s Environmental Health and Safety arm also needed to approve all health protocols, according to Wahl.
“We had to reorganize all the weights and make sure that everything was distanced enough, because here in Cambridge, for cardio, it has to all be 14 feet apart, which is very limiting because we have very small spaces,” she said.
Emily R. Dobrindt ’24, who uses the pool and the gym in the MAC, said she feels “super safe” in the facilities under the COVID-19 health protocols.
“They’re doing a great job. They're really doing the best they can,” she said. “It's so much better than having to go to another gym or finding somewhere else.”
T. William McQuiston Jr. ’24, who also frequents the MAC, agreed the space feels much safer than other gyms in Cambridge, thanks to “extensive” cleaning measures combined with Harvard’s broader success in preventing the virus’s spread.
Apart from the frequent cleanings, Octavia I. Tyagi ’24 said limits on the MAC’s capacity have helped her feel safe while working out.
“There’s usually no one even anywhere close to you. I usually don’t even see other people,” she said.
But the gym’s reduced capacity combined with the first come, first served allocation of machines and space have also presented a challenge, some students say.
“You can only have three people in each weight room,” McQuiston said. “There’s only two weight rooms, so if you’re not one of the first six people, you can’t get a weight room.”
Though Dobrindt said she has never had trouble booking a gym slot or finding a treadmill, she said accessing the pool can be difficult.
“You have to book like a week out because the slots go so quick,” she said.
While other workout options are available, McQuiston added that it is “really, really hard to get any serious cardio” while wearing a face mask.
“I enjoy it,” he said. “If anything, I just wish they would loosen up some of the restrictions or add more weight rooms.”
“But I understand that they kind of have their hands tied behind their back,” McQuiston added.
Despite limitations due to Cambridge and Harvard COVID-19 regulations, Wahl said the recreation staff is hoping to “work out other options” to improve students’ experiences, like a reservation system specifically for the weight rooms.
“We’re trying,” Wahl said. “We will hopefully have something better by spring.”

The Cambridge Police Department has recorded a 4 percent increase in crime from last year with a total of 2,035 serious crimes this year, though the total remains slightly below the city’s five-year average, according to CPD’s monthly crime report.
Despite an increase in certain crimes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, police have recorded seven fewer serious crimes — including murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft — than the five-year average of 2,042 incidents as of early November.
Violent crimes — which encompass homicide, rape, robbery, and aggrevated assault — also saw a 3 percent decrease, with 238 incidents reported compared to 246 at this time last year.
This year, Cambridge witnessed its first and only murder since January 2019. In April, police arrested Jose Bermudez on accusations that he stabbed and killed Danilo Perez, a homeless man living in Central Square. Bermudez is being held without bail, according to the CPD monthly report.
CPD also recorded six shots fired incidents, none of which resulted in injury. Last year, police noted 10 shots fired incidents through the same time frame, with one resulting in a non-fatal injury.
Robberies decreased by nine reported incidents — approximately a 15 percent drop — to 52; 43 of those robberies were classified as street incidents and nine were classified as commercial robberies.
Similarly to last year, Cambridge has not seen a bank robbery as of October 2020. Property crimes, however, did increase this year with a 5 percent upward trend when compared to the same time period in 2019.
The report identified increases in crimes that police linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, including bicycle larcenies, package thefts, psychiatric-related calls, and unemployment fraud reports.
“The surge of unemployment fraud reports that peaked in June, abated during the summer months, and has exploded over the past six weeks,” the report stated.
Larcenies in bicycles saw an increase of 59 percent, as compared to the 5-year average, while psychiatric-related calls saw an increase of 83 percent when compared to 2019 data.

More than 40 Harvard alumni won seats in Congress in this fall’s elections, with disproportionate representation among the Democratic ranks.
While control of the U.S. Senate remains undecided, Democrats are projected to retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives, as well as regain the White House.
In the Senate, there were at least seven candidates who are alumni of one of the University’s twelve schools, six seeking re-election. Five of the six will remain in their seats for another term: Sen. Dan S. Sullivan ’87 (R-Alaska), Sen. Ben E. Sasse ’94 (R-Neb.), and Law School graduates Sen. Tom B. Cotton ’99 (R-Ark.), Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), and Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.).
As for the House of Representatives, at least 40 alumni won their elections, 36 of whom were incumbents. Six are Republicans, while 34 are Democrats.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow often meets with members of Congress throughout the year to discuss the school’s priorities for higher education, including protections for international students, immigration, and research funding.
Biden’s ability to deliver on his own policy agenda — much of which aligns with Bacow’s — could be constrained if Democrats do not gain control of the Senate.
For instance, a reversal of the endowment tax and a boost to funding for Harvard’s research labs would likely have to come from Congress, which has the power to levy taxes and allocate government money. A Democrat-controlled Senate would be much more likely to do so, given vocal opposition to the tax from many in the caucus, including former Law School professor and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.).
Nonetheless, Biden could attempt to reinstate the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status program, although he may face legal challenges in doing so. An extension of the programs would provide relief to hundreds of Harvard students and workers who have faced uncertainty about their immigration status during the Trump administration.
Before the elections, many experts predicted that the Democrats would be able to take control of the Senate and expand their majority in the House. But Congressional Republicans outperformed expectations on election night, securing at least 50 seats in the Senate and flipping multiple seats in the House, despite remaining in the minority in the chamber.
Control of the Senate now lies in the outcomes of Georgia’s two runoff elections, which will occur on January 5th, 2021. The Democratic nominees in Georgia will have to win both races for the Democrats to obtain a majority in the Senate.
Kennedy School graduate and Republican Maria Elvira Salazar was the sole Harvard alumnus to flip a seat, beating Rep. Donna E. Shalala (D-Fla.) in a close rematch of their 2018 midterm election race.
Not all Harvard graduates proved successful in their races. Kennedy School graduate Martha E. McSally, Arizona Senator and Republican incumbent, lost her reelection bid in a close battle with Democrat Mark E. Kelly. It was McSally’s second loss in a Senate race in two years.

The city of Cambridge began offering free, daily COVID-19 testing with expanded locations at the beginning of this month, as part of its Cambridge Pandemic Collaborative initiative to coordinate COVID-19 testing and vaccine distribution.
Residents can now get tested for free seven days a week across the four sites, up from two days a week. Testing is available at CambridgeSide Shopping Center on Sundays and Thursdays; the Pisani Center every Saturday; 50 Church St. on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays; and St. John the Evangelist Church on Wednesdays.
Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob said increasing testing availability has been one of the city’s “central strategies” in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
“Over the course of the last eight months, we've been trying to at least make access to the COVID test more available to residents,” Jacob said. “Since early April, we've administered over 18,000 tests.”
“We believe that Cambridge is one of the few, if only, the Massachusetts communities offering city-funded COVID testing to all its residents,” he added.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said the city’s testing program has been well-received, but only offering it two days a week was not enough to meet the demand.
“The appointments would go very quickly, but if you were kind of in the know, or you had been in the past, you knew that you could walk up and get a test even if you didn't have an appointment,” she said. “For the mayor and myself and my colleagues, we all felt that that was very exclusionary and it was possibly not getting to the residents that we know are being disproportionately affected by the COVID virus.”
“We really felt that it was important to expand testing [to] seven days a week and make sure that it was available for everybody who needed an appointment,” she added.
Mallon said it was particularly important to ensure racial and geographic equity in testing availability. COVID-19 case rates are higher among Black and Hispanic Cambridge residents than among white Cambridge residents. Additionally, some Cambridge neighborhoods have seen higher COVID-19 case rates than others, particularly East Cambridge, the Port, and Wellington-Harrington.
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said there is a “missing link” between residents who are utilizing testing and those who are impacted by the pandemic.
“We are doing testing in the neighborhoods that are impacted by COVID, but how many residents are actually — who is utilizing testing?” Siddiqui said. “I think that data point is something that I know CPH is working on getting and analyzing and I think that will be illuminating.”
Both Siddiqui and Mallon said ensuring information on what it means to get tested reaches all neighborhoods — especially those that have been disproportionately impacted by the virus — is critical to the city’s response.
“We have to think about creative ways to get people to go get tested and understand why they're not,” Siddiqui said, citing a video she has used to address fears and misconceptions surrounding testing.
Mallon cited the importance of informing residents about the testing experience itself.
“The tests are very, very easy right now — it's just a Q-tip that goes just on the inside of each nostril for five seconds,” Mallon said. “It's over within 10 seconds, it's non-invasive. It's very, very quick.”
In addition to increasing the availability and utilization of testing among Cambridge residents and employees, Jacob said encouraging proper social-distancing behavior and relying on a data-based approach composed the pillars of the city’s efforts to mitigate the virus’s spread.
“We're really trying to at least help influence the behaviors,” Jacob said. “It's a new norm for folks to wear a mask or facial covering, to maintain the appropriate social distancing, but also really being more diligent with hand washing and hand hygiene.”
“We depend on the data, so that's why we've been trying to at least share, every night, the updates,” he said. “We keep a close eye and keep track of where we're seeing some of the reported cases, the clusters, and we work with those facilities in those neighborhoods just to make sure that we minimize the disruption and spread of the virus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School celebrated the launch of the Ideation Hub and the Translator — two key components of the school-wide Therapeutics Initiative — in a virtual symposium Oct. 28.
Launched in 2019, the Therapeutics Initiative is an interdisciplinary endeavor to help translate researchers’ scientific discoveries into medicines with direct impacts on human health.
Harvard Medical School Systems Biology professor Timothy J. Mitchison serves as director of the Ideation Hub, which will focus on early-stage aspects of the initiative including team building and educating Medical School researchers on the drug discovery process. Mark N. Namchuk, the executive director of Therapeutics Translation at the Medical School, directs the Translator, the branch of the initiative geared towards helping with execution once teams and ideas are formed.
In his remarks at the symposium, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said the initiative aims to foster “rigorous, collaborative science” that will solve major challenges to human health.
“One of my foremost priorities is to cultivate and enhance the impact of our community’s research,” Daley said. “We wanted to remove as many obstacles as possible and provide the resources needed to propel promising ideas into new medicines and therapies.”
The initiative is supported by a $200 million gift from the Blavatnik Family Foundation to Harvard Medical School in 2018, which has funded an array of research endeavors at the Medical School including programs in single cell sequencing and structural biology.
In his speech at the symposium, Len Blavatnik, head of the Blavatnik Family Foundation, said the initiative underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration.
“This type of effort shows how much you can move forward through interdisciplinary collaboration in research, which is the key to modern science,” Blavatnik said. “I think you’re really making great strides in breaking down the silos.”
Blavatnik also said better drugs are needed “sooner and faster,” highlighting the importance of the initiative in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its international impacts.
Namchuk said in an interview that while the pandemic has hampered some aspects of the initiative, it has also led to an unprecedented amount of cross-disciplinary collaboration between institutions and labs.
“One thing I'm really passionate about is making sure that we can support projects that are between disciplines, between institutions so that they can find a home within the therapeutics initiative,” Namchuk said. “It was a phenomenal opportunity to see how those sorts of projects were set up, work with a broader group of people, and show that it can work.”
That type of work will be the main focus of the Translator, including the hiring of industry experts as senior therapeutic scientists who will provide experience in drug development to help researchers at the Medical School in their translational research, according to Namchuk.
He also said these scientists would serve as mentors for graduate students and postdocs who may be interested in careers in drug discovery.
“If you're a grad student or a postdoc and you want to learn from somebody who's been doing it for 20 or 30 years how that process works and how the science works and how your idea can begin to grow towards something like that, these would be super people to connect with,” Namchuk said.
While the Translator will focus on aiding researchers in the execution of their projects, the Ideation Hub focuses on building collaboration between scientists at the Medical School.
Mitchison said the Ideation Hub is forming Disease and Technology Groups, bringing together researchers from a broad range of expertise with a common interest in specific translation research problems.
“To really make an impact in drug discovery even in early stages, we think it’s going to work better if faculty and research groups work in teams rather than just individual research groups working by themselves, which is kind of the norm at Harvard,” Mitchison said.
At the time of the launch, two groups had already been formed to focus on Lyme disease and COVID-19. A partnership with pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc. supports the latter group.
Namchuk, who worked in drug discovery and served in leadership positions in industry before joining the Medical School in January, said his experience in those roles helped him understand that “science has to breathe,” and ideas need room to grow.
“You need to understand when it's time to color inside the lines and when it's time to let yourself color outside the lines because the idea is just pulling you there and it’s a really good place to go,” Namchuk said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-sexual assault advocacy student-group Our Harvard Can Do Better called on University officials in a Tuesday email to exempt on-campus students who report sexual violence from penalties associated with violating COVID-19 health guidelines.
The amnesty policy would shield students who report witnessing or experiencing sexual violence from consequences stemming from violating residential safety measures. The emailed proposal — which was obtained by The Crimson and sent to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair — also advocates for extending the College’s “Help-Seeking Policy” to students seeking medical treatment for the effects of alcohol or drug use who may have violated social distancing guidelines.
Before arriving on campus this semester, College students living in Harvard’s dorms signed a “Residential Community Compact,” agreeing to follow social distancing rules and other safety guidelines.
To enforce the Community Compact and review alleged violations, the College formed a Community Council, which is composed of an equal number of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members. Associate Dean of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Brett Flehinger and Meghan Lockwood, who advises the College Dean's Office on issues related to COVID-19, serve as co-chairs of the council.
Students found in violation of the Community Compact are subject to non-disciplinary consequences, including a warning, “community responses” such as education, and loss of housing.
In their Tuesday email to University officials, members of Our Harvard Can Do Better wrote that they had been unsuccessful in lobbying the Community Council to adopt their proposed policy.
“As student organizers, we have been working with Meg Lockwood and Brett Flehinger from the Community Council to enact this measure. However, Meghan and Brett have informed us that the Community Council does not have the authority to do so,” the email states. “For this reason, we are asking you directly that the appropriate body at Harvard amend its policies to guarantee amnesty for survivors of sexual violence.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on behalf of Flehinger and Lockwood.
The absence of an amnesty policy could “dissuade reporting of sexual- and gender-based violence,” according to Will M. Sutton ’23, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better.
“Even though the Community Council says they’re non-disciplinary, it goes up to losing your housing, which is a pretty severe penalty even if it’s not on your disciplinary record,” he said.
Our Harvard Can Do Better member Sanika S. Majahan ’21 said the possibility of facing Community Council actions also places students who have experienced sexual violence at risk of “retraumatization.”
“Anybody on campus that’s at risk for sexual violence is at risk for further consequence or retraumatization under any kind of Community Council proceedings or any further proceedings that take place regarding COVID safety guidelines,” she said.
Mahajan said the group was inspired by student organizers at Stanford University who successfully persuaded their administration to codify amnesty for those who experienced sexual assault in the university’s campus compact in September.
In addition to its email, Our Harvard Can Do Better is encouraging students to put pressure on administrators to adopt the amnesty policy. Last week, the group published a list of its demands to its Instagram account along with a sample email template.
“Our focus really is making this a really prominent student concern so that either the Community Council is forced to consider it as something within their power or the University feels enough pressure to pass this on a University-level,” Sutton said. “We’re not sure which comes first.”

A pair of judges for the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday morning that, while the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions had standing to sue Harvard, the University's race-conscious admissions processes do not violate civil rights law.
The ruling affirms a holding last fall by District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who also favored Harvard's defense after a three-week-long trial in Oct. 2018. It comes less than two months after the appeals court fielded oral arguments.
First Circuit judges Jeffrey R. Howard and Sandra L. Lynch wrote in their opinion that Burroughs correctly decided several key components of the case, including that Harvard did not engage in racial balancing and that the University considered race-neutral alternatives.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University welcomed the ruling.
“Today’s decision once again finds that Harvard’s admissions policies are consistent with Supreme Court precedent, and lawfully and appropriately pursue Harvard’s efforts to create a diverse campus that promotes learning and encourages mutual respect and understanding in our community," she wrote. "As we have said time and time again, now is not the time to turn back the clock on diversity and opportunity.”
SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014. On Thursday morning, the group indicated its legal battle with the University will continue.
SFFA President Edward Blum wrote in an emailed statement that he was “disappointed” by the First Circuit ruling.
“Our hope is not lost,” Blum said in the written statement. “This lawsuit is now on track to go up to the U.S. Supreme Court where we will ask the justices to end these unfair and unconstitutional race-based admissions policies at Harvard and all colleges and universities.”
