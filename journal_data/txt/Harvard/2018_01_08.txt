After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard Economics professors say the current high valuation of bitcoin—the founding  coin of the international virtual currency boom—is unsustainable and will eventually drop, thanks in part to government regulation.
Bitcoin is an electronic, or “crypto” currency, started in 2009, which operates independently of a central bank and exists only as a series of transactions on its server, “blockchain.”
In the early years, bitcoin was worth comparatively little, ranging in value from five to 20 dollars. But in the past two years, the price of a single bitcoin has spiked to more than $20,000 before falling back to around $16,000.
Economics professor Kenneth S. Rogoff, a cryptocurrency expert, said the currency’s present high valuation depends on its “near-anonymity.” This anonymity has permitted various criminal or illicit activities through bitcoin markets since the currency’s inception in 2009, including drug dealing, unlicensed gun sales, and donations to hate groups, he said.
But that anonymity may soon end—Rogoff said he thinks governments will probably want to identify bitcoin users in the future. “Small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies…would be desirable,” Rogoff said, but “large-scale anonymous payments would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.”
He pointed to China as an example of a nation that has already banned bitcoin exchanges. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Rogoff warned that Japan, which “has enshrined bitcoin as legal tender,” could risk “becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven—with bank-secrecy laws baked into the technology.”
Economics professor Jeffrey A. Miron, a libertarian economist, said he disagreed with the suggestion that bitcoin technology’s lack of a footprint makes it riskier than traditional paper currency.
“We’ve seen the transformation of all sorts of industries from being on paper or in some physical unit to being all electronic, and nothing bad has happened. Indeed, a lot of good stuff has happened,” he said.
“There’s no reason the government should be concerned about means of payment that are not regulated by the government,” he added.
Miron also disputed the notion that bitcoin is too-often used for illegal transactions. He particularly mentioned the drug trade, noting those selling illegal drugs were able to use government-backed currencies "for centuries" before the invention of bitcoin.
Nonetheless, he said he is not optimistic that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will remain unregulated.
“It [government] could let cryptocurrencies peacefully exist, and not accept them as a means of payment, and that’s what I think it should do,” Miron said. “But my guess is that sooner or later governments are going to regulate cryptocurrencies out of existence.”
Even if governments do not regulate bitcoin out of existence, Rogoff said he thinks the currency—as well as its competitors like Ethereum, Ripple, and Monero—will eventually fall in value thanks to government interference.
“What the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates,” Rogoff said. He predicted that, ultimately, central banks will create their own currencies and “use regulation to tilt the playing field until they win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Members of Harvard’s chapter of all-female Kappa Kappa Gamma have disaffiliated from their national organization and formed a new gender-neutral social club called the Fleur-de-Lis, its president Tiana M. Menon '19 announced Monday.
Kappa—the third sorority to come to Harvard—is the first campus sorority to go co-ed since the College announced its social group penalties in May 2016. The sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from receiving campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
Menon directly attributed the group’s decision to go co-ed to the College’s penalties in an email Sunday.
“The May 2016 policy presented the opportunity for our group to critically think and converse about our place on Harvard's campus and collectively determine our path forward,” Menon wrote in the email.
Menon  wrote that College administrators had played a significant role in pushing the group to adopt gender-neutral membership practices.
“The formation of The Fleur is the culmination of numerous discussions spanning the last two or so years within Harvard’s Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma and with the administration,” she wrote. “[Administrators] have helped shape the path we as a group have chosen to pursue.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana praised the club's decision to go gender-neutral in an emailed statement Monday.
"This kind of positive change is made possible by our students' leadership in creating environments and cultures rooted in respect and inclusion," he wrote. "As members of this community, we all have an opportunity to strengthen our culture both for current students and future generations, and I applaud the Fleur-de-Lis on their efforts."
Menon did not directly answer a question asking whether members of the Class of 2021 who join the Fleur will be subject to the College's penalties. She wrote in a press release on behalf of the group Monday that the Fleur will welcome the Class of 2021 by ensuring its members "remain in good faith" with the sanctions.
The Fleur plans to hold its first round of recruitment, open to College students of all genders, in late January, Menon wrote in the press release. Though the Fleur plans to accept men, it will remain a “female-focused group,” according to the press release.
Asked what that female focus might look like, Menon pointed to a Frequently Asked Question page on the Fleur’s new website.
“Being a gender-neutral club means that we will never deny membership to our organization to anyone on the basis of gender,” the FAQ page reads. “Our mission is to create a safe, empowering space for female-identifying individuals on campus.”
“We’re excited to welcome anyone to our recruitment process that is similarly excited, regardless of their gender,” the page continues.
Though all-male social groups are immediately subject to the penalties, all-female groups will likely be allowed a five-year grace period as they transition to gender-neutral status under a recommendation accepted by Khurana in March 2017. That recommendation allows traditionally all-female final clubs and sororities to retain a “gender focus” for the next few years while complying with the sanctions.
The Fleur’s decision to disaffiliate comes soon after Kappa Kappa Gamma’s national chapter announced it was “profoundly disappointed” in Harvard’s decision to ultimately pursue its social group policy. Though Harvard seemed to waver in its commitment to the sanctions over the past year, at times seeking to revise the penalties, the University officially adopted the policy in Dec. 2017 following a vote by the Harvard Corporation.
In the wake of the vote, other campus sororities took a different approach, choosing to openly defy the College’s penalties. The Harvard chapters of Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta announced in a joint statement in December that they would proceed with standard all-female recruitment in the spring 2018 semester.
The Fleur's move to go co-ed and comply with the sanctions was not always certain, though—at one point in Sept. 2017, then-Kappa Kappa Gamma considered shutting down in response to the social group policy.
The Fleur is not the first of Harvard’s formerly single-gender social clubs to go co-ed. Earlier this semester, all-male fraternities Kappa Sigma and Alpha Epsilon Phi broke ties with their national organizations to form the co-ed KS and the Aleph, respectively. The Oak Club, the Sablière Society, the Seneca, and the Spee Club all went gender-neutral over the past three years.
Khurana said in a Dec. 2017 interview that the College will release an official plan outlining how it will enforce the sanctions sometime in January or February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first weekend of 2018, the Harvard wrestling squad was resolute at the Franklin and Marshall Open, taking three different divisions as the team heads into dual meet season.
Junior Nolan Hellickson (125 lbs.), sophomore A.J. Jaffe (141 lbs.) and senior co-captain Josef Johnson (174 lbs.) all captured their respective weight classes in a strong performance by the Crimson in Lancaster, Penn.
“Overall, we competed hard,” Hellickson said. “Really emphasized getting after our offense and just putting up points. Not necessarily having an outcome in mind, but just getting after it and scoring a lot in our matches and having a lot of output. I think that freed a lot of our guys’ minds and just use what we worked on in the practice room and really just let loose out there.”
Johnson successfully defended his weight class championship from last year, winning in a tiebreaker during the final round to secure his second straight championship. On the way to the final, he put up a 36-point differential over four games.
There were other similar displays of dominance. Hellickson won by six or more points in all of his matches. After his worst defensive performance in the first round (six points against), he rolled to the title by giving up no more than four points in any of his subsequent matches.
Jaffe went with a different route than his counterparts. While Johnson and Hellickson played the technical game of building up points against their opponents, Jaffe executed quick pins against two of his opponents, helping him ease to victory.
Going into dual meet season, Harvard was looking for a solid performance, especially after a underwhelming showing at Midlands last weekend.
“A tournament like this, bringing back three titles and a few other pretty solid performances, feels good rolling into dual season with a little bit of momentum,” Hellickson said.
The transition from tournament play to match play ushers in a different approach on the mat, both in terms of execution and atmosphere. Instead of each wrestler competing in brackets and playing five or six matches throughout the tournament, the teams face off by division once per match. There is a more intense, collective atmosphere present.
“A little bit more difficult, I’d say, to recover at tournaments, but being able to go through a day of five matches really builds our conditioning going into dual season,” Hellickson said. It makes that one seven-minute match very conceivable and allows us to mentally prepare for a lot of output in our seven minutes.”
The team-oriented play puts an emphasis on every single move as the teams scrap for points in the head-to-head matchup. Each weight class puts forward its best wrestler. Ten matchups, ten opportunities to pick up points for the team.
This inevitably means that not everybody on the team will be able to compete. The Crimson brought 19 wrestlers to the F&M Open and half will be on the sideline next weekend.
But with an emphasis on single matches, dual-meet season hardly sidelines the teammates that do not participate.
“I think that this tournament is great because we can bring darn near everybody and it gives an opportunity to guys that have been training, but don’t have as much experience in the line-up to get a lot of good matches in,” co-captain Kanon Dean said. “When you have everybody competing that feeds the team energy as we are going into dual meet season.”
Tournament season showcases individual performances, but it can also reveal the depth of a program. Harvard came in second in total pins (10), one behind Navy. The Crimson also recorded the second-most match points (395), just four points behind leading Binghamton.
As the second half of the season begins, the results of intrasquad competition will be revealed both through player selection and match performance. The tournament’s standouts certainly helped their cases, but the strong showing across the field shows the parity may not be too wide.
