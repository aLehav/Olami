After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Girls with plunging necklines and skin-tight miniskirts file out of a Mercedes-Benz sedan, laughing and dancing. This scene might sound like a typical weekend night out in Boston, but it occurred on the stage of the Boston Opera House—the first time opera graced its stage since 1990. On Friday, Sept. 23, Boston Lyric Opera premiered Georges Bizet’s “Carmen.” The show was the U.S. debut for director Calixto Bieito, who set it in modern-day Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish city in North Africa. Sultry and captivating, the opera, which ran through Oct. 2, managed to paint a comedic cover while staying true to the deeply-rooted passions of the story.
Compared with traditional productions of extravagant backdrops of Seville, the scenery throughout set the tone for a performance taking place in the present, beginning with a flagpole and phone booth standing alone on stage in Act I. A large bull head covered the background of Act II and III, suggesting the Toreador’s upcoming force. The tone was accented with blue hints from the lighting, foreshadowing the dark nature of the ending.
Generally, the modern setting is achieved effectively and adds a novel flavor to the opera. Mercè Paloma’s costumes were sensual, with simplistic trench coats for the cigarette girls and slinky getups for the Gypsies. The dresses and skirts that adorned Carmen were flattering and outlined her silhouette. The classic Mercedes sedans that rolled on stage were powerful and served as a perfect prop for the choreography. Some of the modern props, however, felt extraneous. It’s cute the first time Micaëla takes a flashing selfie with Don José, but the repetition of flashing cameras throughout scenes in the opera feels contrived.
Among many strong performances, baritone Michael Mayes looked as charming and confident in the role of Escamillo, the Toreador, as his voice sounded alluring. But the real musical highlight of the opera was soprano Chelsea Basler as Micaëla in Act III, with a thrilling delivery of “C'est les contrabandiers le refuge ordinaire.” Liam Moran as Zuniga and Vicent Turregano as Moralès were just as playful as Andrew Garland and Samuel Levine in the roles of the smugglers; Carmen’s gypsy girlfriends, played by Kathryn Skemp Moran and Heather Gallagher, were frisky and fun. Jennifer Johnson Cano executed the choreography brilliantly in the title role as Carmen, yet her voice sometimes lacked the fieriness that her body movements portrayed so beautifully. The mezzo-soprano did deliver an impressive “Habanera,” the opera’s most famous aria, however, and her “Seguidilla” was quite seductive.
Bieto’s characterizations were occasionally puzzling, even as the performers excelled in delivery. As an obsessive lover, tenor Roger Honeywell definitely revealed the psychological depths of Don José. But José was perhaps a bit too creepy, drawing away from the usual pity invoked by the character’s amorous downfall. Honeywell delivers clearly, and he shines in moments where desperation seeps from his voice. This problem is amplified by his relationship with Micaëla—or lack thereof. Unlike the traditional timid Micaëla, Bieito’s was bold and lustrous, even mocking Carmen as she convinced José to leave with her under the pretense that his mother is dying. Similarly, José’s complete lack of reciprocal affection in this production made it easier for him to go along with Carmen, weakening the inner struggle that is so important in developing his character.
Though an opera house doesn’t always see underwear thrown off and wild parties filled with provocative dancing on stage, Bieito’s “Carmen” is no more shocking today than what the original would have been in 1875. Overall, Bieito’s present day setting updates the opera for a broader and younger audience while still keeping the integrity of Bizet’s beloved score. The power of the staging lies in the fact that this is a reinvented work set so that a new generation can relate to and understand it. Traditionalists may say that Carmen needs no modernization, but if anything were to revive opera in the Boston Opera House, this would be it.

László Krasznahorkai’s “The Last Wolf” begins in a seedy, vacant bar in Berlin, where the unnamed protagonist, eternally sipping on a glass of Sternburg, recounts his tale of utter misery in a single 70-page-spanning sentence. Although this highly unusual stylistic choice may seem like an unnecessary gimmick—similar premises have been seen in novels such as “Gadsby,” a 1939 novel by Ernest Vincent Wright written entirely without the letter “E”—it in fact amplifies the desired overall effect of “futility, scorn, and misery,” a trifecta of words often repeated in the short story and also effectively impressed upon the reader.
The meandering plot of “The Last Wolf” abounds with circularities and dead ends, which further create the central feeling of misery. As the obese, solitary, completely forgotten philosopher protagonist receives an unexpected invitation to visit Extramadura, Spain, the narrator and the characters describe Extramadura as “an enormous, mercilessly barren, flat place,” “outside the world,” and “there was nothing there, nothing,” and it is his task to rescue it from oblivion. This invitation is intriguingly reminiscent of the morning arrest of Franz Kafka’s character Josef K.; as such, an interruption of the philosopher’s dreary existence seems completely random, a result of some massive confusion, for “there wasn’t anyone behind the [philosopher’s] name now.” There is a surprising sense of irony in the motive of the invitation— a prize, in contrast to the developments in Kafka’s “The Trial”—as it functions as punishment for the dejected philosopher. His misery increases as he cannot communicate to his hosts how inadequate he is to fulfill the task of reviving Extramadura, that equally forgotten piece of land. Still, through further complications and misunderstandings he does not try to rectify, his visit becomes a rather unmotivated quest to discover the fate of a group of wolves in the region—hence the title “The Last Wolf.”
Krasznahorkai utilizes third person narration, which creates detachment from the misery of the philosopher but masterfully retains the feeling of dullness that permeates his days. However, this technique, combined with the story’s monomanic punctuation and its general Kafkaesqueness, successfully causes it to come as a surprise when the story of the last wolves reaches an affecting— even tragic—climax. In particular, the last scene in Extramadura wouldn’t feel out of place in an Almodóvar film, as it is distinguished by a strange, cruel kind of humor (and Krasznahorkai is no stranger to translations of the sort—his collaboration with the filmmaker Bela Tarr on the widely acclaimed 7 hour film Sátántangó is another exercise in stretching the limits of an artistic form).
On the other hand, “Herman,” alternatively also titled “The Game Warden” and “The Death of a Craft,” tells the story of the titular, extremely skilled gamekeeper. After miraculously (given the increasing obsolescence of his profession) being employed to clear up a neglected part of a forest, he reaches an epiphany upon one day seeing a fox brutalized by his traps and starts using his extraordinary skills for a more sinister purpose.
The story, far less sparse in style than “The Last Wolf” and more conventional in its punctuation, still reaches an equally tragic climax, but with hints of divine redemption in its first part. However, the second part retells the story from the first section through the perspective of a group of officers, which eventually leaves the Christian divinity of the first part challenged. This is a fascinating development that creates the sense of confusion characteristic of Krasznahorkai’s writing.
The setting of “Herman” and its historical context are also compelling: It was originally published in 1986 and depicts the Hungarian countryside with its conflicts of delayed yet upcoming modernity. This theme manifests itself in one of the alternative titles—”The Death of a Craft”— and serves as one of the looming tragedies in Krasznahorkai’s description of Extramadura. Conversely, “The Last Wolf” was written in 2013, and its setting is remarkable because of the political circumstances, as then there were only hints of the immigration crisis to come. Yet there were already tensions in European multiculturalism then, present in the motives of Kurdish graffiti and the disinterested Hungarian bartender in a misplaced bar in Turkish neighbourhood of Berlin. Furthermore, another intriguing aspect of the settings are their literary predecessors—a specific central European bleak atmosphere and the omnipresent tragedy of the mundane feel connected to Kafka in a yet another way.
Finally, the question of why “Herman” and “The Last Wolf” are being republished together might arise. The answer might lie in the fact that "Herman" often entertains the idea of a clash with nature, which is far from absent in “The Last Wolf,” intertwined with the threat of approaching modernity. This clash yields ambiguous results but leaves the reader admiring the radical yet skillfully crafted stories.

It may seem hard to identify a common thread throughout “Root/Void,” the latest album by MV & EE (the duo Matt Valentine and Erika Elder). From the subtle Indian raga roots that greet the listener in the debut track, “love lemma > herb slang,” to the blues and folk undertones in the subsequent “much obliged,” the Vermont-based experimental duo craft an album from a mosaic of genres and instruments. Yet despite the seemingly overambitious premise of welding raga, blues, folk, rock, and psychedelic electronic music into a cohesive sound, MV & EE deliver an enlightening musical experience.
This fluid mosaic is present in “love lemma > herb slang,” where repetitive flanging and reverbing build upon raga influences to invite the listener to enter the metaphorical void of “Root/Void.”  Like most songs on the album, “love lemma > herb slang,” has numerous instruments playing at any given moment, punctuated by multiple electrical guitar solos and the sustained flanging of a sitar. Compared to the others, this track leans more towards an Eastern influence than the other seven. After this opening, the album transitions into a blues ballad in which the singers express their appreciation “for all the things you do.” Even the vocals are copiously reverberated, creating the effect of a chorus singing along.
The most abrupt shift in the album follows with “no $ (shit space – it’s all about the coin ¢ /corn),” where MV & EE adopt a psychedelic electronic experimentalism that stands out from the other tracks not only for the instruments used (synthesizer and keyboard) but also in the lyrics themselves. Whereas the other tracks often refer to love and/or gratitude in a soothing style with dreamy Auto-Tune and vocal reverberations, “no $” is about how the singers “gotta have coin,” with harsh layering of the electrical guitar. If anything, the usage of symbols, lowercase, and abstract language within the song title is indicative of the experimental nature of the track.
The first three aforementioned tracks showcase the album’s greatest diversity in themes, instruments, and genres. The remainder of the album sways towards folk and country music—background birds and crickets chirping in “love is everyone > TOAOB” inhabit the same space as the electric guitar and electronic psychedelic music. If there’s anything constant in this track, it is the repudiation of orthodoxy in music genres as the sounds bleed through. The songs’s titles follow this same pattern of repudiation of orthodox paradigms of contemporary music.
What is consistent throughout the album, however, is its subtle classic rock influence. The repeated use of the electric guitar in solos anchors the eight tracks and allows MV & EE’s to merge different genres seamlessly. As a musical group that weaves genres into what it has described as “free folk,” “jam band” and “lunar ragas,” MV & EE create a kaleidoscope through which to examine the themes of love and money.
The album concludes with “i’m still in love with you love > void,” a track that has an eerily similar beginning to the debut track “love lemma > herb slang.” Thus, the cyclical nature of the album perpetuates the notion of an endless musical void the listener is first invited to experience in the first opening track. However, not much else is similar between them, as “i’m still in love with you love > void” has a country sound that eventually fades into an experimental psychedelic electronic sound similar to that of the third track, “no $.”
Ultimately, MV & EE set out to create an album that further refines their self-described free folk style. The duo manage to further explore the bizarre yet enrapturing intersection of country folk, Indian raga, and psychedelic electronic music. While their distinct sound may confuse first-time listeners unsure what to expect, it delivers an rewarding break from the expectations of what an experimental album can become.

At first glance, “Masterminds” seems like just another “blockbuster comedy,” where the camera sits unenthusiastically—almost angstily—as familiar, overlit faces pass through and improvise outrageously. Depending on the relevancy of the faces, the camera will pan down to reveal the butts associated with those faces, butts that will proceed to fart grandiosely; other times, the camera will draw back and capture these same butts becoming acquainted with the ground in a most painful fashion. It is a foolproof formula—a tradition at this point—and one that “Masterminds” is undoubtedly indebted to. Yet here’s the twist: Jared Hess is the director. Best known for his debut, “Napoleon Dynamite,” Hess has devoted his cinematic career to his cruel fixation on outsiders with diminishing returns. “Masterminds” thus distinguishes itself from the homogeneous glut of mainstream comedies with its eye for awkwardness and absurdity. But the eye doesn’t take it far.
“Masterminds” depicts the 1997 Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery in North Carolina (inspired, the film posits, by the 1997 Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery in Florida), wherein a Loomis Fargo employee named David Ghantt lifted $17 million dollars from a vault at the behest of former coworker (and crush, according to the film) Kelly Campbell and her friend Steve Chambers. Chambers then convinced Ghantt to flee to Mexico to hide until the authorities lost interest, at which point Ghantt would return to collect his share of the spoils. Inevitably, Chambers cut Ghantt out, even sending a hitman named Michael McKinney after him, whom Ghantt improbably befriended before the assassination could occur. Meanwhile, Chambers and his wife spent the money freely, quickly alerting the FBI and winning arrests and convictions for all involved. The robbery became a punchline throughout the nation, earning the name “the hillbilly heist” due to the ineptitude and the hometowns of the co-conspirators.
“Masterminds” zeroes in on the “hillbilly” aspect of the original story, distributing fleeting Southern accents and gauche tastes to its ensemble. The cast consists of some of the funniest actors working today, utilized to varying effect. Zach Galifianakis stars as Ghantt, sporting an impressively pronounced bowl-cut and a perpetually pained smile. Galifianakis can pull off broad comedy effortlessly, a skill which catapulted him to fame in movies like “The Hangover.” Executing pratfalls and delivering oblivious one-liners with aplomb, he consistently strikes Hess’s intended tone, especially with his fumbling advances to Kristen Wiig’s Kelly Campbell, which include kissing her shoulder and letting her carve her number into his arm with a pencil. Yet Galifianakis’s greatest talent is giving such jackassery an edge that brings dynamism to otherwise one-note characters—just listen to Ghantt scream with sarcastic laughter after his fiancée, Jandice, jokes about his weight. Kate McKinnon’s brief time as Jandice is a similar pleasure to watch, her placid creepiness perfectly complementing Galifianakis’s earnest ungainliness; Their stilted engagement photo session, set to the strains of “Only Time” by Enya, is a high point. However, McKinnon’s spell is broken late in the movie by a tiresome brawl with Wiig, which ends with heavy misuse of a vaginal cream.
The fight scene encapsulates the flaws of “Masterminds”: squandering a peerless cast in service of pointless wackiness. Wiig, for instance, is sadly underserved by her role as Campbell; she is far too sharp to be stuck as the mere love interest, whose defining quality is her cleavage and whom the posters for the film tellingly refer to as “The Bait.” Owen Wilson is also miscast as Steve Chambers. Though he adds interesting layers to the character, he seems far too good-natured to convincingly portray a sleazebag. Meanwhile, Jason Sudeikis as hitman Michael McKinney and Leslie Jones as FBI Agent Scanlon steal every scene they’re in, and yet they barely have screen time. Sudeikis, who gets (understandably) pigeonholed as the ultra-likable everyman, clearly relishes the opportunity to play a psychopath; his performance is perhaps the most magnetic in the whole film. Jones, meanwhile, has a monopoly on quips (her evaluation of a picture of Ghantt: “He looks like Kenny Loggins and Kenny Rogers had a baby, and then Kenny G showed up to the birthday, played the flute, and just messed him up”) in a movie where a dialogue that isn’t obviously improvised sounds forced.
Indeed, it seems impossible that the actors are working off a script (written by three people, no less). Oftentimes, the film feels like production consisted of leaving the cameras rolling as the actors improvise in amusing getups, clutching paper napkins on which vague plot points are hastily scrawled. The getups are in fact amusing, and the actors are capable, charismatic improvisers—but it’s all in service of nothing. “Masterminds” makes for a diverting hour and a half, but it comprises little else but dumb, awkward spectacle.

This past Sunday, some Harvard undergraduates received an unpleasant surprise in their inboxes: an email from the white supremacist hate group “Educators and Students Against White Genocide.” The message—with the subject heading “Fight White Genocide - Vote Trump!”—was as deluded as the name of the organization that sent it would suggest. In brief, it argued that “‘diversity’ means chasing down the last white.’”
No one has yet invented language strong enough to condemn such bizarre and dangerous ideas. The intrusion of this odious racism and hatred into the Harvard community is of course unfortunate, but what is more unfortunate is that such rhetoric has been on the rise in parts of the country we too often dismiss as not relevant to our own lives. This email underscores just how alarmed we should be that views like these still find any significant audience anywhere in the United States, or indeed anywhere in the world.
While it goes without saying that this email’s contents are a reflection of a twisted worldview, we wish to highlight one of its assumptions that deserves particularly fierce rebuttal: the idea that the United States is a country for white people. Besides its failure to acknowledge that powerful Native American civilizations peopled this continent long before Europeans set foot on its shores, this view also fails to acknowledge the African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and countless others who have built this country and who, in many cases, have been here just as long as Americans of European descent, if not longer. To erase them from the nation’s history is historical malpractice of the highest order.
But to address the contents of this email in the terms of traditional historical analysis or discourse is nearly laughable. This email glorifies the most disgusting and shameful parts of our country’s history. There is no reason for them to return from the depths of the past.
Of the email’s many disturbing qualities, however, by far the most worrying is its invocation of a major party’s presidential candidate to render racist views mainstream. Rhetoric like this is not only wrong on its face; it is also a threat to the foundational ideas that have animated this nation’s history, to the future of a republic whose constant pursuit of a more perfect union has inspired people around the world, and to an increasingly diverse nation that has always struggled to find strength in difference. It has no place in a race for leader of the free world.
All candidates should renounce any groups that hold that Americans of non-European descent have less of a right to this country than their fellow citizens, and any campaign should find it disturbing that avowed white supremacists consider its rhetoric encouraging. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has already made it abundantly clear that she unequivocally disavows this sort of hateful rhetoric. We call on Donald Trump to do the same.

To the Editor:
We write on behalf of Harvard’s Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies to clarify a few issues raised in the October 4, 2016 Harvard Crimson article entitled “European Secondary Frustrates Advocates for Ethnic Studies.”
The secondary field in European History, Politics, and Societies was the result of extensive efforts which took more than three years. It was in part, a response to significant interest in European affairs expressed by Harvard College students over a considerable amount of time.  Moreover, it aimed to unify what had always been plentiful but fragmented course offerings on Europe at Harvard so that students could benefit from a guided and interdisciplinary plan of study.
CES submitted its proposal for a secondary field to Harvard’s Educational Policy Committee, which reviewed then approved its establishment for this academic year. We are pleased that in the first weeks of the secondary field’s inauguration, it already has strong enrollment.
Sincerely,Grzegorz Ekiert and Elaine Papoulias
Grzegorz Ekiert is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Government and Director of the Center for European Studies. Elaine Papoulias is the Executive Director of the Center for European Studies.

This week, HUDS workers are striking for affordable healthcare and a sustainable yearly income. They’re on the defensive, fighting to keep their current coverage as Harvard proposes massive cuts. It’s about economic justice and how Harvard treats the lowest-paid, hardest-working folks on campus. And it’s also so gay. Gayer than brunch, probably.
Time and again, dining hall staff members have gone to bat for queer students and workers. In an old Crimson story, Adams House chef Ed Childs remembers the harassment endured by queer students before housing assignments were randomized in the late ‘90s. Adams became a target because it was known as the queer dorm. “[Anti-LGBTQ students] pissed into the dining hall through the windows,” Ed explains. “It was our workers that chased them away.” At one point, when anti-LGBTQ sentiment was especially high, Adams House dining hall workers wore shirts that said, “We’re All Gay.”
Dining hall workers also won one of America’s first sexual orientation non-discrimination provisions. “In the eighties,” Ed told me in an interview, “we said…this anti-discrimination clause has to be in the package, or we’re striking.” And, he added, HUDS workers are fighting for non-discrimination protections based on gender identity in this year’s round of negotiations.
But that’s not the only reason to say, “Yaaaaas, queen” to the HUDS strike. HUDS workers are fighting for affordable healthcare and a sustainable yearly income, and those issues are as queer as it gets.
Queer and trans people are disproportionately low-income because they are kicked out of their homes, denied jobs by discriminatory employers, and marginalized in schools. In a 2012 study, 29 percent of queer people reported experiencing a time “in the last [year] when they did not have enough money to feed themselves or their family.” Almost 20 percent of children living with female same-sex couples and 25 percent of children living with male same-sex couples are in poverty (that’s true for only 12 percent of children living with married different-sex couples). And transgender people are four times more likely to live in poverty than Americans at large.
Queer Americans are also more likely to be people of color than non-queer Americans, and they experience heightened economic marginalization at the intersection of racism, heterosexism, and cissexism. A third of black trans people and 28 percent of Latinx trans people make less than $10,000 in annual household income, and a full three quarters of queer Asians and Pacific Islanders have experienced discrimination at work. Queer young people, especially, are often forced into poverty because the harassment they face in their homes, schools, and workplaces makes it impossible to find stability or meaningful economic opportunity. Queer people are prevented from acquiring wealth on the basis of our queerness. That’s why economic justice—including HUDS workers’ right to a livable yearly income—is queer.
Access to healthcare is an especially queer issue. Right now, HUDS workers are on the defensive, fighting to keep their current healthcare plan. Harvard’s negotiating team has proposed sweeping cuts that would ratchet up co-pays so workers have to pay more out of pocket. HUDS workers are already some of the hardest-working and lowest-paid folks on campus. They can’t take a hit like that.
The proposed co-pay increases would devastate queer and trans workers in particular. When we make healthcare unaffordable, we keep queer and trans people from accessing gender-affirming treatments, like hormone therapy and gender-confirmation surgery. This is a queer issue, and the cuts proposed by Harvard are anti-LGBTQ.
Economic justice is inseparable from queer liberation, and that’s why supporting the strike—by joining the picket line near your House, bringing food to workers, and encouraging your friends to get involved, too—is very queer indeed. Let’s come out for economic justice.

A friend of mine once pointed out that when white people move to other countries, they’re considered expats, but when anyone else does it, they’re just immigrants. I remembered his words years later as my plane touched down in Beijing Capital International Airport. I would be there for the next two months, working at a nonprofit and practicing the language. My friend’s observation left me pondering a difficult question: As a Chinese American “coming home” to my motherland, what was I?
The first weekend made this question complicated. On Saturday night, all of the American college students flocked to the foreigner-dominated Sanlitun bar district. One favorite evening haunt, Elements Club, advertised the following deal: 100 RMB cover charge, but free if you were a “laowai” (foreigner).
Whether or not you were considered a “foreigner,” we quickly learned, depended less on the color of your passport and more on the color of your skin. The entire point of the laowai promotion was to attract more white people to the club. When I asked about the terms of the deal, the hostess at the front enthusiastically explained to me that I was, in fact, Chinese, since I “have a Chinese face"—I always have been, though the entirety of my life had been spent in America. Welcome home! Despite the fact that I had come back to China to reconnect with my heritage, I found, to my surprise, that I resented this.
The resentment showed through in small ways. I found myself relying on English more at restaurants and shops; taking care to dress the way I did back home; avoiding the local food; even exaggerating the imperfections of my spoken Chinese, and feigning ignorance of local customs. I did this, I realize now, in order to impress upon people that I was indeed American—not out of a sense of superiority, but rather one of insecurity. Because, as it happened, the hostess at Elements had stumbled upon a difficult question: Was I Chinese, American, or Chinese-American?
Perhaps the struggle of every person of Asian descent growing up in America lies in parsing the ambiguous terms of that hyphen. Is it to be understood in the same way as the hyphen connecting two surnames, indicating an unbreakable blood bond from two sources—mother-and-fatherland, so to speak? Growing up, the hyphen itself provoked a small sense of anxiety in me: That it symbolically connected the two countries made me wonder, quite strangely, whether my very soul was to be found in that ambiguous blot of ink or somewhere 30,000 feet over the Pacific, where my parents passed over in a plane when I was asleep and halfway between four and five. And finally, there was the disheartening order of the words, suggesting that I was somehow Chinese first and American second—the latter just a coincidence of geography, recent immigrant history dwarfed in significance by the ponderous certainty of my bloodline.
Standing next to my college friends in Sanlitun that night, I considered the possibility that it was all an act: That I had been Chinese all along, merely “passing” as American using an elaborate costume of language, fabric, and manners.
Oddly enough, what finally empowered me to let go of this internalized racist myth of the “perpetual foreigner” was observing my father, a man even less obviously “American” than I. Everybody knows that there are few pastimes more American than enjoying the outdoors: Thoreau’s immortal utterance on “living deliberately” is as etched into our collective consciousness as the pledge of allegiance. At the beginning of last summer, I accompanied my father on a series of hikes. First on the trails around our home in California; then to the Bay Area local favorite, Mission Peak; and finally, to the Grand Canyon, where my father and I, along with a group of 30 of his friends—all Chinese Americans—set out at dawn to hike from one rim to the opposite rim, and back.
I will never forget the scene from the campsite the night before: The classic American set-up of tents and portable cooking ware, only with a few modifications. We communicated with each other in an effortless Chinglish. The Tupperware on the picnic tables was filled with dumplings and steamed rice, not sandwiches. No one was wearing flannels, since my dad’s crowd—mostly engineers in Sillicon Valley—preferred the high-tech, ultra-light gear that comes out every year.
Here was the classic American pastime, executed flawlessly by a group of Chinese immigrants without a hint of awkwardness or imitation. “Happiness is not so complicated,” my dad said to me on the long drive back to California, as we passed through the vast expanse of Arizona. And he was right.
After this trip, I ditched the hyphen for good. I was no more Chinese-American than I was second-class. My father was no hyphenated American, and neither was I.

UPDATED: October 7, 2016, at 11:06 p.m.
Thursday’s negotiation session between Harvard and the union representing its dining workers did not yield a settlement on a new contract, but the two parties have scheduled another session for Friday.
Harvard University Dining Service workers will continue their historic strike over the holiday weekend, according to Tiffany Ten Eyck, a spokesperson for UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston union that represents HUDS.
Negotiators from Harvard and Local 26 have been in contract talks for nearly four months, debating over health care benefits and wages.  On Thursday, two outside mediators—Economics professor Lawrence F. Katz and Robert B. McKersie, professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management— joined the parties at the bargaining table to help facilitate the talks, according to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
Ten Eyck described the negotiations Thursday, the 20th bargaining session since talks began mid-June,  as a “positive conversation” in which the two parties provided relevant background information to the mediators.
HUDS workers began their strike Wednesday, picketing for the first time in more than 30 years, in the hopes of pressuring Harvard to comply with their wage and health benefits demands. The University has employed temporary workers and managers to staff dining halls across campus during the strike.
Ten Eyck said about 700 people picketed in and around Harvard Yard during the strike’s second day, including students, workers, and supporters from Boston.
The University has brought forth several health care proposals over the course of the past four months; Local 26 has rejected all of them. Harvard proposed the union enroll in an identical health plan to that Harvard negotiated with the University’s largest union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. That plan eliminated deducibles while it increased copayments. Additionally, the plan established a premium contribution tier for workers who make $55,000 or less.
On Monday, Harvard specifically attempted to address a union demand that HUDS workers be provided with the opportunity to work year round. Currently, dining service workers laid off during the University’s summer recesses and are unable to draw unemployment.  Additionally, the union has demanded that workers who make themselves available to work year-round be provided with a “minimum guaranteed salary” of $35,000, according to Ten Eyck.
According to deLuzuriaga, the average HUDS worker makes $34,000 annually,but the union has disputed that number, saying it their salaries are closer to $31,000 per year.
At a bargaining session on Monday, the University offered to pay HUDS workers who are available to work during the summer stipends in the amount of between $150 to $250, depending on the worker’s tenure at Harvard. These stipends would be provided on a weekly basis, “even if there are no open shifts” for workers, according to deLuzuriaga. Local 26 rejected that offer, though the union’s president, Brian Lang, called the proposal a “step in the right direction”
When asked what health care proposals the union has put on the table during the course of the negotiations, Local 26 leadership has declined to comment beyond indicating that they will not accept a proposal that causes their workers to shoulder additional out-of-pocket costs for health care. Local 26 has largely sought to maintain the contract HUDS had last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council distributed $200 worth of donuts and coffee Thursday to picketing Harvard University Dining Services workers.
The Council’s Executive Committee voted Thursday morning to allocate funds for the workers, who began a historic strike Wednesday as the University and UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based labor union which represents HUDS workers—failed to reach an agreement the night before. The vote follows the UC’s previous 45-3 decision Sunday to endorse the HUDS workers’ intent to strike. 
Members of the UC distributed the coffee and donuts at 1:30 p.m. Thursday in the Science Center Plaza. UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, who helped with distribution, called the event a “success.”
“We've endorsed the strike and we really want to make sure we put actions behind our endorsement,” said UC President Shabia Rather ’17, who also helped distribute the snacks to HUDS workers.
Typically, funding decisions by the Undergraduate Council must be approved by the body as a whole, but the Executive Committee has permission per the group’s constitution to spend up to $200 from the UC’s operations budget without a full vote. Since the full Council typically meets on Sundays, the provision helps the Executive Committee make time-sensitive funding allocations, according to Rather.
“They've spent so much time feeding us every day, the least we could do is return the favor,” Rather said. “Really this is a sign of appreciation more than anything else.”
Rather and Banks also met with University President Drew G. Faust on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing HUDS strike, their stance on the University’s sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and their concerns about financial need limiting students’ abilities to become leaders of campus groups. This was the last formal meeting between Faust, Rather, and Banks during their tenure leading the UC.
“We do want to make sure the administration knows that we are supporting the workers and that we are concerned about them.” Rather said.
Rather and Banks also presented to the Faculty Council last week on the sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social organizations—which starting with the Class of 2021 will bar members of such groups, including final clubs and Greek organizations, from holding leadership positions in student groups and receiving College-endorsed fellowships like the Rhodes and the Marshall. Rather and Banks had planned to share their thoughts to the Faculty Council “most likely in an op-ed" sometime this week; they have not yet publicly voiced their opinion on the policy.
“I think it's pretty clear that right now, Harvard is suffering from some division—whether that's between students who support and oppose the policy on single-gender organizations, whether that's between HUDS workers and the University,” Banks said, adding the meeting was about how to address such conflicts.
Further action by the UC to support HUDS may depend on the length of the strike.
“We are going to continue discussing,” Rather said. “But it all very much depends on how long the strike lasts. Negotiations are still continuing.”

Incoming Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. Narvekar oversaw negative 0.9 percent returns on Columbia University’s investments during his last fiscal year on the job, outpacing Harvard’s negative 2 percent over the same time period.
The returns bring Columbia’s 10-year endowment performance to an annualized 8.1 percent, exceeding Harvard’s annualized 5.7 percent returns over the past decade. Columbia’s endowment—at $9 billion, roughly a quarter the size of Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment—lost $600 million in value in fiscal year 2016. Narvekar, who will take the reins at Harvard’s investment arm in December, served as CEO of Columbia Investment Management Company during that time.

Harvard’s endowment decreased in value by nearly $2 billion in fiscal year 2016, a drop resulting from a combination of the negative returns and the $1.7 billion HMC paid out to fund the University’s annual operating budget. The “disappointing” endowment contraction will pressure Harvard’s budgets, University President Drew G. Faust said last month, adding that she was concerned by HMC’s lackluster investment performance compared to its peers.
Narvekar, who has overseen Columbia’s endowment since 2002, led the Columbia Investment Management Company to better returns than the HMC’s every year since the financial crisis. As HMC’s fourth CEO in 10 years, Narvekar will be tasked with evaluating and possibly restructuring the firm’s investment practices. In particular, he will arrive at HMC during a time when some University leaders, including Faust, wonder whether Harvard should retain outside funds to manage its money, emulating systems in place at many Ivy League endowments, including Columbia and Yale.
Harvard is so far next-to-last in the Ivy League for its fiscal year 2016 investment returns, beating only Cornell’s negative 3.3 percent returns. The University of Pennsylvania posted a 1.4 percent loss on its investments, Brown negative 1.1 percent returns, and Dartmouth negative 1.9 percent. Yale posted the only positive results in the conference—3.4 percent—and Princeton has not yet announced its returns.

Humanitarian aid experts debated how to provide medical care in Syria at a panel at the Kennedy School of Government Thursday afternoon.
The panel aimed to examine how aid workers—many of whom have not received formal training in conflict resolution—negotiate access to various resources, including water and medical supplies, for people living in war-torn countries.
The panel, titled "Humanitarian Negotiation Series: Protection of Medical Personnel and Operations at the Frontline," was moderated by Claude Bruderlein, a lecturer on global health at the School of Public Health. It featured Michael VanRooyen, director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, François Stamm, head of the delegation for the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Adrienne Fricke, a senior fellow at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.
“The survival of millions of people around the world depends on the capacity of individuals who would deny they’re actually negotiators, who actually never followed any training,” Bruderlein said. “This is the gap we’re trying to fill.”
VanRooyen noted the critical role that medical workers play in advocating for the rights of their patients.
“The role of a clinician, a physician, a surgeon, a nurse, an immunization worker on the front line is the most direct form of humanitarian negotiation that happens, and they work at it everyday,” he said.
According to Fricke, medical professionals in Syria are among the first aid workers not to be considered neutral parties in war, and are often intentionally attacked in battle.
“I think that one of the hallmarks of the conflict in Syria since 2011 has been the targeting of healthcare and health professionals and it may be that we’ve all heard it so frequently that it no longer resonates, but it is a big deal,” she said.
Ahmad Tarakji, president of the Syrian American Medical Society, attended the event and shared details of his experiences visiting Syrian hospitals during the war in an open discussion following the moderated panel.
Tarakji said he believed some humanitarian laws became ineffective in Syria because there were relatively few protests when human rights violations were first committed during the outbreak of the war.
“The challenge that we [faced was], as the community and society were being disintegrated in Syria, there were only smaller groups of people who stood up for the political and for the civil society,” he said.
Event attendee Jonas Brunschwig was struck by the severity of the situation in Syria.
“It’s a pretty doomed situation that needs some serious figuring out,” he said. “It sounds like there are some great people thinking about it but it’s not an easy nut to crack.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee hopes to combat high textbook costs this semester through several new student and faculty initiatives.
According to the Education Committee’s Chair, Scott Ely ’18, the committee plans to work with professors to reduce costs for courses that require expensive textbooks. They also hope to increase the supply of course materials available in libraries.
Committee Vice Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said the committee, in its first meeting of the academic year last week, discussed the recent introduction of mandatory $132 textbooks in Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” as a recent case in which expensive course materials have posed a financial burden to students.
Bonsall said that, although the committee is now addressing expensive textbooks by speaking with faculty members who teach courses with high costs, students also need more sustainable solutions to keep course materials affordable. To that end, they plan to start a student-run book exchange to provide easier access to used books.
Harvard students can currently use the Facebook group “Free & For Sale” or websites such as Amazon.com to buy used or cheaper versions of course materials, but affordable prices are not always guaranteed.
The problem of high textbook costs is not a new one. For the 2014-215 academic year, the average cost on a student for a year of books was estimated at $1,217, according to the Financial Aid office.
In addition to textbook costs, the education committee is also working on other initiatives this semester to improve students’ classroom experiences.
The committee hopes to begin a conversation about sexual assault and mental health in the classroom, according to Ely.
“Two other things we are working on is how do issues like sexual assault and mental health relate to the classroom,” Ely said. “Everything students are experiencing in their everyday lives is going to correlate to what goes on in the academic setting.”
Ely also said the Committee hopes to continue providing mentorship and resources for undergraduates who are first-generation or are from under-resourced high schools.

UPDATED: October 7, 2016, at 12:22 p.m.
Following the delay on discussion of a Faculty motion that could spell trouble for a new College policy, Harvard’s single-gender final clubs have settled into a familiar activity: playing the waiting game.
In the year before the announcement of an unprecedented policy, which will penalize members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations starting with the Class of 2021, Harvard’s 12 final clubs were constantly anticipating possible administrative action. Administrators had, for months, cajoled, urged, and ultimately threatened penalties if the clubs did not adopt gender neutral membership policies, while clubs guessed at possible outcomes.
In April, Fly Club graduate president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 lamented the duration and what he described as lack of specificity involved in proceedings with the administration.
“As we approach the end of a full year of conversation focused on that one topic, no details have emerged,” Porteus wrote in an email to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana ahead of an April meeting between club leaders and College administrators. 
Now, the clubs, along with other single-gender social organizations such as fraternities and sororities, are waiting for a Faculty vote on a motion that its proponents think could strike down the administration’s policy. That motion, proposed by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, stipulates that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
Many observers thought professors would vote on the motion at Tuesday’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, but a discussion on the topic was delayed because some professors observed Rosh Hashanah and the motion was designated as “substantive”—which means it must be discussed at one meeting before going to a vote. Now, Dec 6. Is the earliest professors would be able to vote on the motion.
During this waiting period, though, some clubs are occupying the interim by exploring their legal options. The all-male Fly Club, for instance, has retained the services of a legal team led by longtime Cambridge attorney Harvey A. Silverglate. In addition to the Fly, one other organization affected by the policy has retained legal services in anticipation of a possible legal fight, according to a leader of that group.
Silverglate said he was not particularly surprised by the delay, having noticed the conflict with Rosh Hashanah months before the Oct. 4 Faculty meeting. But, he said extra time can only be a good thing.
“There are some benefits to letting this cook a little bit, kind of percolate, and be the subject of more discussion,” Silverglate said. “The academic community is based on discussion, study, analysis meditation.”
The delay will also give Silverglate and his “fellow lawyers somewhat more time to complete the legal research.” Silverglate said he “does not think it likely” the Fly will file suit against the University before the Faculty votes on Lewis’s motion.
This fall, the final clubs are not waiting for certainty alone—Harvard’s sororities and fraternities also eagerly await a resolution to the faculty motion. The undergraduate and national leadership of Harvard’s Greek organizations were, for the better part of last year, unaware that they might be affected by any administrative sanctions.
Though Executive Director of the National Panhellenic Conference Dani Weatherford wrote in an emailed statement that the organization would “continue to press for the university to reconsider its policy,” the national umbrella group will take a back seat at least until faculty proceedings have played out.
“Ultimately… the future of this policy will be determined by the Harvard community. That makes the voices of students and the Harvard faculty crucially important in the weeks and months ahead,” Weatherford wrote.
Next week, students will be able to voice their opinions when a committee charged with implementing the sanctions will host a town hall to discuss its work.

UPDATED: October 7, 2016, at 12:28 p.m.
The Hutchins Center for African and African American Research received $10 million from the family foundation of prominent Harvard benefactor Glenn H. Hutchins ’77 for a new study of inequality experienced by African and African American residents in Boston’s poorest neighborhoods.
Hutchins helped found and endow the Hutchins Center in 2013 with a $15 million donation. The Center supports research on African and African American history and culture through sponsoring visiting fellows, art exhibitions, publications, conferences, and research projects. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., a University Professor in the Department of African and African American Studies, serves as the Center’s director.
Hutchins, co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake and former economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, also serves as co-chair of the University’s capital campaign and has made significant donations to the House renewal project.
Hutchins’s latest donation to the Center will support a new study on housing, labor, criminal justice, and child welfare in poverty stricken areas in Boston with the ultimate aim of influencing public policy. Hutchins said in an interview that he hopes the grant will allow the University and African and African American Studies scholars to continue “building an organization that could serve generations.”
University professor and sociologist William J. Wilson, who will lead the study, explained in an interview on CNBC Thursday that the study is innovative in its combination of empirical surveys, anthropological fieldwork and interviews, field experiments, and big data to look at race, economics, and “cumulative adversity.”
“By cumulative adversity, I mean people who have been exposed to multiple, different, and reinforcing hardships, racial hardships, and economic hardships,” he told CNBC. “We hope to analyze these problems simultaneously.”
Georgene Bess Montgomery, president of the National Council for Black Studies and associate professor at Clark Atlanta University, said the donation “speaks to the value of Black Studies.” She said she hopes the donation and the work of the Hutchins Center will set a precedent for other Black Studies centers and research projects across the country.
“People’s perceptions of Black Studies is wrong—many people perceive Black Studies as a feel-good course and something just for black people when Black Studies is way more than that,” she said. “Black Studies is a discipline in and of itself in the same way that English, history, math, biology are disciplines, and all of those have theory that are connected.”
Hutchins expressed similar sentiments, saying the presence of the Center helps make African and African American studies more “central” in academia.
“We’ve created the largest center in the world for African American, African, and now African Latino studies,” he said.
The donation comes at a time of increased dialogue on race both nationally and at Harvard, which has seen race-related activism including Black Lives Matter demonstrations within over the last several years on campus.
News of the donation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, came on the same day as the Center’s annual W. E. B. Du Bois Medal Ceremony, which honors people who have contributed to African history and culture and who more broadly advocate for cultural understanding and human rights.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven did not immediately confirm the gift by press time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Graduate School of Education Thursday Pulitzer-winning journalist Ron Suskind discussed his experience raising his son, who has autism, and the creation of an app to help children with autism communicate.
Suskind, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, chronicled his journey raising and connecting with his son, interspersing his narrative with clips from the movie "Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism," which is adapted from his eponymous book.
Suskind began the talk by describing his son, who was diagnosed with autism at age three. According to Suskind, his son had nearly no potential to speak and often could not make eye contact at that time. However, through watching Disney movies and by talking under the guise of Disney characters, Suskind was able to communicate and build a relationship with his son.
Since then, Suskind said he has realized the importance of using the unique interests and passions of children with autism to help them express their thoughts. Suskind and his wife came up with the idea of using an app to employ the power of animated movies as a means of communication. The app, called “Sidekicks App for Autism,” was developed by a team of neuroscientists and programmers.
Suskind described the app as a Siri-like platform in which parents can talk to their children through the voices of various animated characters from movies including “Toy Story," "Harry Potter," “Star Wars," and various Disney films.
Suskind argued that there are many ways parents and education can help children with autism develop their full potential. The key to achieving this, he said, is to help children find their passion.
“They’re square pegs in a world that prizes only round holes. If you shave off those edges, you’re shaving off their best parts,” he said.
Suskind also mentioned that parents of autistic children can be under considerable stress. He said as a result of this pressure, parents have difficulty embracing their children’s interests and passions.
Meghan Hughes, a GSE student who attended the event, said she appreciated the forum.
“I think it was really powerful and insightful. Especially coming from a background where I know people with autism, I thought he articulated his story in a beautiful and relatable way," Hughes said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time a Cornell football team started a season 3-0, Barack Obama had yet to be elected president. Instagram hadn’t launched, Michael Jackson was still alive, and LeBron James was a Cleveland Cavalier (he left for South Beach in 2010.) And the school’s last undefeated start prior to its 2008 campaign? 1999. The last time the Harvard football team did not start a season 3-0 was in 2011. So for the first time this millennium, Harvard and Cornell square off this weekend in a battle of the unbeatens.
“This team comes in with a lot of momentum,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They’re a very good team…. I think they’ll be...one of the top three teams we’ll play all year. What’s going to make them particularly challenging is [that] they believe.”
The preseason pick for Ivy League champion has played as well as expected to start the season. So far, the Crimson has averaged nearly 500 yards of offense a game. With the addition of a mobile quarterback in senior Joe Viviano, the Crimson is averaging 203.3 yards on the ground to go along with the Viviano-led passing attack that averages nearly 294.3 yards a game.
Senior halfback Anthony Firkser.  has led the offense. Last week against Georgetown, Firkser had five catches for 147 yards and two touchdowns including a 75-yard pitch and catch from Viviano in the second quarter.
His season totals nearly match his 2015 production—he only needs 36 yards to surpass his 2015 total. Currently, the senior has 336 yards and four touchdowns.
“I think he’s as good a football player as any of the kids that we’ve had,” Murphy said. “He doesn’t have the length of a Cam Brate, he probably doesn’t have the strength or explosiveness of a Kyle Juszczyk, but he’s every bit as good of a football player as any of those guys.”
Firkser’s play has been complemented by the rushing attack of Viviano and junior running back Semar Smith. To go along with Viviano’s 127 rush yards and two touchdowns, Smith is averaging 89.3 yards per game.
“I think we’re doing well,” Firkser said. “There’s definitely some places we can improve…. I think we’re making some big plays, but I don’t think we’re as consistent as we can be.”
While the high-powered Harvard offense looks to continue to average 38 points per game, Cornell’s defense will be a stiffer test than the Georgetown defense the Crimson faced last Friday.
Although two of Cornell’s three wins have been by eight points or fewer, the Big Red defense limited Yale to just 13 points two weekends ago. Following a shootout win against Colgate, Cornell is allowing 22.3 points per game. However, the points per game statistic isn’t particularly indicative of the defense’s play. The defense has allowed nearly 160 rushing yards per game and has conceded five rushing scores. The pass defense has been more reliable, only allowing 276 yards per game and three touchdowns. Regardless, the defense as a whole is surrendering an average of 435.7 yards per game.
Last week against Colgate, the Big Red scratched back from a 19-point deficit in the third quarter to take down the Raiders. Colgate led by as many as 23 points in the contest, rocketing to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter.
However, Cornell mounted a huge comeback, winning 39-38 on a 19-yard pass with 28 seconds left in the game. It’s interesting to note that Cornell has been outscored by 14 points in the first quarter this season while outscoring opponents in every other period.
Offensively, the Big Red is third in the Ivy League in points per game to go along with 433.7 yards per contest. The rushing game has been reliable, with 475 yards and four touchdowns over three games, but the passing game is the focal point of Cornell’s offense.
Quarterback Dalton Banks is averaging 306.7 yards a game to go along with seven touchdowns. Clearly, Banks likes to spread the ball as no receiver has more than 180 yards for the season and only senior wideout Collin Shaw has more than one touchdown.
“They’ve got a couple good running backs, their left tackle is pretty good,” said senior defensive lineman Miles McCollum. “Their quarterback has been doing really well... so we’ve really got to shut that down.”
The Harvard defense has been stingy this year, though. Twenty points per game stingy. Five interceptions and three fumble recoveries in three games stingy. So the Cornell offense will have its hands full this weekend against the Crimson D.
“Cornell’s one of the best teams I think we’re going to face this year,” said McCollum. “First and foremost we want to stop the run, that’s what we’ve been focusing on, that’s what Harvard football does.”
The defensive line has been integral in Harvard’s success this season. Led by seniors McCollum, Doug Webb, and James Duberg along with sophomore DJ Bailey, the Crimson defensive line has helped limit opponents to fewer than 100 yards per game on the ground and the unit has combined for six sacks. Of those six, Bailey has three and a half.
“We’ve been really happy with the d-line’s production,” McCollum said. “We’ve got a veteran group [and] DJ Bailey had a great game last week.”

­With the second half of the season well underway, and an Ivy League title still up for grabs, it’s go time for the Harvard men’s soccer team (4-3-2, 0-0-1 Ivy League).
After a particularly difficult stretch, including games against Pac-12 teams and a gritty Ivy League opener against Yale last weekend, the Crimson will be looking to get back into the win column on Saturday when Cornell (0-8-2, 0-1-0) comes to town for the final game of a three-game home stretch for Harvard.
“We were happy with the way we performed in the second half last week,” senior striker Jake Freeman said. “At the same time we thought we came out very slow, so it wasn’t exactly the result we wanted. We understand we’re still in a great spot as a team, and we’ve taken this week to just prepare and improve on the things we needed to, to get ready for Saturday.”
Both teams will be entering Saturday’s match coming off of tight matches, with the Crimson registering a tie to push its unbeaten streak to three games.
Meanwhile, the Big Red fell to Penn last Saturday to extend its losing streak to five games. Not only will both teams be looking for their first Ivy League wins, they will also look to do so in regular time.
Cornell has played five games into overtime so far while Harvard has seen two go into double-overtime and a handful of others decided in the final minutes. Saturday will provide both teams with another opportunity to decide the game in 90 minutes.
“We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing, and make little adjustments,” senior central defender Daniel Smith said. “There’s just a couple little things that we needed to clean up and we’ll be fine.”
Harvard will see familiar faces on Cornell’s senior-heavy team, as several of the team’s playmakers returned from last year, including Brady Dickens, George Pedlow, and Madison Heck. With so many key players to track, it would appear to be a difficult task to make sure each player is shut down—but not for Harvard.
“We’ll go through a team scout of what Cornell does and what makes them a decent team,” Freeman said. “We really want to focus on ourselves, and think about what we can do as a team to put us in the best position to win the game, whether that’s defending as a team… or keeping our composure in the offensive third. We know if we take care of our own business, the rest of it will take care of itself.”
Staying true to form, Harvard will stick to shutting down the Cornell team in all facets, instead of focusing on a few players. This strategy is imperative against the Big Red—six different players have accounted for the team’s eight goals.
In its last game, Cornell posted a season-high 20 shots.
To offset Cornell’s offense, the Crimson will be relying on both its offense and defense. The back line has thus far been effective in breaking up opponents’ plays, and goalkeeper Kyle Parks has accrued a 1.69 goals-against average after 41 saves in the past nine games. The junior has also two shutouts on the season.
Offensively, Harvard will defer to its own group of leaders—co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, Freeman, juniors Christian Sady and Justin Crichlow, and two-time Ivy League Rookie of the Week Matthew Glass. Freeman and Glass currently lead the Crimson in points, with 11 and 10, respectively, which also puts them in the second and third places of the Ivy League scoring standings.
Currently, Harvard leads the all-time series against Cornell, 40-22-15, and has not lost a game against the Big Red since 2012.
The Crimson will do everything it can to preserve that win streak and continue to gain momentum for the balance of the season.
“We are not focusing on the win or the record, or how the league is shaping up,” Smith said. “We just want to focus on how we’re playing, and doing everything that we can do. If we focus on us, and we execute to the best of our ability, then things will shape out for us.”

It seems like we're going to be gearing up for Harry Potter releases for the rest of our lives—not that we're complaining! November 18th marks the release date of the new Harry Potter spinoff movie, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" and we couldn't be more excited. The trailers look awesome, and the reviews for the movie are already saying its going to be a great movie, albeit more "grownup" than its predecessors.
If you are anything like us, you definitely want to get into the Harry-Potter spirit. Here are some ways you can:
Start dressing upHalloween way be over, but it's never too late to throw on a costume.You can get premade Harry Potter robes on Amazon starting from $20. If you don't want to wait or searching for “Harry Potter costume for adults” is too embarrassing, you can always throw a blanket over your shoulders and pretend it's the Invisibility Cloak. It'll keep you warm and maybe even hide you from stares as you slowly fall asleep in Lamont.
Search for fantastic beasts on campusAlthough we're a little short on owls and hippogriffs, Harvard has it’s share of fantastic beasts.
If you're lucky, you’re in an entryway with pets. If not, you can still sometimes catch a glimpse of proctors walking their dogs through the Yard. Or you can cuddle with bunnies, ducklings and piglets at Pet Therapy, hosted by Harvard Common Spaces every other Friday at noon in the Science Center Plaza. If you want to spot a more exotic breed, try to track down the Harvard Turkey and its quickly-growing family. You'll be a regular Newt Scamander in no time. And if you’re more into the creepier crawlier creatures of Harry Potter, well, you can always pretend the next roach you catch is actually Rita Skeeter.
Assign magical names to each of your classesDoes it make it better if you think of your math pset as Arithmancy homework? Or, as all of the indecipherable symbols start to blur together, Runes?
Eat in AnnenbergObligatory reference, because we all know Annenberg is the Great Hall. Even if you're an upperclassman, Annenberg is open to you for breakfast. There's no butterbeer or pumpkin juice, but there's a plentiful stock of the staple of any college student’s life: Coffee. Of course, the food probably won't be Hogwarts quality, but at least the architecture's on point.
Face down a DementorWho needs Dementors when you’re facing down concentration declaration deadlines in a few days? If only we could Expecto Patronum those away.
