After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m no stranger to folks paying tribute to Jane Austen. Long before I read “Emma,” I could quote “Clueless.” Last December, I half-heartedly chewed my way through a “Pride and Prejudice”- inspired mystery entitled “Death Comes to Pemberley.” When I was 13, “The Jane Austen Book Club” taught me to think of “Persuasion” as “the one with the dead mom,” so this was the first thing that popped into my mind when I learned Austen’s last completed novel had inspired Louisa Hall ’04’s “The Carriage House.” My next move was to brace myself for 279 pages of old dogs forced into new outfits, but “The Carriage House” is refreshingly devoid of the stale prose and tedium that tend to undercut books based on books. Through superb character development, narrative innovations that are all her own, and humor that winks at Austen without kowtowing to her, new author Hall crafts a poignant tale that transcends the riff-off genre.
The novel’s nucleus is the Adair family. The Adairs were once the toast of Breacon, Pa.,: attractive, athletic, and prepossessing. But in the novel’s opening chapter, patriarch William is sidelined by a stroke and wakes to an upsetting realization: his three daughters are all disappointments. Hall writes, “they had done nothing but practice the art of slow drowning.” Elizabeth is a failed actress, driven home by a divorce. Diana is a struggling architecture student whose looks have faded along with her tennis game. Isabelle is a sulky, ambition-free teenager. Hall’s gang of malcontents is rounded out by Adelia, William’s childhood love who has spent the last 10 years trying to burrow her way back into his life, and Louise, the flighty Australian caretaker who looks after William’s Alzheimer’s-stricken wife, Margaux. This cast congregates in the family home on Little Lane, and in a bid to revive William’s spirits, dedicate themselves to the task of saving the eponymous carriage house—a type of outbuilding used to use house horse carriages and a decrepit Adair family heirloom that the neighborhood council has slated for destruction.
Suburban intrigue ensues, but Hall’s sticking point is undoubtedly her characters. Austen’s novels typically contain just a handful of sympathetic persons. The troop of pedants, morons, and petty relations who ring them are meant to elicit laughs, not pathos. With “The Carriage House,” Hall breathes life into a tomb’s worth of minor characters that in the original are resolutely—albeit deliberately, and brilliantly—one-dimensional. The reason it is possible to enjoy “The Carriage House” without having read “Persuasion” is because Hall’s inventions are not mere iterations of Austen’s characters: they are dynamic enough to stand or flail or collapse in a heap on their own. Hall does not give her main characters short shrift either. Diana, like the heroine of “Persuasion,” undergoes a restorative transformation, but gradual tonal shifts make clear that this rebirth is mental as well as physical. Also superbly drawn is Adelia, whose unmotherly nature pervades every aspect of her bearing even as she yearns to transfigure herself into wife and parent.
Hall’s crowning achievement is her reimagining of the mother in “Persuasion.” In Austen’s novel, the matriarch is dead. Margaux is merely mentally absent, but the specter of her effaced consciousness is as haunting as any ghost. By way of old diary entries, unearthed by nosy Louise, Hall creates a character that is strikingly original and genuinely horrifying: a woman who foresaw her disease and was content to fade away. Her diary entries are imbued with spine-tingling indifference: “Already I feel myself slipping away, and here is a secret I’d like to remember: in truth it’s not too bad. I’m scared, but only in the way you are before you dive beneath a wave. Once you’ve dived, there’s nothing but cool darkness and the tumbling into something that was part of you before you were born.” Intoxicating in and of herself, Margaux also compels those tortured by her empty presence to reveal their humanity. Isabelle initially comes across as not quite believable, but a harrowing, almost completely one-sided conversation she has with her mother late in the novel works wonders. One emerges not only convinced of Isabelle’s dynamism, but also sympathetic for a character easily as dismissible as facile.
Hall’s use of controlling motifs also bolsters a nuanced quality, which further develops “The Carriage House.” If the Adairs have one thing in common, it is tennis: William harbors an ardent—some would say unhealthy—love for the game, and each of his daughters competed in their youth. Hall’s choice is spot on. Tennis is all about recovery, and the characters of “The Carriage House” spend the novel trying to claw their way back to a place where they feel in control. The motif also fosters a sense of combativeness between these characters, who engage in verbal rallies, fighting tooth and nail for figurative points. Hall’s handling of the carriage house itself is equally deft. At the beginning of the novel, its decrepitude mirrors that of the Adairs. It looms in the backyard, throwing their decay in their faces. As the Adairs change, so too does the carriage house. It’s the rare visual motif that also acts as a plot device, both impelling and holding a mirror to the Adairs’ transformation.
Hall is careful to temper the sadness that pervades “The Carriage House” with healthy doses of comedic vitriol. It is in her treatment of suburbia that Hall’s tone comes closest to paralleling Austen’s. Her accounts of housewives’ activities and country club politics are merciless. Little Lane golden girl Abby Weld is introduced as follows: “She was not a happy girl, and furthermore she had a weak backhand and Diana would clobber her.” One-liners in this vein are rife and help prevent “The Carriage House” becoming too heavy for its own good.
I read “Persuasion” just over a year ago, on a bus wending its way from New York to Chicago, but if the jacket flap had not alerted me, I think I may have made it to the end of “The Carriage House” without having deduced its derivative status. Most adaptations ask, what if this story occurred in modern times? “The Carriage House” adds, and what if things were a whole lot more complicated? By daring to transfigure Austen utterly, Hall succeeds in fashioning a text that is at once highly unique and a credit to its forerunner.

I’ll admit it; I used to judge books by their covers. It was a routine I picked up after having voraciously perused the stacks of the school library every afternoon for something worthwhile to read. After two summers, I had decimated the youth section of the public library of their entire young adult romance selection, as any prepubescent girl would. I was an impatient reader; I could identify from the first few paragraphs of a novel if the rest of the plot was going to be worth my time. My habit eventually developed into something so obstructive that it started to prevent me from actually reading the book without first scrutinizing its outside cover. If the front of the book were too cluttered with different fonts and colors, I wouldn’t even touch it. Since the covers of virtually every young romance novel cover in the early 2000s featured identical shocking pink bubble letters and cartoon images of skinny girls wearing high heels, I found myself in a drought of substantive reading material until I noticed a bright white book with an upside-down baby chick on its cover in a Scholastic Book Fair catalog. Since the cover was so minimalistic and straightforward, I had to sneak a peek inside—and ended up finishing “Flipped” in one sitting. Can you even imagine what my life would have been like had I not decided to open the book? It was no surprise that I quickly saw through my naiveté after—for lack of a better pun—I had flipped.
Wendelin Van Draanen’s he-said/she-said account of a puppy love that almost runs its course remains to this date a book that I will forever cite as something that has irrevocably changed my perspective on life. As grandiose and tacky as that statement sounds, it’s appropriate as a description for “Flipped,” a novel so innocent that it still retains popularity on recommended reading lists for elementary schools. Buoyed by a film adaptation released three years ago, “Flipped”  has continued to stand out among the many other subpar and derivative young adult books that I previously had to endure.
And perhaps I’m just being a tad dramatic; after all, I’m saying that my favorite book is a novel geared towards middle-schoolers. However, even though Julianna Baker and Bryce Loski are only seven when they first meet, the retelling of every significant scene in the novel from both characters’ viewpoints makes their romance one of the most authentic accounts of young love I have ever read. The narrative starts with Juli’s one-sided infatuation with her crush, the blue-eyed Bryce, who cares more about his reputation than others’ feelings. As the intrepid Juli continues to make increasingly bold advances toward the extremely self-conscious Bryce, the harsh realities of the outside world begin to reverse their unique relationship over time. After a series of bad judgment calls and awkward encounters, Juli begins to lose interest just as Bryce finally notices that Juli may not be as intimidating and bothersome as he’d always perceived her to be. The pages of my copy of “Flipped” are just about to fall out due to excessive use; in my multiple rereadings of the novel, I could never quite identify at what exact moment in the plot at which Bryce finally realized that he was falling for Juli. But now that I’m looking back, I guess that was the whole point. How are you supposed to know exactly when your feelings for someone change?
Admittedly, like all tween novels, “Flipped” has its fair share of quotable one-liners that are universal enough to youth to be found on countless Tumblrs of wistful and overly emotional teenagers; these are quotes that join the ranks of the ultimate cliché: Stephen Chbosky’s “And in this moment, I swear we were infinite.” However, the metaphor Bryce’s grandfather uses to lecture Bryce about making uninformed preconceptions about people is a particularly memorable one because it made me realize my own faults as well: “Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss...but every once in a while, you find someone who’s iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.” I remember reading that line for the first time and feeling goosebumps erupt all over my skin. That was when I knew this book was different.
But the most surprising element of the book was that “Flipped” surpasses the typical formula of young adult romances by taking exemplary care in how it illuminates various social stigmas. “Flipped” was the first book to have introduced me to mental illness and its effect on relationships, something not covered in my customary regimen of “Lizzie McGuire” episodes. Never before had I considered ignoring first impressions until I had read “Flipped.” You know you’ve found a book that’s powerful when it makes you reverse your entire perception of the world. And when you do, you are not beholden to a black/white judgment of a cover, but instead you can gain an iridescent spectrum and nothing will ever compare.

“Maybe someday I’ll relax a bit,” says jazz musician Joshua Redman ’91. Development, not relaxation, has long been his specialty. Since his meteoric rise to fame after graduating from Harvard, catapulted by a win at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition, his tenor sax has been one of the most influential voices in contemporary jazz. Yet fame has not dulled Redman’s creative energy. He has been releasing new albums consistently, exploring new interests, new compositions, and new sounds. Relax? For this artist, it’s unlikely.
The Harvard Crimson: You’re performing in the upcoming Harvard Jazz Bands concert to honor former Director of Harvard Bands Tom G. Everett. How do you think your time with Tom and the Harvard Jazz Bands influenced your playing and your career?
Joshua Redman: The Jazz Band was really the only thing I was doing to keep playing while I was at Harvard. What was nice is that due to Tom’s energy and devotion, it was actually a very good band with a lot of great players. In fact, I didn’t even make it the first time I tried out. When I came to Harvard, I didn’t really have it in mind that I wanted to be a musician. I knew that I wanted to keep playing jazz, and the Jazz Band gave me the opportunity to play every week.
THC: It wasn’t until you moved to New York and started regularly doing gigs that you really hit your stride in what has become an extremely successful career as a professional jazz musician. Do you have any advice about navigating the New York music scene for Harvard musicians who might have similar ambitions?
JR: I don’t really feel comfortable giving advice, since it’s a much different scene than when I was working there 20 years ago. What I can say is this: you can’t go into jazz wanting to make a solid living or wanting to become well known. Those are just not the reasons that attract people to this music. The people who come to be the most artistically successful and who come to feel the most fulfilled with their work are those with a genuine passion and dedication to this music. Those who start playing professionally based on a desire to preserve and further this music are bound to find their niche somewhere along the line.
THC: You have a new release, “Walking Shadows,” coming out this May, which is a record with an orchestral component. What interests you in this particular setting for your music?
JR: This new record is a ballads record. About half the tracks have a small orchestra on them, but it’s more specifically a ballads record. That’s the project that I’ve been interested in doing for a while, but I haven’t felt strong enough as a musician to go through with it. The most challenging aspect of performing ballads is how vulnerable you are from an emotional standpoint. You’re really out there and exposed in terms of the emotional content of your expression—ballads require you to really dig deep emotionally and spiritually. So, it took me a lot of practice and experience to reach the technical level where I felt comfortable releasing a record that consists solely of ballads.
THC: What does the title mean?
JR: I liked that it communicated slow motion. I also liked the mysterious quality that it conveyed, the quality of light and dark, which I think fits this music very well. It’s from the famous Macbeth line, “Life’s but a walking shadow,” although that has an extremely cynical or nihilistic quality to it, which is not really what I wanted to communicate. So in a way, I’m using it somewhat ironically, since this record is really a celebration of life, just like all music is to some extent. I think this dual quality is central to jazz, especially: it’s both a celebration of life, but a simultaneous recognition of its opposite, of mortality and the shortness of life. I think it was this duality that I particularly wanted to convey in this title.
THC: With each new project you constantly seem to be pushing your music in new directions. What do you do to maintain this inventiveness and sense of forward motion, particularly in a jazz scene that seems ever more difficult to track as a whole?
JR: That’s an excellent question. I think ultimately it comes down to my artistic temperament. I feel like I’m an artist who always likes to keep moving, who always finds a place to improve and expand my playing. Each thing I learn brings 10 or 15 things that I still need to learn. Although, I don’t want to give the impression that my experience of my music is only negative. I think in the actual moment of making music, it’s always a very positive experience, but the process of reflecting on my music is more negative and critical, which I think is part of what keeps me moving like this. Of course, there are plenty of examples of great jazz musicians who found a resting place and stayed there. They spent their careers developing a particular voice and are great and memorable because they stuck with that voice. I just feel like I tend to see room for growth in my playing, so it’s hard for me to settle down somewhere musically. Maybe someday I’ll relax a little bit [laughs].
THC: So what’s your next step after the ballads record?
JR: I’ve got several other groups and projects that I’m working with. I’ll be touring with a quartet soon along with a fellow Harvard alum, Aaron Goldberg [’96]. We’ll be playing some of the tracks off the new record, as well as some other music that I’ve written recently. As for where I’m headed next, I’m not too sure. We’ll just have to see.

As one listens to Iron & Wine’s fifth studio album, “Ghost on Ghost,” it becomes clearer and clearer that the somber title is more sadly prophetic than anything else, as Sam Beam slowly and resolutely buries himself alive underneath the choking weight of his 11-piece band. Beam, a prolific lyricist known for his earnest and poetic verses, seems to have worked against his own grain on this newest album, building a muddy and crowded record that, ironically enough, often feels empty for all its extraneous stuffing. Tangled instrumentals aside, however, it is the album’s lack of Beam’s classically piercing lyrics that eventually leads the work to collapse under its own excessive weight.
 
Beam’s first two albums, “The Creek Drank the Cradle,” and “Our Endless Numbered Days”—which were released in 2002 and 2004 respectively—are startlingly simplistic. The tracks are full of cleanly intricate and hushed guitar lines that serves as lovely, moving skeletons for the flesh of the songs—Beam’s transcendent lyrics, which he delivers in a low voice that ranges all the way from a whisper to a murmur. Beam’s poeticism on these albums is the stuff of wonder, capturing raw, complex emotion in the space of a few lines. On these early albums, the occasionally over-pronounced strum of acoustic guitar was considered musical texture.
 
However exceptional Beam’s early work, it is still wildly unfair to lament “Ghost on Ghost” merely on the basis that it is not a plain reiteration of “Days” or “Cradle.” That’s fine, but “Ghost” has a host of problems and missteps that mark it as a mediocre album in its own right—its relation to Beam’s previous heart-rending albums only makes its flaws glare that much more brightly.
 
The album opens with a note of defiance—a few moments of clacking percussive beats which stumble over a bed of discordant feedback—as Beam seems to suggest that he could stray much farther from his simple crooner roots than he does on the ensuing track, which is held together by a self-consciously twanging guitar melody often punctuated by the interrupting blat of horns and shimmer of tambourine.
 
The complex instrumentals on this track feel like an evolution of Iron & Wine’s 2011 album “Kiss Each Other Clean,” for which Beam incorporated many new instruments in the attempt to create a new sound, one which, as he told Spin was meant to evoke “that early-to-mid-’70s FM, radio-friendly music.” However, on “Ghost on Ghost,” the band has gone beyond adding interesting and “friendly” texture. Instead, the overlapping instrumentals bring to mind an informal and often-confused orchestra of [horns, strings, and a tambourine whose many tight, high notes seem designed to distract.
 
Against all reason, Beam and his 11-piece band stay true to this newfound and problematic musical formula of “more is more” throughout the album, with the noise culminating in the bulging track “Lover’s Revolution.” The song opens with a jazzy horn pushing Beam’s quiet opening lyrics forward as he delicately enunciates, “I came to you, and you to me.” As the track continues, some raucous and unnecessary neighbors join the horn—first among them a shuddering percussive beat and a ragged group chorus that repeats Beam’s opening lines in muted yelps. A stumbling keyboard line makes its presence known, and in its wake comes a deep, staggering drum line and another chorus of high-pitched, ephemeral vowel sounds. On top of this mess he’s made, Beam sings with unusual force, giving each verse a kind of biting power. However, it is never clear whether this is an aesthetic choice or a necessity given the overpowering background noise.
 
Troubling musical experimentation aside, the true disappointment of this album is the flatness of Beam’s lyrics. On the inappropriately titled “Joy,” Beam hits a career first as he spins out some lyrics that are at once immature and unnervingly creepy: “Deep inside the heart of this troubled man / Lives and itty-bitty boy tugging hard at your hand.” He goes on to try to justify this with the almost-acceptable line “born bitter as a lemon, but you must understand, that you’ve been bringing me joy,” but the damage is already done, and he soon falls on clichés to save him—“I’m only frightened ’cause you finally gave me something to lose.” These lyrics echo and repeat themselves in a muted chorus behind Beam’s sugared voice, begging the question of why he thought that such banal sentiments would bear being reiterated. In contrast, the complex, dark-tinged sentiments that Beam wove in “Upward Over the Mountain,” back in 2002, would confound the simplistic narrative voice that has sway over this album.
 
Though complaints against a band changing its style often read as bitter, “Ghost on Ghost” is not merely underwhelming in relation to Beam’s previous releases. It is a disappointing album unto itself—complicated without depth, self-absorbed without reason to be.  Sam Beam, who has long been the patron saint of earnest mumbles, has abandoned his simplicity along with his sincerity in the name of grandiose experimentation. Unfortunately, on “Ghost on Ghost,” his bet has not paid off.

Mira Nair ’79 is a director with a distinctive subject: the interaction of South Asians with the West. Her films “Mississippi Masala” and “The Namesake” explore the lives of immigrants in the United States, while her most acclaimed film, “Monsoon Wedding,” depicts the impact of Westernization and capitalism on contemporary Indian society. On Wednesday, Nair came to Harvard to discuss her latest feature film, “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” which is scheduled for release on April 26.
“Fundamentalist” is her latest meditation on East-West relations, but it differs from its predecessors in two crucial aspects: it is Nair’s most explicitly political film, and it examines the story of an immigrant not from her home country, India, but from Pakistan. On Wednesday, Nair discussed the film with Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, at the center’s Hauser Forum held in the Brattle Theatre. She spoke before an audience that included University President Drew G. Faust and forum financier Rita Hauser herself.
Nair’s father was born in pre-partition Lahore, which—along with New York— is one one of the cities where “The Reluctant Fundamentalist” is set. Nair said she wanted to challenge the prevailing American narrative about Pakistan after 9/11 and to encourage dialogue between the two countries. These concerns are evident in the film, which critiques the American foreign policy toward Pakistan and emphasizes the diversity of its culture.
“The Reluctant Fundamentalist” is adapted from the novel of the same name by Mohsin Hamid, who co-wrote the screenplay with William Wheeler. Initially, Nair attempted to hire an “A-list Hollywood screenwriter,” she said, but every screenwriter she solicited insisted that the film’s title be changed. Hamid was both a lover of film and an unusually accommodating author, Nair said. “He understood straight away that film is a different medium.”
Despite the consistency in the title, the content of the film was substantially changed, Nair said. Even by the standards of Hollywood adaptations, this film differs markedly from its source novel in both plot and tone. Unusually, it does so not by omitting material, but by adding it. The film adds a framing device in which the film’s protagonist, Changez Khan, played by the British-Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed, is interrogated by a CIA operative in connection with the kidnapping of an American professor. Nair explained this addition as an attempt to reflect topical questions in Pakistan, most notably the case of Raymond Davis, a private contractor for the CIA who allegedly killed two men in Pakistan.
Nair’s earlier films have focused on the personal stories of seemingly ordinary individuals and families. “The Reluctant Fundamentalist” is a conscious departure from this pattern, but Bhabha and Nair noted that that it shares many of the features of her previous work, including the use of layered, complex shots, and a musical score so central to the pacing and mood that it is like a character in the film. “I love nach-gan-tamasha [dance, song, and spectacle],” Nair said. At one point during the filming, Nair’s husband, Columbia University professor Mahmood Mamdani, asked her if she was making “Monsoon Terrorist,” referring to the artistic similarity between “Fundamentalist” and Nair’s earlier “Monsoon Wedding.”
“This is the most difficult film I have ever made,” Nair said, referring to the logistical challenges that impeded its production. She has always worked on relatively small budgets but found financing especially challenging for this film given its controversial subject matter, she said. Yet Nair was able to assemble a cast that includes established Hollywood stars Kate Hudson, Liev Schreiber and Kiefer Sutherland and Bollywood veterans Om Puri and Shabana Azmi. Financing was finally secured from the Doha Film Institute and its founder, the daughter of the emir of Qatar. The film’s long journey from production to release is a reflection of the difficulty of marketing a film with this title and subject.
Nair remains defiantly optimistic about the film’s prospects. Asked by Hauser who her intended audience is, she described “The Reluctant Fundamentalist” as her most global film yet. It will be released widely in the U.S., Europe, and Pakistan, and on 650 screens in India. Audiences familiar with Nair’s oeuvre are likely to be surprised by its solemnity and by its emphasis on the political rather than the personal. But 25 years after the release of “Salaam Bombay,” her enthusiasm for filmmaking is undimmed, and “The Reluctant Fundamentalist” indelibly bears the imprint of its director.

Ending a four-year hiatus, Fall Out Boy have come screaming out of obscurity with a new album, the humbly titled “Save Rock And Roll.” Despite a comical band name and an even more comical album name, Fall Out Boy is a complex band. They began as a clean, simple expression of the new millennium’s taste for pop-punk and have ceaselessly reinvented themselves with each new album since their seminal debut, “Take This To Your Grave.” Each successive album would entail new tricks and gimmicks, slowly drawing the band further from its pop-punk roots and deeper into the realm of pop as Fall Out Boy fearlessly pushed the limits of their genre. Their latest release brings their delusions of grandeur to a zenith, but it’s a hell of a ride nonetheless.
 
“Grave” served as an unadorned schematic of all of the band’s lasting characteristics, from the full-sentence song titles to the slippery wordplay of bassist and lyricist Pete Wentz.  These stood against the simple, unassuming power chords that only pop punk can deliver. To a casual listener of Fall Out Boy, “Save Rock And Roll” sounds miles away from the band’s first effort. And in many respects, this is true. “Grave” was an earnest expression, all screams and muddy distortion, while “Rock And Roll” proudly presents itself as a grand spectacle, wreathed in pristine production and melodrama. But wrapped carefully in all the strings and big-studio sheen, there still lies the heart of these princes of pop-punk.
 
Subtlety has never been a strong suit of Fall Out Boy’s, but to accuse them of insincerity would be a mistake. An immediate salvo of strings on the opening track of the album removes any doubt as to the depth of Fall Out Boy’s conviction that they are indeed the saviors of rock and roll. Patrick Stump growls, “Put on your warpaint,” and the drums begin to pound as Fall Out Boy makes their case for savior status. Appropriately titled, “The Phoenix” is the beginning of a triumphant return, with Stump shouting, “I’m going to change you like a remix / Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix” as a battle cry and a promise.
 
Unfortunately, the album cannot maintain the momentum built in the opening track. The second track, “My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up),” provides three minutes of interesting ideas, but never really feels like a coherent song of its own—although it provides the most rock-and-roll moment of the album with Stump’s hair-metal scream of “I’m on fiyahhhhh.” Tracks like “Where Did The Party Go” sound like archetypal Fall Out Boy songs with an added veneer of overproduction and tinsel. The classically affecting lyrics like “My old aches become new again, / My old friends become exes again” are undercut somewhat by the persistent synths rattling away in the background.
 
“The Mighty Fall” is at least unambiguously a departure from Fall Out Boy’s modus operandi, opening with a droll introduction from Big Sean and ending with a similarly droll verse from the rapper that feels so out of place that it seems like a puzzling way of making sure the listener is awake. A similarly strange set of guest vocals is provided by Courtney Love, who sounds surprisingly good for a short verse toward the end of “Rat A Tat,” but still profoundly out of place. Big Sean is too hip-hop for Fall Out Boy,while Love is too punk. The use of these two featured artists feels more like showmanship rather than genuine artistry.
 
While the album lags when it attempts to straddle the realms of the grandiose and the earnest, it soars when it fully embraces one or the other. “Miss Missing You” is the closest song on this album to  the earnest urgency of “Grave,” with Stump gleefully warbling over a cascade of nostalgic synths, guitar, and a driving rhythm on the drums. At the end of the song, everything but an acoustic guitar and Stump’s vocals falls away, and he sings, “Baby you were my picket fence / I miss missing you now and then.” The pain over a love lost is made all the more poignant as it is expressed in a lonely moment of the musical simplicity that Fall Out Boy has otherwise long since left behind.
 
Conversely, The titular last track of the album is an indulgent, jubilant affair featuring one Sir Elton John. Stump and John belt out together, “I will defend the faith / going down swinging / I will save the songs / The songs we can’t stop singing,” finally explicitly explaining what on earth Fall Out Boy are trying to say with the album’s title—that “saving rock and roll” means fighting for the songs that they themselves love. In fact, Stump says in no uncertain terms, “You are what you love, / Not who loves you.” Fall Out Boy is not setting out to save a genre, but rather themselves, by playing whatever songs they please, as they have always done and will continue to do, until your breathing stops.

Presencia Latina, an upcoming showcase of arts groups on campus, is more than just a show—it’s a celebration of culture, and a refusal to be labeled. This collaborative effort will feature a wide range of Harvard’s Latin culture, everything from dance to music to poetry. “We don’t have a specific theme,” says Maricela Lupercio ’15, president of Presencia Latina. “It is just celebrating all of the Latino culture here on campus through art.”
This performance is truly all-encompassing, as it is the only show on campus that incorporates all of Harvard’s Latin cultural groups. “You can’t sum up Latino culture in one club—that’s impossible. But this show tries to bring them all together and bring the community together,” board member Greta M. Solinap ’13 says. The show also makes an effort to extend an invitation to those outside of the Latin community. Any student who was interested in being a part of the showcase was invited to audition.
Multiple well-known college cultural performers will be featured this year, such as Mariachi Véritas de Harvard, Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán de Harvard, and Tufts’s Latin Ballroom club. Even youth from La Piñata, a Boston cultural group, will be coming to perform. “It’s kind of the idea that we’re not just one thing, we’re a lot of different things,” Lupercio says.
While the performance works to celebrate the many facets of Latin culture, it is simultaneously  conscious of the preconceptions that surround that culture. “Through many of the pieces we try to challenge stereotypes that Latinos and many cultural communities are held to,” talent director Jesus E. Moran ’16 says. “We definitely try to embrace our culture…through our dances and our singing. So a lot of it is Spanish dance and a lot of them are different Latin American dances, but we try to also challenge what society holds us to be.”

“The piece is truly a quartet. [It] is a lot about exploration and inquiry...there is sort of an “extra-terrestrial” quality about the dancers throughout the piece in the sense that they are trying to 'figure out' an unfamiliar space,” Irineo C. Cabreros ‘13 says. Cabreros is one of the three choreographer groups whose works will be featured this Thursday and Friday in the Harvard Dance Center. The Emerging Choreographers Showing will exhibit the work of ten student choreographers this Thursday and Friday in the Harvard Dance Center. Cabreros, Hazel A. Lever ‘13, and The Lone Window Project, a group of eight students, have been selected as the spring 2013 choreographers.
“It’s a new initiative that we started in...September 2012,” says Jill Johnson, Office for the Arts dance director. The Emerging Choreographers Initiative is an OFA Dance Program residency opportunity for student choreographers who wish to improve their skills through a mentorship with professional choreographers. Each group of choreographers works with all three mentors: Johnson, and artists-in-residence Andrea Miller and Pontus Lidberg.
“Each group has its own individual voice and very distinct ideas,” Johnson says. “So it’s just leading the choreographers [from] where they are, and add[ing] as many diverse ideas to their progress. It’s not just one voice that they consult with, but the students are rather mentored by many different voices.”
The resulting choreographies have various stylistic influences, but all have a touch of each group’s unique academic experiences. “It’s an amalgam of all of their experiences being channeled into these works,” says Johnson. “For example, it could be how they saw their concentrations meet with what they were doing in dance courses.” As an example, Johnson explained that Cabreros is a double concentrator who studies music at the New England Conservatory and physics and mathematics at Harvard. “I think his process is very much informed by his studies in music and science. Science, music, and dance have a lot in common, even in terms of generating material to render something,” Johnson says.
Johnson says she enjoyed interacting with students in the creative process. “For me, it’s been so wonderful to see each unique vision and to be able to find more growth in the students and what they’re developing, and then just watch them shine.”

This Saturday, the Bach Society Orchestra will have its fourth performance of the school year. The concert will feature three pieces: Salieri’s “La Tempest di Mare,” Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major, and Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons” with violin soloist Keir D. GoGwilt ‘13.
Time is one of the concert’s overarching themes. “We are doing this concert in conjunction with Harvard museums, which now have exhibitions on time, how it is measured and perceived,” says Lucien D. Werner ’13, the musical director of the Bach Society Orchestra. The concert is, in fact, sponsored by the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, which is currently putting on an exhibit entitled “Time and Time Again”.“‘Four Seasons’ is really a piece that can be thought of as a passage of time, and so the linkage seemed appropriate.”
Baroque music’s special relationship with time is also reflected in the pieces chosen for the concert. “In musical experience, time is reorganized in terms of musical phrases,” GoGwilt says. “[In Baroque music] you get long, arching lines, and it’s almost a different sense of time...compared to Romantic music or in contemporary music.” In order to experiment with the properties of baroque music, the Bach Society Orchestra was coached by a baroque violinist. In one rehearsal, the members practiced holding their bows at the balance point rather than at the end to approximate the feeling of the baroque bow, which was much shorter than the modern bow.
The concert will be conducted in the flexible style of a chamber e, in which the conductor, solo violinist, and the other players all become leaders. “The conductor’s role didn’t really become necessary or common until the Romantic era, where the orchestras got really large,” Werner says. He will be conducting “The Four Seasons,” during which he will simultaneously play a part on the harpsichord and give cues when appropriate.
“If we are sacrificing the more rigid synchronization of everybody playing together at the same time, instead what we are doing is feeling the freedom and nuance,” GoGwilt says.
Even though the pieces are by no means unusual, Bach Society Orchestra is still excited to explore these works. “Vivaldi’s ‘Four Seasons’ is a very popular piece—everybody knows it—but it doesn’t get played that often. So I thought it was time to do a well-known, fun piece that will perhaps have a new take,” Werner says.

"It's pure chaos, claiming a territory that doesn't belong to you to state your own identity. It's like saying, 'I've got no other way to say I exist,'" Barry McGee said of his work as a street artist in a quote displayed on the wall of his newest show. The exhibition of his work currently on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art captures this chaotic energy by bringing together McGee’s vast array of media and artistic styles. The traveling exhibit, organized by the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, is the first mid-career museum survey of the artist's work.
Although he was formally educated in painting and printmaking at the San Francisco Art Institute, McGee, like many others of his time, chose not to confine himself to museum and gallery pieces. Instead, he looked to the city itself as a site for art and activism. Working as a graffiti artist under the tag name “Twist,” he first began showing his art in the late 1980s on the streets of San Francisco's Mission District. He drew inspiration from street protests on social issues, as well as politically motivated graffiti and signage, that emerged in a city wracked with economic hardship and reeling from the AIDS crisis. More recently, he has produced large-scale installation pieces such as flipped cars and trucks, bringing the anarchic urban experience into the gallery.
“Barry McGee is one of the most important contributors to the powerful and varied body of work that has emerged out of street culture,” said Jill Medvedow, Ellen Matilda Poss director of the ICA, in a press release. “His distinctive imagery, collaborative practice, and compassionate approach to the issues and energy of the streets have had a profound influence on a generation of artists.”
Starting with some rarely seen early works, the exhibit is organized chronologically and allows visitors to step through McGee's development as an artist. The exhibit shows broad stylistic variation, with pieces ranging from small, intensely detailed monochrome drawings to vast expanses of brightly colored geometric patterns. There appear to be no bounds to the variety of media McGee utilizes—a collection of wooden busts with attached arms mechanically spray paint a gallery wall; the faces of the homeless are painted on a cascade of glass bottles; painted galley trays reminiscent of McGee's time as a typesetter form the walls of a small house. There are televisions, a dumpster, scrap wood, sheet music and graffiti-covered signs.
One thing, however, is consistent. McGee favors large, in-your-face displays. Even his smaller pieces are exhibited in his characteristic “cluster” style: large groups of individually framed pieces coming together in a mass of imagery. One such display, made anew for each location the exhibition visits, bulges outward from the wall. “This large wall that visitors encounter head on was perfect. McGee likes to fill walls, and when given such a vast wall, he chose to fill edge to edge. The boil at the ICA seems to be the largest created so far,” wrote Jenelle Porter, Mannion Family senior curator at the ICA, who coordinated the exhibit. Porter was interviewed over email because of travel-related scheduling conflicts.
McGee installed the entirety of the exhibit's last room himself, calling it “The Boston Contemporary Art Center.” Here he reflects on his transition from street artist to museum artist: he presents in glass display cases items such as old bricks and Ziploc bags stuffed full of napkin drawing, piles his surfboards in a corner, and gives much of the space over to the work of other artists, including that of two Boston graffiti artists. “[This] is an astute and satirical way for McGee to show his newest paintings and sculptures, as well as to include collaborators who have been integral to his artwork,” Porter wrote.
Despite McGee's self-consciousness, Porter believes his work elegantly bridges the worlds of street and gallery and saw no challenge in capturing his aesthetic in a museum setting. “He is an artist, and we make art shows,” she wrote.

The long and storied history of the Flaming Lips can be divided into two halves: before-“The Soft Bulletin” and after-“The Soft Bulletin.” Their 1997 release marked the beginnings of mainstream success as the experimental rock group turned to space rock and noise pop in “Soft Bulletin” and “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.” In 2006, “At War with the Mystics” only further muddled the the band’s sound world, and the release of “Embryonic” three years later brought a new, sinister dimension to the Lips’ canon, slipping hints of fatalistic malevolence into sci-fi themes. Given their sprawling discography, the first question that must be raised with the Lips’ latest release is: what exactly is it? Although “The Terror” carries much of the experimental flavor of their previous releases, the Lips connect with something much more primal on their latest release: the emotion of fear itself.
Fully abandoning the Lips’ brief affair with noise pop, the first track off of “The Terror” is expansively symphonic. “Look… The Sun Is Rising” is a tone poem disguised as a song, with even the cutting, simple lyrics and Wayne Coyne’s vaporous vocals contributing to the mixture. Against a mosaic of wispy synthesizers, aggressive guitars, and an explosive drum machine, Coyne croons portentously, “Love is always something, something you should fear / When you really listen, fear is all you hear.” Like the rest of the album, “Look… The Sun Is Rising” is lyrically reminiscent of the Lips’ concept material, and the unsettling opener quickly establishes a menacing palette for the rest of “The Terror.”
As the album develops, the tracks become more opaque and, at times, completely impalpable. The Lips cultivate an impersonal, synthetic sound, never coming close to sounding like a rock band. The broken-record effect created by the repetitive, stop-and-go pattern of the synthesizers on tracks like the amorphous “You Are Alone” creates a sterile, almost lifeless landscape eroded by synthesized wind and structured only by a mechanical drum beat. Even the more rhythmic tracks like “Butterfly, How Long It Takes To Die” don’t feel driven, but rather governed by methodical machinery, like a clock in an empty room counting down to some ominous end.
This persistently unerring sound is often coupled with mysteriously pithy lyrics. On “Try To Explain,” the track that comes closest to being a love song, Coyne sings, “A love that explodes, convulsing your body / Your only hand extending in the deep.” “Be Free, A Way” is a shadow of “Look… The Sun Is Rising,” pulsing at the same frequency but more calmly and composedly. The lyrics mirror those of the previous track, inquiring, “Is love the God that we control / to try to trust the pain?” In fact, the album is full of such questioning and, outside of the first track, nothing seems to resolve with any clarity. Fittingly, the chorus of “You Are Alone” is simply the repetition of “You’re not alone / You are alone,” which, instead of being vapid, adds to the uncomfortably fantastic mystique of “The Terror.”
The masterwork of the album is “You Lust,” a track that spins like a cosmic sphere for 13 minutes before transforming suddenly into an icy still-life. One of the only tracks on the album that features a self-aware narrator, “You Lust” becomes the voice of reason in a distorted world, struggling at the mercy of a malevolent higher power. “You’ve got a lot of nerve / A lot of nerve to fuck with me,” begins Coyne indignantly, only to later resign to his fate as he declares, “When you pull the switch on us, I don’t really want to know.” Despite the nebulous nature of “The Terror,” its nine tracks are thematically linked. It is on “You Lust” that this theme is elucidated: “I began to understand it, myself,” a garbled female voice reports near the track’s end before disappearing into a blanket of synthesized bliss. Perhaps what is most terrifying isn’t the knowledge of something horrible, but the emptiness of not knowing anything at all.
By this point on the album, the true nature of “The Terror” is laid bare before us: this album isn’t the concept album that “Yoshimi” was, nor the collection of space-pop tracks that was “Soft Bulletin,” nor the strange experiment that was “Zaireeka.” Instead, “The Terror” is the Flaming Lips’ attempt to explore a pure emotion. Their emotion of choice—fear—feels strangely at home in the metallic, uneasy synthesizers that swamp the album. For such an endeavor, however, “The Terror” unfortunately leaves us with little resolution. The final track, “Always There, In Our Hearts,” serves as an eerie and disturbing coronation, a bleakly despondent summary that does little more than reiterate the disheartened themes of internalized evil.
“The Terror” succeeds precisely because it revels in what are normally musical downfalls. An emotionally removed sound, repetitive instrumentals, and simple lyrics only help set the album in a foreign, threatening atmosphere. Though other bands may buckle under the weight of devoting an entire album to a specific sentiment, the Flaming Lips refuse to shy away. “The Terror” is a journey into our own hearts, an album embedded in the primal fear of the unknown and unfamiliar.

9th Wonder, Pete Rock, and DJ Premier are three of the biggest names in hip-hop, and have worked with some truly impressive acts. 9th Wonder, Hiphop archive fellow at Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois institute for African and African-American Research, has worked with heavy hitters like Jay-Z, Destiny’s Child, and Drake; the world-renowned Pete Rock has worked with some of the biggest names in classic hip-hop like Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., and Public Enemy; and DJ Premier, who has been featured in countless greatest hip-hop producers lists, has worked with a wide range of artists, from Kanye West to Snoop Dogg to Christina Aguilera. These three hip-hop giants were the centerpiece of the event “Digging the Music of Hiphop: These are the standards” last Wednesday, which was sponsored by the Hiphop Archive at Harvard. The discussion was held in Memorial Church encompassed a variety of topics in hip-hop, including its evolution, its cultural significance, and the artistic inspirations of the revered panelists.
To open the panel discussion, Marcyliena Morgan, professor of African and African American studies and executive director of the Hiphop Archive, explained why hip-hop and its DJs carry the weight that they do in the African American community. “When we think about mixing, when we think about the idea of freestyle, when we think about producers and DJs, we’re thinking about people who are reimagining, recreating, reformulating, and also helping us to remember, to make sure we have a way of reaching back.” Though Morgan framed the event as a grandiose examination of hip-hop, 9th Wonder, who served as both the host and a panelist, then guided the conversation in a more personal direction. This catalyzed the producers recounting interesting stories, including how they got their hip-hop starts and their most memorable moments once in the hip-hop industry.
Perhaps one of the most notable of these stories was that of Pete Rock, who met James Brown at the age of seven. “When he shook my hand, he told me, ‘God bless you,’ and he passed on the funk to me. I wasn’t the same after that,” Rock said. Rock also described his experience with Jay-Z and the interaction between the star rapper’s perfectionism and imperiousness. Early on in Jay-Z’s career, Rock, who was at a recording, questioned the delivery of one of the verses. Though Jay-Z was quite adamant that his rapping was flawless, he eventually caved, abandoning his pride in favor of a better track.
Though hearing about colossi of musicians like Jay-Z and James Brown was engaging, the parts of the event that received the most reactions from the audience were the musical insertions. As songs were brought up in the conversation, 9th Wonder would cue them up on his computer, and the audience was unmistakably responsive. Only a few were able to resist the ubiquity of the head bob as some of the best beats that Hiphop has ever heard reverberated in Memorial Church.
After a series of audience questions, the event concluded with each of the panelists explaining the new projects that he was working on as well as possible new career paths. Pete Rock revealed that he is working on an album with Roy Ayers, as well as other collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige, and others. DJ Premier’s biggest name drop was LL Cool J. Rock then added on a few more: “I’ve got Joey Badass that I’m working with, as well; Robert Glasper, he’s a jazz pianist; and Mos Def.”
9th Wonder said his current interest lies in the Jamla Records imprint of his music group and that he was particularly excited about working with Rapsody, a highly acclaimed female rapper. He also would like to make further pursuits as a Harvard fellow. “I want to be tied to this university as far as making a way to start an institution for hip-hop.”

Do you like the Spice Girls?  The men of “DOGS” do, and they took the song to places one would never expect. “DOGS,” which ran until Saturday in the Loeb Ex, was an updated, live-theater version of Quentin Tarantino’s 1992 film “Reservoir Dogs,” a chilling fall into the pit of armed robbery. The transition from film to theater is often a tricky one because the director loses the ability to edit and use zoom or special effects. Though sometimes weakened by the new form, the adaptation by director Sam S. Richman ’15 used the advantages of live theater as well as superb acting, and excellent design to make the production stand on its own as a play.
Indeed, most aspects of the story actually came across better on stage than on film. Nini’s ’90s radio station, an updated version of the ’70s soundtrack used in the movie, tied the fragments of plot together, and instead of a blank screen as a transition, “DOGS” made Nini (Simone E. Polanen ’14) at her DJ station a focal point to accompany set transitions. Sound designer James B. Pollack ’14 also let the songs provide a musical backdrop for the show’s action. The music was as much a part of the design as the the lights or the warehouse in which most of the production took place. The Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” was juxtaposed against a torture scene, and other ’90s hits were used as settings both seriously and ironically. Audience members were even able to text in song requests during intermission, which allowed for more interaction with the performance.
Richman incorporated many aspects into his production that created a genuine Tarantino aesthetic. He made a cameo as Mr. Brown, an unimportant gang member who appeared in only a few scenes, as Tarantino did in his film. The warehouse, designed by Zena M. S. Mengesha ’14, was in keeping with the tone of the original film; it was stark and spare, while lights designed by Alice F. Hyde ’16 and Adam O. Brodheim ’16 brought out the roughness of the set. A single blue light washed the stage with an icy glow, and the spot that lit up Nini’s corner on the balcony was enough to separate the spaces while highlighting the action.
The acting was strong across the board, each performance different enough from the iconic Tarantino ones to give “DOGS” a fresh feel. The good guys were well-developed characters, but it was really the men in suits who stood out. Benjamin J. Lorenz ’14 made the act of dying from a stomach wound into an art; with no film tricks to rely on, he did an admirable job of conveying unbearable pain—for almost an hour. Mr. White (James C. C. Butler ’15) set the tone of the show as a hardened antihero who asks whether an aggressively neurotic Mr. Pink (Jonathan J. S. Longcroft ’15) killed “any real people,” as opposed to cops. Andrew N. Shindi ’13 was appropriately threatening yet fatherly as Joe Cabot, and his incompetent son Eddie was played by a fun, bouncy Taylor A. Cressler ’14. However, it was Daniel J. M. Hilhorst ’15 who stole the show as the psychopathic Mr. Blonde, terrifyingly laid back instead of homicidally cold.
Unfortunately, the fight choreography by Matthew W. G. Walker ’16 could not live up to the cinematographic expertise required for such a violent, threatening show. Simpler fight scenes with punches and kicks just did not quite seem to work on the stage, and the palpable conflict often disappeared when physical fights were involved. Blood abounded, but it was ultimately unconvincing—a detached ear looked so fake that much of the horror was lost.
Aside from the occasionally fake portrayal of violent scenes, the lack of set and design contrasts possible in a small theater caused the performance to suffer during flashback scenes. Though Joe’s office was meant to be the den of the mafia don, it just looked sad and empty. Likewise, a bedroom, a train bathroom, and a bar were ultimately unconvincing because the set was not entirely realistic nor minimal, but instead an uncomfortable compromise. The best of the flashbacks was Mr. Pink’s recollection of running from the shootout at the jewelry store, as it used no set change or props, but instead was separated by lights, sound, and clear acting. When “DOGS” embraced the stage instead of imitating the film it was more successful in making the complicated transitions clear.
The transformation of “DOGS” into a stage play succeeded because of the largely good design, effective use of sound and music, and excellent group of actors. As morally ambiguous as the original, “DOGS” added attitude and youth to the original premise. From the beginning of the show, when the actors strode through the waiting crowd outside the Loeb Ex, they immersed themselves in their characters and emphasized the best aspect of a live theater adaptation—being in the room with “the professionals” instead of viewing them through a screen.

An unconventional love story about two interchanging couples, “Closer,” which opens on Friday in the Loeb Ex, could either be the perfect show or the worst show to take your date to. Exploring the selfish and sadistic motives of love, the play promises to be as abrasive and irresistible as a destructive relationship.
"’Closer’ is brutally honest, I think that's what I like about it. There are no bells and whistles. It is quite raw and bare," says Lily R. Glimcher '14, a first-time director. "I wanted a play with a small cast that would allow me to explore the complex psyche of these characters and their relationships.
"The play was originally written and staged by British playwright Patrick Marber in 1997, but Millennials might be more familiar with the 2004 film adaptation starring Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen.
“I told my actors not to watch the movie,” Glimcher says. Instead, she hopes to revisit the darker intrigues and intricacies behind the characters in the original script. Dan (Max R. McGillivray ’16) struggles between his two loves for his fragile stripper girlfriend Alice (Rachel A. Gibian ’15) and the stern, sophisticated Anna (Georgina B. Parfitt ’13), wife of the brutish Larry (Jacob A. Brandt ’14), who falls for Alice in this love square.
"There are no good guys or bad guys. Everyone who sees this show is going to find character traits that reveal the best and worst of themselves in a very real way," co-producer Brianne Holland-Stergar '13 says.
Glimcher had to work with the actors to make sure that they were not just comfortable with each other but with themselves as well.
"Rehearsals are just like therapy because you bring in things that you feel and have experienced in your own relationships,” Parfitt says.
For these reasons acting in or seeing the play might feel a bit like couples' therapy. "It's a frank, emotional, very human...experience of feelings," Parfitt says. "And, need I mention, it's sexy! There will be a lot of kissing."

“He Who Burns” ended with the dizzying turning of a lone white dancer against a darkened stage, recalling whirling Turkish Dervishes and flickering candle flames. The spinning sequence, like the performance as a whole, showcased both the admirable stamina and grace of the dancers and the over-ambitious and often confused choices of the director, choreographer and dancer Wendy Jehlen, a Harvard Divinity School graduate. “He Who Burns” played at Farkas Hall until Saturday night and was presented by the Harvard College Pakistan Students Association and Harvard Pakistani Students Group, with support from the Prince Alwaheed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program, Harvard University Asia Center, and Harvard South Asia Institute. The multi-modal performance was at its best transfixing, calming, and transcendentally mystifying, though at times it slipped into self-indulgent heavy-handedness in its delivery of the core Sufi themes. Though explained in the Q-and-A session after the show, the incoherent and jumbled direction of the narrative ultimately isolated far more than it invited.
Through the media of dance, poetry, and music, Jehlen sought to tell the epic story of the sorrows of Iblis, the Sufi version of Satan, who is aflame with love for God. However, Iblis refuses to kow-tow to Adam (dancer Pradhuman Nayak), despite the insistence of God, and is banished from his presence and his love. It’s hard not to be reminded of Milton’s “Paradise Lost” and the sympathetic Satan. Unlike the epic poem, “He Who Burns” is a disjointed collection of seven acts, which can come across as a confusing narrative, especially for an audience unfamiliar with the Sufi tradition. Even with the aid of translations from Urdu to English projected on the screen behind the dancers and an explanatory program, the confusing progression of scenes and jarringly sudden ending left the plot details largely perplexing.
Jehlen did, however, make good use of the projector screen to cast an ever-changing kaleidoscope of colors that reflected subtle mood and texture changes in the music. Lighting by Stephen Petrilli also provided great visual beauty, especially to mostly silent scenes in which the show’s three dancers were bathed in light. Petrilli’s creative lighting made the dancers resemble lanterns juxtaposed against a dark night sky. This highlighted the binaries of light and dark, good and evil, fire and clay that pervaded the whole performance. The Sufi poetry translations in English showed the rich depth of Sufi poets such as Mansur Al-Hallaj and Hafiz, who provide compelling spiritual aphorisms on love and loss. One line in particular reflected both the title and theme of the play. Iblis describes love “to be like the flame of the candle always burning,” thereby invoking the theme of fire and light. All three dancers moved with fluid and effortless synergy, mastering the interplay of strength and softness of movement.
The God and Iblis dancers, Jun Lee and Jehlen respectively, moved particularly well together in a sort of caressing, tender unity that underscored Iblis’s adoration of God. Just as the screen translated Iblis’s declaration that “the sea of love is a sea that has no shore,” Jehlen copied the curvatures of Lee’s body, mapping out the same extensions and energy. It was hard not to see these dancers at times as artwork in motion, with one particular scene towards the end of the performance showing the three dancers in a state of stillness, forming a series of manneristic and statuesque poses. Sign language too was woven intelligently into the contemporary and traditional dance forms, strengthening the corporal narrative and its meaning.
The choreography at times tested the viewer’s patience. The beautiful, flower-like extensions at the beginning were offset by slow, prolonged pockets of silence and darkness that precariously teetered on the edge of being heavy-handed and awkward. While there were moments of fast-paced movement and execution that recalled elements of Kung Fu martial arts, these were too few and far between and contributed little to the narrative arc.
The Zen music that accompanied the production, under the direction of Nandlal Nayak, was at times soporific, but also haunting and beautiful, pulsating with a transcendental yogic energy. Pan flutes, shehnais and percussion could be heard, along with the insertion of contemporary techno music mid-way through the performance. The integration of modern music, however, seemed to have little conceptual purpose and offered no deeper insight.
Despite their efforts to make the play comprehensible, with so many languages—English, Urdu and sign language—the play remained at its close bewildering. Jehlen said in the Q-and-A session that the performance was a personal religious experience, but she failed to open that experience up to the audience and flesh out an understanding of Iblis’s pursuit of unity with God through self-annihilation. “He Who Burns” offered a fascinating, enriching portal into Sufi spirituality but was hindered ultimately by an execution that was shrouded in some level of obscurity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Years ago, when a K-pop artist released a new song, it was deemed a success if fans at home received the song with open arms. That is not the case anymore. As the clock struck midnight on KApril 12 worldwide, the song “Gentleman,” rapper PSY’s follow-up single to “Gangnam Style,” was released in 119 countries. Within minutes of the single’s release, people began to debate whether PSY would be  a “one-hit wonder” in the Western Hemisphere.
It’s also worth considering which acts may be the ones to follow PSY’s lead in solidifying their presence in America. The “Big 3” Entertainment corporations— S.M. Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, and YG Entertainment—have all shown signs of business ventures in the States. For instance, consider S.M. Entertainment’s partnership with Interscope Records for international projects involving lucrative girl group Girls’ Generation, as well as YG Entertainment’s partnership between Will.i.Am and hip-hop girl group 2NE1 (in fact, the group is featured on the tracklist of his upcoming studio album, #willpower) and Creative Artists Agency’s representation of YG rapper PSY.
While there are numerous sub-genres under the greater umbrella of “popular Korean music” (such as talented ballad singer K. Will, indie-folk group Busker Busker, or rock band CN BLUE), here are a few groups worth watching for a potential breakthrough in the U.S. mainstream market.
 
2NE1
 
In sharp contrast with the plethora of pretty-polished-pop images of many female groups, 2NE1 exudes an edgy persona. From angsty song, “Ugly,” to addictive club hit, “I Am the Best,” the group brings a commanding stage presence and loud personality. The members’ experimental fashion has forged them a relationship with designer Jeremy Scott, who called leader CL his “muse” in a recent interview with ELLE. They have collaborated with Will.i.Am in the track for the Intel Ultrabook  promotional video, and a formal U.S. debut for the group is rumored. In Will.i.Am’s words: “They [2NE1] care about fashion, dope beats, cool melodies—the perfect marriage between their style and my style.” In 2011, 2NE1 took home the MTV Iggy award for “Best New Band In The World.” The organic relationships that 2NE1 have formed with well-known artists, both within and outside the world of K-pop, and their sheer talent are indicative of a potential worldwide takeover.
 
 
t윤미래 (Yoon Mi Rae/Tasha Reid)
 
Native Texan Yoon Mi Rae has established herself as South Korea’s most formidable and talented female hip-hop and R&B singer and rapper. Represented by Jungle Entertainment, Yoon Mi Rae not only performs solo, but has also worked with Korean hip-hop crew the Movement, the hip-hop project group MFBTY, and her husband Tiger JK, another well-respected Korean rapper. She grew up in the U.S., born to a Korean mother and an African American father, and she experienced discrimination growing up. She now vocally serves as an ambassador for multicultural youth, even rapping about her experiences. Her powerful life story, her fluency in both Korean and English, and her talented rapping could successfully capture foreign audiences.
 
 
Big Bang
 
Following their debut as a boy band in 2006, Big Bang have solidified their place as artists in the world of K-pop. They incorporate strains of hip-hop, R&B, pop, and balladry in their music—almost entirely composed and produced by leader G-Dragon—and earlier this year concluded their first world tour, “Big Bang Alive Galaxy Tour.” From their earlier pop releases like “거짓말 (Lies)” and “하루하루 (Haru Haru),” Big Bang have shown an ability to adapt to changing music trends while still maintaining their own colour, such as in their recent high-energy, wacky dance track “Fantastic Baby” to sensitive, R&B tunes like “Blue.” Vocalists Taeyang, Seungri, and Daesung have all enjoyed successful solo stints in between projects, and rappers G-Dragon and T.O.P enjoyed a collaboration with famous producer Diplo on track “뻑이가요 (Knock Out).”
 
 
f(x)
This electropop quintet is often regarded as more “experimental” than the other cookie-cutter pop groups produced under label S.M. Entertainment. The girl group made waves as the first K-pop idol group to play at SXSW this March, and even made a Funny Or Die comedy sketch featuring actress Anna Kendrick. The group not only made its global footprint, but expressed an attentiveness to the differences in audiences that it encounters outside of Korea following their performance at SXSW: “I think SXSW is a must for K-pop idols.... K-pop idols are used to big stadiums. It’s the intimacy with fans that makes SXSW special. It was a crowd of people that were curious about K-pop along with K-pop fans. SXSW definitely broadens horizons.” This cultural awareness, catchy electronic tunes, and ability to fluently converse with Korean, Mandarin, and English-speaking audiences makes them a group worth watching.
 
 
Girls’ Generation
After making a solid entrance into K-pop with the bubblegum pop song “Gee,” the nine-member female group has experienced a tremendous growth in sound, most evident in its recent hit, “I Got a Boy.” This past summer, members Taeyeon, Tiffany, and Seohyun impressed fans by showcasing their developed vocals in the track “Twinkle,” released under subgroup Taetiseo (TTS), while member Hyoyeon brought the house down with her skillful dancing on the Korean version of “Dancing With the Stars.” Girls’ Generation’s first international single, “The Boys,” was produced by Teddy Riley, famous for his work with Michael Jackson. Following its release, the group even performed the track live on “The Late Show with David Letterman” and “Live! With Kelly.” Already lucrative in Korea and Japan, the nine-member group has a physically powerful stage presence and a polished versatility to boot.
B.A.P
The newest group on this list, B.A.P debuted in 2012 with "Warrior." Since then, the six member group has garnered attention for their solid live performances, even leading MTV Korea to comment on their versatility. While many groups tend to lean on one main vocalist, vocalists Dae Hyun and Youngjae both boast impressive vocal range, and Yong Guk and Zelo also add to the group's unique sound with their contrasting, spit-fire rap styles. B.A.P impressed fans with their powerful "push up choreography" in single, "One Shot." Verizon Wireless is sponsoring B.A.P's first foray into the USA in May for the company's annual 2013 APAHM (Asian Pacific American Heritage Month) tour. Keep your eyes out for this group.

Their house was filled with books that no one read, a piano that nobody played, and paintings that nobody looked at. There was a dog that no one loved and a white picket fence that kept nobody out and held no one in. It was shadow play—all the right shapes but no substance. This poster picture of the American Dream was like a set, and they were only actors. 
 
Dad had never seen a bootstrap, and if he had, he wouldn’t have known what to do with it, let alone complete the unfinished metaphor. Mom had come from middle-aged money, and they’d married young. Vanity, property, stability.
 
Their days were filled with conspicuous leisure and consumption, and everything was completely comfortable. Though they’d lived there for years, the house and its contents looked brand new. Their lives were kept clean and routine, and everything was in order. And everyone was in order. The system worked. There was to be no more revolution because they had arrived. Liberty, equality, fixity.
 
Each novel statement was made with a nervous “ha-ha” that sputtered out at the end, diluting its personality. This laugh-like sound that was more of a whimper was indicative of their nature—never quite confident in what they said or whether such an individual utterance would disrupt the well-oiled social mechanism. Better to laugh it off than to stand out. Certainty, conformity, ubiquity.
 
They did what they were supposed to do. Socialization materialized in the form of the block party or backyard barbeque in accordance with convention, a prescribed communal gesture and a display of civilization. The warmth and smells of springtime passed by them unacknowledged. They compared notes on living with the neighbors like kids circulating copied answers in class. And in a unison fostered by falsified affinity, they cringed into smiles that fooled all and none. So they floundered in spontaneous human interaction until they could draw down the blinds and retreat to their controlled atmospheres of televisioned bedrooms and radioed silences.
 
When news of distant trouble came on, they turned off the tube. A mindless “just awful” smoothed out the ripples, and a return to reading “Sports” and “Style” restored order quickly. The company misery required would not be found in them. They had no room for sadness. Beauty and felicity were messy and inutile, and love a waste of time. So, they rejected these forms of selfish greed. The very notion of the soul had become quaint.
 
Their secure society was to live on forever, and the inertia of safety allowed them to carry on in this way, unconcerned.
 
The characters were flat, and there was no climax. Of course, there was some ceremony in  traditional acknowledgment of life as generations eased in and faded out quietly like so many dusks and dawns. When they were born, they were enveloped in the fold without song and dance.
 
And at their funerals nobody cried because they didn’t know how.

Soul music is built on the back of the little guy. As I’ve mentioned before in this column, most of Motown’s classics were recorded by a group of little-known musicians called the Funk Brothers. They put together the backing music for almost all of the record label’s hits—in fact, according to the documentary “Standing in the Shadows of Motown,”  they have between them more number 1s than the Beatles, Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones, and the Beach Boys combined. Other soul labels worked in a similar way. For example, Stax Records employed Booker T and the M.G.’s as their studio band, where they recorded songs for the likes of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, and Sam & Dave.
All these grooves had to come from somewhere, however. Most of these musicians got their start playing in blues bars and jazz clubs before being scooped up by scouts for the record labels. And even though these guys wound up playing pop music, they remained jazz and blues musicians at heart, and their musical sensibilities shaped the future of the genre. In a very real sense, soul’s distinctive sound is a result of the combination of the jazz and blues training of the studio musicians, the gospel records that the singers grew up listening to, and the business savvy of the label owners. Despite the rigidity of the soul genre—dictated as much by the demands of AM radio as by the musical tastes of the artists—the musicians occasionally slipped a little of their old selves into their work. Sometimes, probably when the studio execs were out of the office, the band got to record songs that sound a little more blues than soul.
Case in point: Don Bryant, who spent most of his time at Memphis-based Hi Records writing hits for other people—including his future wife Ann Peebles and Al Green—finally got his shot at the big time in 1969. Unfortunately, the album he recorded, called “Precious Soul,” sank to undeserved obscurity almost immediately after it was released. The tenth track on the record is a funky number called “She’s Looking Good,” originally made popular by Wilson Pickett. The song is based around a pitter-patter drum beat and features a guitar line more reminiscent of a fast Chicago blues than a downtempo Memphis sound, but then starts to sound more like a classic southern soul song as the horns blast out a pretty standard line.This sound is enhanced by Bryant’s powerful voice. It has the impressive range and heart-stopping, gospel- influenced wails used by singers across the genre. However, every time the song seems to be drifting towards a normal sound, the guitar bursts in, playing a pentatonic riff full of flat thirds and blues notes, just as a reminder of what the guitarist is capable of. The result is an interesting pull built into the track. It is very much a classic soul song in its construction and orchestration, but with an edge that looks back to the genre’s roots.
“She’s Looking Good” handles this dichotomy extraordinarily well. At no point does the song feel disjointed, nor do any of its constituent parts seem out of place. Given the history of both the artist and the record label, which worked with local blues and rockabilly artists as well as soul, this shouldn’t be surprising. The musicians who defined soul as a genre were actually working within a pre-existing framework. They were raised on blues, gospel, and jazz, and they incorporated all of these styles into the pop music that they were creating. When we look back at the sounds made in the past, we tend to both simplify and glorify the artists we revere. Musicians like Don Bryant and the Hi Rhythm Section that supported him were certainly incredibly talented, but they didn't really invent anything. “She’s Looking Good” sounds like a fast blues because in a lot of ways it is a fast blues, just in a different form. The genius of soul musicians was found in how they recombined pre-existing themes and in the process made something wonderful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I sit on the steps of Memorial Hall, gazing somewhat predatorily on the bobbing hems of camel, smoke, and coal-colored coats. In one week, Thomas N. Dai ’14 will tell me that fashion journalism sometimes prematurely wishes to merely categorize trends, and that this is dangerously reductive. But how else can I sufficiently inspire myself to make observations about The State of Harvard Fashion when Columbia fleece #1, tapping an iPhone, collides rather violently with Columbia fleece #2? Here passes a girl wrapped in indigo skinny jeans tucked into brown leather riding boots; she holds a navy blue Longchamp bag crushed into her Barbour coat, and then she passes a woman thrice her age wearing the exact same thing. Oops.
When I walk through the yard, I don’t hold a cardboard sign with resume-ready writing samples printed neatly for your judgment. VES students don’t display their rousing photographs on the outsides of their cardboard rolls. The winners of Lamont library’s Visiting Committee book-collecting prize do not wheel around a cart of signed first editions. When an apparent musician strolls by, we don’t know if that black case contains a violin or a tommy gun. But even for those not vocationally creative, fashion and style is displayed freely on the street, and for those with an artistic perspective, it is a dialectic of “appearance is important” and “this is who I am right now.” Here at Harvard, those who have taken on a mantle of advancing fashion as art simply want students to take risks: wear that crazy print, leather vest, or ’40s dress. But for some, the truth of the matter lies in the simple question: if you saw someone wearing what you are, would you want to get to know them?
STYLED ORGANIZATION 
Harvard offers several official outlets for those interested in the construction and display of clothing: Identities; Eleganza; Vestis, a newly begun fashion magazine on campus, and costume design for HRDC productions. For those interested in style that goes beyond the normal day-to-day uniform, overlap of membership between organizations is common practice.
Jay A. Drummond ’15 sits in front of me in a casual button-up looking quite relieved that the school day is over. Hailing from Cypress, TX, Drummond moved to Harvard from a land of camo suits, flattened caps, and overalls worn commando. He rushed toward the opportunity to make fashion his extracurricular focus, joining Eleganza, Identities, and Vestis his freshman year. Now, striking out on his own independent of these organizations, he offers the perfect scope for comparison between them.
“The vision Identities definitely wants to put forward is haute couture, traditional fashion-week fashion show. Like a Night in Milan or something,” he says. “Eleganza is more a spectacle centered around fashion. This is definitely BlackCAST putting their stamp on it. It’s theater, dance, and the works, and you get all of that and some sex.” For Drummond, Vestis would more ideally bolster a year-around sense of community for people interested in fashion.
Drummond’s own personal style is rather a rejection of Ivy League-collegiate style, and he dresses primarily to fit his mood. Asked about the style of Harvard students, he eyes me mischievously and takes a big breath. “Oh, don’t get me started. You don’t want to talk to me. Most other people have good things to say, but I own one blazer! You’re catching me on a lucky day with this button-up shirt. I’m much more about skater,” he says. “I’m using my clothing to express myself, and inside I am a middle-school child. Good Charlotte is on the radio—but not really. Don’t judge me.”
Drummond is more of a moderate in terms of what he wishes Harvard students would improve upon. For him, it’s not only about the end result—the outfit that would put any Sartorialist post to shame—but also about the process of expressing oneself. “The easiest way that people identify is through clothes. Sometimes there is a disconnect between knowing that appearance matters and actively doing something about it without doing what somebody told you to…But I don’t know why that disconnect exists. It might be stress or ‘I just woke up from an all-nighter,’” he says. “There’s very little making it your own. Even if you look at a magazine, you’ll think ‘I want to emulate that.’”
Whitney T. Gao ’16, a freshman who was on the production team for Identities, looks towards traditional sources such as magazines like Elle, InStyle, and Teen Vogue for ideas to inform her style. She also has noticed a sort of uniformity that expresses itself mostly as professional everyday wear and has come to appreciate deviations. “I like it when people take more risks,” she says. “[At Harvard] there’s a spectrum of people who really care about how they look. And then there are some people that go out sweatpants and don’t really care. And most people are in between.” For her, playing off of what is popular in magazines can lend a fresh perspective to classic fashion.
For other sources of inspiration besides magazines and runways, street style fashion blogs can be a local source for ideas and also a reminder that fashion can be engaged daily. Jack A. Pretto ’14 is the creative director for Identities and the mind behind The Offbeat Bowtie, a Harvard-centric fashion blog. For Pretto, his interest in photography and fashion collided to create a holistic picture that takes in more than the clothes themselves.
“What interests me is that I really like the environment people are in and how that works with what they’re wearing. The photo is more interesting to me than the outfit—making the photo work with the context it’s surrounded by,” he says, camera in front of him.
Last year, Pretto gave a speech for Harvard Speaks entitled “Fashion as Unavoidable Art” about both art history and modern street fashion photography.
“I thought it would be a more interesting speech than if I just talked about the blog. While a lot of people already think fashion is art, my goal was more explaining where fashion and art kind of meet, like Yoko Ono and Opening Ceremony—just seeing an overlap of these ideas,” he says. “It’s this thing where people don’t realize it, but they’re in it. If I have this garment and it’s made like this, what is its origin? Does it come from art or architecture?”
Inspiration from art and architecture also influences Susannah L. Maybank ’15, who designs and produces her own clothing; this year she will contribute pieces to Eleganza. For Maybank, an interest in fashion was born young: she learned to sew at three, started making her own clothes at eight, and began creating her own patterns two years ago. Her inspiration comes from her focus in 20th-century German architecture in the History of Art and Architecture department combined with a more general love of the past.
“When I grew up, I would watch black and white movies with my father. And we would sit there and critique all these famous femme fatales from the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s. So my style has never been contemporary-based,” she says. “I’m not a messy dresser. I like things to be fitted and tucked in and neat. I was described in high school as looking like someone’s grandmother.”
When I interviewed her, Maybank’s outfit was more one of a well-established, confident actress like Julie Andrews who just also happens to be a grandmother: smooth lines, rich grays, and conservative but not plain. To construct her clothes, Maybank culls from this retro inspiration via vintage stores like Second Time Around as well as Oona’s and the GAP for affordable knit fabric to cut up and rework. In addition to viewing fashion as an artistic process, she sees it as a way to discern personality.
“I’m just happy when I see someone wearing something that you can tell is so incredibly unique to that person. I don’t expect anyone to dress like me or to wear anything that I’d like. They’re wearing it because they love it and are following their own inspiration, not necessarily what they see mirrored around them. Anything that tells me a little bit about that person.”
***
Is there a golden ratio of thigh—61.8 percent skin and the remainder fabric—that somehow appeals to the eye? Yes, the night is young, and a veritable chorus line of young women in their best approximations of Hervé Léger bandage dresses and young men in tieless tuxedos spill out onto the runway of Mt. Auburn. This is “trying”; certainly, there are no sweatpants here. The women are wearing low-platform, three-inch-heel wedges (most likely a compromise between flats, which are not trying, and stilettos that pestle the mortar of Cambridge sidewalks). All of the men are smoking cigarettes—the ash dropping on black and navy blazers. Everybody really is a bright, young thing, but I agree with Jay that there are few risks here, no mutations or attempts to set oneself apart; there really isn’t even a feeling of ‘I want to stand out and be beautiful or handsome,” for how can a glittery star in a constellation capture your attention surrounded by so many of its kind?
 ONE-MAN SHOW
Maura A. McGrath ’15 stands out, surrounded by none of her kindred fashion spirits—Japanese street style artists. Today, a pink-ribbon-brimmed hat covers her glasses, the chunky frames of which resemble pixels. Cumulatively, McGrath rotates between more American conventional wear like skinny jeans and t-shirts and a dramatic combination of layered, elaborate skirts, a litany of hair color changes throughout the year, and on occasion, a pair of arresting lavender contacts.
“I don’t think I dress beautifully, because that’s kind of not the point,” she says. “Generally, it’s more if I saw a person walking down the street wearing what I was wearing, would I think “do I want to know them?” And if I wouldn’t want to know me, then why would I want to be me?”
McGrath’s interest in fashion began during her gap year, when she discovered Tumblr, which served as a more satisfying, diverse source of fashion inspiration compared to her prior haunts, like Lookbook.
McGrath found that artists and models on Tumblr encouraged alternative ways of thinking about personal style. “Like Minori. She is this shironuri artist who paints her skin white and has these crazy hair wigs. It’s very beautiful,” she says. “But [she’s] no longer a person. It’s an object that’s been dropped, not for our admiration, but just to show a different kind of a being. It makes me realize that there are more options than jeans and a t-shirt.”McGrath also uses fashion as a means of personal expression, but more in the sense that she believes it gives her a mark of individuality that has come to define her person.
“I’m not a phenomenal writer, a math genius, or the most caring person in the world…. There’s nothing that marks me out as an individual that has a place here. If I didn’t dress the way I did, I’d lose that,” she says. “I say, ‘oh, I dress differently,’ but then by saying that, I feel so stuck-up. Then I have to explain to people that it’s not because I’m stuck up, but just because I need that.”
In the case of one Thomas Dai, he had no idea that his Harvard career would find a similar sense of joy and identity from fashion. Dai recently finished producing Identities, worked as creative director for the show last year, worked for Eleganza his freshman year, took an internship last summer at net-a-porter.com, and will publish a fashion magazine this week through Vestis.
And yet, even though he has become a person heavily associated with the fashion scene on campus, Dai had little idea when he came to Harvard that the professional dress style of many students would be his onus to become more aware. “My style has gotten a lot more serious in college. I come from a place where I could be wearing just a fitted shirt and jeans and feel dressy. And then you come here and everyone is so clean and polished. Based on this sort of atmosphere, I thought I had to up the ante and invest in things I always wanted but never had the occasion to wear.”
Wearing a well-tailored blazer—pocket square included—leather shoes, and cropped coal-colored pants, Dai has clearly upped the ante. However, despite a clear individualistic streak in his clothing, he does not believe that his converse—the uniformed style groups of Ivy League, collegiate, and tired—are necessarily negative.
“I think there’s obviously much more important and systemic problems in the world besides whether the girls of Harvard are wearing Longchamp bags and Barbour jackets. And maybe we should talk about whether that should change and ask if it has a WASPy, exclusive feeling that makes people feel like an other. But on the other hand, this is college,” he says. “Harvard style can feel oppressive if you look at it in the wrong way, but I highly doubt that all these people will go off into the world and wear exactly the same thing for years and years.”
LOWERCASE F
For Drummond, fashion is a way to express your heart and soul on your sleeve. For Gao, it is a new world coming over the crest of the horizon. For Pretto, fashion is art—a bottomless well from which you can draw inspiration and use it to coalesce people and the environment they inhabit. For Maybank, fashion comes from history, a complicated process of cutting and deconstructing swaths of fabric to create something new and you. For McGrath, fashion is a way to stand out, to create the person you want to be.  And for Dai, fashion is exploratory, a step that he didn’t even know he would take and yet has drawn craft from.
But fashion is not necessarily so neat as these categorizations. In order to enjoy it, you don’t have to possess an encyclopedic knowledge of fashion trends and figures. As Drummond so aptly puts it, all that’s needed is thoughtful consideration of what is around you. “You don’t even have to pinpoint influences exactly. Look outside, it’s part of you. Just take in what’s around you and impress yourself upon it. It doesn’t have to be about Vogue or what have you. Really, it should be much easier,” Drummond says. “This is not fashion with a capital F.”

"Started From the Bottom"
Drake, "Nothing Was the Same"
Apparently Drake has a new anthem. Before his music career took off and he became our favorite Canadian rap artist, he was living the hard life. Forget about the bankrolls he earned playing Jimmy Brooks on the soap opera “Degrassi: The Next Generation”—according to his latest single, Drake “started from the bottom” like the rest of them. “Argu[ing] every month” with his mama, hitting “traffic on the way home”—Drake’s life was truly a struggle. The song follows Drake’s usual my-crew’s-better-than-yours attitude, delivered through simple rhymes like “We just want the credit where it’s due / I’ma worry bout me, give a fuck about you.” Though the lyrics leave you unconvinced of his tough-life attitude, the easy beat and straightforward lines make it catchy enough to nod along to.
"Gentleman"
Psy
After gaining international success with his 2012 release “Gangnam Style,” Korean pop artist Psy is again looking to top charts with his new single “Gentleman.” The song follows a similar recipe of Psy singing in Korean over a monotonous but energizing electro beat, eventually culminating in a witty English hook. The catchphrase of this track is “I’m a motha-father-gentleman”—but despite being a grammatically incorrect one-liner, it remains appealing because of its broken, rhythmic delivery. Although it is refreshing to hear Psy’s new release, “Gentleman” lacks the novelty expected from the Korean artist. Its structure is a carbon copy of other top electronica hits, and its sound is not as markedly distinct as that of “Gangnam Style.” Though “Gentleman” does not possess the “wow” factor of Psy’s 2012 single, this track employs the right amount of repetitive bass and escalating synthesizer to make it a dance-friendly hit.
"IFHY"
Tyler, the Creator feat. Pharrell
Tyler, the Creator is known for his violent and crass lyrics, but it is clear that he has taken a more emotional and experimental approach in developing the sound of his recent tracks. In his notably gravelly voice, Tyler recites the first verse of “IFHY” over a single organ chord, creating an ominous mood that progresses with the inclusion of drums and jarring, purposefully clumsy horns. The song alternates between passive and aggressively harsh delivery in true Tyler fashion; furthermore, it possesses emotional complexity with lines like “And I’m grieving and my heart starts bleeding.” With a compilation of paradoxical lyrics—“I fucking hate you / But I love you”—Tyler portrays an obsessive interest which is creatively complemented by strident instrumentals. The composition of “IFHY” is elaborate, its slightly abrasive sound an artful reflection of the distorted and complex relationship detailed through Tyler’s lyrics.

Jackie Robinson’s plights and ultimate success are the stuff of legend. Arguably one of the best players to swing a bat, with the only number in baseball history to ever be retired across all of MLB, Robinson comes to life on the silver screen in “42,” directed and written by Brian Helgeland.  Although chock-full of inspired performances by its leads and moments  of real resonance, the film becomes at times too heavy-handed and forced  in its quest to canonize Robinson, preventing the film from becoming a  quintessential part of baseball lore.
 
The film details the first few years of Robinson’s (Chadwick Boseman) career, starting from his time in the Negro leagues. After getting a call from the Brooklyn Dodgers general manager, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Robinson is signed to the team. He first heads to their minor league affiliate, the Montreal Royals,  and then eventually finds himself in the big leagues. There he must  face the charged racial prejudices of the public as well as in the  locker room, breaking the unwritten color barrier of baseball.
 
Helgeland’s  directorial strength lies in his precision and attention to detail.  With the box scores, vintage uniforms, announcers, and the startlingly  accurate rendering of Ebbets Field,  the home stadium of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the film aims to transport  its audience to another time with different sensibilities. Helgeland’s  interpretations of pivotal games are where his eye for the small things  is on full display. The tension and suspense is best developed when the  film does not depend on the dialogue, but rather the slow unraveling of  the action on the field. Each fly ball, walk, and foul ball is taken  into account, and it is not always the home run that serves as the  climax. When Robinson finally arrives at spring camp for the Dodgers, he  resolves to steal three bases. The sequence is one of the more exciting  ones, although the event is mundane and small relative to the film’s  larger plot. 
 
It  is when Helgeland steps away from the baseball field that the film  teeters on an overly sentimental and saccharine script that simplifies  its characters and relationships to a fault. “You are a hero,” Robinson  is told. He responds, “I am just a ball player.” Robinson is seen as the  model man, and his only vice, a short temper, is heard and not actually  seen except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. While the  film’s aim is to mythologize Robinson, simplifying him to purely the  beacon between white and black relations does a disservice to a man who  was much more multi-faceted. Many of the team members are  indistinguishable, and Robinson’s relationships with those around him,  including his wife (Nicole Beharie), seem overly idealistic, contributing to the at-times after-school-special feel of the film.
 
Boseman  primarily masks the faults of the script, playing Robinson with a quiet  strength and resilience. The film’s Robinson does not seek to be the  champion of black rights, but he is thrust into the role, coming  straight into the line of fire of those who think that he has no right  to play on the same field as the white man. Boseman is able to invoke  Robinson’s frustration and restraint to powerful results. The best  example of this comes after Robinson is verbally abused by the  Philadelphia manager. Robinson heads back to the walkthrough to vent his  anger. Boseman’s ferocity as he breaks the bat as well as his emotional  collapse bring a needed desperation that was missing from the film’s  glossy exterior.
 
The  biggest revelation of the film, though, is Ford, who portrays the  Bible-thumping, money-conscious Rickey. Hardly recognizable in his prosthetics and always holding a cigar, Ford’s Rickey is humorous and gruff,  serving as the perfect ancillary point to Boseman’s Robinson. Rickey is  the conscience and grounding factor as well as a man with a mission.  Ford creates an endearing figure in Rickey by portraying him with a  gusto and sensitivity and switching quickly between conviction and  uncertainty.
 
The film is ultimately more “The Blind Side” than “Moneyball,”  old-fashioned in its sentimentalities and simple in its mission. While  there is nothing wrong with this, there is a sense that with such a rich  history from which to draw, a much more complicated, complete film  could have been made. In the end, Helgeland’s “42,” although one-noted,  is an inoffensive excursion into one of baseball’s greatest stories that  is truly inspirational even in this time and age.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tragedy struck Monday afternoon when two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 170.
All of our gut reactions to the marathon bombings must inevitably be a mixture of confusion, fear, and anger.  Confusion because the nation has yet to learn who is responsible for what President Obama Monday called an “act of terrorism” and because it is impossible to fathom what would motivate such a hateful act. Fear because we cannot rule out the possibility that this type of violence could happen again when we are least expecting it.  And anger because we cannot stomach the senseless slaughter of innocents, including an eight-year-old child.
Americans are right to be confused, afraid, and angry, and we are right to want to identify those behind the bombings and bring them to justice.  We must not, however, lose sight of the ways in which Monday’s evil brought out the good in so many.
Onlookers at the Boston Marathon rushed not away from the carnage but toward it to help the fallen. Marathon participants continued running past the finish line to Massachusetts General Hospital, where they donated blood to those wounded. Boston residents opened their homes to runners and victims’ family members who had no place to stay after the chaos. Google launched a person finder to aid people in locating their loved ones, and The Crimson compiled a list of names of Harvard affiliates confirmed safe.
Tuesday night, members of the Harvard community gathered in a candlelight vigil to mourn, reflect, and offer each other support. This, along with the overwhelming kindness displayed in response to Monday’s attacks, shows that people across the Harvard campus and across the United States at large understand the need to come together and lean on each other in troubling times. Amid daily academic competition at school and partisan bickering nationwide, it is too often that we lose sight of this imperative to understand and care for each other, regardless of our differences.
When tragedy strikes, we almost lose ourselves in horror and grief. Our faith in the world suffers a near-shattering blow. But when tragedy strikes, we also strike back. We straighten up, square our shoulders, and set out to counter the awful with the positive.  We meet hurt and despair with help and hope.
Monday’s events showcased the worst side of humanity, and yet they also showcased the best. Every year at the Boston Marathon, men and women run 26.2 miles, sweat dripping down their faces, pain shooting through their chests, their bodies overcoming whatever physical pain and mental doubts threaten to hold them back—whether it takes them two hours and three minutes to reach the finish line, or four hours and nine.
Like these indomitable athletes, we, too, will overcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine your favorite picture: a cherished memory, a cool shot from the internet, or even just a photo with best friends. Each person’s response to a photograph is a personal reflection on a memory that happens to be captured in an image. In the past, these pictures stayed in one frame, one house, destined to be passed down and cherished, or thrown away and forgotten. With the advent of camera phones and the internet, not only can images be preserved on the go, but they also can instantly be uploaded to social media, transforming a personal experience into a group activity. Over the past few years, these mobile photography labs have proven to be invaluable assets to society. However, the recent increase in social sharing of shots has diluted the impact of this photography. Rather than serving as a means of commemoration and celebration, photography has become a mundane means of communication.
As the number of phones in the world creeps toward the world population, easy access to camera phones allows for quick transfer of information. In New York City, police officers encourage citizens to photograph or film crimes from their phones to aid in the pursuit of justice. Recently, revolutionaries have used camera phones to photograph and tape their actions, acting as photojournalists in countries such as Syria. Many historical events have been captured on camera phones and spread on YouTube, including Saddam Hussein’s execution. Even as recently as this week, ordinary citizens snapped images of the Boston Marathon tragedy and spread them online as the situation developed. Although these images vary in source, they share the common purpose of distributing information beneficial to society.
Initially, cameras phones were neither revolutionary nor historical; many people simply used them as a method to construct a set of personal memories. See a cool picture, snap a shot, and keep it in the memory banks as a keepsake. Taken alone, these cellular photos minimize the need to carry a clunky camera around just for that one fleeting photograph: Now memory preservation is at your fingertips. With the advent of photo sharing, what were once personal celebrations have transformed into a collective view of reality. A portion of Instagram’s popularity may be due to the nifty effects and the ability to mimic an expensive dollar camera with a free application. However, this transformation from mediocre to monumental is only part of the equation: The ability to instantly update the world about your new Volkswagen Jetta is a casual and convenient way of staying connected.
Although the notion of staying connected through images is a novel idea, these social networks have spread uncontrollably, as image sharing increasingly displaces textual exchanges and actual conversations. While many people use Instagram as a cheap photographic substitute, some use it to document their every move in a never-ending onslaught of monotonous memories. The introduction of Snapchat initially provided a medium for funny photographic exchanges between friends; now it seems that some people hold whole conversations via picture, relying on images rather than putting the effort into constructing their own words. The increased focus on images in a social context rather than personal affections should lead to concern for both photographic enthusiasts who value their art and the average citizen who values conversation.
The spread of imagery through social media, while slightly disturbing in its current state, could further marginalize interactions and flood our news feeds in the future. Whereas social media currently encourages people to share their personal photos with the world, this act is not only left up to the discretion of the user, but also depends on an ability to photograph in the moment. Memento, a Swedish start-up, intends to minimize the effort required to pick and choose memorable moments by developing a wearable camera that automatically takes pictures every thirty seconds. If successful, not only will this technology result in even more inconsequential and meaningless social uploads of personal memories, but more importantly, it will also continue to degrade the art of photography. As quick, instantaneous pictures become a larger part of social interactions, planned pieces of art decrease in value, and the average person becomes conditioned to a poor, constant stream of pictures rather than a few fantastic memories. If the need for instant connection continues to spread via social photography, unforeseen consequences will impact the photographic profession.
Whether at a concert, a zoo, or just a walk through the park, camera flashes sparkle through society at an ever-increasing rate. As the proportion of pictures increases exponentially, the significance of these memories decreases. Now for every historical and revolutionary moment, the world welcomes thirty out-of-focus and drunken quasi-memories into the photographic community. Just as poor quality photos increasingly dominate the world of social media, cameras permeate everyday interactions to keep pace with the demand for constant, rather than consistent connections.
Every time a camera flashes, a new picture is born, ready to be treasured and valued. But our eyes increasingly marvel at the flash rather than appreciate the darkness between memories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Monday, an explosion at the finish line of the Boston Marathon wounded dozens and killed three. The race, a quintessentially Bostonian tradition that brings joys to the city and many in the Harvard community, became a tragedy that was heard around the world.
As my high school friends began inquiring about my safety, I had a novel realization that I was a proud Bostonian. I have lived in the city for almost three years. I’ve savored the food, cheered for the teams, and complained about the weather. But it took a tragedy for me to become fully conscious of my identity as a Bostonian.
I feel solidarity with the complete strangers at the Marathon. In response to tragedies, people find a powerful force that joins them together. Perhaps it’s the juxtaposition of the vulnerability and value of a human life. Or perhaps, the overwhelmingly resonant emotions trump any individual differences. I felt the anger and helplessness of the peace-loving people who ran for charity. I worried about my friends who ran, like numerous other families whose loved ones were in the hospital or could not be contacted. I felt, like many Bostonian blood donors did in the past two days, an urge to help.
Experiencing these emotions, I couldn’t help but think about other tragedies on the scale of the Marathon bombing occurring daily around the world. I cannot find coherent moral reasons to care about strangers in Boston, but not strangers in Iraq. On the same day as the Marathon bombing, coordinated terrorist attacks in Iraq killed at least 55. In the last decade, more than 68,000 lives have perished in terrorist attacks, of whom most are civilians. It’s easy for bombings in remote parts of the world to become mere statistics, but the Boston tragedy is a visual reminder of the experiences of those whose daily lives are full of terror.
Even if we bring justice to the perpetrator(s) in the Marathon bombings, it will be nearly impossible to prevent such rare events at home. We can, however, make an impact in other countries heavily inflicted with domestic terrorism. According to a study of global terrorism by the Institute for Economics and Peace, there are certain values and institutions that are historically correlated with domestic peace.
Countries with persistent “group grievances” have higher levels of domestic terrorism. Globally, religious and nationalist institutions that preach hatred for other groups create never-ending mutual animosity. The eye-for-an-eye mentality makes each group both the perpetrator and the victim. As globalization and human migration force us to live with others who do not look the same or eat the same food, maintaining an equal, united environment that minimizes inter-group tention will be a challenge for governments and communities for years to come.
We can also find roots of terrorism in authoritarian governments that do not respond to the discontent of their citizens. In South Asia, an area with increasing incidences of domestic terrorism, the lack of equal opportunities and corrupt governance have led to militant communist uprisings that terrorize existing institutions. Their violence perpetuates the cycle of poverty and poor governance. In these regions, replacing poor political institutions is at the heart of the defeating terrorism.
To commemorate the recent tragedy, we should perhaps take a look at the first time Boston’s blast was heard around the world. On April 19, 1775, the Patriots in Boston fired the first shots of the American Revolution against a British tyranny. In the years to come, the revolution grew from the Patriots’ love for equality and freedom from oppression.  These values, ratified by the Constitution as institutions, ensured American prosperity and domestic peace for most of its splendid history.
The legacies of the Patriots do not only live in our Constitution or on the Freedom Trail. As the Patriots’ worldly values grew out of the Georgian townhouses of Lexington and spread around the world, they are also quietly preserved in this city’s inhabitants, passed down through centuries of local communities and institutions. In the aftermath of the Marathon bombings, the face of local heroism was Carlos Arredondo, a Costa Rican peace activist who not until recently became an American citizen and Bostonian. His example shows that new Bostonians like myself (and many others at Harvard) are part of a community based on equality and freedom rather than religion or skin color, which make us more resilient in times of terror.
The Boston Marathon on Patriots' Day is usually proclaimed as a proud remembrance to the local militiamen’s valor and strength, but Monday's tragedy should also serve as a reminder of the Boston Patriots’ values: freedom and equality. These values, not drones, will help eradicate terrorism around the globe. These values will help those facing tragedies to overcome adversity. I hope that the next time Boston is heard around the world, it will be for the chants of freedom and equality, and not for the detonation of violence.

Harvard will pay $1,500 to University employees who have extended health insurance coverage to their same-sex spouses under the University family medical plan in an attempt to compensate for additional taxes that these employees must pay that their heterosexual colleagues do not.
The announcement of the “tax equalization payment” came on April 15, also known as Tax Day, and will become effective this month.
Rita Moore, the director of benefits and human resources systems for Harvard Human Resources, told the Gazette that the new policy is designed to ensure that health benefits comply with the University’s nondiscrimination policy.
“The unequal tax treatment of health benefits under federal law has been troubling to many LGBT employees at Harvard as a matter of equity with other families,” Moore said.
She added that the new policy is consistent with similar moves by other major employers, such as the city of Cambridge.
Charles J. Curti, director of human resources at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, told the Gazette that the University has been contemplating the policy change since last August.
The discrepancy in tax payments between same-sex and heterosexual spouses stems from the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which dictates that the federal government would not recognize same-sex marriages or unions.
In addition to married couples within Massachusetts and the other eight states that recognize same-sex marriage, employees in same-sex domestic partnerships who do not reside in those parts of the country may also receive the payment.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn dela Pena, who oversees BGLTQ student life, told The Crimson in an email that she was not surprised by the University’s announcement, given Harvard’s other “inclusive policies and practices” intended to “affirm its diverse community.”
“There are many ways Harvard treats its LGBT employees with dignity and respect, from offering benefits for same-sex domestic partners to covering top and bottom surgery for transgender employees,” she said.
Additionally, following the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2004, Harvard chose to continue to provide health benefits for cohabiting same-sex couples, while many other employers declined to do so.
Arthur Patton-Hock, the administrative director of both the American Civilization/American Studies Program and the Charles Warren Center who has worked at Harvard for more than 25 years, told the Gazette that he appreciated the message that Harvard valued his husband and two sons as much as other employees and their families.
“Harvard’s been a wonderful employer to me,” Patton-Hock said. “It’s only at the moment of benefits-election time or tax-preparation time that the inequity rankles.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A day after students criticized the University for how it communicated with undergraduates in the hours following two bomb explosions at the Boston Marathon Monday afternoon, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds told students in an email that Harvard “can and will do better to communicate with our community in times of crisis.”
Though the two bombs detonated at approximately 2:50 p.m. Monday, College students did not receive official word from the University about the incident until 5:17 p.m.
Students questioned the University’s decision not to alert undergraduates to the crisis earlier, through either email or the University-wide notifcation service MessageMe.
In her email Tuesday afternoon, Hammonds acknowledged some of those complaints.
“Some students have raised questions about the timeliness of the College’s notification of students,” the email reads.
Hammonds wrote that Harvard’s priority was to work with the Harvard University Police Department “to ensure that there was no security threat to the College campus” and to find and support Harvard affiliates involved in the incident, adding that the College “actively” reached out to House administrators and University Health Services on Monday.
She also wrote that “yesterday’s events were extremely fluid and it took time to sort fact from rumor” before saying that Harvard could improve its communication at times of crisis.
Hammonds’s email also thanked members of the Harvard community who “rallied to help those in need” in wake of the bombings Monday and reminded students of University mental health resources. She also encouraged students to attend the Undergraduate Council’s vigil at Memorial Church Tuesday night.

Just as it seemed all members of the Harvard community who ran or attended the Boston Marathon were safely accounted for after the fatal bombing, FBI officials said Monday that Krystle Campbell, a former Harvard Business School employee whose mother and brother still work at the University, was among three killed in the attacks.
Krystle, 29, was near the Boylston Street finish line with a friend waiting to snap a picture of her friend’s boyfriend when the first of two explosions shook the marathon course at 2:50 p.m. Twelve seconds later and a little less than 100 yards away, a second bomb detonated. Krystle sustained serious injuries in the explosions and was rushed by medics to Massachusetts General Hospital, where she died, her father William A. Campbell Jr. told the Associated Press Tuesday.
The two explosions ultimately injured more than 170 and killed three, including 8-year-old Martin Richard, Campbell, and a yet unnamed Boston University student.
Krystle’s mother, Patricia Campbell, has worked as a cashier and server at HBS for more than 30 years. Krystle’s brother, William A. Campbell III, works in the Cabot House dining hall.
Krystle herself worked weekends as a cashier at HBS’ Spangler Grille while attending the University of Massachusetts-Boston, former co-workers and friends of the family said Tuesday. Most recently, Krystle worked at Jimmy’s Steer House in Arlington.
Former co-workers and friends at HBS remembered Krystle as a free-spirited woman who especially loved her grandmother, Lillian Campbell. The two lived together and Krystle had been taking care of her grandmother before her death.
“She was a very independent girl and she put herself through four years of college and never asked her parents for any money,” said Jean Adams, a member of the HBS dining staff for 34 years who said she grew up with Patricia Campbell. “[She was] a good kid, a really good kid. She never smoked, she never drank, she was always focused on education.”
The news of Krystle’s death reached Harvard early Tuesday morning when the family contacted some of Patricia’s co-workers at HBS.
“When I walked into the kitchen at 9 o’clock this morning, people were sobbing,” Adams said. “Grown men [were] crying, they were just devastated.”
Administrators, who had already cancelled classes for the day before hearing of Campbell’s death, hastened to organize a community gathering to express condolences for the family. Roughly 200 students, faculty, and staff gathered at the steps of HBS’s Baker Library at 3 p.m. Under flags flying at half mast, the group shared a moment of silence and prayer led by the Rev. George S. Salzmann, a Harvard chaplain, before hearing remarks from HBS Dean Nitin Nohria and other administrators.
“As difficult as these moments are—and this is truly a difficult time for all of us in this community­—these are also the times that remind us how much we rely upon each other, how much we lean on each other, how much this also brings out in us our very best,” Nohria told the crowd. “We will do everything we can to help one of our own through these difficult times.”
The gathering was preceded by a 30-minute musical selection performed by three MBA students, followed by a reception in Spangler Lounge, where community members wrote cards to the Campbell family.
Aman Kumar, a first-year MBA student present at the gathering, said that the moment of reflection and solidarity was important for the HBS community, which usually prides itself on rigor and intensity.
“Part of showing leadership is knowing when to pause, and that’s what this was... to take a moment to realize that life is fragile.” Kumar said. “Critics of this place like pretending that we think we know everything, that we are invincible, but we’re not.”
Samantha DeOliveira, who works with Executive Education in coordination and whose son graduated from Medford High School with Krystle, said that the outpouring of community support at Harvard ensures that none of its members are alone in times of tragedy.
“This community is always there, no matter what happens to the littlest person or the highest person,” DeOliveira said. “There’s been a lot of sad times, and we’ve all stood together, and this is what I love about being at Harvard, this is why I’m still here.”
Remembrance of Campbell was not limited to HBS. Community members at Cabot House, where Krystle’s brother works, held a moment of silence at 6 p.m. and wrote cards for the Campbell family in the dining hall.
“The dining hall staff is part of this family at the House,” Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana said. “Billy is someone that is loved by all the students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a hundred students and community members packed Geological Lecture Hall Tuesday evening to listen to a conversation between psychology professors Steven Pinker and Howard E. Gardner ’65.
The event, presented by the Mind/Brain/Behavior Graduate School Committee, was designed as a natural conversation between the two professors, giving students a chance to see them in a different environment than in a traditional lecture.
“It was good to see them play off each other. Perhaps it was less exciting than other talks because there was less room for disagreement between them,” said attendee Sarah E. Coughlon ’15.
Gardner said that the inspiration for this event was for students to get a peak into the conversations that professors have behind closed doors.
Pinker and Gardner questioned each other on a variety of topics, ranging from their literary works to their inspiration in education and psychology to the methods they use and research.
“What’s most surprising to you about your own career?” Gardner asked Pinker.
“I consume topics and move on to other ones. I say what I had to say, and then I’m done,” Pinker said.
Much of the event consisted of reminiscing by the two professors. They recalled their time as graduate students in psychology and having to spend countless hours in the laboratory or pouring over case studies.
“We did pay our dues earlier on,” Gardner said.
At the end of the conversation, Gardner and Pinker answered questions from the attendees. One audience member asked how technological advances would lead to robots and computers replacing humans in the labor market.
“I start every introductory psychology class with a lecture that discusses all the things computers cannot do. I have had to modify that lecture every year,” Pinker said.
In the midst of Advising Fortnight, several students attended the event to gain insight into the Mind, Brain, and Behavior field of study.
“I came to get a sense of what [MBB] is and what these great men had to say because they are obviously big names,” Jasmine A. Fernandez ’16 said.

The day after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring at least 176 to date, government officials and investigators revealed a preliminary theory about the nature of the explosives used and the way in which they may have been transported.
Richard DesLauriers, the FBI agent in charge of the investigation, said that it appeared that kitchen-type “pressure-cookers” were probably the devices used in the attack, and that they probably had been modified to release various types of shrapnel upon explosion. Investigators found pieces of shrapnel, in the form of “fragments of BB’s and nails”, in the blast zone.
In addition to the shrapnel, DesLauriers devoted particular attention to a few shreds of fabric recovered near the finish area.
“Among items partially recovered are pieces of black nylon which could be from a backpack,” DesLauriers said, adding that investigators concluded Tuesday morning that “both of the explosives were placed in a dark-colored nylon bag or backpack. The bag would have been heavy due to the components believed to be in it.”
Though he cautioned that the evidence has not yet been examined by the FBI’s lab in Quantico, VA., DesLauriers asked civilians to try and recall if they had seen somebody carrying “an usually heavy, dark-colored bag around the time of the blast and in the vicinity of the blast.”
While DesLauriers said that the FBI had received over 2,000 tips by noon on Tuesday, he admitted that “the range of suspects and motives remains wide open.”
Boston area officials also fielded questions about the preparedness of the Boston Police Department.
Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis said that his department had identified the finish area as a risk zone before the race, and had developed a security plan to account for that.
“There were more officers assigned to this race than we had ever assigned before,” he said. “We were particularly concerned with the finish line this year and assigned more officers down in that area. I think if you look at the videotapes you can see that.”
He also pointed to the difficulties of securing such a public event.
“[The marathon] is a soft target,” Davis said. “When you have an event like this, you can’t lock it down like a military operation. It needs to be open to the public.”
Davis also said that the finish area had been swept for explosives on two occasions—both hours before the explosions—Monday morning by an explosive ordinance disposal unit. Neither he nor DesLauriers would comment on whether the explosives used might have been undetectable by bomb-sniffing dogs.
Throughout Tuesday, law enforcement officials that stressed that the public may hold the key to the investigation. “We are hoping that if there is any video or graphic evidence that you will please contact the FBI hotline or the city’s hotline,” said Gene Marquez, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
“You might not think it’s significant, but it might have some value to this investigation,” concurred Col. Timothy Alben of the Massachusetts State Police.
The developments in the FBI-led investigation into the bombings came after an unusual day in Back Bay. Much of the neighborhood remained off-limits to the public, causing delays for public transportation and forcing drivers to take alternative routes.
Reporters crowded the accessible areas near the crime scene. One restaurant on Newbury Street—Stephanie’s on Newbury—attracted a multitude of cameramen straining to capture photographs of a patio of dirty tables with plates full of half-consumed meals, untouched since Monday afternoon, when restaurant patrons and staffers fled the bombs.
Even the streets that weren’t barricaded—and which would usually be busy during the Tuesday morning commute—were largely deserted, with the exception of the media. Scores of television relay trucks clustered around Boston Common, and also congregated on Commonwealth Avenue between Dartmouth and Exeter Streets.
By Tuesday evening, the names of two of the three victims who have died so far as a result of the explosions had been released. Martin Richard, 8, from Dorchester was watching his father, William Richard, finish the race when the bombs blew; his sister and mother are still recovering from serious injuries, though his brother was unharmed in the blast. Krystle Campbell, 29, a former Harvard employee and relative of two Harvard University staff members, was described by family members as a loyal fan of the marathon.
The third victim has not yet been identified, though she is believed to have been a Chinese national.
Another media briefing is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. President Barack Obama will visit Boston on Thursday morning and will attend an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

On both sides of the Charles River, they gathered.
Some Harvard community members came to the Kennedy School courtyard, joining hands and trading stories at an afternoon vigil. Others assembled in Boston Common, signing posters and laying down flowers beneath the setting sun. Still others congregated around the steps of Memorial Church in Tercentenary Theater, lighting candles and embracing in spite of a strong evening wind.
All of them came to mourn—to grieve, to reflect, to try to make sense of the bombing that on Monday transformed the triumphant 26th mile of the Boston Marathon into a grisly scene of death and chaos.
SHOWING SUPPORT AT THE KENNEDY SCHOOL
A day after explosions at the Boston Marathon and a fire at the JFK Presidential Library prompted a total evacuation of the Harvard Kennedy School, affiliates gathered in the campus courtyard on Tuesday afternoon to participate in a vigil honoring the attacks’ victims and first responders.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, who invited students, staff, and faculty to the event via an email Tuesday morning, told attendees that “we’re here first and foremost as a show of support.”
After the crowd gathered, Ellwood asked everyone to join hands for a moment of silence.
Once the vigil concluded, some attendees slowly returned to the classrooms for regular events, but many remained outdoors to continue discussion.
Monday’s attack coincided with the Kennedy School’s annual Public Service Week, which features community volunteer projects.
Kennedy School student Cindy Dinh, who attended the vigil, said that this gathering offers a chance for students to reflect on the event further and determine how they can best impact the Boston community.
“It was nice to have the Kennedy School come together for this moment,” Dinh said, “especially since it’s a school of public service and everyone wants to spring into action.”
As spectators near the finish line, two Kennedy School students had already sprung into action. When the bombs went off, these students rushed into the mayhem to assist injured spectators and runners, said Kennedy School spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson.
She added that these individuals chose to remain anonymous.
Several Kennedy School students competed in the marathon, including one who was wearing the event’s trademark blue and yellow jersey at the vigil.
The participant, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he was less than a quarter of a mile away from the finish line when the bombs went off and believed at the time that his wife was waiting for him there. He later learned that she had not yet arrived.
While addressing those at the vigil, Ellwood said that the Kennedy School was offering more opportunities for those who wished to talk about Monday’s bombings.
Jackson said that the Belfer Center’s Weil Town Hall had been commissioned as a space for those who wished to talk and reflect about Monday’s attack.
FINDING STRENGTH IN BOSTON COMMON
In the aftermath of the explosions at the Boston Marathon, runners, spectators, victims, and other community members gathered for a vigil in Boston Common on Tuesday afternoon.
Hundreds of people congregated around the rotunda in the Common to sign large banners that read, “Peace Here and Everywhere” and “Boston, You Are Our Home.” Attendees of all ages signed the banners, with some leaving flowers and other gifts.
As he dropped a rose on the banner, one young boy looked up and spoke to a host of shuttering cameras: “This is for peace.”
Participants said that the vigil was a display of Boston’s remarkable strength.
“I came to support the greater Boston community,” said Tony Messina, a student at Northeastern who said that he knew a few friends who attended the race and left unharmed. “Partly, I came to show that we’re not afraid [to congregate] in groups, even after everything that happened yesterday. I think it’s important to show that attacks like this won’t change us.”
Notes written on the banners also referenced the city’s fortitude; many carried the Twitter hashtag, #BostonStrong.
“Hate can never drive out hate. Only love can,” read another entry, quoting a biblical verse.
Several hundred people attended the event, with the music provided by an impromptu collection of musicians organized via Facebook.
“I’m just a local singer, and I was up all night last night and all this morning, just watching coverage and knowing that there is nothing that I can personally do. It was really hard,” said the group’s organizer, Boston musician Lori L’italien. “So I just made a Facebook group and invited everybody I knew that was a singer and we got an astounding number of people.”
Within hours, L’Italien said that over 2,000 people had joined the group’s page and expressed interest in singing at some point to express their emotion about the event.
Speaking about the group’s repertoire, which included Amazing Grace, the Star Spangled Banner, an arrangement of O Magnum Mysterium, and the Christian hymn On Eagles Wings, L’Italien said that the group had taken suggestions and generally looked for “songs that everybody knew, uplifting songs.”
FOCUSING ON GOODNESS AT MEMORIAL CHURCH
Community members gathered outside of Memorial Church on Tuesday evening to hold a candlelight vigil for victims of the Boston Marathon explosions. University President Drew G. Faust and other speakers at the vigil echoed each other in their acknowledgment of human goodness in light of the attack.
Students donning bright blue jackets that signified them as participants in this year’s marathon were among a crowd of hundreds of children, faculty, and community members.
Before the speakers began, Undergraduate Council members circulated through the crowd and distributed long white candles. Attendees leaned in towards each other to light their candles, shielding them from the strong wind that caused many candles to go out throughout the event.
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 spoke first, expressing the Harvard student body’s empathy for the Boston community.
“We are very tied to this community regardless of where home is for us,” she said.
Raghuveer introduced Faust, who delivered remarks that emphasized the importance of staying together as a community.
She quoted writer Toni Morrison, who said, “We tend to overlook goodness,” but that “we must put goodness front and center in our lives.”
Anqi Peng ’14, who ran in the marathon on Monday, echoed Faust’s advice to focus on the good. Peng spoke about witnessing numerous examples of human kindness after the attack, such as restaurant owners giving food and housing to runners.
“I’m not even going to try to make sense of what happened yesterday,” Peng said.
Peng repeated her admiration of the perseverance and strength of everyone there, which she acknowledged as her favorite part about running marathons.
After witnessing and reflecting on the community support following Monday’s attack, Peng said, “I’m going to smile at everyone walking down the street.”
Three Harvard chaplains of different denominations spoke, emphasizing that the event was interfaith and community members of all beliefs were welcome to Memorial Church. The chaplains called for everyone to come together, comparing individual attendees to individual candles, but who together made a “great illumination.” They followed their speeches with a moment of silence.
The Rev. Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, closed the vigil, emphasizing the importance of showing love.
Following Walton’s words, attendees gave each other hugs and wished each other well as they dispersed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an afternoon of running, jumping and throwing, the trophies would remain in Cambridge – Cambridge, MA that is.
In the 44th meeting of the Harvard-Yale combined track team against Oxford-Cambridge, the Americans proved dominant winning 27-11 on Tuesday at the McCurdy Outdoor Track. The meet, which is held biennially in a rotating venue, is the world’s oldest continuous international amateur athletic competition and awards points based solely on the first place winner of each event.
Crimson athletes, just a matter of days after besting the Bulldogs in New Haven, joined forces with their Ancient Eight rivals, even competing on combined relay teams.
“Teaming up with Yale is an interesting experience because our entire Harvard work ethic is about this rivalry and how we’re supposed to do whatever we can to beat them,” senior Fedor Garin said. “Now we’re alongside them which is fun because it makes us realize that even though we’re pitted against them, we’re pretty much the same people.”
The American men, who bested the Brits 13-6, found particular strength in the field events. The jumpers leapt to the podium in every event while the throwers captured all but one, the javelin throw.
Yale senior Michael Levine set the mark in the hammer and discus throw with marks of 56.47 and 51.59 meters, respectively. In the shot put, Harvard went 1-2-3- with sophomore Igor Liokumovich taking the top spot with a 17.56 meter throw, tailed by teammates junior Dustin Brode and sophomore Ben Glauser. Liokumovich was the second place finisher in the discus.
A trio of Crimson jumpers, Garin and fellow senior Nico Weiler, along with sophomore Malcolm Mason-Rodriguez, swept the jumping events. Mason-Rodriguez topped the field in the long and triple jump while Weiler, who owns the school record in the pole vault, won his signature event by nearly half a meter and Garin averaged two meters to win the high jump.
“Everyone has been after it for a while especially because we remember our trip two years ago to England,” Garin said. “I had a very good meet. I didn’t PR but I was pretty close to it. I really enjoyed the company of the jumpers from Oxford and Cambridge.”
The competitors on the track found a tougher time from the nation that produced Roger Bannister, as Oxford-Cambridge runners were able to win five of the 11 races.
Sophomore Connor McCarthy, who won the 100 and 200-meter events this weekend at Yale, broke the 200-meter meet record held since 1965 with a time of 21.10 seconds. Harvard sprinters brought home the points in the 100-meter dash and 110-meter hurdles, with wins from junior Damani Wilson and sophomore Jarvis Harris. Senior Jakob Lindaas outpaced his competitor from the other Cambirdge, Tom Watkins, by just one second in the 3000-meter steeplechase.
The women made quick work of their Oxford-Cambridge foes, disposing of them 14-5. Junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, vanquished the previous meet record in the hammer throw by over three meters. Her 55.81 meters is also a new personal best.
Senior Shannon Watt won both the discus and the shot put and teammate Mary Hirst won the javelin with a throw of 38.08 meters, a mark almost seven meters ahead of the second place competitor, Yale’s Megan Toon.
More records were extinguished in the 200-meter dash. While Nadine Prill of Oxford won the event in 24.64 seconds, Harvard sophomore Gabrielle Scott’s time of 24.68 also set her below the preview meet record of 24.82 seconds.
Speed continued to be on Harvard’s side as the Crimson also prevailed in the 100-meter hurdles, 100-meter dash and 400-meter run. A joint Harvard-Yale team scampered to a winning time of 47.30 seconds in the 4x100 relay, holding nearly three seconds on the British sprinters. The Bulldogs provided wins in distance events, capturing the 3000-meter steeplechase, 1500-meter run and 5000-meter run.
The meet has a history stretching back to 1899, when Cantabs and Elis traveled across the pond to compete against their British peers. The combined Harvard-Yale team has now won five straight meets.
“It’s a big honor to be part of such an incredibly historical event,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “This predates the Modern Olympics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the lights and rain, the two teams battled for each point. There was blood, definitely sweat, and even a ripped jersey or two. Players were jumping and sprinting and fighting back any exhaustion that may have started to creep up in the nearly two-hour long game. The sidelines were roaring with each dodge and dive, and the occasional layout catch through the end-zone.
This was not a football game. Nor was it rugby. This was ultimate frisbee, and to most first-time watchers, the electric atmosphere of these games and the intensity on the field may come as a surprise.
For most students at Harvard, it may also be a surprise to learn that there is a team on campus, the nationally ranked Harvard Red Line.
The scene described above was that from the scrimmage last Wednesday night, when Harvard hosted the new professional team, the Boston Whitecaps. The latter is a member of the new Major League Ultimate (MLU), which has its inaugural season starting up this Saturday. Being very competitive, and conveniently local, the Red Line were open to host the pros in what would be their first exposure to game play since their franchise was born
After the worst of the storm passed through, the captains met in the middle. The first “pull” (similar to a kick-off in football) was determined by a coin flip and the teams took their start at each respective end line. With the throw, the action immediately commenced.
“It is a lot like seven on seven football,” said senior Misha Herscu, one of the captains for the Red Line. “Except that everyone is a wide receiver and a quarterback.”
The game was neck-and-neck. Points were shared, going back and forth until finally the Whitecaps pulled ahead to make it 8-6, and didn’t look back. A highlight of the game, which showed just one aspect of the incredible skill that this sport entails, came when a member of the visiting team dove through the end zone for an impressive, “layout” catch. The crowd went wild. After the time for three quarters ran out, the final score was 14-10, Boston.
“Whenever someone who hasn’t seen ultimate before watches a high level college or club team playing, they are always surprised by the speed and general high level of athleticism,” Herscu said. “It is an extremely exciting sport to watch.”
For a first time visitor to an Ultimate game, there is a lot to learn.  Teams will often have cheers that they perform from their sidelines as a tradition of the game. Additionally, the referee system involves observers to step in when the players cannot make the honest call themselves. This reflects the unique nature of the sport, which highlights the integrity that is upheld on the field.  Competitive ultimate is a new phenomenon, and Harvard is ahead of the game.
Starting in the 70s, the Red Line has grown to national acclaim, currently on the road to the final tournament, sitting as No. 12 in USA Ultimate Rankings. The 24 , crimson-clad players are led by coach Michael MacKenzie, and have upset top-ranked teams like Tufts, Arizona and Michigan this season.
The dream to start a new professional league came from a club team owner in Philadelphia, Jeff Snader. As the founder of MLU, he pulled together enough interest to get two divisions and one league for professional Ultimate.
“Those of us who gathered together to start this league know that ultimate is played by too many amazing athletes, features too many dramatic moments and produces too many incredible highlights to find itself on the sideline of spectator sports,” according to its website.
Jeff Graham is the captain for Boston Whitecaps and former coach for the Harvard Red Line. He started playing Ultimate his senior year in high school, when a few friends who just finished their first year in college showed him the popular, new sport that was spreading on their respective campuses.
After four competitive years of Ultimate at UMass Amherst, Graham went on to start a high school program with a friend in Hillsboro, ME, before coaching at Harvard. He returned the favor of spreading the sport to younger ages, as it was given to him, years later.
After dabbling in the amateur club level and devoting his weekends in the summer to tournaments, the opportunity for professionalism presented itself.
“Since I have been around for so long, [I] was trying to figure out in another construct if it [were] worth all the time and money to be dedicating to ultimate, but this professional activity was something that was new and exciting,” he said. “And it fit into my lifestyle, so I’m excited to be a part of it.”
The MLU front offices provide all the logistical work that Graham and other players once had to do themselves when they played at the club level. Players on the Whitecaps practice a few nights a week and receive a small stipend for their games.
“We’re not kidding ourselves, we aren’t the NFL,” he adds. “Some of the players on the team put in 40, 50, maybe 60 hours a week [to their careers], and then play professional Ultimate on the side.”
Despite now being a professional sport, the teams and players know that there is not a large preexisting fan base. Reaching down to youth Ultimate will be a major focus of the new Boston Franchise.
“There is a lot of action within the sport, and the people who started it were just looking for the best way to capture it,” he said. “How to make it marketable, make it thrill and get it out to more people. We are reaching out in sort of a grassroots effort to a lot to local high school teams, and local leagues that have been around here to make sure we make our team known to the ultimate community which is strong in not just the Boston area, but MA and New England as well.”
One high school that doesn’t need much outreach about ultimate is Amherst Regional High School, in Amherst, MA.
In 1989, English teacher Tiina Booth, gathered a couple students who lingered after class and she simply asked them if they wanted to play Frisbee. The rest is history.
Booth’s group of students soon evolved one of the best teams in the nation. Her creation of the Amherst Invitational Tournament in 1992, the oldest and largest high school ultimate tournament to date, brought the sport to a national level for high school students.
Booth was Herscu’s coach at ARHS, and she also has a former player on the Whitecaps.
“In the past six months, I’ve see more growth and more interesting operations taking hold than I’ve ever seen before,” Booth said. “There are new companies making gear, professional leagues forming, and two new online ultimate magazines just last year. It seems like it is just getting some kind of critical mass that I have not felt ever before."
Much of this growth is due to her efforts in raising youth participation in the sport. With a partner, she transformed her daily Ultimate camps in Amherst into the first national over-night camp for Ultimate, which now is serving students who come from overseas
“I think about ultimate a lot and how we can make it bigger and better,” she added. “And by bigger I don’t mean having all these bells and whistles, but bigger in having Frisbee in every kid’s hand who wants it.
Other efforts have come from a Harvard Alum, Nathan Salwen, who created ultimate day camps for elementary students in Amherst, which indirectly is how Herscu learned about the sport, in the second grade.
Ultimate has been receiving more visibility in the younger age groups thanks to the Internet. For example, Booth has had some of her high school players appear on ESPN’s daily Top-Ten Countdown.
This spread is also greatly due to Booth’s work as an author. In 2008 she wrote a book titled, Essential Ultimate: Teaching, Coaching, Playing.
“I used to be able to keep track of everything that was going on in the Ultimate World in the US pretty easily, just because we were small,” she said. “Now we’re just bigger, which is great. The sport is growing, at a tremendous pace, and I think that pro leagues will only help that.”
Besides being a rather new sport, Ultimate has no doubt struggled to gain the same acceptance that traditional sports hold based on its origins.
“I think because the sport was developed in the late 60s and first associated with the counter-community, it was branded as not a real sport,” Booth said. “But I think that has changed radically in the last 10 years.”
“Especially when I started 14 years ago before, the sport was not even growing at all, it was like, “Oh that's something you do with your dog,” Graham added. “People just really didn’t have an idea even if it was an individual sport, or a team sport. There is certainly a percentage of the population that doesn’t even know what it is.”
From youth camps to professionals, the recent efforts to spread this sport with hopefully change this going forward.
Between late-night practices and full-weekend tournaments, the Red Line represents Harvard in the Ultimate world, and does it well.
When the final whistle blew last week, the professional and amateurs shook hands. After a brief team meeting, the members of the home squad lined up, arm and arm facing the crowd of fans who came out to watch. In unison, the Red Line sang “10,000 Men of Harvard” as a ceremonial finish to the night.
In that moment, the crowd was reminded of a very important thing. No matter what marketing mechanics are used to spread the ultimate craze, it is the players themselves that make it all happen.

Choosing where to eat among the many options in Harvard Square can be challenging. The decision is even more difficult for those with dietary restrictions.
In the past few decades, doctors have started to diagnose celiac disease—an autoimmune disease related to gluten—at greater rates, and researchers have theorized that causes of the disease may be genetic.
Now, Harvard Square eateries are making a push to better serve their gluten-intolerant customers.
The Harvard Square Business Association lists on its website eateries that are swapping out wheat for gluten-free ingredients.
"We started seeing a huge influx of people asking for [gluten-free options] really about three years ago," said Anthony S. Ackil '99, co-owner of b.good, which offers gluten-free buns, salads, and fries.
When Rachel E. Halperin '16 discovered her gluten-intolerance earlier this semester, she found multiple places to accommodate her needs in the Square, noting that Finale, J.P. Licks, and Panera all have gluten-free menus.
"Part of eating out gluten-free is just being creative and knowing what you can and can't eat," Halperin said. 
She stressed the importance of also being aware of a restaurant's less visible uses of gluten, such as thickening soups or salad dressings with flour.
Courtney M. Forrester, owner of Sweet Cupcakes, explained that guaranteeing gluten-free treats is nearly impossible in a traditional baking environment. Sweet does, however, carry four flavors from the dedicated gluten-free bakery Glutenus Minimus in Belmont, Mass. 
UpStairs on the Square started offering gluten-free pizza and is working to expand its gluten-free options, co-owner Mary-Catherine Deibel said. 
Deibel said she sees it as part of a restaurant's "mission to extend hospitality" to accommodate gluten-free customers like Halperin.
"On any given day, we encounter a lot of different dietary restrictions," she said. "I think any restaurant really needs to address that."

In the wake of Monday's Boston Marathon bombings, Brandon Stanton, photographer and creator of the popular "Humans of New York" blog, has brought his camera and his humanistic approach to Boston for the week.
Today, Stanton crossed the river and came to Cambridge, where he spent time taking photographs in and around Harvard Square (including this one featuring John Harvard's foot).
"With all the news centering around the bombing, I thought I'd focus on portraying normal life in Boston," Stanton wrote in an email. "Obviously Harvard is a big part of that. I very much enjoyed my visit to Cambridge today. [I] had some great conversations and met a lot of great people."
One photo from today's visit, which already has more Facebook "likes" than there are Harvard undergraduates, features Paul Lisker '16 looking down at Harvard Yard from the deck of the Science Center Observatory.
When Lisker—who hails from St. Louis, Mo. but is a longtime fan of the "HONY" blog—heard that Stanton was heading to Boston, he emailed him, inviting the photographer to Harvard's campus and volunteering himself as a tour guide. The two met up Wednesday morning and walked around Harvard Square while Stanton worked.
"The way that he sees people—which is that everyone has a story and everyone has secrets, if you're willing to approach [them] and willing to learn about their past—there's always the potential to find something unique," Lisker said of Stanton. "Ultimately that is what makes him such a popular photographer."
As for the experience of being featured in one of Stanton's iconic photographs, Lisker said, "It's very much my Warhol-type 15 minutes of fame."
