After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Musa Syeed is an award-winning filmmaker and a Briggs-Copeland Lecturer in the English department. He graduated from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, and since then has directed feature films including “Valley of Saints” (2012), “A Stray” (2016), and also co-wrote “Menashe” (2017). He is currently teaching two creative writing workshops on screenwriting and documentary writing.
The Harvard Crimson: What made you want to become a filmmaker?
Musa Syeed: I’ve always liked movies. I think some early experiences I had at the movies made me interested in picking up the camera. In particular, when I was, I don’t know, maybe 10 or 11 years old, there was some Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that came out where the bad guys in the movie looked like me or my family, I guess. So, one of the uncles from our community took us to the theater to protest the film. We were putting these pamphlets on people’s cars, trying to dispel stereotypes about Muslims. It struck me at that time how silly what we were doing was, that we were trying to take on this big Hollywood movie with this Xerox piece of paper that was not even well-written. So, I think at that time, I started to make little home movies and stuff, but I felt like this could be a career. I could create work that could tell a different story or tell a better story. So, that was part of the initial motivation.
At the same time, I just really love the spectacle of cinema. I was really into special effects at that time and doing green screen and riffs of “Star Wars” and things like that. So, my love for the medium, but then also... this sort of social good that it could do motivated me to go into film. I ended up going to NYU film school and since then, I’ve been making movies.
THC: Can you talk about your process or inspiration?
MS: When I went to film school, I hadn’t previously really been exposed to documentary filmmaking that much. With the people I’ve met there and classes that I took, I ended up focusing on documentary… I think making film this way felt like it opened more possibilities for people to tell a story together, in a way. Obviously, even in documentary, you’re still directing and manipulating footage, but the process of allowing the process to be informed by other people made [it] more exciting to me…
My first feature film, I made in Kashmir… When we were going to shoot it, there was this military curfew. There was a cycle of killings and protests that put the Valley of Kashmir on lockdown… We had to throw out the script and improvise with the local actors I had found. It was important to me to make that film at that time just because I had grown up not knowing much about this place.
THC: What ended up happening with the film?
MS: We ended up making the film, but we did it in this improvised kind of way with a very small crew of two people and myself, and with nonprofessional actors, all local actors and in Kushirian language, which is a language I don’t speak. That film ended up winning an Audience Award at Sundance and I think just the spontaneous quality of it, the authenticity of the performances and all that stuff was drawn because it was such a collaborative effort with the actors.
THC: What made you want to switch to teaching?
MS: A lot of the people who have been my students have ended up being my collaborators in different ways. My own mentors in college, they helped me get funding for my first film or continued to give me advice on everything… It’s fun for me to see the things people are working on and thinking about. And I mean, the landscape has changed even from when I first started out of school. There’s more consciousness and room for diversity.
THC: What do you hope to incorporate in your curriculum?
MS: Part of the documentary course was trying to get students off campus, to do field work, create new relationships and find subjects for documentaries. It’s been fun because a lot of students have told me it can be a bubble on campus and so getting students outside of that is good for everyone. And also [it’s] about training yourself to see stories in the world around you.

To the editor,
The Crimson story regarding Jeffrey Epstein omitted the central point I made in my interview with the reporter. I welcome an investigation by Harvard or any other institution, including prosecutors, into the wilfully false charges made by Virginia Roberts for financial gain. Omitting this crucial statement is irresponsible and unethical journalism.
Virginia Roberts leveled her false accusations four years ago. At the time, I disproved them categorically. The matter was put to rest, with even her lawyers admitting that it was a mistake and wrong. Then four years later the Miami Herald recycled this false accusation and The Crimson reported on the Herald’s recycled report. I wrote a letter to the editor of the Herald pointing to the incontrovertible evidence that Roberts made up the accusation out of whole cloth in order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner.
I was able to disprove Roberts’ false accusation by producing all of my travel, AmEx, and TV appearance records which showed where I was, and, more importantly, where I wasn’t during the entire period Virginia Roberts was in contact with Jeffrey Epstein. These records prove incontrovertibly that I could not have been, and was not, where Roberts’ falsely claimed to have met me — a Caribbean Island, a New Mexico Ranch, a private jet, a Palm Beach mansion — during the relevant time period.
I also called for an independent investigation by the former Director of the F.B.I., a highly respected former federal judge and assistant U.S. attorney. He reviewed all of the records and other evidence and concluded that “the totality of the evidence … refutes the allegations.”
In addition, the judge before whom the accusation was made struck the accusation from the record and sanctioned her lawyers for filing it. One of her own lawyers then acknowledged that his client was “wrong” “simply wrong,” and her other lawyers formally withdrew the accusation, admitting it was a “mistake.”
Not only did Virginia Roberts lie about me, she lied about Al and Tipper Gore and President Bill Clinton claiming that she met the three of them on Jeffrey Epstein’s island — a claim refuted by secret service records that established that none of the three were on that island during that period of time.
There is evidence that directly proves I was framed. These include emails between Roberts and a journalist, a book manuscript by Roberts and a legal brief that are smoking guns showing that I was “deliberately framed for financial reasons.” These exculpatory documents have been sealed by Roberts’ lawyers and I am seeking to make them public.
Roberts' closest friend told me that Roberts told her she “felt pressure to go after [Dershowitz]” in order to obtain money from Leslie Wexner and that Roberts had never previously included me among the people with whom she claimed to have had sex. I have a tape recording of this conversation.
Not surprisingly, Roberts made her false claims against me only in court documents that immunize her from being sued for defamation. When she was interviewed by the Miami Herald, she refused to repeat her false allegations outside of court. The Crimson did not ask her directly to repeat her false allegations to them. As a matter of journalistic ethics, The Crimson should not have published an accusation without interviewing the accuser on the record. I now challenge Roberts to repeat her false accusations to The Crimson or other media, so that I can sue her for defamation and let a jury decide — after seeing all the evidence including the emails and book manuscript — who is telling the truth and who is lying.
I want an investigation or trial to finally prove that Roberts made up the entire story, so that it can finally be put to rest.

Despite the recent onslaught of alarming revelations about Facebook, I use the app more frequently — entirely because of the new meme group “subtle asian traits.” This group, which has amassed over 800,000 members from across the world in the past few months, is full of memes about Asian life, updated at seemingly every second.
“subtle asian traits” is a welcome surprise for several reasons. One is its very existence. I never thought there would be a Facebook meme group for Asians, and I suppose I never thought that such a group could be appealing enough for Asians from across the world to clamor to join.
“subtle asian traits” is also welcome representation in surprising territory — it’s just memes, after all. One can argue that the group’s content consists mainly of stupid, or at least silly, posts, and I would be hard-pressed to disagree. Nevertheless, it does not follow that "subtle asian traits" itself is thus merely silly and stupid.
I, for example, think of the group fondly for fostering conversations about Asian-ness that are joyous, hilarious, and occasionally even enlightening. Thus, if the conversations I’ve had about Asian identity this semester were defined by the Harvard lawsuit for the first couple months, more recently they’ve been centered around "subtle asian traits" memes — and what a welcome respite.
That "subtle asian traits" makes for effective representation is especially surprising because it has not exactly demolished stereotypes. Rather, it traffics heavily in them. "subtle asian traits" does not do a good job living up to its name.
Granted, presumably the group is called "subtle asian traits" not to make an accurate statement about its contents but to match the naming pattern of similar groups for other demographics. But I will take the risk of overanalyzing this seemingly trivial thing because its impact has not been trivial.
Scroll through “subtle Asian traits,” and you will find countless posts on tiger moms, pre-med woes, bubble tea, and “Asian glow.” It wouldn’t take long to win a game of Asian stereotypes bingo — and there may in fact be many such memes already posted in the group. People who disdainfully see Asians in the worst, most overgeneralized light might find their views reinforced by the group’s content.
The proliferation of unsubtle stereotypes in the group may be surprising given how happily Asians have embraced it as representation. Isn’t the point of representation to counter stereotypes? Aren’t stereotypes damaging because of their lack of subtlety?
Shouldn’t fighting stereotypes require finding the subtleties in culture, illuminating individual stories? One might expect a group like "subtle asian traits" to be more like the story-driven Humans of New York — to bring out the stories of Asians across the world and dive in to find the truly hidden things. Such a group would make its real mission the unearthing of the subtleties of Asian existence.
Stereotypes and subtlety seem to be at odds, with the former preventing and the latter enabling good representation. How, then, to reconcile that "subtle asian traits" embraces stereotypes and ditches subtlety but still manages to be good representation for many Asians?
One answer could be, we are so starved for Asian representation that even hastily Photoshopped memes can be sustaining. This answer does not resolve the paradox, but suggests that we have mistakenly labeled "subtle asian traits" good representation. Perhaps — It is certainly true that there is not much Asian representation. But that answer is both unsatisfying and depressing, and does not give "subtle asian traits" enough credit.
Rather, I think there is something empowering about reveling in the group rather than the individual. The paradox stands on faulty legs: Stereotypes and subtlety may be at odds because of their definitions, but stereotypes and good representation are not mutually exclusive. Stereotypes themselves are not so much the problem as what people choose to do with them.
In “subtle asian traits,” we are affirming many stereotypes for ourselves, discovering and embracing all the ways our lives are actually similar, all the ties of Asian culture that hold across the world. It seems to me that we want to feel part of a group — a group, of Asians around the world, which we always knew we belonged to, but never had such a joyful reason to keep up with. So leave the subtleties and the individualism for another day. Today, give the people their silly, simple, and unsubtle memes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, Greek organizations filed two lawsuits in federal and state courts against Harvard. The organizations allege that the College’s social group policies constitute sex-based discrimination. These misguided lawsuits by mostly national entities challenge the College’s sanctions at the expense of a more equitable student experience. The resurgence of this issue underscores the need for the College to clarify and strengthen its worthwhile social group policy, and the need for Harvard to vigorously defend the policy.
The plaintiffs of the two suits, comprised mainly of the national or international parent organizations of a number of single-gender social groups, are concerned about the continued existence of their groups on campus. However, by suing Harvard they are inappropriately injecting themselves into the policies and internal politics of the College. We remain supportive of the sanctions; as we have written, they serve as “an initial corrective to the outsized influence of final clubs over undergraduate student life while helping combat their discriminatory practices,” and we maintain this belief.
These lawsuits may end up serving little purpose beyond draining University funds and time should they go to court. And given the languorous rate at which these lawsuits are likely to progress, the sanctions will remain settled policy at the College for the time being. The administration should act accordingly and not stand down. Particularly with renewed attention to the sanctions and potential doubt in their future, it is past time for the College to clearly and forcefully convey the rationale for the policy.
There are two main steps that the College should take. First, it should clarify the role of the sanctions and strengthen their enforcement mechanism. Many members of the Class of 2021 are now members of final clubs, fraternities, and sororities, speaking to the urgency of instituting the policy. Yet enforcement mechanisms remain shockingly opaque, and the sanctions will not reach their full potential without clear methods for enforcement. It is vital for the College to have a clear and concrete plan for handling breaches of the policy. With this once-internal Harvard debate now played out on the national stage, this issue is especially important.
Moreover, the College should fully elaborate the rationale for the sanctions. Administrators have changed the rationale for the sanctions policy over time. Originally, the sanctions were meant to combat sexual assault. This justification was replaced with an emphasis on the gender exclusivity of the final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Most recently, the goal of the sanctions seems to be a first step in eliminating all forms of discrimination on Harvard’s campus. This new lawsuit means that the University’s rationale for the sanctions will be evaluated and scrutinized. As such, administrators should make the reasoning for the sanctions clear and firmly support it.
These lawsuits may well generate a groundswell of public opposition to Harvard. We implore the College to stand up against the force of its critics. Though imperfectly introduced, the sanctions are a badly needed means for combating discriminatory policies and the hegemony of exclusive, single-gender groups on campus. They remain an important mechanism for achieving a better undergraduate experience for all students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kinsmans were my favorite, and they were the first two peaks I hiked alone. I can still remember standing at the edge of Lonesome Lake, looking across the placid water at Cannon Mountain and Franconia Ridge and feeling utterly at peace amid the gentle breeze and swaying trees.
If the Harvard bubble feels claustrophobic at times and its pressures are overwhelming, adventure awaits up north.
New Hampshire has 48 4,000-foot peaks, dotting the White Mountains, and the Kinsmans are two of them. The 4,000-footers, as they are affectionately known, range from the 4,003-foot Mt. Tecumseh, with its short and direct trail scraping alongside a local ski area to the 6,288-foot Mt. Washington, famous for its pernicious weather and howling winds.
Thousands of hikers tackle the 48 in an effort to join the official Four Thousand Footer Club, reserved only for those who have “bagged” them all. The group recently surpassed 14,000 members and is now growing by 800 a year. Recent book releases — Following Atticus is my personal favorite — and social media attention have given the club a boost. Harvard students would do well to join these ranks.
The membership application is simple — a form cataloguing the date and participants of each hike, an essay recounting a favorite peak or lesson learned, and a $15 fee. Each new member receives a patch, a certificate, and a pizza dinner at an annual Appalachian Mountain Club celebration in New Hampshire.
Eric L. Savage, the Four Thousand Footer Club’s corresponding secretary, has read most of the essays over the past 15 years. Peak baggers’ reasons vary for embarking on the journey. Savage has recounted to me hikers reluctantly dragged along by friends on their first trek, only to fall in love with the White Mountains and finish the entire list. Some climbed to honor loved ones who passed away. Many suffered tragic life events and fled to the mountains for reflection and healing.
And others, like me, simply adore New Hampshire, love hiking, and view the mountains as an escape from Harvard’s daily stresses. My own experiences offer a guideline for Harvard students seeking reprieve from work, grades, and careers.
I grew up in the southern part of the state, spent my summers in the Lakes Region, and went to college up north. I started hiking the 48 with my dad, but he’s since surpassed me and finished them all. The quest has forced me to explore new contours of the White Mountains — its unexpected views, untouched wilderness, and dozens of tiny towns scattered between trailheads. No such wonders exist in Cambridge, but they can be found within a few hours of driving.
My most cherished memories have taken place on 4,000-footers. One summer evening, my boyfriend and I hiked up Mt. Moosilauke in the pitch black to see the July 4 fireworks. Upon reaching the summit, we were caught in a torrential downpour and were forced to flee, eventually recovering with chocolate chip pancakes at 2:00 a.m. in a 24-hour truck stop. We didn’t see any fireworks.
Or take my hike up the Tripyramids with four friends and their two dogs. While climbing the peak’s infamous rock slide, an unexpected flurry left behind an icy frost. We proceeded to slip and slide up the entire mountain, and we were so weak from laughing that we could barely make it to the top. Once we did, the snow-covered landscape was so breathtaking we never wanted to descend.
I met one of my best friends, Kara L. Hedges, while hiking down from the summit of a 4,000-footer. While chatting away, I realized we’d be in each others’ lives for quite a while. Kara has completed 42 of 48, her progress temporarily derailed by a cross-country move to Seattle. The unclimbed six peaks are how I know she’ll eventually return home to New Hampshire.
I’m a bit behind her. I climbed my 37th peak, Mt. Moriah, this summer. Each subsequent summit has become increasingly bittersweet. I’m eager to claim my patch but sad at the thought of this journey nearing its end.
Amid our hectic lives here in Cambridge, we often forget to take advantage of the natural beauty in our own backyard. And worse, we lose sight of the absolute joy of a simple adventure. The 48 isn’t graded, and there’s no time limit. You can hike them slowly or quickly, with friends or alone. They take you to corners of the earth you might not have otherwise explored. I’ve found that these moments of escape provide me with new energy and mental clarity, and the lost homework and meeting hours are worth every second.
I’m hopeful the 48 are catching on. A Harvard classmate hiked her first two peaks a few weekends ago. She became so enamored with the White Mountains, she immediately downloaded the official Four Thousand Footer Club list.
Forty-six to go, she said.

Daylight hours are getting shorter in Cambridge — and apparently, Faculty meetings are, too. At the last monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of the year on Tuesday, the Faculty voted to approve all items on the agenda in less than half an hour.
Before the docket items, University President Bacow spoke to the half-empty room about the importance of higher education in today’s political climate. He pointed to the recent announcement of the closing of Central European University in Budapest as “a result of an authoritarian government.” Bacow emphasized the importance of academic freedom, calling for Faculty to not take the liberty for granted.
“I’m concerned they represent a global shift in attitudes towards higher education,” Bacow said. “We need to stand up for the values in which institutions like this and many other institutions around the world are deeply rooted in, again, values of academic freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of press.”
The Faculty voted to slightly modify the new course schedule by adding new class start times at 12:45 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke presented the changes, which he first introduced at November's Faculty meeting.
In a follow up to its November meeting, Burke reiterated to Faculty that the additional class start times aim to give students more time for lunch. Shortly after the new schedule started this fall semester, Harvard University Dining Services opened dining halls at 11:30 a.m., 30 minutes earlier than usual, to accommodate students who had classes beginning at noon.
“The rationale behind this was to stretch out the time during which a student can get lunch,” he said.
David Howell, chair of the Faculty Council Election Review Committee, reported to the Faculty the findings of the committee, which had been tasked to review election procedures three years after the rules were amended in 2015. The Faculty voted in November 2015 to streamline the election rules, which a report issued earlier that year had called “unnecessarily complicated” and “confusing.”
Now, the Faculty elects six new members to the Council each year — three to “At Large” seats and one to represent each of the three divisions within FAS.
The committee found that after the new rules were put in place, voter turnout increased and more faculty agreed to stand for election to the Council after being nominated. The committee recommended that the Faculty keep the new elections procedures in place.
The committee also proposed that the Faculty create a forum for non-ladder junior faculty to give input on faculty issues. One possible way in which the Faculty could do accomplish this goal is to “convene” a group to participate in FAS governance with a liaison member who attends Faculty Council meetings once or twice a year, Howell said.
The Faculty also voted to approve summer school courses for 2019.
Though the monthly Faculty meeting is scheduled for two hours, Tuesday’s meeting clocked in at just 25 minutes. Upon its conclusion, Bacow wished everyone a happy holiday season.
“This being the holiday season, we've given you the most precious gift — the gift of time,” he said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow praised the Medical School’s health policy department and discussed the importance of higher education at a symposium at the school Tuesday.
The symposium, held at the school’s New Research Building on the Longwood campus, celebrated the 30th anniversary of the department. In addition to Bacow, Panelists included Peter Slavin, president of Massachusetts General Hospital, Richard G. Frank, professor of healthcare policy at the Medical School, and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius.
In the panel, Bacow discussed the importance of higher education, and especially health policy research, for the country.
“These are difficult times for higher education in the United States. We have our critics almost everywhere you look,” Bacow said.
Bacow said public skepticism towards higher education was partly derived from a perception that institutions are not doing enough for the rest of society.
“Part of that criticism is based on the view that institutions like this are perhaps in the eyes of some — I don’t believe this is true — more concerned about making themselves great than they are making the world better,” he said.
Since Bacow took office in July, he has spent significant time advocating for the public images of Harvard and higher education generally. In September, he visited his home state of Michigan in an attempt to show that Harvard can benefit economically struggling areas. This week, on a trip to San Diego, he addressed critiques that Harvard does not care about people beyond its gates.
At the symposium, Bacow also attributed declining levels of public support for state universities to rising Medicaid costs.
“There’s a very direct line that can be drawn between our inability to control Medicaid expenditures, and to think about how we provide healthcare to the poor, and our ability to support public higher education,” he said. “It is why I think the work that you are doing here is critically important.”
Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 was unable to attend the symposium in person, but joined the conference with a recorded message praising the department’s work.
“When I travel around the country, one of the things that people inevitably mention is their admiration for the department and its great work,” he said.
Throughout the afternoon, professors and hospital presidents spoke about healthcare policy topics, including the individual private insurance market, Medicaid, and healthcare financing models.
Later in the symposium, Sebelius discussed American healthcare policy and the future of the Affordable Care Act after the midterm elections.
“The march to universal coverage, as slow, and difficult and painful as it is, will continue in the United States of America. And I’m just delighted I had a small part in that wonderful march toward equity,” she said.

Jameson “Jim” N. Marvin, who directed the Harvard choirs from 1978 to 2010, opened his final season with the Jameson Singers choir, consisting of Harvard alumni and Boston residents, last Saturday.
Before founding the Jameson Singers in 2010, Marvin led the Collegium, Glee Club, and Radcliffe Choral Society performance groups, directing thousands of student musicians in his several years at Harvard. From 1978-2010, he was also a senior lecturer in the Music Department.
Choral conducting, which Marvin refers to as "waving his arms," has been “a life-living of great reward and enrichment,” he said.
Marvin is a demanding director and constantly “striving for perfection,” Logan S. McCarty ’96, a current Jameson Singers performer and Glee Club alumnus, said.
Marvin was known for rigorous ear-training and strict policy on tardiness by his singers, many of whom said he developed Harvard’s choirs into prestigious ensembles.
Indeed, Marvin said one of his proudest accomplishments from his time at Harvard was turning the Harvard choruses into a nationally recognized program. “When I got to Harvard, the choral society was sort of limping along,” he said. But after a few years of touring and performing at national choral conferences, Marvin said the Harvard groups became more widely known and admired.
“He's just a master of choral conducting, a master at creating a sound, a choral sound that is rich and blended and beautifully in tune and musical,” McCarty said. “The musical experience of singing with Jim is really truly extraordinary.”
Kelly M. Flynn ’91, the former president of Collegium, concurred. She said even though she “never had a great vocal apparatus per se,” Marvin still included her in the choruses and worked with her to train her voice. “It was about pursuing perfection,” she added.
Flynn, who had a lisp, said the dictation training she received “liberated” her.
“I learned to talk around my lisp, and that was totally from Jim,” she said.
Marvin’s former students recall his presence beyond rehearsal, too. Flynn recounted his “silliness” at post-concert dances, where he joined the undergraduates on the dance floor by imitating household chores.
“I never really knew whether Jim couldn't actually dance or he just wanted to be silly,” Flynn said.
Lisa Rucinski, the current president of the Jameson Singers, said singing under Marvin was “just seamless, there's no separation, it's like we are his instrument and he is playing us expressively.”
Recalling his time at Harvard, Marvin said he was proud of his legacy.
“I had an impact on a lot of these students, and that I’m so proud of. It means so much to me,” he said.
After over forty years of choral directing, Marvin will rest his arms after the choir’s last concert in May. He will be succeeded by Kevin C. Leong, the current assistant conductor of the Jameson Singers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly a year after students overwhelmingly voted in favor of an Undergraduate Council referendum asking whether the College should fund class-wide programming events for sophomores and juniors, UC leaders — backed by administrators — have embarked on a concerted push to make the students’ desire a reality.
In the past few years, class-wide events for sophomores and juniors have occurred infrequently, and the issue did not feature prominently in the recent Council presidential election. Nonetheless, new UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said Monday that “institutionalizing” sophomore and junior class events will be an early “priority” as she begins her tenure.
Last month, the UC collaborated with the Dean of Students Office, the Advising Programs Office, and the Harvard Coop to organize a sophomore declaration event in Annenberg Hall, after zero class-wide events for sophomores took place in 2017. Multiple attendees praised the event — which drew hundreds of students — for giving them the opportunity to see friends from freshman year.
Class-wide programming for juniors has been even more sporadic. The only event for the junior class in recent years came in 2017. That event, meant as an opportunity for reflection, only drew a few dozen students.
Former Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said in an interview Sunday she believes the decentralized nature of the upperclassmen house system can at times hinder potential interactions between students.
“Being able to have events and programming that brings the entire class together I think is so special,” she said. “I’ve seen how much it means to students and how much there currently lacks in terms of spaces where all of the class can come together, not separated into houses, not separated into academic communities, not separated into organizations.”
The Council’s constitution requires that the body publish a policy paper about any referendum supported by a majority of voters, in order to outline how the UC would work to implement the proposal. The policy paper about class-wide programming, written by Zhang and released last week, cites a survey conducted by the University’s Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging — which published its official report in March 2018 — showing that students felt a decreased sense of belonging during their sophomore and junior years.
“The policy paper that was put together I think gives us a really good frame as to how we should approach class-wide programming and which offices we should also be collaborating with in order to best support these events in the future and make sure that they will continue regularly,” Palaniappan said.
She added that she would be willing to use Council money to fund class-wide events, but would like to see the College administration eventually take on more of the financial burden for these events.
A key component of the Council’s plan will be establishing sophomore and junior class committees, likely similar in makeup to committees already in place for freshman and seniors, according to Palaniappan. The sophomore and junior committees would likely be composed of former members of the first-year class committee, the College Events Board, and the UC, as well as other interested students, Palaniappan said.
The policy paper notes that many peer institutions, including Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell, already have such committees in place for each class year.
“All of these different universities have mentioned how integral these committees have been to their campus, in terms of creating a sense of inclusion and belonging,” Zhang wrote.
The administration appears to at least broadly support the students’ demands. The DSO conducted two focus groups in recent weeks — one with tutors and another with undergraduates — to gather information about the “sophomore and junior experience,” according to Katie Steele, senior director of student engagement and leadership.
“I think hearing more about the current student experience, will help us to figure out how we can improve and enhance supports in the future,” Steele wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four panelists — coming from academic, political organizing, and consulting backgrounds — discussed the unprecedented number of female candidates in this year’s midterm elections with an audience of more than 100 Harvard affiliates and Boston area residents Tuesday.
The event, entitled, “The Meaning of the Midterms: Who Counted? Who Voted?” took place in the Radcliffe Institute’s Knafel Center as this year’s Kim and Judy Davis Dean’s Lecture.
Asma Khalid, a political reporter for National Public Radio, moderated the panel discussion, which focused on recent voter turnout, the changing electorate, and the 2020 presidential election.
The event’s speakers included Aimee Allison, president of the political organization Democracy in Color; Sarah Lenti, a political consultant; Katherine J. Cramer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Robert O. Self, a professor of American history at Brown University.
Government Professor Daniel Carpenter, director of the social sciences program at the Radcliffe Institute, said he chose the panelists out of a desire to look at the elections from a wide variety of standpoints, like “people looking at voter conversations, people looking at data, people looking about history, people looking at ethnography.”
“So it was really just an attempt to diversify the conversation,” Carpenter said.
Khalid opened the panel by acknowledging how widespread and exhaustive media coverage of the midterm elections has been, but said she believed there was still plenty to learn.
“Candidly, I think some of us feel we’ve been in this rut in reporting on the midterms for so many months,” she said. “But I think there are lots of lessons to learn about what happened in 2018, that can help us try to decipher what will happen in 2020.”
Allison’s takeaway from the midterms was that “women of color won the elections.” Though all women candidates of color, like former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, may not have secured the seats for which they ran, they still managed to “reinvent the playbook” for a game in which their “opponent is the referee,” she said.
In her remarks, Allison said Abrams had people on the ground, knocking on doors and registering eligible voters, instead of accepting the electorate as a static body and running television ads to reach her base.
Fellow panelist Lenti, who left the Republican party in 2016 for what she called “obvious reasons,” had a takeaway that some audience members said they found sobering. She explained that the results of midterm elections have not historically determined the winning party in the next presidential election.
“Despite the fact that the Dems just won the midterms, [Trump] might win in 2020,” she said. “Midterm results have little to no bearing on upcoming presidential elections.”
Sarah E. Freedman, a Boston resident who attended the panel, said she felt disheartened by Lenti’s assessment of potential political realities.
“It was very upsetting to hear that it’s just as likely [Trump] will be president and that the midterm elections mean absolutely nothing,” she said.
Other attendees said they believed the panel came at an important moment to continue conversations around the midterm results and their ramifications.
“I feel like right after elections, all the coverage is just about how it was revolutionary in terms of women in power and how Democratic states won, but I feel like because it’s been weeks after, there is more analysis now and more significance about why it matters, other than it just happened,” Boston University freshman Carina Y. Wang said.
Allison said she is hopeful about the prospects of women of color in the 2020 elections.
“Women of color, who showed such tremendous power at the polls, I believe will lead, because they’re creating a country of love and justice and belonging,” Allison said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A coalition of women’s law associations from law schools across the country announced Monday that they will no longer accept funding from law firms that require employees to sign mandatory arbitration agreements, and praised the work of Havard Law's Pipeline Parity Project on the issue.
The Pipeline Parity Project, a Harvard Law School student group focused on ending harassment and discrimination in the legal profession, executed a successful boycott of the world’s highest grossing law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. After receiving pressure from the group, Kirkland & Ellis announced it was ending mandatory arbitration agreements — contracts that require employees to resolve workplace disputes with employers through an arbitration process, rather than through the courts — for its associates.
In a statement Monday, the boards of women’s law associations, including the Executive Board of the Harvard Women’s Law Association, praised the Kirkland & Ellis boycott.
“We, the 2018-2019 boards of women's law associations at law schools across the country, applaud the enormous efforts of the Harvard Law students to call out recalcitrant employers, and we celebrate their success,” the coalition wrote in a statement.
The boards also wrote about why they felt it was important to speak out, highlighting how the controversial agreements disadvantage the “most vulnerable employees,” including women, people of color, and BGLTQ individuals, among others.
Weeks after Kirkland & Ellis agreed to amend their policies, the Pipeline Parity Project has moved on to pressuring law firm DLA Piper to drop their forced agreements.
DLA Piper — one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the world — does not appear to be as willing as Kirkland & Ellis to drop their agreements. Quoted in a Law.com article, the firm said that they find arbitration to be “fair and efficient.”
“There are advantages and disadvantages to every type of dispute resolution process,” the firm’s statement reads. “It has been our experience as a firm that arbitration is a fair and efficient way to resolve internal disputes, and one that benefits all parties in what are often sensitive matters for everyone involved.”
Second-year Law student and Pipeline Parity Project member Molly M.E. Coleman said the group was disappointed with DLA Piper’s statement, but members will continue to pressure the firm, especially given the support from women’s law associations across the country.
“We’ve had a ton of support from people in the broader legal community who were likewise alarmed by DLA’s response and we’ve had an outpouring of support here on campus so we’re very confident that this campaign will continue to push forward,” Coleman said.
Though the group has started a second boycott, they have not completed the Kirkland & Ellis campaign, according to second-year law student and Pipeline Parity Project member Alexandra “Vail” Kohnert-Yount.
“The Kirkland campaign is sort of ongoing because they haven’t actually dropped forced arbitration for their no-lawyer staff — they haven’t totally capitulated either,” Kohnert-Yount said.
While the other law student organization signatories pledged to refuse funding from the law firms whose practices they are trying to change, the Harvard Women’s Law Association wrote in a footnote to the letter that it is not changing its policies on accepting funding at this time.
“We are currently reviewing our sponsorship offerings and requirements, and expect updated guidelines before the start of the 2019-20 fundraising cycle,” a footnote in the coalition’s statement reads. “However, given the size of our organization and board, as well as our interest in further considering how to address sponsors using mandatory arbitration in contracts for non-attorney staff, partners, and counsel, we are not announcing full policy changes at this time.”
The group added that it “wholeheartedly supports the values and policies outlined in this letter.”
Harvard Women’s Law Association president Isabel P. Finley did not comment directly on the coalition's statement, but pointed to her own recent statement on the Harvard Women’s Law Association’s website.
In her statement, Finley announced that “an overwhelming majority” of the association’s board voted to relinquish Kirkland & Ellis’s sponsorship of their annual spring conference. Finley wrote that the law firm gave $25,000 to the association annually — making it the organization’s largest sponsor — in exchange for the conference sponsorship.
Finley articulated this decision in a letter to Kirkland & Ellis on Nov. 14 — prior to the law firm’s announcement that they were discontinuing mandatory arbitration agreements for associates.
Finley wrote that even though her organization is “thrilled” about this change, the discontinuation of the agreements does not go far enough as the policy only applies for associates and not all employees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An online petition calling on Harvard to divest its holdings in the fossil fuel industry had garnered 150 signatures as of Tuesday evening.
The petition, which was formed last week and circulated around House lists, includes a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow from the Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice that asks him to “bring a new voice and vision to Harvard’s role in climate reform.”
The letter calls on Bacow to see Harvard not only as an “institution of higher education but also a financial institution with considerable social influence.”
“The University’s continued investment in unsustainable industries undermines our shared vision of Harvard as a forward-looking and ethically responsible institution,” the letter reads.
The petition also specifically urges the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — and the Harvard Management Company to “take serious climate action.” The group wrote that they are “ready” to meet with both bodies and Bacow to devise “pathways for divestment.”
Ilana A. Cohen ’22, the secretary of Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice, said students are “eager” to see the University take action on this issue.
“We are putting ourselves to be at the table, and we need them to meet us there in order to make real progress on taking this serious climate action,” Cohen said.
The petition comes after the November Undergraduate Council elections, in which 71.5 percent of student voters supported a referendum that called on Harvard to divest from the “fossil fuel industry.” That figure is virtually unchanged from 2012, the last time students voted on the issue. In that election, 72 percent of students voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment.
In response to the petition Tuesday, University spokesperson Melodie Jackson reiterated Harvard’s years-long stance on fossil fuel divestment in an emailed statement. Jackson said that though the University recognizes the threat of climate change, Harvard will not pursue divestment as a means to combat environment challenges.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it,” Jackson wrote.
Jackson pointed to the University’s “Climate Action Plan,” which was released in February and includes a plan to make Harvard fossil fuel-free by 2050. Former University President Drew G. Faust announced the goal to Harvard affiliates in an email, writing that “ambitious climate goals” set by the University come in response to the threat climate change poses to humanity and the planet.
Jackson wrote that the Corporation will continue to “actively incorporate” factors of environmental, social, and governance significance in its investment work.
“Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions,” Jackson wrote.
The issue of divestment has a long history on Harvard’s campus. Throughout her tenure, Faust did not support divestment from the fossil-fuel industry, and faced critism from students. In 2013, she explicitly rejected divestment, writing in a press release that the action was not “warranted or wise.” Environmental activist group Divest Harvard blockaded Massachusetts Hall for six days in April 2015 to pressure administrators on the issue.
In recent months, Harvard-affiliated activists have called the University to divest from not only the fossil-fuel industry, but also the prison industry.
Asked in an October interview whether Harvard would consider divesting from prisons, Bacow said altering the endowment is not an appropriate mechanism to “achieve political ends or particular policy ends.”
“There are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don't think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that,” Bacow said.
The petition also wrote that, during a meeting with members of Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice as part of his regularly scheduled office hours, Bacow “casually dismissed divestment.”
Jackson wrote that the University will “continue to support” its faculty, students, and staff as they pursue research on renewable sources of energy and the effects of climate change.
Cohen said Harvard can use its “incredible amount of moral influence” and “really unique economic influence” to make a significant impact if it commits to divestment from the fossil-fuel industry.
“We have an unusual capacity to display leadership for our peer institutions and the resistance of the Harvard administration in displaying that leadership,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renowned civil rights lawyer Bryan A. Stevenson addressed a packed John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday evening, sharing personal stories of both sorrow and success from his career in criminal justice reform, and calling on attendees to “change the narratives” that Stevenson said wrongly tint the way we think about justice.
Stevenson stressed his conviction that to make maximal change, one must spend time in the places where the problem exists—rather than in elite spheres of academia or politics.
This, for Stevenson, means “getting and staying proximate” to those who are behind bars or at risk of ending up there—“the people who are poor and suffering and marginalized.”
“Proximity is power,” Stevenson repeated several times.
Stevenson received a standing ovation both before and after the hour-long event, which was hosted by the Institute of Politics and moderated by Sarah E. Wald, senior policy advisor and chief of staff to the dean at Harvard Kennedy School. Former University President Drew G. Faust and many freshman members-elect of Congress, who were on campus for an IOP conference, attended the event.
Stevenson — founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative — has dedicated his career to challenging mass incarceration and discrimination in the criminal justice system. He has fought against lengthy prison sentences, advocated for children who are prosecuted as adults, and worked to get people off of death row. In 2012 he argued before the United States Supreme Court in a landmark case that ended life sentences without parole for all minors. Stevenson has degrees from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School.
After a brief introduction by Wald, Stevenson framed his speech through the overarching question of how to change the world.
“I really just want to reinforce the importance of what brought you here,” Stevenson said. “I believe we can change the world, and I think we need to change the world.” Stevenson then cited a number of studies highlighting the U.S.’s incommensurate rate of incarceration and the racial and socioeconomic disparities in the criminal justice system.
“But I didn’t come to talk about the problems,” Stevenson said after a few minutes of presenting data. “I want to use the limited time I have to talk about solutions.”
He said he realized the importance of personally interacting with disadvantaged individuals during his time at the Law School, when he traveled to prisons to represent death row inmates.
“I met a condemned man who was literally dying for legal assistance,” he said. “Even though I was very ignorant of most of the things that he needed answers to, my proximity, my witness seemed to make a difference.”
Stevenson then discussed how reframing social narratives can make a big difference in public policy. Recounting his experiences in the criminal justice system, he said changing social stereotypes both reduces fear and increases hope.
“I’m here to tell you that if we allow ourselves to be governed by fear and anger, we’ll tolerate things we’re not supposed to tolerate,” he said. “Hopelessness is the enemy of justice.”
Stevenson concluded his speech with a call to action, encouraging audience members to do things that are uncomfortable and inconvenient.
“I looked and did some research, and I tried to find an example where justice prevailed, where equality triumphed, and nobody had to do anything uncomfortable or inconvenient,” he said. “I can’t find any examples of that.”
After the event, several students said they were energized by Stevenson’s address.
“It was a blessing,” first-year HKS student Bernice M. Fokum said. “I think Bryan Stevenson is the orator of our generation. He was able to solidify concepts that are so difficult to bring to an audience of this magnitude.”
Former Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ‘19 also said the appreciated Stevenson’s message.
“I’m slightly overwhelmed with really positive emotions, and very inspired for the future,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The pair of lawsuits challenging Harvard’s sanctions rely on unusual and in some cases far-fetched legal arguments — but it is too early to know whether the complaints will be successful, experts say.
Analysts said the plaintiffs in the twin suits — two fraternities, two sororities, and three anonymous College students — are pursuing creative legal strategies in arguing the sanctions constitute civil rights violations and sex-based discrimination. Experts added the decision to file suit in both federal and state court is a savvy move and may bolster the social groups’ chances of victory.
The federal suit alleges the sanctions amount to sex-based discrimination and violate Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law, and the United States Constitution. The state-level case argues the sanctions violate the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act and the Massachusetts Constitution because the penalties cause students to receive unequal treatment based on their sex.
Harvard’s sanctions prohibit members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity team athletic captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships including the Rhodes. The sanctions took effect with the Class of 2021.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane defended the school’s policy in a written statement Tuesday.
“Harvard College seeks to build a community in which every student can thrive, and it does so on a foundation of shared values, including belonging, inclusion, and non-discrimination,” she wrote. “Harvard should not have to change its commitment to non-discrimination and educational philosophy for outside organizations that are not aligned with our long-standing mission.”
Experts said that, by citing several different laws in two different courts, the social groups are essentially throwing out as as many claims as they can and hoping one sticks.
Merrick T. Rossein, a professor at the CUNY School of Law who has litigated Title IX cases, said students and social groups probably also hope the slew of complaints will attract significant media attention.
“I’m assuming that they’re just feeling that they’re going to try to put as many of their claims in as many of the kitchen sinks as possible to see which one would stick,” Rossein said. “They might also be doing it just for the media interest in a suit that gets filed simultaneously in both the state and federal courts that’s of interest to people.”
Douglas E. Fierberg, an attorney who specializes in sexual violence cases involving fraternities, said the fact there are two separate suits could increase the likelihood that the courts will take up some of the allegations. He said the social groups’ path to victory is clearest through state court.
The social groups’ strategy may be “to protect some of the state claims and allow them to go forward while they engage in a fishing expedition in federal court,” Fierberg said. “Perhaps the plaintiffs aren’t confident — they shouldn’t be — about federal law applying to Harvard’s decision and prohibiting Harvard’s decision.”
Both Fierberg and Rossein said some of the suits’ allegations are unlikely to hold up in court.
“There’s some claims that I think are really more than stretching it,” Rossein said. “They’re claiming a violation of equal protection. The Constitution, the federal Constitution, applies to states, not to private entities.”
The federal complaint alleges Harvard’s sanctions violate the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act by infringing on students’ Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law. The state law includes a provision that specifically affirms this right.
Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 said lawyers will have to get “creative” going forward if they hope to argue Massachusetts state law protects students’ right to join social groups. The attorneys are specifically alleging the penalties violate undergraduates’ freedom of association as guaranteed under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
Feldman said the freedom of association argument may prove viable. But he also noted Harvard may have its own claim to freedom of association under Massachusetts law: the University could argue that it has the freedom to associate — and not associate — with whomever it chooses, he said. Under this interpretation of the law, Harvard would have broad discretion to sanction social groups.
It’s unclear whether Harvard or the Greek groups are more likely to win in court, analysts said — in part because the Monday lawsuits raise uncommon legal arguments for which there is little precedent.
Fierberg said he is not aware of any previous case in which fraternities or sororities used Title IX to defend their existence on a university’s campus.
“I don’t know if they’ve tried it before,” Fierberg said. “I’ve not directly heard of it. It’s a novel way of twisting Title IX.”
Gregory F. Hauser, an attorney who has worked on a number of cases involving fraternities, also called the plaintiffs’ use of Title IX unusual.
“When Title IX says you can’t discriminate against anybody on the basis of sex, it doesn’t reach this kind of decision by Harvard,” Hauser said. “So the argument that the plaintiffs are making — that prohibiting joining single-sex organizations is discrimination on the basis of sex — is plowing new ground.”
Rossein pointed to several historical court cases that involved single-gender social organizations including the 1984 Supreme Court case Roberts v. United States Jaycees, which addressed questions of sex-based discrimination and freedom of association.
While experts generally agreed on the novel nature of the lawsuits, they disagreed on the ultimate outcome.
“At the end of the day the fraternities are going to lose — just a question of timing,” Fierberg said.
Hauser, though, said Harvard could run into difficulties — particularly if it tries to argue that the University’s right to “academic freedom” means it can limit student involvement in private, off-campus organizations.
“The extent to which a court would recognize Harvard’s academic freedom at issue here — and they might — I’m sure Harvard’s going to make the argument — is an open question,” Hauser said. “Is an argument available to Harvard? Absolutely yes. Is an argument that’s going to win? Not necessarily.”
As legal experts ponder the case, others are picking sides. Scores of fraternities and sororities across the nation announced support for the plaintiffs on Monday. A petition hosted on the plaintiffs’ website that asks signatories to “stand up to Harvard” had garnered more than 45,000 signatures as of Tuesday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second the clock stopped, the once-silent crowd erupted.
With 3:43 remaining in the fourth quarter, the game was too close for comfort for the Black Bears. Maine’s consistent lead throughout its game against Harvard had shrunk to a difference of six points, a gap modest enough for Black Bear coach Amy Vachon to call a timeout.
Suddenly, the match between Maine (6-2) and the Crimson (4-5) transformed from a battle between players to a battle between the crowds. For the remainder of the game, the audience remained at its feet, with fans from the Pine Tree State cheering each time a Black Bear ball found net and the Harvard’s men’s basketball team jeering every time Maine’s shots bounced off the backboard. However, the Crimson’s concentrated effort to throw the Black Bears off its scent failed to prevent Maine from clinging to its lead. For each fourth-quarter field goal Harvard scored, Black Bear guard Dor Saar came back with a pair of successful foul shots, ultimately earning Maine a 67-60 victory over the Crimson.
“[Our play today was] very inconsistent,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I have veterans who were shockingly inconsistent and making freshman mistakes as seniors and juniors. I’d say that I’m pretty disappointed in the consistency of our play today.”
For the women at Lavietes, the first-quarter battle for dominance was defined by momentum, a force that was most certainly not the side of the Crimson. For every successful drive executed by Harvard, the Black Bears seemed to growl back with two field goals of their own. Maine set in stone its penchant for payback when a mid-quarter foul of Black Bear guard Blanca Millan by Crimson captain Madeline Raster was answered with a steal, shot, and score by Millan herself.
However, Raster did not come away from the play unscathed. An apparent leg injury incurred during the foul sent the South Bend, Ind. native to the bench for the remainder of the game, a loss that Delaney-Smith cited as “not easy.”
A second-quarter pep talk by Delaney-Smith seemed to turn the game around for Harvard, who decreased the scoring difference to six by the half. A pair of three-pointers served as third-quarter bookends for the Crimson, a squad revamped from its first-quarter performance. However, fierce mid-game play by Harvard was not enough to take home the victory.
“We did a great job during the second and third quarters, but not so much the first and fourth,” Delaney-Smith said. “I mean, we started slow and we finished slow. In a game, that’s not going to work. In the end, we had a lot of really good shots but they didn’t fall and we didn’t hit our free throws. We had our chances, but overall, [Maine] hit their shots and we didn’t.”
A large segment of Tuesday night’s crowd was made up of high schoolers donning light blue and gray, a signature Black Bear look. However, this squad actually came in support of Harvard freshman guard Maggie McCarthy, a Medfield High School graduate.
“It was awesome [playing in front of my high school team],” McCarthy said. “It brought back a lot of old memories. My sister’s on the team now and my parents were in the stands, so I was lucky to be able to play in this game, but I was definitely ready.”
In spite of the Crimson’s inconsistency, Delaney-Smith described McCarthy as the best defensive player on the floor.
“I think [McCarthy] is going to be a superstar,” Delaney-Smith said. “I decided tonight that as soon as one guard messed up, I was going to go to [McCarthy], and I felt the same about [Tess Sussman]. Those two freshmen have been very consistent day in and day out, so I expect that both of them will step up and play more.”
Perhaps no bleacher-dweller had more confidence in the Crimson than Brighton, Mass., native and official Fan of the Game Quinn Bligh, whose Dorito-stained face and dynamic dance moves adorned the sidelines throughout the game. The three-year old described the Crimson as “playing good” and held out hope for a Harvard victory, even as the women in white were down by six at the half.
Going into the Crimson’s next match against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, Delaney-Smith fears that her team’s general inconsistency and the loss of Raster will not help Harvard’s chances.
“Knowing historically who Rutgers is, next game is going to be a tough one,” Delaney-Smith said. “Who knows? I might just have to change the starting lineup and shake things up this weekend.”

Harvard men’s hockey freshman Jack Drury has been named to the United States’ preliminary camp roster for the 2019 IIHF World Junior Championship, per USA Hockey’s official announcement on Wednesday evening.
The 18-year-old is one of 29 Americans who will contend for a final roster spot for the tournament, taking place in Vancouver and Victoria, B.C., from Dec. 26, 2018 to Jan. 5, 2019.
“[I found out by] phone call a few days ago,” Drury said. “Initially, I was just really happy. Any time you get the opportunity to represent your country, it’s something special and definitely something that I’m looking forward [to] and hoping I can do.”
Drury, a center for the Crimson, will need to beat out several of the 16 forward invites to secure a chance to represent the stars and stripes this winter. The Winnetka, Ill., native will attempt to do so at the team’s camp, which lasts from Dec. 15 to Dec. 20 and splits time between Everett, Wash., and Kamloops, B.C.
A Harvard skater has donned the red, white, and blue in the past three World Junior Championships. Former standout Ryan Donato skated to a bronze medal in 2016; current junior Adam Fox earned gold in 2017 and bronze in 2018 as an alternate captain on the blue line for team USA. Drury hopes to continue his collegiate program’s recent streak of WJC performers.
“Growing up, I woke up early for some of the games to watch,” Fox recalled. “You never really thought of being a part of [the World Junior Championship], but when I got that opportunity, it was unbelievable. Being in Montréal my first year, playing in front of that huge crowd for the gold medal, it was definitely special. And being able to wear a letter, too, it was obviously a huge honor.”
The World Junior Championship is the grandest stage for junior hockey players worldwide. In the past three years, numerous alumni of the USA team have graduated to stardom in the National Hockey League, including Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, and Zach Werenski.
This year’s American squad, featuring seven NHL first-round draft choices and the presumed No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft, Jack Hughes, promises to contend for gold. Drury is well aware of the unique opportunity in front of him.
“For any hockey player, it’s a tournament you’ve been watching since you were a little kid,” Drury said. “I can remember watching 2010 when [team USA] won the gold, and 2013 and 2017. It’s a really exciting tournament, and within the hockey world it’s one that people love so much that it certainly makes it a special experience.”
Drury’s uncle, Chris, skated for the Americans in the 1996 World Junior Championship before a successful NHL career featuring a Stanley Cup victory and three Olympic appearances. His father, Ted ’93, also has history with USA Hockey, playing in two World Junior Championships — captaining the squad in his second year — and competing in two Olympic Games.
In this year’s iteration of the tournament, the United States will play in Group B along with Slovakia, Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Finland. In 2018, the Swedes knocked off team USA in the semifinals before falling to Canada in the championship game.
Drury hopes to ride his success through 11 NCAA games this season (4–8—12), in which he has pivoted the Crimson’s most effective forward trio, to a prominent role in the 2019 tournament roster as it looks to medal for a fourth consecutive year. The forward ranks third in the nation in points per game (1.09) among freshmen and thus far has answered any outside concerns about a young attacking unit replacing lost scoring from last season.
“He brings a lot of smarts down the middle,” Fox said of his rookie teammate. “He’s been productive for us, even though he’s a freshman. He has a good impact on the game, just emotionally and with his energy. He’s definitely good for us.”
If Drury does earn a final spot in the forward ranks, he will begin tournament action against Slovakia (Dec. 26, 6:30 p.m. EST). The Americans then take on Kazakhstan (Dec. 28, 10:30 p.m.), Sweden (Dec. 29, 10:30 p.m.), and Finland (Dec. 31, 10:30 p.m.) to conclude the group stage before knockout play begins on Jan. 2.
For now, Jack Drury is one step closer to being a part of the Americans’ quest for gold on junior hockey’s premier international stage.

You thought coming up with a topic for your 10 page expos paper was hard? Try coming up with a topic for an entire thesis. For all you poor souls out there who are scrambling for thesis ideas, we dug through the archives to remind you that not everyone comes up with the most “serious” thesis titles — and apparently, that’s okay. Because these examples literally won prizes.
Give Me Burning. 
No context. Is “Burning” a thing, a person, or a place? Can you give someone the action of burning? Titles are supposed to preface the topic of the whole thesis, but we have so many questions and so few answers.
Clickbait. 
Ah, clickbait. We love it. We hate it. YouTubers can’t live without it. This thesis has no further explanation in the title; it’s just titled “Clickbait.” If that’s not the literal definition of thesis clickbait, then we don’t know what is.
Can You Just Not.
Can we not? We’re not sure what this thesis is even about, but we had to put it in here just to show how much you can get away with when writing your thesis. Title it whatever your heart desires. Or you can just not.
Vanitas: The Harvard Indifference Epidemic and the Mysterious Med. Fac. Society, 1818-1905. 
We love a play on veritas. We think it’s veri-clever. But Harvard students? Vain and indifferent? We could never, but apparently someone spent an entire year writing about the epidemic of Harvard students’ indifference. Whatever.
Drop Out Like It's Hot: Analyzing the Impact of State-Level Legislation on School Completion Rates
We can tell this was written recently. Puns are definitely the best way to title a thesis that only a handful of people will end up reading. Might as well make it funny.
According to these incredible thesis titles, nothing is off-limits when it comes to writing and titling a senior thesis. You don’t even have to give context. Have fun seniors, and if you don’t, remember you can always drop out like it’s hot ;)
