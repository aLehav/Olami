After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing the case of undocumented student Eric Balderas '13, the Cambridge City Council passed a resolution Monday calling upon the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to halt the removal of immigrant students.
At its first meeting since late June, the Council showed its support for the passage of the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act—a piece of legislation that would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon completing two years of higher education toward a degree or two years of military service—or similar immigration reform.
The resolution was authored by Harvard Divinity School student Christopher C. Hope, who also serves as a minister at the Pentecostal Tabernacle in Cambridge and a human rights commissioner.
Though Balderas' name appeared in the resolution—on behalf of which several undocumented youth spoke during the meeting—the rising Harvard sophomore was not present at Monday's gathering.
In early June, Balderas tried to board a plane from San Antonio, Texas to Boston in June with his Mexican consulate card and Harvard identification, prompting the attention of immigration officials who soon discovered Balderas' undocumented status. He faced possible deportation to Mexico, but was ultimately permitted to stay indefinitely.
Balderas could not provide comment because he has been advised to not speak with the press.
"These are young immigrants who come to our congregation...to ask for prayers to be allowed to stay in this country to continue their education," Hope said at the City Council meeting. "For them, this great nation has been everything they've known."
What began as a sultry and delayed start to the special Cambridge City Council meeting yesterday dragged into the cool late night with a couple of lengthy recesses and an audience that gradually petered out.
For two hours during the public comment session, Cambridge citizens and affiliates approached the stand to draw attention to other agenda issues such as increasing the parking permit price and allowing abutting neighbors to raise chickens and ducks in their back yard.
The illegal immigration presentations were woven in with dissenters of the city manager agenda item of seeking other barriers to allowing Cambridge residents to have chickens and ducks in their back yard—which one speaker as "undocumented chickens."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management  Company is exploring options for unloading several of its real estate investments to China's $300 billion sovereign wealth fund, a  move that could represent a significant change from an investment  strategy that had stressed diversity of holdings before the recession  struck. 
According to a Wall Street Journal report, China Investment  Corp., or CIC, recently approached the University’s money managers about  a possible purchase of Harvard's positions in six real estate funds.  The mammoth sovereign wealth fund, whose management and board of  directors report to the Chinese central government, appears to be  attempting to take advantage of persistently depressed real estate  values.
  
In previous years, sovereign wealth funds' efforts to enter the   U.S. real estate market via direct investments in properties have  often  met with public outcry and political impasses, but CIC's purchase  into  real estate funds may attract less scrutiny. 
  
For HMC, a sale would represent a retreat from a sector that has suffered greatly during the recession. It comes just over one year after HMC reported a 50 percent loss on its real estate holdings in fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2009, HMC’s investments in “real assets”—a category that includes both real estate and commodities—fell by some $2.4 billion to $5.6 billion.
Harvard spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment, citing University policy not to discuss investments.
 
Harvard’s annual report for fiscal 2009 admitted that diverse  holdings had not allowed the University to emerge from the financial  crisis unscathed.
 
“While diversification has been a mainstay and a driver of the  portfolio’s return over the long-term, the benefits of diversification  did not bear out through the rapidly evolving and widespread events that  unfolded in fiscal 2009,” the report stated.
 
HMC measures its performance against a theoretical “policy  portfolio” allocated to various “asset classes,” chosen to give the  University an appropriate level of risk. Since 1995, the portfolio has  shifted away from domestic equities—then 38 percent of Harvard’s  holdings—into more exotic assets including commodities and, to a lesser  degree, real estate.
 
Though the policy portfolio remained unchanged, SEC filings in  the fourth quarter of 2009 showed HMC moving back into the domestic  stock market, though Harvard’s money managers moved away from the market  again in the first quarter of 2010.
Last April, HMC announced a new managing director of real estate  investments, after the position had remained vacant for over a year. The  appointment of Daniel W. Cummings, a former managing director at  private equity titan The Carlyle Group, came at a time when University  officials scrambled to adjust budgets to accommodate a projected 30  percent drop in the endowment for the fiscal year.

The Cambridge Public School Committee pushed through a joint motion yesterday calling for the use of locally grown food and encouraging progress reports that assess the environmental impact of the policy goal.
Though Cambridge public schools have taken great strides in recent years toward a healthier and more sustainable district, "locally sourced food is an issue which has the potential to be healthier and more environmentally sustainable," stated the motion, which was penned by members Richard Harding and Patricia M. Nolan.
Members of the school committee said that they hope the policy goal will help Cambridge to grow more economically self-sufficient  by supporting local businesses.
 
 
Cambridge is already equipped with the resources to tackle the new policy goal, and the motion's passage will now encourage members to "think about the local economy" and take action, said Harding, who also runs the Men of Color Health Initiative. A new policy, he hopes, will help the school committee establish a baseline and examine areas where improvement can be made.
Before the recommendation was made at the committee meeting, Nicola S. Williams—a member of the board of Sustainable Business Network of Greater Boston—rose for a public comment, encouraging a policy that promotes accountability for institutions that could better utilize locally grown food, and calling for the clear identification of such foods in schools and markets.
 
“We need a concrete goal with numbers,” said Williams, who is also involved in the Boston Local Food Festival event. “It’s probably going to take a year because the food bids have already been placed, but there can be some movement toward local foods.”
 
 
 
School committee member Alfred B. Fantini said that Cambridge "can be proud," for it has consistently prioritized healthy eating in recent years.
“We have valued nutrition for our children for a long time,” Fantini added. “We have long known that this links to academic success…We are a national model in this area."

Throw together a new head coach, two new captains, and 10 incoming freshmen and you get a Harvard men’s lacrosse team with a very new look.
A new look might be just what the Crimson needs after a statistically disappointing 2010 campaign. Entering last season ranked No. 12 in the nation and boasting the third-ranked recruiting class in the country, Harvard faltered in conference play, finishing 2-4 in the Ivy League.
After the unexpected departure of third-year head coach John Tillman in June to take the Maryland head coaching position, first-year Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96, along with new co-captains Dean Gibbons and junior Kevin Vaughan, hope to keep the team moving in the right direction.
Wojcik—a former Harvard soccer and lacrosse standout—took the first step in that direction earlier today by announcing the team’s incoming freshman class. While this year’s class may not boast a standout individual player, its depth should be a great asset to the Crimson, according to Geoff Shannon, associate editor of Inside Lacrosse.
“This class is probably deeper across the board,” Shannon said. “In the last couple of classes, they’ve had one superstar. I don’t know if this class has that guy, per se, but they have guys [that can contribute].”
Three players Shannon expects to make an impact as soon as they step onto the turf at Harvard Stadium are defenseman John Rose, midfielder Eric Slingerland, and attackman Carl Zimmerman—three Under Armour All-Americans.
“Those are your three stars,” Shannon said.
While in high school, Rose anchored the defense for Deerfield Academy, a team that spent time ranked No. 1 in the country during his senior season. Along the way, Rose picked up three All-New England nods.
“[Rose is] up-tempo—he can push the ball,” Shannon said. “But he is a lockdown defender as well.”
Slingerland is expected to aid the Crimson’s midfield, which claims just six upperclassmen at the position. Slingerland, who reportedly boasts a strong shooting touch, should help Harvard offensively. While at Phillips Exeter Academy, the new Crimson asset notched a school record for most career points by a midfielder with 154.
Zimmerman should also add some pop to Harvard’s offense. The six-foot attacker described by Shannon as a “strong athlete” set a school record at Homer High School (N.Y.) with 188 goals and 267 points.
“Zimmerman could really come in there and work with [Jeff Cohen] and be effective,” Shannon said.
The Crimson’s latest class is rounded out by an additional three midfielders, two defenders, one attackman, and one goalkeeper.

It's August, and you know what that means: football season is only one month away. It’s time to start preparing your fantasy football cheat sheets, firing up the grill, and dusting off the old Harvard varsity sweater. The Crimson opens its season against Holy Cross on September 18 under the lights at Harvard Stadium. Sure, that’s 45 days away, but Around the Water Cooler, it's never too early to start discussing Ivy League football—especially when the other option is to talk about the Ivy League’s incoming track and field classes.
It’s hard to believe, but over at Cornell there are apparently other sports played besides basketball. Dempsey Quinn, a senior safety on the Big Red’s football squad, was recently named to the FCS Senior Scout Bowl preseason All-America second team. Last season, Quinn finished with 92 tackles, three forced fumbles, and an interception.
But Quinn wasn’t the only Ivy Leaguer named to the All-America team. Harvard’s own safety—captain Collin Zych—was selected to the FCS Senior Scout Bowl preseason All-America first team. Granted, if Cornell basketball God Ryan Wittman had decided to play football, we all know he would have beaten out Zych for that first team spot.
Joining Zych on the first team are Princeton linebacker Steve Cody and Dartmouth defensive end Charles Bay. It’s interesting to note that not a single offensive player from the Ancient Eight made either the first or second teams. It looks like Ivy League football fans should start getting ready for some defensive battles.
Speaking of football, Dartmouth fans hope that the announcement of its new athletic director could help the football program begin moving in the right direction after last season’s 2-8 finish. Harry Sheehy, who previously served as Williams College’s chair and director of athletics, physical education and recreation, will take over the Big Green’s athletic department on September 7. But Sheehy—who coached the Ephs’ basketball team for 17 seasons—might do more help for the Dartmouth on the hardwood. But that’s not to say the Big Green doesn't need help there as well, as Dartmouth finished last season 1-13 in conference play.
Rounding out this week’s edition is some news out of Brown. Bears lacrosse player Paris Waterman was selected to the 2010-11 U.S. National team earlier this week. Waterman and her 35 teammates could form the nucleus of the United States team that competes at the World Cup in 2013.

Perhaps asking you to leave campus to attend events was crossing the line. Maybe the arts exhibitions were not worth the T-ride. So we have another event for you, one that’s right here on campus and involves free food—locally grown, organic free food!
Today at 4 p.m., all community members are invited to attend a live cooking demonstration by Director of Culinary Operations, Martin T. Breslin, who will use ingredients from the Community Garden itself.
If you haven’t noticed, the Community Garden has been around in front of Lowell House since the spring and, according to summer intern Emily E. Osborne '12, it aims to increase awareness of food issues and provide an anchor point where people can link food and the realities of its production, even in an urban environment like Cambridge.
“People should come to see the Garden up close if they haven’t before, to show support for the Garden and its mission, to enjoy the relaxing setting, to share their thoughts on the garden specifically and sustainability or food-related issues in general and maybe even to learn something new!” Osborne said.
The Garden has been growing lettuce, onions, peppers, radishes, tomatoes, kale, eggplants, etc…an exhaustive ingredient list for some delicious recipes. If you want to find out what’s on the menu, go to the community garden today between 4-6 p.m.
