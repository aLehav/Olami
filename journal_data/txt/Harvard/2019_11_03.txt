Software engineer Ilan Levy said he developed an interest in politics when he moved to Cambridge 18 years ago. Now, he is one of 22 candidates running for Cambridge City Council in an election Nov. 5.
Levy said that he got involved in the city soon after moving to Cambridge from Belgium nearly two decades ago.
“We purchased a house, I got involved in a neighborhood organization and the first few years we did a lot of positive things,” Levy said.
He pointed to contract zoning policies and police brutality as issues that contributed to his passion for public service.
“I got involved with Mass. Action Against Police Brutality…and at one of the protests I got arrested,” Levy said. “There was quite a presence of police power and I figured that any system that requires that much violence in order to maintain itself must be wrong and…that’s why I’m doing politics and being involved.”
Levy said his main concern with Cambridge politics is the way the local government is run. Specifically, he said he disapproves of Cambridge’s Plan E Charter. Levy contends that the Plan E system structures the city government much like a business, which he said impedes progress on social issues.
“It’s a very biased system to a certain outcome and that outcome is financial and financial only because we’re a corporation making money,” Levy said.
Levy cited a Kendall Square electrical substation as an example of a product of the Plan E system.
“Ten years after an aggressive pursuit of contract zoning, we’re in a situation now that we can’t provide the electricity to Kendall Square and...we have to create a huge, massive, electric substation,” Levy said. “It is going to be supplying only the density of Kendall Square and the health effects and hazard because it can be a building that can be as high as 150 feet tall.”
Levy unsuccessfully ran for Cambridge City Council in 2015 and 2017. Comparing his experience with the past two elections, he said he believes this upcoming election is particularly worrisome.
“What’s different in this election compared to the others and more worrisome actually than ever before is that we are very aware now of the crisis we are in and despite our awareness we still keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again,” Levy said. “We basically talk, talk, talk, talk and when it comes to action we do what we always have done.”
Levy closed with a call for Harvard students to get more involved with local politics. He called it “shameful” that more students aren’t involved in municipal government issues.
“I know there is a lot of activism at the University, but I find it very unfortunate that that activism doesn’t expand into the city and into the neighborhoods so that there is a better understanding of what exactly politics is about and how local politics in particular can be the one place where we can start making a real difference,” he said.

Cambridge City Councilor Alanna M. Mallon is running for re-election following her first term in office on a platform that features housing affordability and providing support for Cambridge families.
As a councilor, Mallon has worked to pass initiatives to provide more opportunities for Cambridge residents to join the workforce and address concerns of food and housing insecurity, she said in an interview last week.
“I wanted to make sure that as a city we were directing our vast resources to our most vulnerable in our community because to me that’s a critical need,” Mallon said. “If you want a healthy community, you have to have healthy kids and families.”
During her time in office, Mallon worked to revitalize a police department cadet program, which allows kids to be employed and mentored by members of the Cambridge Police Department. She also cited her collaboration with MIT and the Metro Building Trade Council to bring Building Pathways — a six week pre-apprenticeship program for the building trades — to Cambridge.
Mallon said that, moving forward, she hopes to continue her work on housing, which she views to be a key issue. She said she is concerned about the availability of low-income housing and the rate at which renters are being displaced.
“I think the issue of housing is the defining issue of our time right now — not just affordable housing for our low income residents but for our middle income residents and our renters,” Mallon said.
In the past, Mallon has worked with city administrators to keep tenants in place in Cambridge.
“The city has been doing a really good job of, with the City Council, figuring out where we can direct our funding most urgently to protect affordable units and decrease the eviction rate,” Mallon said.
Prior to her time on the City Council, Mallon worked as a clothing designer before turning her focus to non-profit work.
Mallon founded the Cambridge Weekend Backpack Program during the 2012-2013 school year to improve food security for Cambridge students by sending food home on weekends with those who relied on school meals during the week. Her work with the Backpack Program led her to serve as the city’s education liaison for former Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher.
Mallon said her non-profit work inspired her campaign for City Council.
“I ran in 2017 because I thought I could pack backpacks full of food for the rest of my life, or I could run for office and work on those underlying issues of why kids are hungry,” she said.
Mallon currently works for Food For Free, a non-profit organization that delivers healthy meals to vulnerable populations in Cambridge and Boston.
Ryan Lee, the operations director for Food For Free, said Mallon’s work with the organization is emblematic of her prior service to Cambridge.
“It’s an extension of what she’s been doing in Cambridge for a long time,” Lee said. “She’s always been out there listening to folks in Cambridge. Before they were her neighbors, and now they’re her constituents.”
Mallon said that her greatest strength lies in her willingness to do “painstaking” work to solve difficult issues for Cambridge residents.
“We don’t need more people on Monday nights who are just creating policy orders for big stories,” she said. “We need people who are going to be doing that work behind the scenes and bringing people together, and I do that.”

Cambridge resident and teacher Ben T. Simon declared his inaugural candidacy for Cambridge City Council earlier this year, running to advocate for rent control and against corporate development.
Simon said he is seeking to join the City Council on a platform aimed at combating gentrification and the displacement of low-income residents. The average rent for an apartment in Cambridge has seen an average annual increase of five percent over the past five years, making it one of the most expensive places to rent on the East Coast, according to RentCafe.
Simon added that increasing rent prices, fueled by development and lack of rent control, drive out low-income people from Cambridge in order to support new higher-income residents.
“What development ends up meaning in many contexts is just development for some at the exclusion of others,” he said.
Simon credited his personal experience with displacement for fostering his interest in public service. He spent his childhood in Porter Square, at a time when rent control capped Cambridge housing costs. After a statewide referendum in 1994 banned rent control, Simon said his family had to move to the Midwest due to “skyrocketing” rents.
“When we were uprooted from our community like that, it shaped my whole view of reality of how cities work and of how unfair cities frequently are,” he said.
If he is elected to the City Council Nov. 5, Simon said his long-term goals are to end displacement and homelessness in Cambridge.
“It’s not entirely clear to me how we get there, but rent control and social housing are definitely tools to get to that goal,” Simon said.
As part of his mission to represent lower-income residents, Simon has pledged to only take home as much of his city councilor salary as he currently makes working as an after-school teacher.
“If I take a huge pay raise, I’m suddenly not in their shoes. I’m no longer low-income. It’s hard to represent people when you’re not in their shoes,” Simon said.
He added that he will use the remainder of his paycheck to promote community organizing efforts.
Simon said that he also supports policies aimed at making the public more engaged in city policy and preventing large corporations from influencing elected officials.
“I’m a socialist. I think capitalism is a fundamentally immoral, broken economic system. Under capitalism, democracy never really works. Elected representatives are not powerful but rather playthings of the powerful,” Simon said.
Simon also said he sees faults within higher education institutions in Cambridge, which he views as drivers of rising housing costs in the city.
“We need to be asking Harvard and MIT for a lot more in taxes especially because their presence, in large part, is what is driving gentrification and displacement,” Simon said.
He also said he hopes to see an increase in student pressure on university administrators to pay local taxes, citing Harvard students’ past involvement in advocating for rent control.
“I hope that some Harvard students are jazzed up about Harvard doing more to help Cambridge in terms of paying more taxes. It’s very likely it can’t happen without Harvard students’ help,” Simon remarked.
MIT spokesperson Sarah E. Gallop cited the university’s Town-Gown report in response to criticisms of their tax payments leveled by several City Council candidates.
“MIT is actually the largest taxpayer in Cambridge by a long shot,” Gallop said. “We pay taxes on all our commercial property and offer payment in lieu of taxes on all our academic property.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not comment on elections or individual candidates. She directed The Crimson to previous statements about Harvard’s contributions to the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program.
“Harvard has a long tradition of paying taxes and making voluntary PILOT payments to its host communities. During the last fiscal year, Harvard paid more than $4 million in a voluntary PILOT payment, as well as more than $6 million in taxes to the City of Cambridge,” O’Rourke has previously written.

Cambridge City Councilor and former mayor E. Denise Simmons is tackling affordable housing, civic unity, worker support, public safety, and education in her campaign for a tenth term on the council.
Simmons has spent the past several decades in Cambridge government, serving two terms as mayor and nine as a councilor. She currently serves as the chair of the Civic Unity Committee and co-chair of the Housing Committee. Earlier this fall, she received an approval rating of 40.7 percent among Cambridge residents, second only to Mayor Marc C. McGovern, according to an Emerson College poll.
A lifelong resident of Cambridge, Simmons has witnessed the issue of affordable housing many of her constituents struggle with, according to a statement to Cambridge Civic.
“I have learned many important things about this process just by virtue of doing the work so often,” Simmons wrote.
Simmons did not agree to be interviewed for this article.
In April 2018, Simmons co-sponsored a policy order that budgeted $100 million for affordable housing over the next five years. She also developed an Affordable Housing Search Guide and has led efforts to pass a proposed 100 percent affordable housing overlay. The overlay, which has proved controversial among candidates in the 2019 municipal election, would allow developers to more easily acquire permission to build affordable housing in Cambridge.
After a city council hearing in July 2019, Simmons told The Crimson that she was concerned people might try to “trivialize” the issue of affordable housing in Cambridge.
“This is where people are going to live, where they are going to raise their children, where they're going to make their memories. It's their home,” Simmons said at the time.
Simmons — who was the nation’s first African American, openly lesbian mayor and Massachusetts’ first African American female mayor — wrote to Cambridge Civic that she prioritizes fairness and diversity, and hopes to push for more inclusion in city employment going forward.
“Cambridge prides itself in being a beacon of tolerance and a community that draws strength from its great diversity,” Simmons wrote to Cambridge Civic. “The City, as an employer, must also adhere to those ideals, and I certainly hope to be leading these most important discussions and meetings in the coming year.”
Simmons, who owns Cambridgeport Insurance Agency, also wrote to Cambridge Civic that she is dedicated to fostering a local economy through supporting local business owners and employers. She has long backed “green collar” jobs, those that are well-paying and environmentally sustainable.
Simmons wrote to Cambridge Civic that one of her “proudest achievements” over her career in city government has been bridging her commitment to growing local businesses and her care for future generations. During her first term as mayor, she helped create the Girls Only Leadership Development Program, which connects eighth grade girls from across Cambridge with mentors in various careers including business and politics to discuss college readiness and jobs.
“I care very much about what kind of city we’ll be leaving to our grandchildren, and to our grandchildren's children,” Simmons wrote.

Long-time Cambridge resident and environmental activist John R. Pitkin has centered his campaign for Cambridge City Council around combating climate change and encouraging citizen participation, issues that have garnered increased attention among residents in recent years.
This year’s election marks Pitkin’s third attempt at securing a position on the city council, following his previous campaigns in 2001 and 2003.
Pitkin said he thinks the surest road to environmental sustainability is getting Cambridge residents more involved in civic affairs.
“If this city, which certainly has something to do with climate change and the environment, isn’t working and if people want to do more than the city government’s doing, the best thing I can do about climate change is to get our government to work,” Pitkin said in an interview Tuesday. “The people are the head of the government, so making it more democratic will lead to more action.”
Born in New York City, Pitkin earned degrees from Columbia University and Oxford University. He currently works as a demographer conducting research on population change and immigration in the United States. As part of his professional work, Pitkin also serves as a consultant for university research groups. Pitkin and his wife have lived near Inman Square for nearly 50 years, where they raised two daughters.
Pitkin first entered Cambridge city affairs in the wake of a transportation crisis in 1972, when he chaired the Cambridge Transportation Forum. That forum offered citizens the opportunity to participate in planning city transportation, something Pitkin hopes to expand today.
As president of the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association, Pitkin said he has attempted to regain control over rapid commercial growth, a struggle that culminated in his initial 2001 campaign for City Council.
While still deeply invested in issues of transportation and development, Pitkin said climate change has since become one of his highest priorities.
“My grandchildren were just born,” he said. “I was concerned about them so I said, ‘I’ll become a full-time environmental activist.’”
Pitkin said he helped organize two climate congresses hosted in Cambridge City Hall and “pushed the city to take more concrete action” against climate change in 2009.
Pitkin also said he would hope to address traffic congestion and infrastructure in Cambridge, caused by growth in both jobs and population. He said he wants to reestablish a forum similar to the one he previously led, where citizens can voice concerns and suggestions regarding transportation.
“Too much of what’s being proposed is top-down,” he said. “When you’re making big decisions you need to know that the people support them.”
Pitkin acknowledged that while Harvard is “trying to be a good neighbor,” some problems the city currently faces — notably in transportation, housing, and environmental sustainability — call for further action on the University’s part.
“I think the University should be paying much more to the city in lieu of taxes,” Pitkin said. “We ought to be pressing the University to do more. But how do you run a democracy when you’ve got 100,000 citizens and then you have a world class university as a citizen? How do you balance that? It’s difficult.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not comment on statements from individual candidates, but referred The Crimson to previous statements.
“As a reliable and engaged partner, the University seeks to strike a thoughtful balance between taxes, PILOT, and mission driven community programs that are a meaningful extension of Harvard’s education and research mission and reflect years of collaboration between the University, its neighbors, and city partners,” O’Rourke wrote.

For incumbent Cambridge City Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, Cambridge’s challenges with affordable housing hit close to home. Siddiqui, who moved to Cambridge from Pakistan when she was two years old, grew up living in affordable housing with her family and attended Cambridge Public Schools through high school.
Siddiqui said her own childhood experiences give her a unique perspective among the 22 candidates running for city council this year.
“I’m the only one who’s running who has grown up in Cambridge affordable housing. I think that’s a big part, having that depth of experience,” she said.
Throughout her childhood, Siddiqui also participated in civic engagement efforts — namely co-founding the Cambridge Youth Council, a still-active platform for high school students to conduct community projects. She studied public policy as an undergraduate at Brown University and, after earning a law degree at Northwestern University, worked as an attorney at Northeast Legal Aid, providing legal services for low-income Massachusetts residents.
“I offer my lifelong experiences as a Cambridge resident; I’ve grown up in Cambridge affordable housing and I offer a unique legal background that’s committed to the public interest,” Siddiqui said. “So, you’re electing someone who knows the community and also has experience with constituent services and working on policy.”
Seeking reelection for a second term, Siddiqui said she experienced a steep learning curve throughout her first term as a Cambridge City Council member.
“It’s a huge learning curve, and I’ve learned it’s okay to kind of not know anything and to take your time researching and doing your due diligence, and that it’s okay not to have made up your mind on things right away and be open,” she said.
In her first term, Siddiqui worked on various initiatives in her first term, including working to establish the Mayor’s Blue Ribbon Task Force on Tenant Displacement that plans to investigate the causes of forced displacement in Cambridge, as well as Cambridge Digs DEEP, a series of Cambridge community conversations organized with the Disruptive Equity Education Project.
Siddiqui has also sponsored legislation that focuses on establishing economic opportunities for historically marginalized groups, including introducing a provision for a two-year moratorium on opening recreational marijuana shops whose owners do not qualify as “economic empowerment” and “social equity” applicants. Though some councilors did not agree with Siddiqui’s proposal, the legislation ultimately passed 7-0 through the council.
Siddiqui said her priorities for her second term if she is reelected are primarily to implement recommendations from the Tenant Displacement task force, including working to provide stronger tenant protections. She also said it was important to ensure inclusion in public spaces across the city, including bringing halal food to schools.
Siddiqui said that she would also like to expand her work on sustainability and pedestrian and biker safety in Cambridge. Earlier this fall, a pedestrian was killed crossing the street outside a crosswalk in Harvard Square. Pedestrian safety — and calls to transition the Square into a pedestrian-only space — have become more urgent in the wake of the accident.

Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, a first-time candidate for Cambridge City Council, hopes to bring his experience as a renter and community advocate to the local government this election season.
Sobrinho-Wheeler is one of 22 candidates vying for nine seats on the City Council. He works at the Lincoln Institute, a land policy nonprofit in Cambridge that focuses on community development and urban planning, and volunteers for the Boston Democratic Socialists of America and the Boston Sunrise Movement, an environmental activism group
Sobrinho-Wheeler said the city council today does not reflect the demographics of Cambridge when it comes to housing prices, a perspective that he said he would be able to bring as a renter.
“I’m a renter because I can’t afford to buy a home in Cambridge, and two-thirds of Cambridge are renters,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “We have hardly any renters on the City Council.”
Sobrinho-Wheeler pointed to housing reform and affordability as key issues for his campaign.
Mass. State Representative Mike Connolly, who has worked with Sobrinho-Wheeler on “several housing issues,” has endorsed him for the City Council.
“I just think he brings a real perspective of housing justice and of equity to the conversation around affordable housing in Cambridge,” Connolly said in an interview.
Sobrinho-Wheeler also said he is pitching voters on an integrated approach to environmental and economic policies, noting that these issues tend to disproportionately affect lower-income individuals.
“Folks who are going to be most impacted by climate change are the same folks whom our economy is failing and, you know, are dealing with a legacy of structural racism,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “We should be thinking about climate change and economic inequality and racial inequity holistically.”
Sobrinho-Wheeler also discussed the relationship between the city and its educational institutions, in light of Harvard’s graduate student union recently voting to authorize its strike. In particular, he advocated for
“These universities we have here, they should also be paying their students, their adjunct staff, [and] their cafeteria workers decent wages and health care,” he said. “That includes grad students, and we should be pushing for that as a city council.”
“Harvard and MIT both pay for PILOTs, payments in lieu of taxes, and they’re far less than what they should be paying,” he added.
Sarah E. Gallop, Co-Director of Government and Community Relations at MIT, said that MIT makes significant tax contributions to the city.
“MIT is actually the largest taxpayer in Cambridge by a long shot,” Gallop said. “We pay taxes on all our commercial property and offer payment in lieu of taxes on all our academic property.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not comment on elections or individual candidates. She directed The Crimson to previous statements about Harvard’s contributions to the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program.
“Harvard has a long tradition of paying taxes and making voluntary PILOT payments to its host communities. During the last fiscal year, Harvard paid more than $4 million in a voluntary PILOT payment, as well as more than $6 million in taxes to the City of Cambridge,” O’Rourke has previously written.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said he has also worked to run a grassroots campaign as a way to garner support from those who do not typically vote in City Council elections.
“Those folks are more likely to be renters, younger people, lower-income folks,” he said. “If we could turn out a few more of those people, we can reshape politics in the city.”

As 22 candidates vie for election to the Cambridge City Council, Mayor Marc C. McGovern insists that he’s one of the few able to deliver on his campaign promises, pointing to his track record in office thus far.
McGovern, who has served as mayor of Cambridge since 2017, is one of eight incumbents running for City Council. He cites the legal defense fund for immigrants in the city and the free breakfast program for students in Cambridge public schools as two of his greatest accomplishments as mayor. If elected Nov. 5, McGovern will start his fourth term on the council.
McGovern said the primary focus for his campaign is the affordable housing crisis in Cambridge. Though thousands of new job opportunities have opened up in the Boston metropolitan area in the last few years, Cambridge’s housing market has largely not kept up, according to McGovern. Many low-income and homeless individuals cannot access the housing market, and many middle-income Cambridge residents do not qualify for vouchers or subsidies and are pushed out of the city.
McGovern plans to not only build more affordable housing and provide vouchers to low- and middle-income Cambridge residents, but also assess the root causes of housing instability.
“We're surrounded by all this prosperity, but we have a higher poverty rate than the state average,” said McGovern.
He said he will examine job training, salaries, and wages so that Cambridge residents who enter the job market will be able to experience the upward mobility required to stay here. McGovern said he will also address the issue of no-cause evictions so that tenants can have more stability within the market. In some cases, landlords evict their tenants so that they can sell their apartments or raise rents in a very competitive housing market.
Though many other candidates have made affordable housing a central platform in their campaigns, McGovern said the best way to differentiate between candidates it to look at their past accomplishments.
“We're all talking about similar things, but I think you have to look at people's records,” he said. “There's a lot of talk in politics and sometimes there's not enough action. We take concrete action to get results.”
McGovern said he has already taken steps to improve the lives of local residents. In addition to the free breakfast program and the legal defense fund — which aids immigrants in getting legal representation — McGovern has created programs to combat homelessness.
“When homelessness increased in Cambridge, what did we do? We opened a warming center for the homeless and we started a program to help homeless people obtain their vital records like birth certificates and social security cards, which are often obstacles to them getting into housing.”
McGovern has largely focused on direct voter outreach and contact in the last few weeks leading up to the election. He said his team has knocked on more than 10,000 doors and made thousands of phone calls.
“Really trying to establish that grassroots person-to-person connection is really important,” he said.
Explaining the proportional, ranked-choice voting system is a challenge his campaign team faces, according to McGovern. In Cambridge, voters rank their chosen candidates in order of preference. McGovern said he has met people who believe he already has broad enough support to be reelected and subsequently vote for another candidate as their number one choice.
Some voters also do not understand that the incumbent mayor must run for council and then be elected by the other councilors to the mayorship, according to McGovern.
Above all, McGovern said his deep love of Cambridge drives his service to the city.
“This city has given so much to my family and me, and that’s why I continue to do this work.”

Nicola Williams — a Jamaican immigrant, local business owner, and activist — began her local advocacy more than 20 years ago on an anti-smoking campaign, but this year she’s looking to take her city involvement a step further: running for Cambridge City Council.
Williams is running on a platform focused on affordable housing, an issue that has impacted her throughout her 31 years in Cambridge and that remains as salient as ever for local residents today.
“I lived in a rent-control unit 25 years ago — where I am now— in Harvard Square, and my rents increased by 50 percent,” she said. “I get the analysis and organize my building.”
Williams eventually realized that it was cheaper if the building’s tenants purchased the structure instead of renting apartments. She convinced her neighbors to take that step and alleviate some of their financial burden.
Still, she said the city of Cambridge has not prioritized housing reforms that help all its residents.
“I’m very concerned that we’ve become a city of have and have nots,” Williams said. “There’s not an opportunity for many people given the policies or the lack of policies of good housing in our cities.”
Williams said that the city’s current affordable housing proposal fail to sufficiently address residents’ needs. She has, for example, opposed the city’s 100 percent affordable housing overlay plan.
“The housing policies they're coming out are perpetuating poverty and keeping poor people poor,” she said. “It’s not giving an opportunity for people to transition to be homeowners, so that their housing can be stabilized.”
Williams also said it is critical for Cambridge to provide universal pre-kindergarten options, as opposed to the city’s current system, which she called unaffordable to some residents.
Williams has received endorsements from local groups including Our Revolution Cambridge and the Harvard College Democrats.
Sean McFarland, a coordinating committee member for Our Revolution Cambridge, wrote in an email that the group endorsed Williams because of her reputation for supporting her neighbors and pursuing advocacy work in Cambridge.
“Williams is a true Cambridge treasure, and by choosing to step up and run, she's given us a one of a kind chance to vote for someone of her caliber and unique perspective to join our city council,” he said. “I've heard nothing but good things from the many neighbors whose lives she has touched and her passion for re-aligning city government with its intended purpose of serving ‘we the people’ would be a tremendous asset for current and future Cambridge residents alike.”
The Harvard College Democrats chose Williams as their sole city council endorsement for the 2019 election in October. The College Democrats declined to comment on their endorsement.
Williams said that, ultimately, she hopes her advocacy record will help woo voters come Tuesday.
“I'm results driven. I've proven myself in my work. Out of all the existing and potential candidates, I'm the one who has created the most jobs, and I truly am committed and believe in this,” she said. “I care about my community and I’ve invested a lot of time in this community. And I'm willing to continue to do that for Cambridge for all.”

Cambridge City Council candidate Risa Mednick is the former executive director of a domestic violence prevention group and has never run for political office before — but she believes her experience working with city officials positions her uniquely among ths year’s field of challengers
For the past ten years, Mednick has been the executive director of Transition House, an organization that offered the first shelter for domestic violence victims on the East Coast. She said in an interview that her leadership experience qualifies her for the City Council race and has shaped her platform, which centers around bringing more equity to the city.
“As a non-incumbent, I am the only one who has demonstrated collaboration and effective policy work with the council, with the [City] Manager, and with the City of Cambridge,” Mednick said.
Mednick said she plans to center her campaign around issues of inequity, racism, homelessness, and the rising costs of rent and housing.
“I think we live in challenging times and that the current city council is not doing enough,” Mednick said. “I think that we are systematically not addressing racism, racial bias, and inequity throughout our city.”
If elected, Mednick said she plans to put forward an “anti-bias training mechanism” to address potential biases in city leadership.
Mednick’s platform also targets Cambridge’s rising costs of living by proposing a “gap voucher” initiative. In her plan, the City Council would make Cambridge homes more affordable by paying for the costs that the city’s current affordable housing voucher does not cover.
“If the voucher covers $1,000, and the cost of rent is $1,500, then the city would offset that with a ‘gap voucher’ of $500, which would mean a family stays stably housed,” Mednick said. “That’s the kind of intervention that is feasible here.”
In addition to implementing a gap voucher program, Mednick said she intends to address the relationship between Cambridge and its institutions — including Harvard — if she is elected to the City Council.
“I think that universities need to be much better institutional citizens in terms of their contributions of [Payment in Lieu of Taxes] coming from lower taxes,” Mednick said. “The council needs to be much more assertive in shifting the dynamic between the way the city accesses and requests those PILOT payments and community benefit payments from the corporate sector.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not comment on statements from individual candidates, but referred The Crimson to previous statements about the PILOT program.
“Harvard has a long tradition of paying taxes and making voluntary PILOT payments to its host communities,” O’Rourke has written previously. “During the last fiscal year, Harvard paid more than $4 million in a voluntary PILOT payment, as well as more than $6 million in taxes to the City of Cambridge.”
Mednick said companies in Cambridge should also contribute their fair share to the city.
“Cambridge is the zip code, or several zip codes, that the institutional and corporate sector want to be in and thrive in,” she said. “And I think that there is a responsibility that comes there to contribute at a level commensurate with the benefits that are reaped by the corporate sector and the institutions.”

Recent MIT graduate Burhan Azeem, is making his first bid for Cambridge City Council this fall, focusing his campaign on affordable housing and sustainable transportation.
Azeem is the youngest candidate running for office at 22 years old, but his campaign website and social media argue his experience with housing issues and environmental research have prepared him for the role.
Born in Pakistan, Azeem came to the United States with his family when he was four. Growing up, Azeem and eleven family members lived together in a three-bedroom apartment. Azeem wrote in a Medium article that he believes his childhood experience played an important role in shaping his views on promoting affordable housing in Cambridge.
“We moved many times when I was young and it took years for us to find stable housing,” he wrote. “I understand the housing crisis on a visceral level and am devoted to fighting it.”
Azeem did not agree to be interviewed for this article.
His website also calls for greater representation of tenants in Cambridge on the council.
Beyond addressing housing issues, Azeem’s platform includes a pledge to promote sustainable housing and transportation policy if he is elected. Azeem earned a bachelor’s degree in materials science and engineering and his campaign touts his first-hand experience studying climate change at MIT as useful preparation for developing climate policy in Cambridge.
“I understand sustainability,” Azeem wrote in another Medium article. “I have built solar panels and batteries, studied the cause of our climate crisis, and took it to the heart becoming a biker and a pescatarian.”
Azeem has previously pointed to housing and transportation as ways for Cambridge to curb climate change.
“In the most direct sense, housing policy is climate policy,” Azeem said in an interview with the Tech, MIT’s student newspaper. “We need to build more housing and build it greener.”
Azeem has also called for Cambridge to invest in different types of sustainable transportation, including through improved sidewalk maintenance and increased public transit capacity.
His platform also focuses on social and economic justice, along with technological development.
Azeem told the Tech he wants to encourage civic engagement and increase youth participation in local politics. Azeem said he believes young voters will play a major role in the upcoming election.
“[Cambridge] is one of the youngest cities in the U.S., but except for one person [on City Council], almost everyone else is around age 50 or older,” he said. “It’s incredibly skewed towards this population, and it’s because young people don’t vote or get elected or run.”

As candidates for federal office debate whether to shun large-dollar donations, 71-year-old Jeffery McNary, a first-time candidate for Cambridge City Council, is going even further.
No donations. Not even a penny.
“We spread the word in the same fashion as the Federalist papers, man,” McNary said.
He poked fun at the “fancy” yard signs and literature that his campaign rivals have deployed ahead of Tuesday’s election, touting the fact that he prints his own campaign materials.
At the center of McNary’s campaign is a focus on remodeling Cambridge’s housing system. His housing proposals seem to stem from a long-held commitment to homeless individuals in the city. He said he has spent a “significant” amount of time registering homeless individuals to vote, and refers to them as his “brothers and sisters.”
“I want to get people off the street — winter is coming — and into beds and into shelters,” he said.
McNary grew up in Chicago in the 1960s. He recalls watching Martin Luther King Jr. speak on television and cited the Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael as a childhood inspiration.
After attending a preparatory seminary in the hopes of entering the Roman Catholic priesthood, McNary traveled to Northern Canada to live with the Jesuits, but was never ordained.
McNary said he moved to Cambridge to study at the Harvard Extension School, and soon after made a foray into politics as a campaign worker on Michael Dukakis’s successful re-election campaign for governor of Massachusetts.
The future presidential nominee later brought on McNary as an economic development coordinator. In that position, McNary said he co-authored an executive order to establish a Minority Economic Development Commission to facilitate investments in communities of color across the state.
“I’ve worked several campaigns,” McNary said. “But working campaigns and doing the people’s business in government are two radically different things.”
“It’s the difference between poetry and prose,” he added. “You can say anything in a campaign, but that has nothing to do with government.”
For the past seven years, McNary has worked as a freelance writer in Cambridge. His work has been published in Harvard’s Transition Magazine, along with other magazine outlets.
In his campaign for city council, McNary has offered multiple proposals for improving housing in Cambridge, including modernizing the Cambridge Housing Authority and granting it oversight of the city’s homeless shelters.
McNary seems eager to tout his connections to Harvard. A photo with Philosophy Professor Cornel West features prominently on his website, and he contends that West supports his candidacy (West did not respond to a request for comment). Two of the other photos are his website were taken on the University’s campus.
For McNary, the role of a city councilperson should ultimately be about using the office as a “pulpit” to address the smaller-scale, everyday problems that Cambridge residents face.
“I’m a nuts and bolts guy,” McNary said. “It’s not always the fancy stuff around climate change or repairing the rings of Saturn.”
“It’s about getting through the day-to-day,” he added. “It’s about vision and it’s about passion.”

Sukia Akiba, a first time candidate running for Cambridge City Council, said she plans to use her knowledge of the city to address the problems she said have changed the Cambridge she once knew.
Akiba, who grew up in Nigeria, traveled to Cambridge throughout her childhood to visit her grandparents. Akiba’s extended family has lived in Cambridge for roughly 50 years. Now, as a resident of Cambridge and as the mother of two young boys, Akiba said she feels a responsibility to help her community.
“The things that once made our city special are now gone,” Akiba said. “It is less diverse. We see developments coming up left and right, and yet there is no affordable housing.”
Throughout her campaign, Akiba has spent time knocking on doors, calling local residents, and meeting people on the street. While she does not have prior political experience, she said that she intends to use her background in global health policy to step into the political arena and create a grassroots movement.
Since regulating real estate developers is a central issue of her campaign, Akiba said she refuses to accept donations from developers. She said she also takes issue with developers building infrastructure in an unsustainable way, even though Cambridge has the technology and budget for environmentally friendly projects. Akiba said she plans to mandate that developers construct green buildings.
“Our buildings are not being built sustainably. Eighty-five percent of our emissions come from buildings running on gas and electricity,” Akiba said.
In addition to her focus on environmental issues, Akiba sahe she also wants to prioritize education. Cambridge does not have universal preschool, something that Akiba hopes to change if elected.
“You would think that Cambridge being the home of Harvard and MIT, we would take education more seriously,” Akiba said. “We have the budget for universal [pre-kindergarten] but people are not prioritizing it.”
While Akiba’s primary platforms center on these issues, she also spoke of other initiatives. Akiba said she wants to improve mental health programs, provide housing for the city’s population of people experiencing homelessness, and allocate more resources toward low income neighborhoods. Akiba also said that those elected this year will likely pick the next City Manager, whom she hopes will be a person of color or a woman.
“Politicians say the same things,” Akiba said. “I may not be as rehearsed or as polished as them, [but] my feelings are genuine. We talk a good talk in Cambridge. It’s time for someone to do something.”

Incumbent City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan has spent his past two years on the council working to put climate change issues at the fore. In the lead-up to the Nov. 5 municipal election, he has continued to place the focus on his climate activist background and agenda.
“I’ve been a climate activist since I was 18 years old, and I’ve been working in the Cambridge community on that issue for the last decade or so,” Zondervan said. “I've been able to focus on that in my first time on the council and I will continue to work on that.”
Zondervan was born in Suriname and developed an early appreciation for the environment growing up near the Amazon Rainforest. He immigrated to Florida as a teenager to pursue an undergraduate degree, and in 1992, he came to Cambridge to get a master’s at MIT. It was during that time he met his wife, Harvard Computer Science professor Radhika Nagpa. Together, with their two children and their dog Lily, they’ve lived in the city ever since.
After his master’s, Zondervan worked as a software engineer and entrepreneur before serving as president and board chair of Green Cambridge, a nonprofit organization addressing climate change and sustainability in Cambridge. He has also been a member of the Climate Protection Action Committee for eight years and in recent years have overseen its climate vulnerability assessment as the committee’s chair. In 2013, he filed a net zero zoning petition with Massachusetts State Representative Mike Connolly, and its provisions were ultimately implemented across Cambridge.
He said the reason he initially ran for city council in 2017 is the same reason he’s running for re-election: to bring issues of climate change to the front of councilors’ conversations.
“Through my community advocacy, I reached a point where I felt I would be more effective being on the council than being on the outside asking the council to do things,” said Zondervan. “I have been able to achieve some of those things in my first term, but we still have a lot of work to do so I hope to be reelected and continue to work.”
In addition to climate reform, Zondervan said he also works to support vulnerable individuals in Cambridge, which has taken the form of backing a cycling safety ordinance, affordable housing initiatives, and efforts to make public transportation free. He has also led the city’s efforts to limit cannabis dispensary licenses in the city to “economic empowerment” or “social equity” applicants.
“I emphasize justice in protecting the most vulnerable in our community in all my work,” said Zondervan. “I don't think anyone else does that quite as intentionally as I do.”
If re-elected, Zondervan acknowledged that it will be important for the council to press local universities like Harvard to contribute to their policy efforts.
“[Harvard] provides a lot of opportunities to people, but for the most part, those are people who are already doing well,” Zondervan said. “We have a lot of people in our community who don’t have access to those opportunities. I’d like to see Harvard and MIT do more to create access for those folks as well.”
He said the primary way these schools can contribute to Cambridge residents outside their walls is to increase their contributions to the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program. Councilors and residents have long called on Harvard to offer more financial support to the cities where they own property.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not comment on statements from individual candidates, but referred The Crimson to previous statements.
“Harvard has a long tradition of paying taxes and making voluntary PILOT payments to its host communities,” O’Rourke has written previously. “During the last fiscal year, Harvard paid more than $4 million in a voluntary PILOT payment, as well as more than $6 million in taxes to the City of Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council candidate Adriane B. Musgrave wants Cambridge to address affordable housing, economic opportunity for everyone, and high-quality city infrastructure and city services.
Musgrave — who has lived in Cambridge for 10 years — said she will bring experience in nonprofit, corporate, and public sectors to the position. Some of her past experiences include working as a management consultant focused on innovation and serving as the executive director of Cambridge Local First, an organization that helps promote local businesses.
This is Musgrave’s second time running. Musgrave’s priorities now are “largely the same” as they were in her earlier 2017 campaign, she said.
“When you’re not housing stable, there are a slew of challenges that follow from that. Housing is the anchor for creating families’ financial stability,” she said.
One of these challenges is the racial opportunity gap, which Musgrave called “deeply entwined” with the affordable housing issue.
“The diversity here in Cambridge comes from our affordable housing and it creates opportunities for these families who have been denied opportunities for generations,” she said.
Musgrave said she proposes to address the issue of affordable housing through zoning reform.
“Reforming our zoning, which in many ways is restrictive and exclusionary based on race and class, is the way that we need to go,” she said.
Musgrave added that smart zoning does not require any public funding. She also said that she wants to ensure that the Cambridge city budget sets aside $20 million each year for the next five years specifically for affordable housing.
Another one of Musgrave’s proposals is using universal daycare to help expand economic opportunities for families. According to Musgrave, universal daycare is “absolutely immense.”
“It’s not just about daycare, the kind of programming that we would want, and the kind of infrastructure, from a social services standpoint that we would want to build, it’s really about helping families right from the start,” she said.
Two of Musgrave’s other priorities are transportation and climate change.
Musgrave has advocated for a protected bike lane along the entire length of Massachusetts Avenue, as well as improved access to public transportation. She was recently named a “Bike Champion” by Cambridge Bike Safety, an organization that aims to make Cambridge more bike friendly.
“The goal of our city planning, and how we want to be as a city going forward, is to allow everyone from eight to 80 to feel comfortable walking, biking, scootering throughout our community,” she said.
Musgrave also called emissions from Cambridge buildings “the biggest nut that we need to crack.” She said she wants to move Cambridge from the Stretch Code, an energy efficiency standard for buildings, to the Passive House Standard, which uses around 20 percent of the energy a standard building requires, according to Musgrave.
“This is the most energy efficient way to build a building and its been proven in other countries for a long time, even though it may seem very new and novel to us in the U.S.,” she said.
In particular, Musgrave said she hopes students will vote in the upcoming election.
“Voting in this election doesn’t just help you, doesn’t just help our community, it helps to pay it forward for the next student,” she said.

Incumbent Cambridge city councilor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. is seeking another term on a platform advocating for increased affordable housing and socioeconomic and racial diversity.
Toomey — a former State Representative and member of the Cambridge School Committee — first began serving on the City Council in 1989. He said his extensive background in city government and roots in East Cambridge inform his approach to serving on the Council.
“I think I have a pretty good background of the workings of the city government and what the residents, you know, need and expect from their elected officials,” he said.
This election cycle, Toomey said he will continue to prioritize his connections with constituents, referencing his office on 550 Cambridge St. and his longtime residence in the city.
“Obviously being someone who’s grown up in the city, I’ve been aware of the dynamics of the city. I’ve seen how the city has changed from a real working class, multi-ethnic city, to a very expensive city to call home now, so there’s no question about that,” Toomey said.
Though the city has met some of its inclusionary housing goals, Toomey said he would like to expand the policy to include family-style units for the middle class. Toomey is one of nine candidates endorsed by A Better Cambridge Action Fund, an organization committed to electing progressive pro-housing candidates.
“Everybody says that we need more affordable housing, but then there’s a caveat: ‘not in my neighborhood though,’” Toomey said. “What I and others have been trying to achieve is that all neighborhoods should have some affordable housing.”
“There are some opportunities, I think, in the other neighborhoods to expand on the affordable housing stock in the city,” he added.
Toomey is one of several Cambridge politicians working to build the Grand Junction Multi-use Path, a proposed multi-use trail for bikers and joggers that will run from the Boston University Bridge to Somerville. He said he is excited about the progress on the path thus far.
“Right now it’s very difficult to get from East Cambridge to the Cambridgeport to the Charles River. This way it’d be a straight route down the path,” Toomey said. “I think it’s something to knit the neighborhood together.”
Toomey added that private sector institutions like MIT — which has committed $8.5 million to construct a portion of the path — have supported the path alongside the city.
“We are working very hard to make that a reality,” Toomey said.
Toomey also cited his efforts to support local businesses, noting that he shares office space with the president of the East Cambridge Business Association. He cited initiatives including the Small Business Recycling Pilot, a program which provides small businesses with free recycling collection, and the Storefront Improvement Program, a city grant that finances storefront renovations.
Asked about Harvard’s relationship with Cambridge, Toomey said he thinks it could improve.
“Clearly, we always feel that the University can do more,” he said.
Toomey also spoke about his history with Harvard. He said that, as a child, he received tutoring at a Phillips Brooks House Association program.
“It really opened my eyes and it exposed me to a whole ’nother world that I hadn't experienced in my neighborhood,” Toomey said. “In public schools, the achievement gap is really glaring, and so the more that the universities can provide, especially educational resources to our students, is really very, very important.

Craig A. Kelley has made transportation innovation, affordable housing, climate change, and education his top priority issues for his Cambridge City Council re-election campaign.
Kelley is currently serving his seventh term as a city councilor and is the chair of the Council’s Public Safety Committee and co-chair of the Council’s Ordinance Committee.
During his past term on the city council, he wrote and led the passage of new housing legislation that makes it easier for people to create auxiliary dwelling units in their homes. Kelley said that this provision will open up more moderately sized and priced housing options in Cambridge.
“Right now, we are sort of flooded with relatively expensive, relatively luxury places. And this would be a counter to that,” Kelley said.
Last year, Kelley also championed the passage of zoning legislation that legalizes and regulates short-term rentals like Airbnb.
Outside of his work on affordable housing, Kelley has pushed micromobility – modes of transportation provided by light vehicles like electric scooters – to the forefront of his campaign. Kelley and his wife have been car-free for more than a decade, and he believes that micromobility devices help to eliminate congestion and promote pedestrian and cyclist safety.
“We have to move away from this backwards looking and thinking about transportation that everyone is going to own a car, get in their car by themselves, and drive by themselves to wherever they're going. That's going to choke us,” Kelley said. “The city that figures this out is going to have a big jump on the rest of the world in how it arranges its public spaces.”
Kelley also said that – amidst the rise of a new digital age – he believes that technology can be utilized to improve interactions between the people of Cambridge and the city government. He said he hopes to update the way in which the government manages its communications and workflow, in order to more efficiently tackle major issues.
“The city that runs well and uses these new digital tools, I think, is a city that will also be better able to address these other challenges like climate change, housing affordability, transportation equity, [and] educational equity,” he said.
Another core element of Kelley’s platform involves planning for and preventing climate change. He said he hopes to accomplish this by investing in resiliency-based infrastructure projects, changing zoning practices for battery storage and building drainage, and promoting educational outreach, according to his campaign website.
When asked about the challenges that the city council faces, Kelley pointed out that much of it is institutional. He said that holding elections every two years inhibits collaboration and progress.
“It makes it very difficult for us to honestly, openly, transparently, talk about meaningful, challenging issues because we know that whatever happens, we're going to be competing against each other in a relatively short period of time,” he said.
Looking forward, Kelley said he recognizes that Cambridge has the potential to influence how cities around the world address the most pressing issues.
“If we can help figure out models of meeting the challenges from affordable housing, to effective transportation, to climate change resiliency, we can help other people get to that same place,” he said.

Harvard astrophysicist and engineer Derek A. Kopon is combining his science career with politics by running in the Cambridge City Council elections.
Kopon — who works for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics — is running on a platform of campaign finance reform and environmental policy. A first-time candidate, Kopon said he became interested in this election cycle because he wanted to enact change from within the City Council.
“I entered politics because I watched what was going on in City Hall, and I was so disappointed with what was going on in City Hall. It didn’t seem to me like a process that would lead to good solutions,” Kopon said. “It seemed to me that our local politics should be functioning very differently than it is right now.”
Kopon said he has worked to be a transparent candidate in the race by directly emailing his supporters with any important information from City Council meetings. He also said he has worked with Cambridge residents in the past to research the source of donations in City Council elections. He said he is concerned about outside money from out-of-state corporate developers.
“I have been working with other concerned residents of Cambridge to do some research — to investigate where some of the money is coming from, why it is being given, what is behind some of the interests,” Kopon said.
Another aspect of Kopon’s campaign is sustainability and the environment, centered around environmental policy and tree protection.
Kopon said he believes that all new developments should have mandatory solar panels, noting that clean energy like solar panels can be both environmentally friendly and profitable.
“We are not putting anyone at a financial disadvantage by mandating that they put solar on developments,” Kopon said. “We’re simply saying that when you build new developments, that comes with an environmental cost.”
“As long as you’re building in the city, you should put solar panels on the roof, and its profitable for you to do that, so you should do that.” he added.
Kopon graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in engineering physics. During his career, he worked for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Kopon first moved to Cambridge in the summer of 2002 to pursue an internship with MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center. After leaving the city in 2007 to pursue his doctorate, he returned in 2015 to raise his family.
Another issue Kopon has weighed in on is recreational marijuana use in Cambridge, which he said he would treat as a “public health issue.” He said he believes that proper education and precautions must be put into place.
“I’d like the city to treat it as a public health issue, and if that means that there needs to be fewer cannabis stores right near schools or residential neighborhoods, then I think that should be the priority,” Kopon said.
Last month, the City Council passed legislation that opened the door for recreational marijuana businesses to open in Cambridge. Massachusetts legalized the use of marijuana in 2016.
Kopon said his main campaign goal is to ensure city leaders are representing the interests of Cambridge residents and are not motivated by profit.
“I would say that my biggest goal in this campaign is to try and get our civic leaders to make sure they’re representing the residents of the city,” Kopon said. “I think when there is so much outside money coming in that’s motivated by profit, I think that distorts the democracy, and that is what I’m trying to work against.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — In the wildest football game of the season, a desperation Hail Mary was tipped into the hands of a Dartmouth receiver to beat the buzzer and provide the undefeated Big Green with a stunning victory as the clock expired.
“It was obviously really high and I lost it in the sun for a second but it came back in, and I saw one guy tip it and it just fell right in front of me,” said Dartmouth junior wide receiver Masaki Aerts. “I just grabbed it and held onto it.”
With only six seconds left on the clock and no timeouts remaining, Dartmouth lined up at Harvard 43-yard line for what was likely to be the last play of the game. Junior backup quarterback Derek Kyler, who had entered the game for the injured starter just before halftime, took the shotgun snap and immediately found himself surrounded by the Harvard pass rush.
“I don’t know how I got outta it,” Kyler said. “I saw the dude come free on the end, and I knew the one thing I couldn’t do was take a sack, so I was just trying to find a way and on a play like that you’re not going to be looking for an open receiver, you’re more so throwing it in the crowd, hoping it’ll find its way into someone’s lap like it did for Saki.”
Somehow, the mobile quarterback spun and scrambled to his left, finding space to launch a pass into the end zone. Aerts found the tipped ball and secured it for a walk-off touchdown, winning the game, 9-6, for the Big Green.
“It was a classic,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “To say that we got our guts ripped out might be the understatement of the century.”
Harvard (4-3, 2-2 Ivy) seemed to have the game in hand as the fourth quarter clock wound down. With under four minutes to play, the No. 14/15 Big Green (7-0, 4-0) found itself facing a tough fourth down and six, trailing by only three points. Kyler scrambled backwards and launched a ball down the field, where senior linebacker Joey Goodman darted towards the sideline and made a leaping interception. While an impressive pick, Goodman's catch set Harvard’s offense to start at its own 30-yard line, while simply batting the ball down would have started the drive at Dartmouth’s 44.
Following a three-and-out, Goodwin’s decision seemed to greatly alter the game’s outcome. Snagging the snap off of the ground, junior punter Sean McKeough booted the ball 53 yards, starting the Big Green on its own nine-yard line with only 1:31 left in the contest.
The previous events of the game suggested it would take a strong push from Dartmouth’s offense to take the lead. The Big Green would never get the chance, as pressure from senior defensive lineman Brogan McPartland and sophomore defensive lineman Truman Jones forced a fumble recovered by McPartland.
Harvard, however, failed to run out the clock. On what seemed to be another befuddling Crimson decision, junior running back Devin Darrington darted along the sideline and was forced out of bounds to stop the clock.
“Clock management, somehow in the heat of passion, in the heat of the game, can go out the window real fast,” Murphy said.
After an unsuccessful fourth down conversion, Dartmouth took over at its own four-yard line with exactly one minute left on the clock. A 96-yard drive and one Hail Mary later, the Big Green would escape with a victory, effectively eliminating Harvard from contention for the Ivy League title.
 Harvard seemed to hold momentum throughout most of the defensive second half. Senior quarterback Jake Smith quickly showed signs of turning around his second-quarter struggles, completing his first four passes for 33 yards on Harvard’s opening drive. The offense, paired with the favorable field position, setup McIntyre for another attempt, knocking down a field goal from 38 yards to give Harvard a 6-3 lead, a lead that the Crimson would not give up until after the clock hit zero.
The third quarter would remain otherwise scoreless, with each defense refusing to give an inch. Darrington, who averaged six yards per carry in the first half, was held to two carries for three yards in the third quarter. Following McIntyre’s second field goal, the two squads slugged it out, forcing five straight punts and allowing only 46 total yards between the two offenses.
“I’m so proud of our kids,” Murphy said. “Our defense couldn't have played any better. It just feels predictively so cruel not to get down on the winning side.”
Hoping to spark its offense, the Crimson started to shake up its game plan, handing the ball to freshman running back Aidan Borguet four times for 15 yards to slowly chug across midfield. The big spark came on a 14-yard completion across the middle of the field to junior tight end Adam West. Smith stood strong in the pocket and took a large shot for a roughing the passer penalty, moving Harvard into the red zone.
The stout Dartmouth defense held tough, however, forcing a short Crimson field goal attempt. A low snap skipped the turf and helped to force McIntyre to miss his second field goal, pulling the 25-yard chip shot wide to the right. Harvard’s all-time leader in field goals would finish the close defensive game two-for-four. The kicking game clearly made a difference in a barnburner matchup during which points were at a premium, as the Crimson failed to score a touchdown for the first time this season.
 While the game’s exciting ending stunned the large crowd filling Harvard Stadium, the defensive stalemate of the first 59 minutes kept everyone in attendance anxious for a game-changing play. The well-attended matchup coincided with Harvard’s first-year parents' weekend, with the attendance of 20,112 marking the largest Harvard crowd for a non-Yale opponent since 2008. At the very beginning of the game, the Crimson gave the home crowd more to cheer about.
On Harvard’s first drive, junior running back B.J. Watson made his return felt quickly, making up for lost time with three catches for 30 yards. After having missed the previous two games, the running back was lined up out wide and showed off his speed on screen passes to help put Harvard in position to cap off its 11-play drive with a 43-yard field goal from McIntyre.
Before the contest even began, the Crimson welcomed the return of another familiar face: captain defensive back Wes Ogsbury represented Harvard at the coin toss before taking the field for the defense. The senior had missed the previous two games due to injury as well, but his start mirrored Watson’s. The first play from Dartmouth setup a screen at Ogsbury, who broke through the block and made an open-field tackle at the line of scrimmage.
The defense especially excelled throughout the day up front, allowing only 52 rushing yards.
“I think we're really stout up front and that's the driver for everything we do,” Ogsbury said. “You know [the line] sets the tone for us and the linebackers, the secondary, we’ve been practicing keep our eyes in the right places, running to the ball, having great discipline, and you know, minimizing the big plays. I think we were able to do that, and up front we were able to stop the run for the most part.”
The Crimson’s second drive started with a bang, as Smith scrambled to the left and created time for senior wide receiver Cody Chrest to slip behind the defense for a 35-yard gain. In the previous week, Smith struggled, throwing three interceptions that helped seal the game for Princeton. This week, however, the quarterback rebounded early, completing seven of his first eight passes for 89 yards in the first quarter.
Despite a punt at the end of the drive, Harvard’s offense would quickly get another chance. On the Big Green’s second play of the drive, senior quarterback Jared Gerbino aired out a long ball for senior wide receiver Drew Estrada. The wideout seemed to have multiple steps on Crimson junior defensive back Max Jones, but Gerbino, who had completed his first five passes of the game, underthrew his intended target. Estrada seemed to meet the ball in the air, but Jones wrestled it away before the pair hit the ground to secure an impressive interception just before the end of the first quarter.
 Following a Harvard punt, Dartmouth’s next drive ended in similar fashion. Estrada led Crimson senior linebacker Cameron Kline by multiple yards streaking down the sideline, but yet another underthrown pass from Gerbino on a likely Big Green touchdown allowed a diving Kline to break up the pass and force a Dartmouth punt.
After a huge, 23-yard carry from Darrington, Harvard found itself in a position to change the defensive nature of the contest. Facing a fourth down and three yards to gain on the Big Green 22, Murphy opted to allow his team to remain on the field instead of taking the field goal attempt. The gamble paid off, as Darrington carved through the middle of Dartmouth’s defense for eight yards and a first down.
The field goal team would see the field later in the drive, as a scrambling Smith escaped pressure and rolled left but was unable to connect with a receiver on third down. McIntyre’s second attempt of the day, however, missed wide left from 34 yards.
Despite Harvard’s strong start, the defense carried an offense that began to slow closer to halftime. Smith stumbled following a strong first period, going tw0-for-seven with only 11 yards through the air in the second quarter. Darrington’s seven carries for 62 yards in the second quarter helped the Crimson to keep control of the possession battle before halftime.
Attempting to capitalize on the Crimson mistake, the Big Green quickly found itself in a similar offensive position, facing a fourth and inches near midfield. Dartmouth matched Harvard’s aggressiveness, keeping the punt team on the sideline and converting on a quick reverse to Estrada.
Later in the drive, the Big Green would also feel the taste of missed opportunity. Gerbino once again missed a wide-open receiver for a would-be touchdown, robbing Dartmouth of a sure lead. The veteran quarterback would not get a chance to makeup for his third missed touchdown throw of the game. On the next play, Gerbino scrambled left and pulled out an ankle tackle from Harvard, but he immediately slowed and trotted out of bounds, finding the trainer’s tent and exiting the game. The Big Green would settle for a field goal, tying the defensive game at 3-3 heading into halftime.
“I don't think we could have played any better defensively,” Murphy said. “Two great defensive teams, and at the end of the day, I think that’s what the strength of both teams are.”
 The last few seasons of Ivy League football have been fairly predictable. Princeton, undefeated since November of 2017, has dominated, with Dartmouth not far behind. Clearly understanding the conference’s new alignment, the Ancient Eight setup an exciting November matchup between the Big Green and the Tigers at Yankee Stadium. Last season, this matchup served as a de-facto Ivy League championship between two undefeated teams, and many expected this season to be the same. While it seemed these plans would be foiled by a stout Harvard defense, a last-second heave from Kyler fell into the hands of Aerts to preserve the matchup of undefeateds next week in the Big Apple.
“It breaks my heart that our players weren't able to enjoy victory, out of that,” Murphy said. “What I said to them, there's not much solace but in any endeavor in life, something you really pour your heart and soul into, if you've given it everything you possibly can, you have no regrets. The problem is you have plenty of pain. But you can have no regrets.”
