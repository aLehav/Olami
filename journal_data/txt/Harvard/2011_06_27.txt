After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Upper Crust Pizzeria in Salem will pay more than $80,000 in liquidated damages and back wages to 11 employees following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division.
Franchise owner Michael Buchhalter violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by withholding full overtime pay to employees and keeping faulty records of their work hours, according to investigators. He has signed an agreement to pay the $40,277 owed to his employees as well as an equal amount in liquidated damages.
Upper Crust stores have faced multiple allegations of unfairly treating workers in recent years, drawing a critical response from some Harvard labor and immigration student groups.
Following allegations of mistreatment from two Upper Crust employees last summer, two Harvard Law School groups, the Harvard Immigration Project and the Labor and Employment Action Project, organized a boycott in February of the chain. The boycott eventually gained the support of 60 Harvard groups.
“It’s mostly just to send a message that we don’t support companies that treat their workers this way and aren’t compliant with labor and employment laws,” said Claire S. Valentin last February. At the time, she was a third-year Law School Student and president of the Harvard Immigration Project.
In that case, the employees alleged that the store forced them to give back overtime wages and took advantage of multiple workers, many of whom were illegal immigrants from Brazil. They filed a lawsuit last summer, with depositions currently being taken.
Upper Crust has denied those allegations.
In 2009, a separate investigation by the Department of Labor required The Upper Crust LLC to pay $341,545.53 in back wages to 121 employees in 10 restaurants.
Buchhalter Ltd. operates the Salem franchise separately from the corporate-owned Upper Crusts in the Boston area, and Buchalter and the corporate side have both emphasized that distinction.
George Regan, an Upper Crust spokesman, told the Boston Globe that the Salem operator is “a franchisee and its own separate entity.’’
“We are pleased that the 11 employees will get the back pay and damages they deserve,” wrote Supawon Lervisit, a third-year Harvard Law School student and board member of the Harvard Immigration Project, in an emailed statement. “The violations committed at the one Salem franchise reflect a pattern of worker mistreatment endemic to … the restaurant industry in general.”
No lawsuit was filed because Buchhalter was immediately compliant with the investigators, said Edmund Fitzgerald, a spokesman with the Department of Labor.
Carlos Matos, assistant director of the Wage and Hour Division’s Boston District Office, said in a press release that holding FLSA violators accountable for liquid damages in addition to back wages “ensures accountability under the law and also helps level the playing field for those employers who play by the rules and pay their workers fair wages.”
David Berman, a lawyer for Upper Crust, could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 350 million adults worldwide have diabetes, according to a new study, more than double the number 30 years ago and the latest sign that the prevalence of the disease is increasing.
The study, led by Goodarz Danaei of the Harvard School of Public Health and Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, analyzed diabetes data from 1980 to 2008. Their analysis found that while in 1980, 153 million adults had diabetes, by 2008, that number had swelled to 347 million.
That increase led the researchers to conclude that systems need to be developed to detect, prevent, and manage diabetes.
“Unless we develop better programs for detecting people with elevated blood sugar and helping them to improve their diet and physical activity and control their weight, diabetes will inevitably continue to impose a major burden on health systems around the world,” Danaei said in a statement.
Increases in diabetes prevalence occurred both in men and women and in most areas of the world. 8.3 percent of men and 7.5 percent of women had diabetes in 1980, but by 2008, worldwide prevalence increased to 9.8 percent of men and 9.2 percent of women.
In the United States, diabetes prevalence jumped from 6.1 percent to 12.6 percent among men and 5.1 percent to 9.1 percent among women, according to the study.
While east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe saw almost no change in prevalence, rates increased in almost every other area of the world. They rose most dramatically in Oceania, where 15.5 percent of men and 15.9 percent of women are now diabetic. The region has the highest prevalence in the world.
Besides Oceania, the highest rates occurred in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. High-income countries with the highest rates included the United States, Greenland, Malta, Spain, and New Zealand, while the lowest rates were in the Netherlands, Austria, and France.
Diabetes cases in China and India alone account for 40 percent of all cases worldwide.
Researchers attributed 70 percent of the total increase to changes in population size and life expectancy, meaning 30 percent was the product of other factors.
"The obesity problem in the developing world is increasing," said Yuan Lu, a doctoral candidate in the School of Public Health and one of the researchers. “That might be one of the reasons [for increased prevalence]. Dietary factors, blood pressure, and important risk factors also have an increasing trend in the developing world."
The lowest blood glucose levels, the best indicator of diabetes, were found in Sub-Saharan Africa and east and southeast Asia.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization funded the study, which was published on Saturday in the Lancet.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
CLARIFICATION: June 28, 2011
Due to an editing error, the headline of an earlier version of this article ("Diabetes Rate Almost Doubles Worldwide Since 1980") was misleading. The diabetes rate in the United States approximately doubled, while the number of people with diabetes in the world more than doubled, according to the study.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months before they’ll put on a Harvard uniform for the first time, four incoming Crimson freshmen were chosen in Saturday’s National Hockey League draft.
With these four additions, there will be eight NHL draftees on Harvard’s roster going into the 2011-12 season.
The structure of the NHL draft differs from that of the other three major American sports. Unlike in MLB, the NBA, and the NFL, players selected by NHL teams can continue to compete on the amateur level while remaining the protected picks of the team that originally selected them.
Baseball, football, and basketball prospects are forced to choose between signing a professional contract or retaining amateur status and NCAA eligibility shortly after the draft.
Two future Harvard icemen, goaltender Stephen Michalek and forward Petr Placek, were taken in the sixth round. Forward Colin Blackwell and defensemen Max Everson—brother of junior forward Marshall Everson—were both taken in the seventh round.
In total, five rising Harvard freshmen have been drafted. Patrick McNally was selected in the 2010 draft and will suit up for the Crimson for the first time this fall.
Junior forward Alex Fallstrom and senior forward Alex Killorn were selected by NHL teams before their freshman seasons, and junior defensemen Danny Biega was taken before the start of his sophomore year.
While draftees have the option to play through college, not all do. Louis Leblanc, formerly class of 2013, left Harvard after his freshman year to sign with Montreal Canadiens.
But for now, the Crimson can look forward to the addition of five rookies with NHL-caliber talent.
