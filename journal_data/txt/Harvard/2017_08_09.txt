After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first began thinking of college, I didn’t know “Hartford” and “Harvard” were two different places. But I did know that getting into an “Ivory League” university would be harder because I was Asian.
Like many Chinese Americans, my parents are immigrants. They gave up friends, family, and high-status jobs for a minimum-wage shot in a country they didn’t know. Instead of being respected for their linguistic prowess (they each knew seven languages at their prime), their fluent American accents were met with mildly insulting surprise. Instead of climbing a steady corporate ladder, they continue to scrape by as small business owners. And instead of growing up in the expanses of Shanghai, I grew up in the flea markets and convention centers where they kept shop, contributing as both a “little saleslady” and a nuisance.
These are the hardships my parents chose willingly and the ones that I was born into. But they can all be overlooked because this is also the land of endless opportunity that my parents wanted to give me an equal chance to live in. Naturally, I want success for myself—and I will work hard until I reach it—but I also want to succeed for my parents’ sake and to prove with my happiness that, despite all its flaws, this is still a country where it is possible to fly high on passion.
And it is precisely because my parents have sacrificed so much for my education that I, an Asian American, find affirmative action necessary for a fair definition of merit.
When we talk about college admissions, we talk about merit. But what do we mean by this word? Many arguments against affirmative action will cite a 2009 Princeton study, which found that in order to have the same chance for admission at selective universities, Asian Americans had to score 140 points higher on the SATs than white students, 270 points more than Hispanics, and 450 points more than black applicants when controlling for athletics but not extracurriculars.
While this calculation of “merit” is provocative, it is important to remember that people are not numbers. We are our family, our communities—pictures bound by frames that make it necessary for us to take pride in the distance we have travelled rather than the absolute altitudes we have reached.
Instead of focusing on the 2350 I got on a test I spent way too much time studying for, let’s talk instead about how it was always expected that I’d go to college, how my parents constantly reassured me that they’d pay my way, how they didn’t hesitate when paying for a $5,000 summer program that was only two weeks. Let’s talk about how my house was always filled with books, both English and Chinese, how my parents know at least something about everything, and how they were willing to drive me half an hour to school at 6:30 in the morning.
Let’s talk about privilege.
The difference between a 2000 and a 2400 on the SAT is not a reflection of intelligence if the person who scored a 2000 had one try for the test and had to work part-time jobs to support basic expenses. A 4.3 GPA isn’t more impressive than a 4.1 if the person with a 4.1 goes to a school that offers only a quarter of the Advanced Placement classes that the other one does.
Affirmative action is important not because of race itself, but because of the enormous inequalities that are attached to bits of pigment and history. Our president is therefore right to question the equity of affirmative action not because of “discrimination against whites and Asians,” but only because of the vast inequalities and diversity contained within the label of “Asian” itself.
When I think “Asian,” I think East Asian and then Indian. A lot of this has to do with the fact that I am Chinese American, but even more has to do with the fact that these are essentially the only two areas of Asia that I see represented at Harvard. It takes another person to remind me that the Philippines and Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand are also a part of this label.
Unsurprisingly, this lengthy list of countries leads to a lengthy list of discrepancies. For example, Hmong Americans and Cambodian Americans make only half the median income of Indian Americans. And while 70 percent of Indian Americans hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, only 26 percent of Vietnamese Americans hold one. These numbers don’t even begin to touch on the inequality that exists within these ethnicities.
As Harvard moves forward, it should continue to let in the private-school geniuses who see Harvard as home, but it must also let let in those who see Harvard as an opportunity. If the president is serious about racial equality in the college admission process, he must realize that intelligence, hard work, and potential can’t be simplified into numbers, and that the categories we have are imperfect because of their expanse rather than their existence. If Harvard is serious about racial equality, it must stop its favoritism for legacy applicants and wealthy families—who come from all racial backgrounds—and realize that real inequality exists within affirmative action.
And as Asian Americans, we can’t afford to give in to sweeping generalizations that overlook the details of our diversity. We should take pride in the sacrifices we and our families have made and assert our right to success. But we must also remember that sacrifice itself is a strange form of privilege.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Aug. 9, 2017, at 1:01 p.m.
When my friend first mentioned to me that her cousin works at Google, I asked how “he”—yes, I said “he”—likes it there. I have been coding since I was 13 years old. I currently study Computer Science. I interviewed with Google just a couple of months ago. I, more than most, understand that a woman can choose to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math and thrive while working for prestigious Silicon Valley tech companies. However, much to my own shame, I immediately assumed my friend’s cousin was male.
Sadly, it’s often not a wrong assumption to make. It is statistically true that men dominate STEM and STEM-related fields. A 2013-14 study states that of all students who received a bachelor’s degree in engineering or computer and information sciences, only around 18% were women. However, this disproportionality exists in other fields, as women dominate music, anthropology, and—surprise!—women’s and gender studies.
A central problem regarding the treatment of women in STEM is that people view numerical equality as the solution. Many STEM classes, particularly Harvard’s beloved CS50, boast their relatively high—which sometimes means a mere 30 percent—percentage of female students. This, yes, is wonderful. I proudly attended an all girls' school for the majority of my life, and am thus a product of the benefits of learning alongside my female peers.
However, I do not believe that women are predominantly hindered by their being a numerical minority in STEM, but rather by the degrading ways in which they are regarded. It would be foolish of me to assume, even in a predominantly female STEM class, that I would be perceived as equally intelligent as my male classmates. And that, unfortunately, is the issue.
It is not about being outnumbered. People often find strength through seeing themselves as underdogs, and I personally find this minority status empowering, as it continuously urges me to prove people wrong by rising above the low standards they set. The issue instead stems from others' warped, inherent assumption that your aptitude for the subject lags at blocks behind the boys, and continues to linger there.The worst harm we can inflict on women in STEM, on the revolutionaries who choose to pursue a field knowing they will face prejudice and ridicule, is to fail to give their work the admiration it deserves.
If people believe a male science student to be unintelligent, perhaps it is due to his answering a question incorrectly or his inadequate social skills (like mine). Having that as the source of the assumption that you are unintelligent is, unfortunately, a privilege. The notion that I, on the other hand, am unintelligent is likely formed the instant I walk into a lecture hall. Or, hilariously, the second I walked up onto the Sanders Theatre stage as CS50's first volunteer of the year. And, although others may assume it, I do not believe I was chosen from the crowd "just because I am a woman." Please.
Our biggest concern should not be the the lack of numerical equality between men and women in science. We should be, though, immensely troubled when my female peers and I are perceived as unintelligent because of it. Women in STEM are so much more than that. We are pioneers in our fields, becoming role models for generations to come—for girls who were once just like us. We are brave for choosing to pursue careers in which we are conscious of the prejudice, perceived unintelligence, and hateful and degrading commentary we may encounter. It’s also important to acknowledging that, as a white woman, my experience in STEM differs from those of the women of color beside me. I hope we can begin to hear more of their stories, as intersectionality is important in such discussions.
We do not reside at blocks behind. We are here, sitting beside you in classrooms, completing the same problem sets and test evaluations. We are here, and we always have been. We are the minority, yet we will not allow preconceived notions of our lack of value to preclude us from a seat at the table.
We draw strength from each other, from the women who came before us and who are to follow: a force of unparalleled magnitude.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Historical Commission approved plans to create a pedestrian mall in the heart of Harvard Square, one of three proposed large-scale developments in the area, earlier this summer.
The project, named “The Collection at Harvard Square,” calls for the demolition of the Corcoran building—currently home to Urban Outfitters—and its replacement with a new building, as well as renovations and additions to the neighboring buildings at 1-7 JFK St. and 18-20 Brattle St. The combined buildings will be covered with a rooftop terrace, according to the current plans.
The next hurdle for the developers, Jacksonville-based Regency Centers, involves seeking approval from the Cambridge Planning Board.
If successful at the Planning Board, the project will return back to the Historical Commission for further review on construction materials and a variety of details on entrances and storefronts, according to Charles M. Sullivan, the commission’s executive director.
After months of meetings and debate at the Historical Commission—the plans were initially filed in August of 2016—the project underwent a series of revisions and was finally granted a ‘certificate of appropriateness,’ meaning it “is not incongruous to the historic aspects or architectural character of the building or district.”
“This project went through a series of reviews, probably about twenty-five hours of hearings, for a number of months,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan said developers made several throughout the process, including demolishing and reconstructing the Urban Outfitters building instead of the initial plan to add two stories. The rooftop space was also significantly cut back in size.
Despite these changes, some remain concerned about the project. City Councillor Jan Devereux said she still has reservations about the plans for a “luxury mall.”
“Based on the demographics of Harvard Square, which is extremely diverse and obviously caters not only to students who have student budgets but also to visitors from all over the world, I would hope that it would serve more than just the 1 percent,” Devereux said. “But the economics are such that, I don’t know if that will be possible,” she added.
Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor and founder of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, echoed Devereux’s concerns about the shift towards a more high-end Harvard Square and the consequent pricing out of existing businesses, such as the world’s only Curious George store.
“Local business owners I speak with are deeply upset since few will be able to do afford to do business here soon, other than banks, fast food restaurants, and pricey national chains,” Blier wrote in an email.
To enable more local businesses to set up shop in the square, Devereux said she is looking into “various strategies in the zoning that could help us push back a little bit against the incursion of formula businesses.”
She noted that, from an urban planning perspective, having numerous small storefronts—unlike the large Urban Outfitters store that has two storefronts, or the many banks currently in the Square—would better contribute to the vibrancy of the streets.
Blier said she worries that, beyond affecting the commercial landscape of the square, the proposed penthouse and rooftop “will reify already escalating social divisions locally.”
“The very wealthy who can afford to dine atop the proposed luxury restaurant roof terrace, will be able to look down on the poorer city residents and visitors waiting to eat or take-out fast food pizzas across the street at 18 Brattle—and vice versa!”
The proposed plans will be up for further discussion at the Planning Board soon. Meanwhile, Regency Centers is still fine tuning plans for the property.
“We are looking forward to presenting our vision to the surrounding community and interested parties in the near future,” Eric Davidson, communications manager for Regency, wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it solicits advice from students, professors, and alumni about who should be Harvard’s next president, the committee tasked with replacing University President Drew G. Faust may also turn to a familiar set of outsiders: executive search firms.
But they may not say so.
Universities will often enlist the help of outside search firms to publicize administrative searches or scrutinize potential candidates. And while Harvard has frequently turned to the firms for positions across the University, it has historically run its presidential searches in-house, relying on an selection committee comprised of members of its two governing boards: the Corporation and the alumni-staffed Board of Overseers.
But even if Harvard decides to officially forgo a search firm this time, Jan Greenwood—president of the higher education search firm Greenwood/Asher—said it may still consult with one informally.
“Even universities that don’t appear to be using search firms are using them in a behind-the-scenes kind of way,” Greenwood said.
William F. Lee, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and chair of the presidential selection committee, wrote in an email that there is “nothing new right now” on the committee’s decision on the matter.
If the University does retain a search firm formally or informally, John Assunto, managing partner of the search firm WorldBridge Partners, said it might look at a similar pool of candidates as some peer institutions, which rely on a cache of external search firms to manage their outreach. The searches can seem “incestous,” Assunto said, as Harvard reviews candidates often considered for top academic jobs.
“Academic institutions are very deep in what we refer to as leather bound thinking: ‘we’ve always been doing it this way, and because they’ve always been doing it that way, what ends up happening is they don’t want to change,’ Assunto said. “What happens is you get a lot of candidates, especially senior administration at academic institutions that are regurgitated, that just came from a similar spot.”
The search is still in its initial outreach stage. At this point, the search committee members have begun to solicit input from faculty, students, staff, and alumni across the University about the qualities and backgrounds that would make for an ideal candidate. Last month, Lee sent a message calling on Harvard affiliates to send their submissions to a designated email address.
Then, the committee will may create what Greenwood called a “position description,” which identifies core challenges and opportunities facing the institution and the skills needed to meet them. “That becomes almost like a contract for what the search committee is looking for,” Greenwood said. “So your key starting point is what the position description identifies.”
How long it takes to create this sketch can vary. Stanford University, which announced its newest president in February 2016, came up with a list of “presidential attributes” after gathering feedback through an online survey and a town hall meeting last fall. At the University of Virginia—which is in the final stages of selecting its next president—the search committee held over 50 feedback sessions during its outreach phase, according to The Daily Progress, over the course of four months before coming up with a final “position profile” in May.
Even without the help of an outside firm, this year’s committee will be larger than ever before, featuring the full Corporation—which announced that it would expand its membership in 2010—and three members of the Overseers for a total of 15 members. Search firm expert Melissa K. Trotta said the size of the body isn’t “overly large” for a presidential search, and may improve the reach of the search.
“One of the values of a group of this size is that various lines of thinking will likely be represented, and if the committee functions well, there will be some healthy debate as candidates are identified,” Trotta, associate managing principal of Washington D.C.-based AGB Search wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team released its 2017-2018 regular season schedule on Tuesday afternoon. The Crimson will be looking to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015.
The nonconference portion of the slate is highlighted by a Dec. 2 trip to Lexington, Ky., to take on John Calipari’s Kentucky Wildcats. Harvard and Kentucky have never met. Calipari led the Wildcats to the Elite Eight last season and is projected to have another Top 10 team this season. Ivy League plays kicks off five weeks later when the Crimson plays host to Dartmouth at newly renovated Lavietes Pavilion. The second annual Ivy League tournament will be played at the Palestra in Philadelphia on March 10 and 11.
The unofficial start of the season will take place in just over two months, when Harvard hosts its annual Crimson Madness on Oct. 13. The team’s opening weekend of the regular season will feature home dates with rivals MIT (Nov. 10) and UMass (Nov. 12).
Following its conference opener on Jan. 6, Harvard will play its next five Ivy contests away from home. Makai Mason—who missed all of last season with a foot injury—will lead Yale into its Jan. 26 matchup with the Crimson in New Haven. Harvard will ship out to New York the following weekend to take on Columbia and Cornell.
Harvard’s rivalry with Princeton will be renewed when Mitch Henderson’s team visits Cambridge on Feb. 9. The Tigers topped the Crimson by a combined five points in last season’s two matchups and were the Ivy League’s representative in the NCAA Tournament. Home dates with Penn, Brown, and Yale round out a stretch in which Harvard takes on its three counterparts from last season’s Ivy League tournament in nine days. A trip down I-95 to take on the Quakers and Tigers precedes a Senior Day weekend that will see fourth-years Andre Chatfield, Chris Egi, and Zach Yoshor host Cornell and Columbia for the last time.
In addition to its showdown with Kentucky, the Crimson has several other high-profile nonconference matchups for 2017-2018. The team will travel to Fullerton, Calif., over Thanksgiving break to participate in the Wooden Legacy. Harvard’s first round draw in the eight-team tournament is St. Mary’s. Randy Bennett’s team went 29-5 last year and has won 20 or more games in each of the past 10 seasons. Following its game on Thanksgiving, the Crimson will take on either St. Joseph’s or Washington State on Saturday and could potentially play Georgia or San Diego State the following day. Harvard is guaranteed three games in the Golden State.
A particularly interesting matchup comes for Tommy Amaker’s team over winter break. The Crimson will travel to Williams Arena to take on Minnesota on Dec. 29. The Golden Gophers were a five-seed in last season’s NCAA Tournament and return several key pieces from a team that won 24 games a year ago. Amaker is no stranger to the Land of 10,000 Lakes, having recruited Siyani Chambers ’16-17 beginning when the former star point guard was an eighth grader. It will mark the first time that Harvard has squared off with a Big Ten opponent since the Crimson took on Michigan in December of 2010. All told, Harvard will take on five teams that participated in last season’s NCAA Tournament.
Harvard went 2-4 last season against the five nonconference teams that appear on its schedule again this year. One of the Crimson’s wins during that stretch came against Northeastern, which will host Amaker’s bunch on Nov. 30. Fellow Boston rival BU will make the trip to Lavietes on Dec. 21 while reigning America East champion Vermont comes to visit on Jan. 2.
Fans who are hoping to see Harvard play on the road would be wise to sign up for Amtrak’s rewards program. The Crimson will make trips to Worcester (Holy Cross, Nov. 16), New York (Manhattan, Nov. 18 and Fordham, Dec. 6), and Washington, D.C. (George Washington, Dec. 23) in the coming months. Harvard wraps up its nonconference slate with a trip to Spartanburg, S.C., to take on Wofford on Jan. 10.
Amaker’s 11th season at the helm in Cambridge will feature the Super Seven’s second act. The Crimson’s seven members of the class of 2020 all figure to see playing time in a rotation that returns Egi as well as juniors Corey Johnson, Weisner Perez, and Tommy McCarthy. The team also welcomes three freshmen in Danilo Djuricic, Reed Farley, and Mario Haskett. Harvard returns 73 percent of its minutes and 75 percent of its scoring from a team that went 18-10 overall and fell in a semifinal of the Ivy League tournament.

Bostonians do not, as a rule, walk the Freedom Trail. It’s the same as New Yorkers who don’t ascend the Empire State Building or Los Angelenos who don’t hang out in front of the Hollywood sign. We’ll do it—maybe—if friends are in town and have nothing to do.
To break the pattern, Flyby decided to embark on the 2.5-mile historic tour of Boston to experience our (well, neighboring) city from the point of view of an outsider—so you don’t have to.
The Freedom Trail is a path that snakes through downtown Boston from the Common to Bunker Hill, passing 16 historic locations. Of course, you can sign up for an official tour led by a guide in traditional colonial wear and inevitably a thick Boston accent, but it’s pretty easy to walk the trail by yourself too. The visitor’s booth on Boston Common sells maps for $3, and that provided me with enough guidance for the trek. Plus there was always Google to help me out.
I don’t want to spoil the ending of the American Revolution, so I won’t go into too many specifics, but here’s a brief rundown of the best historic locations and what to avoid.
The first stop on the tour after Boston Common is the Massachusetts State House. While I appreciate a nice gilded roof, it does make you question where all our tax dollars are going.
After Park Street Church comes the Granary Burying Ground, which is a tourist hotspot even for those who aren’t walking the whole trail. Bostonian legends like Paul Revere, John Hancock, and, inevitably, Tom Brady are/will be buried here.
From there you go to King’s Chapel, the first Unitarian Church in America. The chapel, unlike many of the landmarks on the tour, mentioned its “complicated” relationship with slavery. While the family of Charles Sumner—the senator who was brutally beaten for his anti-slavery stances and a member of the Class of 1830—sat in the 74th pew, the chapel never took a firm stance on slavery.
Though the Freedom Trail mostly focuses on well-known revolutionaries and glosses over other Americans, there is a Black Heritage Trail that offers free guided tours and tells the story of early America from a different and necessary perspective.
The next few stops were old meeting and state houses. One dad, after noticing that a meeting house had an entrance fee, turned and said to his children, “We got it: It’s a room.” Flyby approves of his attitude.
We then stopped at the historic Sephora on North St. to thank the Founding Fathers for the blessings they have provided to their posterity.
If you really wanted to dive into the colonial experience, there are plenty of old taverns and pubs around where you can sing the national anthem until you’re red in the face. Instead, I, like any good millennial, went to the restaurant Saus, best known for its french fries and sauces.
It was about here, more or less halfway through, that we discovered a literal brick trail that leads you through the monuments. It’s like Google Maps but, you know, tangible, visible, and physically in the ground.
The next few stops were houses and graveyards, again. I passed the U.S.S. Constitution without really noticing the giant ship because we were too preoccupied with our fear of bridges, but you could spend at least a few hours just visiting the museum there.
The last—and my favorite—stop was Bunker Hill. While misinformed pseudo-Bostonians like pre-Freedom Trail me might mistake it for a replica Washington Monument, the 221-foot Bunker Hill monument contains quite a bit of history.
The Battle of Bunker Hill was one of the bloodiest fights of the American Revolution, leaving over 200 dead and more than 800 wounded. The monument, which you can walk up, stands to honor those fallen in the first major battle of the Revolutionary War.
Be warned: Climbing up that monument is hard. It’s 20 flights of stairs, which is a lot of stairs. It is also a bunch of sweaty people, no windows, and very little light. If you’re really craving a view of Charlestown, then climb away. But I left as a hot sweaty mess who Ubered home.
All Bostonians (and those who live nearby) are lucky to live in a place where you can shop, view history, and explore most of the city in just about two and a half hours. I think I saw more of Boston on the Freedom Trail than in an entire childhood spent in Cambridge. Even if you don’t like history, it’s worth following the brick trail for a nice view of the “Walking City.”
I will say there was something moving about the Freedom Trail. At a time when Americans can’t agree on even basic facts, the Trail takes you back to a period when (almost) all Americans were united in fighting a common enemy—and, spoiler alert, we won.
We’ve grown by 37 states and righted many wrongs since 1775, yet the ideals that animated the men who died at Bunker Hill seem to have either been forgotten or disregarded. George Washington, John Hancock, and the other wig-wearing men of the 18th century were far from perfect, but they fought for a common good on which this country is built. That’s something—even if you’re a lethargic Harvard student—that’s worth walking for.

If you’re living under a rock this summer, we suggest you find something a little bit more durable. You may need it, and this playlist, in the days to come.  
President Donald Trump escalated a conflict with North Korea Tuesday by telling the country its provocations would be “met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.” The sort of clap-back you wish you could tell the professor who assigns a midterm on Housing Day.
They were unscripted comments, prompted by threats from the country earlier in the day from North Korea that it “ruthlessly take strategic measures involving physical actions” in the wake of U.N. Security Council sanctions.
We know, intense, right? So things aren’t exactly looking up for the world right now. We’re not one to assign homework, but we’re also not one to explain the intricacies of nuclear conflict, so read this cover piece from The Atlantic to get up to speed:
In the meantime, do what any average American does in times of crisis: listen to some kickass music to match the drama of the day. We present Flyby’s “The End is Nigh” playlist, because if we’re going out, we might as well go out with some sweet background music.
If you like it,follow our Spotify account, where you’ll find a few playlists of ours from last semester, and where you can expect more to come.
If you don’t like it, tell us about it. Shoot a message to flyby@thecrimson.com, especially if you have ideas for more songs we can include.
