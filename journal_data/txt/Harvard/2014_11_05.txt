Fred Taylor is a living jazz encyclopedia. A jazz impresario for over half a century, he knows the temper of hundreds of musicians, and remembers every jazz venue in Boston as far back as the 1950s. As his jazz club Scullers celebrates its 25th anniversary, Taylor sat down with The Crimson to talk about his stories, visions, and lifetime love for jazz.
The Harvard Crimson: Starting from the 1960s, you have been running several jazz clubs, including...Scullers. How was the jazz scene in Boston when you first started, and what got you into the music business?
Fred Taylor: In the late ’40s and throughout the ’50s, there was a terrific jazz scene at the crossing between Mass Ave. and Columbus Ave. You could always find national acts at clubs like Hi-Hat and Pioneer. [At that time,] I bought a Revere tape recorder with a five-inch reel, and recorded performances…. I by chance recorded a fantastic session of Dave Brubeck. It was so great that his record company wanted to put this out [and made it] one of the first 10-inch LPs, titled “Jazz at Storyville.” It received great critical acclaim, and since then, Dave and other musicians invited me to record more songs, still with my amateur machine. [Later on,] I started a booking company, and when the Jazz Workshop opened in 1961, I got the chance to book it. The first artist to perform [there] was Stan Getz, and then followed John Coltrane. Since then, I have been an impresario.
THC: Throughout these years, you have cooperated with numerous musicians. [Do you have] any anecdotes about them?
FT: I had many interesting [experiences] with Miles Davis. I first met him in 1967; he was already famous and was known for his eccentricity. I asked him how he liked to run his sets, and he said, “I came here to play, man.” I told him we opened at nine and closed at two and he was in charge, and then [I] went away. So he played for the whole night and then asked me how I thought of the band. I told him that they could be better, and he said, “You know, you are right.” That little interaction set our relationship. Miles was a very direct guy; he didn’t like any flattery or puffery. Since then, I became the only guy he would play for in Boston. Another story: at some point of his life, Miles went through an accident and had a hip replaced. In 1987, I also had a surgery and got both hips replaced. So when Miles came to Boston, I told him I was finally “hipper” than him. He threw his arms around me and said, “You old motherfucker!”
THC: How has jazz changed [since] the ’70s?
FT: Jazz, in its very nature, is a developmental type of music. Berklee, for example, is pouring out hundreds of music students every year, so there’s an infusion of music over the world. Last week, there was a Turkish performer at Scullers called Mehmet Sanlikol. He’s experimenting with an infusion of Turkish music [into] jazz structure. Even among American musicians, there’s an experimentation with fusion of rock and rap; there’s some great jazz rap now. Jazz keeps evolving. It keeps its roots in New Orleans but is always absorbing new things.
THC: One of the current directions of jazz is “pop jazz,” represented by Michael Bublé and Norah Jones. Do you think this is the future of jazz?
FT: I think it’s another step of the evolution of jazz. When I heard the demo of Norah Jones’s first album, I thought she was really doing something special, so I brought her in before the album was released. Five or six years later, her agency put her into 5,000-seat auditoriums because there was a big demand. I told them not to push her too much because she had a very private, intimate personality. As it turned out, they made a lot of money quick and then she crashed. She’s been trying to find herself ever since.
THM: Many people would say the popularity of jazz has been declining in recent years. Do you think this has had a significant impact on jazz clubs?
FT: There’s some very funny things going on. On one hand, there are many more young jazz players than ever before, and yet there are fewer young jazz listeners. Also, jazz festivals draw a humongous crowd, but it doesn’t carry over to many local small groups. There’s a lot of jazz in the suburbs at small restaurants and hotels, but national jazz clubs are struggling. There’s a disconnect here, and I can’t quite figure it out. However, I don’t think jazz will ever die. It’s a living music, and it keeps evolving.

When Nicki Minaj first began releasing mixtapes and being featured on albums, many listeners and critics were full of excitement about such a creative and powerful rapper, particularly a female one. But thus far, Minaj’s official albums, though successful as measured by copies sold and charts topped, have been to others something of a disappointment. Minaj herself has talked, rapped, and sung about internal and external pressures to popify, but her efforts to appeal to both pop and rap audiences have left many unsatisfied.
Unlike “Pills n Potions” and “Anaconda,” the two previous singles from Minaj’s upcoming album, “The Pinkprint,” “Only” seems to be aimed at fans of Minaj’s rap rather than her pop. In fact, the only melody on the track is sung by Chris Brown in a short chorus. One verse is rapped by Minaj herself, and two others are taken by Drake and Lil Wayne, respectively. But resemblance to the Minaj critics were so excited about on her mixtape “Beam Me Up Scotty” and Kanye’s “Monster” doesn’t go much farther than the adherence of these works to the hip-hop genre.
The same four notes loop throughout the track, ringing out like bells on a steady beat. While the sequence sounds familiar from numerous club songs, the effect is atmospheric at first. There is an implicit I’ll-take-my-time-if-I-want-to attitude, but the simplicity and precision of the basic setup seem to call for some sort of vibrant aberration, and this moment never comes.
The lyrics are clever and capable enough, as you’d expect from three experienced rappers. But something is lost from Minaj’s and Lil Wayne’s verses due to the monotone in which they’re expressed. Minaj’s finesse as a rapper comes in part from the overflowing personality of her delivery—maniacal laughter and frenetic alternation between personas. But being aloof is far less original. While it might add variety to an album, as a single, “Only” lacks the personality and creativity of some of Minaj’s earlier work.
“The Pinkprint” is out Dec. 15 via Young Money Entertainment.

Chaz Bundick, better known in association with his main musical project Toro y Moi, has always been an experimental artist, combining R&B, disco, chillwave, electronic, house, soul, and indie rock influences. He has a few musical alter-egos, such as The Heist and The Accomplice, but Les Sins, his dance-themed, production-centric side project is the biggest contender to rival his more popular Toro y Moi. Les Sins’s debut album, “Michael,” is an energetic record that manages to be captivating while moving away from Toro y Moi’s lyrically driven style.
The beats are clearly the focus of this album, and they are done to perfection. They vary but are generally driven by synthesized instrumentals. Les Sins is a producer, not exactly a vocalist or a musician exactly, while as Toro y Moi, he filled all of these roles. The instrumentals on “Michael” are coherent but not overly repetitive. On “Bellow,” chiming and synth-y harmonies are woven into a common musical theme that is interpreted in different ways throughout the song. Bundick also pulls from a multitude of inspirations for these tracks. The upbeat and catchy “Call” embodies the dance- and house-inspired mission of the album. The track also has hip-hop influences that make it reminiscent of a rap instrumental, yet Bundick provides the complexity to make it a song on its own. The cinematic “Toy” is suspenseful and powerful, like the soundtrack accompanying a climactic film scene.
Bundick complements his beats with wisely-chosen sampling. The sources of these samples range from Nas tracks to jazz riffs. The album opens with a sample of a British interviewer saying, “Talk about your newest record”; this sets an interesting meta-music tone for the album, as if perhaps the whole album is the response to this demand. The rest of this track, “Talk About,” is dominated by a sample of a line from the iconic “One Love” by Nas, “Guess who got shot in the dome-piece? / Jerome’s niece.” While most of the samples are unrecognizable to the average listener, this one is familiar to many. Though this line is so known, Bundick has made it his own. Another great use of sampling is “Bother,” where Bundick samples his own voice. This is interesting because he has made it clear in interviews that unlike Toro y Moi, Les Sins isn’t about his vocals at all. However, his voice forms the base of “Bother,” layered over a clappy instrumental and background talking noises. He actually uses his voice as just another element in a beat. The way he mixes, repeats, and chops one spoken sentence makes it musical and even catchy.
“Why,” featuring Nate Salman, is structured fundamentally differently from the rest of the songs. It is a disco-influenced track that makes ample use of virtually unknown singer Nate Salman’s vocals. The only song on the album with radio potential, “Why” is definitely not an instrumental piece, which the other tracks all are to varying degrees. The vocals are skilled and impressively versatile, seemingly dominating this song, but Bundick’s production is not lost, layering Salman’s vocals in creative ways. Bundick told Noisey that his mission for this album was to “get people to recognize a good electronic track.” “Why” is his best chance to get those who typically aren’t into electronic music to appreciate it. However, it has so much mass appeal as to feel somewhat out of place on the album. It is a great song by itself, but its style feels radically different from the others.
On “Michael,” Bundick redefines his role in the music he makes, producing rather than singing or writing lyrics while remaining a lead figure in the creative process. He is adept at genre switching, and this album is true to its dance and electronic goal while remaining authentically his. Carving out an artistic vision can be hard when operating under different musical aliases, but Bundick has managed to keep Les Sins as a coherent and separate identity from Toro y Moi. By providing Bundick with a platform that focuses on production rather than lyrical elements, “Michael” explores the potential that producing can add to the accomplished musician’s arsenal.

“Semper fi, do or die!” is something of a mantra in the musical “Dogfight,” which follows the struggle of young marine Eddie Birdlace (Derek P. Speedy ’18) as he tries to hold on to his humanity in the hours preceding his deployment to Vietnam. In the musical, the marines have a tradition they call the Dogfight, in which each marine has to find the ugliest girl he can convince to accompany him to a party that evening. The marine whose date is judged to be the most ugly wins the pot. Eddie Birdlace finds the idealistic, inexperienced Rose (Taylor K. Phillips ’15) in a diner and convinces her to come along. When he begins to question the morality of subjecting Rose to the Dogfight, it is already too late. In the spirit of “Semper fi, do or die!” he trudges on.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production perfectly captures the whirlwind of passion its young characters experience. The production—directed by Cole V. Edick ’17—fluidly shifts from lighthearted song-and-dance numbers to moving moments of quiet and sadness. Moreover, the actors infuse an occasionally clichéd storyline with life and emotion through effective singing and acting.
Running in the blackbox Loeb Experimental Theater, the show’s set design (Ana P. Marinovic '16) is sparse. “Enlist Today!” propaganda posters and pictures of San Francisco hang on the walls, but the stage is otherwise devoid of fixed set pieces. Instead, the production uses a dynamic set in which the actors pull furniture on and offstage, often as part of choreographed dance numbers. The ever-changing set follows the constant caprices of the show’s characters and allows the musical to maintain a fast pace.
In fact, the action rarely stops in “Dogfight.” It is a testament to the ability of the actors that they manage to keep up with the pace of the show. Actors go through costume changes on stage while singing. They make set changes while dancing. The actors were visibly dripping with sweat at multiple times in the show, but they never missed a beat.
The fast, lighthearted song numbers show off the singing ability of the cast, particularly in the scenes where all of the marines sing together in a sort of boyish abandon. In songs “Some Kinda Time,” and “Hometown Hero’s Ticker Tape Parade,” the tenor-heavy group harmonizes beautifully and dances with vigor. In these youthful and energetic numbers, the audience really believes that this is group of naïve boys who do not know what is ahead of them.
The few slow moments in the show are also powerful. The romance between the characters Birdlace and Rose is believable: Speedy and Phillips capture the early awkwardness between their characters, but before long they let their defenses down and work together with powerful chemistry. With a bright and confident voice, Speedy is undoubtedly the star of this show, and yet he does not overpower Phillips in their duets. Phillips, for her part, plays the incredibly vulnerable role of Rose impressively. Singing in a meek yet beautiful croon, she displays all the character’s insecurities without relying on stereotypes.
In the intimacy of the Loeb Ex, the experience of the show becomes even more personal. The cast members stand level with the audience, only a few feet away. In one scene, where Birdlace is in a moment of distress and confusion, Speedy stares directly into the eyes of the audience with discomforting closeness. When he is angry and yells at his fellow marines, we see the spit flying from Speedy’s mouth and the veins bulging in his temples. There is nowhere to hide on the open stage, no room for deception. All that happens is there for the audience to see—raw and human.
“Dogfight” effortlessly blends pomp with poignancy. It avoids traditional musical trappings and treats its weighty subject matter with respect. By the second act, when guns start firing, the audience has grown personally attached to the characters. We want them to turn back, but the young marines do not have an option. Feigning confidence, they let out a “Semper fi, do or die!” and head into the void.

While it may come as a surprise, Shakespeare only wrote of part of “Pericles, Prince of Tyre.” The other half is most likely penned by another writer, George Wilkins. In the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s latest incarnation of this romance, “Pericles” will add even more collaborators as a cast and crew of Harvard students bring their own ideas to the table.
Director Matthew H. Munroe ’17 interprets the play as a search for family. The play begins with Pericles’s search for a wife. He soon wins the hand of the beautiful Thaisa. Pericles is unfortunately separated from both his wife and his daughter, Marina. The play then follows Marina as she encounters her own ordeals.
The serious dramatic plot points of prostitution, piracy, and murder are considerable obstacles to the family’s reunion, yet a sense of optimism prevails. The focus of the story is on how each character overcomes their obstacles. “[The story] is more like being swept along by this journey,” Munroe says. “[It] has a such a storytelling feel that it didn’t make sense to me to present it as a drama.”
The setting of “Pericles” is fantastically changed, taking place in a circus. “The whole concept for the show is that we’re a traveling circus troupe,” Michaela J. Kane ’18 (who plays the role of the narrator, Gower) says. “The narrator is the ringmaster of the circus, Thaisa is an acrobat, Marina’s a tightrope walker, Cleon is a flame artist, and Pericles is lion tamer. Which is kind of cool. But there are no lions. Sorry.”
Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 who will be playing Dionyza, Bawd, Second Fisherman, and Daughter, indicated that her favorite moments in the play are the most chaotic ones. “The fact that it’s set as a circus is a really fun innovation, and there’s a lot of going in and out of tents and changing costumes,” she says.“There’s a part where one of the characters gets stolen by pirates.”
Munroe added that there will be some fun cast-audience interaction during the show: “The actors are going to be interacting with the audience at points.”  It seems ready to be a rowdy Shakespearean tribute—using the original script, but with creative new staging and costumes.

For some in Massachusetts, ghouls and goblins were not the only creatures that haunted our houses last weekend. The specter of Daylight Savings Time too crept in the night, and with it came the dread of blacker, earlier evenings for the rest of the year.
Criticism of Daylight Savings Time resurges every year, and in spite of the immediate benefit of an extra hour of sleep the first night the clocks change in fall, many complain that 4:30 p.m. sunsets are sufficiently repugnant to endorse stopping the practice altogether. A piece published in the Boston Globe last month proposed that Massachusetts switch to Atlantic Standard Time, igniting particular interest again in the topic this fall. Though the piece’s conclusions in favor of upending the status quo are interesting, they are not compelling.
The argument turns on the question of how the shift away from Daylight Savings Time would be implemented. Tom Emswiler suggests in the Globe that Massachusetts should lead the charge and move to Atlantic Standard Time, which would be the equivalent of "keeping the clock an hour forward all year". The benefits of this switch, other than simply a later sunset, would apparently be medical, environmental, and psychological. Even if other northeastern states were to decide against such a switch, Emswiller still thinks Massachusetts would benefit: "New England,” he says, “should join a time zone more suited to us, not one that works for New York".
Massachusetts does not exist in isolation. Whatever economic and health benefits may arise in Massachusetts due to this switch will surely be offset by the utter confusion this will cause in interstate travel. According to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, over 165,000 workers "commute into Massachusetts from... surrounding states" every single day.This problem is much more pertinent to Massachusetts than to Hawaii or Arizona, the two states that currently operate under a plan like that proposed by Emswiller. Cell phones in Hawaii and Arizona did not change time last Sunday, but Hawaii does not have to worry about daily interstate commuters at all, and Arizona’s largest metropolitan area—Phoenix—is located entirely within the state, while the Boston metropolitan area extends to Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.
Further, Emswiler barely considers the immediate economic impacts of creating a new time zone in Massachusetts. Massachusetts must gain approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the cost in bureaucratic man-hours and paper will not be negligible, no matter how well the initiative is packaged. The conversion to Atlantic Standard Time would also overlook many farmers, blue-collar workers, and some students who must get up early. If the psychological effects of an early sunset are considered to be significant enough to engender a switch in time zones, surely everyone must be accounted for.
Massachusetts may be known as an ever-innovating state, ready to embrace popular ideas at a pace unmatched by most. But when it comes to its evening hours, the state shouldn’t be afraid of the dark.

A recent investigation of the horrid conditions suffered by ISIS hostages sheds light on a disconcerting reality: A hostage’s nationality very often determines his or her fate. Of the at least 23 foreigners kidnapped by Syrian insurgents since 2012, the vast majority has been freed in exchange for large ransoms, while every American and Briton—from countries with strict no-ransom policies—has either been killed or remains in captivity.
And so continues the disturbing trend in disparate and incompatible policies on ransom payments to terrorist organizations: Some nations are willing to pay to bring their nationals home while others are not. While publically denying paying ransoms, certain countries—mainly in Europe and Qatar—have paid considerable sums to end hostage situations.
A New York Times investigation found that France, for example, has paid almost $60 million to al-Qaeda and its affiliates since 2008. In May 2014, Italians allegedly paid ISIS to release countryman Federico Motka; in 2009 Switzerland reportedly paid al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb 8 million euros for three hostages.
Ransom has become an important source of revenue for terrorist groups in the Middle East. Since 2008, at least $125 million in ransom has been paid to al-Qaeda and its affiliates, including a single 30 million euro payment in 2013 for four French nationals. Abu Bashir, head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, wrote in 2012 that the “precious treasure” of hostage financing accounts for roughly half of the group’s revenue.
In contrast, the United States has refused ransom demands. In 1980, after Iranian revolutionaries kidnapped 52 Americans, President Carter famously made the American policy clear: “The United States will not yield to blackmail.” In 2002 President Bush repeated the American position: “We, of course, don’t pay ransom for any hostages.” In 2014 when ISIS captors of American journalist James Foley demanded payment for his release, America refused.
The policy has horrible consequences for those held in captivity, evidenced by the brutal beheadings of James Foley and others. Yet, the rationale remains sounds. Paying ransom incurs greater future damages by financing terrorist organizations and creates incentive for more kidnappings. The perpetuation of kidnappings from ransom payments has been well studied. In fact, Americans are kidnapped at a far lower rate than Europeans.
However, for this policy to be effective, we need a unified international commitment to stop ransom payments. To disrupt the financial stability of terrorist groups requires all countries to cooperate. Further, difference in policies puts more people at risk by creating inflated expectations for captors. When Moscow failed to meet ransom demands, ISIS members shot Russian Sergey Gorbunov and told the other hostages: “This is what will happen to you if your government doesn’t pay.”
Indeed, there have been empty commitments from the international community to refrain from such payments. In 2013 the G8 announced that the nations would “unequivocally reject the payment of ransom to terrorists.” Further, in January 2014 the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution that called upon members to prevent terrorist organizations from receiving ransom funding.
We need a faithful dedication to a unified international policy on how to deal with hostage negotiations. This will require painful decisions from the nations that currently pay ransoms. In any hostage situation, it makes sense that a country will do everything responsible to bring its citizens home safely. However, we must refrain from paying ransoms, trusting the logic that they only hurt in the long run.
Further, a unified policy requires mutual pressure. The United States has not publically condemned European nations for paying ransoms for hostages. Even though this remains an incredibly sensitive issue, countries must be held to the standards that they have previously committed to—especially when the consequences are so steep.
The current disparity benefits no one. Instead a unified, international front is needed to stop funding terrorist groups and perpetuating their kidnappings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Education at elite universities has always been under close scrutiny, but in recent months the attacks have been coming fast and furious—and some even here at Harvard have been on the defensive. On the heels of the heated debate about Ivy League education that William Deresiewicz’s New Republic piece provoked, University President Drew G. Faust made a “Case for College.” Her arguments address a broader crisis in higher education, in which families (and educators) are rethinking the value of a college education.
Harvard is not like most institutions of higher education. But when Harvard acts, others take note. Harvard has the opportunity to set an example of what a college education should be.
I graduated from the College in 2008, and now I am back as a graduate student and teaching fellow in the History Department. Seeing undergraduate education from the TF perspective has been eye-opening. There are many problems I was oblivious to as an undergrad, but the most striking of all is the lack of investment in TF-led discussion sections. In my view, the large size of sections—often 18, not infrequently 20, sometimes even 25—is one of the most blatant signs of Harvard’s failure to prioritize undergraduate education.
A primary metric of undergraduate education sold to prospective students is class size. The Harvard admissions website touts its “small classes,” reporting a median class size of 12, and only 15% of classes with more than 30 students.
But these figures tell us very little about the average student experience. Median class size allows large classes to be ignored entirely. By virtue of enrolling many more students, those 15% of classes make up a much greater proportion of students’ experience. Most importantly, these stats make no mention of the large bulk of undergraduate learning that happens in sections and lab groups, taught by TFs. While Harvard now has 1,574 assistant, associate, and tenured faculty members, Harvard also employs another 1,400 graduate assistants to do most of the day-to-day teaching. It is these TFs who lead discussions, supervise labs, grade assignments and exams, meet with students in office hours, and often write recommendation letters.
Despite the obvious appeal of small classes, the Office of Undergraduate Education sets a “target” of 18 students per section. The implementation of this target was a product of the 2008 financial crisis, when Harvard decided the best way to cut corners was to shift funding away from this central component of undergraduate learning. And it's even worse in practice: A “target” is an average, meaning any individual section could have more than 18. According to an Undergraduate Council survey, 30% of respondents have had sections of 19 or more.
This problem is what inspired a group of graduate students to start the Harvard Teaching Campaign—an initiative to cap sections and lab groups at 12. According to the same survey, close to 90% of respondents believed the ideal section size to be 12 or fewer. Currently, the campaign is gathering signatures to get a referendum question included in the upcoming UC election.
Preserving Harvard’s liberal arts college within a larger research university has been the stated priority of the Dean of the College, Rakesh Khurana. But lately, those arguments have focused on non-academic sides of undergraduate life. FAS approved spending a total of $355.2 million on housing renewal, and $99.8 million in 2014 alone. According to the latest FAS Annual Report, this is the “one of the largest and most ambitious capital improvement efforts in Harvard College history.”
At the University level, Harvard has poured millions into online learning initiatives. But according to multiple studies of its first pilot program in “blended-format courses,” the pedagogical benefits are far from conclusive. In fact, a “key finding” was that students “still wanted in-person interactions with faculty and among themselves. They said that sections—small-group discussions outside the class―were especially vital, enabling feedback, time for Q&A, meaningful collaborations, and a deeper sense of intellectual community.” Students know that there’s no substitute for in-person learning experiences.
As fundamentally and foremost an academic institution, Harvard should prioritize classroom learning. Cost should not be an issue. In fact, I’ll borrow from Khurana, who, when defending the inefficiency of having 12 dining halls, argued, “It’s not about efficiency, it’s about effectiveness…If you understand that, you won’t use minimizing cost as the measure of the value we are creating.” If this holds true for dining halls, it should also hold for section size.
Historically, Harvard has been a trendsetter. It can and should set an example of excellence in education to which others can aspire.
So, Harvard. Set the bar high.

Economics and love have had something of a dysfunctional relationship. Which is to say, economics keeps sending texts while love is so over economics already.
Scholars of love have always looked at economics with skepticism. In “On the Present Age”, the 19th century Danish existentialist Søren Kierkegaard lamented the modern preoccupation with money over love. Personal growth could come only from love and spirituality, nor the worldly pursuit of wealth. The 20th century philosophers McCartney and Lennon concluded along similar lines that “money can’t buy me love.”
In their personal lives, economists have certainly not shied away from romance. The eminent Harvard economist Joseph Schumpeter once claimed that his three goals in life were to be the greatest economist in the world, the best horseman in all of Austria, and the greatest lover in Vienna. Later in life, Schumpeter said that he’d achieved two out of the three—and that there were far too many good equestrians in Austria.
But in the realm of theory, outside of kinked demand curves and the Slutsky equation, economists have largely avoided romance. The economics of fertility is a growing and important field, but there has been comparatively little study of the process that makes fertility possible. Could the most joyful of human activities benefit from some analysis by the dismal science?
From the standpoint of Homo Economicus, the romantic market is inefficient. Love is dependent on the mutual coincidence of wants. Person A may like person B, but if B isn’t interested in A, there can be no romantic exchange. (It probably does not take a Harvard economics degree to realize this.) In other words, love is a barter economy. Introducing a common currency, tradable for affection, would theoretically increase the number of transactions and improve aggregate utility.
But alas, human beings form specific and often exclusive preferences. Anyone who has felt the pangs of unrequited affection, or been the object of such attention, knows that love for one and love for another are rarely substitutes. Such a currency would fail miserably.
If economic theory cannot improve the structure of the romantic marketplace, maybe we can improve the decision-making capacity of individual actors.
Finance may have some lessons for romantic choice. Romance, like investment, should be forward-looking. Exes and old flames are sunk costs; dwelling on them is not only illogical but also counterproductive. Also, with uncertain knowledge of the future, diversification is key. Playing the field may protect an agent from unforeseen shocks to the dating market (perhaps Tinder was invented to fill this need for low-cost variety). By the same logic, infatuation is suboptimal, the romantic equivalent of putting all your savings in gold. Both positions are immature, irrational and shortsighted.
For anyone who has felt love’s joys and sorrows, probably none of this article’s observations are new—they have just been reframed in the technical language of economics. When caught in the heat of the moment, it is difficult to see anyone calculating marginal cost and marginal benefit. Advice about love is easy to give, difficult to receive, and even harder to implement. When that advice is given in terms of utility functions and portfolio choice, it is unlikely to be stimulative.
What makes romantic love worthwhile is its inexplicability. Love is not rational, and so it cannot be reduced to the bloodless equations of utility maximization. In the realm of romance, Homo Economicus—the author, not the concept—will freely admit that he is a sucker. He can aspire to none of Schumpeter’s three goals, and not just because he bombed his last economics midterm and can’t ride a horse.
Some things deserve to be outside the realm of economics. Homo Economicus can remain happily confused.

It’s cold, wet, and I’m waiting outside of Winthrop G entry for an interview. Luckily, I have my phone to keep me company, and I am happily jamming to Pandora, keeping an eye on my steadily growing email inbox, and browsing Facebook to pass the time. My phone and I have a close relationship. His name is Theodore.
According to the Pew Research Center, in 2013, 78% of teenagers were the proud owners of cellphones, 47% of which were smartphones. As one such teen, I think it's safe to say that many could not imagine life without one. However, even at Harvard, where access to e-mail and texting is almost as necessary as access to oxygen, some students choose to go without today’s most ubiquitous form of communication.
When moving to Cambridge from Toronto, Nestor Maslej '17 purchased a new, American phone, which, in the tradition of American-built products, promptly broke. To fix it, he needed to travel out to rural Massachusetts. However, he soon realized that not having a phone jived with his lifestyle, and he ended up putting off the trip.
“It's not essential, I think,” Maslej says, but acknowledges that owning a cellphone can be helpful. “If I want to get dinner with a friend without a phone I'd have to say four hours before: do you want to get dinner? Whereas with a phone I could text him five minutes before, and see what happens.” In these cases, Facebook and a computer can easily step into the role of immediate communication, making a phone less essential than one might think.
Maslej has a phone now, but he still doesn't consider it a vital part of his life. “I'm not glued to my phone, I don't even have it on me right now. I have no phone addiction. I usually don't carry it around with me.” He views it as just another tool, and not something integral, like many can. “Your life can be in your phone. My life was not in my phone. To some extent I think everyone has that sort of outlet of wasting time and that's what the phone can serve as.”
Corey C. Husic ’17 also finds that having a phone isn’t strongly necessary. “I've had friends tell me: ‘How can you live without a phone, how can you keep in contact?’” says Corey C. Husic '17. “But with Facebook, and having a computer, they pretty much do everything I need.”
“I've always had this appreciation for nature, and when I go out in nature I want to put everything else aside,” notes Husic. “A lot of times going out in nature is just my time to reflect on myself, and reflect on what's happened with my life. And if I give other people the ability to reach out to me and know where I am in those moments that kind of detracts from my own personal meditation.”
Whereas most students also use their phones for entertainment, Husic finds enjoyment in the three-dimensional world around him. “If I'm on a bus going home for the holidays, I can just look out the window. I'm very much an outdoors person, very much appreciative of nature.”
Still, the lure of a phone is strong, even for the phoneless. “I've definitely considered getting a phone. It's probable it'll happen before I graduate,” admits Husic. Safety concerns, or the inevitable need to beg a roommate to come help you retrieve your wallet, are strong arguments for joining the cellphone revolution.
I ask Husic to imagine a world where all of Harvard inexplicably loses their collective phones. “I think a lot more work would get done,” he muses. “I think if people didn't have their phones they'd have a lot more free time be spending doing intellectual work. But I think people would be just fine. It would take a little getting used to, but everything would be fine.”
“Right now, I'm happy,” he states contentedly. Perhaps more Harvard students should consider trying to go without them, he suggests, and see if these reasons hold true for them too. But on the way out of the building, I give Theodore a gentle rub. Neither he, nor I, is going anywhere anytime soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 5, 2014, at 1:00 p.m.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously voted to request that University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation reverse the new health benefits policy—unveiled earlier this year—on the eve of its planned implementation.
History professor Mary D. Lewis made a motion at the Faculty’s monthly meeting initiating the vote. A tense back and forth followed between administrators defending the new policy and FAS professors, loudly applauding each other after each statement that condemned the changes.
FAS members received comments from guests of other Harvard faculties—invited to speak in favor of the policy—with less deference, laughing at one speaker’s assertion that hospital visits are not recipes for health.
Their debate—which lasted beyond the meeting’s scheduled end time, requiring a vote to extend it—culminated with a vote an hour after the initial motion was made.
The motion, as filed last week, asks “that for 2015 the President and Fellows be asked to replace the currently proposed health care benefit plan with an appropriately adjusted version of the 2014 health benefit package, maintaining the 2014 plan design.”
It does not require that Faust or the Corporation take any action but does stand as the official stance of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s most influential professorial body.
Faust told The Crimson after the meeting that she would be “replying in due course.” She did not offer further comment.
After the meeting, Lewis said she can envision several options for moving forward. She wrote that "the University could change the policy to maintain the 2014 plan design by renegotiating with its vendors, which would probably entail extending the current open enrollment period.  Failing that, it could create a temporary reimbursement fund to compensate faculty and staff while awaiting a return to the 2014 policy, offering a second open enrollment period later in the academic year."
Faculty members have principally criticized the plan for its introduction of deductibles for non-routine health appointments and the introduction of copays. Under the new plans, employees we be liable to pay up to $1,500 a person and up to $4,500 a year for families of three or more out of pocket to cover copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and drug costs.
All of the non-administrative members of FAS who spoke on Tuesday expressed their disapproval for the new policy, in turn calling it an unnecessary measure, effectively a pay cut, and an unfair reallocation of risk to the most vulnerable members of the community.
Mathematics professor Mark Kisin said that whether or not the University’s claims about reducing costs while maintaining health outcomes are true, there are other costs associated with the policy change, including decreased attention to research and teaching because professors will be distracted by their healthcare costs. Kisin also suggested that the policy would damage the Harvard brand and reputation for providing strong health care benefits and disproportionately harm female faculty members.
During the meeting, however, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 maintained that the changes were necessary to reduce the University’s health care costs. He said the University Benefits Committee, which recommended the policy changes, would continue to look for ways to “improve what we offer to our faculty and staff."    
Two Medical School professors defended the health care policy, saying that Harvard’s changes were in line with shifts at peer institutions and other companies throughout the country. The two professors do not hold FAS appointments.
Furthermore, Garber defended the changes based on an empirical study conducted by Medical School professor Joseph P. Newhouse ’63 that showed through a randomized experiment that increasing cost-sharing reduced health care usage while not harming health outcomes among employed adults.
Garber acknowledged that while this result  may be counterintuitive and the study is old, it does provide the best empirical data that is available today.
Ahead of the meeting, several members of the UBC penned an op-ed defending the changes in The Crimson on Tuesday.
Around 20 professors interviewed by The Crimson almost unanimously praised the motion after the meeting let out.
“It was a great moment for faculty, total dissent,” History professor Carter J. Eckert said after the meeting. “It was a complete rejection on the part of the faculty.”
Although English professor Deidre S. Lynch said she would not describe the discussion as “angry,” she said after the meeting that “a lot of us felt as if the committee that decided the benefits condescended to us.”
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, who seconded Lewis’s motion, called the result “resounding” after the meeting. “I don’t think this is where Harvard wants to go,” he said of the new benefits policy. “This looks like more of a corporate policy.”
The meeting drew noticeably greater numbers than is usual, with many attendees sitting on the floor.
“I don’t come every time, but this time I came for this reason,” said Romance Languages and Literature professor Francesco Erspamer.
Lewis said she was “heartened” by the high attendance at the meeting, noting that professors currently on sabbatical were present.
History professor Alison Frank Johnson, a vocal critic of the changes who spoke at the meeting, said afterwards that she was moved by the actions of her colleagues. “It was supportive and deeply thoughtful and I think outraged but in a respectful way,” she said. “I’m proud to be a member of this community right now. We came together to share our thoughts and concerns.”
Also during the meeting, the Faculty heard a presentation on the five-year review of the human development and regenerative biology concentration.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith also discussed a proposed motion that would slightly change the procedure for expulsion and dismissal of students, introducing a requirement that decisions be reached by a vote of two-thirds of Faculty Council present and voting. Currently, the decision must be agreed upon by two-thirds of the 18-person council, regardless of attendance.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification
CLARIFICATION: Novemebr 5, 2014
An earlier version of this article stated that under the new benefits plans, individuals would be liable for up to $1,500 in copays and families of three or more liable up to $4,500. To clarify, those out of pocket maximum figures include copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and drug costs.

Five tickets will run in the upcoming Undergraduate Council elections, the highest number of competitors in the past six years. Of those tickets, presidential and vice presidential hopefuls Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 are sophomores—a rare occurrence in a race that is typically dominated by juniors.
Potential candidates had from last Sunday to this Monday at midnight to garner 150 signatures in order to be automatically placed on the ballot.
Four tickets—Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16  and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Ema H. Horvath ’16, Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16, and Heine and Turban, who are all running for president and vice president respectively—submitted candidate declaration forms well before the deadline.
The fifth ticket, Michael J. Landry ’16 and Connor M. Harris ’16, turned in the intention to run form only about an hour before the deadline, according to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
Still, Landry and Harris, like all other candidates, gathered the required signatures and will begin campaigning in about a week.
Estes described the five competing tickets as a “pretty historic” number. Last year’s election featured three pairs, and five tickets have not run in a single election since 2008, according to information from a 2013 UC report on gender parity.
Before official campaigning begins, candidates are expected to organize their supporters and attend a mandatory rules information session, the date of which has yet to be determined, Estes said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Technology companies and the federal government are locked in an escalating legal battle over data surveillance and consumer rights, said Microsoft’s General Counsel Brad Smith at a Law School forum Tuesday.
Smith, the executive vice president for legal and corporate affairs at Microsoft, spoke to a packed room in Wasserstein Hall about the erosion of trust in technology in light of recent reports of government digital surveillance.
“You cannot restore trust without greater transparency. Now the question is, how?” he said.
Conversing with Law School Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who moderated the forum, Smith argued that the U.S. government must respect both domestic and international privacy laws, instead of unilaterally and opaquely obtaining data. Microsoft and other technology companies filed a lawsuit against the government earlier this year, claiming that the U.S. government should not be allowed to snoop in emails and other files housed overseas, he said.
“When should the United States government be able to reach into a data center built in another country to get the data inside?” he asked. “That really goes to the heart of sovereignty. It basically means that whenever an American company builds a building in another country, that building is subject to the sovereign reach of the United States government.”
Smith also discussed the potential for international conflict if, for example, China or Iran built a data center in the U.S. to shelter files from their country of origin.
“This is where one creates a real risk of fostering chaos on the internet,” he said. “Are people going to continue to be able to have the confidence that their rights are going to be protected by their own constitutions? Or is it something that will be overridden by other governments and their laws?”
In light of the day’s midterm elections, Smith predicted that a continued legislative stalemate would place the burden of mediation between technology companies and the government on the federal courts.
“One of the defining trends of our time, polarization of politics, is leading to a gridlock[ed] Congress,” he said. “We’ll see what happens in the elections today, but in an era of gridlock, we should probably expect more court action.”
David E. Sanger ’82, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, asked whether the battle between private data encryption and government code-breaking would amount to a technological arms race.
“In the tug-of-war between government and technology, the arms race has already started,” responded Smith. “In the absence of any real discussion, we’re just going to have an arms race in perpetuity.”

Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol admitted at Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to using cameras placed in classrooms to take photographs of attendance without telling the surveilled faculty and students.
Bol’s comments came in response to a question from Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who said he learned of the photographing—which took place during the spring 2014 semester—from two of his colleagues.
The two unidentified colleagues, neither of whom are tenured, first learned about the surveillance when a senior Central Administration official called them in to discuss the results, Lewis said in his question. The students who were enrolled in these courses and photographed have not yet been told of the study.
“Just because technology can be used to answer a question doesn’t mean that it should be,” Lewis said. “And if you watch people electronically and don’t tell them ahead of time, you should tell them afterwards.”
Lewis ended his question by asking University President Drew G. Faust to promise that all students and faculty involved will be informed that the photographs were taken.
Faust first deferred the question to Bol, who justified the electronic monitoring as part of a larger research effort to study student attendance in lectures. The study was part of the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, which falls under Bol’s purview.
After speaking with the professors whose classes were monitored in August, Bol offered them the option of either removing data from their course completely from the study, retaining the data while masking the name of the course, or including the data with the course name. Every professor whom Bol spoke with chose to include data with their course name, he said.
In an email after the meeting, Bol said that he would, “in short order, work to inform all of the students in the courses involved in the study about the fact that their images may have been taken, but were subsequently destroyed."
Prior to beginning the study, Bol said, he was given approval by Harvard’s Institutional Review Board, a federally mandated body that assesses academic research. According to Bol, members of that committee said that his work “did not constitute human subjects research,” and, as such, did not require notification or permission of those involved.
Bol said at the meeting that in the wake of this surveillance, the IRB will now automatically refer all internal studies involving undergraduate students to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education if the study does not entail human subjects research. “This was a gap in procedures that is being resolved,” Bol wrote in an email after the meeting, saying the Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Education will be consulted in the future.
Following Bol’s comments, Faust added that she would refer the study to an oversight committee that was formed based on the advisement of a task force on email surveillance chaired by former Law School professor David J. Barron ’89.
"I indeed do take very seriously the important questions that this incident raises," Faust said. "I wish to submit this incident to [the committee] for comment and exploration. I think that was what the committee was set up to do.”
German professor Peter J. Burgard asked how the instance did not qualify as “spying,” adding that while the University has cameras in place for security and protection, the study was “Orwellian” in nature.
Mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid said after the meeting that news of the surveillance “does make me slightly uncomfortable, I must say, even after being given the explanation.”
Brett M. Biebelberg '16, an Undergraduate Council representative for Quincy House and chair of the Council’s Rules Committee who was at Tuesday’s meeting, criticized the surveillance.
“It’s just another instance of contradiction when we have a University that’s pushing and pushing and pushing the implementation of an honor code that requires students to attest to their honor and integrity, yet here we have yet another example of the University engaging in activities in which it’s not being forthright, it's being secretive, and it's withholding information from students and professors that could potentially be used against them,” he said.
Others disagreed with that characterization. After Tuesday’s meeting, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Gonzalo Giribet and Economics professor Jerry R. Green said they did not consider the surveillance to be spying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Novemeber 5, 2014, at 1:20 a.m.
Two Harvard Medical School professors who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in defense of the University’s new health care policy were present in violation of FAS policies.
According to the FAS rules of faculty procedure, the “Dean of the Faculty, in consultation with the elected members of the Docket Committee, may invite guests to attend meetings of the Faculty as observers. Special permission of the Dean, in consultation with the Docket Committee, is required before guests may be invited to speak.”
But Classics professor Emma Dench, vice-chair of the docket committee, said that the committee was not asked whether the two HMS professors, Joseph Newhouse and Barbara J. McNeil, could attend the meeting or speak.
“I can confirm that we were not consulted about this matter and did not know that [non-FAS] professors would be speaking tonight,” Dench wrote in an email.
Another docket committee member said he did not remember being consulted.
In consultation with FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s office, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 invited McNeil and Newhouse, both members of the University Benefits Committee, to Tuesday’s meeting, according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Smith, while a member of the docket committee, is not elected to it but serves as its chair as FAS dean. FAS policies indicate that “elected” members of the committee be consulted.
Other than Garber, the two visitors were the only speakers at Tuesday’s meeting in support of the University’s health care policy. In a unanimous vote, the Faculty called on University President Drew G. Faust and the Corporation to reverse the changes to the benefits plans.
Faust made a point of calling on the two Medical School professors before some members of FAS who were speaking out against the new policy, alternating between supporters and critics.
At least two FAS professors—Classics professor Richard F. Thomas and Sociology professor Christopher Winship—wanted to speak at Tuesday’s meeting but did not have time, even after the meeting was extended by 20 minutes.
University professor Marc W. Kirschner was present and spoke in favor of the motion reversing the policy, though History professor Mary D. Lewis made a point of saying Kirschner was attending the meeting in his capacity as University professor—an appointment that spans all of Harvard’s faculties—during her initial motion.

Jincey Lumpkin, BGLTQ activist and founder of feminist lesbian pornography studio Juicy Pink Box, gave a presentation Tuesday night about her experience breaking into the porn industry as one of the first female pornographers to go mainstream.
Her talk was organized by the Harvard student group Sexual Health Education & Advocacy (SHEATH) for the third annual Harvard Sex Week. The series of events is about sex, intimacy, love, and relationships, and was initiated in the spring of 2012.
According to SHEATH co-President Kirin Gupta ’16, Harvard Sex Week this year places particular emphasis on how intersectional identities such as race and ethnicity impact sex and relationships, as SHEATH has created new partnerships with various cultural groups. This sentiment of inclusion was echoed in Lumpkin’s talk, although it focused more on recognizing different sexual preferences.
“I saw a hole in the marketplace in terms of the kind of porn I wanted to see,” Lumpkin said. Lumpkin is a sex columnist for the Huffington Post and has been called the “lesbian Hugh Hefner.”
In 2009, Lumpkin founded the pornography studio with aims to highlight authentic lesbian porn—meaning no fake orgasms—for both homosexual and heterosexual female audiences.
“Women have been robbed of their sexual agency for thousands of years, and it was important to me to take control of that,” Lumpkin said. “That’s why I started this business.”
Lumpkin said that she strives to create only “ethical porn,” in which actresses are paid fair wages, scene boundaries are negotiated before filming, and stars are reimbursed for medical testing.
However, although personal agency is a driving force in Lumpkin’s business model, Sam A. Garin ’17 disagreed with the idea that a company can equitably profit from the use of women’s bodies.“I’m not quite convinced that porn can ultimately be feminist, especially for queer women,” Garin said.
Lumpkin acknowledged the differing opinions of other self-identified feminists. She did note, however, that sex will become increasingly integrated into regular entertainment, which highlights the importance of starting conversations about sex.
“There’s not going to be a need for porn.... We’re going to see a lot more sex on cable T.V.,” Lumpkin said.
Lumpkin also argued that more money and time should be devoted to informational programming like Harvard Sex Week. The event series kicked off with an interactive workshop on South Asian sexuality last Sunday and will run until Saturday, Nov. 8.

On Tuesday, former Kirkland House tutor Eric P. Lesser ’07 secured the Massachusetts State Senate seat for the First Hampden and Hampshire District, which consists of eastern Springfield and surrounding towns.
Lesser was expected to do well after receiving high-profile Democratic endorsements on his behalf, most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren. He received 51 percent of the vote, according to the Associated Press, with 90 percent of precincts reporting.
A third year student at the Law School who resided in Kirkland during his time in the College, Lesser left in January to secure the Democratic nomination.
Many students and tutors who had been residing in Kirkland helped with the campaign this summer and fall, according to Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley, who added that students from the Springfield area were excited to hear of his campaign.
In the spring, the House Masters hosted a fundraiser dinner for Lesser’s campaign in their residence.

BOSTON—Maura T. Healey '92 won the race for Massachusetts Attorney General Tuesday night, becoming the first openly gay person to be elected attorney general in the United States.
Healey, a Democrat, defeated Republican opponent John Miller by capturing 62.9 percent of the statewide vote, according to the Associated Press, with 90 percent of precincts reporting. Healey was a co-captain of the Harvard women's basketball team while at the College.
With seven years of experience serving in the attorney general's office under Martha Coakley as chief of the civil rights, public protection, and business and labor bureaus, Healey ran on an activist platform with emphasis on civil rights, consumer protection, and economic and housing inequality. She defeated state senator Warren Tolman in the Democratic primary in September.
"As Attorney General, I'm going to be the people's lawyer, and I'm going to be your advocate," Healey said to a crowded room of supporters at the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston Tuesday night. "I need your help in all the challenges that we'll face ahead. Together, I know what we've already accomplished together, and I know what we can accomplish ahead."
William “Mo” Cowan, who served as interim U.S. Senator from Massachusetts in 2013, introduced Healey on Tuesday evening.
"Maura didn't start with big pocket donors, but she has something more important: she had experience and she had the courage to run," Cowan said. "And she had you—she had all of us—she had the energy that only comes from a truly grassroots campaign. And what a campaign it has been."
In her speech, Healey, who several times referred to herself as "The People's Lawyer," reiterated her commitment to fighting for the progressive issues that she highlighted in her campaign. She also emphasized her strong opposition to casinos within Massachusetts and her advocacy for the repeal of the state's gaming laws. "I'll hold their feet to the fire," she said.
"I am really excited to see an openly gay woman in this position," said Jeffrey R. Nagengast, a Healey supporter who attended the watch party. "As a gay male, I am really proud to have Healey as attorney general."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 5, 2014, at 3:51 a.m.
BOSTON––Once a longshot in the polls, Republican Charles D. Baker ’79 will be the next governor of Massachusetts after defeating Democratic Attorney General Martha M. Coakley in statewide voting on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press.
Baker, who served in the cabinets of two Republican governors in the 1990s and is the former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, won by a razor-thin margin that, as of 3:25 a.m., was about 35,000 votes. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Baker had secured 48.4 percent of the vote to Coakley’s 46.7 percent.
“No one is more anxious to get started on building a great commonwealth of Massachusetts than I am,” Baker told his supporters around 1:20 a.m. “Tonight the voters said yes.”
The campaign was Baker’s second for the governorship, and analysts said the Republican ran a far stronger race this time around than in 2010, when he lost to Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78. Baker joins a long line of moderate Republican governors in the Bay State, including Mitt Romney and William F. Weld ’66.
With Patrick firmly declaring that he would not seek a third term, the race to replace him stretched out for over a year. Though Coakley took an early lead, the race narrowed over the summer, and after both candidates won their party primaries, Baker gained momentum.
On Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning at Baker’s headquarters at the Seaport Hotel in Boston, the mood shifted from “electric” to “tense” and back to “very optimistic,” attendees said, as Baker’s vote tally rose and fell and, early in the evening, Coakley briefly gained the lead.
But at Coakley’s election night party at the Fairmont Copley Plaza, the crowd went on an emotional roller coaster, with energy swelling as Coakley held a small lead around 10:30 p.m. and taking a somber turn as the Republicans took the U.S. Senate and Coakley’s lead dwindled and disappeared. At around 12:30 a.m., campaign staff told disheartened partygoers to head for home. Coakley, who remained in a hotel suite with advisers and then left for her home in Medford, never made an appearance at her event.
“It’s sad. A lot of people poured their heart and soul into this,” said Coakley campaign volunteer Nicholas Boretti as guests began to file out. “This is kind of a big blow to everyone involved, and you see a lot of people here in tears. Hopefully she does say something and come out.”
Emotions ran high at both events. At the Baker election night party, supporters predicted that a Baker governorship would bring increased transparency and accountability to a state where the legislature is dominated by the Democrats.
“He’d be a lot more fiscally responsible––he is a businessman. Periodically we need people that can develop strategic plans,” said Susan Slonim, a registered independent and Baker donor.
Supporters also said that Baker could work across the aisle to bring “balance to Beacon Hill,” where Democrats currently control both chambers of the state legislature.
Eva Montibello, a Baker supporter, said that she appreciated Baker’s tone on election night.
“He spoke conservatively and respectfully of the attorney general,” Montibello said.
“Going forward, I think the new vision is inspiring. I know he can deliver on the new vision.”
But the road forward will not be easy for Baker.
“He ran a great campaign; he’s run before,” said Lawrence S. DiCara '71, a former Boston city councillor and state political analyst. “He’s going to have to learn how to govern with [Democratic] supermajorities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democratic victories were met with roaring ovations at the Institute of Politics election watch party on Tuesday night, but the smaller Republican crowd had more opportunities to applaud as the GOP regained a majority in the United States Senate after eight years in the minority.
For the first hour and a half after polls closed in Massachusetts, there was only standing room on the ground floor of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, with the steps around the space equally packed with earnest political enthusiasts of both parties.
Posters from the whole range of campaigns, from state representatives to governors and senators, hung on strings above the ground floor and lined the walls around the Forum, with balloons, cupcakes, and even a beer keg at two dollars a cup completing the atmosphere.
Supporters of Republican candidates were confident that a new Senate leadership could bring some change to Congress and the GOP image. Many said they were relieved that the final results aligned with polls in final weeks that had lifted Republican hopes.
“I was a little surprised how much we won by and how early it was called,” said John S. Acton ’17, who worked this summer on Republican Cory S. Gardner’s winning Senate campaign in Colorado.
The IOP called political analysts, including former White House senior aide David Axelrod, throughout the night, and the last holdouts filed out even as many highly anticipated races remained undecided, including the close Senate race in Virginia and the governor’s races in Massachusetts and Maine.
As the last visitors left, Wisconsin’s Republican governor Scott K. Walker was declared victorious in his reelection campaign. There were some final cheers and shaking heads, but even those dismayed by the results said they would stay up to see the final calls.
“It is disappointing that there are so many seats that we thought we could hold onto, but we didn’t,” professed Democrat Jeff B. Schroeder ’15 said, citing Colorado and North Carolina, where incumbent Democrats lost their seats. “One reason 2014 isn’t so sad, though, is that 2008 was such a good year, and I’m confident 2016 will go well.”

Massachusetts voters picked a new governor on Tuesday, but also voted on several ballot measures. Below are the results of the four ballot questions, with summaries based on information provided by the office of Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin. The margins listed are current as of press time.
Question 1: Eliminate Gas Tax Indexing
Question 1, which passed 53 percent to 47 percent, repealed a 2013 law requiring that the state’s gas tax be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation. The gas tax will remain at 24 cents a gallon unless the legislature votes to raise the tax.
Question 2: Expanding the Beverage Container Deposit Law
Question 2 was rejected 73.5 percent to 26.5 percent. The law would have used unclaimed container deposits to set up a Clean Environment Fund. It would also have required deposits on almost all non-alcoholic and non-carbonated drinks, including bottled water, sports drinks, and juices.
Question 3: Expanding Prohibitions on Gaming
Question 3 was defeated by a 60 percent to 40 percent tally. Work on the Springfield and Everett casinos and the Plainville slots parlor will continue as planned, and wagering on the simulcasting of live greyhound races will not be prohibited.
Question 4: Earned Sick Time for Employees 
The measure passed 60 percent to 40 percent. It will allow Massachusetts workers to earn and use up to 40 hours of paid sick time per year if they work at a business with more than 11 employees. Workers will earn one hour of sick time for every thirty hours worked starting on July 1, 2015.
Local Races:
Democratic incumbents representing Cambridge, often unopposed, all held onto their seats. Katherine M. Clark and Michael E. Capuano ran unopposed for Massachusetts' 5th and 7th congressional districts, respectively. Tara E. DeCristoforo won the race for Register of the Probate for Middlesex county, Terrence Kennedy won the race for the Governor’s council, and Marian T. Ryan ran unopposed for District Attorney. Finally, state representatives David Rogers, Marjorie C. Decker, Timothy J. Toomey Jr., Jonathan Hecht, and Jay Livingstone were all re-elected, as were state senators Anthony Petruccelli, Patricia D. Jehlen, and Sal N. DiDomenico.

As Republicans took control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, Harvard political experts said that the new power dynamic in America’s government would not significantly change the existing political climate in Washington.
Prior to the midterm elections, the Republican Party already held control in the House with 233 members, but on Tuesday they clinched the Senate by picking up seven seats from the Democrats in Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, Iowa, Arkansas, West Virginia, and North Carolina. Additionally, the Republican Party enjoyed even greater gains in the House Tuesday, extending their existing majority for the two years that President Obama has left in office.
“It is pretty clear that politics in Washington are broken, and I'm not sure that a Republican-controlled congress, both houses, is going to fix that,” said Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, adding that the already polarized Washington would probably not turn around significant policy changes during the new legislative session.
Other faculty members agreed, saying that President Obama has faced difficulty moving forward with legislature in the past few years with a Republican-controlled House, and that the new, Republican-dominated Senate will only add to this difficulty, particularly on hot-button issues like healthcare and immigration reform.
“Anything Obama has asked for over the last four years since he lost the House, anything he wants whatever it is, the answer is no,” said Jeffrey A. Frankel, a professor at the Kennedy School. “I don't really see how that’s going to change.”
Some posited that, as a result, Obama may try to use his executive power more than before.
“The legislative possibilities of Barack Obama's presidency are effectively over,” McCarthy said. “What Barack Obama has now is the power of the presidency to veto legislation he doesn't agree with or sign executive orders to move certain pieces of the agenda forward at the legislative level.”
Barbara L. Kellerman, a professor at the Kennedy School, agreed that Obama may need to use his veto power in order to defend against Republican legislation.
“Will Obama find it difficult or if not impossible to work with these leaders?” she said.“Will a whole slew of executive decisions occur?”
Despite potential challenges the Obama Administration will encounter, faculty experts said that the midterm results may actually improve public perception of Democrats for the 2016 presidential election.
“It’s probably better for the President politically and the Democrats in 2016 to have the Republican majority,” said Matthew A. Baum, a professor at the Kennedy School. “It gives them a foil because someone else is partly responsible.”
Yet most were quick to reiterate that the bipartisan divide in the government remains stifling.
“It’s not a good outcome tonight,” said Government professor Theda R. Skocpol. “[There] is continued stalemate of the national government in dealing with very important issues with the country.”
In Massachusetts’s only Senate race, Democrat Ed Markey was re-elected by a wide margin. Democrat Katherine Clark was re-elected to the House to represent the state’s Fifth Congressional District, as well, to which part of Cambridge belongs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the first two months of the season in the books, the Harvard men’s soccer team has reached the final stretch of its campaign. And with the team boasting a 9-4-2 record, one would think that the Crimson should be sitting pretty.
Nonetheless, despite holding its best record since 2009—the last time Harvard reached the NCAA Tournament—the Crimson would happily trade away a few wins to go back in time.
At this time last year, Harvard possessed a meager 5-7-2 record. But that Crimson team had one advantage that this year’s does not—control over its own destiny.
Initially an afterthought of the Ivy League following its 1-6-2 start, Harvard climbed to the top of the table by winning four consecutive conference games. Despite its losing record, the Crimson could wrap up the Ancient Eight with wins in its final two games.
One year later, Harvard now faces a different situation. The Crimson is currently tied for third with Penn (6-7-2, 2-1-2 Ivy)—trailing both Princeton (8-3-3, 3-1-1) and Dartmouth (9-4-2, 3-1-1) by two points.
How is this possible? Well, in its second season under Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer, the Crimson has made significant strides in nonconference play, posting a 7-3 record and scoring 2.3 goals per game. But in Ivy play, Harvard has failed to produce the same results, recording just 1.2 goals per game en route to a 2-1-2 record.
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead in the Ancient Eight after grabbing two wins and a tie in its opening three contests, but Harvard could not maintain its advantage on the road against the Tigers and the Big Green.
Against Princeton, despite going up a man in the 37th minute, the Crimson could not handle the Tigers’ offense, conceding the game’s first three goals. Harvard would stage a late comeback attempt, but to no avail, as the Crimson had dug itself too deep a hole to climb out of.
Then in Hanover last weekend, Harvard mustered just a single shot against Dartmouth. Fortunately for the Crimson, however, senior midfielder Kyle Henderson put the team’s lone shot in the back of the net, lifting Harvard to a 1-1 draw.
These kinds of road results have been the norm for the Crimson. Harvard has won just one game away from home this year—a come from behind win over UMass, who currently possesses a 2-14-1 record. Additionally, the Crimson has not beaten Princeton on the road since 2008 and Dartmouth since 2006.
But even so, there is something special about this Harvard team when it shows up to play in Cambridge. Despite its road woes, the Crimson has absolutely dominated its competition at home, going a perfect eight-for-eight on the season. And with the team needing a win this weekend to keep its title hopes alive, Harvard will be right where it thrives—Soldiers Field.
With the conference standings the way they are though, much more than a perfect home record will be on the line for the Crimson when Columbia (6-6-1, 2-2-1) arrives on Senior Night. In fact, it is hardly a stretch to consider the matchup an elimination game.
Even a tie might not be all that beneficial to either side, as Yale and Brown, the conference cellar-dwellers, should hardly pose a problem for the Tigers and the Big Green respectively on the season’s final Saturday. Assuming either Princeton or Dartmouth picks up a win then, it would be impossible for Harvard to be crowned champion if it draws with the Lions.
Furthermore, given the nature of next week’s matchups, if the Crimson hopes to top the table, there will have to be plenty of shakeup this Saturday. Harvard will be rooting for both Cornell (9-5-1, 2-3) and Penn as they take on Dartmouth and Princeton respectively.
If both the Quakers and the Big Red pick up at least a point (in addition to Harvard defeating Columbia), the Crimson will get the matchup it has been dreaming of for an entire year in its season finale—a rematch against Penn with yet another conference championship on the line. But hey, who’s looking that far ahead?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of this column (no peeking), I am going to write something I never expected to see in this paper this season.
I certainly would not have predicted this column before the season started, back when so many fresh feet were tasked with filling such big cleats on defense.
Two games in, injuries to two of the Harvard football team’s most important offensive players made this column even more unlikely.
And during that atrocious 0-0 first half against 0-7 Cornell? I would have laughed you out of Harvard Stadium and across the river for predicting this column would come three short weeks later.
But I suppose that is why I’m in the sportswriting business and not the prophecy business, because here we are. After Saturday’s 23-12 win over Dartmouth (5-2, 3-1 Ivy) I’m ready to say what I never thought I would about this version of the Crimson.
I started thinking it during last week’s 49-7 thumping of Princeton, but that could have been “just one of those days,” as Harvard coach Tim Murphy argued afterwards.
Saturday in Hanover was anything but another perfect scenario, as the Crimson battled gross weather, a Dartmouth side pumped up for its biggest game in nearly two decades, and another injury to starting quarterback Conner Hempel. It still came away with double-digit victory.
Now, Harvard is 7-0 for the first time since Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 led the school on an undefeated 2004 campaign.
To get to 7-0 that year, the Crimson won two one-point games. In 2001, Murphy’s only other unblemished season, Harvard squeaked by Princeton, 28-26, and came back against Brown, 27-20.
There has been no such drama this season.
Harvard has not trailed in a game since September, and its defense has not even allowed anyone to think about a comeback. It’s given up a meager 10.7 points per game, second in the FCS to North Dakota St., the three-time defending national champion that has won its last six games against FBS competition.
Those forsaken cars trying to drive down Mass. Ave at 1:03 p.m. have had more success moving than Harvard’s opponents have against captain Norman Hayes’ crew.
I predicted the Crimson would claim another Ivy title this preseason, but I didn’t think it would do it like this.
“Right now we are playing a really special kind of defense,” Murphy said after Saturday’s game, “The kind of defense we probably haven’t seen since the (9-1 Ivy champion) ‘97 team.”
Murphy does not invoke history often, so your ears should perk up when he does.
The team’s stats should be even gaudier in a fortnight, too. Columbia comes to town this weekend, and it brings with it the 120th best scoring offense in FCS (there are 121 teams). Then Harvard travels to Penn, which currently ranks 97th in scoring offense.
Those two teams are a combined 1-13, with the only win coming when Penn beat Columbia in the Ivy equivalent of that game in your fantasy league between two teams that haven’t checked their lineups since the draft.
Barring the Apocalypse, Harvard will enter The Game 9-0, and the Crimson has not lost that one since Justin Bieber was just some guy making YouTube videos (coincidence?). In fact, Yale has only won once since the Clinton administration. Maybe it’ll have to wait for a successful Hillary 2016 campaign to win again.
It all lines up. I never expected to be seriously considering the odds of a perfect Harvard football season, but with the way the offensive line has mauled opponents and the defense has suffocated them, it would be inappropriate to not consider the chance.
Saturday night, Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens reminded his players that they were still a good squad and that they were still in the title hunt. Murphy has not needed to break out that speech this year. Week in and week out, the Crimson has proven it is the class of the Ivy League.
And they’re not just good. This Harvard team is great.
There, I said it.

November has crept up without a warning, masked by deceivingly warm weather. With the next two months come the end of the fall sports regular season, and teams are now focusing on the post-season tournaments.
While you may have been keeping up with their stats, you may have missed some of Harvard’s athlete’s most entertaining tweets. Here at The Back Page, we have compiled a few tweets that made us chuckle.
Women’s volleyball junior setter Hannah Schmidt celebrates a big win against Yale: “Just swiped Yale’s 36 conference home game streak tonighttt #HVB #shmoney @harvardvball.”
This is definitely a reason to break out the shmoney dance.

Neither were Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. Maybe you’re on to something.
Women’s soccer sophomore forward Midge Purce contemplates the true questions in life: “How do Pokemon understand English?”
It chooses you as a translator, obviously.
------
Winter (season) is coming, and the athletes are more than ready for the season to start. See below for an insight into athletes’ lives off the ice, court, track, etc.
Men’s hockey sophomore forward Tyler Moy has a little bit of confusion: “Just grabbed an entire bowl of mayo thinking it was greek yogurt…kinda rattled it took me 5 bites and a second opinion to realize it”
Do not operate heavy machinery at this point.
Freshman wrestler Austin Gobbo on post-practice conditioning: “Always flex for 10 minutes straight after practice”
The grind never stops. Keep up the good work.
Men’s basketball freshman forward Chris Egi on staying lean and mean: “That yoga session was much needed!!”

Women’s basketball freshman guard/forward Cameron Neiters gives her preferences: “My favorite type of men is ramen”
Wagamamma’s on JFK St. can cater to your needs.
Women’s basketball freshman guard Kirby Porter has Uber problems:
“Uber Driver- ‘What Pandora station do you want?’
Me- ‘Drake’
Driver- ‘How do you spell that D R A K?’”

For over a year now, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker has called junior co-captain Siyani Chambers the best point guard in the Ivy League and one of the best nationwide.
As of Monday, ESPN agrees.
In its College Basketball Player Rankings, ESPN slotted Chambers as the 34th best collegiate hooper in the country, 12 spots ahead of teammate Wesley Saunders. Chambers earned a score of 7.21 points out of a possible 10, placing him directly in front of opponents from perennial basketball powerhouses like Kansas, Arizona, and Oklahoma State.
“We’re very hopeful that he will maintain his identity and maintain his role for our team as a leader [this season],” Amaker said last week. “He is a pacesetter and turns on the jets as well as anyone in our country.”
While Amaker noted Chambers’s speed, ESPN commented on his dependability, deeming him “one of the most reliable point guards in the country.” With the graduation of fellow point guard Brandyn Curry ’14, the Crimson will need to rely even more heavily on Chambers in the backcourt—a fact that will likely force the junior to log significant minutes on a nightly basis.
“We want him on the floor,” Amaker said. “He makes us that much better when we are out there. That’s obvious and he’s proven that and we want him out there as much as we can.”
Chambers has averaged the most minutes of any Harvard player in each of his first two seasons, clocking in 37.8 and 34.3 minutes per game in his freshman and sophomore years, respectively.
“Siyani has been great for us from day one that he got into the program,” co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi said. “We just need him to keep being a leader on the floor and one of the big voices on the team. If he just keeps doing his job, we’ll be fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s soccer program headed to Hanover, N.H. last week in firm control of first place in the Ivy League, needing just a draw to clinch its second straight league title and the Crimson’s fifth in seven years.
Instead, the squad left with a tough 2-0 loss to Dartmouth that snapped the Crimson’s 13 game conference unbeaten streak and brought the Big Green within one point of Harvard in the conference standings.
With only its final regular season game remaining, the Crimson (9-4-2, 4-1-1 Ivy) will have to win the league the hard way. The team still controls its own destiny, as a victory against Columbia (7-3-6, 2-2-2) on Saturday would guarantee a first-place Ivy finish.
A draw or a loss, on the other hand, would leave Harvard’s fate in Dartmouth’s hands, bad news for the Crimson—the Big Green is riding a seven-game conference unbeaten streak of its own and faces off against cellar-dwelling Cornell to close its season.
The match-up with the Lions will be emotional and intense for Harvard, as the Crimson not only will be vying for a championship but will also honor its seven seniors prior to the last home game of their collegiate careers.
“I think it’s exciting that there’s something on the line for senior day,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “That’s the way it usually is in the Ivy League...so this is what we were expecting all along.”
Despite coming off a loss, Harvard can take heart in its historical dominance over Columbia going into Saturday’s contest. The Crimson has a 24-3-1 record all-time against the Lions and has won the last six meetings between the two squads. Harvard also has not lost back-to-back conference games since 2007.
Although Harvard has dominated the Lions in recent years, Columbia has been extremely difficult to beat this season. The Lions have only three losses on the year, and all of them have come by just one goal. Much of this ability to stay in games can be attributed to the team’s stingy defense, which has allowed only 0.56 goals per game on an average of 8.6 shots per contest.
“We’ve gotta be sharper...sharper with [our] passes, sharper with [our] defending,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “[We] need to really focus on that part of the game—sharper possession—because that leads to good attacking opportunities.”
As a result, the Ivy League title likely rests on which version of the Crimson offense shows up on Saturday. Harvard has been feast or famine offensively all year, averaging nearly three goals per game in wins and scoring just once in its other six games combined. With an average of 13.8 shots per game, the Crimson can create scoring opportunities in bunches, but finishing those chances has been the difference between winning and losing for Harvard.
Sophomore forward Midge Purce has drawn most of the defensive attention throughout the season after scoring 11 goals during her rookie campaign. She leads the team again with six goals and has been the Crimson’s chief playmaker but is far from its only option.
Six other Harvard players have scored multiple goals this season, with junior forward Emily Mosbacher second on the team with four tallies. Co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby has also been an integral creator for the Crimson, as she has dished out a team-leading four assists to go along with three goals.
Securing the 2014 Ivy League championship would not only mark back-to-back titles for Harvard, it would also bring the Crimson into a tie with Brown for the most all-time conference titles with 12. The championship would also give Leone his fifth Ivy crown, which would be the most of any coach in program history.
“If you had to say at the beginning of the season, you’re gonna...have one final game to decide [the Ivy League title], anyone would take that shot.” Leone said. “So I’m excited for the opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighty-three years. That’s how long it’s been since the Harvard football team began its season 7-0 and didn’t finish undefeated. That squad lost its final game to Yale, 3-0.
The Crimson (7-0, 4-0 Ivy) has a few more weeks before The Game, but it will attempt to preserve its perfect record when it takes on Columbia (0-7, 0-4) on Saturday at home.
With a 23-12 win over Dartmouth last week, Harvard is now alone atop the Ivy League and in control of its destiny to win the Ancient Eight championship for a second straight year.
Despite the Lions’ dismal record, captain Norman Hayes recognizes the importance of staying motivated given that a league loss would seriously hinder the Crimson’s quest to reclaim the title.
“Our coaches are drilling into our heads, each and every day, that it’s about us now,” Hayes said. “We just have to focus on what we do best and go out and execute each day.”
The Crimson’s offense, banged up early on, returned back to full strength two weeks ago against Princeton, but appears to be plagued once more by injuries. Senior fullback Andrew Casten suffered an injury during the Princeton matchup and didn’t even make the trip to Hanover, while senior quarterback Conner Hempel hurt his shoulder last week against Dartmouth and left the game for the second quarter before coming back early after halftime to close the game.
Casten’s status for Saturday is uncertain, and junior running back Paul Stanton said Wednesday that he’d likely be “taking all the reps.” Hempel is unlikely to play Saturday, according to Murphy.
With Hempel presumably out, junior Scott Hosch will probably be under center for the Crimson, a position familiar to him, as he started four games when Hempel was sidelined with a back injury.
Even without Hempel and Casten, Harvard’s offense shouldn’t have too much of a problem moving the ball against Columbia’s defense, especially with Hosch handing off to Stanton, who has recorded 100-plus yardage rushing games for the last three weeks and has scored in every game he’s appeared in.
The Lions’ defense ranks last in the league, giving up 532 yards of offense a game, something Murphy attributes more to Columbia’s struggling offense.
“I think the thing that’s kind of lost in their struggle of a season has been that despite their offense being ranked second-to-last in all of the FCS, their defense has played well, almost at times miraculously well when you consider the amount of time they spend on the field in conjunction with the lack of overall depth that they have,” Murphy said. “You put it all together, and to hold several really top teams in the Ivy League under 30 points is really impressive.”
Key to the Crimson’s success this season, given the uncertainty at nearly every skill position on offense due to injuries, has been the defense. Harvard has allowed an average of less than 11 points a game, and Lions quarterback Trevor McDonagh will likely be scrambling out of the pocket early and often against a squad that has 18 sacks thus far.
The Crimson secondary came into the year with question marks all around and has answered nearly all of the questions—seven games in, Harvard’s pass defense leads the league.
“We were very inexperienced coming into the season, but we knew how good we could be if we execute, communicate pre-snap and make sure that everyone is on the same page,” Hayes said. “So it’s all about believing in the program, believing in the system and in our schemes and just going out and playing and having fun.”
Against a team that averages points in the single digits, it would be easy for Harvard to underestimate the importance of the game, but in an Ivy League system that doesn’t feature playoffs, every Ancient Eight game holds serious title implications.
“There’s a natural tendency to look ahead, but we just don’t allow it,” Murphy said. “It’s that simple. We need to focus on today, and if there’s a lack of focus, we get it refocused really fast.”

Flyby: What is your worst nightmare?
WO: Spiders. Spiders everywhere. And waking up and realizing that your whole life has gone by. And a blank page staring at you the morning that a large paper is due.
Flyby: What would your ideal fortune cookie read?
WO: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to change, it’s not.” - Dr. Seuss
Flyby: What is one item you can’t live without and one item you could totally live without?
WO: One item that I cannot live without would be a book, whatever it may be (my favorite is To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, but there are a lot of close seconds). One item I could totally live without would be my Gov 20 Course Pack. LOL.
Flyby: If you had an extra life to spare, what is something crazy that you would try?
WO: Travel into space. I think going into space is the coolest thing ever, but I have this paranoia of getting stranded and floating forever with no direction. The movie Gravity made that paranoia even worse.
Flyby: If you were a color, what color would you be? What color would you want to be?
WO: If I was a color, I would be green. And I wouldn’t want to change because green to me represents life and the vitality within it. To me, it means never stop growing and trying to improve and to always be patient. It is a reminder that a tree didn’t grow in a day after all.
Flyby: Why did you run for the UC?
WO: I ran for the UC because I saw it as an opportunity to help make a positive difference, no matter how small. Politics at its best is a discussion and debate within society to improve itself and the lives that are within it. Student government is no different. It gives me a chance to listen to all the amazing individuals here at Harvard and allows me to speak up and fight for what I believe is right.
