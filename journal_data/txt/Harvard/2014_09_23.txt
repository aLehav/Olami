After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the first page of Caitlin Moran’s new novel, “How to Build a Girl,” our narrator, 14-year-old Johanna Morrigan, is caught in the uncomfortable situation of masturbating in the bed she shares with her younger brother. She puts a pillow in between them and calls it their Berlin Wall: “Sexually aware adolescents on one side (West Germany), six-year-old boys on the other (Communist Europe).” From there the book doesn’t for a page cease its hilarity. It is at times, perhaps, too funny for its own good—the jokes so frequent they can seem like a nervous tick. But beyond—and even by means of—the novel’s humor, Moran achieves a high degree of honesty. Unlike so many other novels that feature young female protagonists, this book doesn’t dumb down the adolescent girl experience. It is exciting to see a book that doesn’t follow this mold, one intended to exclude neither teens nor adults from its audience.
The tone of “How to Build a Girl,” which is Moran’s first novel, is very similar to that of her widely acclaimed memoir, “How to Be a Woman.” We meet Johanna when she is 14—but, as in Moran’s memoir, the story is told looking back on these events from a wiser, more grown-up perspective. Fictional Johanna has a lot in common with the real adolescent Caitlin described in “How to Be a Woman”: both grew up in council houses (a type of public housing in the UK) in Wolverhampton with large families, and both began working as music journalists in their teen years. Their personalities too are similar—they grow from boundlessly optimistic children into more cynical and anxiety-ridden yet ambitious teenagers. It is clear that Moran sticks to what she knows, and this is to the novel’s credit, as the narrative’s profundity is founded in its sincerity.
The novel’s greatest departure from the memoir is that it lacks direct analysis, which Moran frequently includes in her first book. However, this makes “How to Build a Girl” all the more powerful. Not only does Moran have more time to focus on details, but, simply put, she diligently follows the oft-given advice to show and not to tell. And what she shows us is that the adolescent experience, so often segregated in storytelling from the rest of the human experience, is a greatly complex and deeply human one. Few books with teenage protagonists, and even fewer books actually aimed at adults, depict adolescence in all its complexity. Female protagonists in particular tend to be middle or upper class (unless their poverty is the premise) and thin (unless their weight is the premise). And they face a very limited set of problems—never more than two or three at a time, and usually boy-related.
What Moran does with her novel is to showcase the reality behind all the stereotypical teenage fears and desires. They are fueled by much deeper, more universal human feelings: from the most primitive, such as sex drive, to the most advanced, such as a physical disconnect during sex due to the lack of a female narrative in mainstream society. And she doesn’t limit her protagonist to a certain level of complexity: Johanna is both intelligent and obsessed with being kissed. “My kissing is going to change everything,” she says. “I’m going to be the Beatles of kissing.” She is a fan-girl as well as a writer (of poetry, music reviews, an attempted novel), and a lover of “The Chronicles of Narnia” alongside George Orwell. The novel does a service to the young adult genre, as it is far franker and more realistic in dealing with teenagers and their problems than are many of that ilk.
However, the novel is not without its flaws; most notably, the plot and characters are sometimes difficult to believe. After investing two years in recreating herself as “Dolly Wilde,” 16-year-old Johanna scores a job as a music journalist. It’s hard to declaim this plot point as unrealistic when Moran herself accomplished the same feat in real life. But compared to the picture we get of young Caitlin’s work at “Melody Maker” in “How to Be a Woman,” Johanna’s (or Dolly’s) work at “D&ME” seems to be multiplied by a glamor factor of three or four. When Johanna is wowing her adult coworkers with her daring and getting invited to parties with famous musicians, the book seems to stray from its well of truth and begins to resemble a more mundane work of young adult fiction.
At times the book also threatens to devolve into a Caitlin Moran standup routine—the hilarity is so never-ending it borders on relentless and may tire some readers. Even when desperately sad, Johanna is funny. In a “fury of self-flagellation,” in which Johanna tries cutting herself, she compares her thigh to a piece of pork and references her “skills learned in the ‘Meat’ section of Dorothy Hartley’s ‘Food in England,” which she then quotes. This is the respect in which the book most departs from similarly honest but more serious young adult books, like those pioneered by Judy Blume. While this makes the book a particular joy to read, it does so in exchange for making Johanna a less vulnerable and relatable character than she could otherwise be.
Yet it feels unfair to fault the novel too harshly for its mirthfulness. After all, it is clearly in Johanna’s nature—and perhaps in Moran’s, too—to use humor to cope with sadness. It is through the specific style it utilizes in relating the experience of one girl that the book succeeds. “How to Build a Girl” is not the be-all and end-all of adolescent girl narratives, but it would be impossible for any one novel to merit that title. If “How to Build a Girl” begins a trend in the young adult genre of books that depict women from a diverse range of perspectives, the genre will be much better for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I speak for I think many people in the audience when I say, ‘Yes, we’re back to the lesbians,’” began author Emily M. Danforth during her conversation with fellow queer author Sarah Waters at the Brattle Theatre on September 18. Waters, who has to date written six highly lauded historical novels—five of which feature lesbians as protagonists—participated in the Harvard Book Store-sponsored event as part of her tour promoting her newest book, “The Paying Guests,” which was published on September 16. Unlike her previous novel, “The Little Stranger,” “The Paying Guests” centers on a lesbian romance—a development that pleased the overwhelmingly female audience at the event, judging by the whoops and cheers that followed Danforth’s quip.
Waters’s lesbian-centric fiction is arguably unique in the accolades it has garnered: she has been shortlisted for the Man Booker prize twice and the Orange Prize for Fiction once. To a casual reader, then, Waters can seem the sole writer in her genre. She sees the situation quite differently, however: at the time she began writing, she says, various small presses were publishing substantial volumes of lesbian and gay fiction. “It seemed like a really exciting time for lesbian and gay writing,” she says. “And not all of it was fantastically ambitious. But it was exciting that it was there at all…. I felt part of a community of readers. And I think knowing that there was that community of readers enabled me as a writer.”
Waters transitioned into writing from academia: she holds a Ph.D. from Queen Mary University of London that she earned for a thesis on lesbian and gay historical fiction, particularly focused on the Victorian era. It is no surprise, then, that her first three novels are set in Victorian England. “It was in writing my thesis that I had the ideas for my first novel because I’d been looking at late Victorian gay life and also looking at contemporary lesbian and gay historical fiction,” Waters says. For her fourth and fifth novel she moved to the 1940s, a period that was at the time comparatively new for her.
“The Paying Guests,” however, is set in the 1920s. “When I was writing about the ’40s, I was very conscious that [the ’20s] was where my characters had sort of come from, but I knew very little about it,” Waters says. “It was in doing research on the period that the novel emerged for me.” During her talk, Waters provided insight into what this research process looked like. She described how she began researching the period by reading authors such as Woolf and Huxley but was left unsatisfied. “As wonderful as their fiction is, I couldn’t identify with it at all. It just gave me no purchase on the ’20s,” Waters said. “And I realized it was because those novels are about high society people…and I realized I wanted to write a novel about ordinary, suburban people.” Waters instead began to consult records of criminal trials in lieu of novels. “If you look at the transcripts from these trials, they give you this very immediate access into these people’s lives,” she said.
For Waters, however, the research process is not necessarily straightforward; there is naturally a dearth of historical records from the ’20s detailing lesbian relationships. Though Waters does think of her writing as to a certain extent uncovering hidden lesbian stories of the past, at the same time she recognizes that her novels often do, to some degree, change the past. “[I think about] taking on the stereotypes we have about the past or the myths we have about the past and sort of queering them, sort of putting lesbian in them, to…make them accommodate lesbian stories,” she says. During the event, Waters commented on one description of her novels that she liked in particular. “There was a review recently that I loved…talking about the books as being like a queer retro-fitting on a car,” she said. “And I really liked that idea…like I’m taking the chassis of an old car and shoving in a queer engine.”
“It’d have to be a hybrid,” quipped Danforth in response.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James the Printer, a Nipmuc Native American who attended the Indian College at Harvard, got his English name from his mastery of the printing press. As a student at the Indian College, established in 1655 for the purpose of educating Native Americans, James laid the type of the Eliot Bible on the first printing press in America, which was located at Harvard. The Eliot Bible was the first version of the English Bible translated into a Native American language in the British colonies.
During a 1979 excavation of Harvard Yard, archaeologists found the printing press letters James the Printer used to create the Bible. The printing type, which could have been used as early as 1663 to print the first edition of the book, now lives in Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology surrounded by other objects that have been unearthed in Harvard Yard.
Objects like these are used by historians and archaeologists alike to try and synthesize a more vivid picture of the past. At Harvard as well as in Boston, the primary reward of archaeological excavations seems to be providing students and volunteers with a historical perspective that written records alone cannot always provide, as well as a powerful, tangible means of forging a connection with the past.
HARVARD EXPOSED
It is an understatement to say that Harvard is rich in history. The University boasts nearly four centuries of students, as well as a vast collection of artifacts and documents they have produced. The Peabody, one of over a dozen museums operated by the University, houses more than 1.2 million objects, ranging from copper buttons worn by Harvard students of yore to intricately woven Paracas textiles. But while the University has accumulated a wealth of knowledge and artifacts, much of the history of the institution itself has been lost to time—for every copper button housed at the Peabody, there are countless others that have not been preserved.
That has begun to change in recent decades, as previously lost artifacts have been unearthed from beneath our feet during excavations of Harvard Yard. Off and on for over 30 years, students and faculty members have been digging in the Yard in search of artifacts traceable to both the College and the Indian College, which was closed and torn down in 1693 due to insufficient enrollment.
The history of student excavations in Harvard Yard began with John D. Stubbs ’80, who opened a dig site in front of Matthews Hall in 1979. It was this dig that brought about the discovery of the printing type used by James the Printer. Excavation work continued in 2005 when Harvard celebrated the 300th anniversary of the building of the Indian College by creating the Harvard Yard Archaeology Project.
The project ultimately took the form of an undergraduate course in the Anthropology Department, “Archaeology of Harvard Yard,” which gives students a first-hand experience in archaeological work using the University’s historic center as an excavation site. “This class focuses on 17th-century Harvard, and in particular the legacy of the Harvard Indian College,” says Patricia Capone, a curator at the Peabody and the current professor of the course. “We are hoping to identify the architectural remains of the Indian College, as well as some of the artifacts of daily life.”
Since its inception in 2005, the course has been offered four more times, with its most recent iteration happening this fall. Tia M. Ray ’12, a proctor in Pennypacker Hall, took the class in 2009. This was an important year for the program—it was in 2009 that the class discovered the first architectural remains of the Indian College. “We were thinking about the way that the archaeology would benefit our knowledge of colonial Harvard, but also what it meant for local tribal communities, specifically focusing on the Nipmuc and Aquinnah Wampanoag communities,” Ray says.
Capone believes that the objects found during these excavations have illuminated students’ understanding of life at Harvard in the 17th century. “It has been interesting so far to note that there isn’t necessarily much difference in the remains of daily life between the Indian College and the other 17th-century buildings at Harvard,” Capone says.
One similarity revealed by the excavations is that enrollees at both colleges were willing to break Harvard’s then-puritanical rules about alcohol and tobacco. During the Harvard Yard digs, students have found a plethora of tobacco pipes and broken wine bottles. The 2009 class used the illicit objects to develop an exhibit that explored their implications for the students’ relationship to rules. According to the exhibit, the European ceramic pipes and the American red clay pipes both speak to the considerable time and resources that students invested in smoking tobacco. Shards of glass from bottles of wine and broken pieces of ceramic ale bottles indicate that students also flouted the University’s strict rules regarding alcohol—a story not often included in accounts of the College’s history.
Capone believes that these findings represent the beginning of a process of discovery that will go a long way toward illuminating the history of the Indian College. “We can now put the Indian College on the map,” she says, “and from there begin to better understand what we’re finding inside the building [and] what we’re finding outside the building, [and] compare its robusticity to other buildings of the time.”
THE REST IS HISTORY
The archaeological footprint of the Indian College and the remnants of students’ debauchery both show how archaeology can offer an alternative story to that provided by historical records. Jill Lepore, a professor of American history, is not an archaeologist but has used the findings of archaeologists to complement information gleaned from historical records.
In Lepore’s opinion, historical records offer only a narrow perspective of the past. “Most of what is interesting in chronicling the lives of ordinary people is not kept,” Lepore says. “Most archives and museums, mostly public places, but sometimes private places, where we keep the chronicle of our lives, [tend] to commemorate and preserve the lives of people who have notable achievements.”
According to Lepore, what was selected for preservation was determined by those with the ability to choose, whether through their positions of power or through their literacy. While such documents provide useful information about the past, they fail to provide a complete picture of the epochs they represent. “Social history is interested in recovering ordinary people’s lives by looking at things they kept for different reasons, like censuses or tax lists or the records of the overseers of the poor in Boston. Those things were kept for purely administrative reasons,” Lepore says.
For Lepore, archaeology’s usefulness lies in its ability to convey information about past lives—the kind of intimate details that written documents often fail to communicate. “To the extent that I, as a historian, use archaeological evidence, it’s often things that could tell us about the lives of people that have been preserved in almost no other way,” Lepore says.
By excavating and discovering lost objects, the modern excavator provides a corollary to written records. Frequently, archaeological discoveries complement the prevailing historiography; sometimes, however, information gleaned from newly unearthed artifacts can pose a challenge to entrenched historical narratives.
“Archaeology, especially in the 19th century, which is when it was founded, felt like the unappreciated younger sister of history,” Harvard History Department Chair Daniel L. Smail says. “The people who wrote history in the 19th century thought that the people who wrote history knew the past, and archaeologists really resented it.”
Smail’s remarks help to explain why, for a long time, archaeology was conceived of as a “handmaiden to history.” This somewhat pejorative nickname, coined by early 20th-century archaeologist Ivor Noel Hume, spoke to the notion that archaeology does not provide any new information, but merely shores up what is already known.
This is a notion flatly opposed by Capone. “Archaeology can offer insights that aren’t necessarily apparent through studying documentary information,” she says. “Archaeology is not conducted solely to verify the historical record but may be informed by it.”
A TOUCHING TALE
Despite the advent of modern technology and the ability to have visual information at the click of a button, physical objects still have a great appeal to historians and non-historians alike. The value of the artifacts found in Harvard Yard seems to derive less from objective historical significance than from the feelings they are able to evoke in those who unearth them.
“A physical connection to the past is such a powerful thing,” Capone says, and archaeology and the objects that it unveils can serve as that connection. “Archaeology is an example of an individual physical connection to the past, and hopefully one that we can then share through museum interpretation.”
Historians have long marveled at the power of physically touching objects of the past. It creates a feeling of continuity between the past and the present. “One of the features of archaeological materials in particular is this some sense of immediate contact,” Smail says.
Psychologists have created a name for this sensation.The law of contagion states that a magical connection exists between a person and the object that he has touched. Smail believes that people are attracted to archaeological findings and other historical artifacts because of the connection it allows them to feel between the past and the present.
“When I take my students to handle a medieval object or a 19th-century object from a slave cemetery, it it a completely different experience than reading about it in a book,” Smail says. “The touching of it transmits something into the object.”
This feeling of connection between the past and the present attracts many. However, looking at an archaeological finding from the vantage point of the present also changes the context and meaning of the object. “An object is not only what you are seeing there but also its entire history. So objects carry more meaning that what you might ordinarily assign to them, not only what it has produced but also the memories objects carry,” Ray says. “Objects mean different things in different spaces.”
DIGGING BOSTON
Of course, Harvard is not the only place in the area that is steeped in history. The city of Boston, officially established six years before Harvard, boasts an illustrious historical legacy that the City of Boston Archaeology Program, founded in 1983, is doing its best to protect.
Joe Bagley is leading this fight as the official City Archaeologist. In addition to serving as curator for the archaeological collections at the City Archaeology Lab, Bagley is response for ensuring that modern construction projects do not get in the way of the continuance of Boston archaeology. “I’m more on the reactionary side of things, so my role in the city is to review how potential projects or construction, development, or modification to building or landscapes can impact the archaeological sites,” Bagley says.
The City of Boston Archaeology Program is not currently working at any dig sites, but they are sorting through about 40,000 objects that they uncovered at a recent site, the Clough House in Boston’s North End.
Built in 1715, the Clough House is currently owned by the Old North Church. In 2013, the church decided to build a new walkway in the old house’s backyard. City code required that the land be examined by archaeologists before construction could begin. During the examination, Bagley and his team unearthed an abundance of artifacts from throughout the house’s history. In the 1700s, the Clough House was only ever inhabited by a single family at a time. That changed in 1808, when the house was converted to a tenement and many immigrant families from Ireland occupied it for roughly the next hundred years.
“We are using these 40,000 artifacts to compare how the people in the house lived and how life changed in that house between when it was lived in by five people who were relatively wealthy in the 18th century and then later on in the 19th century when it was lived in by 25 people at the same time,” Bagley says.
In all of this work, Bagley, the only paid member of the City of Boston Archaeology Project, relies on community volunteers interested in history and archaeology. Only about a third of them have previous archaeological experience, but Bagley does not view this as an obstacle. “Having volunteers on the site slows things down in a good way and allows us to do some really good work,” he says. “I find that as long as I have people with me that have done [archaeology] before that can help if there are a lot of [inexperienced volunteers] on the site, that volunteers that have never done archaeology before are the most careful and concerned,” Bagley says. “They are the first people to stop if they think that something is going wrong.”
Bagley is not the only one who benefits from having volunteers on site; he has seen how the volunteers themselves gain new experiences and encounter objects that connect them more closely to the history of their communities. “They are making a discovery that predates themselves, that predates their family, or that predates their community,” Bagley says. “But it is their history because they found it.”
LIFE AFTER DEPTHS
Archaeological digs like the ones led by Bagley in Boston and the one in Harvard Yard produce thousands of artifacts that help those involved to develop a more complete understanding of history—an understanding that can then be shared with the public. This is the aim of Anthropology 1131, the complementary course to Anthropology 1130, which focuses on how to present the students’ findings in the Peabody’s exhibit “Digging Veritas.”
Because of the lack of display space, Bagley uses Facebook and Twitter to display as many of his findings as possible and provide visitors to the websites with an instantaneous connection to current archaeology. “We don’t have to convince people in Boston and Cambridge that history matters; we just have to show them that it’s not something that you see on TV, but you can find it outside and it’s going on right now,” Bagley says.
Ultimately, though, most objects discovered during archaeological excavations will never be displayed publically. Around 80 percent of the Boston City Archaeology Lab is devoted to storing the uncovered items, and Harvard’s own collections extend far beyond what is displayed.
After being excavated and analyzed to the fullest extent, many artifacts are fated to sit in storage until a researcher decides that they can be used to gain new information about history. “One thing that people are always surprised about regarding archaeology is just how not exciting everything that comes out of the ground is. You may have found 40,000 artifacts, and six are worthy of ever showing anybody. The story is the important part. Most artifacts aren’t that interesting to look at as things,” Bagley says.
Still, these artifacts that will probably never be displayed play an important role in figuring out the story of the past. “It’s really just piecing it all back together and trying to squeeze out as much of the story as you can,” Bagley says.
Archaeological discoveries inevitably offer a new perspective on the lives of the people of the past. Sometimes the artifacts confirm the historical narrative as we know it; sometimes they negate it. Most of the time, these objects illuminate a new facet of history and opens the doors for further exploration.
“[History and archaeology] together give us a binocular or stereoscopic view. And when you put the two together you see things you could not see through just one lens alone,” Smail says. “And they tell us different things, but it is like black and white and when you put them together you get color.” Smail’s sentiment illustrates the enthusiasm archaeology inspires in those who have experienced its particular thrill—that of literally touching history.

Imagine yourself strolling through an idyllic Victorian garden in West Sussex. As you walk through the footpaths, basking in the warm sun, the fall breeze, the stately oaks, you may think to yourself, “I wish every garden were like this.” But landscape architect Martin Rein-Cano has other ideas.
“The influence of [the English Garden] has been very, very important,” Rein-Cano said in a lecture delivered Sep. 16 at the Graduate School of Design. “And for that I must say I hate it. Because it’s like we’ve been copying a certain style for 300 years.”
Rein-Cano’s distaste for the well-trodden path echoes throughout his work and was evident in the very structure of his sprawling, eclectic lecture. Though nominally focused on landscape architecture and public spaces, Rein-Cano managed to address everything from the nature of sports (“regulated war,” he called it, gesticulating intensely) to the link between language and physiognomy (“the French make these farting sounds in their speech, and that’s what gives them the characteristic French lips”). Somehow, though, it all came together under the umbrella of landscape architecture—its philosophy, power, and effect on communities.
Rein-Cano began his lecture by emphasizing how the flaws of any entity, be it a space, a person, or a structure, give it its essential character. “[Acceptance of] the inability to be perfect and the fight to be what you want to be is what makes us different from each other,” Rein-Cano said. “Many times, solving problems, we also dissolve the idea of the character of a space.”
After expanding on his design philosophy, Rein-Cano told a few funny anecdotes about his encounters with other, non-landscape architects, which got some laughs from his primarily-GSD audience.
“We [landscape architects] all know we have to be at least as narcissistic as [building] architects to be taken seriously. So, when it comes to discussions with [building] architects, I always have this game asking them who was actually the first architect ever…they usually say Michelangelo…and I say, ‘Well, there’s nothing older than that?’ They get really angry and they ask, ‘What are you talking about?’ I say: ‘Look, paradise, be careful—he up there is one of us!’”
Rein-Cano rejected the idea of the park as a static, unchanging tableau, instead focusing on the potential dynamism of the space. As footage and music from the films “Rocky” and “Easy Rider” played in the background, Rein-Cano discussed the idea of the garden as a predecessor of the film. “Instead of the movie running in front of you, you walk through this movie from one scene, one picture to the other,” Rein-Cano said. “And this movie’s really 3D.”
The second half of Rein-Cano’s lecture focused on Superkilen, a park project undertaken by his firm Topotek1. A park built in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen, Superkilen consists of three distinct sections—a red “market” earmarked for shopping, a green park for sports, and a black “square” designed to serve as an “urban living room.” The park, built in a poor, immigrant-heavy area of Copenhagen, is now the 10th most visited site in Denmark.
Rein-Cano also noted the importance of input from the impoverished occupants of the area into the design of Superkilen. “The idea of integration of the people, the will of the people into the project was one of the important elements of the project.” Much to the amusement of the audience, Rein-Cano recounted how he badgered the residents of the area for personal artifacts to include in the park, even going so far as to fly a resident to Turkey to retrieve a particularly evocative dentist’s signboard featuring a “crescent and tooth” emblem. Extreme, yes. But Rein-Cano’s lecture was imbued with the idea of going to great lengths to achieve a vision, even if that vision strays from tradition.

Another season, another film adaptation of a best-selling dystopian young adult novel that is not “The Hunger Games.” In Wes Ball’s “The Maze Runner,” based on the novel by James Dashner, distinction lies in believable humanity, in characters with well-meant intentions that align themselves with motivations deeper than a reductive binary. Here, it seems, a group of young people trapped in a designed and hostile environment (not “The Hunger Games”) finally understands that their chances of survival are higher if they attempt to work together more and kill each other less.
The premise manifests interestingly but recognizably: doe-eyed teenager Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) wakes up in an elevator that spits him out into a grassy clearing where he is quickly roughed up and acclimatized by the boys who arrived before him. He remembers nothing but his name, but group leader Alby (Aml Ameen) assures him that this is normal. Alby, portrayed by Ameen with a reassuring, quiet poise rather than bravado, also explains that the clearing is bordered by a circular maze that remains open to the boys during the day, but mechanically closes at night. This, Thomas learns, protects the boys from the maze-dwelling Grievers, giant robot spiders with faces that make Alien look downright cuddly. Some of the boys, officially titled “runners,” explore the maze every day, but an exit has not yet been found. Thomas, of course, immediately tries to enter said lethal maze.
Alby stops him and explains that peace amongst the boys is reliant on the group’s stability and maintenance of numbers, in one of the moments of welcome rationality that holds the film back from the edge of routine allegory. Similarly, the dynamic amongst the young, almost all-male cast is refreshingly endearing rather than immediately divided, even as Gally (Will Poulter, in an impressively nuanced performance) takes offense to Thomas’s upstart tendencies. They drink homemade brew and clap each other on the back often. They wear cargo shorts and leather-corded necklaces. They discuss group morale and social events in a dark, musty room. They’re like a fraternity, only quite racially diverse. You half-expect someone to start a game of ultimate frisbee or insist that they’re reinventing EDM with their GarageBand projects.
Individually, though, some performances falter: after her arrival (which upheaves the tenuous order of the all-male group and finally illuminates some clues about the creators of the maze), the heavily-billed Kaya Scodelario of “Skins” fame probably has about 10 minutes of total screen time as Teresa, responsible mainly for saying single words and shedding single tears. O’Brien, meanwhile, lends Thomas little in the way of sympathy, even in moments of grief or terror. The majority of his screen time is dedicated to gaping, head-clutching, wordless screaming, as well as, surprise, running.
However, that very physicality also contributes compellingly to an overall effect of heady breathlessness. The strain is visible on the faces and bodies of actors as they sprint away from Grievers, each other, or through the shifting, bladed walls of the maze; the camera skillfully follows them without attempts to deceive about their actual speed. Shots of the maze itself artfully demonstrate its complexity and dulled-metal claustrophobia, mostly shying away from revealing the maze in its entirety.
There are still some pitfalls throughout “The Maze Runner” that by now are almost canon of the genre: the supposedly amnesiac boys somehow know how electronic trackers and syringes work and can accurately intuit meaning from assortments of letters and numbers they discover in their explorations. There are cryptic video messages from mysterious authority figures. There is bogglingly brazen setup for sequels. There are even flashback dream sequences.
But on the whole, “The Maze Runner” is an intriguing version of a narrative that permeates the contemporary box office, one that doesn’t have to sacrifice an imagination of a cooperative community for the sake of sensationalist, individual heroism. When the maze’s full scope is revealed towards the end of the film, the visual effect is quite stunning: it’s really only in the close-ups that the cracks in the walls are visible.

The late historian and professor Tony R. Judt once told Historically Speaking that our task “is to tell what is almost always an uncomfortable story and explain why the discomfort is part of the truth we need to live well and live properly.”
While Tony Judt certainly was not talking about college life, his message seems to extend to us here at Harvard.
Just listen to the newly minted Dean of the College, Rakesh Khurana, speak about the college experience he hopes each student will get at Harvard. You will hear him talk about “transformation,” and his idea of a “transformative” college experience is deeply rooted in embracing discomfort. Real growth, to Dean Khurana, stems from branching out and exploring this sort of uncomfortable new territory.
Discomfort at Harvard comes in many different forms. But the main source of my own has come from class, privilege, and wealth.
It’s no secret that a good chunk of the Harvard population is unusually wealthy. In fact, according to Walter Benn Michaels, author of the polemic “The Trouble with Diversity: How We Learned to Love Identity and Ignore Inequality,” roughly 75 percent of Harvard students’ families have incomes over $100,000 per year, while only 20 percent of American families have incomes that high.
But what’s more troubling than these statistics alone is the fact that, once the most wealthy and privileged come to Harvard, they tend to stick together.
Here’s an example: When I first arrived at Harvard, I ran into someone from back home in New York City. She invited me to dinner with “a few other kids from New York.” Hers was an innocent display of kindness, and yet she was precipitating an insidious phenomenon—the rapid formation of the New York City “clique.”
So why do the New York City (and LA, and Greenwich, and so on) “elite” coalesce into these groups? This is where discomfort comes into the picture.
Yes, people do tend to find friends who have similar backgrounds and beliefs. That’s the easy answer. But in my experience, when it comes to the particularly privileged, there’s something more at play.
Unlike our different cultural or religious backgrounds, privilege is not a source of pride or a difference from our classmates that we choose to celebrate. Instead, privilege—and more importantly what privilege says about each of our characters—makes us uncomfortable. Our privilege forces us to question our worthiness and our merit, two of the things most highly valued at an institution like this one.
I find myself asking: If I got here because of the advantages afforded me by my background (a fact that is almost irrefutably true), then what does that say about my worthiness? What about my classmates who have made it here without any of the opportunities that I had? How do I reconcile my own desire to succeed with the guilt that I can’t help but feel about having had a leg up in the first place? What am I, or where would I be, without my privilege?
These questions are tough to ask and even harder to answer. The natural reaction to these questions, questions that inspire self-doubt, is to insulate ourselves from ever having to confront what it is that makes us so uneasy.
It is possible to avoid them altogether: by surrounding ourselves with friends who grew up the same way. We can avoid situations that bring these questions to the surface and then go about our college lives in bubbles of comfort.
But while avoidance is certainly possible, it’s far from right. If we experience college with social blinders on, we miss out.
In the words of Harvard’s mission statement, “Education at Harvard should liberate students to explore, to create, [and] to challenge.” It’s the last word that matters most. Forcing ourselves to challenge our beliefs, our upbringing, and the way of life that we may have experienced for our first 18 years is undeniably difficult. But it’s also essential to what Harvard seeks to accomplish with each of its students: a broader understanding of the world, and personal growth.
Failure to confront discomfort now leads to an equal inability to confront it later. If our awareness of our classmates of different socioeconomic backgrounds exists purely in the realm of abstraction, then we have failed not only to undergo Khurana’s “transformative” college experience, but we have also failed in making ourselves socially responsible citizens.

With a 5.9 percent admissions rate, getting into Harvard is a roll of the dice. There are thousands of qualified students around the country who could get in, but don’t. As students here, we have a rare opportunity filled with incredible experiences —experiences enhanced by the diversity of our peers.
Deciding who gets into Harvard is obviously difficult. How should the admissions committee control for significant differences in life circumstances?
The Harvard College admissions office reports that “daughters and sons of Harvard College alumni/ae may receive an additional look” in the admissions process. What does this “additional look” grant them? According to researcher Michael Hurwitz, legacy status—that is, applying as the child of an alumnus—gives applicants a significantly better chance of acceptance. At top elite American colleges, legacy applicants are, on average, three times more likely to get accepted than non-legacies—even after controlling for characteristics like wealth and race.
According to the Class of 2018 survey, 16 percent of freshmen who answered the survey are considered legacy students—at least one of their parents attended Harvard. A further 37.3 percent of freshmen legacy students come from families with incomes of $500,000 or more. Students who occupy this income bracket are also more likely to have employed private college counseling than those from lower-income backgrounds. Surveys are imperfect, but we believe that these data tell a larger story.
These facts suggest that legacy students often have access to more resources than non-legacy students. We aren’t suggesting that legacy students aren’t qualified—they obviously are. We simply question the fairness of preferential treatment for legacy applicants in the admissions process, purely on the basis of their parents’ alumni status.
We want to better understand Harvard’s admissions process. As it currently stands, the admissions office lacks transparency in their explanation of potentially significant factors such as legacy status. When legacy students have likely received support and access to resources in the college application process, why should the admissions office privilege them further? We don’t have a satisfactory answer.
It’s impossible to simultaneously give preference to a generally privileged group of students and trumpet a commitment to diversity. Harvard claims to broaden students’ world views by exposing them to each others’ experiences. This is part of its “transformative” liberal arts education. By perpetuating a legacy of unequal access, Harvard is not living up to its commitment to its students.
We want to ensure that all qualified students have a fair chance to gain admission regardless of where their parents did or did not go to college. We recognize that a Harvard without legacy preference is not a Harvard without legacy students. Legacy students are often qualified—and privileged.
With these ideas in mind, we want the College to eliminate legacy preference in admissions, to make the admissions process more transparent, to release concrete data about the socioeconomic distribution of the student body, and to actively strive toward a legacy of equal access for its many qualified applicants.
This is not an unreasonable request: Peer institutions like MIT are openly against using legacy preference in admissions decisions. It’s possible to remain elite without relying on generational preferences.
As one of America’s esteemed universities, Harvard has a responsibility to ensure representation and inclusion of America’s extraordinary diversity. America’s oldest university must be accessible.
We are excited to introduce the Harvard Legacy Project, an opportunity to speak openly about these issues. After our op-ed last spring, our movement has grown. We’ve received wide support from students and alumni who care about equal access. We believe that stellar applicants—regardless of their backgrounds—should have equal access to the amazing opportunities that Harvard has to offer.
We invite you to join us in our conversations about the importance of diversity—in all of its forms.

CS50 has become the most popular course at Harvard, with 818 undergraduates enrolled this semester, and is taught in a style unlike that of any other class at Harvard. Each lecture is a performance, and students are treated to weekly lunches, special events, and a plethora of free items from various corporate sponsors. CS50 also holds a special place in the Administration’s rules: it is the only class that students are allowed to take at the same time as another class and watch the videotaped lectures instead of attending class.
Basic coding is a very important skill, and we support the CS50 staff’s efforts to appeal to a broad range of students and make them excited about computer science. In particular, Professor David J. Malan ’99 and his team do a remarkable job of ensuring that students who have no prior experience in computer science still feel comfortable registering for the class, despite its famed difficulty and requirement of long hours. The course’s popularity is very much deserved.
We do however feel that there should be more transparency regarding the course’s unique privileges. The administration should explain more clearly why it believes that CS50 is the online course for which videotaped lectures are an appropriate substitute for physically going to class. We especially believe that Harvard should address the issue of CS50 apparently having different rules about cheating than does any other class in the College. CS50’s policy of giving amnesty to students who admit to cheating within a short time period may have many merits, and it may be worthwhile to test that policy in one class, but consistency in academic integrity policies across the entire College should always be the goal. In order to maintain a standard set of regulations for each course the administration should delineate what exactly makes CS50 unique, and how other professors who want their classes to have this exception as well can structure their courses.
CS50 also should make public more information about its corporate funding. While we do not necessarily take issue with its seeking additional funding to create a more enjoyable experience for its students, we think that it should be clear to its students about the natures of the companies that are sponsoring events. We do not see corporate sponsorship dramatically altering the content of the course. However, CS50 is heavily based on problem sets—and problems may be seen as reflective of the nature of issues students might encounter on the job. It’s important that the teaching staff remember to give a wide variety of questions, and not simply structure them to appeal to their corporate sponsorship.
We are happy to see that CS50 has been successful in making a very important skill accessible to large numbers of students. So long as the course’s innovative methods are practiced with transparency, we laud their role in expanding students’ horizons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a universally accepted truism that young people tend to be liberal, and the generations above them conservative.
Divest from fossil fuels, boycott Doubletree, open Hillel, occupy Harvard. We’re certainly emblematic of the stereotype, and polls everywhere reaffirm what we already suspect. Gen Y and Millennials like liberal things—like gay marriage, legal weed, and the welfare net—while the middle-aged and the elderly dislike all of them.
A related truism is that we move to the right with age—that is, upon coming to terms with our own limitations, we shed our idealism and accept a toned down, conservative view of the world. And again there’s some truth to this: the Baby Boomers—the generation of Woodstock and the tumultuous ‘60s—poll like staunch Republicans today.
But both these rules, despite seeming universal, have exceptions, both at home and abroad, and these exceptions have an outsized potential to radically reshape the way America interacts with the world. This connection may seem obscure and tenuous, but stay with me for a moment.
Among the rare places where young people are in fact more conservative than their elders is America’s staunch, if occasionally manipulative ally in the Middle East, Israel. Two-thirds of first-time voters there described themselves as “right-wing” during the 2013 national elections, and 58 percent of Israelis under age 35 described their political orientation as “right”—a number far higher than any other age group.
Over 40 percent of voters aged 18 to 24 went for hawkish parties—like Likud and the annexationist Jewish Home in 2013—compared to only 10 percent that went for left-leaning banners like Labor. And according to a separate survey conducted by the Jerusalem Post, only 42 percent of young Israelis still desire a two-state solution—way less than the portions that do among older generations.
The reasons for this conservatism are twofold: Jews from the rightist Orthodox community reproduce much more quickly than their liberal counterparts, and the demographics of Israel are showing it. Plus, many young Israelis have been reared in an atmosphere, post-Oslo Accords, of unending violence and distrust—think the Second Intifada, the erection of the West Bank security barrier, the wars in Gaza, in 2009 and 2014.
But whatever the reasons, the next generation of Israelis is set to stiffen an already hawkish line on Palestine, one in which deep empathy—already a rare commodity, if this summer was any indication—is even rarer.
This hardening of attitudes might not be significant in and of itself, if it weren’t for the fact that attitudes among young Americans, and even among young American non-Orthodox Jews, are continually shifting in the opposite direction when it comes to Israel-Palestine.
Looking through the lens of Israel’s recent rocket offensive in Gaza, 53 percent of Americans 65 and older blame Hamas for the conflict, while 15 percent put the blame on Israel.
Every age group 30 and over more or less agrees with this assessment. But among Americans aged 18 to 29 the numbers are inverted, with 29 percent faulting Israel, 18 percent faulting Hamas, and many others blaming both. Nowadays, young people are more likely to say that Israel acted disproportionately in Gaza, than say that Israel’s response was appropriate. And among young Americans Jews, commentators both in Israel and in the United States are noting a skepticism aimed at Israeli institutions and state policy—a trend arguably represented by J Street’s expanding reach on campus and Open Hillel.
Of course, one might make the argument, introduced above, that young people take a liberal view on Palestine simply because they’re young, and as they age, their views will shift rightward. But there are reasons to believe that, in this situation, the old truism might not apply.
It turns out that sympathy for Palestine in America—like increasing suspicion toward Palestine in Israel—is a matter of demographics. According to Pew, evangelical Christians tend to support Israel for doctrinal reasons, and white people are way more pro-Israel than blacks, Latinos, and other minorities. (And, it so happens, young Americans tend to be both irreligious and racially diverse.)
What does this all mean from a policy perspective? The specifics are hard to ferret out. And the reality is that policy is often as responsive to special interests—like AIPAC, Christians United for Israel, and the like—as they are to slowly shifting sentiments among a given population.
But the demographics don’t lie. For the first time, it’s no longer radical to say that the unconditional support American politicians tend to lend Israeli policy might not, a decade down the road, be quite so unconditional.

Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt and former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti denounced Russia’s recent role in eastern Ukraine and called for a more stringent European response to the crisis during a discussion Monday.
“We are a century after the big European catastrophe of 1914,” Bildt said during his introductory remarks in front of a filled Tsai Auditorium. “And what is happening is that the specter of war is once again haunting Europe.”
The discussion was part of the Summit on the Future of Europe, a series of events hosted by Harvard’s Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, the Berggruen Institute on Governance, and the WorldPost, a Huffington Post product.
Monti and Bildt focused on the role the European Union should play in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Going beyond just sanctions, Bildt called for a more active European policy in Ukrainian affairs.
“In particular, [policy should] help Ukraine to reform its economy, get rid of its vast corruption, to end its insane dependence on heavily-subsidized gas, and to preserve and strengthen the democratic system of Ukraine,” Bildt said.
For his part, Monti spoke to the value of the enlargement of the European Union.
“I, as an Italian citizen would feel today, in terms of security, in terms of [fighting] organized crime, in terms of health safety, etc. much more at risk if all of the area between, say, Slovenia and Estonia were…not yet firmly rooted in the European Union, and of course, I should add, in NATO.”
An economist by trade, Monti served as the Italian prime minister from 2011-2013, leading a technocratic government in response to Italy’s financial crisis. Monti is currently a lifetime senator in Italy.
After serving as Sweden’s prime minister from 1991-1994, Bildt played a crucial role in resolving the conflict in the Balkans and was the first special envoy for the UN Secretary General there. He has been Sweden’s Minister of Foreign Affairs since 2006.
The crisis in Ukraine has revolved around the question of borders, as pro-Russian separatists in the country have fought to redefine the boundary between Russia and eastern Ukraine. The conflict between the rebels and the Ukrainian government reached a ceasefire on September 5.

Two Harvard Law School professors critiqued the legal grounds of President Obama’s military strategy against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria during a lecture Monday.
Speaking to an audience of nearly 200 people at the Law School, professors Jack L. Goldsmith and Noah R. Feldman ’92 analyzed the Obama administration’s legal justifications for the increased use of U.S. military force against ISIS.
Obama has repeatedly condemned ISIS for alleged human rights abuses, and, in a recent address, announced a broad campaign to destroy the militant group.
Both professors dismissed the administration’s legal arguments, with Goldsmith characterizing the efforts as “scrambling to convince the public that there is a legal justification [for the use of military force].”
Obama has defended his policy by citing Article II of the Constitution, which defines the President as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force, which permitted former President George W. Bush to intervene militarily against al-Qaeda and the Iraqi government respectively, the speakers explained.
The President’s power to use military force without consulting Congress is detailed in the 1973 War Powers Resolution, but Feldman said the legislation’s 60-day limit on unapproved military action precludes its application in a conflict that experts predict will last more than two months.
While Goldsmith argued that the two AUMFs provide more plausible legal grounds for President Obama’s strategy, the 2001 AUMF only allows intervention against Al Qaeda and its affiliates—not ISIS—and the 2002 AUMF refers particularly to the use of military force against threats from Iraq.
Feldman identified two general assumptions that he said underpin Obama’s policy.
“First, if [military force] comes from the air, it is not war… and second, if the President is killing Muslims, he is authorized to do this by the two AUMFs,” he said.
Feldman quickly acknowledged that this was an “extremely cynical” analysis, but noted the value of considering this perspective.
The speakers did not express in detail their opinions on the practical merits of Obama’s policy, keeping the focus on the legal rationale for the use of military force without the explicit consent of Congress.
The lecture was organized by the Law School’s chapter of the American Constitution Society.

Students, faculty, and workers were forced to evacuate three building on Harvard’s Longwood Medical Area after officials reported a nitrogen leak in a research facility at 655 Huntington Ave. at 7:10 a.m. Monday.
Buildings at 180 and 188 Longwood Ave. were also evacuated.
The leak was brought under control just after 9:30 a.m., prompting officials to allow workers back into the affected buildings.
Aaron L. Schwartz, a second-year graduate student who was working in his department’s building at 180 Longwood Ave. on Monday, witnessed several fire trucks, police cars, and a helicopter during the evacuation.
Schwartz said he was unsure about the necessity of the evacuations.
“I don't know how bad a leak like that has to be for it to pose a danger to people,” Schwartz said. “I'd speculate that outdoor leaks would be less dangerous.”
A pressure relief valve on a gas tank holding up to 3,000 pounds of liquid nitrogen released the nitrogen outside of the research facility building, according to the Boston Fire Department’s official Twitter account.
Steve MacDonald, a spokesperson for the Boston Fire Department, said the leak did not pose significant danger, as nitrogen is not flammable and the tanks were outside. The buildings were evacuated as a precautionary measure to prevent the nitrogen from displacing oxygen inside the facilities, according to MacDonald.
The Fire Department waited for representatives from a medical gas company to facilitate the shutdown of the tanks. It took approximately an hour for the representatives to arrive and five minutes to shut down the leak. Response to the incident was then turned over to Harvard officials for investigation.
“The city of Boston has a lot of research and medical facilities, and this is just one of the byproducts of having so many facilities,” MacDonald said.
MacDonald also noted that, “colleges usually have a pretty good plan to deal with these [leaks].”

The Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science at the Medical School was recently awarded $30 million in funding from government agencies in response to proposals from the program’s principal researchers.
The funding comes from three government agencies—The National Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and from the Food and Drug Administration.
HiTS, originally funded by a grant from the state of Massachusetts, is home to the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, a space which currently houses undergraduate, graduate, and professional researchers, according to Laura E. Maliszewski, executive director of the lab.
HiTS studies diseases and toxins on a cellular level, aiming to understand bodily responses in an effort to prove what type of medicine would make for a more effective drug.
The $3.4 million given by the FDA will be used first to examine the reaction of heart cells to various processes, but researchers will later experiment with kidney and liver cells as well.
Peter Sorger ’83, head of the Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science, used the example of breast cancer research leading to developments in prostate cancer research to explain how targeted research on one disease or part of the body often leads to a greater understanding of similar cancers or abnormalities.
In this vein, Sorger said these recent grants were as important for “basic research” as for “applied research,” meaning they are meant to explore general questions about how biology works, in addition to targeting specific diseases.
One of the NIH grants will be dedicated toward a better understanding of diseased states in cancer cells.
“We take as many cells as we can, we treat them with as many things as we can, and then we measure as much as we can,” Maliszewski said, explaining the far reaches of the research.
Additionally, Sorger said that all collected data will be open source, meaning it can be accessed for free.
“Our fundamental belief,” he said, “is that universities work in service of the general public.”
The second NIH grant will be used for increased communication with other universities and research centers, training, community outreach, and other programmatic functions, according to Maliszewski. This opens up opportunities for HiTS to fund the involvement of more postdoctoral students in their projects.
Sorger explained the program’s dedication to “bench to bedside” style research, also known as translational research that connects work done on research benches with a patient’s experience. HiTS aims to close the gap between laboratory research and clinical effects by hiring both researchers and practicing doctors. The Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology is located on campus to help bridge the two sides of the pharmacology process.
“You want to take an idea from a lab as quickly as possible and see if it is meaningful for people,” Sorger said. “Our job is not to build a barrier between the little things in cells and the big things in people, but exactly the opposite, namely to break those barriers down.”
Some of the grant money will be used to increase the clinical side of HiTS’s translational mission. The Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will ultimately dedicate part of its building to patient-focused doctors, in addition to the research facilities it currently houses, according to Sorger.

The Cambridge City Council discussed the creation of a discretionary fund, issues related to municipal water billing, and a proposed requirement for developers to hold community sessions at their regular Monday meeting.
Though normally led by Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher, the meeting was jointly presided over by C.J. Dupont, a local sixth grader. Dupont, who was at the meeting in recognition of Cambridge’s decision to declare the month of October as Dwarfism Awareness Month, helped Maher during the opening portion of the meeting, which was held in the Attles Meeting Room at Cambridge Rindge and Latin Public School.
During the meeting, Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen proposed the creation of a discretionary fund as a means of providing the council with a way of responding to local traumas quickly, circumventing the regular bureaucratic processes.
Mazen characterized the fund as an innovative means of responding faster to emergencies, but Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. said he was skeptical of allowing the council to make spending decisions.
“I would trust the expertise of the city manager before I place this into the political arena of the discretionary fund,” Toomey said. “The way we have been operating is the way to do it and its worked...the city taxpayers’ money shouldn’t be subject to the purviews of the city council.”
The council voted 5-3 with one absence to refer the motion to the finance committee.
The council also discussed two policy orders regarding bill payment and the local water supply. The first order involved a complaint against Cambridge’s local water provider and the method by which it was processed. According to Councillor E. Denise Simmons, one local resident was charged an unusually high water bill, and then charged an additional $1,000 to investigate the complaint.
The second order involved the accidental billing of residents for water lost to leakage. Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that he believed the technology was in place to prevent such mistakes and suggested the city reimburse the losses.
“With four [water meter] readings a day I just don’t understand why we haven’t fixed it,” Kelley said. “I don’t know if we can legally do it but it seems fair and if we can legally do it we should.”
Development also came up during the meeting, with Councillor Marc C. McGovern proposing that developers be required to engage with the local community before presenting their plans to the city.
“They’re encouraged [to come before the community], they’re not required. The flip side is that developers are also required to bring a fully designed plan to the planning board,” McGovern said, adding that this led to fully developed plans lacking community input.
“I think we’ve all heard about this being a major flaw in the process,” he added.
Though the council is also considering a ban on smoking in all Cambridge parks, they briefly discussed Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan’s proposal to investigate the feasibility of installing “no smoking marijuana” signs in city playgrounds. Due to Benzan’s absence, the council didn’t take further action.

Administrators behind the revamping of Molecular and Cellular Biology did not have to wait long to gauge the popularity of their new programs, courses, and requirement changes, said Alexander F. Schier, department chair of MCB.
“MCB 60: ‘Cellular Biology and Molecular Medicine,’ our new gateway course, has enrolled more than 100 students, twice as many as expected,” Schier said.
After bringing on more teaching fellows to accommodate high enrollment, Schier, along with his MCB 60 teaching partners Vladimir Denic and Briana Burton, was eager to begin the new class, which implements curricular changes that relate lessons from the classroom to the science seen in news stories.
“The changes we made became possible because molecular and cellular biology has become highly relevant for understanding human physiology and disease,” said Schier. “It is now possible to directly connect most of the biological mechanisms we teach to human disease, ranging from cancer to Ebola.”
The teaching team has worked to leverage the increasing relevance of science at the molecular level to stories of outbreaks and popularly reported science. Highlighting these connections will help make the material more accessible to a broad range of students, Schier said.
“When you spend all your time in the classroom, you’re not paying as much attention to where it will lead you,” said Chris D. M. Mukasa ’17, a prospective MCB concentrator. “It’s really helpful to see how people who have graduated with similar degrees make use of their education in productive ways.”
The new gateway course is part of MCB’s concerted effort to engage concentrators by highlighting the application of MCB to real-world science in addition to fostering a concentration community. Besides MCB 60 and MCB 63: “Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine,” concentration administrators have launched associated programming, like MCB’s inaugural movie night.
The administrators organized a showing of the film “Contagion” for concentrators and pre-concentrators of MCB and Chemical and Physical Biology. Halfway through the movie, a panel of public health experts led a discussion on the epidemiology and biology featured in the movie. The students and the panel—including Barry R. Bloom, professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, and members of Pardis C. Sabeti’s lab, who have worked on sequencing the Ebola genome this fall—arrived at a consensus on the film’s science.
“We MCB concentrators thought they could have done a better job making it seem like an actual pathogen,” said Bianca Mulaney ’16, an MCB concentrator who attended the event, of the fictional disease in Contagion.
Despite disputes with the technical accuracy of the film, Mulaney said that she thought the movie screening was an effective way to open discussion of MCB topics to a broader undergraduate audience.
“This event was a great first foray into the effects of what you might learn as a concentrator on society, in terms of global and public health, economics, security, and social perception,” she said.
In addition, the panel discussion coincided with MCB’s renewed focus on facilitating connections between students, faculty, and scientists.
“In MCB, we emphasize small classes, one-on-one tutorials, faculty affiliates with the houses, and lab research, which together provide a more personalized approach to learning,” said MCB professor Susan Mango.
With small sections and lab groups, MCB 60 not only addresses current events, like the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, but it also features a remodeled format. Rather than lectures and exams alone, the professors seek to engage students in class-wide discussions, lab research projects, quizzes, and dinners at Schier’s home.
“As a curricular change, I think it’s fantastic,” said Alexandra Rojek ’15, of the new gateway course. “I’m excited for the sophomores that are starting now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of the Philippines Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III outlined the positive economic changes his country has undergone over the last two decades in a public address at the Institute of Politics on Monday.
Speaking to a full crowd, which included several members of the Philippine government, at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, Aquino told anecdotes from his childhood, presented individual case studies about economic growth, and answered questions from the audience.
Aquino said that his country has made great strides since the People Power Revolution of 1986, which removed authoritarian leader Ferdinand Marcos from power after 21 years, restoring a democratic government to the country. Aquino emphasized the economic growth over the last few years of his leadership, despite inhibiting factors such as super typhoon Haiyan, which struck the archipelago last November.
Aquino credited “the mandate to change” following the reinstitution of democracy in the Philippines with helping his country recover from Marcos’s rule.
Citing 6.4 percent growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter of the current year—one of the highest growth rates in the region, according to Aquino—and the 2.5 million Filipinos who have raised themselves above the poverty line since 2012-2013—Aquino discussed his government’s dedication to its citizens.
"If a nation's greatest resource is its people, then it's the state's obligation to invest in its people," Aquino said.
He added that between July 2013 and July 2014, the Philippine economy added a net 1.6 million new jobs.
“Coming to the presidency, I inherited many problems which at the time seemed insurmountable,” Aquino said.
“Why...endure the status quo when we can change it,” he added, referencing his inspiration for helping the Philippines recover from some of the economic issues he inherited.
Aquino ended the forum with words of advice to future politicians sitting in the audience.
“Our challenge today is to make the gains even greater and to ensure that transformation becomes an intuitive mainstream of justice and inclusiveness,” Aquino said. “It is my hope that our experiences will motivate those like you from the other side of the world to be influencers who in turn will inspire communities and institutions that will be willing to act.”
Aquino’s visit to Boston marks his first time returning to the city in 31 years. Aquino moved to Boston in 1981 to join his family for two years when they were living in exile during the authoritarian regime in the Philippines.
Aquino’s father, then Philippine senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino, Jr., served as a research fellow at Harvard during his exile and was assassinated upon return to the Philippines in 1983. His mother, Corazon Aquino, became the first female president of the Philippines in 1986 after the fall of Marcos.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 moderated the forum and introduced Aquino as a politician “capable of reaching across the political divide,” noting that this trait is “something we could use in this country.”
Harvard is the second stop on Aquino’s trip to the U.S. He spoke at Boston College on Sunday. He will travel to New York City next to speak at Columbia University and attend and speak at the United Nations Climate Summit on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only about one out of every four candidates who ran in this year’s Undergraduate Council election was female—the greatest gender disparity in candidate declarations in five years. And of those elected, only slightly more than one out of three is a woman, according to a Crimson analysis confirmed by the UC Elections Commission.
With those results, the College’s student government is now two-thirds male and the least gender balanced it has been in four years, leading many top Council leaders to question what changed from the previous year, when the Council was nearly evenly split by gender.
The increased male proportion comes after an election cycle in which Council leaders contend they used new platforms, including a video from University President Drew G. Faust, to encourage undergraduates to run for student government. At the same time, though, the Council has left vacant an appointed committee position meant to encourage gender parity and neglected to follow many recommendations from a 2013 internal report on the issue.
Despite the growing disparity, the UC’s top leaders maintained that they are committed to gender diversity, especially given the prominence of current discussions of sexual assault among undergraduates. Both UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 acknowledged the lopsidedness in this year’s elections and the importance of increasing female representation.
“We definitely noticed that there was a lack of balance compared to last year,” Goffard said. “It was definitely an issue of concern.”
Aisha Bhoori ’18, who unsuccessfully ran a campaign in Ivy Yard last week, expressed a similar sentiment of concern on Monday.
“The people who were watching this campaign…were definitely cognizant of the lack of female representation,” Bhoori said. While she made clear that she believes candidates should be elected based on merit, Bhoori said the paucity of female candidates in this year’s elections was “definitely disconcerting for me as a female.”
The UC has long been “a male-skewed leadership organization,” according to an October 2013 internal report on gender parity. Beginning in 2010, however, the Council passed a bylaw introducing the role of a gender parity representative to its Student Relations Committee and stepped up efforts to encourage students of varying genders to join the body. By 2013, under the leadership of former UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14, the Council hit an almost even gender split among candidates who declared and won positions on the Council.
Slowly, though, many of the recommendations laid out in the report have ceased to be implemented. Last year’s Student Relations Committee did not officially appoint a gender parity representative; the committee’s chair, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, described the position as “pending.”
The 2013 gender parity report also suggested that the UC continue organizing a “Meet the Candidate” night, as required by 2010 legislation passed by the Council. But the event has not been hosted in a couple years, according to Goffard. Additionally, the report recommended introducing a dialogue for first-year students about “gender stereotypes and campus challenges with respect to achieving gender parity.” Goffard said the UC has been in contact with the Office of the Student Life about this initiative, but it has yet to implemented.
He added that part of the broader problem with reports published by the UC is the body’s inability to implement all of the recommendations.
Still, as they have let some measures wane, UC leaders say they have augmented others, including sending emails to student organizations focused on sexuality, race, or gender and holding a campaigning workshop in the Harvard College Women’s Center, according to Mayopoulos.
Given the totality of the body’s efforts, current and former leaders conveyed a difficulty in pinpointing the exact source of this year’s imbalance, beyond pointing to the fact that the current UC president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer are all male.
“Having a male president and male vice president is much different than having a female ticket such as Tara and Jen,” Nasrollahzadeh said. Mayopoulos suggested that seeing two males as the face of the UC this year may have led a disproportionate number of men to run for a position on the Council.
But that cannot be the whole explanation, Raghuveer said, arguing that looking only to the gender of the Council’s top leaders is “a little bit of a simplistic explanation.” Raghuveer said she could not speculate at an alternative explanation. Zhu, for her part, wrote in an email from Uganda on Monday that she is “disappointed by the reversal of gender parity back to more unequal levels.”
Others on the Council said they are less concerned with the gender imbalance of this year’s representatives.
Nasrollahzadeh says that the Council’s Executive Committee—which is now evenly split along gender lines after two spots previously filled by males have become vacant—is a “stronger indication of where gender stands on the Council than elections are.”
And Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, who won an election in Ivy Yard where the other nine candidates were male, said that she did not take gender into account when campaigning and does not personally feel the effect of the Council’s disparity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William Deresiewicz argued his claim that students of elite universities are growingly risk-averse, homogeneous, and career-focused with a panel of faculty members and students on Monday evening.
Hosted by Harvard’s Mahindra Humanities Center, the question-and-answer-style forum involved a panel including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Divisional Dean for Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Executive Dean for Education and Research Fawwaz Habbal, among others. The panel was moderated by Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Center.
Deresiewicz, who received both his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from Columbia, was a faculty member at Yale until 2008, and has since worked as a writer. In his book, which is the focus of his current Ivy League campus tour, he claims that a flawed, overly quantified admissions process and a an increasingly vocation-oriented liberal arts setting—specifically within elite schools like Harvard—has produced a generation of largely scared and undirected young adults.
Students enrolled in elite universities and colleges are “trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same direction, great at what they’re doing but with no idea why they’re doing it,” Deresiewicz writes in his newly-published book “Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life,” which was published in August and of which an excerpt was published by the New Republic in July.
From the panel, Deresiewicz received direct, often critical questions. As Bhabha had the panel members sequentially ask Deresiewicz questions, Khurana asked the author what he “[missed] most about being an academic.”
Deresiewicz advocates for an increase in funding for public institutions of higher learning, which would arguably make college more accessible to students with lower socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as for reforming the college admissions process to be less favorable to students of higher-income families.
“My ultimate hope is that [college] becomes recognized as a right of citizenship, and that we make sure that that right is available to all," he told the audience in his opening remarks.
During the discussion, Deresiewicz criticized many in academia for being complacent with the problems that he ascribes to universities like Harvard, eliciting a response from Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who stood from where he was sitting in the audience.
"I want to take objection to your comment that we think everything is fine. That's not true,” Smith said when the audience was given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel. “I’ve never heard anyone on the faculty tell me that they're satisfied. It would be nice if we could have a conversation about this without the ‘we don’t care.’ That is absolutely not true. I just want to make that very clear. This is not how the faculty do it."
Ari R. Hoffman ’10, a resident tutor in Lowell House who is serving as acting Kirkland House dean this semester, said that he largely agreed with Deresiewicz's diagnosis of an institutional problem within higher learning.
“I think his critique of the University is very trenchant. I think we need more interrogation about the continued relevance and worth of what we’re doing, along with the conviction that these are fighting acts that have to be done. That posture of criticizing, while also affirming, I think, is exactly the attitude that we should take,” Hoffman said.
Khurana, who is also co-Master of Cabot House, reflected on his experience with students and asked Deresiewicz about the practical implementation of his reforms given the heavy societal and economic factors that pressure students to anticipate their careers and futures at growingly earlier points in their lives.
“Fairly or unfairly—probably unfairly—if you get out of [Harvard] with a degree, it's going to be quite difficult for you to not have a comfortable life,” Deresiewicz responded. “By every reasonable standard, the Harvard name is going to open every door that you want to open…. Harvard, because of its wealth, because of its generosity, enables students to graduate with very little debt. I think that the fears are legitimate, but highly exaggerated.”
Deresiewicz also said that, with its role in past innovations in education, Harvard could lead in reforming institutions of higher learning.
“I hope that Harvard can continue, or perhaps resume, that role of courageous innovation not just within the realms of scholarship, but in terms of the structure and social function of higher education that it needs to play, and that I don’t see a lot of institutions of higher education today really taking up,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study co-authored by Harvard professors and researchers has linked antidepressant use during pregnancy to nearly twice the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for the unborn child.
Initially, the researchers also found an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders due to prenatal exposure to antidepressants. However, after reevaluating their data, the authors ultimately concluded that this second link was statistically insignificant in their study.
These findings come amid a wider array of research relating to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy. SSRI drugs include popular antidepressants, including Prozac, Zoloft, and Selexa. Their potential effects on the unborn child have been acutely studied, due to the fact that 14 percent of pregnant women take antidepressants at some point during their pregnancy.
Doctors have long prescribed that women continue antidepressant use during pregnancy, based on the assumption that the effects of a depressed mother would be more severe than those of any medication.
Yet, a growing body of medical literature is disputing this claim. Three different meta-analyses of available data found that women on antidepressants were more likely to give birth prematurely than depressed woman who were not taking medication.
“Many psychiatrists believe that the risks of the medication are less than the risks of remaining depressed during the pregnancy. However, there has never been a study which has shown a better outcome in women who took medication,” said Dr. Alice D. Domar, a senior staff psychologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology at Harvard Medical School.
“Preterm birth can pose significant risks to the baby and there have now been seven studies [on antidepressant use during pregnancy] which suggest a link to autism,” Domar continued.
Domar said that antidepressant use during pregnancy will remain a controversial subject since definitive evidence would require experimental methods that are deemed unethical in the U.S.
Nevertheless, Domar said she supports the exploration of non-pharmacological treatments for depression during pregnancy and regularly counsels women to do the same.
“There are many non-pharmacological treatments which are highly effective in the treatment of depression, including various forms of counseling such as cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, acupuncture, and even massage. Why not try those first?”’

William Deresiewicz, former Yale faculty member and author of “Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life,” discussed his critical claims on higher education with a panel of Harvard faculty members and students on Monday evening. He also sat down with The Crimson, answering questions about his views on the liberal arts, the college admissions process, and what advice he would give to Harvard students.
The Harvard Crimson: Have you met hostility in touring these colleges, especially the ones that you’ve criticized in your work? Do you meet people who are very open to these ideas?
William Deresiewicz: I don’t get hostility, especially given the kind of h ostility that I’ve gotten in print.... Once I actually get in a room with people, they ask me tough questions, but I would not describe it as hostile. They’re often quite responsive to what I have to say.... I think that people start to realize that I’m human, and that I see them as human, and that my interest in all these issues—interest isn’t strong enough of a word—really comes from a place of caring about these students. In fact, the whole book came about because students responded to me with their own concerns.
THC: You’ve talked to a lot of students about their experiences in applying to and attending college. Have you noticed anything unique about Harvard students, anything that makes them different in mindset or the troubles that they have?
WD: No. I really don’t. I don’t want to make anything up. I would say that I hear very similar things, maybe sometimes that the stress is greater because the expectations are higher, or maybe because some of the negative aspects, like competitiveness or pressure, are more intense here.
THC: It seems that you think that liberal arts can be achieved as a proper college experience, without the negative side effects that you say have inculcated within students at elite institutions. Harvard College prides itself as a liberal arts college; what would you say is corrupting the school’s liberal arts setting?
WD: Not every liberal arts college is great; some are quite appalling, as I’ve discovered. Part of the problem is that the term ‘liberal arts’ has come to mean a number of different things. Strictly speaking, it refers to the humanities, the social sciences, and the sciences, understood as discipline for knowledge as a pursuit for its own sake, not for a vocational purpose....
You study the field of knowledge for the sake of learning how knowledge is created, and maybe making more of your own. Which is where the institution’s mission as a research university meets its undergraduate mission as a teaching college: learning from professors who are [creating that knowledge]. Harvard, as a research institution, is certainly a great place—maybe the greatest place. But liberal arts means something a little different when we talk about undergraduate education..... It has to do with an attitude about what your education is for.... The more students treat their education as vocational and use the structure of the liberal arts education for vocational purposes, the less the school is about the liberal arts experience and the more it becomes about something else. I see that happening at a lot of schools.
THC: One of the solutions that you present in your book is an overhaul to the college admissions process, primarily by weighting factors like SAT scores and extra-curricular involvement to level the field for students in lower socioeconomic classes. It seems, though, that you argue that there are characteristics about applicants that aren’t captured at all by these quantitative measurements. How would you reform the admissions process to take these things into account?
WD: It’s moments like this when I’m cornered that I like to say that my business is complaining, not answers, which I’ve stolen from someone else. I realize that admissions is a difficult technical problem. I don’t think that it should be that hard to set principles for what we’re looking for. It is difficult to ask: how do you actually put that into practice, and how do you put it into practice in need to be ten times bigger than they are. Admittedly, they probably cost a lot of money to run, but we may just need to to devote more manpower. It would cost a lot of money, but the decisions that these offices are reaching seem to be so consequential that I almost feel like society should demand a better [process]. But, of course, my primary solution [to this problem] is public higher education, where we don’t have to worry about evaluating 400,000 kids for 10,000 slots. We could have 400,000 kids and 200,000 slots.”
THC: Is there anything that you’d like to convey to Harvard students, in particular?
WD: First of all, I want them to know that I don’t hate them, and I don’t blame them for most of this. I blame the adults that have created the system.... People have said to me over and over that you can get a great education at school X, but you have to work for it or you have to fight for it. You have to resist a lot of the forces that are pushing you in certain directions—pushing you to compete, pushing you to do a million different things, pushing to think of yourself and your education in a certain way. You have to resist all that peer, parental, and social pressure. If you do that, this could be a wonderful place to get an education. You don’t have a transfer. But you do have to fight the institution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It had been 12,327 days since a Harvard graduate caught a touchdown pass in an NFL regular season game.
On Sunday, Baltimore Ravens fullback Kyle Juszczyk ’13 became the most recent player to accomplish the feat, the school’s first player to do since former Crimson punter and wide receiver Pat McInally ’75 scored a touchdown for the Cincinnati Bengals on December 21, 1980.
Juszczyk scored the first touchdown of his NFL career on his first NFL reception, a nine-yard pass from quarterback Joe Flacco with 7:24 left in the second quarter. The catch put the Ravens ahead of the host Cleveland Browns, 10-7, in a game that Baltimore would ultimately win 23-21.
The game was a homecoming for Juszczyk, having grown up in Medina, Ohio, 33 miles south of Cleveland.
Juszczyk played tight end while with the Crimson and was a two-time All-American and three-time All-Ivy League performer. He concentrated in Economics and lived in Pforzheimer during his time in Cambridge.
Juszczyk was drafted by the Ravens in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft and spent most of his rookie season on special teams. His role as an offensive player has increased during the 2014 season after the team released fullback Vonta Leach during the offseason and halfback Ray Rice on Sept. 8.
This season Juszczyk has started two of the Ravens’ (2-1) first three games, and after three catches yesterday has 54 receiving yards on the season. He is first all-time among Harvard tight ends in receptions (125), receiving yards (1,576), and touchdowns (22).
Juszczyk is one of three former Crimson players to have appeared in an NFL game this season, along with Cleveland Browns defensive end Desmond Bryant ’09 and Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
The Ravens hope to extend their two-game winning streak on Sunday when they play host to the Carolina Panthers—and Harvard hopes it does not have to wait another 12,327 days for its next NFL touchdown reception.

The Harvard men’s tennis team continued its fall season this past weekend, competing at the Porsche Napa Valley classic in California and the Farnsworsth Ivy Plus Tournament, hosted by Princeton.
The squad showcased its strength and depth on both coasts this weekend, as its freshmen made a splash and its upperclassmen turned in solid performances.
Over at Princeton, the Crimson faced off against opponents ranging from Ivy League foes Columbia and Yale to out-of-conference opponents such as Michigan and Notre Dame.
While eight Harvard players were in competition at Princeton, four Crimson players were playing on the other side of the country in St. Helena, Calif. at the tournament hosted by Berkeley.
Both tournaments ran from Friday through Sunday and were individual tournaments, rather than team tournaments.  Out in Napa Valley, the tournament was set up with eight flights that all played an initial round robin stage, followed by an elimination shootout. The Ivy Plus Tournament was set up similarly, except that the final rounds were divided into a championship and a consolation bracket with full matches.
On Friday, the team got off to an exceptional start at the Napa Valley Classic.  In fact, the Crimson did not drop a single match, going 6-0 due to strong performances from all team members, including sophomore Sebastian Beltrame, co-captain Denis Nguyen, junior Nicky Hu, and freshman Kenny Tao.
Entering his sophomore season, Beltrame showed that he will be a force to be reckoned with this year. After winning his round robin pool, the sophomore from Windermere, Fla. played in the Solinco Wild Card Shootout, which consisted of a 10-point tiebreak and offered the chance to obtain a wildcard entry to a future U.S. Tennis Association event.
Beltrame needed extra points to rally past Soren Hess-Olesen of the Texas in the semifinals, 13-11, and then rode that momentum to win the tournament, taking down teammate Hu in the final.
“It was a really good weekend,” co-captain Alex Steinroeder said.  “We were trying out some new doubles pairings with upperclassmen with freshmen, and it worked out really well.  All of the freshmen are fitting into the team really well.  Out in Napa, we were playing some top-quality competition and doing exceptionally well.  Seeing Sebastian win the tournament was an incredibly encouraging sign.”
Back in New England, the Crimson posted an equally strong performance.  Two players were able to make it to the finals of their flight, and two more made it all the way to the semifinals.
In the Cordish Draw, freshman Jean Thirouin advanced to the finals before falling 6-4, 6-1, to the Wolverines’ Run Hao Hua.  In the Jadwin Draw, sophomore Andrew Ball lost in the finals in a hard-fought match, 7-6(4), 6-3 to Buffalo’s Pablo Alvarez.   Steinroeder and junior Conor Haughey each fell in the semifinals.
“It’s all developmental at this point,” senior Shaun Chaudhuri said.  “It’s all about getting experience for the upcoming spring season.  Freshmen are getting used to playing on a team and what the dynamics of that look like.  So this weekend was great because we were able to see where our level is at as a team.  Both crews did great.”

The Harvard coed sailing team finished in second place at the Nevins Trophy Regatta, topping off a weekend that resulted in four top-10 overall team finishes for the Crimson sailors.
NEVINS TROPHY
The squad’s best performance this weekend was the Nevins Trophy Regatta at King’s Point, N.Y., where Harvard’s coed team, led by senior Brian Drumm, junior Marek Zeleski and junior captain Andrew Mollerus as skippers sailed the team to a second-place finish out of 20 college teams. After a gusty day on Saturday, the regatta was cut short on Sunday to one race due to a lack of wind.
Drumm and junior crew Jake Bradt were among the most consistent boats in the A-division, finishing within top-five in four of their races and taking a third-place finish overall.
“It was great to have [Bradt] back in the boat this weekend,” said Drumm, who has not sailed with Bradt since last spring. “Our main goal was to get back to where we were last season and develop consistency.”
The biggest surprise of the regatta came out of the Laser C-division, where Zeleski came in a close second to Georgetown’s boat.
Zeleski won two of the first five races on Saturday, and his performance has excited Harvard coach Mike O’Connor.
“Of all of our players, [Zeleski] put in the most time and effort this summer,” O’Connor said. “His execution is very good right now, and his performance was an important part of our finish at King’s Point.”
The Nevins Trophy Regatta is one that the Crimson has dominated in recent years, finishing within the top two at each of its last four showings at King’s Point.
CENTRAL SERIES 2
In a more local affair, Harvard participated this weekend in the Central Series 2, the second of a two-part series hosted by Boston College on the Charles River. Unlike the first part of the series, in which the Crimson won the overall team event, this weekend Harvard finished in eighth place.
In the A-division, the Crimson was led by freshman Nick Sertl with sophomore crew Nomin Jagdagdorj, whose boat finished second by placing within the top-10 in all of the 15 races.
“One of the biggest keys for me was having [Jagdagdorj] as my crew,” Sertl said. “We did not try to win any races, and I think that that mentality is the reason we did so well.”
Junior skipper Adam Brodheim and junior crew Cara Kennedy Cuomo sailed in the B-division, where they came in 12th overall, finishing within the top-10 in seven races.
HATCH BROWN TROPHY
One of the more unique regattas of the fall season was the Hatch Brown Trophy, an event hosted by MIT, in which sailors race NC Firefly boats, an early 20th-century sailboat rare in college sailing.
The Crimson sailed well throughout the regatta. The strongest showing came from senior skipper Gram Slattery and sophomore crew Julia Lord, whose seven top-five finishes propelled them to a fifth-place finish within the B-division.
The A-division boat, skippered by seniors Michael Drumm and Rebecca Frankel, with sophomore Bennett Capozzi serving as the crew, took 15th-place.
MRS. HURST BOWL
The fourth regatta in which Harvard raced was the Mrs. Hurst Bowl, a women’s event hosted by Dartmouth. The Crimson finished in 10th place. In the B-division, junior skipper Sophie Bermudez and senior Ashleigh Inglis placed sixth overall.
In the A-division, freshman skipper Taylor Ladd and junior crew Kristina Jakobson finished in 15th place overall.
“Going up against upperclassmen with a lot more experience than me was definitely the hardest part,” Ladd said.
According to O’Connor, Ladd is simply on a learning curve just like all freshmen sailors, and he is confident in her and the rest of his team’s ability to perform at a high level for the rest of the fall season and beyond.

Senior running back Andrew Casten knew he was going to have a big workload on Friday night when the Harvard football team took on Holy Cross. But he definitely didn't foresee his immediate success.
“To be honest, I really didn’t know what to expect,” Casten said after the game.
No one could blame him. After all, this was Casten’s first career start in a college backfield.
But thrust into the spotlight after injuries to two other Crimson running backs, Casten made it seem like there was no transition at all. Over the next several hours, the senior rushed for three touchdowns and amassed over 150 yards on the ground.
“The thing about Andrew is he’s a much improved player even from last year,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He gives us big back capability with great feet and vision, a combination that’s great.”
On opening night under the bright lights of Harvard Stadium, the senior ran his team to a 41-18 win over Holy Cross.
From the outset, Casten established himself as a threat and outgained all Crusaders rushers combined.
Casten’s stats were even more striking considering that he ran for 151 yards and one touchdown all of last season. On Friday night, Casten needed only 17 carries to top both marks.
He also became the first Harvard player to rush for three touchdowns in a single game since Treavor Scales ’13 did so midway through the 2012 season.
“We knew we were going to have to run the football and take it to these guys,” Casten said. “Our offensive line is the strongest group of this team…. Those guys open up the holes and make my job easy.”
Harvard’s first score of the season came on Casten’s first carry of the game. Taking the ball at the three-yard line, the running back absorbed a hit and plowed into the end zone for the touchdown.
Two more quarters would elapse before Casten added an additional six points. With Harvard clinging to a two-point lead, the senior received a handoff from quarterback Conner Hempel and blasted past the Crusader defense to go nearly untouched for an 18-yard score.
The back had not finished, though. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Casten completed a 52-yard Harvard drive by muscling in a three-yard run for his third touchdown of the day.
The 5’11”, 210-pound senior operates differently than most of the backs on the Crimson roster. While junior Paul Stanton—the team’s normal starter—earned second team All-Ivy honors last year by skirting and blowing by defenders, Casten relies on his power to gain yards.
“It’s the old thunderfoot and lightfoot,” Murphy said. “You can probably guess who’s lightfoot and who’s thunderfoot.”
Harvard can only benefit from the different looks out of the backfield. When Stanton returns, it’s possible that Murphy will lean on Casten in short-yardage situations.
But Friday also demonstrated Casten’s ability to break loose for a big gain early in the fourth quarter. Thanks to a hole created by blockers up front, Casten burst through the line and made his way to the left sideline, along which he ran furiously until a defender brought him down.
The play totaled 52 yards. By contrast, the longest run of the 2013 season for Casten went for a mere 12.
“The [offensive line] blew the guys off the ball,” Casten said. “I don’t know if the safety wasn’t coming up, but I somehow made him miss and was chugging along down the sideline. [Stanton] would have scored there.”
Stanton remains questionable for this Saturday, so it’s possible that Casten will receive another start in an Ivy League game against Brown. Regardless of whose name is called, the Crimson will hope to see more of the same from its backfield.
“Our offense starts with the front line, and those guys were outstanding [Friday], in my opinion,” Hempel said. “Casten just did a great job hitting the holes, making people miss.”

Happy Tuesday, Harvard! We hope your week is off to a good start. With the new Pasta Flyer food truck in the plaza (all gluten-free!), a newly named Deanship, this week's salmon burger grill special, yesterday’s autumnal equinox, and add/drop without a fee deadline (oops, thought you knew!), it almost seems like we’re getting a little bit of a fresh start on the semester. Whether that means finally getting out of the class you haven’t attended since shopping week, getting to debut that brand-new (or, let’s be real, last season) fall wardrobe, debating how to pronounce “Edgerley” with your blockmates over dinner, or finally getting all the gluten-free pasta and salmon burgers you never knew you needed, we hope it gave you the chance to restart a bit. The timing couldn’t be better, with October (and an onslaught of midterms and paper deadlines) right around the corner. Enjoy it!
IN THE ATMOSPHEREToday will be a sunny and gorgeous 71 degrees, before dropping to around 52 at night. If this is what this year’s Boston fall is going to be like, we’ll take it! All we need is some color foliage and freshly-picked apples, and we’ll be good to go.
