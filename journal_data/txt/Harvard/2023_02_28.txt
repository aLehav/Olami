After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There’s nothing to do here.”
“I hate this city.”
“Boston is so boring.”
These are all statements that I’ve heard shared between friends or thrown over dining hall meals at Harvard College; it is shockingly common to hear general disdain for the Boston area here at Harvard. Many students are convinced that Boston is lackluster and offers no cultural scene outside a handful of big-name attractions like the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Faneuil Hall, or the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.
Where does this misunderstanding of Boston and its cultural scene come from, and, more importantly, how can we address it?
Unpacking this question first requires reflecting on why I personally love Boston. I am from a small town in rural Maine. My family is full of avid Red Sox fans, so we made the six-hour trek to Boston at least once a year to watch the game. When I was little, I called it “the city,” since Boston was the closest place with over 100,000 residents and felt like the most crowded an area could get.
When I came to Boston, I found it overflowing with things that were unavailable in my hometown: stunning museums, never-ending lists of restaurants, and weekly musical performances. My love for the city existed long before I knew about college acceptances, but now that I live in Cambridge, I am especially appreciative to have a rich cultural scene next door.
Perhaps negative attitudes come down to a difference in rural versus urban perspectives. Often, it is people hailing from major cities that I hear complaining about Boston the most. Boston is unique in its layout; its twists and turns are hard to navigate, half of its good restaurants are literally underground, and it never was advertised to be a loud and overstimulating city — except when Yankees fans clash with Bostonians at Fenway, or when the Montreal Canadiens play the Bruins. It is markedly different compared to other American cities. Most importantly, it doesn’t throw all of its gems at your feet; it requires curiosity and time.
Yet most Harvard students won’t give Boston the energy it deserves — a disconnect that demonstrates students’ active attempts to stay within the “Harvard Bubble.” Harvard students often believe that the entire world centers around their little pocket of East Cambridge. Time is a precious commodity on campus, and people are often unwilling to look into what isn’t easily accessible. This results in a lack of time invested in getting to know Boston, because people are only scratching the surface of what the city has to offer.
Boston deserves so much more than this casual dismissal. The city has been a cultural center of the United States since it was founded. Here, the American Revolution brewed, the first art collections grew in size, and some of the greatest minds gathered. However, people have stopped believing in Boston’s present capability as a cultural hub. Yet take a moment to look around you: New England’s greatest museums surround us, historical sights abound, and concerts, festivals, and events occur nearly every week.
Before you complain about Boston, I urge you to take time to actually acquaint yourself with the city. It isn’t as sprawling as L.A., or as bustling as New York City, but it never promised that it would be these things. Stop looking for the familiar in the city, and find what is unique.
As a native of Maine, not Massachusetts, I’m nowhere near an expert when it comes to knowing Boston’s ins and outs. However, I carry an immense love for the city and its cultural scene, and exploring it has brought me so much joy. Here are a few of my favorite things to do in the city that I hope at least one more Harvard student looks into and appreciates:
Tours at the Nichols House Museum
Grabbing pizzelle at Parziale’s in the North End
Browsing shoes at Bodega 
Following the historical Native American Trail, in lieu of the Paul Revere Trail
Hitting Boston’s surprising large number of speakeasies 
Catching a film at Coolidge Corner Theater
Dancing at Mariel Underground 
Getting historical at the Gibson House
Free weekday student coffee at Cafe Landwer (not very underground, but underappreciated)
Walking through the ruins of Schoolmaster Hill 
Getting radical at The Lucy Parsons Center
Studying at the Boston Athenaeum
…And much, much more. Before passing judgment on Boston’s culture scene, take a second to explore the city that surrounds you — its wonders may surprise you.

It has been several years since we’ve had a punky ‘screw you’ hit from P!NK, but her new album, “TRUSTFALL,” arrived when we thought we had seen the last of the 2000s rock-pop sweetheart. The rock musician had been relatively off the radar until she released the single “Irrelevant” in response to the reversal of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court. This news spurred P!NK out of her hiatus with this subsequent 13-song album hot on the heels of “Irrelevant.” “TRUSTFALL” is reminiscent of the punk-rock pop of P!NK’s previous albums, offering an inspiring message to get the listener through the hard times in life.
The album’s songs fluctuate between slow emotional ballads and upbeat dance floor hits — an intentional choice on P!NK’s part. She said in an interview with Billboard that the songs are ordered to reflect the ups and downs of life. “When I Get There,” P!NK’s first song on the album, is a cathartic conversation with a loved one she has recently lost. Only piano instrumentals accompany her raspy vocals as she pleads to see this person again. Although she begins the album in a rather sorrowful tone, she quickly shifts to an upbeat tone with the titular song “TRUSTFALL.” She ditches the acoustics for electronic backups and basks in the idea of feeling safe and supported by someone new. The song is about putting one’s faith in someone else; it most definitely is a departure from the messages of P!NK’s feisty old hits like “So What” and “Blow Me (One Last Kiss).”
As the album progresses, the theme of trusting someone to be there for you during hard times is further developed. In fact, this message feels belabored halfway through the album. It is obvious that P!NK has found the trust she has been searching for in her personal life, but she seems a little too reliant on the default pop song. The messages lack nuance, and, despite guest features like The Lumineers and First Aid Kit on tracks “Long Way to Go” and “Kids in Love” respectively, offering contributions from different music genres, the trajectory of each song is the same. The choruses are repetitive and the rhymes are predictable, especially in the most popular song off the album, “Never Gonna Not Dance Again,” which boasts over 45 million streams on Spotify.
P!NK gets personal towards the end of the album. She has been open about her rocky relationship with her husband Carey Hart, and it is evident through her lyrics in the consecutive songs “Hate Me” and “Lost Cause.” The two songs are contradictory in that “Hate Me” bitterly allows the listener to villainize P!NK, but “Lost Cause” begs the listener to not give up on P!NK’s ability to love. She sings, “Say you’re sick of my guts / but don't tell me I’m a lost cause.”
“TRUSTFALL” wrestles with feelings of forgiveness, anger, and companionship. Its reinforcing messages of not being alone through the difficulties of life are well-suited to the introspective listener. While dance breaks filter throughout the album to release some tension from the heavier topics, there are also moments for contemplative listening. Similar to how many music lovers could not go through life without having songs to connect to, P!NK understands that life is nearly impossible without having trust in the people around you.

The issue of terrible apologies is a widely accepted truth, and it's a sentiment that resonates with anyone who has been on the receiving end of one. However, poorly crafted public apologies, riddled with excuses and victim blaming, are not limited to celebrities, politicians, or bloggers — they are ubiquitous and universally recognized as bad.
Despite our ability to spot them, it still remains challenging to apologize effectively. In light of this, Marjorie Ingall and Susan McCarthy wrote “Sorry, Sorry, Sorry: The Case for Good Apologies” to explore the nature of apologies, the perfect language to craft one, and the reasons why they present a challenge for all people alike. Combining their decade-long study of apologies posted on their website, SorryWatch.com, with a diverse repository of outside research in psychology, history, and pop culture, Ingall and McCarthy thoughtfully craft an 11-chapter argument that details the undeniable value of apologies in modern society. The book further examines the art of apology with humorous and refreshing candor, critically assessing a history of bad apologies to present the ultimate how-to guide for avoiding the pitfalls of a bad apology.
The book starts off by presenting a case for why apologizing is necessary and increasingly important in today’s quickly changing landscape of interpersonal relationships. While the modern sense of apology seems to be a still-developing craft, Ingall and McCarthy attempt to properly define this through a critical examination of what constitutes good apologies as opposed to bad ones. In their claim that not all apologies are the same, Ingall and McCarthy present a foolproof method for good apologizing in a six-step formula, good apology checklists, and bad apology bingo templates.
One of the strengths of "Sorry, Sorry, Sorry" is the authors' ability to draw on a wide range of examples to illustrate their points. In every chapter of the book, Ingall and McCarthy seamlessly pair engaging storytelling with factual evidence to establish a style of narration similar to Malcolm Gladwell’s — a casually informative yet highly compelling one. Ingall and McCarthy draw in readers by sharing examples of apologies across fields of study, time periods, and scopes of human relationships. Whether it be a reference to research experiments, historical events, or personal anecdotes, the diverse presentation of supporting evidence exemplifies that apologies are an inherently interdisciplinary and multifaceted phenomenon. By emphasizing the regularity of bad apologies, the book is both engaging and relatable, as readers are likely to see themselves or people they know in the examples provided.
Ingall and McCarthy consistently characterize the act of apology as a universal experience in a number of ways. For instance, Ingall and McCarthy emphasize that dissociating apologies with the apologizer is important in understanding that bad apologies are not always correlated to faulty moral character. Rather than praising or villainizing apologizers for the quality of their apologies, Ingall and McCarthy emphasize that good people are capable of making bad apologies. Thus, if all people have a potential to both give and receive bad apologies, there is a clear necessity for training the skills needed to make a good apology.
Ingall and McCarthy also provide a plethora of valuable action items that effectively bridge conceptual ideas with practical implications. Not only are there explicit step-by-step guides on how to formulate and assess good apologies, there is also a portion of the book dedicated to the importance of understanding cultural nuances when contemplating how to navigate apologizing in a jungle of societal imbalances. For instance, Ingall and McCarthy investigate the role of gender politics and societal norms in the way that society perceives different apologies, ultimately providing readers with a more holistic and conscientious commentary on pragmatic apologizing.
The central argument of the book culminates in the fact that apologies are not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength. By taking responsibility for our actions and acknowledging the harm we have caused, we demonstrate our willingness to do better and to make amends.
The authors suggest, “An apology doesn't mean you're weak. It means you're strong enough to take responsibility for your actions and to try to make things right.”
Ingall and McCarthy offer a wealth of insights into why apologies are so challenging to get right. They explain that part of the problem is that many have been socialized to view apologies as admissions of guilt or weakness. As a result, people often shy away from apologizing or do so in a way that minimizes their responsibility. This can lead to further harm, as it fails to address the underlying issues and can leave the person who was harmed feeling unheard and invalidated.
The authors outline a number of key components of a good apology, such as acknowledging the harm, taking responsibility, expressing remorse, and making a commitment to change. They also emphasize the importance of listening to the person who was harmed and being open to feedback. To craft a good apology, the authors suggest that we need to shift our mindset and view apologies as an opportunity to demonstrate our integrity and commitment to repairing the harm we have caused.
Overall, "Sorry, Sorry, Sorry" is a valuable and insightful book that offers practical advice for anyone looking to craft a good apology. It is a must-read for those who have struggled to apologize or have been on the receiving end of a bad apology. By demonstrating the power of genuine remorse and a commitment to change, the authors make a compelling case for the ability to craft effective apologies in our personal and professional lives.

Samantha Shannon’s best-selling novel “The Priory of the Orange Tree” brought readers into a world where magic lies hidden in the fruit of the earth. In her newest novel, “A Day of Fallen Night,” Shannon has yet again invited us to eat of the not-so-forbidden magic fruit. “A Day of Fallen Night,” a striking standalone prequel to “Priory,” interweaves the stories of three women — Tunuva, Glorian, and Dumai — from three wildly different fantastical cultures. Yet they are united through their devotion to their loved ones and quests to hunt down the demonic wyrms which threaten their world. “A Day of Fallen Night” sometimes struggles with the magnitude of its scope, but above all it is a striking, women-led addition to the world of modern epic fantasy.
“A Day of Fallen Night” may take place in the same world as “The Priory of the Orange Tree,” but it stands by itself. Shannon establishes a new cast of characters, unique threats, and a sweeping plotline within the 850 pages of “Fallen Night.” While some might be daunted by the book’s length, it is refreshing that “Fallen Night” is a truly self-contained novel. Its end vaguely hints at the events of “Priory,” but understanding the novel doesn’t hinge upon familiarity with the plot of “Priory.”
However, the pacing within this standalone novel isn’t perfect. “A Day of Fallen Night” suffers from a disjointed flow that makes following its characters confusing. Shannon attempts to connect various locations, characters, and wars in one chronological plotline, but keeping the piece chronological requires awkward jumps in time and location. Some long journeys are summarized in one paragraph, while others take entire chapters, making the story feel unevenly sluggish or breakneck.
While the central plot can become confusing, the individual themes of the novel are much easier to follow. The novel brings into focus an idea that is familiar to us all: love. “A Day of Fallen Night” is an ode to love in its many forms — whether it be between family members, friends, or lovers. No matter how sweeping the plot becomes, Shannon grounds the magical world of the novel in strong individual relationships that showcase the connective power of love. Tunuva supports her sisterhood, Glorian battles the world for her unborn child, and Dumai sacrifices everything for her family and friends. Shannon also champions inclusivity in the novel, representing relationships between women and between men, romantic and platonic.
Additionally, the overall diversity and strength of female characters in the novel is impressive. Shannon, as a master in “feminist fantasy,” highlights the sheer power of strong women in the novel. Tunuva, Glorian, and Dumai are all warriors in one way or another, brave in the face of danger. They vitally embrace their ferocity without relinquishing their emotions and vulnerability. While so-called “strong female characters” in fantasy can sometimes appear cartoonish and one-dimensional, the women of “Fallen Night” have depth and come across as entirely realistic.
“A Day of Fallen Night” is not for the faint of heart; its length is staggering and its epic, sometimes overwhelming plot can trip up those unaccustomed to the high fantasy genre. However, its focus on the power of love, as well as its empowering and relatable female heroes, ground the work in a world that feels familiar. Shannon has condensed a sweeping fantasy world into one novel, and although the pacing can leave the reader befuddled, in the end, it celebrates the triumph of strong women and the love between them.

“What would it take not to die without a word?” award-winning author Rachel Kadish asked while writing her 2017 historical fiction work, “The Weight of Ink.”
The story was borne of a nagging question — a pinpointing of something that bothered her. She identifies this questioning as a representative germination point for all of her stories. For “The Weight of Ink,” the question came as a response to Virginia Woolf’s imagination of the fate of Shakespeare’s hypothetical equally talented sister: “Alas, she never wrote a word.”
Determined to investigate to what lengths a female writer in the 17th century would need to go in order to evade Woolf’s dismal sentence, Kadish crafted a story that interweaves the lives of a modern female historian and a rabbi’s female scribe living in the mid-1600s. The book, a recipient of the 2017 National Jewish Book Award, serves as an apt testament to Kadish’s brilliantly insightful approach to storytelling across her literary corpus. A fiction fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts and Massachusetts Cultural Council and recipient of numerous literary awards, it’s clear Kadish has joined her own characters in rejecting the fate of Woolf’s female Shakespeare.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, she described her successful approach to writing in a neatly consolidated equation: “People, characters, plus pressure equals plot.” Her stories indeed explore the distinct reactions of characters to the pressures acting upon them, critically analyzing the world through the lens of these two forces.
For Kadish, stories have always been her cherished keys to understanding the world. “I loved books. They were these precious, life-changing objects, but I didn’t think very much about what it took to write them,” she said.
Aside from a screenwriter family friend, she turned to mentors outside her circle for inspiration in the writing craft. She attributes parts of her perspective on stories and storytelling to her education, citing exceptional insights from her third and eighth grade teachers.
“Each of them just opened up worlds for me. Those were teachers who gave me so much as far as understanding what a book can be and what it can do and how we interact with books.”
Yet she recalled one teacher with particular fondness, bashfully characterizing her mentorship as an “outsized gift” bestowed upon her during her undergraduate studies at Princeton.
The gift? Studying under the late literary legend Toni Morrison, who also served as her thesis advisor.
“It’s a good thing in life to know how lucky we are in the moment,” she said of her time learning from Morrison. “Everything she said, I was sitting there going, ‘Remember this, remember this.’”
Her teachers weren’t the only ones who sculpted her view of stories. Kadish also spoke of what she learned from the Covid-19 pandemic and her consequent foray into a new medium of experiencing stories. When asked about her personal share of the pandemic’s impact, she laughed.
“During the pandemic, we were isolated from the world. At the same time, I had two teenagers who had virtual school for a year. That’s not exactly solitude,” she said. “I felt like I was living in someone else’s novel, which is terrifying because I don’t know where the plot is going.”
In response to 2020’s unique uncertainties and challenges, she shared her longing for external human contact through storytelling — a desire she sought to satiate through audiobooks.
“I needed that human voice, that human contact of someone telling you the story. I switched over from reading on the page to listening to audiobooks.”
Audiobooks enabled her to engage with stories in a yet unexplored format, especially while busy with other tasks like cooking or walking the dog (named Henry, short for Henry David Thoreau). In that sense, the pandemic shifted Kadish’s very relationship to the act of storytelling.
Still, she counts the pandemic as one of life’s many inevitable interruptions. Interruptions, she said, never get the opportunity to derail her writing.
“Life is going to be full of interruptions. A rich, full life is full of interruptions,” she said.
She initially felt that life’s necessary disturbances placed her at odds with writer John Gardner’s assertion that a novel should be a “vivid and continuous dream.” In the middle of interruptions like the pandemic, she found herself asking, “How am I supposed to write in a vivid and continuous dream?”
Her struggle with this question prompted a lightbulb moment.
“The vivid and continuous dream is for the reader,” she said. “Even if I can’t get it while I’m writing, or I can only get it in bits and pieces, it’s my job to put together that vivid and continuous dream for the reader.”
For Rachel Kadish, it’s essential to be forgiving of oneself despite the often unattainable idealizations of a writer — both story and storyteller are, after all, set in the midst of living.
“Most of us write in the middle of the muddle of life,” Kadish said. “That’s as I want it and how it should be.”

The internet has permanently changed the way people express themselves. Many words no longer mean what they used to. Some feelings and thoughts can no longer be conveyed within the constraints of language. So we, the generation that grew up on the internet, often turn to what may be my favorite invention of all time: the emoji.
As is often said, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” Emojis are full of nuances and complexities that extend beyond the capacities of verbal vocabulary. Mad at someone, but not really? Use an emoji. Want to say something sort of (extremely) embarrassing and diminish the consequences? Use an emoji. Accidentally open a message you don’t know how to respond to (you meant to leave them on delivered)? Use an emoji.
And so, without further ado, here are my top ten niche(ish) emojis, in no particular order, and how I like to use them.
1. “worried face”
Astounded? Flabbergasted? Completely taken aback? This is the emoji for you. Apple has named this emoji “worried face,” but if I send this to you, I’m not worried about a situation — I’m worried about you. Whatever you just said has left me with no words — only emojis.
2. “beans”
I was appalled to find out that despite there being over 400 types of beans in the world, these three dark kidney beans are the only ones that exist in Apple’s emoji roster. I have so many questions. Why kidney beans? Why three? Unfortunately, we will never know. Use this emoji sparingly. You’ll know when the time is right.
3. “troll”
Considering the popularity of the term “trolling,” I am disgusted at the underwhelming usage of this troll emoji. “Troll” is cute, lovable, and the perfect response to any controversial or provocative text in the groupchat.
4. “hundred points symbol”
This one is a classic. It’s the perfect affirmative — punchy, excited, the slightest bit ironic. The two red underlines add so much flavor and emotion. The hundred points symbol is truly a joy to send and receive.
5. “anatomical heart”
The people have decided that the classic heart emoji is out. Some have turned to “<3” to fill the emptiness in their keyboards. Others have turned to the “anatomical heart.” This emoji makes me feel smart — intelligent, even. I won’t major in STEM, but using this emoji makes up for it.
6. “woman in lotus position”
Look at her: meditating, healing, protecting her mental health. When I use this emoji, I’m practicing self-care. If everyone aspired to become the “woman in lotus position” emoji, the world would finally know peace.
7. “eleven o’clock”
Trying to figure out when to meet someone? Send them your proposed time via any one of the analog clock emojis. Confuse them a little. Make them work. Let them figure it out.
8. “disappointed face”
This is by far the saddest emoji of all time. With its downcast eyes and small, dejected frown, I just want to give this emoji a hug. Use only when absolutely necessary — this one breaks hearts.
9. “glasses”
Everyone uses the “sunglasses” emoji, but “glasses” is devastatingly overlooked. If I send you this emoji, you just said something so out of line that I needed to get my glasses and read it again. It is truly powerful.
10. “office building”
This emoji intrigues me. What kind of office is this? Where is it? Why are there so many windows? Who’s in there? Use the “office building” emoji when attempting to be mysterious. “Where are you?” “🏢” You’ll never know.

The cast of “Saturday Night Live” opened its 48th season by taking on a new target: themselves. The first cold open of the latest season featured the host Miles Teller and cast member Andrew Dismukes playing Peyton and Eli Manning in their NFL segment “Best of Monday Night Football.” Instead of football, the brothers critique SNL itself — a move very characteristic of a pre-Zuckerberg definition of “meta” — and it’s uncomfortable, but that’s the goal. Cast members deliver intentionally clunky and painfully pandering lines while the Mannings attack the sketch’s “humiliating attempts at relevance.” It’s refreshing to see the show recognize how repetitive its format can get. It’s even funny when the purposely disjointed cold open falls apart in ways that are only slightly more exaggerated than past sketches. For a show that satirizes others, it’s nice to see that they can make fun of themselves, too. But is this self-awareness enough to redeem recent sketches where discomfort wasn’t part of the joke, or is self-deprecation a sign that “Saturday Night Live” is dead?
SNL has outlived the days when monolithic entertainment was still possible — when most television viewers would tune in to the same popular programming. Now, the comedy landscape is more niche than ever. Sitcoms with live audiences and tight shooting schedules have been replaced by television series, which are polished enough to rival movie productions. However, that’s acting under the assumption that people are even watching television. Many young people are pivoting away from TV altogether in favor of social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
TikTok humor works in the same way SNL does: It captures instances that are either so shocking or so serendipitous that they could only be of the moment. The thing with TikTok, though, is that this impromptu appearance is most often a fake out: TikTok videos simulate the appearance of live moments, but in reality, these videos were likely shot multiple times and edited in order for the beats to line up perfectly. When a TikTok is funny, the guise of reality is almost imperceptible. TikTok humor succeeds when it hides its seams.
SNL is the opposite. It’s a high-effort production — and it doesn’t try to hide this fact either. SNL writers create sketches based on events that often occurred days before, the small cast must perform roles they might not always fit, they have one chance to execute their concept, and must fill 90 minutes even if the show is tanking. While this may seem like a list of all the reasons that SNL is bad — after all it means that jokes won’t land, performers will mess up their lines, and prosthetic horns fall off — but this is also the reason why SNL can still be exciting. As a uniquely scrappy, accident-prone production, SNL is the last of its kind in a world where low-stakes, highly polished comedy prevails. Where else can we watch Kim Kardashian’s eyes follow her ex-husband Kanye West leaving the audience mid-monologue or hear Elon Musk’s awful Italian accent while he tries to play Wario?
Being the last of its kind is not reason enough for SNL to keep running, but it’s a good reason for the show to continue trying. And, in the past few seasons, SNL has been trying, adding cast members that break up the old boys club that has defined the show, and it has found some success. Newer cast members have chipped away at the show’s stodgy format ever so slightly, and it has been the highlight of the past few seasons. Bowen Yang’s nonhuman characters like the iceberg that sank the Titanic or the lanternfly have brought an absurdity that the show didn’t entertain in the past. Sarah Sherman’s body horror with her prosthetic eyes and roller coaster accident victim characters bring a visual creativity that SNL historically lacked. When Michael Che sabotages Colin Jost by writing him cancel-worthy lines, it’s equally funny and satisfying to see Jost squirm. Even for those that have traded TVs for smaller screens, the SZA-assisted song “Big Boys” became a hit on TikTok.
The newer, more diverse cast gives SNL hope, but the show will need to keep breaking its canned format if it wants to remain relevant. Time will tell if the show is on its deathbed or simply having a midlife crisis, but if SNL wants to see its 50s, it’s going to have to be less risk-averse. By opening its 48th season with football, SNL showed that it’s still trying to appeal to a mass audience that may have already abandoned them. If SNL stops aiming for mass appeal and leans into the wackiness, technical foibles, and ambitious but niche and clumsy humor that has spotted it with charm for the past 48 seasons, it will show that live comedy is still exciting. SNL can still be funny, but first, they have to be in on the joke.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the comic book market surged. Major events like Superman’s “death” and the X-Men relaunch became cultural touchstones as publishers — notably the “Big Two” (DC and Marvel) — endorsed bombastic, interconnected narratives and marketing campaigns to match. With foil, die-cut, and embossed covers flooding newsstands, publishers printed millions of comic books per month. Superheroes were a commodity — a darling of prospective investors and pop culture gurus alike. In search of a greater share of a booming industry, many companies glutted the market with premiere issues and (often disappointing) “cataclysmic” events. But these gimmicks, which had once worked exceedingly well, no longer compelled the jaded masses. Soon enough, everything came toppling down.
This crazed trajectory, culminating in the Comic Book Crash of 1993, closely mirrors a current takeover of the cultural zeitgeist: the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
Marvel movies have taken unprecedented control of the box office, accounting for eight of the 25 highest grossing films of all time (seven of which came out in the last decade). This chokehold, however, has shown signs of loosening. Pre-pandemic, five of the last six Marvel movies grossed over one billion dollars, while only one of seven have achieved the same feat since the re-opening of theaters. Though this figure is partially attributable to a diminishing cinema-going public, it is likely that superhero fatigue and oversaturation are largely to blame.
Like comic book companies of the early 1990s, the MCU has fallen back on fan service and superfluous gimmicks to get audiences into theaters. In particular, “Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness” introduced Mr. Fantastic (John Krasinski), Professor X (Sir Patrick Stewart), and an array of fan-favorite characters as the short-lived Illuminati. Upcoming films, including “Deadpool 3” are being made in the same vein. Disney Plus content, notably “WandaVision,” “Werewolf by Night,” and “The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special,” are firmly rooted in pastiches of pre-established film and TV genres. In each of these cases, the MCU bastardizes its legacy characters and exacerbates an ongoing superhero fatigue.
Is this to say that nostalgia shouldn’t play a role in superhero movies? Not at all. Superhero movies, after all, are based on their staple-bound, 32-page forebears. They’re silly, fun, serialized nostalgia goodness — comfort food, if you will. Marvel movies are meant to be exhilarating cinematic romps with friends old and new — be it Peter Parker, Stephen Strange, or Kamala Khan. Nostalgia puts people in the seats.
But narrative — not nostalgia — keeps people in the seats. Recently, Marvel has forgotten how to experiment. Marvel seems unable to imagine and produce a movie of the caliber of the original “Iron-Man.” While occasional glimpses of the old Marvel are present in the new, those glimpses are becoming few and far between. “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” for example, crafted a heartfelt (though at times shaky) narrative about personal growth and hardship. Each of the three Spider-Man iterations earned their place in the story, contributing to complex character development in themselves and one another. Narrative, in this case, dictated nostalgia and the movie largely succeeded.
To say Marvel movies are dead would be an overstatement. To say, at their current rate, that Marvel movies are dying, would not.
When it first arrived on the scene, the MCU delivered something that had never been done before: an interconnected grouping of quality-driven movies with quality-driven characters played by quality-driven actors. The premise was simple and the execution was complex, engaging, and unilaterally successful.
Marvel’s Phase Four content, which mostly serves as a reaction to “Avengers: Endgame,” has lost sight of these standards. Current visual effects, such as those in “Thor: Love and Thunder” and “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” are slipping in quality. Phase Four Marvel stars like Angelina Jolie, Owen Wilson, and Oscar Isaac fail to uphold the same custodianship, reverence for, and embodiment of the Marvel canon as their antecedents.
Until Marvel can find a way to consistently establish new characters that rival Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron-Man and Chris Evans’ Captain America, new visuals that rival “Doctor Strange” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” new plotlines that rival “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Endgame,” the fandom will continue to wane and shift toward newer, better things. Nostalgia-dominant, multiversal movies, like gimmick-ridden comic books, can only last so long. Marvel movies “seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies as I’ve known and loved them,” asserted director Martin Scorsese in an opinion piece for The New York Times. The new rides in a theme park, as he famously put it, will always be compared to the old ones. And without experimentation and innovation, the MCU is doomed to fail as its source material did so many years ago.

Emma Chamberlain, sporting a dark shag haircut and colorful, preppy yet groovy garb, sits on the counter of a mid-century style kitchen. She is accompanied by her boyfriend Role Model, aka Tucker Pillsbury, who wears similar styles and cracks an egg into a pan from a dangerously high height.
This is how the couple appeared in GQ’s Valentine’s Day article, “This is Emma Chamberlain and Role Model’s Hard Launch.” The photos present a series of dichotomies — they are simultaneously authentically vintage and intensely modern; childishly playful and deeply mature; stylized and editorial yet candid in their display of the couple’s dynamic. They feature bright colors, a mid-century modern setting and stylistic elements of the ’60s and ’70s, yet still capture Gen Z stylistic influences with their distinct androgyny and uniquity.
This same sense of cultural relevance is echoed in the inherent discourse of the accompanying article that discusses the "soft launch” phenomenon, or the nonchalant posting of one’s significant other as a means of announcing a relationship often characterized by posts that maintain a significant other’s anonymity.
The GQ piece demands one’s attention, but what about it is so compelling?
Thanks to social media, anyone can be a public figure; cultivating a personal brand is no longer an act reserved for celebrities. Throughout the years, a variety of aesthetic social media trends have taken hold. However, nowadays the “coolest” young influencers are embodying relaxed public personas characterized by effortless beauty and understated presentations of luxury.
Although the occasional red carpet photo or magazine cover remain staples in the celebrity Instagram hand book, the posts of trend-setting young people like Olivia Rodrigo, Timothée Chalamet, and Victoria Paris largely demonstrate an aesthetic turn away from traditional “flex culture.” Influencers once promoted their lives with hyper-posed photos depicting inordinate amounts of wealth; however, the new genre of post is characterized by “low effort” glimpses into everyday life, candid photography, and snippets of art one enjoys, a genre dubbed as “casual posting.”
The soft launch is a key component of this tonal shift — an extension of this carefree attitude, applied to the romantic entanglements of Gen Z. Gen Z-exclusive terms such as “situationship,” “talking stage,” and “soft launch” were recently and accurately highlighted by Tik Toker @_asthecrowflies_ to minimize the significance of romantic relationships. The popularization of this lingo serves as a romantic accompaniment to this laissez-faire, “too-cool-to-care” presentation that many young people, ironically, work tirelessly to portray online.
The grander philosophy of this internet presence was spearheaded by Emma Chamberlain. Although Chamberlain rose to prominence on Youtube in the late 2010s, in recent years she has become known for her collaborations with major fashion brands, her start-up coffee company, and revamped vlog style. Her more recent video content romanticizes the mundane and echoes the sentiments of the carefree attitude that the soft launch epitomizes.
In a world where everyone is constantly posting about everything all the time, the idea of a popular influencer being in a secret relationship feels novel and fascinating. Over the past couple of years, Chamberlain and Pillsbury have capitalized on this fascination, holding sacred their egregiously anonymous presentations of each other to the public. Despite the calculated and purposeful effect of many of their soft launch posts, the GQ article and its accompanying photoshoot subvert the idea that their relationship was a calculated stunt.
Regardless of the editorial nature inherent to a magazine shoot, photographer Zamar Velez astutely captures the candid energy for which Chamberlain and Pillsbury are famous. The fashion showcased in these images feels unapologetically genuine to both, encapsulating their respective playful yet down-to-earth attitudes and styles. Each outfit shines in its own right, yet is complemented and enhanced by the pieces worn by their counterpart.
Writer Eileen Cartter highlights the premise of the shoot as the two “playing house” early on in the article, a theme which is clearly portrayed in the posing of the creatives. Each image feels as though the viewer were peeking into an intimately candid moment between the pair, and some of the photos are legitimate candids of the couple simply fooling around. This casual attitude should feel out of place in this editorial context; however, it serves to enhance the art by demonstrating their individuality and ingenuity.
In other images, the couple stares into the camera knowingly, confronting the existence of onlookers. Here, Chamberlain and Pillsbury actively break the fourth wall between celebrity and viewer, challenging the parasocial context in which the public exclusively perceives.
By emphasizing authenticity in their announcement photos, the pair subverts the typical celebrity-couple announcement. This subversion is thematically consistent with their subversion of their own soft launch. The couple’s rejection of the soft launch trend as it has come to be, as manifested in this “hard launch,” indicates a rejection of the pretension that the soft launch currently represents — highlighting their dedication to authenticity.
The cultural significance of this “hard launch” was not only instigated by months of private-but-not-secret posting from the pair, but also a rejection of the pressure of doing so. The symbolic nature of their announcement is enhanced by the artistic potency of its accompanying photography — a raw demonstration of the couple's cultural and artistic uniquity. It would not be surprising if the iconic effect of the announcement culminates in a new “hard launch” trend for relationships in the coming months that centers around carelessly declaring relationships as opposed to meticulously teasing them. Once again, Chamberlain and Role Model prove themselves as cultural and artistic juggernauts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Jaws” took the world by storm in June of 1975. Dubbed the first ever summer blockbuster, it ushered in an era of big budget, attention-grabbing cinema. The fruits of this "movie brat" movement were sometimes groundbreaking (e.g., “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones”), and other times yielded stale ideas and poor imitations (e.g., “Grizzly” and “Alligator”).
In 2023, the Hollywood blockbuster formula has instead shifted its focus toward well-known directors, well-known actors, and well-known franchises. If a movie has one, two, or all of the following, it is likely to be greenlit by a major studio. Elizabeth Banks’s “Cocaine Bear” defies this formula. It harkens back to the days of the “movie brats,” wherein ambitious directors like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas reigned over Hollywood.
While “Cocaine Bear” unsurprisingly does not carry the same emotional weight as a Spielberg narrative or the same visual flair as a Lucas film, it, like its predecessors, runs with what could be a one-note concept and transforms it into something wholly itself. In the case of “Cocaine Bear,” this means nonstop action propelled by zany characters and their outrageous encounters.
A rollicking adventure that never shies away from the absurdity of its source material, “Cocaine Bear” follows the story of a deranged bear high off its mind on millions of dollars’ worth of cocaine. And while that might not seem like enough to ground an hour and a half feature film, it does. Indeed, as soon as the trailers end and the title cards disappear, “Cocaine Bear” finds its footing.
The opening scene depicts Andrew C. Thornton II, a coked-out drug smuggler, aboard a crashing airplane. Strapped with a heavy load of prepackaged cocaine, he faints immediately after hitting his head on the plane’s hatch. Thornton and the cocaine, barreling to the ground, are left to fate, which comes in the form of a four hundred pound, man-eating carnivore.
This type of absurdist, irreverent comedy favorably carries throughout the movie. Each character is a caricature of some sort, ranging from compassionate tough guys to a lustful old lady and her object of desire. Even the late Ray Liotta, famous for his stint as mobster Henry Hill in “Goodfellas,” plays an exaggerated drug kingpin held accountable for the lost cocaine. Through these ridiculous characters, the movie finds a few laughs, especially through little Henry’s vulgarities, detective Bob’s foofoo puppy, and Ranger Liz’s thirst for Peter.
Where “Cocaine Bear” most shines, though, beyond its hyperbolized characterizations and over-the-top dialogue, is its comedy-horror. Unlike “Jaws,” which opted for tension and drama over grand scale shark encounters, “Cocaine Bear” makes frequent and unserious use of its titular character. Any sequence with cocaine, the bear, or both are instantly gripping and hilarious.
But most of all, “Cocaine Bear” is extremely violent, its humor deriving from a slapstick horror reminiscent of cult classics like “Evil Dead” and the recently popular “Terrifier” franchise. In a variety of always escalating, always creative sequences, the characters of “Cocaine Bear” undergo absurd injury after injury. These visual gags are made all the more outrageous by the painstaking attention to detail paid to the movie’s special effects.
One of the biggest and most remarkable jokes of “Cocaine Bear” may be its hyper-realistic rendering thereof. At no time in the movie does one feel taken away from the story as a result of lackluster digital effects. That which should be totally fictional, a “cocaine bear,” appears on camera as convincingly as any wild bear would, which only contributes to the insanity of the movie’s premise and effective execution.
“Cocaine Bear,” though, climaxes too soon. Its best scene, involving Ranger Liz and the local ambulance, occurs midway through the movie. Chock-full of shocking and hilarious moments, this scene and its buildup are worth the price of admission alone.
Except, the rising action and climax pale when compared to the elaborate ambulance gore fest. In any other movie, this might not be as considerable an issue. But in “Cocaine Bear,” in which complex characters are shelved for static archetypes and the main attraction is the “cocaine bear” itself, the action should escalate from start to finish.
The ambulance scene undercuts this escalation. The movie’s central plot device peaks too soon and the slapstick horror subsequently falters.
While it has its shortcomings, “Cocaine Bear” ultimately delivers on its uncomplicated promise in a way that is compelling, laugh-inducing, and original. If not the second coming of “Jaws,” “Cocaine Bear” is still an important (albeit absurdist) step for the film industry, a sign of more ridiculous, fun-filled blockbusters to come.
And if rumors are to be believed, a “Cocaine Shark” movie could be just on the horizon.

Perhaps “playground” isn’t the first word that comes to mind when thinking of the Loeb Experimental Theater, but that is what the cast and crew of the musical “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown” aim for the audience to experience when they see their performance in the space. Featuring the characters from the comic strip “Peanuts,” with music and lyrics by Clark Gesner, book by John Gordon, and a revision by Andrew Lippa in 1999, the musical follows the antics of the familiar gang as they navigate the treacherous world of growing up. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production, directed by Nikhil O. Kamat ’25, runs from March 2 to March 4 at the Loeb Ex.
For Kamat, the musical isn’t just about a snippet of childhood, but also about connecting to themes that the college audience would still relate to.
“It evokes a lot of joy and happiness, and also kind of makes you reflect on times you were put in similar situations to these characters,” he said. “It’s really playing into that enjoyment and excitement that children have.”
The cast and crew are mindful of their college audience, and have accordingly taken a creative direction to help the musical connect to students venturing to the theater in search of a respite from schoolwork.
“We thought a lot about how to fit the show for a college audience and with college actors,” said Carolyn Y. Hao ’26, the choreographer. “And I think a lot of what we thought about was connecting to childhood and to just being young and being free.”
The musical is staged in an intimate black box theater with the audience seated on three sides of the performance space. The farther audience row is positioned mere feet away from the stage, which makes the production feel much more cozy than traditional musical productions. Matthew J. Given ’25 (“Snoopy”) relishes the opportunities that such a performance space brings.
“It’s a good acting challenge, being able to utilize the fact that everyone is crammed in so tight and watching your every move,” he said. “In some ways, you don’t have to be as big and gestural as you are on the mainstage.”
“We’ve definitely thought a lot about how to move the actors in a way and choreograph their movements, and figure out how to project to all sides of the theater,” Hao added.
This intimacy with the audience is something that the cast and crew of “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown” want to take advantage of to the fullest degree. Kamat finds the relationships between characters to be the driving force of the musical, which is rendered more powerful by the smaller performance space.
“What makes the show interesting for the audience is the connections and feelings they have towards the characters,” he said. “You get to feel like what’s happening is really and truly right in front of you.”
When talking to cast and crew, the buoyancy and creativity is palpable. The cast and crew have embraced the sense of play that their musical evokes, channeling that sense of joy and curiosity on and off stage.
“It’s a couple of kids that we can all relate to, in some way or another, going through life, enjoying its stresses and trials and tribulations, but coming out on the other side with a smile,” Given said.
Ultimately, though, “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown” is a production that just wants its audience to have fun.
“It’s a reminder to be more free, or to be more childish, once in a while,” Inseo Yeo ’26 said.
“What I’m really loving about this show is that it doesn’t pretend to be anything more than it is,” Given said.
For college students exhausted from the onslaught of midterms and non-stop campus life, “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown” may be a crucially needed, relatable, and enjoyable escape.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 13 years old, I went to my first drag show. My mom took me and my younger siblings, 11 and nine, to a local bar to see the queens of Tampa, Florida lip sync and dance. It was unforgettable. The last queen that evening, Adriana Sparkle, had long, curly purple hair, an unbelievably sparkly pink jumper, a furry pink coat, and a full grown beard. She was gorgeous. She lip synced “Money” by Leikeli47 while sashaying and twirling around the bar.
Adriana sang to “Attitude,” snapping her fingers in front of her face.
13-year-old me was enchanted, possibly inspired. What a great way to live life: with confidence, a bit of an attitude, and a fabulous style.
Last year, a video of a child at a drag show in Florida provoked outrage among Republican legislators. As a result, Governor Ron DeSantis threatened to alert child protective services to evaluate parents who take their children to drag shows, which he called “child endangerment.”
Meanwhile, school shootings run rampant in Florida — with an average of 185 child deaths a year attributed to gun violence, and GOP legislators refuse to pass comprehensive legislation addressing the issue.
The attack on drag is just one of many GOP red herrings that divert attention away from issues that actually harm people.
Florida and other conservative-led states are increasingly targeting art forms and education discussing BGLTQ and Black culture — forcing teachers to hide or remove books from their classroom libraries, censoring A.P. African-American History, banning the discussion of gender identity in classrooms, and barring transgender athletes in public schools from playing on athletic teams consistent with their gender.
It's clear that many members of the GOP would prefer to live in a white, heterosexual, cisgender, homogeneous world. They do not value diversity. Thus, they hold no appreciation for art that comes out of decades or centuries of struggles against oppression.
Drag queens are used to being judged and marginalized, but they still remain themselves. Drag queens teach us the importance of self-expression despite the societal push to shame those who are different, and they show us that we can be whoever we want to be.
Based on his views, DeSantis would not consider this type of empowerment a positive influence. Before he signed the “Don’t Say Gay” law, DeSantis said in a press conference that it is “inappropriate” to teach kindergarten-aged kids that “they can be whatever they want to be.”
But biological men dressing like women is not new. Cross-dressing dates back to the first theatrical performances in ancient Greece. Men cross-dressed in every female role until the 17th century with the rise of opera. Women then began to play men as well, especially in roles of young boys, leading to theatrical traditions like a woman playing Peter Pan in the musical of the same name. As theater and performance developed, drag continued to be a way to create something fresh, exciting or comical.
It's a natural form of performance and expression.
On top of this, in many ways, drag is art. Drag performers in preparation spend hours doing precise makeup to create characters. They often wear beautiful, colorful, extravagant clothing. They select music and choreograph dances and break the boundaries of social norms. Of course drag gains an audience — it's amazing to see people not only free and comfortable with themselves, but also impressively multi-talented.
A few years after my first drag show, I had the opportunity to hire Adriana Sparkle to work a music festival. As we walked around the festival to take pictures with fans, we came to the topic of DeSantis’s anti-drag bill. Adriana told me she doesn’t want kids coming to her shows — she doesnt stop parents who bring them — but her shows aren't designed for kids. Still, she said, it's humiliating for a law to deem them dangerous or threats to children in any way, or to assume that drag is intrinsically sexual.
The Catholic Church is fraught with centuries of sexual abuse, Adriana pointed out, but kids aren’t banned from there.
It's clear that these new bills are targeting drag’s connection to the BGLTQ community and promoting stereotypes. These new laws restrict liberty and freedom, the very ideals that conservatives claim to support and expand. This phenomenon is just another part of the large censorship trend surging across the right-wing United States. Conservative governors like DeSantis claim to give parents more freedom to control what their kids hear and experience at school. But at this point it's just hateful, attempting to push heteronormativity and ostracize the already ostracized.
To me, it's a last breath of air for conservatives looking to silence marginalized people. The invention of the internet exposes children to all that exists in the world, and it's nearly impossible to control what a child may see online. But shouldn’t children be able to learn about the world in a real way, instead of being shielded until they inevitably find out about it in an uncontrollable way online?
Ultimately, the experience of watching drag and interacting with drag queens is good for children. The creativity brings joy to performers and to audiences of all ages. It taught me tolerance and empathy. It showed me the value of experiencing, enjoying and celebrating differences. Florida children deserve drag.

On Feb. 18, Puffin Books announced they would be republishing new editions of Roald Dahl’s books. This is not a surprise: His books have long been famous and influential, with many children growing up reading him, and their relevance continues today — in fact, a new film adaptation of the musical based on his beloved children’s novel “Matilda” was released in cinemas last December. However, these new editions come with a surprising change: The content of Dahl’s books has been edited for inclusion and sensitivity.
In some ways, this could be considered a welcome change. Dahl frequently mocked the physical characteristics of his characters, particularly women, in his novels. Some of the new edits shift away from this reductive language, instead criticizing the behavior and actions of these characters. This included changing the description of Augustus Gloop in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” from “fat” to “enormous” and replacing the word “female” in “Matilda” to “woman.” Although there is merit to the idea of phasing out reductive language in books being published today, many have opposed this choice, including British PM Rishi Sunak and author Salman Rushdie, who called it “absurd censorship.”
Puffin has defended this decision, saying that they have a responsibility towards young readers, especially when these novels could be some of the first they ever read. Although approximately 100 changes spread across at least a dozen books may not appear to be that concerning, they raise the question of why these edits were even necessary. This debate is reminiscent of the backlash a 2011 republishing of Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” received, in which two racist pejoratives, including the n-word, were removed. Though this sparked discourse about the anti-racist work Twain was attempting to do despite using that slur, and the modern value of this choice, the changes made to Dahl’s work seem incidental in comparison. However, these edits could be in response to deeper issues in Dahl’s novels as they implicitly reference other problematic elements about Dahl’s writing.
Dahl was famously antisemitic during his life, saying that he had “become antisemitic” in a 1990 interview and making comments such as, “There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity.” His antisemitism is perhaps most obvious in “The Witches,” a novel about a group of witches who prey on children and try to control the world’s economy through a global conspiracy, all of whom wear wigs and have large noses, and whose physical differences from humans can be spotted if watched closely. His estate made an apology for the hurt caused by his attitudes and comments in 2020; however, the content of this apology was pretty lukewarm.
The apology read: “Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl’s stories, which have positively impacted young people for generations.”
Several Jewish groups responded saying this was not good enough, with Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, saying, “This apology should have happened long ago [...] His abhorrent antisemitic prejudices were no secret and have tarnished his legacy.”
Roland Barthes’s concept of the “death of the author,” or the idea that the intention of an author should be irrelevant when considering their work, particularly applies to this discussion. When creators of art hold harmful and offensive attitudes, people are forced to wonder if they can ethically consume their media. Considering Dahl’s reprehensible views, and the platform these continued republishings bring to his work, this idea is very relevant. But unlike in many other contemporary examples, Dahl died in 1990 and is no longer alive to profit from his works, though his estate itself is alive and well.
It is therefore clear that remnants of some of his more harmful attitudes will still remain in his work, regardless of some in-line edits. Though it is certainly a positive to present children with wonderful literature that is also empowering and uplifting to all readers, it seems misguided to warp Roald Dahl’s novels in pursuit of that aim. There is definitely still value in reading Dahl — his children’s novels are notable for having darker and wackier themes than his contemporaries, and often provide uplifting if unconventional messages — but there would be more value in reading him critically, considering his biases, and helping young readers to think about the perspective of the stories they are being told, instead of haphazardly painting over potentially harmful comments about a character’s appearance.
In response to this backlash, Penguin has decided to also republish the original, unaltered versions of Dahl’s text alongside the updated versions. Though this is a reasonable compromise, it doesn’t make any clearer what the updated versions intended to achieve. It would be much more fruitful to put this kind of time and energy into publishing and republishing living authors, whose original incarnations of their novels are supportive and inclusive and uplifting to children. Trying to rewrite Dahl only has the potential to provide monetary benefits to a select few, and it fails to critically engage with his novels and his bigotry.

“Of an Age” is an Australian gay coming of age story from Director Goran Stolevski, only the second feature length film of his career. Set in the summer of 1999, the romance that unfolds between 18-year-old dancer Kol (Elias Anton) and his friend's older brother Adam (Thom Green) moves at a rapid yet beautiful pace, reminiscent of Luca Guadagino’s “Call Me by Your Name.” This experience is clearly transformative for both characters, yet incredibly fleeting, keeping members of the audience on the edge of their seats as they await the outcome of the relationship.
The beginning of the movie jumps right into a spirited — yet confusing — narrative. The audience is put into a state of befuddlement as they are forced to figure out the events of the movie from the perspective of the characters experiencing them. Ebony (Hattie Hook) wakes up lost on a beach, unsure of where she is because of an eventful, substance-filled night. In a state of panic, she calls her best friend and dance partner Kol to bail her out of the situation, because they both need to be at their final dance competition in just a few hours. However, Ebony soon discovers that she is over an hour away, and Kol has no access to a car. She racks her brain for anyone who would be available to help and begrudgingly sends Kol to come retrieve her with her older brother, Adam.
For audiences with any clue what they're getting into, it very quickly becomes clear that Adam and Kol have a good amount of chemistry between them, despite their contrasting walks of life. The characters exchange witty and humorous dialogue, discovering that their interests are much more aligned than they would have ever expected. As the rest of the night unfolds, the chemistry between these characters similarly continues to grow, resulting in moments of passion and surrealism that the audience will never forget.
Although “Of An Age” might initially feel like a semi-cliche gay coming of age story, this movie sets itself apart through a jump to the year 2010. In the second half of this film, the characters are reunited after a long separation by a chance airport run-in; they are both in town for Ebony's wedding. What then transpires feels like a chaotic fever dream, as the later half of the movie all takes place in one day, detailing the events of Ebony’s wedding, and the state of the lover’s relationship after a nearly 15-year hiatus, as well as establishing how each of these characters’ lives will move forward from yet another fateful day.
While this movie stands out for a compelling yet not groundbreakingly original narrative, it is also visually distinct. The first half of the movie noticeably utilizes a square frame to demarcate the earlier time period. The majority of the film’s screen time is spent with dialogues between the lovers in a car, allowing the film to take advantage of zoomed-in shots that allow viewers to pay full attention to each of the characters’ facial expressions and reactions. There are also clear tonal shifts based on the setting, as the nighttime allows characters to reveal their true selves under the guise of darkness. Ultimately, the film takes advantage of visual queues and alterations to make for a unique viewing experience.
In addition, the soundtrack of this movie deserves to be mentioned for its ranging genres and emphasis on foreign songs. Whether the music playing is serving to help the characters in the film find common interests and develop their relationships, or just helping to make the atmosphere and mood of the film more intimate, it is impossible not to notice its presence. For example, as the characters bond over a box of cassettes in one of their many car rides home, they introduce each other to new music, further revealing parts of their own individual worlds to each other.
The film has the power to be particularly touching to audiences due to the relationship between these lovers being inevitably forbidden by circumstances that continue to separate them. It leaves audiences with a bittersweet feeling in their hearts as they come to accept the fact that these lovers will not have a happy ending. This, tied together with the way that the movie non-narratively conveys emotion purely through the atmosphere that it creates, results in a beautiful joyride. Something beautiful yet fleeting — that despite our best attempts to hold onto it forever, will always be just out of reach.

Words are the way a person communicates with the world. But what if words aren’t available? What if the language isn’t there, or what if the words are floating just out of reach?
In his poignant memoir, “Life On Delay,” John Hendrickson invites the reader to understand his own relationship with words — the ones he says and the ones he doesn’t. A lifelong stutterer, Hendrickson uses “Life On Delay” to communicate the immense impact of spoken word.
Hendrickson harnesses words every day as a staff writer at The Atlantic. After publishing a 2019 article discussing Joe Biden’s stutter, he was offered the chance to speak on MSNBC. He took it.
“You’d like to think that when these moments arise you stride toward them – chin up, chest out, triumphant horns blaring somewhere in the background,” Henderson writes of the experience. “Right now I’m just scared.”
He had spent his whole life avoiding public speaking and was suddenly thrust into the limelight. Yet, he chose to be interviewed not just this once, but multiple times on national television. While his story may initially draw readers due to its Biden connection, Hendrickson’s tale is strong enough to stand on its own.
In addition to the professional opportunities provided by the article’s success, Hendrickson’s article also sparked an outpouring of letters from fellow people who stutter. Hendrickson writes that for the first time in his life, he felt like a part of a community. As a result of the story’s popularity, Hendrickson embarked on a voyage through his own past, slowly piecing together his own relationship with stuttering from his diagnosis as a kindergartner up to the present day. In his memoir, Hendrickson talks to old teachers, girlfriends, college buddies, and bosses – those who had seen his stuttering first hand. Most importantly, he dives into his relationships with his parents and older brother; his tumultuous relationship with his family threads throughout the novel, haunting him long after both he and his brother leave the confines of their home.
As Hendrickson interviews those from his past, he weaves his personal experiences with current research on stuttering as well as the experiences of both private and public figures who struggle with stuttering. At times the patchwork of lives throughout the work felt random, cutting from one story to the next. But in other moments, the stories bled into each other, reminding the reader of the commonality of the human experience and encouraging greater compassion for all. His journalistic tendencies shine through as he reports on what others have learned.
This memoir revolves around others' and society’s responses to those that have a stutter. Hendrickson describes the painful, physical reactions that others have – pulling their head back, looking away, wincing — when watching him stutter:
“It’s primal, this reaction: another body literally retreating from you, the problem,” he writes.
But this is not just a book about stuttering. Even though the novel focuses on stuttering, the book highlights the common challenge of struggling to communicate with those around you. Whether it’s struggling to communicate in a new language or suffering from a disease that impedes speech, readers of many communities can relate to Hendrickson’s experiences. And at the end of the day, Hendrickson can find peace with his past and his stutter, providing inspiration for readers to find peace with their own challenges, too.

Considering it’s a show about a serial killer’s boundless obsession with romance, “You” practically begs for the inclusion of intimate scenes, and while not completely void of them, season four represents a significant shift in what the show aims to represent.
Penn Badgley, the lead actor in the series, speaks about his aversion to sex scenes and the process he undertook to remove them slowly from the spotlight of “You” in an interview with Variety Magazine. There are several reasons why he advocates for this shift — in both number and importance — of these scenes. He describes concerns about the “fidelity in [his] relationship,” his age in respect to his co-stars, and also how televised intimacy “has always been disturbing” to him, as reasons for this new perspective. Also during the interview, he specifically states that he has never wanted to affiliate himself “at all” with what he calls “that mercurial boundary” but has unfortunately found himself in the middle of it since the beginning of his career.
One of his first roles, at age 12, was in “The Fluffer,” where he plays a younger version of Michael Cunio’s character, Sean. Yes, 12-year-old Badgley placed adjacent to the job of keeping male pornography actors aroused. He says this — the accelerated aging of children in the industry and in the audience — is “the microcosm of the whole thing!”
Let’s take the raunchy TV series “Euphoria” as an example. Though they play highschoolers, the average cast member, the exception being 19-year-old Storm Reid, is above the age of 24, with the oldest member, Alexa Demie, being 32. Hollywood would not even dream of having real, underaged teenagers play high schoolers on television, and that says something about the content that is being produced. It is a problem that sex is so prominent in popular media today. This prevalence is the fault of creators, of course, but also the people that choose to give it a platform.
Even more convincing, and unfortunate is the fact that Badgley is far from the only star to experience this discomfort. In an interview she did with W Magazine in 2017, Nicole Kidman spoke up about her sex scenes in “Big Little Lies,” claiming that she felt “very exposed and vulnerable and deeply humiliated at times.” She recalls the experience: “I was just lying there, sort of broken and crying, and I remember at one point Jean-Marc coming over and just sort of placing a towel over me because I was just lying there in half-torn underwear and just basically on the ground with nothing on and I was just, like [gasps].” Yet, she still felt as though she had to push through for the sake of the show. It is horrifying that this mode of practice was considered permissible.
An important aspect of this conversation is the obvious, yet often overlooked, fact that actors are human beings. They have lives and feelings outside of their work, despite the industry’s dedication to ignoring that. Charlie Hunnam, also an actor in a relationship, had communicated his hatred for sex scenes around the same time Kidman expressed her discomfort. His main reason was also because of his relationship, and the fact that fans would harass him and insult his girlfriend after scenes were released. More recently, in 2021, Keira Knightley vocalized her commitment to stop doing sex scenes directed by men, due to the exploitative nature of the male gaze. Whether it be related to an added strain on a relationship, or because of one’s personal image and wellbeing, a multitude of actors have spoken up about the negative impact of sex scenes on their personal lives.
Though actors do generally agree to do these scenes ahead of time, new actors and actors that have become associated with their sex scenes often feel as though they cannot turn down a role even though they’re uncomfortable. No one should be subjected to doing something they don’t want to, and furthermore, very publicly deal with the repercussions. With actors, this additional burden of publicity is an even bigger issue — all eyes are on them, always. Sex scenes can lead to online and physical harassment, and invasive interviews, and repetitive, revealing tabloids.
Penn Badgley’s sex scenes in “You” are especially significant because of his fanbase, and even more importantly, the character he plays. Joe Goldberg is a serial killer, and the sex scenes in earlier seasons contributed to a dangerous romanticization of this vile character. Fans of “You,” along with fans of other shows like “Dahmer” and “Dexter,” often forget that the actions of these murderers should not be excused or justified. No amount of beauty or wrongfully-placed admiration should mask the evilness of the deeds portrayed on screen, but to some degree, the sex scenes in “You” did exactly that. Instead of Joe Goldberg, the murderous stalker, it was Joe Goldberg, the passionate and obsessively loyal lover. Sex scenes helped make him more admirable, more human, when really he was committing terribly inhuman crimes. Now, that season four features fewer sex scenes — all of which are fully clothed — there is less opportunity for this romanticization.
This change is a positive move for actor autonomy, boundaries, and the role of sex scenes in TV. This decision to cut back on the sex scenes refocuses the show, could help reduce the concerning idolization of serial killers, but most importantly, it makes Badgley more comfortable, and more eager to continue acting. And actors should feel comfortable coming to work and doing their job, just like any other workplace.

Director Jonah Feingold attempts to bring his vision of a heartwarming meet-cute to life in his second romantic comedy film “At Midnight,” but fails to establish his own narrative and style as he structures the film after many other well-known romcoms. Heavily drawing inspiration from the plot of “Notting Hill,” the leading couple follows the boy-meets-stunning-actress trope, where she finds a sense of a normal life with him. They keep their relationship a secret from the public eye, but this fantasy-like romance quickly becomes a reality as they fall deeply for each other. As she is about to wrap up filming, they are faced with the difficult decision of fighting for something real, or moving on with their separate lives and dreams.
Feingold presents a whirlwind romance between a hotel employee (Diego Boneta), and a famous Hollywood actress (Monica Barbaro). Throughout the film, the storyline seems to point at the important topic of the unequal treatment between male and female actresses and gives way to feminist themes. Unfortunately, Feingold tackles this inefficiently and the potential for an exploration of powerful themes fall through by the end of the film, as he never addresses them, and instead closes with a happy ever after.
The feminist themes are first portrayed at the start of the film, when Sophie Wilder (Monica Barbaro) and Adam Clark’s (Anders Holm) relationship starts to unravel after he cheats on her. As Hollywood’s it couple, Sophie is forced to keep dating him. As she struggles with the desire to stand up for herself and other women in the industry, she is haunted by the question: “Do you really want to be treated like just another Jen?” In referencing Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Aniston, and particularly their failed relationships, the director highlights how actresses tend to get the short end of the stick in situations like this. They are discouraged from speaking out so that their image can be upheld and so they will be taken seriously by casting directors. Sadly, Feingold seems to ignore the issue as Sophie listens to her agent and never publicly breaks up with Adam. The film’s focus moves away from this topic and it is never brought up again, thereby silencing Sophie.
However, the film does a fantastic job of revealing the beauty of Mexico and its culture, as most of the film is set in a luxury beach hotel where the couple meets. The vibrant streets of Mexico City are shown during the scenes where Sophie and Alejandro escape their stress-filled lives to dance and explore.
The rom-com provides a meaningful representation of Latinx culture and diversity among the cast members. The dialogue shifts between characters speaking in Spanish and English, particularly in Alejandro’s conversations with his friends and family, or when he mumbles to himself. This contributes to the comedic aspect of the film, as he swears in Spanish and Sophie cannot understand him. At first he would mumble under his breath sarcastic comments towards her, but as time went on they would banter and she would try her best to engage with him. For the viewers who speak Spanish, his swearing serves as an inside joke and creates a sense of comfort but most importantly, the Spanish dialogue and the scene where Alejandro brings Sophie home to meet his parents, creates a warm and familiar atmosphere for viewers who can resonate with the Latinx traditions and characters.
Similarly, the heartwarming interactions between Alejandro’s family members enriched the film. As the family sat around the dinner table listening to his abuela’s stories and gossiping in the kitchen, the film immersed each viewer into the scene, making it seem like the audience was at the dinner themselves. The heartwarming scenes emphasize the importance of “la familia” in Latinx cultures reflect how moments of gathering and food are a staple that brings everyone together no matter where they are.
Furthermore, the chemistry between Sophie and Alejandro is palpable from their first encounter. Viewers can tell from their prolonged eye contact and sweet smiles that they have found true love, even though Alejandro had a strict rule to only have one night stands with tourists. Those who view rom-coms religiously can pick up on Alejandro’s quick glances and feel butterflies when he grabs Sophie’s wrist as she turns to leave. The film even puts a spin on a reference to “Notting Hill” for those who are hopeless romantics. The iconic line “I am also just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her,” becomes “I am standing here in your outdoor kitchen, asking you: Do you have a late night menu?” a line that ties back to their first midnight rendezvous.
Avid viewers of rom-coms who enjoy the comfort of a timeless trope and those who are looking for Latinx representation, with a cast that is coincidentally both attractive and charming, will greatly enjoy this film. That being said, Feingold’s film is not for those who are expecting the next iconic couple and groundbreaking love story, as it is not likely to be the next blockbuster.

“Fairview,” the 2019 Pulitzer Prize winning drama by Jackie Sibblies Drury, challenges what it means to be a play, an actor, and an audience. But this work is not just an avant-garde experimentation in theater, it is a creative expression of the Black experience in white-dominated spaces and forthright critique of the white gaze.
Director Pascale Florestal brings “Fairview” to Boston with SpeakEasy Stage Company from Feb. 17 through Mar. 11. The production is provocative and pulls its audience into an uncomfortable but inescapable trance at the unpredictable acts that occur onstage.
What begins as a typical family drama in a living room set transforms into a meta-level deconstruction of a white perspective in real time. The opening act focuses on scenes of a Black middle-class family getting ready for their grandmother’s birthday dinner. This, however, is a diversion to the core of the play. In a mind-bending twist, white actors enter the fray, first as voices amplified over the house speakers, and then as characters — Black characters, played by white actors. The effect is outrageous and cringeworthy, but essential to the goals of the play.
Florestal emphasizes the eerie, everpresent white gaze in the play's staging. At the crux of the work when voices come to life, white bodies are seen at the outskirts of the set, peering through an open window, standing in an offset hallway, or peering through a poster dedicated to Harlem. Including the physical representations permits the white audience another chance to self-project, a crucial element of the play’s theme.
Maintaining the secrecy of the plot twist is essential to the play and made possible by convincing performances in the first act. Yewande Odetoyinbo, who plays Beverly, the mother in the family, anchors the first act. Her fluid navigation of stress and authority and overwhelming emotion is captivating and pushes the faux plot forward. Back and forth dialogue with Lyndsay Allyn Cox, who plays Beverly’s sister, Jasmine, captures the petty rivalry and loving interaction of family. Cox embodies Jasmine with the instantly recognizable sarcastic tone of a sarcastic younger sister. Her self-obsessive gestures — fixing her hair or checking herself out — win the audience’s laughter as well.
The unexpected and uneasy nature of the second act due to white actors portraying Black characters, however, imposes new meaning on the performances of the first. The play seemingly restarts, but instead of on-stage dialogue, audiences hear white actors questioning, “If you could be any race, what would you be?” amplified over the speakers. As they make uncomfortable, bigoted statements on race and color, the audience squirms at how relatable the conversation is. Meanwhile, they are forced to reevaluate the events of the first act without the dialogue. Cox’s dramatic physical expression is hardly as comical with the presence of white voices overhead. Perhaps that is the significance of Cox’s character pouring liquor into her wine in the second act, one of the few distinctions in events — the repetition and expression is exhausting, impossible to conquer without a little something to take the edge off.
While the significance of elements may vary from viewer to viewer, the underlying principle challenging the white perception is present from beginning to end. Sound designer James Cannon deserves much credit for this. Lizzo’s “Good As Hell” is the opening track played as Beverly peels the carrots in the first and second act. The moment of transition between on-stage and voiceover is a malfunction on the radio — instead of the studio recording of “Good As Hell,” an alternative rendition by unseen white instrumentalists plays without the bass. This subtle effect foreshadows the entire play in the auditory realm.
Victoria Omoregie’s character, Keisha, brings the high-concept, multidimensional, and overwhelming work back together in a monologue that sets the record straight, acknowledging the absurdity of what has exploded on stage and bringing the conversation off-stage, back to the audience. The recent Boston University graduate commands the room — literally. The final scene is interactive, calling all white audience members to take the actors’ place on stage. Omoregie’s on-stage performance brought in laughs, especially in her interactions with her aunt, Jasmine, but the final monologue is a stunning plea that ends the work with force.
It is impossible to watch “Fairview” without reflecting on one’s own experiences discussing race and color. Leaving the theater, SpeakEasy Stage Company provides an after-program list of questions to discuss the events of the play and offer further reading. It is hard to say that the shock-factor of the show carries the same weight it might have in 2018. Years after a global wave of Black Lives Matter protests and tone shift in media discussions of race, the 2023 audience context has likely undergone race reflections. Even so, as long as “Fairview” runs, it will give its audiences a mirror for self-reflection.

The end of an era: 19 seasons, 407 episodes, and tons of deaths later, “Grey’s Anatomy” upholds its legacy as the longest-running scripted prime-time show on ABC. The show has accumulated viewers spanning generations from Boomers to GenZ, and often brings contemporary issues to light. The characters have endured tragedy after tragedy, but there’s no saying whether the show will survive after its main character Meredith Grey’s (Ellen Pompeo) exit.
From plane crashes to drowning, Meredith has endured an ungodly amount of traumatic experiences. To commemorate Meredith’s exit in the season 19 midseason premiere, we’ve compiled a list of some of the best, and of course most traumatizing, “Grey’s Anatomy” episodes.
Spoilers incoming!
10. “Drowning on Dry Land” (Season 3, Episode 16)
This episode captures the essence of “Grey’s Anatomy.” Even as the interns are put to the test after a terrible ferry accident and Meredith toes the line between life and death, the relationships (both romantic and friendly) between characters remain at the forefront of the episode.
9. “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story” (Season 14, Episode 7)
The 300th episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” is a walk down memory lane. Scenes with the new interns parallel those from the early seasons and we are met with flashbacks and commemorations of all of the characters that have left the show. This episode is filled with full-circle moments which are a treat for long-time viewers.
8. “Fight the Power” (Season 17, Episode 5)
“Grey’s Anatomy” is known for tackling important issues throughout its episodes. This episode, set in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and rising racial tensions, confronts systemic racism with observations on the disproportionate number of Black or brown Covid patients. Viewers are also given a look into Miranda Bailey’s (Chandra Wilson) personal struggles with her mother’s sudden passing, and the heartfelt moment that she shares with Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) is priceless. The episode comes to a close with a voice-over honoring the memory of Covid-19 victims.
7. “Losing My Religion” (Season 2, Episode 27)
Denny Duquette Jr. (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) quickly became a favorite for viewers after his introduction in season 2, and his proposal to Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) gave the audience hope for a happily ever after. But as “Grey’s Anatomy” goes, there can’t be any happy endings when “Chasing Cars” starts playing. The episode hits us with two devastating deaths.
6. “Song Beneath the Song” (Season 7, Episode 18)
The musical episode that controversially split viewers into fans and critics is a must-watch. The show’s cast boasts several Broadway veterans and Tony award-winning actors, such as Sara Ramirez (playing Callie Torres), who shines in this episode. Filled with iconic “Grey’s Anatomy” anthems like “How to Save a Life,” “The Story,” and “Chasing Cars,” this episode starkly contrasts in tone with any other.
5. “A Hard Day’s Night” (Season 1, Episode 1)
No matter how many times you’ve seen it, the first episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” never fails to bring back feelings of excitement and anticipation for Meredith’s journey. We are introduced to the original interns: Meredith Grey, Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), George O’Malley (T. R. Knight) Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), as well as their resident and chief Miranda Bailey and Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), who viewers have grown to know and love.
4. “Now or Never” (Season 5, Episode 24)
Definitely one of the series’ saddest episodes, “Now or Never” delivers a gut-wrenching plot twist to viewers as an unrecognized patient, “John Doe,” is identified to be the beloved George O’Malley, “007.” This episode bids farewell to George and also delivers Izzie’s cancer diagnosis.
3. “Bring the Pain” (Season 2, Episode 5)
The episode is famous for the “Pick me. Choose me. Love me.” sound on TikTok where Meredith delivers the show’s most famous speech, begging Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to leave Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) for her. This episode also marks a significant turning point for Cristina Yang’s character.
2. “Who’s Zoomin’ Who?” (Season 1, Episode 9)
This episode delivered many memorable moments, such as George’s infamous syphilis diagnosis, Cristina’s unplanned pregnancy, and Richard’s tumor. And of course, one can’t forget Addison’s iconic introduction with the line, “And you must be the woman who’s been screwing my husband.”
1. “Sanctuary” and “Death and All His Friends” (Season 6, Episodes 23 and 24)
The two-part season finale takes viewers on an emotional rollercoaster. Starting with Meredith’s positive pregnancy test, the episode ends with a bang, quite literally. Grieving husband Gary Clark enters the hospital armed and seeking vengeance for his wife, who had died under the care of Derek. The viewers are brought along as the doctors scramble to protect their patients and struggle to ensure their own survival, as well as the survival of their fellow doctors. The characters are put to the test as Cristina operates on Derek at gunpoint while Meredith has a misscarriage, April Kepner (Sarah Drew) begs the shooter for her life, and Derek tries to reason with the shooter. In intensity and tragedy, this episode serves to illuminate how deftly these compelling characters and interpersonal relationships are built up.
Honorable Mention for Biggest Tearjerker: “How to Save a Life” (Season 11, Episode 21)
Derek dies. Need we say more?

The final three episodes of “Love is Blind” season three were released on Feb. 10, and like the previous seasons, this one is packed with tears, laughs, and the search for love. But unlike the previous ones, season three has no remnant of authenticity. “Love is Blind” has officially stopped marketing itself as trying to create genuine love stories. After the pods closed, we were left with five couples: Cole Barnett and Zanab Jaffrey, Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton, Nancy Rodriguez and Bartise Bowden, Sikiru “SK” Alagbada and Raven Ross, and Alexa Alfia-Lemieux and Brennon Lemieux.
Something that works well in this season is the drama! Though nothing will ever hold a candle to season one’s fraught beachside breakup between Diamond Jack and Carlton Morton, this season successfully provided enough controversy. Barnett and Jaffrey share an awkwardly silent argument on their first night together, and then constantly bicker about cleanliness, their bad attitudes, and whether or not Barnett believes Jaffrey is attractive. Reed and Bolton share a similar passion for petty remarks, spending the majority of their time being either passively or directly aggressive with each other — usually in front of other couples.
As for Rodriguez and Bowden— they were doomed from the start. In moments of conflict, she was too kind and too forgiving, while he was manipulative. Alagbada would’ve been the saving grace for the male species, had it not been for the vague yet intriguing monologue that Ross provided in Episode 15 after the couple broke off their engagement. Other than that, their relationship seemed weirdly adorable, despite them being such different people.
Everywhere you look in this season there is a rich, ironic, and totally unintentional comedy that finds its roots in the outlandishness of this season’s cast. From Bowden’s “I am going to pump a couple of kids in you” to Ross’s burning desire to do jumping jacks and yoga while someone is spilling their heart out, in addition to the deliciously convoluted games of telephone between Barnett, Jaffrey, Reed, and Bolton, viewers are really left wondering if there is such a thing as good communication, and by extension, any hope in a successful marriage.
The only argument against this is the chemistry between Alfia and Lemieux. If they had any drama, it was handled off camera. In Episode 14, Jaffrey describes Alfia and Lemieux as the season’s “trophy couple” and believes that “they are the example that the experiment works.” And she’s 100% right. Although, the underlying and unfortunate detail is that they are the only couple that proves this works. Does a 20% success rate really prove that the experiment achieves its aim?
Not at all. And that’s okay, considering that the only comfort viewers are looking for is the fact that their own lives could never get this messy.
With all the giggles and gasps caused by this season, it is very easy to forget that the show is purportedly about finding real love. Though there was only one couple that could be perceived as being in love — not in tolerance or in indifference — this connection continuously took a back seat to the dramatic experiences of other couples. Looking again to Episode 14, where there is a party being held for Alfia-Lemieux’s birthday, how much of it was actually dedicated to her? How much of it was rooted in petty, disingenuous conversations between all of the other couples? Again, no complaint here, drama is what everyone is looking for — but then, why try to pretend the show is about proving love is blind?
If none of that is evidence enough that the already lacking authenticity of this experiment has dwindled, the ending of the show must be. The last four minutes of the season finale are dedicated to an advertisement for Nick Lachey’s new dating show, “Perfect Match,” where contestants from other Netflix-based dating series are given yet another chance to find love — or more accurately, 15 minutes of fame and a paycheck. Despite the first season attempting to subvert the expectations of the classic reality TV formula, “Love is Blind” has clearly given up. It is no longer trying to be insightful or original or meaningful in any way, and frankly it’s about time.
In summary, the season was lovely to watch, but where season one attempts to differ from the norm, this is not even remotely good quality television. For viewers looking for laughs, and lots of drama, this is for you. But for those looking to restore your hope for romance, look anywhere else.

The “That ’70s Show” spinoff-turned-Netflix-show “That ’90s Show” reminds us to not take life too seriously, as we enter the life of teenager Leia Forman (Callie Haverda) whose sole concern is to have a memorable summer in 1995.
This gleeful sitcom follows Leia and her newly-formed, adventurous friend group, as she visits Wisconsin under the not-so-very-strict supervision of her grandparents for the summer.
From the opening scenes, it is made abundantly clear that the nature of this show will be humorous. However, one can clearly see how this overly emphasized comedy may either take away from the story or make it even more enjoyable for its viewers.
This is aptly illustrated by the characters that are featured during Leia’s once in a lifetime summer experience. These characters tend to strongly embody different high school stereotypes. Nate Runck (Maxwell Acee Donovan) is portrayed as a typical, fun-loving jock, who thinks of himself as an amazing boyfriend, but seems to push aside his girlfriend for his best friend, Jay. Runck is dating Nikki (Sam Morelos), an intellectual who seems to be a little too good for him considering her commitment to the relationship and ambitions, but she’s still convinced they belong together. Their dynamic parallels to a less toxic version of the stereotypical nerd and jock trope.
However, Nate and Nikki’s relationship is only scratching the surface of the teenage drama and complexities that the first season of the new Netflix show portrays. A major plot point of the season centers around Leia wanting to obtain her first kiss and an unexpected crush on Jay Kelso (Mace Coronel), who comes from a family of well known flirts, seeing his dad, Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) was also portrayed as a player in “That ’70s Show.” This results in a very predictable storyline featuring an awkward chemistry between Leia and Jay as the summer progresses. This dynamic is heart-warming and entertaining to watch at times, but lacks depth.
Leia’s summer would have not been complete without her grandparents, Kitty Foreman (Debra Jo Rupp) and Red Foreman (Kurtwood Smith). Between learning how to use a computer (which Red is extremely skeptical of) and catching Leia and her friends going to a rave, they never leave viewers without entertainment and are a highlight of the show.
Similarly, there were no major twists and turns in this season, leaving the viewer very little to ponder or become invested in. This may not be a negative thing depending on the mindset one has when viewing this creation depicting youth and their temporary life crises. If this is all the show intends to be, then that is completely adequate, if a bit disappointing.
The unserious nature of the show may remind viewers that although something seems like the end of the world in the moment, later on in life it will just be another laughable moment you vaguely remember from when you were young. “That ’90s Show’ could just be the perfect piece of media to watch when your midterms or life decisions are becoming overwhelming.
This is not to say the show does not touch on more important issues like the path to figuring out one’s true identity and accepting their sexuality, through the eyes of Ozzie (Reyn Doi), through illustrating the characters’ struggles and fears in doing so. While the characters introduced to us here tend to match neat stereotypes, they all experience very specific and different character development arcs as time goes on. Leia’s friend group slowly grows on viewers as their motivations and concerns about their life’s journey throughout her summer visit become clear
As for “That ’70s Show” appearances, the most frequent are glimpses of Eric Foreman (Topher Grace) and Donna Foreman (Laura Prepon) checking in, and trying to convince Leia that Wisconsin is not the place she wants to spend her summer.
Overall this show is ideal for viewers looking for a laugh and a hint of nostalgia, with enjoyable coming of age stories for multiple young adults, all wrapped up in one summer.

Reviving the Past: The Attic Brings 70s Fashion Back to Harvard Square
Apollonia Poilâne ’07 sat at the table in her office, a simple room with stacked books on the windowsills, clean white walls, simple furniture, simple art. A small dog slept nuzzled in a blanket on the couch. Light flooded in through the large glass windows. The room was bright, spacious, sparse.
“This is my family’s bakery, and we’ve been around since 1932,” said Poilâne in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Legacy. History. Institution.
All of these words come to mind when thinking of the famous bakery, an almost century-old Parisian institution of which Poilâne serves as the careful custodian. Three generations of family bakers labored to make the bakery what it is today, and Poilâne is quite aware of her role.
The boutique is small, unassuming, hidden, and it sits on the quiet Rue du Cherche-Midi, a small road near the bustling Boulevard Saint-Germain in the 6th arrondissement. Other than the roar of the occasional black taxi cab or a couple of motor bikes, Rue du Cherche-Midi is quiet; it’s a path for walkers, and, on this road, most people head to the same place.
With a brown-brick façade, flour-dusted wooden floors, and a large decorated loaf of their signature miche on display in the window, Poilâne Bakery has lived in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, a neighborhood once home to artists and writers, since before the Second World War. Now, Saint-Germain-des-Prés is a world-famous quarter of Paris, and Poilâne Bakery remains unchanged.
The boutique is comfortable, old, weathered. Despite being one of the most famous bakeries in the world, it feels fiercely local. Enter if you want, though you’ll take what it serves.
The inside is tight, crowded. On the right are the Poilâne-branded products that remind you of the size and fame of the bakery. A bread loaf-shaped throw cushion with a printed signature Poilâne “P” on the front, the linen Poilâne tea towels, bread knives, and Christine Ferber jams and preserves rest on the shelves.
On the left are the old wooden shelves with the precious loaves. The cashier asks you what you want and retrieves it for you. Other than the traditional miche, which is their rustic country loaf, they serve a classic pain de mie –– a sandwich bread baked in a tin –– a brioche, a rye, among other breads and patisseries.
With a half loaf of sliced miche wrapped quickly in brown paper, you are ushered out the door by the rest of the line; the two elderly women, the mother with the stroller, the people on their way home from work. All French. All waiting to get their daily serving.
The bread is spectacular.
Inheriting a legacy can be difficult, but it installs a sense of purpose, a sense of self. While many leaders in the food world seek to innovate, to evolve, Poilâne stands her ground. Treating her bakery as a shrine to the past, Poilâne only heightens the value of the bread she serves.
When the bakery opened almost a century ago, Poilâne’s grandfather, Pierre, refused to conform to the fashions of the time –– generally delicate white breads. Tasty, perhaps, but empty, hollow.
Proving loyal to the rustic country loaves that are still in production today, Pierre Poilâne gained favor among the artists of Saint Germain-des-Près who valued the lasting durability of the classic Poilâne miches.
Poilâne was the bakery in Paris. They made the rules. They set the boundaries. “My grandfather –– and my father thereafter –– essentially created what were the Poilâne certifications, so to speak,” she said.
As a testament to the history of the bakery, the same sourdough starter made first in 1932 by Pierre Poilâne is still in use today. That’s how sourdough works, that’s how sourdough lives on. A piece of dough from each batch is reserved for the next. Generations may come and go, but the sourdough lives, evolves, matures.
As Poilâne described, slight change is good; it makes the bread complex –– interesting –– which the bakers then have to complement and balance with each new batch, each new season, each new year. It’s all about nurturing that equilibrium and adapting to the bread’s flavor profile, to the bread’s anatomy.
Sourdough is important, and, yet, many bakeries do not emphasize its necessity. “Whenever you go to a baker –– and that’s just a good tip for any bread-curious person –– asking about the way the sourdough is made is important because now you can buy sourdough off of a catalogue, and it embodies very different shapes and forms,” Poilâne said.
Like its near-century-old sourdough, Poilâne Bakery is a living entity. While it may evolve, its essence will always remain the same — “It's that fine line between greeting the difference and having a sense of consistency.”
100-year-old sourdough. A bread oven from before the French Revolution.
Poilâne has been around for a long time.
Poilâne always knew her future would be in the bakehouse. “I was really groomed in some ways to take over my family’s business at some point; it just happened sooner than planned,” Poilâne said.
When she was eighteen years old, Poilâne lost her parents in a tragic helicopter accident. Instead of going down the stairs to the bakehouse, she went up and sat down in her father’s office. The flame passed to her. She was the new CEO of Poilâne.
“I grew up where my father worked at the bakery daily,” she said. “And so, you know, I was basically exposed from a very young age to this environment. And, so it came to me quite naturally that I would take over one day.”
To her, it was never in doubt: She would be a baker. Over time, however, Poilâne realized that her father’s job was not downstairs in the bakehouse, but in the office above. Nonetheless, anyone working at Poilâne had to not only know the fundamental aspects of their craft, but be masters of it.
Poilâne remembers what her mother told her at a young age: “Look, if you’re serious about taking over the family business at some point, you have to learn the craft. You have to learn the basics of the craft so that you can know what you’re talking about, but also so you can check if this is really your thing.”
With passion being the key word, Poilâne’s father also reinstated the need to believe in one’s work, to put it above all else, to be devoted to it above all else. “It’s great that you want to do this,” Poilâne’s father said to her one day. “But you have to be really passionate about your craft, because it is a tough craft at the end of the day.”
Poilâne’s parents made sure that their daughter knew the difficulty of the family business, and if it wasn’t for her, she didn’t have to do it; if she wanted to continue Poilâne’s long history, it had to be her choice. And she made her decision very easily.
“Baking was my calling,” she stated, simply.
“I really love how bread relates to just about anything –– I’ve never met a single person that bread has left indifferent.”
Bread is important to everyone in one way or another, but it’s also the building block upon which civilizations are built. “France has legislated profusely on bread because they’re just so scared of anything happening for lack of bread. And, if you look throughout history, everything: Every single revolution starts with a lack of bread,” Poilâne said.
Perhaps due to their justified insecurities, the French government restricted when Parisian bakeries could open and close, so at least one bakery stays open, in every neighborhood, at all times.
“Literally, until a few years ago, I used to receive a piece of paper –– an ugly, pink piece of paper — that would say ‘You can go on holiday in your neighborhood between this date and that date.’ We never close throughout the summer, so, that’s why it made me laugh, but, like, basically, if I wanted to go on holiday, it was that time! Pretty intense!”
As a Franco-American, Poilâne notes the differences between the bread culture in France and the United States, particularly with the discussion and understanding of different wheats, of different grains.
Poilâne said, “If you ask an average French person about corn, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, yeah, it’s animal feed.’ They’ll recognize that it is something that, like, really feeds you, but, they’re like, ‘it’s the underdog.’ And, oats. So, we have this vision of oats –– oatmeal –– and, in France, they have this vision of it being horse feed –– or stuff that’s just there to stuff you up. It’s fascinating.”
Perhaps without the centuries of strict tradition and rules, American bakers have a more innovative, inclusive, experimentative approach to bread and baking. In recent years, many locally-owned bakeries in the United States have been pushing the country’s bread culture forward.
“I think this has happened in the past 30-40 years, where there’s really been a rise in a new generation of bakers in the U.S. that –– funnily enough –– are now inspiring French bakers –– at least in some methodologies of baking,” Poilâne said.
While American bakeries may influence the French with new innovative techniques and methods, the French bakery has absolutely influenced its American counterpart. “If you look at the geography and the way bakers in America operate nowadays, I think they really have adapted the French model,” Poilâne noted.
With the French influence in mind, the famous Los Angeles-based La Brea Bakery paved the way for American bakers in the early 1990s. Led by founder Nancy Silverton, La Brea Bakery opened many Americans’ eyes to the wonder that is artisanal bread. While La Brea Bakery no longer leads the country’s bread culture, many other small-production bakeries have spawned in its wake: The small-town bakery has returned.
Flour. Water. Salt.
To Poilâne, bread is much more than simple nourishment — bread is the link that connects all civilizations. “What I realized is, when you talk about bread, it’s not only all of the links between bread and different domains of knowledge, but it’s also just the bread culture,” Poilâne said.
“Drop the word flour to generically mean ‘this very fine ground grain.’ Start talking about the grain — all-purpose flour doesn’t tell you much what it’s about. What kind of wheat is it? Or what kind of grain?”
Not that one can’t use the word flour, Poilâne quickly notes, but it is important to understand where bread comes from, what it is, why it’s important. All of Poilâne’s flours are from France, and each has its own character.
“One of the beauties of the French landscape is that we have just about any major grain that’s been sown around the world — we have an extraordinary diversity of geographies, and that’s actually one of the beauties of this country, is that you can go north, east, south, west and get very different landscapes in very little space,” Poilâne said.
Ukraine, along with Chicago, according to Poilâne, sets the world’s bread prices. “We really are at the mercy of those prices, even though France is a net-exporter of grain. So, like, we do not need Ukrainian grain in France, but it still defines things,” Poilâne said.
Ukraine is often referred to as the breadbasket of the world; its ability to export such large amounts of grain is due to its fertile soil and flat terrain. However, with the war in Ukraine affecting their access to grain, many countries will need to look elsewhere.
Right now, even though France has a very high level of wheat production, what is produced is “predominantly for animal feed,” Poilâne notes. “There is a new door to be considered if you don’t have access to your go-to –– which would be the Ukraine [sic].”
Finding locally-milled stone-ground flour is not an easy feat. Poilâne remembers the difficulty her father had in finding British grain to supply the London location. She noted how much of the flour milled in the U.K. was, in fact, from Canadian grain. Even today, Poilâne still uses primarily French grain in the London boutique, as finding traditionally stone-ground British flour proved to be difficult.
“We adapt to whatever is thrown our way, as long as we remain true to our ethos,” Poilâne wrote.
There are five Poilâne Bakeries in Paris and one location in London. A larger bakehouse that handles international orders lies just outside of Paris, in the suburb of Bièvres. Three of the Parisian bakeries supply the other two with bread, and the location in London has its own bakehouse. Additionally, the location in Le Marais hosts a grain library and fermentation lab; a space that pays tribute to the two fundamental aspects of bread: grain and fermentation. 
When asked if she wants to expand further, Poilâne said, “The bulk of our sales is done in Paris and [its] surroundings.” She doesn’t want to add more locations to the list.
Poilâne’s grandfather opened the main Poilâne Bakery in 1932 in Paris. Poilâne’s father, Lionel, opened the London location in 2000. On top of adding three more locations to the list in Paris, Poilâne has only opened one more shop outside of France –– a project in Belgium. Not proving to be financially viable in the long run, the Belgium project was cut short.
Following the coronavirus, Poilâne wants to focus on bringing her bakery back to what it was pre-pandemic. “I think we’re still trying to stabilize and find our standings. I’d love to be able to serve more people around the world that like my products, but I don’t have an obsession with opening bakeries all around the world.”
While she doesn’t want the company to be spread too thin, Poilâne does want to serve the world and her customers, to teach and promote the idea that bread is a connector, an integral part of human life. To fulfill this goal as much as possible, Poilâne offers international shipping to Europe, the U.K., Japan, and North America.
None of this would be possible, Poilâne notes, should she be selling a different product. “The good news is –– and the secret is –– simply that we have a product that allows it,” she said.
A typical Poilâne miche lasts from three to five days. It’s durable, it’s strong, it’s versatile. Not only that, but it’s healthy, it’s real. “You have to have a bread that has flavor, because, otherwise, you know, you’d just go to competition — if you just have quick sugars, then you’ll quite quickly be hungry again,” Poilâne said.
Even more, Poilâne has found new ways to share her philosophy on bread culture. A few years ago, Poilâne gave her very own Masterclass; the online learning platform through which experts across the globe give lessons in their respective fields.
Poilâne taught her class on bread: What it is, how to make it, how to use it. Besides adding more fame to her family name, Poilâne’s techniques are now being used worldwide, and people everywhere are baking round miches with the signature Poilâne “P.”
“It [the Masterclass] is all about teaching the bread culture and what you do with a piece of bread. Not considering that bread is an endpoint, but it might be even a starting point: a starting point of a conversation if the bread is just part of the luncheon or at the dinner table. But also, bread is the starting point of yet more cooking, if you consider that it’s not only the food but can become an ingredient,” she said.
Even more, Poilâne notes that she sees the bakery as the cornerstone of the community. “In France, our bakeries are a very common place and very tightly knit,” she said. Like an American café or general store, Poilâne said, French bakeries are the pillars that uphold French culture.
People are loyal to their bakeries, too. People support their bakeries. People make their trip to the bakery daily; this is what bakeries are; this is what they do. This aspect, as much as the bread itself, is the reason bakeries play such an important role.
And, in the early days of the pandemic, this importance really showed. “We stayed open as essential workers, and, in fact, for the first time in the history of France, we were able to open seven days a week.” Upon seeing my confusion, Poilâne explained, “By law, in France, we could not open more than six days a week.” To which she added, jokingly, “Ridiculous. French.”
At first, Poilâne thought that if the bakery stays open all week, many people will still stop by just once to pick up their bread and go on with their lives. This was not the case. “People would come daily just to have that moment. Not only because we had a rather strict lockdown, but also the human connection.”
At this rare point of human history, bakeries offered much more than just bread. When all the distractions and excess of daily life and business came to a halt, it was very clear what was important to people. The once mindless ritual of going to the bakery in the morning became the center of the day.
Reflecting on her time as an undergraduate at Harvard, Poilâne said, “I had my bread sent every week to my dorm so that I could have something consistent and delicious to start my day with.” If she ran out one day, she would have to venture out before class to find her morning bread. “There is that sense of pilgrimage,” Poilâne said.
“I remember the first day of the lockdown –– before the lockdown hour, basically –– We had a huge queue at the bakery where I had one lady come in and say, ‘I’d like’ –– I can’t remember if it was fifteen or twenty croissants — that she wanted me to wrap individually so she could freeze them for an old granny.”
“She said, ‘Look, I won’t be able to come after the lockdown because you’re beyond the one-kilometer perimeter that we’re allowed to go to, so I’m doing this.’”
The human connection. The hidden moments of kindness.
Bread is more than food. It’s a culture.
A typical day for Poilâne includes overseeing the production, quality checks, and much more, but Poilâne reminisced over the pre-pandemic days in which she and her team would share a coffee in the backroom of the bakery with a “tartine or two of bread and butter.”
The quiet early mornings in the bakery. The rising loaves in the linen-covered baskets. The crusts hardening in the oven. The warmth of the fire. The small moments of the bakery play a big role to everyone involved.
This morning ritual has not yet been revived since the pandemic, though Poilâne hopes it will soon return.
“If you look for me on a typical Saturday, I’ll typically be working in the bakery; both practicing my craft but also testing and trying different things. We’ve had some generational changes since I’ve been in the position where I’ve transmitted some know-how, even though I feel much less experienced than my bakers and pastry chefs.”
But, she added, she knows some tips and tricks that she had learned from the old generations at Poilâne. The gift of cultural legacy, the passing on of knowledge from one person to the next, goes a long way to making Poilâne what it is today.
Across all locations, Poilâne makes between three to five thousand loaves per day. To make and sell this much bread, Poilâne bakes throughout the day, hosting three baking shifts: One from roughly 9:00 pm that finishes at 4:00 am, one from 4:00 am to 11:00 am, and one from 11:00 am from 7:00 pm.
“A typical day is about rituals to ensure the quality of production.”
In about 10 years, Poilâne will have had its 100th anniversary. It’s “just symbolic at this point,” Poilâne added. But, it’s significant. Poilâne’s grandfather first put Poilâne’s name on the storefront at 8 Rue du Cherche-Midi 100 years ago. The sourdough’s ancestor will have come into existence 100 years ago. The foundation for Poilâne’s life’s work will have been established 100 years ago.
But above sentimentality, Poilâne is looking to the future. “I really want to change the way people look at bread.”
People have to look “beyond the bread,” she said. “It’s all the culture it carries, the connection it makes, and the value chain between the grain and the bakehouse –– what happens in between and everything that happens thereafter.”
More than nurturing the bakery, Poilane said her duty is to develop opportunities to share the knowledge of bread. Bread, over all, is a building block. From it, civilizations have emerged; great improvement and innovation have occurred. All because of bread and the life it gives.
“It fashions our civilizations, cities, because, when you grow grain, you don’t grow it alone.”
“I love any opportunity that I am given to share the beauty of my craft,” Poilâne said. “I’m not trying to deny or overlook the hardship of it, but there is something very beautiful about it. And, if it doesn’t do anything else but nurture our clients’ appreciation for what they have in their hand, I’ve definitely won a battle there,” she laughs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I FaceTime my entire family every day. I often get surprised looks when I tell my peers this fact; they frequently claim that’s too much communication. The thing is, I may suffer from the disease of homesickness.
We don’t typically think of homesickness as a disease, but perhaps we should.
Early on, the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates attributed homesickness to excessive black bile in the blood. Johannes Hofer later provided a neurological explanation, suggesting that new environments stimulated nerves into a frenzy known as homesickness.
Homesickness was documented as a major issue in 17th and 18th-century Swiss soldiers. When they were outsourced to French armies that required long and rigorous training, they lost their sense of individuality and longed for home. Similarly, some historical sailors were so plagued by homesickness that they would even jump off ships.
We clearly cannot compare the severity of preparing for war four centuries ago with that of attending college in the 21st century. Still, pursuing new social groups, exploring interests, and finding a place to fit in can all exacerbate homesickness at Harvard. Taken together, these college-specific difficulties can lead to academic troubles, anxiety, depression, and other ailments. Homesickness could be more prevalent than the freshman flu — despite its visibly milder symptoms.
Biologically, homesickness could be characterized as an extension of post-traumatic stress disorder. Some researchers have even posited that homesickness could be an evolutionary relic of early survival mechanisms, vitally helping proto-humans return and revisit social groups, allowing for better protection.
I was very homesick at Harvard. I checked the box for many risk factors of the disease: I had little experience living alone, have a rather reserved personality, and am very close to my family. It was definitely a difficult transition. I very much sought a cure.
There were many early theories to cure homesickness, including through fear. Famous American psychologist Benjamin Rush even reported of a general who buried alive some soldiers afflicted with homesickness, instilling such a fear of the disease that it was eliminated from the army.
Luckily, there are less severe ways to cure the disease today. Recent research suggests that some of the best ways to overcome homesickness are to immerse yourself in your surroundings and to reflect positively on your new situation. For the homesick underclassman, choosing interesting classes, interacting with your new community, and getting accustomed to Harvard culture are all ways to combat homesickness and start thinking of Harvard as home.
I did just this to fix my affliction: I filled my calendar with classes, office hours, and activities for organizations (like writing for The Crimson). I learned to savor my independence and to structure my time more efficiently. And of course, I called home daily.
But, by immersing ourselves in our school, it can be easy to forget about the people who helped bring us here: our family.
Homesickness goes both ways: We long for home, and it longs for us. On the flip side of college students’ homesickness is their parents’ empty nest syndrome — the equivalent grief brought about by children growing up and moving out of a family home.
While my siblings and I have moved into schools filled with vibrant student life and peers, we have left our parents alone, in a startlingly quiet house. One way to combat empty nest syndrome is to simply keep in contact. Technology has made this extremely easy; even a five-minute phone call can be productive for both homesickness and empty nest syndrome sufferers.
College is undoubtedly a time of finding independence and learning to deal with problems on your own. Calling your parents every time an issue comes up can prevent you from experiencing college fully and actually exacerbate feelings of homesickness, as you become more aware of the separation between you and loved ones.
But communicating with a simple text or call every few days can make everyone happier. Communication is one of the most efficient cures for homesickness — and you can do it while walking from class, grabbing a quick bite to eat, or taking a study break. So, if you haven’t already, make it a point to call home today!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Who cares about all these student government elections?”
This apathetic sentiment has seemingly become commonplace in recent years. It makes sense: The Harvard Undergraduate Association is a student government so chaotic it found itself the center of student criticism only a week into this academic year.
There’s just one problem with the otherwise blissful ignorance of pretending the HUA doesn’t exist: club funding.
I’m not here to talk about clubs’ contentious food budgets or private events. It’s hard to see these disputes as anything but a sideshow when the clubs themselves are not accessible to low-income students. As a part of Harvard’s frustratingly small low-income student body, my tuition and room and board are completely covered by need-based financial aid. But I still found that I needed to work a part-time job on the side.
The truth is, no matter what low-income students do, a full ride will never be quite enough to meet all of our needs; even if I manage to make it to the dining hall on time for every meal, never get injured or sick, avoid traveling anywhere I can’t walk, and cut every last hobby out of my life, I’d still have to pay for textbooks. In fact, the College appears well aware of these expenses: They already estimate an individual student will need $3,500 for “Personal Expenses” on financial aid documents, which they elaborate should be met with the “Student Term-Time Work Expectation.”
So I secured a part-time job in Cambridge before I ever stepped foot on Harvard’s campus. I even took pride in my newfound financial independence. But one recurring question in the neverending cycle of the Harvard intro kept haunting me: “What clubs are you in?”
The answer was simple: “None.” Being a full-time Harvard student and working 15 hours a week just didn’t leave time for anything but a handful of Fuerza Latina events. I was well aware that countless opportunities were passing me by, but I didn’t have a second to spare. I felt like I was hardly making the most of my time at Harvard, like all my classmates seemed to be doing.
So what changed? How am I even writing this op-ed? Well, eventually, I found out that The Crimson has a need-based financial aid program for its low-income writers that pays them for their work, essentially serving as a job replacement.
But The Crimson is financially independent from the College. As it stands, the College’s funding is wholly inadequate for most student groups to compensate club members for their work. The Crimson pays individual low-income members up to $1,500 per semester, while the average student group received a total of $650 from the University annually as of 2018 — a figure that would have grown to just over $1,730 today, assuming club funding increased proportionally to the student activities fee.
In other words, even assuming students were no less willing to pay the increased student activities fee, it would take almost the entire budget of the average student organization to pay a single member for a semester’s work, making such a proposal a non-starter under the current club funding structure — and leaving low-income students on the outside, looking in.
Unsurprisingly, this has helped foster a campus culture defined by inequity: While low-income students often find themselves stuck working low-wage jobs to meet their needs, wealthy students gain professional experience and connections in student organizations from the Institute of Politics to Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment.
Worse yet, this seems to create a cycle of exclusion. When low-income students are left on the outside looking in, student organizations are less likely to cater to the needs of the low-income members they do have.
So, how do we fix it? On one hand, Harvard could offer further direct financial support to low-income students, providing them the same degree of autonomy wealthy students already have. But this seems highly unlikely, especially given the College’s expectation that “personal expenses” be met through term-time work.
On the other hand, the College’s leadership could move to overhaul the club funding structure, ensuring that clubs — particularly those with pre-professional implications — offer pay to highly involved members. This approach is likely more palatable for an administration that seems unwilling to award financial assistance for all but the most basic living expenses.
While it’s understandably easy to lose sight of the importance of club funding when it so often is devoted to nothing but merchandise, an El Jefe’s or Kung Fu Tea budget, and an occasional off-campus event, the HUA’s club funding responsibility is crucial for the accessibility of student organizations to low-income students. It can be entertaining to laugh as we watch the frenzy that ensues when we trust a group of unqualified wannabe politicians to manage hundreds of thousands of dollars, but we cannot lose sight of the serious work they are neglecting. When the stakes are as high as they are, we can’t afford to ignore the fact that an organization whose only meaningful responsibility is club funding devoted 19 percent of their $550,000 budget to expenses other than student organizations this year.
Frighteningly, our student government’s lack of credibility may actively discourage students from paying the optional student activities fee. And can we really expect the College to offer the HUA truly adequate funding beyond the student activities fee when students themselves do not trust the student government with their money?
As much as I hate to say it, the HUA’s work matters. But let me be clear. When I vote in an HUA election, I’m not voting because I buy into our broken system. I’m voting because I care about the work that broken system is supposed to do.
If the HUA cares about its only job, then it’s time to prove it by making a meaningful push for financial aid within student organizations. Club funding affects real people. When we pretend it doesn’t, we wind up with the completely inadequate and exclusive system we see today: Clubs for the rich, and jobs for everyone else.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all the talk about bubble tea, we’re surprised our colleagues on the Editorial Board are unable to recognize the more ebullient bubble that surrounds us. We want to see Harvard Square improve as much as the next person, but there are some serious issues with how we’ve been thinking about it.
Firstly, Cambridge and Somerville are vibrant and bustling communities, forming one of the most densely populated regions in the United States. Perhaps their liveliness stems from their impressive connectivity and accessibility — at least relative to the rest of our car-dependent country. So why doesn’t the Board venture a little outside of Harvard Square instead of focusing exclusively on the store availability here?
Sure, when it comes to more accessible restaurants and food options, Harvard Square isn’t the best, especially for low-income students like us. But we’re having the wrong conversation here. It’s true that there are few grocery stores in the Square itself, but let’s not forget the other neighborhoods nearby with plenty of food options. If you want a convenient and cheap grocery store, Market Basket is only a 15-minute bus ride away (10 minutes if you want to cycle). And, of course, there’s always the option to take the Red Line just one stop in either direction. Have our colleagues considered the Star Market in Porter Square or the Whole Foods in Central? The Targets near both?
Even if grocery stores abounded in Harvard Square, we doubt many of us are cooking every day in the limited kitchen space we have, given that we have a dining hall system that we can use. Then again, didn’t this Board reject hot breakfast, claiming “there’s no such thing as a free lunch?” The call to “let them eat toast” was dismissive and counterproductive to the conversation of expanding access to food options for Harvard students.
The Board discusses the amusing idea of subsidizing food in the Square, which reinforces the idea that Harvard students should never stray more than 5,000 feet from their dorms. How about the University subsidizes MBTA passes for its undergraduate students, following the leads of its neighbors like Boston University, Tufts, MIT — heck, even its own graduate schools?
No, the real issue with this Board’s reasoning isn’t just about food access. Instead, we should call out Harvard’s predatory relationship with the Square; the Board has already recognized how the University’s investment in the city is inadequate, and we should continue doing so.
Cambridge’s rising land and rent costs — which likely play a role in the Square’s makeup of mostly expensive shops — are largely a result of Harvard’s expansion and influence, and we need to be conscious of the University’s effects on both the unhoused community and the working-class people who live here.
We can’t just expect Harvard Square to transform into a prototypical college town in the middle of Cambridge. As much as we may want student-focused businesses in The Square, there’s no denying that they’re fighting an uphill battle against the tourism industry in a neighborhood with skyrocketing prices.
It’s time we asked ourselves, who’s really to blame for Harvard Square being so inaccessible: individual tourists or the multibillion-dollar university that created a local economy with 16 dessert shops, more than 10 banks, and an overpriced CVS in an effort to appeal to them?
So, as members of the Cambridge community new and old, what does resisting the physical dominance of the University mean for us all? It means we need to be more engaged with the community around us by supporting local businesses, not just familiar chains. It means getting to know our working-class neighbors and being conscious of our impact on the community. It means fighting modern investment models that usually result in generic, mind-numbing architecture and corporate sameness. We need to see our cities as “a container for human life,” as urban studies journalist Jane Jacobs put it.
And yes, there are still access barriers that we need to address, and it would certainly be nice to have affordable food options nearby. But let’s not act like a 15-minute walk or a bike ride is some insurmountable obstacle. It’s actually the goal.
We can be grateful for the resources we have — including the stores we live near — while also being aware of the broader issues creating mobility injustice. We don’t actually disagree with the Board’s conversation about zoning, and we think it’s good to reevaluate how we regulate business and housing development. But we can’t just focus on our own needs and wants; we need to be mindful of the needs and wants of the entire community.
So let’s pop the Harvard bubble, step outside a bit, and engage with them. Harvard Square is not the center of the universe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Möge Tee, the fourth bubble tea shop in Harvard Square, is now open for business. With this new store joining the ranks of other post-pandemic players like Blue Bottle and Tiger Sugar, the Square has never been more welcoming and alluring to budding beverage connoisseurs — the kind willing to drop upwards of $6 on a tea or latte, that is.
To be clear, we have nothing against bubble tea. We believe food can serve as a practical, delectable entrance point to a variety of cultures and we reject the potential conflation of diverse food options with inaccessibility as both misguided and demonstrably false. But even as we maintain the value of cultural food options in the Square, the new bubble tea shop’s opening reminds us of a problem that has long plagued Harvard Square: the affordability crisis.
With a cost of living 75 percent higher than the national average, students and residents in Cambridge suffer from a lack of cheap food options — and only exceedingly wealthy student groups can readily afford to own off-campus social spaces, atrophying social life. It often feels like Harvard Square is built for wealthy tourists, with storefronts featuring a saturation of luxury brands and restaurants that many Harvard students would likely never consider stepping foot into (or risk draining their wallets by doing so).
Amidst a national reckoning on land use, we, too, must reckon with the larger, structural forces that shape the shops we pass, but hardly enter, on our way to class. We’re talking about zoning codes.
Cambridge zoning regulations have a distinct set of rules governing fast food. Regulating everything from the restaurant exterior’s sensitivity to the “visual and physical characteristics of other buildings” to effects on double parking and neighborhood safety, Cambridge has effectively constructed a massive roadblock to new quick-service and affordable food establishments.
Some of the results: $1.6 million for the average Cambridge family home. $14 salad at Sweetgreen, but no McDonalds in the Square. Packed bars without empty tables as early as 10 p.m. An abundance of beverage shops with menu items priced at or higher than half the hourly minimum wage.
In one of the most liberal cities in America, low-income residents and low-price businesses have found themselves victims of a wealthy gatekeeping policy — one with disproportionate negative effects on unhoused residents, whose housing insecurity is overwhelmingly due to rising rent prices in the city.
We don’t claim to know the full solution to our pricing woes. But one step is dizzyingly obvious: Allow more houses and restaurants to be built, thereby lowering property prices. The city of Cambridge and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts need to loosen their overly restrictive zoning regulations. And they need to do this now.
It’s equally obvious that zoning codes are not the only upward pressure on urban prices, and that cheaper commercial properties do not necessarily translate to cheaper options for consumers. But, by definition, zoning laws constrain what can be built and who can afford commercial and residential space. This isn’t just a Cambridge problem; it’s happening all across the U.S.
At a time when affordable housing supply trails demand by nearly four million units, restrictions like large minimum lot sizes, single-family occupancy requirements for residential units, and arbitrary height ceilings have the effect of preventing our cities from meeting the demand they face — causing housing prices to balloon as a result.
Liberalizing these draconian regulations — which were initially enacted to keep out residents of a lower socioeconomic status — would go a long way towards creating a more equitable Cambridge, from cheaper housing to more affordable food options.
Until then, Harvard should subsidize food options in the Square, particularly for low-income students who are left with nothing but overpriced salad bowls and burgers that figure somewhere in the double digits. Extending dining hall hours, too, would help prevent students from being forced out into an increasingly unaffordable food scene once the servery doors close for the evening.
It isn’t any lack of want by students that prevents us from having more options for nightlife, affordable food, and other amenities in Harvard Square. We want more bars, a bite that doesn’t drain our wallets, and a college town environment that feels like a community and treats people as such, buoyed by relationships that exist past a credit card transaction.
We love Grendel’s Den. But we wouldn’t say no to a Toad’s Place by its side — nor any amendment to zoning regulations that would result in a more lively, accessible, and inclusive Square for all.

Thomas B. Fox ’95, son of John B. Fox Jr. ’59, recalled how his freshman roommates in Greenough Hall would often turn to his father “for advice, not about the school, but about their lives.”
“When my freshman roommates learned that my father was an administrator at the school, I can only imagine their first reaction was, ‘Oh, okay, well, this person Tom must know a lot about the University or be influenced by the University,’” Fox said.
But when they met his father in person, they realized quickly that “the advice and counsel that they would get from him had nothing to do with the University and only had to do with themselves,” Fox said.
Laura G. Fisher, associate dean for faculty development in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences under Fox, remembered how she felt when she first saw him: a towering man standing at 6 feet, 8 inches.
“On first impression, you can’t not notice his height. And he certainly towered over me,” she said. “I suppose he could appear intimidating, but he wasn’t.”
According to many, John Fox strived to make Harvard a more inclusive environment that could respond to every student’s needs. He died three months ago on Nov. 27 at the age of 86.
He began his career at the University as director of the Office of Career Services in 1967, then called the Office of Graduate and Career Services. He then served stints as assistant dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1971 to 1976; Harvard College dean until 1985; administrative dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to 1993; and secretary of the Faculty Council, retiring in 2007.
Fox spearheaded the “Fox Plan,” which moved all freshmen to the Yard and oversaw major renovations to the three houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle in the 1970s.
The Fox Plan formed the basis of the current undergraduate House system, which Fox hoped would solve a multitude of problems of the old system: unequal facilities and “inequities” in “class composition” among different houses, differential housing and advising arrangements for freshmen, declining popularity of houses in the Quad, and a lottery system that many thought was not “sufficiently ‘open’ and comprehensible.”
“Most of these problems are the result of built-in inequities (or differences) in the system; that is, they spring from the fact that our current system renders it impossible for any incoming class of students to experience the House system in closely comparable terms,” Fox wrote in his details of the plan, published in The Crimson.
One of Fox’s overarching philosophies as dean of the College was to open “Harvard’s gates to a broader world,” according to Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, who first served Fox as senior tutor of North House — a position known today as Pforzheimer House resident dean. McGrath later worked under Fox as assistant dean of Harvard College.
“I think he knew that when students came to Harvard, one of the important things that the College should do was challenge them to think about what they really wanted to do and who they really were,” McGrath said.
Fox also sought to bring in students from diverse backgrounds, according to Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who worked as Fox’s assistant during his tenure as dean of the College.
“He, in particular, went out early in his deanship to make sure that underrepresented minorities and women were well supported in the College,” Dingman said.
Fisher, whom Fox brought on as the first woman on the College’s Administrative Board, said Fox opened many doors for women and minorities.
“He was very supportive of women, and he hired a lot of women. I was actually the first woman senior tutor in a Harvard house,” said Fisher, who resided in Eliot House at the time.
Julia G. “Judy” Fox, John Fox’s wife of 55 years and who worked as the director of the Transfer and Visiting Student Programs at Harvard, said her first impression of him was of a very well-read and artistic man.
“He was very cultured. I remember he introduced me — I was pretty young — he introduced me to a variety of classical music that I was not familiar with. I always liked classical music, but he would give me — this was the era of LPs — so he would give me records,” she said. “And even now, if I hear something on the radio that we used to listen to years ago, I get great pleasure from that.”
John Fox would often go to his family home in Andover, Maine, away from his work as dean, according to Dingman.
“He would quickly get rid of his office jacket and tie and put out a flannel shirt and hop on a tractor,” Dingman said. “My wife and I visited John and his family there, and it was great to see the affection he had for the land.”
Fox was also interested in tracing back his familial roots and digging through records, Dingman said, which spurred his love for archival research.
“He never set out to do something without exploring in the archives a lot more about the topic,” Dingman said.
Julia Fox said John Fox had a love for art and handling physical objects, among his other pastimes and intellectual hobbies.
“He was the son and grandson of artists. His mother was a sculptor; her father was a landscape painter. Both his mother and his grandfather won awards for their work,” she said. “We have a lot of their stuff in the house: wonderful, wonderful paintings and sculptures.”
This artistic touch passed onto John Fox, she said, who had a workshop in his basement and “loved to tinker with his hands, fixing things, building things.”
Fox also enjoyed skiing and trekking through the surrounding forests, McGrath said.
“In fact, he tried to teach me to ski, which was not a great success, but he loved the northern woods,” McGrath said. “He loved traveling, but I think what he really loved was he liked the rural areas that were forested.”
Fox and his wife frequently hosted dinners at their house for staff members at the College, which Fisher said demonstrated his caring nature toward his colleagues.
“I recall one dinner where he stopped everyone and he said, ‘Do you see what’s happening here?’ And there were six of us. We were sitting next to each other, and we were all left-handed. It was just part of the fabric that is emblematic of his attention to individuals,” Fisher said.
Dingman described Fox as “a friend as well as a boss.”
“He showed a lot of interest in his staff, so when we had our first child in 1979, John was always asking questions about her well-being and how we were doing as new parents,” he said. “Sometimes bosses are too tied up in their day-to-day responsibilities to add that personal touch, but it was a more than welcome gesture.”
According to McGrath, Fox was pragmatic and modest, and other administrators and staff looked up to him as a hard worker and a “unifying presence.”
“I think he would like to be remembered for his personal qualities and his character and his integrity, which was really quite inspirational. He had a great sense of humor. Very dry, but very, very real, smart sense,” McGrath said.
Throughout his career, Dingman said Fox upheld the core values of the University while adapting the College to an ever-transforming student body.
“I think he would want to be remembered as a defender of the best qualities of Harvard,” Dingman said. “So I would say that he cared a lot about veritas, but he cared also about individuals and proceeded with caution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roust Deli, a “relaxed” cafe serving coffee and sandwiches, quietly opened its doors earlier this month in the space formerly occupied by Darwin’s Ltd. in Harvard Square.
Located at 148 Mt. Auburn St., the cafe served its first customers on Feb. 5 with just a few menu offerings, including coffee, latte, espresso, hot chocolate, and a few pastries. While the business model between Roust and Darwin’s is similar, Mike Spires — the manager of both Roust and the former Darwin’s location — said that he has been focused on creating a “bit more of a modern menu.”
“I think the food will be a little better,” Spires said.
In contrast to Darwin’s “busy” atmosphere, Spires also hopes to “make things more efficient” at Roust Deli.
“We want to make enough recipes to make more to-go options — things that people can come in and buy from a fridge and run away with immediately to keep things flowing a little faster,” Spires said.
Valentin Terteliu Hefco, the owner of Roust Deli and Tokava Coffee in Jamaica Plain, had not heard about the closing of Darwin’s prior to buying the location. He said he was looking for a place to open up a deli shop when he found the property listing online.
“It’s in line with my interest. So that’s it. I didn’t know any stories,” Hefco said.
Of the six staff members at Roust, two employees — including Spires — worked for Darwin’s Ltd. Spires said that Steven Darwin, the co-owner of Darwin’s Ltd., connected him to Hefco after it was announced that the longstanding chain would be shuttering its doors late last year.
A small group of former Darwin’s employees, Circus Co-op, had sought to open worker-owned cafe at a former Darwin’s location on Cambridge Street until the building was bought in early February. The group is now looking at the two remaining former Darwin’s locations and other locations in the area.
Spires said that starting this business from “right off the ground” has been challenging.
Outside the store, remnants of the recently-closed chain still remain, including the classic “Darwin’s Ltd.” sign with blue lettering — to which Spires said they have to work on getting permits to remove.
Roust is also waiting on the two-month transfer period for Darwin’s wine and malt store license. Spires said the cafe plans on having “an identical lineup of wines and beers.”
On a quiet Monday morning, customers at the cafe worked on their laptops and sipped on their coffees.
Compared to other cafes in the area, Paul Dingus, a master’s student at Harvard Kennedy School, said this cafe “feels more homey.”
“It’s a place where I don’t feel rushed, like in or out the door,” he said.
As a past customer of Darwin’s, Dingus said he was “thrilled when this place opened back up.”
Alicia D. Rolsma, a Cambridge resident, said the cafe feels “cozy” and “very locally embedded.”
“I had been to Darwin’s in the past, but I kind of like this vibe better,” she said as she relaxed with a book in one of the cafe’s cushioned chairs.
Valerie Peck, a Cambridge resident, said she liked Darwin’s but also enjoyed the “new atmosphere.” She said there is always ample seating for her to get work done at Roust, unlike at other “much smaller” coffee shops nearby.
“I love the lighting. Staff is very courteous, and it’s a good place to work for now, just to get out of the house,” Peck said.
On attracting former patrons of Darwin’s and new customers, Spires said he hopes to let Roust’s food speak for itself. The plan, Spires said, is “to make good food, tell them to come in, try it, and want to come back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sophomore Shriya S. Yarlagadda ’25 returned to “Jeopardy!” Thursday evening for the show’s High School Reunion Tournament, scoring $21,601 and falling just $1,622 short of advancing to the next round.
Yarlagadda previously competed in the show’s 2019 Teen Tournament as a high school sophomore, where she reached the semifinal round.
Yarlagadda said the reunion tournament lived up to its name.
“I had made some of the most wonderful friends when I competed in high school,” Yarlagadda said in a Monday interview. “To have the opportunity to go back and meet everyone again, have another shot at the stage was just really incredible.”
A life-long Jeopardy! fan, Yarlagadda first found herself on the show after scoring highly on an online qualifying test.
“I think that the thing that helped me the most was doing Quiz Bowl in middle school and high school,” Yarlagadda said. “Before that, I had done geography bees, and so I think I had that pretty solid geography knowledge base that would be very connected to so many other subjects as well.”
Yarlagadda studied extensively for the competition over winter break, especially literature, a weak category for her. But when it came time to compete, she said her time on stage was “very much a blur.”
“I was just rolling with the punches and focusing on trying to answer everything as best as I could.”
Though Yarlagadda actually competed in late January, she was forbidden from disclosing any results until her episode aired on Feb. 23. This policy extended to close family and friends, who she said largely refrained from prying.
“I was just able to tell my friends ‘Hey, this is a stressful experience already. I would really appreciate it if you guys understand the fact that I’m under NDA,’” she said.
Similarly, Yarlagadda knew that she would be competing for multiple weeks before she was able to tell her roommates. When she finally broke the news, Yarlagadda said her friends were “incredibly sweet.”
“Their immediate reaction was to start looking up flight prices, so they could try to go out to LA,” she said.
Though they didn’t make it out to see the live taping, Yarlagadda and her friends held a watch party in the Lowell House junior common room.
After a nerve-wracking first “Jeopardy!” appearance, Yarlagadda said she found it much easier to enjoy the experience the second time around.
“I don’t think there was a single moment that day where I felt any sense of nerves and it was just overall really enjoyable and there was no negativity at all,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 protesters condemned Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 and other city officials during a Monday rally and teach-in at City Hall for not releasing the names of officers involved in the January police killing of Sayed Faisal.
Organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, the protest at City Hall attracted Boston-area residents, including local teachers and students, as the latest demonstration in a nearly two-month campaign by activists to demand accountability from Cambridge officials.
Faisal, a 20-year-old Cambridge resident and Bangladeshi American college student, was fatally shot by a Cambridge Police Department officer on Jan. 4 after officers responded to a 911 report of a man harming himself, according to a Cambridge Police press release. After a five-block chase through Cambridgeport, officers confronted Faisal, who allegedly approached them wielding a knife. When a non-lethal sponge round did not stop Faisal, a CPD officer shot and killed him.
Faisal’s death has sparked protests against police brutality and racism throughout Cambridge, with residents demanding answers and transparency from city leadership.
Crowding the first floor and main staircase of City Hall, protesters reiterated their demands to city officials, including releasing the names of officers involved in Faisal’s shooting and prosecuting them. The city has “been ignoring the community’s calls for transparency and justice,” said Rafeya V. Raquib, an organizer with the PSL.
“The police who are paid with our tax dollars and are allowed to shoot people dead in the streets without facing any immediate consequences apparently deserve the right to privacy during the investigation,” Raquib said.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui wrote in a Thursday statement that “our charter grants the City Manager power over the Police Department as well as oversight of personnel matters,” but added she supports the release of the officer’s names.
“I personally believe this is an important step for the sake of transparency, but a statement released last week made clear the City will not do so,” Siddiqui wrote.
Statements from Huang and CPD Commissioner Christine A. Elow released last week reiterated city officials’ plans to release the names after the conclusion of the Middlesex District Attorney’s inquest into the shooting.
PSL organizer Suhail P. Purkar called Cambridge’s government “an undemocratic mess.” Purkar, along with other demonstrators, took aim at Huang, criticizing him and other city officials for their handling of Cambridge’s response to Faisal’s death.
Under Cambridge’s Plan E Charter, the city is run under a council-manager form of government, giving Huang control over the city’s daily operations and preparation of the budget.
In an emailed statement following Monday’s council meeting, Huang wrote that he remains “committed to being accessible and accountable” to Cambridge residents.
“Since the tragic death of Sayed Faisal, I have been in regular conversation with the Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilors as we have worked to chart a path forward together, including implementing body cameras, alternate response, and a third-party review,” Huang wrote.
In a city press release last week, Huang wrote the city is moving forward with a plan to implement body cameras, as well as other accountability measures.
Purkar said the city’s current charter deprives Cambridge residents of accountability in city government.
“We’ve seen that the city manager has the freedom to pick and choose what policies get enforced with no accountability,” Raquib said.
During the teach-in at City Hall, organizers led attendees through songs and chants about activist leaders and spoke on the history of student organizing, the civil rights movement, and the origins of policing.
Raquib said organizers would need to continue pushing to hold Cambridge officials accountable.
“We cannot let city officials continue to try to deflect blame and appease the public with empty words of condolences and blanket commitments,” she added.
On March 13, Boston-area college students will seek to occupy City Hall to continue protesting the police shooting of Faisal, after two weeks of outreach and preparation at local universities.
“If we don’t fight, it’s going to be stopped, and it’s going to be going under the rug,” said Bangladesh Association of New England President Pervin A. Chowdhury during the teach-in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Cornell Williams Brooks said policing in the United States is in a “state of crisis” at a Harvard Institute of Politics Forum Monday evening.
The event highlighted the high-profile killing of Tyre Nichols, who died in early January three days after a violent traffic stop in which Memphis police officers repeatedly beat Nichols, according to body camera and surveillance footage released by the Memphis Police Department. Five police officers in the case, which sparked nationwide uproar over police brutality, have since been fired and charged with various felonies, including second-degree murder.
The discussion, titled “A Conversation about Policing and Racial Justice,” also featured Kennedy School professors Sandra Susan Smith and Yanilnda María González and was moderated by IOP Interim Director Setti D. Warren.
Despite the nationwide backlash following Nichols’ killing, Warren noted the case did not garner the same media attention and public uproar as the murder of George Floyd, which led to mass protests across the country during the summer of 2020.
Gonzalez said she believes three factors account for the differences in public reactions to the two cases: a normalization of police violence, the fact that the police officers in the case are Black, and the “preeminent” arrest of the officers.
“We have collectively let ourselves off the hook in grappling at a more deep level with the killing of Tyre Nichols,” she said.
Brooks, who served as the 18th president of the NAACP, said he believes the Memphis police chief chose to release video footage of the case as quickly as possible in order to manage the public’s response to Nichols’ killing.
“Literally the entire country is waiting to find out whether or not Memphis is going to go up in smoke,” he said. “And let’s be absolutely clear: The fact that these were Black officers has a little more than something to do with how quickly they were prosecuted and the charges that were brought.”
Smith said police killing cases have a widespread impact in the places they occur, citing an HKS study that found that residential areas in which a police killing recently took place see higher rates of school absences, lower GPAs, and lower graduation and college matriculation rates.
“It’s not just about the individuals who have been brutalized and their immediate family, it’s about the communities who are impacted by that brutalization,” she said. “It’s about the children who stopped going to school because of the impact it’s having on them.”
“This causes a kind of harm that sticks with us. This is what Black and brown people are carrying in their daily lives,” Smith added.
Smith said she believes cities can “decenter” police by training a civilian force to enforce traffic laws and creating crisis intervention mobile units of individuals trained in EMT and crisis resolution.
Brooks also criticized the lack of policy changes in police departments across the country following Floyd’s murder.
“There’s no other industry in the country that is literally in a state of crisis and, to the equal degree, in a state of collective self-denial,” Brooks said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Chicago law professor William P. Baude discussed moving “beyond textualism” — a form of legal interpretation that draws conclusions based primarily on the plain meaning of legal documents — at Harvard Law School’s annual Scalia lecture held Monday.
The lecture, established in 2013 to honor the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has previously featured Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, and Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82.
In opening remarks, Manning welcomed Justice Scalia’s wife Maureen M. Scalia ’60 to the event and spoke about his memories of the justice.
“As Justice Scalia’s law clerk, I got to know him very well. He loved the law, he loved ideas, and perhaps, above all, he loved to mix it up,” Manning said. “That’s how he learned and that’s how he encouraged others to learn.”
Following Manning’s introductory address, Baude opened his lecture by saying he was “honored and thrilled” to be speaking at the event, quipping that he believed he had “watched every Scalia lecture available on YouTube.”
Baude, the faculty director of UChicago’s Constitutional Law Institute, said textualism in its current form falls short, because without additional information, textualist interpretations can often fail to provide concrete answers.
“The problem is that the text itself, even the text supplemented by something like the original meaning of the text, is incomplete,” he said. “It gives incomplete or misleading answers to important questions about the law, and so it needs to be supplemented with attention to our entire legal framework, because our legal system relies not just on written texts but also unwritten law.”
He provided examples of “unwritten law,” which he described as including common law that predates the Constitution, “unwritten principles” — such as the idea that the legal system is “not supposed to hold the whole legislature liable for having enacted an unconstitutional statute” — and the canons of construction, which are the rules used to interpret legal text.
“We need unwritten law as a backdrop against which to read legal texts. We need unwritten law to understand the common law system, the real common law system, not the system of judge-made law that has usurped it,” Baude said. “And we need unwritten law because our legal texts sometimes point us toward it, and we need to know how to accept the invitation.”
He emphasized that using unwritten law to aid the interpretation of written law does not stray from textualist principles.
“Textualism, to a first approximation, is central to the rule of law. But to a second approximation, we sometimes need to use other legal rules, like unwritten law, and doing so is completely consistent with the reasons that we use legal texts,” he said.
Baude said that not considering unwritten law risks “leading us to close our eyes to the meaning of the constitutional text,” noting that failing to teach students to use unwritten law to aid textualism would lead students astray.
“If we do not teach our students how to do these things, if we do not revive the more fundamental pre-realist tenets of our legal tradition, then our students will be misled into thinking that the only choices are the plain text and judicial policymaking,” Baude said.
“That is not true, and I will take my chances in saying so,” he added.

Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow was awarded the Prairie View A&M University President’s Medal by the university’s outgoing president Ruth J. Simmons at a Monday afternoon ceremony.
Harvard announced hours before the Prairie View event that Simmons will be appointed senior adviser to the president of Harvard on engagement with historically Black colleges and universities. Simmons will step down from her role as president at the end of the month.
Sara N. Bleich — who was recently appointed Harvard’s vice provost for special projects — opened the event with an overview of the University’s work on implementing recommendations from its April 2022 Legacy of Slavery report.
Bleich announced that Harvard intends to assemble HBCU presidents at a conference this fall, a next step in implementing the report’s third recommendation — establishing stronger relationships with HBCUs.
“We hope to convene a group of HBCU presidents to explore how we can deepen and expand our connections and partnerships and how we can assist those leaders in addressing their goals and challenges,” Bleich said.
Bleich called Harvard’s landmark Legacy of Slavery initiative both “sobering” and “exciting.”
“We very much look forward to working and learning from others and advancing this initiative in a way that is worthy of those lives that were so constrained by slavery and its legacies,” she said.
The event, held on Simmons’ penultimate day in office as president, offered an opportunity for the two outgoing university presidents to reflect on their careers in higher education and to shower praise on each other.
Simmons commended Bacow for leading Harvard with a “warm heart and a generous mind,” citing his leadership as the University defended affirmative action and supported students in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
“As 29th president of Harvard University, you have led that remarkable institution with enviable distinction,” Simmons said to Bacow. “You have led with the conviction that truth and transparency must be essential elements of university leadership.”
In his remarks, Bacow told the audience that “there is no one — and I mean no one — who has accomplished more or is respected more greatly than your Ruth Simmons.”
Bacow also discussed the challenges currently facing universities, emphasizing a decrease in public support for higher education, taxes on endowments, and concerns over the ability to teach freely in the classroom.
“People are asking whether or not institutions like ours are actually good for society,” Bacow said.
“I don’t think we can take any of these things for granted. I think we have to fight to retain them,” he added. “In some cases, we have to go down fighting.”
Simmons concluded the event by saying she looks forward to working with President-elect Claudine Gay to foster stronger connections with HBCUs in her advisory role.
“This is the moment for HBCUs to receive their fair share,” Simmons said. “And I’m so happy that Harvard is going to be leading that process of thinking through what can be done.”
“We don’t need to worry about what we haven’t gotten in the past,” she added. “We just need to worry about what we get now — and we have to be more insistent about how deserving HBCUs are of additional support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Divinity School professor of African American Religious Studies Terrence L. Johnson discussed changing the conversation around reparations in a virtual lecture Monday evening.
The fourth installment of the Divinity School’s “Religion and Legacies of Slavery” series, the lecture focused on the malleability of historical memory, creativity in envisioning reparations, and the importance of collective accountability to redress the harms of slavery.
The lecture series builds on the University’s landmark 2022 Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery report and aims to engage HDS faculty and students in conversation about the lasting impacts of slavery in a religious context.
Divinity School administrators Diane L. Moore and Melissa Wood Bartholomew moderated the event. In her introduction, Moore — who serves as the HDS faculty director of Religion and Public Life — said she was “grateful” that hundreds of affiliates from 80 different countries tuned in to the lecture.
Johnson used Henry Ossawa Tanner’s 1929 painting, “Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,” to introduce the themes of his lecture.
“Through his use of color and delicate streams of light that conceals the apparent destruction of Gomorrah, we’re left pondering questions of memory, accountability, and repair,” Johnson said.
Johnson drew a contrast between the role of historical memory in discussions on reparations for enslavement as compared to other movements to redress systemic harm throughout history.
“Reparation debates, for instance, for Holocaust survivors and those in Japanese internment camps often took a different tone,” Johnson said.
“Heartbreaking accounts from survivors of Japanese internment camps were taken at face value,” he said. “Whereas debates on Black suffering and death are stalled before they are developed. We are burdened by claims that enslavement was justified based on historical norms.”
Johnson stressed the importance of putting reparations “on the table” to create “structural change” in American society.
As an example of this thinking, Johnson played clips from outgoing Prairie View A&M University President Ruth J. Simmons’s 2021 commencement speech at Harvard. As Brown University’s former president, Simmons — who will be joining Harvard’s administration as a senior adviser to the president on engagement with HBCUs — launched Brown’s landmark Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice, which studied the university’s ties to the transatlantic slave trade.
“She masterfully linked moral inquiry to the political imaginary with one assertion: The university — and nation as a whole, I might add — had violated human rights,” Johnson said of Simmons’ work on reparations.
Johnson connected Simmons’ model of thinking about reparations to the broader mission of his lecture.
“We have to conceptually rethink what it means to have conversations about our deeply held commitments,” Johnson said.
In concluding the event, Bartholomew, the associate dean of the Divinity School’s Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, thanked Johnson and noted that “this is not easy work.”
“The resounding message that I’m taking away from your presentation is our need to hold on to our capacity to dream,” Bartholomew said.
The Divinity School will continue its lecture series on March 6, with its fifth lecture, titled “Slavers and Slavery: A Dialogue with Descendants.”

It was 1:30 a.m. I was dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s of my pset - hi to my mom who is reading this - when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a small, brown fluff scurry across my Canaday carpet. Before I could even turn, the creature had disappeared into the dorm’s darkness.
My heart sank. It sank in the kind of way where every childhood mouse hero I had ever had, from Geronimo Stilton to Jerry, was suddenly repellent. That’s right, it sank in the kind of way where I became a Tom girl. Yet, most of all, it sank in the kind of way where I screamed.
“MOUSEEEE!” I hollered, awaking my roommates and thus embarking on our mouse-combating journey. Follow along below for (marginally) less screaming and (somewhat) successful strategies:
#1: Calling Securitas
As chaos descended upon my dorm, I felt like a soldier in battle. Every experience I had been through had been solely to prepare me for this moment. My reflexes kicked into action. I declared, “WE NEED TO CALL SOMEONE!”
My fingers flew to my phone as pride flooded me: I was protecting my home. I speed-dialed Securitas (a sign of someone who loves their Harvard community and/or regularly gets locked out). Securitas answered, I locked in:
“Hello! We have a mouse in our common room.”
[pause]
[faint laughter]
[stronger laughter]
“A mouse?!? What do you want me to do?! Come fight it?!”
Pride drained me. Even as I desperately flailed with, “You’re Securitas. Whatever strategy works best—,” I knew it was pointless. I was not a soldier in battle. I was a Harvard student who called security over a mouse.
Rating: 0/10
#2: Frantic Googling
Ah, Google. She has been there for me through everything. From the “what song am I thinking of?” crisis of Tuesday to the “how to not crave academic validation” crisis of later Tuesday, she has never steered me wrong.
So, once again, I turned to her: “how to combat a mouse.” And, once again, she had answers. Thousands. She broke down the difference between a rat and a mouse. She outlined the diseases I was more and less likely to contract from the mouse. And, just as my oh-so-brief attention span was waning, she provided me with a list of “Ways to Repel a Mouse.”
9/10
#3: Kill ‘em with Kindness Peppermint 
Five minutes later, I was nonchalantly explaining to my roommates, “the smell of peppermint repels them,” as I dumped an entire bottle of peppermint extract into my essential oil machine. Always an overachiever, I proceeded to douse every part of my room I thought a mouse might enjoy — which, recalling THAT scene in Ratatouille, meant drowning every inch.
As the last drop fell, I took a deep breath. The smell was intoxicating. Not in a seductive, holiday-esque way but in a if-I-can’t-breathe-the-mouse-can’t-either way. Which, I guess, is a win.
6/10
#4: Go to Sleep Believing in my Abilities 
Did not work. Never before had the springs of my bed squeaked that mouse-like. Never before had the moonlight produced shadows that rodent-y. While I had hoped the peppermint would soothe me to sleep, it served as a pungent reminder of the ro-demon that could re-emerge at any moment.
-10000/10
#5: Go to Sleep Gaslighting Myself Into Thinking I Made Up Seeing the Mouse 
10/10
Alas, despite my ratings, we shall never know which of these strategies proved the most or least effective. We have yet to see the mouse again. I live in a constant state of anxiety wondering, “Is the mouse still out there?”, or, worse, “If we never see the mouse again, will my roommates actually believe that I saw a mouse?”, or, the worst, “Did I see a mouse?” But, here I am writing this article, so it must be real. Right?
