After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It started out as a joke. Donald Trump for president? The guy who says “You’re fired” and is infamous for his hair? Sounds like an SNL skit. After a while—after it became clear that he was running to win—I asked myself, “Is he just trolling everyone? The Republicans? The Democrats? He can’t be serious when he says these things.” But say things he did, and continues to do: veterans, black people, Hispanic people, Asian people, disabled people, overweight people, Muslim people, women. Donald Trump has ridiculed and dehumanized just about every group in the country. 
And yet his poll numbers have continued to climb for months now, with recent numbers suggesting he is within 6 percentage points of Bernie Sanders and 3 percentage points of Hillary Clinton.  And all of this is done to the sound of the smug, self-satisfied laughter of our country’s elite, who continue to reassure themselves, “It will never happen.”
But it can happen. And the continued derision of our country’s progressives, particularly amongst the crucial constituency of millennial voters, is what is allowing it to happen. Before I came to Harvard, I grew up in rural Northeast Georgia, and as a result I am acutely aware of the fundamental emotional disconnect between our country’s upper tier and the average American. I realize that in an age defined by partisan newscasting, education disparities, and social media echo chambers, this country lacks mutual understanding. In the Harvard bubble, we do not truly get what causes our countrymen to speak, think, and live in the way that they do.  Because of this lack of understanding, we deride Trump as a joke, or label all Trump supporters as idiots, and, in turn, fail to recognize the legitimate concerns of America’s ailing middle class, leaving our nation critically vulnerable to Trump’s fascist campaign.
Outside of Harvard, many members of America’s formerly thriving middle class are furious. They are terrified.  They feel powerless in a society that was ruptured by the Recession of 2008, and in its economic reconstruction, they feel left behind. So, in looking for someone to blame, many have latched onto a figure who promises an end to the political establishment, with a campaign that harkens back to an age of national pride and, more than anything, economic security and optimism.  But what they have found is one of the greatest domestic threats to America in our nation’s history.
Something that has constantly shocked me at Harvard is just how insulated many of my classmates—particularly those who are from upper class urban and suburban backgrounds—were from the material and psychological impact of the Great Recession. See, my experience, like the experiences of millions of Americans from the easily derided, yet electorally crucial, “fly-over” regions of the U.S., was much more harrowing. I grew up in Gainesville, Georgia, a town that was ravaged by the Great Recession.
Home foreclosure signs dotted both sides of almost every street and highway, seemingly stable jobs and lifestyles vanished, money for our textbooks evaporated, marriages shattered, children turned to drugs, and lives fell into ruin. It affected everyone in my small town in some way. Budget cuts to Georgia public education led to furlough days, inability to purchase sufficient textbooks, layoffs, hiring freezes, and classrooms stuffed to the brim with students. Small businesses shut down in droves, leaving our town square, among many other areas of the town, utterly barren.
There is a sentiment in many of our nation’s middle class households that while the rest of America was suffering, the “establishment,” the political and corporate elite who arguably caused the financial crisis in the first place, avoided responsibility, either through explicitly illicit activity or through simple negligence. For many Americans, Trump, an apolitical figure, represents the strongest rejection of the “establishment,” that, in their minds, ruined their livelihoods.
I hope this article is wrong. I hope my friends and classmates are right—that Trump isn’t in any possible, conceivable way the threat that people seem to think that he is. After following this election closely, though, talking to friends from back home, and studying history, I am increasingly afraid of the threat that Donald Trump poses. I believe that he could win not because of his iconoclastic personality and hateful, racist rhetoric, but because citizens feel alienated from the political and economic processes of the post-Recession world, because fascism promises strength, and because people agree with Trump’s lofty goal to “Make America Great Again.”
In a period where everyone, especially our generation, is speaking into their own social media echo chamber, it terrifies me to think that millennials and increasingly our entire nation have been lulled into a state of apathy towards the political process. Politics matter, words matter, and hateful rhetoric to the cheer of millions matters. We must recognize where Trump’s voters are coming from, understand that some of the sources of their fear and anger are legitimate, and then, with this knowledge, wake up and fight back. It is time for us, as a nation, to recognize that Trump’s campaign is an affront to the idea of equality of opportunity for everyone, regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation, that we as a people are striving to obtain.
Trump represents a false sense of security who appeals to the most instinctual feelings of fear that turn us against our neighbors because of the color of their skin or the name that they use when they talk to God. Our generation of Americans has been blessed to have never lived under a figure whose words have promised so many chilling actions of hate and intolerance.  So my message to my friends from back home in Georgia and at Harvard, is to remind ourselves that we don’t have to have lived under Benito Mussolini or George Wallace to stand up united as a generation and a nation to declare, in one voice, “No.”

To the Editors of The Crimson:
To aid in the furious thinking going on in the administration for a name to replace "Master" of a House, I would like to propose a College competition to decide a suitable replacement.
To start things off, I will offer two possible new titles: "Marshmallow" and "Mouse." So as to avoid a sexual preference, both sexes should be content with the name "Co-Marshmallow" or "Co-Mouse." "Co-Marshmallow of Currier House," say, sounds pretty good.
Entries should be sent to an appropriate Dean.
Yours truly,Harvey Mansfield '53

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Are you… OK?”
Many of you have asked me this same question each time I have revealed my plans for a semester off.
The usual reply: “Yes, I’m totally fine—I just need some time away from Harvard” still applies, but maybe that answer’s just a little too neat. Yeah, I’m fine, but, at the same time, maybe I’m not. Maybe, just maybe, “being fine” is not where I (or you, for that matter) need to be right now. And, as John Bridger from the "Italian Job" tells us, “fine” really just stands for “Freaked out, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.”
So what I’m trying to tell you is that I didn’t decide to take time off, as many have assumed, because of any type of crisis. And, to avoid the wrath of the Jonathan Haidts of the world, I certainly wouldn’t want to be accused of catastrophizing.
As far as I can tell, I’ve had a pretty normal time at Harvard. It certainly came with my fair share of sophomore slump. But when the dust settled after year two—bringing with it a good deal more confidence in my “Harvard self” (apologies for the gag reflex)—I felt “fine” and pretty comfortable, at that.
“I’ve sort of got this Harvard-thing down,” I said to myself. And this seemed to be a real coup for someone who felt pretty lost just a few short months earlier. Importantly, many of my classmates don’t get to that place, from no fault of their own, as we are finally starting to talk about.
But along with my newfound ease came a new feeling—one that operated on a different plane than the disorientation of my sophomore year—a feeling that I couldn’t shake: I don’t think this is where I should be right now.
And here, I think, is the basis for that new dis-ease: There seemed to be a “Harvard path” on which I had finally found my footing. But the problems solved by finding that path—namely, shaking the feeling that I was lost in Harvard’s own Forbidden Forest—brought along with it a whole new set of angsty questions, like: Do I want to keep following this path to its end?
And what started to get me about the path was the neatness of it all—semesters, followed by summer internships, followed again by more of the same—a routine we all seem to follow quite diligently.
What they don’t tell you is that this routine is rigged. The path on which I had suddenly found myself was not my own existential, age-appropriate discovery. No, our school is “organizationally manufactur[ing]" our aspirations for certain careers. Or at the very least, our school tacitly approves of a system that allows a certain type of recruiting process to flourish, driving our choices in profound ways. But we all, at least to some degree, already know that, right?
And just like that, a whole new level of f'ed-up is added to our post-sophomore slump ease. Because if you “figured things out,” you actually just managed to stumble upon an already well-established, Harvard-approved, Ivy-League-certified path.
But this is not supposed to be some preachy piece (I can see you rolling your eyes) about what careers Harvard students should or shouldn’t pursue. I would be just as upset if Harvard was systematically attempting to churn out a legion of plumbers (well, actually, maybe not).
And, what’s more, I think a creeping awareness of this cognitive dissonance caused by the gap between our own actions and aspirations is what led some on our campus to get up-in-arms about the diversity placemats. “I don’t necessarily disagree with the content of the placemats; I just disagree with Harvard telling us how to think,” many of placemat-dissenters proclaimed. But sorry, that outrage was misplaced: When it comes to Harvard telling us how to think, diversity placemats are really not the problem. I promise.
To get to the point: the feeling that began to swell in me, prior to this last-minute decision to take a semester off, was an urge to disrupt it all. Because the effortlessness with which we all are able to follow this single path is, frankly, disturbing. And once aware of it, I needed—and the point of this piece is that I think some of you might need it as well—something a little bit more messy.
I can’t say what this disruptive messiness should look like for most of you. Maybe disruption happens for you with a change within the gates of Harvard. But beware: The Harvard bubble has obfuscating powers.
So, I’m off to New Orleans in search of a messier path (and believe me, I’ve certainly found something messy).
And hey, maybe I’ll come back to the “Harvard path.” Well, I probably won’t. But at least then, the decision will be my own.

The Cambridge Department of Public Works is putting the finishing touches on a public toilet that is set to open in Harvard Square in the coming weeks. The plans for the toilet, situated across from Johnston Gate in General MacArthur Park, were first approved two years ago, largely in response to lobbying on the part of a coalition of Harvard Square businesses, churches, and other organizations. According to a 2013 survey of Cambridge residents, workers, and visitors, Harvard Square is the neighborhood of Cambridge most in need of a public toilet.
We applaud Cambridge’s actions, since access to toilet facilities is a basic human right that should not be denied to any member of society. Many cities across the country have embraced this idea—in fact, the facility in Harvard Square is modeled after the Portland Loos, public restrooms in Portland, Ore. Though this marks a strong step, there is much more that Cambridge, Boston, and Harvard can do to help address the problem of homelessness in our community.
The current initiative will only provide a single toilet. The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and the newly-opened Y2Y Harvard Square shelter also provide toilets and showers. But because of their limited hours of operation, the full need for such necessities in the Square is much greater than what currently exists. This lack of access to basic facilities perpetuates the same social factors that keep the homeless unemployed and stigmatized.
We full-heartedly support the student groups who are working to help the homeless community in Harvard Square, including those at the two shelters. At the same time, the University should take a more active role in addressing this issue. The administration should consider making long-term investments so that Harvard Square’s homeless community can live with dignity. This is especially pertinent given the fact that economists would expect the presence of  Harvard to drive up rent prices in Cambridge and across the river in Allston, while remaining exempt from paying taxes on its property in the city due to its non-profit status. The statistics regarding the homeless in Cambridge—such as the fact that 45 percent of homeless adults have worked in the past 30 days—highlight the fact that Cambridge is simply unlivable for people working low wage jobs.
Cambridge and Boston must also do more to help combat rising homelessness in the area. There are a number of policy initiatives that have been tested in other cities, which have proven successful in reducing chronic homelessness. For example, the Housing First initiative has helped alleviate homelessness in places including Utah and Buffalo, N.Y. It is thus clear that steps should be taken to improve the conditions that the homeless face in Cambridge and Harvard Square. The public toilet in the Square is a step in the right direction.

Teaching fellows reacted positively to recommendations for a new General Education program, specifically applauding the proposal to decrease section sizes—a change some graduate students have campaigned for more than a year to achieve.
A recent report recommending an overhaul of the College’s core curriculum—which was dubbed “failing on a variety of fronts”—says that Gen Ed courses should have a target section size of 12 students with a cap of 14, offer additional pay and specialized training for teaching fellows, and provide  performance awards for top teaching fellows in the program.
The section size recommendation echoes the main goal of the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement of graduate students that has petitioned to cap section sizes at 12. Abigail Weil, a member of the campaign and a teaching fellow for a Russian language course, said she is pleased with the proposal. 
“I’ve seen my colleagues teach very popular Gen Ed courses…and they struggle,” Weil said. “My colleagues who are learning how to teach, learning how to grade papers, struggle to devote the requisite amount of attention to every student.”
Members of the committee that reviewed the program found that teaching fellows “face unique challenges due to the interdisciplinary quality of many Gen Ed courses.” Many teaching fellows said they struggle to prepare  for the courses they help teach.
John Gee, vice president of the Graduate Student Council, said teaching Gen Ed courses often requires additional training. However, Gen Ed teaching fellows often receive less support and fewer resources than graduate students who teach department classes, who have access to specialized workshops in the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
Gee, who has taught sections with 15 to 18 students, said he agrees with the committee’s suggestion for training Gen Ed teaching fellows.
“I think that [the report’s suggestions are] partly due to the conversation that the Harvard Teaching Campaign and the Graduate Student Council started around section sizes,” Gee said. “But I also think that it’s just generally an acknowledgment of the fact that it’s easier to teach better classes with smaller sections.”
Gee also said that, if implemented, smaller sections would enhance the program for both students and teachers.
“They want Gen Ed courses... to be more than throwaway courses, and to be things that people have an investment in,” Gee said.
Weil said that while small sections are more important to some disciplines such as the humanities, the target section size goal would benefit all undergraduates.
“Especially with the tuition that undergraduates are paying...they should be able to engage in small, seminar-style learning,” Weil said. “We would love to see [the section cap] instituted throughout the College, not only in Gen Ed.”

Students returning to campus after winter break were greeted by new flavored water machines in many of Harvard’s undergraduate dining halls.
The new drink choices are part of Harvard University Dining Services’ efforts to introduce more healthy options for students, according to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
"Building on our efforts to offer healthy choices for Harvard College students, we are adding Aquahealth machines to all residential dining halls over the next week,” Martin wrote in an email. “Aquahealth is filtered water flavored with fruits and, in some cases, enhanced with vitamins.”
In some Houses, the machines—which offer flavors like lemon and cucumber—were installed alongside existing still and sparkling water machines. 
Martin wrote that the lack of counter space in Pforzheimer led them to move the regular water machine to Cabot House, where it replaced the irreparable regular water machine. However, she added that Pforzheimer residents can still get plain filtered water from the soda machine.
Students for the most part welcomed the change to what is normally a staid choice.
"It makes me drink more water, since it’s more tempting to try the new flavors. From a health perspective, it’s a good thing,” Leah U. Rosen ’19 said.
Renee Friedman ’19 said she didn’t notice the change at first, but, upon seeing the new machine, said it was a good addition to the available beverage options.
"I think it's really neat that they're expanding and trying new things,” she said.
Some students were wary of the unfamiliar choices, but were still curious to try it nonetheless.
"I haven't tried it yet. I go for the regular water, since it’s more dependable for me,” said Lyra Wanzer ’19. “But I’m trying it this meal—look!"

UPDATED: January 27, 2016, at 11:15 a.m.
A crowd of about 100 students packed into a Sever classroom to attend the first lecture of  English 181A: “Asian American Literature”—one of the College's few courses in the field—indicating a rising popularity in the subject.
The increased interest comes after a semester of advocacy by students and faculty concerned with the College’s lack of Asian American studies offerings. Last October, the College formed an Asian American Studies Working Group, aimed at creating more opportunities for students and faculty interested in the field.
In addition, a group of undergraduates is pushing for more curricular offerings in Asian and Pacific Americans Studies. The group held a town hall in December to appeal to the Harvard administration to create a formal academic program in the area.
According to associate professor of English Ju Yon Kim, students have increasingly shown interest in her Asian American literature course over the past few years. When Kim first taught it in 2011, only seven students enrolled, she said. 
Jenny Choi ’16, a member of the group pushing for more Asian American course offerings, said she was excited to see interest in the Asian American literature class.
“I think these subsets of ethnic studies are not perspectives that are studied currently in our classes,” Choi said.
According to Tessa L. Desmond, coordinator for the Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights program, the College regularly offers about five courses in Asian American studies, a low number compared to other areas of ethnic studies, such as Latino studies.
“There really is interest," Desmond said. "What we have right now are broad introductory courses, and there’s interest in drilling down further."
According to Desmond, the working group set three goals at their meeting in October: to bring to Harvard off-campus scholars in the field, to present research, and to discuss current events.
“The main thing that the working group does is provide an environment where we can discuss both scholarly and… social involvements of Asian American studies,” Anita K. Y. Lo ’16, who is a member of the working group, said.
Last October, the group hosted Janelle Wong, a professor of Asian American studies from the University of Maryland, as a guest speaker. The group also held a thesis workshop for three seniors working on projects related to Asian American Studies, Desmond said.
This semester, the working group is planning to co-host an event with the Latino Studies Working Group. The event will feature Renee Tajima-Pena, a documentarian and scholar who has worked on issues relevant to both fields of study.
Desmond sees community-building, rather than curricular change, as the core purpose of the working group.
Ruodi Duan, the working group’s graduate student coordinator and a Ph.D candidate in History, said more offerings in Asian Americans studies could enrich Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum.
“I think it’s an under-taught and underspoken aspect of American history,” Duan said.

Though the fear of winter is ever-present for Cambridge’s homeless population, shelters, including the new student-run initiative Y2Y Harvard Square, aim to increase resources to mitigate the additional strains felt during winter months.
“It’s a dangerous world out here weather-wise. Brutally cold, you can lose fingers and toes,” said Alistair Finlay, who can often be found sitting at the intersection of Plympton Street and Massachusetts Avenue. “So you have to be very, very careful.”
According to the 2015 census, 464 homeless people live in Cambridge. With last winter’s record-breaking snowfall in mind, homeless advocates in Harvard Square are now fortifying against the cold.
Lily M. Velona ’18, one of the two advocacy directors at the shelter, said Y2Y is prepared for the months to come.
“We actually have— thanks to a lot of generous donations and forethought— well-stocked clothes, blankets, everything of that nature,” Velona said.
Though Y2Y normally provides a bed for 30 days to anyone who is selected in the lottery, one-night beds are also available. 
“We put in time, effort, and money to catalyze the community and open before winter really started,” said Samuel G. Greenberg ’14, one of the founders of Y2Y.
Since space in any shelter is not always guaranteed, especially in the winter months, some of Harvard Square's homeless population try to find other places where warmth is accessible.
“I go to Panera or the [Smith Campus Center] or the Bookstore to try and stay warm, any place I can get in and stay centered and warm and stay away from the elements,” Finlay said. “If you don’t get in the shelter, you pretty much have to gear up and bite the bullet.”
Micah S. Gellman ’17, who recently wrote and directed a play inspired by the local homeless population, remains in contact with some of the people he interviewed for his production.
“The homeless couple which I have been in touch with recently...are raising money to get a tent, better sleeping bags, and better coats for the winter," he said.
Gellman added that other people choose to leave the area and head west outside the region toward warmer climates.
Those who do stay in Cambridge, though, must find ways to withstand the winter.
“I try and stay positive in my mind, body, and spirit,” Finlay said.“This year has been hard for me to get my head around the weather.”
Y2Y is the nation’s first student-run youth homeless shelter. This winter will be the first that Y2Y will weather since its opening in November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-two applicants were chosen on Monday from a lottery pool of 386 to rent affordable housing units constructed in a residential and retail complex located on Harvard-owned land in Allston. 
The complex at the corner of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, now termed “Continuum,” was one of several projects included in Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan, which details the University’s development plans for the neighborhood. Approved in 2013 by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the IMP designated the site, originally called “the Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons,” as a town center connecting local residents and Harvard affiliates in Allston. The BRA is Boston’s urban planning agency.
Though the 42 units in Continuum were offered to renters in a lottery, the BRA wrote in a December community announcement that minimum income limits would apply, and that preference would be given to Boston residents. In addition, the maximum income for the units was capped at 70 percent of Boston-area median income—$48,250 for a one-person household and $55,150 for a two-person household.
Developers hired SEB, a Brighton-based consulting firm specializing in affordable housing, to facilitate the lottery process. The company had distributed more than 1,300 applications by Dec. 22, according to SEB vice president Brian Engler. Only 386 were eligible for the units, he said.
The BRA’s requirement that any residential development of 10 or more units offer a certain percentage of those units at below-market prices is an “essential” regulation, Engler said.
“If you don’t have some component that is available to households who aren’t upper-income, then you do ruin the fabric of communities,” he said. “It’s essential for communities to have households, families, from all different income types in order to really be sustainable and viable.”
The BRA also wrote that rent for studio apartments would be set at $1,068 per month, subject to BRA change, with increasing rates for each additional bedroom. In 2011, median gross rent for Allston households with bedrooms was estimated at $1,424, according to American Community Survey data.
During planning, Allston residents emphasized the importance of creating a vibrant, livable space for locals alongside Harvard’s institutional facilities in the area.
In an unprecedented move, Harvard chose to include Allstonians in the search for a developer to construct Continuum. The Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory board to the BRA comprised partly of local residents, contributed two Allstonians to the seven-person search committee, which selected developer Samuels & Associates in 2012.
“The idea that the community had involvement throughout the process was central to the project’s success,”  Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said.
Harvard and city officials broke ground on Continuum in late 2013, and SEB began distributing applications for affordable housing units in early December 2015. The company assisted with marketing and tenant selection, according to Engler.
Continuum is not Harvard’s first foray into Allston housing developments. In 2013, many residents of the Charlesview apartment complex next to Harvard Business School relocated to a new site on Western Ave. following a 2007 land swap between the Charlesview owners and the University. The old complex was later demolished.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each semester, hundreds of students shop one of professor Shaye J.D. Cohen’s General Education courses on the Hebrew Bible, enticed by the possibility of fulfilling a requirement while taking an easy class.
Cohen’s courses have in the past received low workload and difficulty scores on the Q guide, Harvard’s course evaluation metric. And with 417 undergraduates enrolled in his Culture and Belief course last spring, Cohen’s class was one of the most popular Gen Ed courses offered.
Cohen, who chairs the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations department, says both the course’s difficulty and its size are by design, not by accident.
Exposing hundreds of students to his discipline is important for Cohen. And he said that “rigorous demands” for coursework likely would deter students from enrolling. But there is an additional factor in Cohen’s calculus: graduate student funding.
According to a report on the Gen Ed program released last spring, some professors in the Arts and Humanities division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have an incentive to teach larger Gen Ed courses in order to support their Ph.D. candidates—whose stipend primarily comes from teaching. Many departments in that division, including NELC, have relatively few undergraduate concentrators and require Gen Ed courses to create more teaching positions.
For Cohen, not offering large Gen Ed courses could mean his graduate students “would all go hungry” for lack of teaching positions.
Ph.D. candidates in the Arts and Humanities receive stipend support for their first two years at Harvard, during which they ordinarily do not teach. According to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann P. Hall, graduate students in their third and fourth years are generally paid by the Office of Undergraduate Education to teach courses, with an additional GSAS stipend that keeps overall financial support consistent with levels from their first two years. Teaching assignments are tied to undergraduate course enrollment—the larger the course, the more sections and teaching positions offered.
Cohen said he finds the current funding model problematic: In small departments that have large numbers of graduate students relative to their undergraduate populations, doctoral candidates have to look elsewhere for teaching appointments. Cohen suggested that the graduate students should be guaranteed a fixed value of funding from GSAS for a fixed number of years, with the expectation that students would still teach for one to three years during their time at Harvard.
“Every graduate student needs to learn how to teach, every graduate student needs experience in teaching, and every graduate student[’s training] should include a teaching component,” Cohen added. “You fix that, that will take off a lot of the pressure on the problems of the Gen Ed curriculum, which will allow the Gen Ed curriculum to just be discussed on its own.”
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, who sits on the committee reviewing the Gen Ed program, said the current expectation that graduate students teach in their third and fourth years did not “map well” onto the structure of the History department, where candidates spend their fourth year researching off-campus. After that time, Jasanoff suggested these candidates should receive guaranteed teaching fellowships for an additional year.
FAS will likely vote on a new General Education program later this semester—the current program, the review committee found, was “failing on a variety of fronts.”  Among the committee’s recommendations are a reduced target section size of 12 students and a cap of 14, supplemental pay for Gen Ed teaching fellows, and additional benefits for departments that supply faculty to Gen Ed courses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team has been a constant for me over the past two years as a Crimson sports writer. I covered it all of sophomore year and the team made it to the national championship game. I went abroad junior fall, but back on campus the wins continued. Now I am back in Cambridge and a similar situation faces the Crimson as the one when I left.
However, this weekend is a crucial turning point in the season looking at where the team has been this year and how the rest of it will pan out. Harvard is facing off against Quinnipiac and Princeton, with both teams ranked in the top ten at fourth and ninth, respectively.
The Crimson did not make the top-ten cut, which is one difference between the position the team is in this weekend and the one it found itself in during the 2014-2015 national championship campaign.
Last year at this time the Quinnipiac-Princeton weekend was also a big stage setter for Harvard’s post season run. Coming into the weekend ranked fourth in the nation last season, the Crimson pulled off an overtime win against the Bobcats and dropped a 1-0 decision to the Tigers. Beating a Quinnipiac team that was ranked in the top five at the time gave Harvard the momentum to go on and win its next six games, three of them against ranked opponents.
The snowball effect continued on to foster Harvard’s winning streak, which resulted in a national championship berth. It was admittedly fun to watch and fun to cover a team that was constantly winning.
The team needs this kind of momentum during these upcoming weekend games to come out of the series with renewed energy and confidence as it moves forward into the tough part of this 2015-2016 schedule. Coming off of a win against Dartmouth has already started to push the team in the right direction, but it will be Friday and Saturday’s matches against some of the stronger ECAC teams that will show whether or not Harvard has what it takes to make a legitimate run at the national title once again.
The win over the Big Green snapped the end of a three game skid, during which the Crimson was shut out twice. Beginning both Friday and Saturday’s games with a strong offensive push in order to set the tone on home ice is extremely important, as the offensive pressure has been lacking in the opening five minutes of the past two matchups.
Persistent injuries have been a common theme for the team since returning from the break, which has forced head coach Katey Stone to play around with the lineup and skating lines more than she has had to in the past.
The lack of synchrony among the lines has resulted in an increase in turnovers, which have been costly to the team in games against ranked opponents. Getting the puck deep into the opponent’s’ zone and minimizing turnovers on the blue line are aspects of Harvard’s game that need to stay constant this weekend against teams that will find ways to capitalize on any and all mistakes.
Yet the Crimson is familiar with this weekend’s foes. This will be the second weekend series played against Quinnipiac and Princeton this season, having previously faced off against both on the visitor’s side of the ice the weekend of Dec. 4 and 5. Both games resulted in 2-1 overtime losses, results that Harvard is eager to avenge in the upcoming faceoff.
Following this weekend series Harvard is set to face off against top ranked Boston College in the Beanpot, a team that the Crimson has seen regularly throughout the past two years. Currently, the Eagles are on a 27-game win streak. They have not lost a single contest since a playoff defeat by the Crimson last year.
Harvard versus BC games are always tough match ups; fun to watch and fun to cover. I have seen my fair share of upsets and losses between the rivalry just in these past two years of covering the team.
Both teams always bring their A-game, giving the Crimson even more of an incentive to win this weekend’s match ups against Quinnipiac and Princeton to go into the first round Beanpot game against BC with momentum.
The Eagles have been sitting atop the national standings for quite some time with their undefeated record, just as they were when Harvard pulled off a 3-2 victory in last year’s Beanpot.
The Crimson has 120 minutes of ice time between now and then, here’s to the repeat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a weekend which saw members of the Crimson’s second line, not its usual first, announced as starters on consecutive nights, Harvard men’s hockey coach Ted Donato ’91 was quick to remind reporters what no one needed reminding of: “Whatever line Jimmy Vesey’s on is going to be our first line.”
But if there’s anything the second line’s presence proved over the course of the No. 7/7 Crimson’s latest two-game slate, it’s that Donato might have  finally found a unit worth sticking with.
Just in time for Friday night’s rematch of the 2015 ECAC championship game against Colgate, Harvard (11-4-3, 7-3-2 ECAC) rolled out the same second-line combination it went with in Lake Placid—junior Luke Esposito on the left wing, junior Sean Malone at center, and senior Colin Blackwell on the right.
And this time—nearly 200 miles farther south—the move paid off yet again.
At Starr Rink in Hamilton, N.Y., Malone opened the scoring; then Blackwell set up co-captain Kyle Criscuolo for the eventual game-winning goal, carrying the Crimson to a 4-2 win.
One night later at a hostile Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y., Blackwell was at it again, scoring the game’s first goal and assisting sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman on another, bringing about a 6-2 victory over then-No. 10/10 Cornell.
“With the way Sean was going and the way Colin Blackwell was going, it really makes us a much more dangerous team,” said Donato on Friday after the Colgate game.
With a goal and three assists over the weekend, Blackwell—The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week—earned his first four-point weekend since 2012, when he logged four assists in the ECAC tournament semifinals against none other than the rival Big Red. The San Jose Sharks draft selection now has 13 points in 12 games so far in the 2014-2015 campaign, good for fourth on the team.
Blackwell has only skated on the second line this season, but the fifth-year senior missed six consecutive games from November to December, forcing Donato’s hand as he rotated through various line pairings throughout the winter.
Esposito and freshman forward Ryan Donato received significant time on the wings, while junior center Tyler Moy and rookies Michael Floodstrand and Lewis Zerter-Gossage made spot appearances, but few combinations lasted very long.
This weekend, however, with Malone jumping up a unit to join Esposito and Blackwell, the second line was flying high in New York. The trio finished with seven points (3 G, 4 A) in the Crimson’s sweep of the Raiders and the Big Red.
“We feed off each other really well,” Blackwell said. “We played with each other last year, and we complemented each other really well. We’re really good friends off the ice too...and I think we’re all very similar players.”
“The way we play is we kind of get pucks in deep to down their defensemen,” he added. “Then eventually with our speed and being able to protect the puck down low, once we wear them down, that’s when we can take advantage.”
That’s exactly how Blackwell found Sherman in Ithaca, to produce the goal that put Saturday night’s contest out of reach.
Holding the puck deep in the corner, the senior suddenly burst up the boards, leaving a defenseman in the dust as he fed Sherman at the point. Then the 6’7” sophomore came through, blasting a one-timer past Cornell goaltender Mitch Gillam to put Harvard up 4-2.
Blackwell, whose five-year tenure with the Crimson has largely been hindered by injuries, has now played in eight straight games—a stretch that began with the Mariucci Classic in Minneapolis.
The senior logged a goal and an assist at the tournament, afterwards revealing that he was finally feeling healthy.
“I feel good right now,” said Blackwell after Harvard’s title-clinching victory over Minnesota on Jan. 2. “I had three weeks [during break] to go on my own, and skate, and get back into shape. I feel like I’m in really good shape, but it’s just a matter of game shape. That takes a little bit of time.”
Now over three weeks removed from the mid-season tournament, Blackwell looks as sharp as ever. Donato revealed after the game on Saturday that he is more than pleased with the recent strides that the senior has made.
“It’s good to see that he’s back playing the game that he loves and he’s very good at,” Donato said. “He’s a guy that elevates his game under the spotlight, so we’re happy to have him back…. He’s a big part of our team—when he gets going, he gives us an X-factor.”
Blackwell will look to provide that offensive X-factor once again Friday night, when the Crimson returns to action at its home rink against Princeton. And for the first time in a long time, Harvard’s  second line looks to be set.

Remember last September, when seemingly the entire student body was added to the Hcha-survey mailing list? And then, seemingly the entire student body replied all asking to be taken off?
Well, it’s a new year, and thus a new semester...time for another Reply-All fiasco to sweep across campus. As if we weren’t already drowning in shopping-week related emails.
Enter “Harvard Leads 2016,” the bot responsible for the approximately 10,000 unread emails and counting in your inbox. And while you would think that Harvard students would have learned to turn the other cheek and not tell literally everyone at the school that they would like to be taken off the list, please (us too!), that is evidently not the case.
Some of the best additions to the thread include a thumbnail photo of our fearless leader Drew Faust, a one “M Dildo”’s confession that he or she “definitely want[s] to be on this mailing list,” all 10 anonymous “Harvard Leads” who just replied with the word “same,” and the brave Fetty Wap impersonator who chimed in with the opening lines to “Trap Queen.”
However long this latest scourge lasts, we at Flyby suggest either doing your best to ignore it or replying all with your best jokes. Never a bad time to test out material for the day you finally decide you’re funny enough for stand-up. (Spoiler alert: you never will be). And just consider, while it is a mild annoyance, when has the entire student body ever been interacting at once like this? Take notes on inclusive (virtual) social spaces, Dean Khurana.

Harvard students are...not the brightest sometimes. You would think that some of the sharpest minds in the world would be able to figure out how to remove themselves from a mailing list without disturbing the thousands of other poor souls still trapped on the list. Unfortunately, as we have seen today with Harvard Leads 2016, this is an unrealistic expectation.
Here are some examples of what not to do:
1. Reply-all with the subject line: “Please take me off this mailing list.”
And thus the floodgates were opened. Thanks for nothing!

2. Try to make friends with other people.
This is what Tinder and Bumble were invented for. While we applaud your gregarious nature, we do not appreciate all the notifications you are giving us in your quest for friendship.

3. Be the lone voice of reason...and get ignored immediately.
Congratulations, you just told everyone to not respond all to a mailing list by responding all to said mailing list. 

4. Try to be funny or cute.
Just stop.

5. Respond “same” or “take me off this mailing list” a thousand times.
Do you realize you are talking to a bot? Please understand that bots are busy entities that are too busy tormenting humans to appease your simple request.
Instead of doing any of the above, why not click unsubscribe or create a Gmail filter? Simply open one of the emails, select “Filter messages like these,” click “Create filter with this search,” and then click “Delete.” Problem solved!
You’re welcome.
