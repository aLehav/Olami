After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is nothing unique or novel that I can say about the Las Vegas shootings. I can only be one more voice mourning the loss of so many lives in so senseless of a tragedy.
My beloved home state of Colorado has seen far too many similar events. From Columbine and Arapahoe High Schools to an Aurora theater, our state feels even more deeply the pain inflicted across the nation by mass shootings. This violence has exacted a high toll on many members of the Colorado community, and while buildings can be reopened and memorials built, long-term emotional pain is not always as obvious nor easily confronted.
Yet as is often the case in the wake of great tragedy, there have been numerous examples of great hope and unity in the aftermath. I’ve watched neighbors and friends stand shoulder to shoulder at candlelight vigils, hold each other kneeling on the ground, and refuse to let violence divide or separate them.
I have seen firsthand the power of “thoughts and prayers” to bring a community together. You don’t have to be particularly religious to grasp an idea of how telling someone “I’m thinking of you” and “I’m praying for you” is unbelievably powerful.
Even if we could not be there in a moment of crisis or tragedy with somebody, “thoughts and prayers” fundamentally orient our heart to theirs, our soul to their suffering, our mind to their pain. When we say we’re thinking and praying for someone, even just for a moment, we are saying, “I see you. I know you are hurting. I am there with you.” While I could write much about prayer specifically, I will say that prayer is also a powerful yearning, an aching groan that things are not as they should be.
Yet for some commentators, “thoughts and prayers” are simply empty signals at best, and shrugging off apparent political obligation at worst. Those cynical commentators claim that thoughts and prayers don’t stop the next one. We should be fixing the problem and—for gosh sake—doing something.
In fairness, those impulses aren’t completely without merit. When we genuinely empathize with someone’s pain, there is a natural and understandable impulse to do whatever we can to take their pain away. If we truly commit our heart and mind to feeling for someone, we do take on a responsibility and obligation to help them in real and practical ways. We should not skirt this new work. Thoughts and prayers change us, and then we change things.
But we can’t just jump to that second step. If our first reaction to someone’s loss is to immediately seek action, we haven’t really empathized with them at all. If our first reaction is a “game plan” or “resources,” we’ve looked completely past the humanity of someone who is hurting. If our first response is demanding legislation, then all we’ve done is misplace our faith in a political system that will never answer.
And sometimes, it’s nice to see that some of our politicians take a second not to see American citizens as constituents to be bought and sold or crises as opportunities to be exploited, but take even the briefest of seconds to empathize as a human being and say, “my prayers are with you.”
This isn’t to say that there isn’t a worthwhile debate to be had about gun control or other policy measures regarding American gun violence. But does it really have to happen mere hours after families and friends experience unspeakable tragedy? Do we really have to jump to making quips about silencers and assault rifles and the Second Amendment and the National Rifle Association so soon after?
“Thoughts and prayers” allow us to share in another’s pain and compel us to help lift them up. We meet people where they are, in their darkest and despairing moments, and we don’t leave them there alone. It is a fundamentally human response to tragedy that should never be condemned.

Freshman year had yet to start and I had already been mistaken for a laborer by a Harvard employee.
My roommate and I were picking up a couch that his older sister had left in a House on the river. We walked into the quiet courtyard and found the building manager’s office, since we had to have the storage room unlocked. I stood beside my white roommate as he spoke to the building manager. After my roommate had chatted with him a while, the building manager finally decided to acknowledge my presence.
“I see you brought a laborer.”
The words stung. As my mind worked to process the weight of his statement, the building manager followed up with a second question.
“Or is he the roommate?”
His first impulse was to assert that I was not a Harvard student, yet it was easy to assume that my white roommate was. I couldn’t help but feel that I was being seen as nothing more than the rich melanin in my skin.
But it was freshman year. I had yet to attend my first class so I tried to shrug it off. After all, Cambridge is a liberal bubble and people at Harvard are educated, so there was no way that I, a boy from a middle-class suburb, had just faced racism.
What I did not realize in this optimistic naiveté was that I had, in fact, encountered racism. And more disturbingly, that this racism would be neither the abnormality nor a rogue anecdote in my Harvard experience.
I have made it into this elite institution, fulfilling the dreams of parents who immigrated from El Salvador in search of more than they’d had. But, like the wings of an encaged bird, even these hopes can be clipped.
As a Latino at Harvard, I struggle every day to find a place in an institution that was not built for me. But I am far from the first to struggle. The systemic marginalization of Latinx students is a central, albeit forgotten, part of Harvard’s history.
A HISTORY OF LATINX MARGINALIZATION
Nearly 300 years after this institution opened, Latinx students were finally emerging as a presence on campus. In 1974, Harvard and Radcliffe boasted a joint enrollment number of 6,286 students. The 50 Latinx students enrolled represented less than 1 percent of their population, versus the nation’s 4 percent. Being few in number subjected them to reductive stereotypes and racial transgressions.
In 1976, the Harvard chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity advertised a mixer with a caricature of “Brother Chico,” an overplayed Mexican stereotype. Chicano students said it “symboliz[ed] the prevailing attitude towards Chicanos at Harvard and the society Harvard represents.” Mexican American students, who made up the majority of Latinx students at the University at the time, were subject to the derivative stereotypes that continue to depict Latinx communities today: uneducated, lazy, and a foreign threat to American values. Harvard’s reputation as a world leader in education failed to shield its Latinx students from the ignorance of their peers.
While at Harvard, Efrain Cortes ’94, a Puerto Rican from the Bronx, was told by a peer that he “thought everything that came out of that area, from Puerto Ricans, was cocaine and crime.” Without a second thought, Cortes was associated with a rhetoric that dehumanizes Latinx communities by viewing them as nothing more but vessels for crime, drugs, and social plagues—even though some of the most famous cocaine incidents occurred along Mt. Auburn St., not Latinx students’ dorm rooms.
In 1997, Harvard University Dining Services was waiting on a campus-wide vote to see if they’d reintroduce grapes into the dining halls. HUDS hadn’t served grapes for 13 years because of multiple nationwide boycotts meant to address the inhumane labor conditions workers faced in cultivating them. The debate quickly became personal when a white student verbally harassed one of his Latinx classmates as he copied fliers that supported continuing the boycott.
During the altercation, the assailant made the racist and false assumption that the parents of Edgar Saldivar ’99 were migrant grape farmers. The experience was deeply insulting, prompting Saldivar write an email where he expressed how this interaction racially victimized him. The assailant refused to see the racial implications of his comments, sparking a heated email exchange between the Harvard-Radcliffe Republican Association and RAZA, Harvard’s Mexican-American student group.
During his freshman year, a student mistook Jesse G. Sanchez ’14 for one of his classmates’ Phillips Brooks House Association mentee from Boston. Though the story was recounted in a Crimson article about struggles low-income students face at Harvard, it’s clear that his classmates’ mistake was a racially influenced transgression. The presence of Latinx students at Harvard is so unexpected that the go-to explanation for a brown student on campus was that he must have come from a struggling Boston neighborhood.
Each of these conflicts reveal the insidious tendency for Harvard students, especially those who are white, to stereotype their Latinx classmates. The history presented above is only a small glimpse of a larger, institutional problem. All admitted Harvard students are promised an equitable educational experience, but these stories of racial marginalization (and the many more that go untold) undercut that promise.
For Latinx students at Harvard, racism is not just a thing of the past—it’s a part of their present and, inevitably, their future. When the news broke that incoming freshmen had made jokes about hanging Mexican children, it wasn’t shocking. And even though those particular students were rescinded, there are students currently enrolled at Harvard who would have laughed at the joke or made it themselves. From the micro- to the macro-, racial aggressions are the price Latinx Harvard students pay to attend an institution founded on whiteness.
EXAMINING ASSUMPTIONS
History shows us where we’ve been, but it can also offer insight into where we should go. The first lesson, and subsequent area for improvement, is in peer-to-peer interactions. Administrators must focus on what’s making some of the peer-to-peer interactions between Latinx students and their classmates a jarring experience. Racism may operate systematically, but people of color experience it as individuals in a visceral way.
When a white student comes to Harvard from an all-white high school, he doesn’t have a starting point for interacting with actual Latinx people. Subconsciously, these people structure their interactions on the media portrayals of Latinx people, where they are one-dimensional: criminals, labor sector workers, or entertainers. The natural reaction is to then fit their Latinx classmates into shallow caricatures.
When freshmen enroll, the University has a couple of opportunities to address these biases before they snowball into blatant acts of racial harassment. The first is through the readings assigned for Community Conversations, a program meant to “examine your assumptions and learn about your peers’ diverse identities and perspectives.”
When I was an incoming freshman, we were assigned Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s autobiography. By pretty much all standards, that was the perfect book for incoming freshmen to understand what the Latinx experience at the Ivy League can be like, especially when one is also a low income, first-generation student. The problem, though, as I heartbreakingly realized, was that too many people did not read the book at all. If they did, they only read a short section that did not catch the nuances needed to foster true empathy.
Luckily, Community Conversations have begun to address this issue by assigning shorter personal essays and a TED Talk instead of a memoir. The assigned readings now read like personal essays, and they’re written by current Harvard students. This is critically important given that students of color have the best insight into their own experiences.
Moving forward, it’s important that the authors chosen to write these pieces are diverse, along as many axis as possible, and that they offer a critical perspective on Harvard. Latinx students have plenty of positive, rewarding experiences, but assigning fluffy, easily digestible narratives will be of little benefit to incoming freshmen. Instead, the College must present raw, honest, and critical views to incoming freshman to ensure that arriving students don’t mistake Harvard for some sort of racial utopia.
The second solution to bettering interracial interactions on campus is to add nuance to the way the College markets the idea that Harvard is the place to learn from peers who are dramatically different from us. This is a noble endeavor, and one of the biggest benefits from having a diverse student body. But in pursuing this mission, there are inequities that are not being addressed:
Latinx students carry a larger burden in interracial exchanges. They compose less than 12 percent of the admitted student body, so any individual Latinx student will have to share their distinct experience much more often than any given white student would. The experiences Latinx students share—sometimes concerned with experiences of racism, xenophobia, or poverty—can be difficult or tiring to repeat.
No one should have an obligation to such taxing exchanges, and the way administrators feed us the idea that we should learn from our peers does not address this. Moving forward, we should continue trying to build empathy through the sharing of personal narratives, but the College should explicitly acknowledge the inequity of its emotional toll.  If not, Latinx students will continue to feel compelled to “educate” their peers, even at the cost of their own emotional health.
THE NEED FOR LATINX STUDIES
There’s also a need to address issues of race via the classroom. Personal interactions are an effective way of allowing people to understand the complexities of Latinx communities, but they're not the only way.
Diversifying course material across Harvard is a highly effective method. Through countless academic and literary texts, students can break down stereotypes, understand histories of immigration, and grasp other staples of the Latinx experience in the United States. If professors make an effort to diversify their reading lists, they can help educate non-Latinx Harvard students, taking a bit of that burden off Latinx students. A bit more Junot Díaz in our English classes and Gloria Anzaldúa in our history classes can go a long way.
In addition to diversifying syllabi and course material, Harvard must also begin investing in establishing a full Latinx Studies program. For more than four decades, students and professors have advocated for Latinx Studies offerings at Harvard but have faced numerous obstacles, including egregious administrative shutdowns from former University President Lawrence H. Summers. Because of Summers’s decisions, Harvard lost critical Latinx Studies scholars and the exodus gutted any potential growth in a program, leading to what is present on campus today—a mere skeleton of Latinx Studies.
Currently, students can pursue a secondary in Latinx Studies from the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights or choose to study Latinx Studies as a subfield in the newly created Ethnic Studies track within History and Literature. However, these tracks are incomparable to a dedicated department, offering only a handful of professors with training in Latinx Studies and course offerings that differ wildly from year to year.
Harvard is not a leader in the field of Latinx Studies, and that hurts students directly. Without a robust Latinx Studies programs there is little chance that students will learn about the important role and place of Latinos in the United States. A lucky few may stumble across a Latinx Studies course, currently hidden in the Romance Languages and Literatures or History departments, but the vast majority will not. Simply put, racial tensions on campus are worse because of our academic failings.
Once we have the course offerings, we need to ensure that students will be encouraged to take the courses. The General Education program is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that students take classes that fall outside of their concentration. It is also one way to expose students to classes that will help them better understand their Latinx peers.
Many schools, including Cornell, University of Massachusetts Boston, and University of Colorado Boulder, have diversity requirements for graduation. The College missed a crucial opportunity during its recent General Education overhaul by failing to add such a requirement. The previous General Education structure required one of the eight General Education courses to “engage substantially with the study of the past.” The diversity requirement could function similarly under the new requirements. A new diversity requirement would encourage students to take courses focusing on the Latinx experience to fulfill their “Aesthetics & Culture” or “Histories, Societies, Individuals” General Education requirements.
The need for Latinx Studies is two-fold. First, its glaring absence delegitimizes Harvard’s claim as a global leader in education. Secondly, the lack of an academic program places the burden of explaining the histories and experiences of Latinx students entirely on the Latinx student body. Formal avenues by which to learn would help make peer-to-peer interactions easier and less emotionally exhausting. Pushing for Latinx Studies at Harvard is an issue of student belonging as much as it it is an educational issue.
THE HARVARD LATINX OF TOMORROW
Latinx students at Harvard often carry a burden that their white counterparts do not. While the problem is not unique to Harvard (Latinx students throughout the Ivy League understand this burden), it does manifest itself in a way that is specific to Harvard. Our traditions, the way we frame diversity, and our unique lack of resources puts us behind peer institutions that may be more hospitable for Latinx students.
Lilia Fernandez ’95 once told a Crimson reporter that, “A lot of people just say, ‘I should have gone to Stanford or UCLA.’” Twenty-four years later, Latinx Harvard students utter those same phrases as they dream of warmer, more supportive campuses.
The Harvard Latinx of then and of now are not as different as one might expect. The Harvard Latinx of tomorrow won’t be either, unless Harvard University commits to making their experience as equitable as possible.

Last week was a life-changing one for Sunil Amrith, a History and South Asian Studies Professor.
Not only did he welcome his second child into the world—Amrith also won a prestigious MacArthur “Genius” Grant.
Each year the MacArthur Foundation awards 24 unrestricted $625,000 fellowships “to talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction.”
Amrith said he was shocked to receive a phone call notifying him that he had won the grant, as he had no idea he had even been nominated. “It was truly, completely… out of nowhere,” he said.
Amrith joined the Harvard faculty three years ago after teaching modern Asian history at the Birkbeck College of the University of London for eight years.  His research focuses on the history of migration in South Asia, as well as its modern political implications.
“The big themes of my work are movement and migration, and what happens if we actually put migrants at the center of the histories that we write instead of taking national boundaries for granted,” Amrith said.
Though his research centers on immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries, Amrith said he is interested in studying parallels between the movement of people in the past and in today’s current political climate.
The author of two books, Amrith said he will use the grant money to “speak to a wider audience” about his research. The money will also enable him to begin to tackle some of his “dream projects,” like working with a documentary filmmaker or travelling in China to expand the scope of his scholarship, he said.
Amrith said he was inspired by the other MacArthur Genius fellows’ wide range of specialties. Other fellows named this year include novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen, journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and MIT computer scientist Regina Barzilay.
“There are people I would love to meet; you know, there are very very interesting creative people—artists, novelists, you know—I would love to see what kinds of opportunities, collaborations come out of that,” Amrith said.
Amrith already knows one of his fellow Genius recipients, historian Derek Peterson—they started their first jobs at the University of Cambridge together 13 years ago.
Despite the breadth of Amrith’s extensive research, he also described the sense of fulfillment he feels from teaching his students.
“I’m learning as much from my students as they are from me when it comes to the history of South Asian communities here in the US, and that’s been exciting,” he said. “It’s coming back here and being in the classroom that brings it all together for me, as well as hopefully for the students that are taking my courses.”

Steel magnate Lakshmi N. Mittal and his family donated $25 million to establish an endowment at Harvard’s South Asia Institute, retitling the institute in his namesake.
Founded in 2003 to further the University’s engagement with South Asia, the institute works with faculty and students through interdisciplinary programs to advance teaching and research on issues relevant to the region.
“International centers like the South Asia Institute at Harvard University serve as a vital conduit between the University and the world we study,” University President Drew G. Faust said to the Harvard-run Gazette. “The generous support from the Mittal family is a testament to both the important work being done by this community of scholars and students and the continuing impact it will have in the region.”
In a statement to the Gazette, Mittal said he believes Harvard is one of the world’s greatest learning institutions with a unique ability to ensure the long-term prosperity of his native India and its neighboring countries.
Mittal is the chair and CEO of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel company, and has no prior affiliation with Harvard.
The South Asia Institute focuses on scholarship pertaining to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tibet, and diaspora populations from these countries.
Both the Business School and the School of Public Health have centers in Mumbai, India, and the South Asia Institute plans to open an office in Delhi, India this year.

Professors and experts discussed the role an intergovernmental organization has played in shaping political, economic and social development in Southeast Asia as part of a Harvard University Asia Center conference on Friday.
The event, held to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is one of several initiatives to bring greater awareness of Southeast Asia to Harvard, said Jay K. Rosengard, a senior advisor at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia, who co-organized the conference.
“Harvard normally thinks about Asia stopping at the Southern border of China,” Rosengard said. “Southeast Asia kind of gets lost. So [we’re] using the fiftieth anniversary of ASEAN as a way to highlight the importance of this region and elevate its profile at Harvard.”
The conference, dubbed “ASEAN @50: Achievements and Challenges in Southeast Asia,” featured a lecture from Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, and two panel discussions. Panelists analyzed the triumphs and difficulties of ASEAN, a regional organization founded in 1967 to integrate the countries of Southeast Asia and bring development to the region.
Rosengard, who organized a panel on “Peace and Prosperity,” said he selected panelists with a goal of creating a “diversity of perspective in terms of areas of expertise” as well as a balance of “practitioners versus academics.” Both panels included professors and specialists in fields such as finance and public health, and panelists came from countries all over Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.
Doreen Lee, a panelist and associate professor of anthropology and sociology at Northeastern University, said ASEAN has been successful in driving economic growth but believes the organization has neglected humanitarian issues such as the drug war in the Philippines and the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.
“The traditional ASEAN policy of non-interference in member states’ domestic affairs creates a strange absence of political discourse at the regional level, even though many of the issues I’ve mentioned constitute national and human rights crises,” Lee said. “Peace has come at the expense of justice and prosperity is widening inequality.”
The event attracted a similarly diverse audience. Yuqing Li, a visiting fellow from Tsinghua University in Beijing, said she attended because she thought the topics of discussion were relevant to her Thai Studies major.
Andre Prawira Putra, an Indonesian student at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he believes ASEAN could help countries such as Indonesia address systemic problems too large for a single government to handle.
The conference was held in conjunction with an appearance from Surin Pitsuwan, ASEAN’s former Secretary-General. On Thursday, Pitsuwan spoke at the Asia Center’s 12th Tsai Lecture, an annual event which brings “notable academics, government officials, business leaders” to Harvard each year, according to the Asia Center’s website.
Harvard has also launched three different professorships of Southeast Asian studies and created language programs for Thai and Indonesian, said Rosengard.
“There’s been a general movement across the University to try to increase our capacity to do serious scholarship in Southeast Asia,” he said.

Speakers at the 4th annual Harvard-UCLA Food Law and Policy Conference on Friday criticized the current food regulatory environment, arguing that it stifles innovation and encourages excessive food waste.
The day-long conference, held this past Friday, featured four panels and a total of 18 experts representing law firms, animal welfare advocacy groups, regional government agencies, and entrepreneurs in the food industry. The panelists explored what the “next frontier” of the food industry could look like.
The first panel, titled “Keys to Survival as an Innovator in the Food Regulatory System,” discussed how current food regulation policies deter small businesses from entering the food industry because lawyers increasingly file class-action lawsuits against them.
“The number of class actions filed regarding food labelling went from under 20 in 2008 to over 425 active cases in federal court in 2015 and 2016,” said panelist Diana R. H. Winters, assistant director of scholarship at the University of California, Los Angeles’ Resnick Center for Food Law and Policy.
“Are consumers getting less willing to put up with deception in the marketplace? Or are these cases driven by a small group of plaintiff lawyers who are no longer making money from tobacco class actions?” Winters asked her audience.
Jeremy Halpern, partner at the law firm Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP, agreed with Winters’ assertion, adding that the growing demands for food information have had a detrimental impact on the industry.
“There is a tension between sufficient information to make good choices and driving people to this place where no amount of information is over-information,” Halpern said. “We are in a strange environment now because much of the regulation that was intended to drive consumer information, to drive people's ability to choose wisely, is now actually inhibiting their ability to get better food.”
Another panel, emphasized the urgency of altering worldwide meat consumption habits. Bruce G. Friedrich, executive director of the Good Food Institute, cited a 2015 report by Chatham House that claims that world  governments will not meet their obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement unless meat consumption goes down.
“Meat production is extremely inefficient,” Michael Selden, CEO of Finless Foods, said. “The worst way possible to make a hamburger is to use a cow.”
Solutions panelists proposed to stem environmentally-unsustainable meat-consumption trends included healthier plant-based alternatives and “clean meat,” which is slaughter-free meat produced by replicating animal fibers.
“In 2013, we made 10,000 of these fibers this way and we created a hamburger, cooked it, and ate it,” said Mark J. Post, professor of physiology at Maastricht University in The Netherlands. “That was the first example of this, which shows that the technology is there and there is good reason to do it—environmental, food security, animal welfare.”
The final panel, “Disclosure, Health & Safety in the Regulatory Jungle,” highlighted the difficulty the restaurant business faced in upholding “healthier” standards while still satisfying consumer taste.
Michael S. Kaufman ’75, a principal and partner at Astor Capital, expanded upon this issue.
“When people are told something is healthy, there is this sense from the customer that, ‘Well, I’m here to be indulgent, I’m here to have a good time. I don’t want to be restricted by what’s good for me,’” he said.
Attendee Christopher G. Van Gundy, a partner at Keller and Heckman LLP, gave positive reviews of his experience.
“I thought it was really forward thinking. I know both of the organizers and I view them as thought leaders,” he said. “I really have changed the ways I view the food world from this.”

The Undergraduate Council expressed “disappointment” with Harvard’s response to the Deptartment of Education’s changing federal Title IX guidelines.
Last month, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced changes to gender equity law Title IX, saying that universities may now abandon a “preponderance of evidence” standard—or the lowest standard of proof—when judging whether an accused student is guilty of sexual assault. Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga said last month that Harvard is “reviewing” that guidance.
“The safety and well-being of our community remains the University’s top priority,” deLuzuriaga added at the time. Title IX administrators have also previously said that they do not plan on altering Harvard's Title IX policies because of changes to federal standards. 
At their general meeting Sunday, UC representatives voted overwhelmingly to pass a statement supporting Harvard’s victims of sexual assault, adding that Harvard should “go above and beyond federal minimum standards in protecting survivors’ access to this unique and transformative education.”
“We, the elected representatives of the Harvard student body, firmly believe that the safety and well-being of students are top priorities of the Harvard community, and therefore express our disappointment in the Administration’s failure to officially announce its decision regarding Secretary DeVos’s letter,” the statement reads.
The Council also passed a “Dorm-Rooms to Table” pilot program Sunday, in which students can apply to go out for meals in Harvard Square with others selected at random.
“The whole point about the dinner is it’s people you don’t know,” said UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18.
The pilot program will likely start this semester with a lottery for 120 students. It utilizes the UC’s Burst Fund, which offers UC members and committees twenty “packs” of $3,000 to jumpstart initiatives that benefit the College’s student body.
Sachee said previous programs and plans to increase social life inspired “Dorm-Rooms to Table.” In previous years, the UC sponsored “community dinners” in Harvard Square where groups of students were paired together for meals.
Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 suggested a friendly amendment to limit the number of meals per student at one per semester. Afterwards, Winthrop House representative Henry S. Atkins ’20 proposed a amendment restricting Council members from using the program.
“We have a situation where we’re going to be able to fund dinners for about 120 separate students on this campus. If we only help 120 students with an initiative, then none of those should be us,” he said.
Both the amendment and the legislation itself passed.
Also, at the meeting, the Grant for an Open Harvard Campus funded $600 for Southerners Organizing Urgent Transformation Through Harvard College’s inaugural event. SOUTTH, an unrecognized student group, will bring Jackson, Mississippi first lady Ebony Lumumba to speak.

In the wake of scandals, controversies, and a department-wide culture review, Harvard’s Athletics Department has formulated a response: a series of no fewer than five mandatory trainings and programs.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise discussed the initiatives during an interview Thursday, also reflecting on the department’s tumultuous past academic year, which Scalise called “the best of times and the worst of times.”
“The graduating class graduated with more Ivy championships than any other class,” Scalise said. “But we had the issue with the soccer team, the cross country team, we had some faculty members suggesting that we had gotten out of balance with our cross country program, we had some folks from the rugby team talk about the gender imbalance, we had a coach that basically was upset because of the [Equity in Athletics Data Analysis] reporting.”
The new programs will include mandatory sexual assault prevention and conflict resolution trainings for athletes and department staff, as well as an unconscious bias training for staff and coaches. The department will also engage in “diversity dialogues” in January in addition to “Giving Voice to Values,” an event held in August to “align the values of the College, the department and each individual team together.”
Last October, The Crimson reported that members of the 2012 varsity men’s soccer team had produced and circulated a sexually-explicit “scouting report” about members of the women’s team. After an Office of General Counsel review revealed that the practice was an annual tradition that had continued with the 2016 team, Harvard canceled the remainder of the team’s season.
“The real issue with some of the behavior of some of our kids last year is that those are the seeds of very bad behavior, very bad behavior, very, very awful behavior that could happen later on and that’s why it was important for us to take a stand,” Scalise said on Thursday.
When he first saw the “scouting report” last October, Scalise declined to comment on whether its negative impact went beyond “tak[ing] away from the potential for creating the kind of learning environment that we’d like to have here at Harvard.”
“I don’t have a comment on that right now. I have to think about it a little,” Scalise said at the time. “We need a little bit of time to just think about it and not rush to anything.”
Now, after a cultural review that the department undertook last spring with consultants from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in response to the “scouting report” and other departmental controversies, Scalise said the department is taking action.
Beginning this month, student athletes will participate in a gender and sexual harassment training that the department redesigned with Harvard’s Title IX Office and the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. The training will emphasize bystander intervention strategies more than in previous years, Scalise said.
“I’m excited that it’s going to be something that is mandatory for all of our teams every year, and it’s also encouraging that the NCAA has basically seen this as an issue and said all NCAA Division I athletes have to have this training as well,” Scalise said.
Scalise said the cultural review also revealed a disconnect between the department’s mission of “Education through Athletics” and practices on the ground.
“One of the things we learned is that my message, the message that we talk about, goes to various people but somehow it stopped and it didn’t get down into the organization.” Scalise said. “I addressed it with the students at their eligibility meeting this year and I talk about it when I meet with the captains, so I’m doing more in talking directly to the students.”
The unconscious bias training for staff and coaches will start in November with a full roll-out scheduled for Spring 2018. Additionally, the department's new conflict resolution program will begin in December with the help of Harvard’s office of human resources. Athletics will also partner with Harvard’s Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion to host “diversity dialogues” with staff and students in January.
Alongside this host of new trainings, the Athletics Department has also made changes to its complaints process. Scalise has been meeting with teams and captains to explain the internal and external channels available to students who wish to raise concerns. The department also included information about the complaints process and confidential resources  in the student handbook this year.
Last spring, internal divisions in the women’s cross country program resulted in the departure of a controversial coach. At the same time, members of the women’s rugby program voiced concerns about Athletics’ compliance with Title IX and unequal compensation between coaches of men’s and women’s teams.
A separate review of how Harvard compensates its coaching staff that began last spring is still ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors and researchers from across the country delivered interdisciplinary talks on problems of inequality at the first-ever Inequality in America Symposium held at Loeb House on Friday.
This year’s conference featured four sessions altogether, all aimed at addressing inequality in a variety of sectors, including employment, healthcare, immigration, and civil rights. Each session tackled a different theme within a range of inequalities.
The first symposium session focused on “Governance, Citizenship and Social Justice,” and addressed systemic power imbalances that often generate inequality. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a sociologist whose work studies inequality in the workplace, attended the first symposium.
Khurana said his scholarship motivated him to attend Friday’s event, adding he is currently writing a book about how globalization and class hierarchies reproduce income and other social inequalities.
“Working on areas of how inequality operates in labor markets and through institutions is something that I do my scholarly work on,” he said.
Scholars discussed inequality in the workplace and in the family during the second session, where professors argued that social mobility is often limited by generational factors and the family that one is born into.
In the last two sessions, professors discussed inequality stemming from opportunity gaps in science, technology, education, and health care. One researcher, for example, spoke about a gender bias in STEM fields.
University of California Hastings School of Law professor Joan Williams said she observed patterns of racial and gender discrimination in her work. She found that black women in science, harboring a double minority status, are typically at a disadvantage.
“One woman had had an eraser thrown at her by a colleague who said, ‘Maybe now you’ll understand,’” Williams said, discussing findings from one of her studies.
In the final symposium session, professors discussed “mobility and migration,” and how inequalities from around the world can be replicated within U.S. borders.
Claudine Gay, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Dean of Social Sciences who organized the symposium, said the event is the start of a larger initiative to jumpstart more scholarship and collaboration on social issues. She added that FAS will start a post-doctoral program in this field next year.
“The initiative itself covers a range of different themes, and we’re trying to offer a snapshot of all those themes,” Gay said. “The idea here is to bring in more scholars who are primarily concentrating in inequality, and have them join our community, and maybe also catalyze new research by joining us in various collaborations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike his predecessor, Harvard’s new associate dean for diversity and inclusion Roland S. Davis will not help develop or negotiate the College’s year-old sanctions on members of single-gender campus social groups.
The penalties, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships. In the run-up to the sanctions’ debut in May 2016, Emelyn A. dela Peña—the diversity dean prior to Davis—worked closely with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to formulate the social group policy.
 But Davis, who was officially named diversity dean in August and started work Oct. 2, said in an interview Saturday that he does not plan to be involved with the social group penalties.
“Neither Dean Khurana nor [Dean of Students Katherine G.] O’Dair have said anything to me with regard to any of the social group issues or the implementation of sanctions—I haven’t had a single conversation about it,” he said. “As far as I know, my job at present will not be involved in any of that.”
“Unless I’m specifically asked by someone—Dean O’Dair or Dean Khurana—my focus will be singular and it will be on issues related to diversity, inclusion, and belonging,” Davis added.
He said he does not think the College’s attempts to regulate undergraduate social life are “central” to these issues. Administrators’ rationale for the social group policy has shifted over time; most recently, a Harvard committee claimed the sanctions are meant to combat discrimination on campus.
In the interview Saturday, Davis also detailed his priorities as he takes office and his plan of action for the next six months. He said he intends to spend time meeting with students, faculty, and staff and listening to their concerns.
Davis said he has already met with several groups in the roughly two weeks since he arrived in Cambridge, including staffers in the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and members of a College working group for undocumented students.
Davis said he thinks conversations like these will help him figure out how to improve diversity on Harvard’s campus. He added it would be “ridiculously arrogant” to start work and automatically assume he knows “what is needed.”
Davis also said he would be interested in helping out with the University’s ongoing search for its next president, though he said no one has asked him to get involved to date. University President Drew G. Faust announced over the summer that she plans to step down in June 2018.
Since Faust’s announcement, Harvard has mobilized to find the University’s next president: members of the presidential search committee met numerous times over the summer to discuss the process and the qualities they’ll look for in potential candidates.
More recently, several alumni groups including the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance and the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard sent the committee letters urging them to consider a diverse swath of candidates and to prioritize individuals from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Davis said he thinks these calls for diversity are “a good idea.”
“I would love to be involved [with the search],” he said. “If asked, I would absolutely serve in whatever capacity I was asked to serve.”
In the immediate, though, Davis said he wants to focus on students. He urged undergraduates to get in touch via email or stop by his new office in University Hall.
“Anything and everything boils down to the students for me,” he said. “Please stop on by. The more I get to know students, the easier my job will be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing off against Middlebury, Seton Hall, and the University of Rhode Island, over the weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team dominated its opponents across the board at home in the Beren Tennis Center during the Harvard Fall Scramble. They were most certainly not scrambled, as clean, crisp play owned the day, and the squad ended winning all three of its weekend bouts.
“I felt like we played some quality tennis,” freshman Neha Gupta said. “The best part was how we ramped up our energy and level of play each match. Even more so than dominating the competition it felt great to be able to apply what we were working on in practice in our matches.”
In the face of all of this, the Crimson squad still had time to give back to the local community during the heat of competition. According to sophomore Lexi Milunovich, hosting a clinic at the venue provided a moment of respite for the team.
“One of the highlights [of the weekend] was giving a mini clinic at Sportsmen's to kids during our rain delay on Saturday,” Milunovich said.
Playing without sophomore Jenna Friedel and captain Annika Ringblom due to injury for the first two days of the event, Harvard (3-0, 0-0 Ivy League) needed its younger players to step up in their first dual matches of them season. And step up they did. In its first two matches against the Rams (1-4, 0-0 Atlantic 10) and the Pirates (2-1, 0-0 Big East), Harvard finished 11-1 in singles and 4-2 in doubles.
Sophomore Irene Lu suffered the squad’s lone singles defeat in the first two days, 7-5, 6-1, while playing at the top position against URI sophomore Mihaela Codreanu. Sophomore Natasha Gonzalez, Gupta, and freshman Anna Li each tallied two victories in the format over the period with Gonzalez and Gupta’s wins both coming in straight sets. Lu won her remaining two matches to close out the weekend with a winning record.
Coming off an event in the Yale Bulldog invite, in which its singles performance was middling at best, Harvard produced a particularly promising result against the Pirates on Saturday. Each of the six matches were two-set sweeps in its favor and no Seton Hall player mustered more than three games in any of the twelve sets.
Doubles was not as dominant a format for the Crimson, as fellow sophomores Lu and Milunovich were the only players to triumph against Seton Hall, 6-3. Harvard, however, went undefeated against the Rams the day prior with three routine victories, 6-3, 6-1, and 6-2.
Continuing her unbeaten singles streak with three wins over the weekend, Gupta improved to 8-0 to begin her Crimson career.  The Elk Grove, Calif. native credits her recent string of success to her consistent focus and supportive teammates.
“The college game is definitely faster, both in its scoring and the pace of the rallies, so I've really had to work on my footwork and ability to focus for every point,” Gupta said. “You definitely have to devote a lot of time to the team, so it's a good thing I can every single girl is fantastic, super fun, welcoming, and supportive. I couldn't think of negatives if I tried.”
With Friedel and Ringblom back in the line-up on Sunday against the Panthers, Harvard continued to roll. Ringblom blanked Panthers junior Molly Paradies, 6-0, 6-0, while Gonzalez, Gupta, Lu, and junior Erica Oosterhout also picked up wins against their respective Middlebury competitors. Even with Milunovich retiring by injury in her singles match, the Crimson went 9-1 across singles and doubles with its captain back in action.
“Annika [Ringblom] closed out the weekend really strong with a 6-0, 6-0 victory,” Gonzalez said. “Her positive presence on and off court always helps to bring up the team.”
With only two more events remaining on the fall calendar, Harvard looks to continue its strong play heading into ITA regionals in Philadelphia, Pa. next week and the spring season ahead.
“The fall is all about building for the spring,” Gonzalez said. “We got some good matches this past weekend that will help us get sharper for the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Split between coasts for a big weekend of racing, the Harvard cross country women and men separated to race in the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational and the Princeton Invitational. In both races, freshman led the way with Abbe Goldstein pacing the Harvard women in Wisconsin and Hugo Milner carrying the men’s team in New Jersey.
WISCONSIN INVITATIONAL
Competing at the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational against many of the top schools and runners in the country, Goldstein completing the course in 21:22.3 less than two minutes off the winning time. Coming in 107th out of the 225 athletes racing, Goldstein led Harvard to 33rd place overall in one of the most competitive Division I cross-country meets of the regular season.
Freshman Anna Juul finished next for Harvard in 188th with a time of 22.14.2. Crossing the finish right behind Juul was sophomore Gillian Meeks. Seniors Fiona Davis and captain Elianna Shwayder rounded out Harvard’s top five runners.
PRINCETON INVITATIONAL
Closer to home, several Harvard men competed against 21 other schools and over 200 runners at the the Princeton Invitational at the West Windsor Fields. Harvard finished in 13th place overall, improving from last year’s 18th place result.
Newcomer Milner was Harvard’s top finisher of the day, completing the 8K course in 24:20.9 and coming in 9th place, the best result of all freshman runners in the event.
“The last few weeks I have been working very hard in training and the result yesterday justified my efforts,” Milner said. “I am pleased with the result and proud of my teammates, although there is still a lot more work to be done in order to continue the success.”
Coming to Harvard from Derby, U.K., Milner has made an impressive transition to collegiate running and has already made an incredible impact on the men’s team.
“The mowed grass and flat course of Princeton is typically a different style of Cross-Country that I am used to, as being from England I am familiar with hilly and muddy races,” Milner said. “Being an international student it takes time to adjust to the US collegiate system and racing against a range of abilities. I turn up to races to have fun and compete, whilst I am sometimes unsure on the quality of the field, I always give my best.”
Junior Collin Price who was Harvard’s top runner last year was the second scorer. Finishing with a PR of  24:54, Price came in 45th place. Rounding out the scoring for Harvard, two more freshman placed in the top-five for Harvard. Freshmen Matthew Pereira and Michael Alber were Harvard’s third and fourth finishers, coming in 64th and 95th overall respectively. Senior Louis Colson also scored for Harvard, crossing the finish in with a time of 25:49.5 and securing 107h place.
“The race was definitely an improvement from our last race at Beantown, at least for most of the guys,” Price said. “I was able to get a pr yesterday, which was an improvement, but I wasn’t super pleased with my race. We’ve definitely got a lot of room to improve for HEPs in two weeks, but we are on the right track.”
At the Princeton Invitational, Harvard women’s cross country freshman, Tessa Medrano, ran as an individual and finished in 78th overall in the women's 6k with a time of 23:19.4
Both Harvard teams will race next in Van Cortlandt Park in New York City at the Ivy League Cross Country Heptagonal Championships on October 27th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Last weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team split its doubleheader, beating Penn and falling to Princeton. This week saw another split series.
Coming off a strong performance on Friday against Brown, the Crimson (10-6, 5-2 Ivy League) was unable to withstand the conference-leading Yale (12-4, 6-1).
The Bulldogs’ victory over Harvard was its fourth straight win, which allowed Yale to carry a one-game Ancient Eight lead heading into next weekend. The Crimson currently sits in third place.
YALE 3, HARVARD 1
Like Friday’s performance against Brown, the contest started off with a neck-and-neck battle. Sloppy play from the Crimson in the second set gave the Bulldogs a lead, leading to two Yale kills to give the set to the Bulldogs 25-19.
Despite finishing with two more kills than Yale overall, Harvard was plagued by mistakes, including four attack errors and three attack errors in the first set.
The second set appeared as it would again in the Bulldogs direction, as the visitors initiated an early 13-7 lead. However, the Crimson reversed the momentum of the set, going on an impressive offensive streak to bring the set to a 21-17 score.
A balanced attack in that second set run featured kills by freshman hitter Mindie Mabry, junior hitter Jocelyn Meyer, and junior co-captain Christina Cornelius. Harvard would seal the set 25-22.
In set three, Yale jumped out to an early 9-4 lead, forcing the Crimson to call its first timeout. Despite narrowing the deficit to one point at 11-10, Yale broke away and earned an 18-13 lead. Harvard was unable to find the energy to even the score, and the Bulldogs took the set 25-19.
In the fourth and final set, the Crimson withstood the aggressive Yale attack early on in the frame, but a 12-2 run by the Bulldogs in the middle of the set was simply too much for Harvard to claw back from. The Crimson brought the score back to 21-17, but could not withstand consecutive kills from freshman hitter Kathryn Attar to conclude the set and game.
“We showed a lot of strength and kept fighting and firing at them,” sophomore setter Erin McCarthy said. “There are a lot of things we can improve on and we will go back to the gym and work hard.”
Freshman outsider hitter Evelyn Gray made her season debut in the contest, logging three blocks and one kill. In a noticeable emphasis on younger players, the team featured all four of its freshman in this match.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
The Crimson recovered from a first-set loss and defeated the Bears in four sets, earning its fifth Ivy win of the season on Friday.
Harvard was spearheaded by three main offensive weapons on Friday night: Cornelius, Mabry, and Roberts Burbank. Combining for a total of 40 kills, the three players had attack percentages over .320 and contributed 45 points out of 70 total points in the contest.
Junior blocker Jocelyn Meyer also had an impressive night serving the ball, breaking through the Brown defense with three aces. Meyer currently leads the team with 20 aces for the season, with the Crimson having tallied 36 aces so far in conference play.
The strength of the two teams were virtually inseparable in the first set, going back and forth through the 10s and 20s. Harvard held the lead at 21-19, but four kills and two Crimson errors ultimately gave Brown the first set victory.
Set two was a completely different narrative. After earning 13 points, the Bears fell victim to an unstoppable Crimson offense for the remainder of the set. Harvard delivered eight of the nine final points in the set, cruising to a 25-14 set victory. The .467 hitting percentage and 17 team kills in set two were both game-highs for the Crimson.
The third and fourth sets followed along the lines of the second set, as Harvard edged out Brown by a score of 25-20 in set three and 25-21 in set four.
The team finished with a kill percentage of 0.311 and 68 team digs, while totaling 58 kills.
“We really played as a team and our chemistry is what helped us win,” Cornelius said. “ We got our passes down, Erin[McCarthy] was able to give me some really good balls, and I was able to find some open spots on the court.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Sometimes it’s not the score line, but the expectations, that determine the end result.
For Harvard men’s soccer, playing to a 1-1 tie against Brown Saturday night at Jordan Field, this rang true. Looking to pick up a second win in conference play, Harvard (2-7-3, 1-1-1 Ivy League) hoped for a system win against a traditionally lesser opponent. Instead, upstart Brown (6-3-2, 1-1-1) brought a chippy, untidy game and a tying goal to leave the Crimson licking its lips at the missed opportunity.
In Ivy League soccer, there is no conference tournament and each regular season game carries added weight. For perennial contenders such as Harvard, who look to win the conference title and make the NCAA tournament, missed opportunities can mean missing games. That’s why a loss to a non-conference opponent can leave the team positive (see last Tuesday against Boston College), while a hard-fought draw can sting long after winter sets in. The Crimson is playing for its season, just much earlier in its schedule.
Not surprisingly, Harvard found that pressure early in its first home Ivy League matchup. The team was eager to avenge last weekend’s away loss to Cornell.
“The first ten, fifteen minutes were very tense,” said defender and co-captain Justin Crichlow. “Everyone was really tense on the field. Then we settled in and got to playing and we really took advantage of our ability to play possession.”
The Crimson was first to snap out of its daze and play through the haze—a thick fog accented the levity of the game while occasionally obscuring vision—in the 21st minute. Points leader (7) and sophomore forward Philip Hausen converted a penetrating pass from freshman midfielder Sebastian Lindner-Liaw (who coincidentally recorded his first collegiate point).
“I saw that Sebastian got the ball in the middle,” Hausen said. “I knew I had space out wide so I just slowed my run down and then called for the ball. He saw me, and I took my first touch inside and finished with my right foot.”
Harvard came soon after with more pressure as it looked to tack on an insurance goal. The time looked to come with 15 minutes left in the first half as a save by Brown’s senior goalkeeper Joey Cipicchio turned into a juicy rebound and a point-blank shot. But a Brown player was able to block the shot and keep the Providence, R.I. team in the game.
Brown responded before halftime as a long throw-in from senior midfielder Quinn English into the Crimson’s penalty box was brought down by junior defender Jack Hagstrom, who was able to fire off a shot in the goalmouth scramble to level the score.
“Unfortunately, they were better on set pieces today,” Crichlow said. “We’ve just got to work on that this week in practice and hopefully play better when we play Princeton next.
The goal proved to be an important turning point as the game slowed down in the second half. Hagstrom, an All-Ivy member last year, led the Brown defense as the two teams battled for possession. The two teams only put two shots on net, respectively, in the second half.
“Towards the end, we started to let them dictate the game, which is letting it bounce, having it being somewhat of a chippy game, looking for a lot of balls in the air,” Hausen said.
This led to Brown getting the better of the chances in the second regulation period. Brown whizzed a pair of shots right over the crossbar and fed crosses into the box. It took a sprawling senior goalkeeper Kyle Parks and back post clearance by Crichlow to prevent easy tap-ins and preserve the tie.
The push by Brown lasted into overtime when Harvard’s defense had to respond with its own goal line clearance. Still, the Crimson looked for chances and was successful in injecting the ball into dangerous areas. But the opportunities never materialized and the team walked off the field disappointed.
“We wanted to get into their wide spaces and go at their outside backs,” Crichlow said. “We wanted to overload, get our outside backs around, and get into some 2 v 1 situations. And we did that pretty well. But it’s just unfortunate that we weren’t able to get more than one goal tonight. I think we had it in us, but it just never came together.”
Luckily for Harvard, a Columbia tie against Princeton this weekend means that the Crimson still controls its destiny regarding its post-season hopes, just three points back from the conference-leading Lions and Big Green. But the team knows that it will have to perform better in the coming games, else disappointment will turn into despair.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After junior forward Kathleen Young suffered an injury in last week’s game against Boston College, Harvard Field Hockey knew that it would be facing a challenge going forward. Traveling to Ithaca this weekend, the Crimson had to quickly adapt to life without its leading scorer. In a highly contested game, Harvard (10-3; 4-0 Ivy) eventually overcame the Big Red (7-4; 1-3) 4-3 thanks to an overtime goal.
In what has become the norm this season, the Crimson began the game with a relentless attack on Cornell’s goal. This plan resulted in an early goal, as freshman midfielder Tessel Huibregsten collected the ball in the 3rd minute and fired her shot into the net.
Harvard didn’t need to wait long to get back on the scoresheet. In the 10th minute, sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen fired a shot which was deflected by a Cornell defender. However, freshman forward Natalie Sicher recovered the deflection and fired off her own shot for the score. The goal was Sicher’s first of her career with the Crimson.
Facing a 2-0 deficit early on, Cornell knew that it needed to respond soon before the game got out of reach. In the 23rd minute, the Big Red scored its first goal of the game, as Grace Royer brought her team within 1. Both teams traded shots to end the half, but neither was able to score before the whistle blew.
Harvard opened the second half just as in the first, with a flurry of shots on net. After firing two shots on net, freshman Mimi Tarrant managed to score her first goal of the game in the 41st minute. After seeing one of her shots blocked by the Cornell goalkeeper, Tarrant quickly reacted to grab her miss and shoot again, this time into the back of the net. Her goal extended the lead to 3-1 and, for the moment, seemed to put the game out of reach for the Big Red.
Cornell, however, had other plans in mind. In the next 16 minutes of game time, Cornell managed to tie the game at 3-3. Just 8 minutes after Tarrant’s goal, Cornell pulled the game back to within one, as the team scored off of a penalty corner. In the 57th minute, Cornell senior Krysten Mayers stole the ball, raced into the circle, and fired her shot past senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup to even the game. With this goal, Mayers tied the Cornell record for career points and goals with 94 and 40, respectively.
In the waning minutes of regulation play, each team found itself with multiple chances to score, yet neither was able to get the decisive goal. In an overtime period that saw more fouls (4) than shots (2), Harvard ultimately triumphed with its goal in the 75th minute. Following a series of fouls by both teams, junior midfielder Emily Duarte shot the ball on net, but saw her attempt saved by the Cornell goalkeeper. However, Tarrant, just as she had earlier in the game, collected the rebound off the save and tucked her shot behind the goalkeeper to seal the game.
Following this week’s action, Harvard keeps its focus on Ivy league play as it returns home for a much anticipated matchup against Princeton. The Tigers, also undefeated in Ivy league play following an 11-1 victory at Brown, will be Harvard’s main competition in its quest for another Ivy League title.
