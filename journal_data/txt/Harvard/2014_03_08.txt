After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Electro-pop band Metronomy’s latest album, “Love Letters,” features diverse, playful music and the band’s wide vocal and tonal range, which makes it hard to pinpoint the album’s sound. These shifts in tone startle listeners and elicit the question: What kind of sick game is going on here? It is evidently geared toward making the listener acutely and delightfully uncomfortable, perhaps sinking the listener into the washed-out scene of a bizarre English dramedy about painfully awkward young lovers. Lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Joseph Mount, who founded Metronomy as a side project in 1999 after having had stints with various other small bands that were all torn apart by his ex-girlfriends, is certainly no stranger to the trials and tribulations of romance.
 
While Metronomy’s first three albums lacked both cohesiveness and consistency, “Love Letters” maintains a surreal and nervously desperate tone and theme. The songs all deal with the similar topics of romance, unrequited love, and communication issues. However, the band’s instrumental and vocal approach to the album’s theme varies in each song, and so do their results.
 
Diversity is both a strength and weakness for Metronomy, as some of their songs are much more texturally and lyrically rich than others. Opening track “The Upsetter” begins with Mount howling over a simple, unimposing beat. While the band has the musical talent to let their instruments do all of the work, the opening track is more about establishing the main recurring voice of the album—a desperate lover with a message for his beloved that he wants to beam to her over satellites. Then we get a bizarre voice that may be a man’s and may be a woman’s—we only know that, in the context of the song, it must be the other’s response. A nostalgic guitar riff comes in towards the end of the song, the plethora of sounds and voices comes to a close, and the tone of this wild ride is set.
 
In contrast to the bland instrumentals and vocals of tracks like “The Most Immaculate Haircut,” an eerie synthesizer opens “Monstrous” and continues muted for the entirety of the song as the rhyme and steady metrical pattern of the lyrics hit the mark beautifully. Mount sings, “Hold on tight to everything you love / Honestly it’s all that I care about,” and it sticks in the listener’s ear. But even this grows old as the insecurity of the song becomes palpable in the rigidly imposed structure of the desperate lyrics.
 
Metronomy asserts its musical prowess in opening many of the songs. such as “Boy Racers” and the titular “Love Letters,” with lengthy instrumentals that make the vocals feel unwelcome. Though not the highlight of the album, the vocals are certainly intriguing. As the content of the “love letters” is sometimes self-indulgent but often endearing, this is a mostly positive ambivalence. The persistent discomfort at this messy Pollock-like splatter of emotion, highlighted in tracks such as “Love Letters,” adds to the profound experience of the album. This amalgam of love letters that make up the album can be awkward, melancholic, and timid but remains interesting rather than frustrating, beautiful rather than cliché.

“The tickets sold out before the box office even opened on Tuesday,” Abigail W.T.A. Mariam ’15 says. Mariam, who is the publicity liaison for the “I, Too, Am Harvard,” is excited that so much press has been generated around the production’s publicity campaign. BuzzFeed picked up the media campaign—pictures of African-American Harvard students holding signs that call out racial prejudice—only a day or so after the production’s own Tumblr campaign was launched, according to Mariam.
 
With all the fanfare that has been generated around the production’s media push, the topic and format of the show that will run only once—March 7 at 7pm in Lowell Lecture Hall—has been kept a secret.
 
Haven M. Jones ’15, who was interviewed for the project, says she was initially not even sure who is in the cast. These interviews were collected over the past year and turned into a narrative about what it means to be black at Harvard.  “As someone on Kuumba board, you’d think that we’d have some sort of inside scoop on the play,” Jones says. “But we didn’t even know who was in the cast until the Facebook picture for the show came out.”
 
Despite the anonymity, students have been working on this production for many months. Assistant director and script editor Paige R. Woods ’16 says it was events last year that inspired Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, the play’s writer and director, to put this show together. The conversations that began after last year’s Crimson editorial questioning affirmative action (http://www.thecrimson.com/column/the-snollygoster/article/2012/11/2/Siskind-affirmative-action/) along with other discussions of race on campus that made her Matsuda-Lawrence think more deeply about blackness on campus.
 
 “Kuumba was really the space for [Matsuda-Lawrence] to develop her ideas,” Mariam says. Though “I, Too, Am Harvard” seems to have taken on a life of its own—Matsuda-Lawrence even made the creation of the script an independent project for her fall semester, according to Woods—it is only one part of Kuumba’s 16th Annual Black Arts Festival. Other events include Kuumba’s Artist-of-the-Year Showcase with Joshua Bennett, an open mic, and a Soulful Sounds jazz performance right after the production.
 
The only mystery left is what the performance will look like on stage. The only thing Mariam reveals is that that cast members will play multiple characters and that the presentation is in the form of dramatic monologues. “It’s anything but a standard structure,” Mariam says.
 
“I have no idea what it’s going to look like,” Jones says. “But somehow my story is in it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a week in which the Crimson women’s basketball team overcame early deficits to improve their record to 19-7 by beating Cornell and Columbia, head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith set her own records from the sidelines.
After 32 years at Harvard, Delaney-Smith won her 514th game on Saturday night, tying former Princeton men’s coach Pete Carril for the most wins by an Ivy League basketball coach.
“I’m very proud of that record, but it’s secondary to so many other things,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think Harvard is a school that does it right; the balance of athletics and academics is philosophically what I believe in.”
Perhaps the milestone Delaney-Smith has reached can be attributed to her own diligence, and the motivation her leadership provides the team. Delaney-Smith will have a chance to break the record this Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion against Yale.
“I’m looking for work ethic,” Delaney-Smith said. “Day in and day out, regardless of whether the practice is great or not great, regardless of whether the win record is great or not great, I’m going to always work hard. My hope is that they work hard too.”
Rather than simply coaching from the sidelines, Delaney-Smith clearly practices what she preaches in striving for excellence.
“She will never be satisfied with as many wins as she has, and as many Ivy League titles,” said Allison Miller, Assistant Athletic Director of Communications. “She’s always learning as a coach, learning from other coaches, and learning from her team as well. Her competitive nature is just contagious within her team.”
Delaney-Smith doesn’t stop at cultivating this level of success on the court; it extends beyond, as her athletes develop in preparation for the life beyond college.
“The win mark is terrific, but she has a such a good reputation for fostering a good family environment around her team and seeing a lot of her players go on to successful careers outside of basketball,” said Director of Athletic Communications Timothy Williamson. “She’s a very driven person and she teaches a lot of the right lessons for teamwork and what you can accomplish when you really focus. She motivates her players through setting the right example, and that carries over to other things people do.”
Entering this weekend’s games in third place in the conference behind Penn and Princeton, Delaney-Smith acknowledged that the final Ivy standings are now out of the Crimson’s control. However, this coach doesn’t neglect the competition in the Ancient Eight, and recognizes her team’s accomplishments thus far.
“The Ivy League title is so hard to come by in the sport of basketball, so every year we are in the race for that title is extremely meaningful,” Delaney-Smith said. “If I can feel year in and year out that we’re in that race and we have an opportunity to win it, then I believe I’ve done my job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—With 2:34 left in a potentially title-deciding game and Yale cutting into its lead, Harvard turned to a familiar face to regain momentum.
After a series of crosscourt passes, junior wing Wesley Saunders sent a bullet to co-captain Laurent Rivard in the left corner. Rivard caught, shot, and extended his team’s advantage to double digits once more.
And with that bucket, the Harvard men’s basketball team marched into madness.
Two minutes later, it was official. The Crimson (25-4, 12-1 Ivy) had clinched its third straight berth in the NCAA Tournament with a 70-58 win over Yale (15-12, 9-4) on Friday night at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium. With the victory, Harvard also nabbed its third consecutive outright Ivy League title.
While the visiting squad was in control for a majority of the matchup, a late run from the Bulldogs necessitated the late game heroics from Rivard.
Following an up-and-under layup from Saunders, Eli sophomore forward Justin Sears forced the ball into the lane, drew contact, and sunk a baby jumper. With his and-one free throw, Sears cut Harvard’s advantage to 11, 57-46, and instigated Yale’s comeback attempt.
On the next possession, Sears grabbed a defensive board and pushed the ball up the court. The forward passed the rock off to a teammate, and got it back, slicing into the paint. Sears elevated, and slammed the ball home over Rivard, cutting his squad’s deficit to single digits for the first time since the opening half.
Yale began to pressure on defense as well, trapping Harvard in the backcourt in a 1-2-2 press.
However, with 3:28 to go, a Crimson dagger deflated Yale’s newfound energy.
Sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers brought the ball up the court, and sent the rock to senior forward Kyle Casey at the free-throw line. Casey looked around, and then returned the ball to Chambers, who was waiting with open hands at the top of the key. The point guard drilled the three, pushing Harvard’s lead to 11.
Sears responded with a pair of free throws, but it was too little too late as 68 seconds later, Rivard’s shot from deep all-but clinched the Crimson’s win, championship, and tournament bid.
“It’s obvious how thrilled and proud we are of that effort by our kids,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We prepared, we knew how challenging it would be going against [Yale] and especially here.… I think we’ve shown that we have been the best team in our league…. We are pleased for our program, thrilled for our school, and happy for our kids for a job well done.”
It took Harvard only one possession to gain control at the onset of the game.
After Yale corralled the opening tip, an errant pass from Bulldog sophomore Nick Victor led to a layup for junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi. On the team’s next possession, Chambers threaded a pass through two defenders to Casey, who slammed the ball home.
One missed Bulldog shot later, and Saunders was skipping through the lane, laying the rock into the hoop to give his team a 6-0 lead.
And so it continued.
Despite Sears scoring 28 of the Bulldogs’ 58 points, Yale found itself unable to stop either the Crimson’s penetration or its sharpshooting from deep, and Harvard’s first half run was capped off by consecutive three-pointers from co-captain Brandyn Curry.
Three players scored at least 14 points for the Crimson—with Chambers leading the pack at 17—while only Sears scored more than eight for Yale. The forward tallied 28 points and 13 rebounds, going 11-of-16 from the floor. It took over 10 minutes for a member of the Bulldogs not named Sears to put the ball in the hoop.
“[Sears is] as good as anyone in our conference,” Amaker said. “He’s an incredibly tough matchup for anyone and he has performed like that all season. We couldn’t stop him…. He’s one of the better big guys in the country that you could possibly have with his ability, athleticism, and skill level.”
“I’m not intelligent enough to give a good enough adjective [to describe Sears],” Yale coach James Jones added. “I am in awe of what he is able to do. I think [the rest of] our guys watch him too much because he is so dominant.”
Perhaps the most poignant moment of the night occurred with 46 seconds to go. As Chambers sunk two from the charity stripe, the Crimson fans in the rafters began their “I Believe” victory chant. The Bulldogs took the ball down the court, and dished it to junior guard Javier Duren, who laid the shot up. Amidst the cheers, Casey swatted the ball away from the hoop and across the floor, straight to Saunders.
Two Harvard possessions later, the team became the first in the country to nab an invitation to March Madness.
“You couldn’t ask for a much better [end to the season],” Curry said. “The last time we were [in this gym] playing for a championship we lost, and it means a lot to come back after everything and win in this place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—It was a Freaky Friday for Crimson goaltenders Steve Michalek and Raphael Girard.
On Jan. 11 at Madison Square Garden, junior Michalek had taken senior Girard’s spot in net after a goal from sophomore forward Cody Learned at 5:41 in the second period put Yale up three. On Friday night at Ingalls Rink, the two goaltenders skated a mile in the other’s moccasins as a breakaway strike from Learned at 5:44 in the middle frame put the Bulldogs up three and prompted Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 to swap in Girard for Michalek.
By the final horn, the story was the same for the Harvard and Yale men’s hockey teams. The defending national champions routed the Crimson, 4-0, in Game One of the teams’ first round ECAC Tournament series in New Haven.
“I give [the Bulldogs] credit, but I don’t think they had to be at their best, quite frankly,” Donato said. “We just made it too easy. The chances we gave them in a playoff scenario just can’t happen.”
In addition to Learned, the No. 16/15 Bulldogs (16-9-5, 10-8-4 ECAC) received goals from senior forward Jesse Root, senior defender Gus Young, and sophomore Carson Cooper to push the Crimson to the brink of elimination in the best-of-three series. Freshman Yale goaltender Alex Lyon recorded 24 saves for his second shutout in as many starts.
New injuries to freshman forward Luke Esposito and junior center Ryan McGregor forced the Crimson to enter the tournament shorthanded on offense. Donato started all eight of his healthy defensemen in order to fill out Harvard’s fourth line of forwards. On Saturday, the Crimson (10-16-4, 6-12-4) may have to confront more personnel issues after freshman Alex Kerfoot collapsed in pain near the Yale crease midway through the third period and left the game with an apparent upper body injury.
“We pretty much have everybody in that’s healthy, but it’s that time of year,” Donato said. “We could sit there and focus on the guys that aren’t in and aren’t healthy, but the reality is, that had nothing to do with the mistakes that we made."
The hosts used quick skating and crisp passing to capitalize on Harvard’s errors with the puck and take a two-goal lead into the first intermission.
Root struck first for Yale on a breakaway at 7:47 in the opening frame for his team-best 14th goal of the season. Junior defender Matt Killian forced a turnover in the Bulldog zone and forwarded the puck to senior left wing Kenny Agostino, who sprung Root with a one-touch pass at the Harvard blue line. Despite a hook from behind from Harvard senior defender Danny Fick, Root skated around Michalek for the score.
Fick’s hook put Yale on its second power play of the night and allowed the hosts to ride the wave of Root’s goal. As Fick left the box, a scramble developed in front of Michalek. Young stuffed the puck home on a wrap-around attempt to give the Bulldogs a two-goal lead at 9:56.
Early in the second period, Harvard established the Yale zone after a tripping minor to Agostino put the visitors on the man advantage, but the host’s special teams struck again. A clearing attempt from sophomore Yale defender Ryan Obuchowski skipped over the skate of freshman Harvard defender Victor Newell at the blue line and sent Learned off to the races for a coast-to-coast shorthanded goal.
“[The Bulldogs] are really good at capitalizing off our mistakes,” said freshman Harvard forward Sean Malone, who was named co-Ivy League Rookie of the Year alongside Lyon on Friday. “I think tomorrow we’re [going to] jump back here and look at some video and come out with a new game plan and try to beat them.”
Kerfoot went down at 11:42 in the third period and required the assistance of trainers and teammates to skate off the rink. Donato could not provide details on his condition following the game. Cooper tacked on Yale’s fourth of the game with less than four minutes left with a top-shelf wrister that beat Girard glove-side.
Harvard’s best chances to score came in the opening frame, but the Crimson struggled to find the shots to challenge Lyon. The freshman goaltender’s pads smothered an early breakaway opportunity from sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey. In the second period, the Bulldogs limited the Crimson to four shots. Harvard looked disjointed on the offensive side of the rink on a night in which the team occasionally had to skate four defenders at a time, but for Donato, the focus after the game was not on personnel but on execution.
“We need to execute a hell of a lot better,” Donato said. “I don’t think our game plan was to be in full control of the puck and then turn the puck over. Whether that’s strategic or just management of the puck, we know that we can play a lot better, and we’re going to need to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the clock wound down on Harvard’s (25-4, 12-1 Ivy) third consecutive Ivy League championship, punctuated by a 70-58 victory over Yale (15-12, 9-4), the difference between 2013 and 2014 was evident.
If the motto of last year’s team was ‘We have enough,’ the defining characteristic of the sequel was having an abundance of riches. After losing four starters and the sixth man from the 2011-2012 NCAA Tournament squad, last year’s team was driven by the efforts of improved underclassmen.
Then-freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, expected to play behind co-captain Brandyn Curry, was forced into a starting role, making All-Ivy first team along the way. Then-sophomores Wesley Saunders, Steve-Moundou-Missi, and Kenyatta Smith—the last an integral component of the bench unit a year before—became the heart of a defense that propelled Harvard into the NCAA Tournament’s round of 32.
The heart of the 2013 team returned to school, greeted by a waiting Curry and senior Kyle Casey. Top-100 recruit freshman Zena Edosomwan, fresh off an extra year at Northfield Mount Hermon, waited in the wings. Developing sophomores Evan Cummins and Agunwa Okoklie found their way into Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s rotation, giving Harvard a far different look than the year before.
“They won because they had depth and could afford injuries,” Yale coach James Jones said. “If Siyani is injured, you have Brandyn on the bench. How many guys have a first or second team All-Ivy guy on the bench? That’s the difference at Harvard.”
On Friday night, that depth was out on display. Curry had 14, including back-to-back threes at the end of the first half to ignite the team after a brief slump. Saunders had a well-rounded nine points, five rebounds, and four assists—amidst a wealth of weapons, the junior let the game come to him. Chambers had 17 points, playing both on (six assists) and off (two three-pointers) the ball in a free flowing offense.
To contain an imposing Bulldog front line of sophomore Justin Sears, junior Brandon Sherrod, and junior Matt Townsend, the Crimson took advantage of its significant frontcourt depth. Moundou-Missi had 16 points and six rebounds, taking turns fighting with Sears inside with Casey (five rebounds, three blocks).
“I have never been on a team with so many great defenders,” Curry said. “From Wes, who can guard a number of different positions to Siyani being so quick and pesky in passing lanes to Steve and Kyle down low … It’s been a lot of fun playing with these guys but that starts with defense.”
SEARING BLOWS
On a night where nothing fell for the Bulldogs, which shot 36 percent from the field and 0-for-14 from three, Sears was a lone bright spot. The Ivy League Player of the Year candidate had a monster double-double with 28 points and 13 rebounds. Sears went 11-of-16 from the field and 6-of-7 from the line.
The sophomore did it from beginning to end, scoring 11 of Yale’s first 17 points and then, late in the second half, 11 of 15 as the home team cut a 16-point Crimson lead down to nine. His tomahawk slam over co-captain Laurent Rivard brought the arena to its feet and brought back memories of Saunders’ Sportscenter Top-10-worthy destruction of Sherrod a year ago.
“He’s an incredibly tough matchup for anyone and he has performed like that all season,” Amaker said.
After a second, he phrased it more succinctly, “We couldn’t stop him.”
NOT-SO-CHARITABLE LINE
If stopping Sears was the one thing eluding the Crimson on the defensive end, the free throw line proved its only offensive foil. Harvard shot 57 percent from the field and had 13 assists on 25 field goals, sharing the ball well all night.
But when it got sent to the line, the hoop might as well have been the size of a chalice. Harvard missed 12 of its first 19 free throws and 18 of 32 overall. Saunders, Harvard’s leading scorer and its second-best free throw shooter, missed his first seven of the night en route to a 1-of-8 performance. In the first half alone, the Crimson was unable to convert the back end of three separate three-point plays.
“Our fool shooting was horrendous,” Amaker said. “I don’t know what to say but that’s not characteristic of this team.”
Harvard indeed had not shot so poorly at the line since its first matchup against Yale, when it made just 14 of 25 free throws in a 74-67 home loss. Saunders made just three of six free throws in that game, with seven different Harvard players missing at least one free throw.

The internet has been ablaze this week with news of the SAT undergoing some serious changes. The changes include cutting the penalty for incorrect guessing, eliminating esoteric vocabulary words (ha), and making the essay optional. Good start, College Board, but here are some suggestions to complete the overhaul.
 
1. No SAT 
The easiest improvement to the test would just be to eliminate it.The only people who think the SAT isn’t nonsense are people who scored a 1400+ or 2100+, and even they realize by the end of college (hell, by the end of freshman fall) that their high test scores don’t matter. Like, at all.
 
2. A “street-smarts” section
 
If they won’t eliminate the SAT, they should at least make it more applicable to students’ lives in the “real world.” Do students know how to perform an ocular patdown? Do students have a general idea of how to dress for an interview? These are important questions, folks. Life, death, and career opportunities are on the line.
 
3. Administer (mild?) electric shocks as the students work
 
Being able to work is being able to work under pressure.
 
4. Cultural references
 
This could include movies from the past few years, top-40 songs, Hollywood relationships, etc. Do colleges really want book-worms to make up the majority of their campus? (Answer: probably, but it would be hilarious to see some nerdy kid get back his 350 on Cultural Reasoning and have a breakdown.)
 
5. “Cheat temptations”
 
On, say, one out of every 100 examinations, put in a really official looking packet, sealed in plastic, labeled “SAT 2015 Answer Key - DO NOT open until all tests have been completed and handed in.” If the student opens the packet, it just says “ELIMINATION” in bold, blood-red letters. Better luck next time, you rascal.
 
The SAT, as it stands, is hardly a reflection of high school learning OR cultural/societal learning (alright, so maybe a bit of both). The College Board has made a solid start with all of this applicable vocabulary and whatnot, but let’s add a high-pressure environment and the necessity for random knowledge to the mix. Because high school students don’t stress enough about the college process, right?

It’s official: the College’s top administrator has started a book club.Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister probably made some bibliophiles’ dreams come true this week when he emailed undergraduates asking them to join him on Tuesday “for a little discussion and exploration” of a book he had previously recommended.“In my message just before the winter break, I recommended Elizabeth Gilbert's book ‘The Signature of All Things,’” Pfister wrote. “I also suggested we find a way to talk more about the book and have some fun with it. Now is the time.”But be warned: There is not unlimited space, Pfister wrote. Interested students must email his Harvard College dean account to claim what will surely be a coveted spot in the group.

Bobby Jindal, current governor of Louisiana, spoke about Barack Obama at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, slamming him for being “the most liberal and incompetent President” of his lifetime in response to his treatment of the current situation in Ukraine. No surprise there, as Jindal is a potential Republican candidate for the 2016 elections. But Jindal’s criticism went further than the typical shade both parties are guilty of throwing, and he proceeded to slam not only the POTUS but our very own Harvard Law School, too.“If I were him, I’d consider suing Harvard Law School to get his money back because I’m not sure what he learned in three years,” Jindal said. We feel like suing a law school is an endeavour doomed to fail anyway, and we’re also not entirely sure that Law School's purpose is to teach its students how to run a country. Clearly Obama missed a few too many sections in his “How to Handle One of the Most Convoluted International Relations Issues in Recent History While Appeasing Democrats, Republicans, and the Public, and Ensuring Global Security” class.And besides, can we then say that if we were him, we’d sue Brown for clearly teaching nothing about biology?

Prompt: Is it better to have a short and practical test, or a long, expensive, complicated one?
As a matriculated collegiate student, it’s easy to forget how laborious it was to take the SAT. However, I must adjure to forgotten memories of weekends spent with bombastic vocab words, and hours spent in session with Kaplan tutors and textbooks. Like Napoleon in the war of 1812, we can’t forget our previous battles, even if they ended in victory.
The old SAT was a cataclysmic test for many reasons—it hardly prepared the proletariat for college, required memorization of arcane knowledge, and the test experience itself was down right cloying. A prime example of this is Moses when he led the Buddha from the Garden of Eden. If Moses had prepared by fighting snakes, instead of studying poetry, then maybe the Buddha would have emerged without such a large belly.
Thankfully, the College Board has decided to circumvent the old derogatory SAT, and appropriate a new one starting in the spring of 2016. Less emphasis will be placed on diabolical language, there won’t be any required essay, and the reading and writing sections will be combined for a grand total of only 1600 points instead of 2400. This reminds me of a personal experience last April at my cousin’s 8th birthday party. We were all trying to divide up the cake into 24 even slices, when I realized, it would be so much easier if we only split it into 16!
In conclusion, the College Board organization has made the SAT evaluation much easier for the future Harvard College class of 2021. Their results will more efficiently reflect their future collegiate performance, and they will theoretically spend less resources on test prep. However, let this not be a crutch for the younger posterity. As Florence Nightingale once said, “I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse.”

For those who were too busy studying for their midterms, it was recently revealed that Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and sixteenth wealthiest person in the world (moving up from last year’s 580th), will speak at Harvard’s 363rd Commencement ceremony on May 29. Hey Mikey, since we know you read Flyby, here are some tips to help you with your speech.1) Don’t try to confiscate anyone’s beverage Everyone knows you have a thing against big soft drinks. On that sweltering May day, just let people chug down lukewarm Diet Cokes as they sit wondering why tuition doesn’t cover an air-conditioned ceremony.2) No frisking anyoneIt’s a known fact that you are a big proponent of Stop and Frisk. Do not try to enforce it in Cambridge. Graduation is one of the most important events in a person’s life and no one wants it ruined by being frisked while getting their diploma. Also, no one wants to be frisked in public at all.3) Don’t try speaking in a different languageEven though Harvard is a college of great diversity and is appreciative of other cultures, take this advice and stick to speaking English. Don’t make commencement more awkward then it has to be.4) Stick to your allotted timeYou’re used to extending your term-limits, but please don’t go over your time limit. Short and sweet (just like 17 oz of Coke!) is best. Especially since humanities concentrators need to use all the time they can get in order to find a job.
 If you keep these tips in mind, hopefully you won’t offend too many people, but not boring the audience to tears is another issue even we can’t help you with.
