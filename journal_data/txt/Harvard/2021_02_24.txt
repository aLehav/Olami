After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Joe Biden cited Harvard as a reason not to forgive more than $10,000 of student debt. In a Feb. 16 CNN town hall, the President expressed his opposition to several Democrats’ push for up to $50,000 worth of debt relief, arguing that he would not “forgive the debt, the billions of dollars of debt, for people who have gone to Harvard and Yale and Penn.”
We find the President’s shoutout a bit misguided. According to the U.S. Department of Education’s college scorecards, only three percent of undergraduates at Harvard receive federal loans. Better yet, according to high education expert Mark Kantrowitz, only 0.3 percent of federal student borrowers attended Ivy League colleges. It’s not our student debt — but we still want Biden to forgive it.
To be clear, Biden must prioritize forgiving student debt, and should not feel beholden to his self-imposed $10,000 limit. He should not use the Ivy League and its handful of debt-accruing graduates as an excuse to water down his policies.
As we have previously opined, student loan forgiveness offers the rare opportunity to level the socioeconomic playing field, providing social mobility to those saddled with debt for no other reason than that their parents — like the average American citizen — could not afford tens of thousands of dollars in out of pocket expenses. There is also a non-negligible racial justice component to the proposed executive action: Black students are significantly more likely to rely on student loans than their white counterparts, and hence stand to gain more from broad federal relief. Further, focusing on dissecting those deemed worthy of loan forgiveness from the “undeserving” with a fine-tooth comb is frustratingly unproductive at a time when American students and graduates are suffocating under the weight of $1.7 trillion worth of debt.
We often see the Ivy League used as a political tool, usually in incorrect or misleading ways, to rally against progressive policies. Biden’s embrace of this trend is deeply disappointing. After all, he stuffed his Cabinet posts with affiliates of our institution.
Still, the truth is that America’s education gap cannot be eradicated solely by implementing student debt relief. In fact, forgiving student debt is hardly a panacea to the inequities in higher education, and might distract from a deeper, tougher question: What creates this massive debt in the first place?
The answer is simple: College tuition is stupidly expensive and rising too fast. No policy approach that fails to reckon with this basic fact will prove sufficiently transformative in the long run. That doesn’t mean student debt forgiveness isn’t worthwhile — public policy can prove incredibly life-changing to specific individuals while leaving the broader system intact — but rather, that it simply isn’t enough.
As Biden pointed out — while nodding to his alma mater, the University of Delaware, with his blue and yellow tie — the public-private university divide complicates the discussion of college tuition in the U.S. Forgiving student debt regardless of where that student attended ignores this divide, and we do not see this as an issue. Crippling student debt is crippling student debt, and the bills need to be paid regardless of how many tax dollars your university received. Out-of-state tuition at the University of Michigan is more expensive than tuition at Harvard. In many cases, stressing the divide is a moot point. Moving forward, however, both sides of the public-private binary must make themselves affordable. The federal and state governments need to step in to make public colleges and universities accessible without loans, and private schools must reduce tuition and bolster financial aid.
The Biden administration ought to agree to a generous student loan forgiveness program beyond any arbitrary boundaries. But even that won’t be enough. Simply allowing debt relief is treating the symptoms of a broken education system while ignoring their roots; it does not cure the disease, even if it temporarily limits its impact. The accumulating debt for students in higher education will continue to infect scholars in this country, unless the Biden administration recognizes that even the broadest loan forgiveness program is a short-term solution for a long-standing problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Plastic has made its way from the top of Mount Everest to the depths of the Mariana Trench. It is frozen in Arctic ice and coursing through our own bodies. Plastic is churned out at a rapid pace that has surpassed most other man-made materials. Half of all the plastic that humans produce becomes trash in less than a year, and it takes more than 400 years to degrade. At Harvard, the lifespan of much of our plastic is particularly short: the time it takes you to eat lunch.
After Harvard transformed normal operations to re-open safely amid the pandemic, many students returned to an unrecognizable campus. Once the hub of many students’ social lives, dining halls were reconfigured to prevent Covid-19 transmission from indoor dining. Students now receive their meals in plastic containers, which they carry in plastic or paper bags to their rooms. There, they eat with plastic cutlery and drink out of plastic water bottles. They microwave their food in plastic containers, whose “microwave safe” labels do not guarantee that they’re free of risk to human health. Then, the dumpsters fill up. Harvard is leaving students with no choice but to accumulate intolerable and unnecessary amounts of garbage. But if we recycle, it’s all good, right?
Well, no. Often, recycling confuses or frustrates. Perhaps worse is when it satisfies. Even when we carefully rinse, sort, and separate, we’re only washing our hands of our mess. It doesn’t disappear.
This is not a comment on Harvard University Dining Services’ service or quality, which has been stellar in difficult circumstances. This is about Harvard reneging on its commitment to sustainability.
Coronavirus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, not from surface contact. So, with proper cleaning, reusable containers and bags are safe. For plastic cutlery or plastic water bottles, there is no Covid-related justification — only a predilection to take the easy, wasteful route.
It should come as no surprise that the plastic industry is cheering on and encouraging our collective backsliding toward single-use dominion.
Plastic manufacturers want you to think that recycling is the solution to the pollution they generate so that consumers internalize the blame for the debris that is accumulating in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch or washing up on remote island beaches. But very little of the plastic we toss in the blue bin actually gets recycled; in fact, less than 10 percent does. So, nearly all of the plastic produced piles up in landfills or drifts elsewhere in nature.
But the plastics crisis isn’t just harming the planet — it is also a human rights problem. The United States incinerates more plastic than it recycles. And disturbingly, nearly 80 percent of waste incinerators in the U.S. are in low-income communities and/or communities of color, exposing residents to carcinogens and toxic gas that plastic combustion creates.
The United States also exports its plastic pollution, offloading our waste onto countries less equipped to handle it.
Since China stopped receiving American plastic waste in 2018, the United States is increasingly turning to the Global South as a dumping ground. Because plastic is so difficult to recycle, and because we chuck such massive quantities, even countries that banned certain single-use plastics internally are now overwhelmed by our garbage. As a result, our excess is destined to clog poorer nations’ soil, air, and water for centuries.
But while plastic manufacturers initiated this catastrophe, we consumers perpetuate it. We have an obligation to change our behavior and lead by example. Harvard can and should responsibly provide meals without excessive waste.
First, plastic bottles can be easily eliminated. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection maintains that tap water in Cambridge is carefully tested and safe to drink. But many students prefer extra-filtered water, particularly if they come from places with unsafe tap water. Therefore, Harvard should launch a water safety education campaign and provide reusable bottles and water dispensers in hallways.
Second, though paper can be more easily composted or recycled than plastic, paper bags require a lot of energy and resources to create. There are trade-offs with every type of bag, but one thing is certain: Reusing is what makes the difference. Three bags per student per day is excessive. Harvard should require students to bring their own bags, as well as arrange dining halls so that students can collect their meals without passing their bags to HUDS staff.
Third, Harvard should do away with plastic cutlery, which is not recyclable. Harvard should provide students with stainless steel forks, knives, and spoons, as well as dish soap and cleaning supplies. Harvard may be concerned that students would not properly clean reusable cutlery. If that is a concern, shouldn’t Harvard also be concerned about students leaving food to rot in their rooms? Or whether Harvard students are properly brushing their teeth?
Harvard’s overreliance on disposables is not necessitated by public health measures, but rather is a symptom of widespread and destructive carelessness. You may doubt that any of these changes would make a dent in a problem of such massive proportions. It is easy to think individual consumption changes are futile when the impacts are hidden from your sight. However, to dig our heels into our outsized footprints is to further the idea that Harvard students are somehow entitled to undue convenience and wastefulness at the expense of others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, Leon D. Black seems like the ideal university donor, a poster boy for billionaire philanthropy. In 1990, he co-founded Apollo Global Management, a now colossal private equity firm. Black’s subsequent fortune allowed him to become a productive, charitable member of elite society, a patron of the arts both as Museum of Modern Art chairman and as a private collector best known for purchasing one of the four original versions of “The Scream” for just under $120 million at a Sotheby’s auction.
A successful alumnus of the Harvard Business School, Black has also become a prominent supporter of our university and its intellectual mission. He and his family foundation have pledged almost $20 million to Harvard and its various schools, including a $7.5 million contribution to create student fellowships for U.S. military members at the Kennedy School of Government where he (coincidentally enough) also serves as a member of the Leadership Council.
Yet his Munch-buying luck has been down as of late. In October, a New York Times exposé revealed extensive ties between Black and another New York financier: convicted sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein. Back in 2019, Black had dismissed the allegations of criminal Epstein connections and the “tsunami” of coverage as “the gift that never stops giving … it’s salacious, it involves elements of politics, of me-too, of rich and powerful people.”
But the tsunami led to reckoning, as they usually do. An internal review commissioned by Apollo emphasized that there was no evidence that Black had been involved in any criminal activity, but revealed that he had paid Epstein almost $160 million over five years for advice on a variety of tax and philanthropy issues. It was damning enough to cost Black his job as Chief Executive Officer of his own firm.
Now the contents and character of the review, conducted by Wall Street law firm Dechert LLP, could fill up an entire column, if not a series. There’s, for example, the fact that the chairman of the supposedly independent committee overseeing the probe had eyebrow-raising ties to Apollo itself only five years ago; the skepticism of several industry insiders about the veracity of the report; or even Dechert’s own admission that it was aided in its probe by a former Apollo outside legal counselor, Paul Weiss, who had helped vet Epstein’s advice to Black in the past (whatever happened to conflicts of interest?). Black’s connections to Epstein, particularly as they relate to our university — where several professors enjoyed an unexpected windfall as a result of an Epstein-mediated introduction with Black — are hardly a settled matter.
But let’s, for a change, assume the best — we know at this point that that’s how our own institution is dealing with such allegations. Assume that Black really had no unseemly ties to Epstein, that their relationship was based entirely on professional convenience and financial advantage. Let’s look beyond the ties themselves and zero into their presumed origin — we might find a less salacious but more meaningful tale, a story of wealthy philanthropists and the broken tax code that makes them.
According to the Dechert report, Epstein offered his “most valuable piece of work” to Black in 2012, paving the way for the sex offender to gain substantial monetary and personal access to one of New York finance's most powerful people. The “work” itself was some financial advice related to how to best manage Black’s Grantor Retained Annuity Trust — or GRAT for short. Epstein’s advice reportedly saved Black "as much as $1 billion or more” in tax liabilities.
Black's astronomical saving — almost enough to, for example, quadruple federal funding for Historically Black colleges and universities — would account for roughly one-eighth of Black's current estimated net worth. It embodies the kind of perfectly legal, deeply impactful tax avoidance that's popular among the ultra-wealthy, including a certain former President, and that deepens economic inequality and mistrust in the fairness of our institutions.
So what are GRATs, anyway? I exchanged emails with Harvard Law Professor Robert H. Sitkoff to get a better understanding of how the technique, popularized by Harvard graduate Richard Covey ’50, actually works. Sitkoff described GRATs as "a normal and customary estate planning tool to minimize transfer taxes," and agreed that minimizing tax liabilities (namely transfer taxation) was their primary purpose.
"A GRAT is an irrevocable trust to which the donor conveys property and that provides for a term of annuity payments from the trust to the donor," Sitkoff explained.
To oversimplify a complex evasion mechanism from which few readers are likely to benefit, an individual can create a trust and receive payments from it for a given amount of time, after which the remaining contents of the trust go to the assigned beneficiary. Such gifts would usually be taxed under the aptly named gift tax, but under a GRAT the fiscal liability becomes more complicated. The gift tax is applied upon the creation of the GRAT, but is calculated under the erroneous assumption that the property within it will increase in value at the (now historically low) federally established rate — even if it turns out to do so at a substantially higher pace — and is not applied to the sum of annuity payments taken out of the trust. Combine that underestimated future value with exempt annuity payments, and you have what on paper seems like a small or inexistent gift, liable to little taxation, even as you transfer substantial wealth to a second party.
So, back to Black: A Harvard graduate pioneers a complex system to avoid millions in taxation. A New York billionaire uses that same technique on advice from Epstein, and invests a fraction of his newly engorged wealth donating to Epstein-linked professors and setting up a fellowship program named after himself. Society is cheated out of hundreds of millions in revenue — the kind of funds that could go a very long way towards setting up universal pre-school federally — and Harvard gets a permanent tie to a now-tainted mogul.
Harvard’s desire for donations is more than understandable. It is the base of our exceptional financial aid program, arguably one of the reasons why Harvard, unlike other schools, can offer need-blind admissions even to international applicants. We all love the generous fellowships and excellent infrastructure that tax-avoiding pseudo-philanthropists have provided us.
But our institution and its counterparts are trapped in a gold-plated version of the prisoner’s dilemma. Harvard — along with the MoMA and other Black-financed enterprises — could benefit from the increased levels of federal funding afforded by equitable, grift-free taxation. More crucially, they have, or perhaps should have, a duty as society-minded institutions to protect the public’s well-being against the excesses of exorbitant inequality.
Because we are all competing for the very same handful of billionaire donors, we also have an incentive to simply follow the money. To create pretentiously named “Leadership Councils” that reward financial support, and offer donation options that emphasize tax breaks and financial rewards. This twisted game theory dilemma might explain why our university’s split with Epstein was half-hearted at best, and why it doesn’t seem to be seriously re-examining its ties to Black amidst broad backlash, even after he subverted the spirit of our gift policy by facilitating funds to Epstein proteges after his conviction. A spokesperson for the Kennedy School of Government didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment for this article.
But as in the prisoner’s dilemma, the incentive to reject donations on the grounds of unmet tax responsibilities is low. If Black doesn’t donate to our school he can simply take his money elsewhere — there isn't exactly a shortage of institutions eager to accept seven-figure contributions. So we find ourselves in an ethically gray no man’s land, unable or unwilling to forcefully oppose the undermining of the social goals that we value, perpetually pursuing the ultrawealthy so they can redirect their fortune to our own community. We become the silent beneficiaries of an unfair elite before we have even groomed its next generation, and Harvard remains intimately intertwined with GRATs, grifts, and Leon Black.

In the spring of 1986, U.S. Rep. Jamin Ben “Jamie” Raskin ’83 (D-Md.) took a constitutional law class taught by Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, where Raskin met his future wife and decided to dedicate his life to constitutional law.
More than two decades later, Tribe also taught Joshua A. Matz, whom he recruited as a head teaching fellow and with whom he later co-authored two books.
At the beginning of 2021, the three Law School alums reconvened to take part in a defining moment in the history of the United States: Raskin as lead House impeachment manager; Matz as impeachment counsel and “the backbone of the legal efforts behind both impeachments,” per Tribe; and Tribe as their consultant and one of the foremost minds in the United States on constitutional law.
Together, they helped craft the House’s legal strategy for the second impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump on the charge of inciting an insurrection, following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol that left five dead.
In interviews with The Crimson, Raskin, Matz, and Tribe reflected on their experiences coming together for the historic trial and on its legacy in an increasingly polarized country.
Matz said the House’s legal team benefited from Tribe’s constitutional expertise, particularly relating to claims of jurisdiction, the First Amendment, and due process, which the opposition frequently brought up.
“Larry is the kind of thinker who can cut through 30 complicated issues simultaneously without breaking a sweat,” Matz said. “Larry was extraordinarily helpful in advising the House managers and their staff as we formulated a strategy that would keep the President’s conduct front and center, and that would knock away the entirely meritless legal excuses that he tried to put forward in an effort to escape accountability.”
While Tribe said his contributions to Trump’s first impeachment trial — on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in early 2020 — mainly consisted of simplifying “intricate and complicated” legal issues, he said there were “no such problems” during the second trial.
“Anybody with half a brain could realize that what we had was a president who refused to leave office and would do anything he could — legal or illegal — to pressure people into creating the false impression that he had somehow won,” Tribe said.
Tribe said Trump’s actions at the center of the second impeachment trial were more clear-cut than those in the first impeachment.
“Everyone in the country was a witness. The attempt to steal the election and become a tyrant was played out in real time in front of the entire world,” he said. “I honestly think I didn’t make that much of a difference, because the President did it all himself.”
Ultimately, the Senate voted 57 to 43 to convict Trump, failing to reach the supermajority required. Still, Tribe pointed to the fact that the House impeachment managers convinced seven Republicans to vote to convict the former president — the most bipartisan vote in the history of American impeachment trials.
“It’s not chopped liver,” Tribe said. “That’s a pretty serious, lopsided conviction.”
Though the Senate voted to acquit Trump, Raskin said he believes Democrats successfully convinced the American people that Trump violated his oath of office by inciting an insurrection.
“That was a bipartisan vote of unprecedented magnitude in our history. More importantly, we feel like he was convicted in the court of public opinion, in the court of history,” Raskin said of Trump.
Tribe said extreme partisanship in the U.S. government has severely limited the power of impeachment — a topic he explores in his 2018 book with Matz, “To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.”
“If you have a Senate which is so tethered to the President’s political cult that is unwilling to perform its oath of impartially judging whether the President is guilty or not, the impeachment power doesn’t perform the way the framers intended it to perform,” Tribe said.
Tribe said working with his students on the impeachment trial exemplified the “great privilege of teaching.”
“Teaching, and then learning from, and getting to know these amazing people has been the most satisfying thing in my life next to my personal relationships with my children and grandchildren, my partner Elizabeth, and my ex-wife,” Tribe said.
Tribe described Raskin as a “a profile in courage” for helming the impeachment effort immediately following the death of his son, Thomas B. “Tommy” Raskin, on Dec. 31 — a mere six days before Raskin and his family took cover from the mob storming the House chamber.
After Raskin solicited Tribe’s advice, Tribe said he recommended Raskin take on the task of impeachment. Tribe said he experienced a similar dilemma when his own father died unexpectedly 10 days before his first Supreme Court argument, Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia.
“In hindsight, I thought it was the best thing that could have happened to me, that I had something that I thought was important and of great value to the fundamentals of democracy to pour myself into rather than focusing entirely on my grief,” Tribe said. “And I sort of felt it might help Jamie in that way to have something as challenging and important as this, because he had committed his life to constitutional values.”
Shortly before the onset of the impeachment trial, Raskin expressed gratitude for his support, according to Tribe.
“He told me he felt that Tommy was in his heart with him as he proceeded,” Tribe said. “The sweetest and most mind-blowing thing he said to me was, ‘Tommy is in my heart tomorrow, and you will be too.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coronavirus pandemic has brought a plethora of new measures to Harvard’s campus, including social distancing, mask wearing, and avoiding in-person gatherings. Among the most disruptive is leaving campus for isolation housing upon testing positive for the coronavirus.
Consistent with the fall semester, students living on campus self-administer three polymerase chain reaction tests — known as PCR tests — per week using kits designed by Color Genomics, a health and technology company. Students then drop off their tests in designated gray bins around campus. The Broad Institute processes their test kits, and Color Genomics notifies students of their test results on the company’s online portal, often within a day.
Results are listed as negative, positive, unsatisfactory, or inconclusive. When results come back as negative, students are free to continue with their usual activities. When results come back as inconclusive or unsatisfactory, students are asked to submit a replacement test as quickly as possible to be reprocessed.
Of the 85,501 Covid-19 tests conducted on undergraduates since June 1 of last summer, 54 undergraduate students have tested positive for Covid-19 as of Feb. 23. Here’s what happens after a student receives a positive test result.
Students will receive a phone call from Harvard University Health Services notifying them of their positive result, as well as an email from Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Mike Burke that explains how they should proceed.
The email instructs students to temporarily isolate in their bedroom until they check into isolation housing. Students are asked only to leave to use the bathroom. Students should register for meal deliveries from Harvard University Dining Services over text, inform their families that they have tested positive for Covid-19, and pack for isolation, per the email.
Students are also sent a room number, check-in time, and directions to their room at the Harvard Square Hotel, where College students isolate.
If students are unable to move to isolation housing by themselves, they can contact HUHS, which will help transport the student to isolation housing safely, HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry wrote in an email.
Burke's email acknowledges that many individuals who test positive for Covid-19 only exhibit mild symptoms, but asks students to contact HUHS immediately if they experience severe symptoms including trouble breathing or persistent chest pain.
Burke’s email also asks students to take care of their mental health. The email, which notes “it can be stressful and lonely to be separated from others," provides contact information for Counseling and Mental Health Services.
Shortly after a student tests positive, an HUHS contact tracer will call the student to help them identify their close contacts.
HUHS will then reach out separately to those named contacts to notify them they may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Close contacts are defined as individuals who have been within six feet for at least 15 minutes within the two days prior to the positive test or before symptoms arose, per Perry.
Generally, contacts are instructed to self-quarantine in their dorm rooms and are given specific instructions on those guidelines during the call. Students may be eligible for early release if they exhibit no symptoms for 10 days and receive a negative test result on the eighth day or later, Perry added.
If contacts do not have their own room and bathroom, HUHS recommends they remain in their bedroom except to use the bathroom or take a coronavirus test. If they share a bathroom, HUHS advises another person not use it for at least 15 minutes, Perry wrote.
In certain circumstances, based on exposure to someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, HUHS may decide to move contacts into isolation housing at the Harvard Square Hotel. HUHS has done so fewer than five times since it started contact tracing, according to Perry.
Contacts have a modified testing schedule to limit time spent outside of their rooms. HUHS recommends testing at least once during the quarantine period.
Perry wrote that all conversations students have with contact tracers are confidential, and contact tracers do not share information with the Community Council or Ad Board. The identity of the positive case also remains confidential during the contact tracing process. All contacts are notified that they have been exposed to someone who tested positive for Covid-19 and the date on which they were exposed. HUHS contact tracers will not confirm a name if asked.
Consistent with guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, students are expected to stay in their Harvard Square Hotel room for the entirety of the isolation period, which usually lasts 10 days.
A HUHS staff member will call the student every day to conduct wellness checks, ask if the student is experiencing any symptoms or needs any supplies, and inform the student when they plan to pay an in-person visit to the student later that day. The staff member will then visit the student in person to take their temperature and check their oxygen levels, per the registrar's email.
Within these daily check-ins, if significant mental health concerns arise, students are referred to CAMHS for further support, Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis wrote in an emailed statement.
Whether students are in isolation or quarantine, Lewis wrote that CAMHS offers services remotely over the phone or Zoom.
“The CAMHS team understands and empathizes with our students who are experiencing the stress of navigating through a pandemic and the loneliness that you may be feeling, especially for those who are in isolation and quarantine,” she wrote.
Resident Deans will also reach out to students in isolation to help them obtain any academic accommodations they may need.
After leaving isolation, students return to their dorms and do not submit Covid-19 tests for 90 days — roughly the time it takes the body to completely shed the virus, according to Perry.
The 90-day testing exemption does not apply to contacts, only individuals who have tested positive.

Setti D. Warren, currently executive director of the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, will serve as executive director of the Institute of Politics effective March 15, IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote in a letter to affiliates Tuesday.
Warren served as mayor of Newton, Mass. from 2010 to 2018, making him the first popularly elected African American mayor in the Commonwealth, Gearan wrote in his announcement. Warren also served as special assistant in the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs for then-President Bill Clinton.
Gearan wrote he feels confident in Warren’s ability to execute his new responsibilities.
“Setti brings a combination [of] experiences in public service, a deep commitment to students and demonstrated management skills that will serve the IOP at this important time in our civic life” Gearan wrote.
Warren will succeed Amy Howell, who ascended the Institute's ranks to become its executive director in April 2017. Howell previously served as the Director of the Institute’s Internships and Career Services Office, where she launched the IOP's Directors Internship Program that helps Harvard students land summer internships in politics, government, and public service that are fully-funded by Harvard, according to an IOP website.
Warren said in an interview he is “thrilled” to take on his new leadership role at the Institute.
“Coming from the world of politics and public service, the opportunity to work directly with students to help shape and advise and give the next generation of public servants and young people in politics is a very, very exciting opportunity for me,” Warren said.
“We live in such a fast-moving, ever-changing, evolving nation and world, and I’m looking forward to working with the students and the IOP team to ensure we continue to meet the moment,” Warren added.
Warren also reflected on his time at the Shorenstein Center, which he will leave next month.
“I was really excited to be a part of promoting the work, growing the work at the Shorenstein Center around the technology and social change projects,” he said. “Just a few of the projects that I think have made real impact in the world of public policy and media.”
Shorenstein Center Director Nancy R. Gibbs called Warren's appointment to the IOP “bittersweet” in a letter to Shorenstein affiliates.
“As Executive Director, Setti has tended carefully to the wellbeing of all of our staff and endeavors,” Gibbs wrote. “At such a critical time, given the challenges to our information ecosystem, I’ve been grateful every day for his advice, experience and political acumen. I know the IOP community will thrive with him as part of its leadership.”

University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay explained Ivy League decisions regarding athletics competition amid the coronavirus pandemic to Harvard student athletes in a webinar Tuesday.
The event, moderated by Director of Harvard Athletic Director Erin McDermott, allowed student athletes to communicate directly with administrators about the Ivy League's decision to cancel athletics competition for the entire academic year as well as Harvard's planning for athletics during the fall semester. In advance of the event, student athletes submitted questions for the administrators.
Some students raised questions about the Ivy League’s recent decision to extend a temporary waiver permitting seniors to compete for their current insitutions next year provided they are enrolled in a graduate program. The decision, made during a global health crisis that has led to the year-long cancellation of Ivy League sports, marked a departure from longstanding League policies barring graduate students from competition.
Bacow said he and his colleagues mulled over the decision for some time before determining which accommodations to grant to senior student athletes. He acknowledged that the decision “wasn’t perfect,” citing concerns that the League granted the waiver without sufficient advance before graduate program application deadlines.
“I think to go back and ask graduate programs to reopen their admissions is a bridge too far, because it does sort of become the tail wagging the dog,” Bacow said.
Bacow said he and the other Ivy League presidents ultimately decided against extending the temporary waiver to any other class of student athletes to avoid normalizing the practice.
“The concern there was, if we did that, it would extend a very long tail,” Bacow said. “We worried that if we did that, then it would be institutionalized in a lot of people’s minds, and we didn’t want to go there.”
Also during the webinar, Gay said life on Harvard's campus next fall will be contingent on the state of the public health crisis and corresponding health guidelines put in place by government officials.
“There’s a lot here that is out of our control, and it’s not just that because we can’t necessarily control the course of the virus and the pandemic, but we also are bound by guidelines imposed by the federal, state and local authorities,” she said.
Though Gay said she remains “optimistic” about the fall semester, she added that she and her colleagues are “preparing for the worst.”
“We plan to push the envelope to the extent possible while still being responsible, but we also know that we’ve got to be realistic,” Gay said. “This is a pandemic that over the last 13 months has constantly surprised us, has made us pivot more than once.”
Some student athletes who attended the webinar said they appreciated the opportunity to have an open line of communication between them and administrators.
Student Athlete Advisory Committee Co-President and Harvard baseball player Matthew R. Thomas ’21 said he was “grateful” to hear more about the rationale behind athletic planning.
“I was grateful that he took the time to explain the rationale behind it,” Thomas said of Bacow. “I hope this establishes a precedent for more open communication going forward because I think it’s good for athletes to hear from people who are making decisions that determine their future and their roles.”
Though Thomas said it was “disappointing” to learn last week that the League canceled the spring athletics season, he said the prospect of athletics operating in the fall is “encouraging.”
“One thing that was encouraging to hear was Dean Gay say that they hope to be as close to normal as possible by fall, which is nice to hear there is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
Harvard track and field athlete Kyle A. Englander ’23 said he feels conflicted about how the University has treated student athletes relative to the rest of the student body.
“I picked up one quote that President Bacow said where he said, ‘The North Star is treating athletes like every other student,’ which, in some respects, I can understand,” Englander said. “But also, I do think that a one-size-fits-all approach to every type of student maybe isn’t the smartest approach, and maybe one that I don’t agree with.”
Bacow concluded the panel by recognizing student athletes' resiliance in the face of adversity brought on by the pandemic.
“We are being tested, all of us now, in ways we have never been tested before,” Bacow said. “People are going to be writing about this experience for generations.”
“You guys are going to be talking to your grandchildren about this,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School students, some of the only Harvard affiliates who experienced in-person classes last fall, praised the hybrid classroom model that the school debuted in the fall and continued this spring.
Spring semester courses at the Business School take place either fully remotely or in hybrid classrooms, in which rotating groups of 25 students attend in-person classes that are also available on Zoom, allowing remote students to participate as well.
In a Feb. 16 Covid-19 update to HBS affiliates, Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi and Business School Dean Srikant M. Datar wrote that 115 class sessions were held in a hybrid classroom in the previous week.
David Chataway, a second-year Master of Business Administration student, wrote in an email that he has “really appreciated” the hybrid model, calling remote instruction “fantastic.”
“The combination of lectures and exercises remotely and safely in person taught important communication skills for conducting business over both mediums,” Chataway wrote.
Second-year MBA student Olubukunola “Bukie” Adebo said she intentionally sought out hybrid courses for the “classroom experience” that includes “energy and movement.”
When in person for these hybrid classes, Adebo said, the course “basically operates like normal class” — students still raise their hands and engage with peers and professors — aside from the fact that they don masks and are seated far apart from each other.
“Even when I’m not in the classroom for the hybrid classes, just the fact that the professor’s standing in a room and writing on a board and moving around in the space, that even makes the class better,” Adebo said.
Adebo also commended the Business School for the improvements it has made to remote learning since first transitioning online nearly a year ago. Calling the initial virtual classes in spring 2020 “atrocious,” Adebo said it was very difficult to stay engaged.
In the fall and this spring, however, Adebo said she saw “a huge difference” in the quality of instruction.
“A lot of professors found out what really works for them — they realized they needed to be drawing on an iPad, or standing in front of a board, or whatever they needed to do to feel a little bit more natural,” she said. “Most professors have figured that out, and they’re more comfortable navigating the Zoom environment.”
Still, Adebo said the school could further improve the remote experience if professors were more “sensitive” and afforded more “flexibility.”
“People taking classes from home means that people are dealing with home stuff — you have partners who have kids, you have weird stuff going on in your apartment, and just being a little bit more understanding about that,” she said.
Business School spokesperson Mark Cautela wrote in an email that transitioning to virtual classes last spring was “a new experience” that the school has since worked to refine.
“The unexpected pivot to virtual teaching in Spring 2020 utilized only the zoom platform—an approach that was largely unfamiliar to everyone,” he wrote. “Even with intensive efforts to ensure training and the appropriate technology set-ups, it was a new experience trying to replicate the dynamic interaction of a typical class session.”
Cautela added that HBS has integrated “extensive feedback” from faculty since then in order to create new instructional models that will “continue to evolve and likely will be needed in the future, too.”
Farah H. Azmi, a second-year MBA student who has chosen to take all of her courses virtually this academic year, said the remote experience has made her spring semester thus far “bittersweet.”
Because second-year HBS students choose electives rather than attending a set of required courses with the same cohort of peers, as first-year students do, Azmi said remote learning has left her feeling isolated.
“This semester and the fall semester — when I was doing classes via Zoom — it was weird because I didn’t know any of these faces, I didn’t recognize any of their voices,” she said. “It’s just a much different atmosphere. Whenever you’re just surrounded, you’re introduced to people in a different way.”
Second-year MBA student Burjis N. Godrej said remote instruction has had its benefits, too. One of those benefits is Zoom’s breakout rooms, which Godrej said are beneficial for meeting new classmates.
“In a regular classroom, you could only talk to the people who are next to you, but in a breakout room, you’re randomly matched with people in the classroom, so you get to meet many more people and discuss these topics with them,” Godrej said.
Azmi added she has found that online classes also grant more “flexibility,” allowing her to fit more activities into a day.
“If you think about Zoom classes, you’re able to work on something else up until the last second,” she said. “I can squeeze in a workout, I can squeeze in a couple more emails, versus whenever you’re in class in person, it’s hard to do all those extra things.”

If you’re an out-of-state student, starting your new Harvard life is exciting for a lot of reasons. New friends, new experiences, new traditions…and of course: new weather. If you’re like me and you hail from a place that hasn’t seen snow since the last Ice Age, fear not, for my brief time on campus before Covid-19 has taught me a bit about what it means to live in a city where the weather literally wants to kill you.
Your High-Top Converse are NOT Snowshoes
You know those go-to sneakers you count on for most occasions? The scuffed-up Converse, the crusty AF1s, or the Vans with the huge hole in the toe area...you know the ones. Yeah, those won’t work. If you hate wet socks as much as I do, you’ll invest in a solid pair of boots that’ll get you through anything, from a foot-deep puddle to a romp in the snow with your roomies.
Your Current Jacket is Inadequate
Back home, I had one trusty jacket that would get me through the coldest days of Los Angeles winters (mid 50s Fahrenheit). When I got to Cambridge, I thought, “This jacket will be fine, right?” It was not fine. My trusty jacket could barely get me through a day in autumn. And rain? Forget about it. Bottom line: Invest in a weatherproof coat. They’re more expensive than your average outerwear, but you’ll only need one – plus, it’ll last your entire college career.
What is Canada Goose?
If you’re on campus already, you might have noticed that some students carry themselves through the cold with a certain confidence. Maybe you noticed their trendy parkas: the ones with the red, blue, and white circular logo. This is the mark of Canada Goose, the stylishly expensive outerwear brand that you’ll see many students sporting during your time at Harvard. Don’t feel bad if you don’t have one. The geese thank you for it.
Accessorizing is Mandatory
Back in your hometown, I’m sure you rarely, if ever, thought of body parts like your neck or fingers or ears as needing special weather protection. Now is the time to give them some love, so your fingers don’t turn blue and your ears don’t fall off. Invest in gloves and headgear! Get a scarf! It’s about more than just a fashion statement — it’s about SURVIVAL.
Onions have Layers, Ogres have Layers, Winter Clothes have Layers
While you’re reinventing yourself in college, it may be tempting to dress to impress. But come below-freezing temperatures, it’s better to walk into class looking like the Pillsbury Doughboy than to catch hypothermia on your way there. Dress in layers! Think thermal underwear, leggings, and multiple pairs of warm socks.
If I’ve worried you, don’t fret! You’ll likely survive this winter, either because you’ve done your research and come prepared, or because your roommates will take pity on you and lend you some hand-me-downs. Sure, you won’t always be able to walk around in a t-shirt and shorts, but it’ll all be worth it when, in the dead of winter, you see the look on your snowman’s face and get that warm feeling inside.
