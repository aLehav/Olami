There is a cornucopia of bad romance novels in this world, sold with soft covers featuring muscular chests. Anti-romances, however, are much harder to come by. (A bad romance is a story — albeit poorly written — about attraction. An anti-romance is a story about repulsion.)
Kristen Roupenian’s sour-tinged story “Cat Person” — which appeared in the December 2017 issue of The New Yorker — is one of the rare anti-romances I have ever had the pleasure of reading.
Here is the spiel for those the story failed to reach with its Twitter virality: Margot is just shy of the drinking age, and her love interest Robert is somewhere in the vague territory of his thirties. Robert is at least old enough to own a house, where Margot ends up one night after a few weeks of flirting, only to decide that she really, really, really does not want to have sex with this bearded and bellied man.
And yet she says nothing, because she is well-trained, like most women, in the art of tact — and there is no tactful way in the whole wide world to save both her and Robert’s dignity. When the former is sacrificed, the ensuing encounter becomes unpleasant and even gruesome.
To me, the beauty of anti-romances is that they are simultaneously mangled and elegant, concurrently clumsy and nimble. It is a remarkable feat, after all, for an author to deconstruct something that has already collapsed.
In “Cat Person,” the weapon of mass destruction is the female gaze. Prior to reading this piece, I had thought that the female gaze was the exact opposite of its male counterpart — namely, the deconstruction of men into abs, pecs, and other body parts.
But in Roupenian’s story, the female gaze is a kind of visual gymnastics — an optical boomerang. It’s the phenomenon whereby a woman sees her own self through the male gaze.
Roupenian writes, “[Margot] let herself be folded against [Robert], and she was flooded with the same feeling she’d had outside the 7-Eleven — that she was a delicate, precious thing he was afraid he might break.” And then again: “In his eyes, she could see how pretty she looked, smiling through her tears in the chalky glow of the streetlight, with a few flakes of snow coming down.”
Margot’s line of vision doesn’t focus on Robert, but rather on herself. She sees herself through his eyes — “in his eyes,” in fact. Robert is merely a mirror or streetlight. She witnesses herself in the glow of the male gaze as something delicate, precious, and tearfully pretty. “Look at this beautiful girl, [Margot] imagined him thinking,” Roupenian writes. “The more she imagined his arousal, the more turned-on she got.”
But the female gaze, in all its contortions, can easily collapse romance into anti-romance — especially during sex. Roupenian writes, “[Margot] felt like a doll again, as she had outside the 7-Eleven, though not a precious one now—a doll made of rubber, flexible and resilient, a prop for the movie that was playing in his head.”
Trapped in Robert’s head, Margot dissociates. She experiences something reminiscent of sleep paralysis, where she is obliged to look down at her frozen body from above. Romance is reciprocal, but a doll, a prop, an object — even an object of desire — can’t reciprocate.
Robert becomes what he does to her. He becomes repulsing; revolting. And anti-romance is born.
Strange as it sounds, Roupenian’s story of dubiously consensual and definitely bad sex gave me hope. It gave me hope because it tried to make men see what is — to most of them — invisible.
Ultimately, I do not expect men to channel the female gaze. I do not expect them to adopt double vision. And I do not expect them to exist with one foot in the parallel, anti-world. But I would like for them to wonder about it, like I pondered as a child what it would be like to be a spider and have four eyes.
Reading romance is escapist, a chance to forget I am a spider. But I prefer anti-romance — the obsessive, unhappy unraveling of attraction. It reminds me that I am not the only spider on the wall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In June, I watched “500 Days of Summer” alone on my bed. I cringed as Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), head-over-heels in love, decides to stay in a relationship with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), who’s made it clear from the beginning that she doesn’t want anything serious.
Later in the movie, a while after Summer finally breaks up with Tom, he bumps into her, and sees that she is engaged. He is devastated. Summer had previously mentioned to Tom that she “doesn’t believe in relationships” — and here she is, about to get married.
“Either she’s an evil, emotionless, miserable human being, or she’s a robot,” Tom says.
***
Last week, I had dinner with a friend. He told me how, in computer science, there’s a problem called the stable matching problem, where, given ranked preferences between two sets, you want to find a set of matches — mappings from an element in one set to an element in the other — where, in each match, neither element prefers any other element more than the one to which it is already matched.
He told me that there’s a way to solve this problem by having one set be the “choosers” and one set be the “acceptors.” In each round of the algorithm, each “chooser” proposes to match with the “acceptor” that it prefers most, and if the “acceptor” prefers the “chooser” more than every other element that has previously proposed to it, they get “engaged.” This algorithm continues until everyone is engaged. In this case, everyone is guaranteed to end up with a match, and all the matches are guaranteed to be stable.
This algorithm seems similar to how traditional heterosexual relationships start, when men “choose” and women “accept.” In real life, men ask women out, and women choose from a pool of men who are interested in them. For each woman, the “rounds” continue until she finds someone who is better than everyone else she’s dated.
And what about the results? My friend told me that when pairs are matched this way, men, the “choosers,” end up with the best possible women for them, while the women, the “acceptors,” end up with the worst possible men.
And he said that this result always happens; it’s the way the algorithm works.
***
I was talking with another friend earlier this month. We talked about the idea of “settling.” This topic has come up in multiple conversations with multiple friends, even though we are in our early twenties and we have years of dating ahead of us.
“I think women settle when they don’t date enough people before they get married,” she said. “They become content with the option that they already have, and they don’t know that there are other, better options out there.”
“Maybe we should ask people out more often; date more people,” I said. “Maybe that will lower our chance of settling.” I thought about about the stable matching problem again. As women, how can we get what we want if we can only pick from men who want us first?
***
I didn’t like Summer when I watched the movie. She seemed like the girl I never was: too perfect, too organized, too professional. I also didn’t like her relationship decisions. Why couldn’t she just have left the relationship when she realized she didn’t like him that much? Why did she have to break his heart in such a seemingly cruel way?
After I watched the movie, summer came and passed. June, July, August. My own dating life waxed and waned. I drifted even further and further from the version of Summer Finn that the movie portrayed. My friends and I called frequently; we talked about love and loss and friendship.
It’s mid-August now, and I have also been a little bit heartbroken. Maybe that is why, now, I have been thinking more about Summer and the stable matching problem. Maybe I should look at Summer differently, I think. Maybe she doesn’t deserve all of the blame.
The solution to the stable matching problem puts women at a natural disadvantage — they end up with men they comparatively prefer less, after all. Maybe Summer is noncommittal because she is aware of this disadvantage, and believes what my friend said — that women can decrease their likelihood of “settling” by dating more people.
And Summer’s clear to Tom about her intentions: She mentions on multiple occasions that she isn’t looking for something serious, that she doesn’t believe in love at first sight.
But at the same time, Tom consistently acts like he can change her. He gets obsessive. His life starts revolving around the idea of her, the idea of falling in love. He never really thinks of Summer as a real person.
I find a tweet where Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Tom, writes:
“Watch it again. It’s mostly Tom’s fault. He’s projecting. He’s not listening. He’s selfish. Luckily he grows by the end.”
Maybe that’s why Summer doesn’t take Tom seriously.
I still don’t know if we should be more like Summer. But I think we can all learn from her. The movie, after all, is told from Tom’s perspective, and focuses on Tom’s obsession and heartbreak. Of course we would sympathize with Tom, because when Summer ends the relationship, we see Tom’s pain on the screen, not Summer’s. However, Summer’s perspective is just as, if not even more, valid: In a dating system where the odds are against her, she might just be trying to overcome the odds.
I wonder why I didn’t realize this the first time I watched the movie.
***
The stable matching problem is a model. And models for real-life phenomena aren’t perfect. But I think that, just like we can learn from Summer, we can learn from the stable matching problem, because it very roughly quantifies how women and men choose their partners, and can help us understand what kind of power dynamics — in a system where men are the initiators and women are the acceptors — are in place. So despite its imperfections, the stable matching problem gives us a reference point to which we can compare what we see and experience in real life. It makes us more aware of our own biases, of how we feel about and how we perceive relationships that don’t necessarily fit into the dynamics we expect.
My first reaction after watching “500 Days of Summer” was that I didn’t like Summer for sending mixed signals, for not committing, for always looking for someone better, and that I didn’t like Tom, either, for being too obsessed with love. But how would I feel if the genders were reversed — if the man were more noncommittal, and the woman were more anxious, and, dare we say, “clingy” — would my societally pre-programmed brain be more comfortable with these traits, because they’re more familiar to me? Would I find less fault in them; would I feel like the pairing were less deeply flawed, and more as a natural byproduct of society? And what if the movie had been told from the female perspective instead? Would I still have such negative feelings about Summer?
Taylor Swift, having been criticized for more than a decade for her “serial dating” habits, sings on her new album “Lover” about how she would be publicly perceived if she were a man: “I would be complex, I would be cool / They’d say I played the field before I found someone to commit to / And that would be okay for me to do,” she says. Maybe Summer, too, instead of being a selfish and emotionless commitment-phobe, is merely “playing the field”; maybe she is just trying to succeed in a system where the stable matching problem says that she won’t. I want to believe that women don’t have to have Summer’s traits to find a partner they are happy with. But maybe her strategy works: In the movie, she ends up with the love of her life, after all. I still don’t like Summer that much, but maybe we shouldn’t fault her for what she does.
My friends and I talk and theorize, but in reality, I don’t know how scientifically relevant the stable matching problem is in the context of heterosexual relationships — I looked it up, and I couldn’t find much. But, after thinking about Summer for a while, I thought back to the conversations my female friends have had about “settling.” Then, I asked the other friend, the male friend who told me about the matching problem in the first place, whether he’d ever worried about the concept of settling for someone in a relationship — whether he’s even thought about it.
He answered with a clear and definitive “no.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time I was Team Anything, I was eleven years old and reading “Twilight," which had been forbidden to me by my mother. (Regrettably, I was Team Edward; we all know now that the correct team is Alice.) Despite its many, widely acknowledged faults, “Twilight” was the beginning of my own passionate attachment to young adult fiction, and it had an impact on the trope that I read and watched in what felt like real time: the rise of the love triangle.
Romantic drama has and always will be a hallmark of media for teens and young adults. But the wave of late-2000s YA that followed “Twilight” very often featured this particular kind of drama. You know the story: There’s a girl, thrown into some kind of strange (often supernatural) situation, and she’s torn between the guy next door and the mysterious guy. The most cynical part of me thought even then that it was a pretty transparent way to keep fans invested in the romantic subplot of a series. If there was another love interest in the background, no relationship was safe, so you had to keep reading.
Here’s the thing: I hated it. Oh, I loved every other YA trope — I still do. But love triangles made me queasy. I was always terrifically nervous that I would pick the wrong guy, and all my emotional investment would’ve been a waste. And I hate being wrong! Worse, what if I had to defend why I was Team Gale or Team Ash or Team Will? I couldn’t make good arguments. It was just a gut feeling.
But I was also perversely drawn to them. Love triangles turn the experience of reading a romantic subplot into a breathless, intense game of extremes. I couldn’t stand Seth; Adrian was so wrong for Rose; and don’t even mention Mal to me. It was… well, it was just as absurd and dramatic as being a teenager is, played out in fiction. And getting the heroine’s endgame right was a rush like figuring out a plot twist or solving the book’s mystery.
Somewhere in between the cynical and the emotional, though, is a sweet spot of thematic goodness that the best love triangles find. If you don’t read YA, you might not know that the love interests (now not always two guys vying for one girl!) in a love triangle almost always represent something bigger. The choice is always an earthshaking one because it isn’t just about love. Some books don’t stick the landing and so that choice feels flat, the stakes cartoonish. But others compel the character to reflect what kind of person they want to be. What do they stand for, and could they live with a partner who feels otherwise? As Suzanne Collins wrote about her “Hunger Games” heroine: “Katniss isn’t just deciding on a partner; she’s figuring out her worldview.”
With all the expected caveats (a person you date as a teenager is not necessarily the last; it is mostly in speculative settings that the choice has such grave consequences), the love triangle is another facet of the protagonist’s coming-of-age. As maligned as the trope is, it even makes sense from a craft standpoint: It provides conflict, appears external but engages with the internal, and often reveals more about the protagonist’s goals than can be explicitly said in the narrative. Yes, I hate being wrong, but I am grudgingly satisfied by these conclusions, the “Mockingjays” and “Ruin & Risings” among us.
Really, a YA love triangle is spectacular solipsism, and not because it features attractive people fighting over the protagonist. It is a happy selfishness that feels entirely appropriate to fiction for teenagers. It exaggerates a world in which pursuing someone is nerve-wracking and exciting and terrifying — because now you’re in love with a ghost or joining the merfolk-human conflict. And the lessons that the love triangle canon teaches are so varied: Don’t pick the person who stifles your personality; don’t pick the guy who’s controlling and manipulative; don’t pick the girl who refuses to accept who you are. This cliché has never been what I thought it was. And if the question the love triangle encourages (especially young) readers to think, who will I be if I do or say or think this… I can get behind that, no matter how stressed out Peeta fans make me.

“But that wasn’t what made her stare. He had the most beautiful face she had ever seen.” As the charming Will Herondale made his entrance in Cassandra Clare’s “The Infernal Devices,” I immediately rolled my eyes. This was obviously the handsome, literary hero who Tessa Gray, the damsel-in-distress, will inevitably fall for and be with by the end of this supernatural tale. However, the plot surprisingly deviates from this cliché beginning, complicating an otherwise formulaic romance narrative.
“The Infernal Devices,” the Victorian-era prequel trilogy to “The Mortal Instruments,” chronicles the journey of teenage bibliophile Tessa Gray, who is taken in by the Shadowhunters, a group of warriors sworn to protect humans from demons and police the Downworld. Tessa starts to develop feelings for two parabatai (best-friend-cum-warrior-partners), Will and Jem, as she is relentlessly pursued for her unique ability to shape-shift. At a time in my life when I myself had multiple crushes at the same time, this series presented a love story that challenged my perceptions of monogamy and morality. Tessa, throughout the course of the series, gets the chance to be with each of the male protagonists and to fall in love with each of them for who he really is. Unlike in other YA novels, Clare fully explores the relationships between the three vertices of this epic young-adult love triangle without ultimately side-lining any character’s affections by forcing them to choose one love.
Tessa is not, in fact, a damsel-in-distress, as she establishes herself as a strong female protagonist by voicing her unfiltered thoughts (and shamelessly throwing a water jug at her handsome rescuer). Her coming-of-age character arc shows how she learns to listen to her intuition rather than others when making choices. Throughout the series, Tessa has a little voice in her head counseling virtue and caution (which belongs to her late Aunt Harriet), which tells her to cast Will out of her heart when he indulges in unscrupulous behavior; this turns out to be the reason why Tessa, normally the most insightful character to occupy the Institute, cannot adequately diagnose Will’s problems (namely, a demon’s curse). Similarly, Tessa almost doesn’t realise the feelings she has for the terminally-ill Jem, nearly friend-zoning him, a more socially acceptable alternative to being ‘forward’ by pursuing someone romantically. However, Aunt Harriet’s voice is eventually silenced when Tessa realises that the reason her brother, revealed to be Aunt Harriet’s illegitimate child, betrays Tessa because he never knew the truth of his parentage. “It is better to know the truth,” Tessa says gravely to Jem at the end of “Clockwork Angel.”
Despite the hilarious one-liners and homey vibe of the London Institute, these three characters still struggle with jealousy and other negative emotions. Although it is mildly frustrating how Will and Jem never realize that they love the same girl, Will is eventually able to profess his love for Tessa, but is just a little too late because she got engaged to Jem merely hours before. While readers often feel intense pity toward the spurned lover, Clare complicates this formula by also directing our sympathies towards Tessa, who loves Will and Jem, but decides to hide her feelings for Will to give him a chance to move on while protecting the fairytale ending Jem thought he’d never have. I’m always so fond of confessing my feelings and being forthright about my opinions, but this bittersweet ending taught me that hiding your feelings, when it’s important for a third person to have closure to their pain, can be just as noble as waxing eloquent all the reasons you love someone.
The love story in the ‘The Infernal Devices’ series also questions the standard of having just one soulmate. Sure, Will is insane (with a method to his madness) and Jem is, well, too perfect. But instead of forcing Tessa to choose between the two boys she loves, or for Will and Jem to choose their romantic love over their friendship, these three characters overcome all obstacles only because of their complicated three-way love. Later in the series, Tessa discovers that she is immortal, and Jem joins an immortal fraternity of Shadowhunters to halt his illness until a cure can be found, allowing Tessa and Will to spend a lifetime together, and Tessa and Jem to be together in the future. I remember feeling irritated at Clare, who was reluctant to make her protagonists choose, but I later realized that Tessa being with both Will and Jem is not a cop-out; instead, this ending allows the author to explore each relationship fairly, and the supernatural element in the novel is perhaps most exemplified by this untraditional ending. In the world of “The Infernal Devices,” as long as your feelings are genuine, the strength of your love is enough to assure you a happy ending — even if it takes you 129 years to get there.
Although Clare steers clear of dealing with Tessa’s polyamorous tendencies and the parabatai bromance that some fans perceive as homosexual (though she explores these relationship types with other characters in the Shadowhunter universe), she manages to portray all the love felt by each character as valid and treasured, instead of dismissed as the third vertex that is usual in YA. And this is why everytime I leaf through “Clockwork Angel” and read Will Herondale’s swaggering opening scene, I smile, remembering my own arrogance to assume that I could see all the way to the end of this amazing story, which had me rooting for the people behind the romance, and made me wonder what it would be like to love with such integrity.

If The Beatles had stumbled on the 18th century Gujarati poet named Nishkulanand Swami (1766–1848), they might have realized that their hit single “All You Need Is Love” is much more than a memorial to a historical moment of counterculture. It is a resounding residue of the cross-continental consciousness of humanity, insisting that love — sincerity, affection, and the myriad ways in which the emotion has found appellation — is what fulfills, both compensating for inadequacy and transforming proficiency into resplendency. It is no secret, and no great insight.
And yet, that people come repeatedly to the same conclusion from within unique contexts and still find it worth announcing anew tints with rose the contexts themselves, which are amenably shaped and therefore overrun by love. One such context is that of religious poetry, which we can take to be musings on faith, doubt, self-awareness, duty, purpose, or meaning, and often finds itself artfully expressed by writers acknowledging or personally engaging with religious and spiritual traditions.
As a child growing up under the auspices of the devotional Swaminarayan Hindu tradition, I learned of this line of poetry from within Nishkulanand Swami’s massive literary corpus: “Sakhī, bhūdhara bhūkhyo che bhāvano.” My friend, God is hungry for love. The line draws on imagery forged in practices such as “thāḷa,” in which devotees offer food to consecrated images of the divine. It is a practice which has forms as elaborate as the new year’s day Annakut, for which sometimes thousands of varieties of dishes are organized and festively decorated, or forms as communal as the distribution of sweets sanctified through the ritual after the birth of a child.
It is in action that the ritual comes to life. That is, the ritual represents the fact that humans offer that which is most basic for life first to God. But it is through poetry, like that of Nishkulanand Swami’s, that the ritual’s essence is distilled — that is, humans can utilize the only language they possess to signify the giving of something more precious, less material — love. All this, nuanced in its theological intellection but cherished straightforwardly by devotees, is encapsulated in a phrase of 11 syllables.
Nishkulanand Swami was a brilliant exegete, writing more prolifically on detachment, discipline, and asceticism. Yet it was this small phrase of his devotional poetry, lyrically simple, that was often quoted in our household when I cried because the cookies I was baking for our local Annakut were squarish and flat. It was this line that my mom sang when we were away from home and it was time to pray but lighting a lamp was an obvious fire hazard. We reminded each other of it when circumstances felt dark or inscrutable, when resources and outcomes were especially meager. It was this phrase of poetry that grew like a pool of sunlight deep in my heart, warm and ever-reassuring that despite the very complicated materials and rules characteristic of certain Hindu rituals, God really only wanted love. My age, gender, and caste did not matter. All I really needed was love.
It seems profoundly easy, given the comforting ubiquity of the statement that can be monopolized neither by flower children nor by religious people. Yet, it is not lost on me that as much as it was first a poetry fragment that became the basis for my conviction, so too would its enaction be a work of art. The life that embodies pure love is like a sculpture or a piece of music. It is beautiful to look at, but it demands painstaking diligence. Sometimes I would snooze my alarm and come flying from my room in the mornings, intending also to fly through prayers so that I would not be late to school. I would laugh at the table, having finished a 15-minute prayer in five or even three, and say, bhūdhara bhūkhyo che bhāvano, right, Mom? Or, I would be assigned from school a pledge form for United Way and send it to my dad’s work, where his colleagues would sign it dutifully. I would take back to school a filled form, wearing a proud smile for my magnanimous contribution. My mom would remind me, bhūdhara bhūkhyo che bhāvano, and tell me that by having people sign their names on a form I had given nothing of my own.
Over and over, this piece of poetry compels me even now — mostly in contexts other than giving food to God, which is only ultimately a lesson in this — to keep my heart in the right place, regardless of external correctness or incorrectness, goodness and badness, ease and difficulty. Consistent, inner love for the Universe is in this way not a continuous transaction. It is an equilibrium, a manner of existence that, in the end, hungers for nothing at all.

Dear reader,
We get it: Love is the stuff of pop song cliché. It’s a many-splendored thing, an open door, a verb. Done incorrectly, romance becomes schmaltzy, trite, and tasteless. Think Nicholas Sparks movie posters of attractive, heterosexual, white couples centimeters away from locking lips. Or kitschy paperback bodice-rippers on gas station stands. Or irritating pop songs that, having overstayed their welcome on the radio, become the anodyne white noise of grocery store aisles and department store clearance racks. In a pop culture oversaturated by romance, it wouldn’t be irrational to detest art about love. After all, romance has been done so many times, it ought to have expired with the hundredth Shakespearean sonnet.
And yet… Pop songs about love still dominate the airwaves. Romance novels account for one-fifth of adult fiction sales. And though the golden era of romantic comedies is arguably behind us, a new one surfaces every now and then that restores our faith in the genre. Or, in the words of impassioned Internet thinkpieces, even portends a renewal of the genre at large. But why? Why aren’t we tired of it all? Why are we still captivated by a centuries’ old artistic mode that ought to be totally banal and uninteresting by now?
Because art about love — when done right — is as fresh and exciting as love itself.
Earlier this summer, that was precisely what we wanted to hear about. We wanted to know the art that shaped the ways you thought about love, whether articulated in the verse of 18th century Hindu poetry or splashed across the pages of young adult novels. We wanted the artistic loves that kept you reading or listening — or the on-screen unrequited love that kept you guessing. And lucky for us, that’s exactly what we got. Thanks to our thoughtful contributors, we heard about the philosophies of love from artists ranging from Amy Winehouse, to Caravaggio, to the Arctic Monkeys, and more.
Thank you to the Crimson Arts board for bringing this supplement to fruition, particularly our wonderful execs, who devoted the last few days of summer to editing these pieces.
We hope you enjoy reading!

We all dread this question. It’s what makes us start sweating when we arrive home during break (though for some of us, that may just be due to the summer heat of where we live). It’s what makes or breaks the first five minutes of those ephemeral interactions between prefrosh during Visitas. Ironically, it’s also what we face during dreaded networking events — the purpose of which, ironically, is to secure us with jobs so that we can actually attempt to answer this question.
Yet what limits us to regard what we do simply in terms of our profession or academic discipline? For many of us, we may not have an internship offer lined up for the next three summers; we may be struggling to find options for the upcoming summer alone. In these cases of job insecurity, are we simply not doing anything? When faced with the question, do we just sit in silence?
I sometimes wonder how I would have answered this question as an adolescent, when my greatest worry was snagging a spot at the monkey bars. It’s likely I would have enthusiastically responded with the fact that I doodle and build stories for my original character designs. I would ramble about what piece I’m currently learning on the cello or shyly show my growing list of webcomics that I stay updated on every week. In response to “what do you do,” I would say I am an artist, a musician, a reader, and a writer. I would laugh and wonder how one could possibly have just one answer — people are capable of doing many things, after all.
Now, however, I freeze up in front of this question and struggle to dredge up even a single answer. My mind races through a midlife crisis in three seconds, and I balk at the fact that I don’t have a five-year plan to recite to my relatives or a recruiter.
Nonetheless, we are all definitely “doing” something with our lives everyday. We attend a university brimming with opportunities to learn and grow, we take courses on intriguing topics, and we explore new sides of ourselves and invest our time in extracurriculars that support our campus culture. How can it be possible, then, that we don’t know what it is that we do?
Perhaps it is because of the societal perception in which we have grown to regard this question. How unfortunate it is that those with such passion in their eyes must question their own worth because they are not yet sure of their professional future. What if we grew to let go of our expectations regarding this question? What we do should not just be limited to our career prospects or academic concentration. The things we do — the things in which we willingly choose to invest our time, energy, and passion — extend to all aspects of ourselves beyond professional or academic development, be it for personal growth, self discovery, mental health, or recreational enjoyment. With this in mind, it should follow that the question of what we do should accept answers within these fields as well.
So what do I do? Yes, I program and make websites. I concentrate in Computer Science at Harvard College. But no, I also do more than that. I dance with some of the sweetest people I have met on campus. I write my heart out about issues close to my heart for my school’s publication. I take photos of the beautiful crevices in life such as glimpses of sunsets or the aesthetic display of food that people are too busy to fully appreciate. I stay up into the late hours of the night making sure my friends don’t go to bed with a heavy heart. These are also things I do, and they are just as valid and important as my four-year academic plan.
Despite how it may feel, we are all so more than our concentrations or professional experiences. We are fighters, dreamers, scholars, lovers, and envisionaries. We laugh, we cry, we learn, and we grow. The next time we are faced with the question of “what do you do,” it is my hope that rather than feeling boxed in, we are bursting with answers of everything we are and everything we are capable of.

If you ask any undergraduate about their concentration, you will likely hear about the courses they have taken, the problems they have been asked to think about, and the methods they have been taught to use. Economics students will mention their econometrics classes, students in the sciences will describe the work they have done in labs, and students in the humanities and other social sciences will describe a myriad of research and writing conventions that set each of their disciplines apart from the others.
These methodological silos are important, and it is appropriate that undergraduate concentrators understand the epistemology and the expectations of their discipline. Concentrations can and should instill that knowledge. Learning each discipline equips students to read and eventually produce academic work that can engage with broader conversations in their disciplines.
Ultimately, the purpose of teaching method is to enable the study of complex problems in conversation with others in the discipline who have studied those problems already. Biology concentrators may hope to go to medical school, economics concentrators may hope to consult or study public policy, engineers may hope to learn the way the complex material world around us is constructed, and to work at the forefront of that world, building the engineering solutions to the future that may help alleviate poverty, combat climate change, or simply increase our standard of living.
Still, why limit that conversation within the discipline? None of these problems — providing healthcare, alleviating poverty, or combating climate change — is best understood in the isolation of a single way of thinking. Doctors’ work can be made more impactful by the work of policy experts, Environmental Science & Engineering concentrators who want to build a climate-proof future need the help of earth and climate scientists, as well as economists. History’s attempts to understand the arc of the past are incomplete without the tools of literature, archaeology, and anthropology for understanding the social and material character of a culture.
Real life is interdisciplinary. The kinds of questions we will confront as adults in the world may not be solvable within the confines of a single discipline. That is not to say these disciplinary strictures are not worth learning. They are, and Harvard should continue to teach them. But our courses should also reflect an understanding of the kinds of problems we will be asked to face.
That means that being conversant in the methods and insights of complementary disciplines at some basic level should be part of the educational approach of all concentrations. This learning can even be done in the context of posing complex problems that require us to consider what insights other disciplines might have. Programs like the General Education requirements already seek to do this to some extent, and their efforts are laudable, but deserve expansion. Engineering students might study the process of scaling up structural innovations to the entire economy, pre-med students might examine the challenge of delivering affordable, equitable, high-quality healthcare to everyone, and government students might consider the process of solving a salient political problem, like gun violence, in the context of public health. Such an approach has the added benefit of asking students to consider realistic, meaningful scenarios to connect their work to the real world, as well as encouraging interdisciplinary thinking.
The Embedded EthiCS program, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the philosophy and computer science departments, is an encouraging step in this direction. It recognizes and preserves the centrality of excellence in the core discipline — Computer Science — but forces students to reckon with the ethical implications of the systems that others before them have designed and they will soon go on to manage themselves. An even more impressive step would be to put those ethical discussions in the context of policy dilemmas in the sphere of big tech. One professor in the program has already expressed hope that the approach will encourage reflection for those in it who may seek careers in government.
Methodological and academic divisions represent genuine differences in approaching the hard questions of the world today. Those differences are legitimate, and it is important for students to develop real expertise in the methodologies of their field of choice. But it cannot be the only priority. To prepare students to tackle the challenges we hope to overcome as a society in the coming decades and beyond, Harvard should encourage us to think about real-life problems. In so doing, the University will spur us to discover insights that disciplines we never bothered to examine before have to offer and to marshal as many ways of thinking as possible.
As well as pedagogically useful, this approach has a deeper benefit. Knowing from real, lived experience that your own way of thinking will not yield as full an understanding of a complex issue as addressing it from multiple perspectives is simply a useful life lesson. Skepticism about the totality of one’s own expertise, willingness to listen to diverse perspectives, and the ability to understand how different thought processes yield different conclusions foster intellectual rigor, inclusive collaboration, and plain old empathy. Learning those lessons should be as much a goal of our time at Harvard as any others.

Harvard’s museums are a centerpiece of our university’s intellectual offerings, and rightfully so — their collections are vast and provide students an opportunity to study art and artifacts from around the world, just a few feet from their dorms. However, many of the items in Harvard’s museums were acquired before international restrictions on the expropriation of cultural artifacts were imposed and with disregard for countries’ preservation of their native culture. While Harvard’s collections are impressive, they were often taken at times when their native cultures were neither highly protected nor regarded. Harvard must return any such artifacts and hold all its collections to the same standards.
Visit the Peabody Museum in particular and one can explore the world through an ethnographic lens. You can find beautiful, intricate and breathtaking artifacts from countries around the world and from native nations in this country. Many of these collections are not new. The Peabody Museum was founded in the 19th century and has long housed collections from around the world. However, its older collections are troublesome because of how they came to rest in Cambridge.
The museum is largely a testament to imperialism — opened in 1866, a few years before the rise of the United States as an imperial power, and at a time when wealthy Americans could plunder foreign lands seemingly at-will with few protections for countries whose cultural and ethnographic heritage was being stolen. Through these collections, Harvard and its students today benefit from the spoils of imperialism and colonialism that maimed and depleted the resources and populations of countries around the world.
As such, these artifacts should not be Harvard’s to keep. Though Harvard might legally own all the items in its collection, their origins might largely be incompatible with modern international standards.
The Peabody Museum currently requires proof of the provenance of donated or acquired items, and the Harvard Art Museums’ policy states that it “will not acquire an object if there is reasonable cause to believe that, since November 17, 1970, it may have been stolen, illegally excavated or removed from a monument, site, or wreck contrary to local law or otherwise acquired in or exported from its country of origin or any intermediate country, in violation of that country’s laws or any international treaties.” The seemingly arbitrary date originates from the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. While this prohibition on the acquisition of stolen artifacts is an important step toward ensuring that countries retain and preserve their own culture and heritage, this rule does not apply retroactively to the immense amount of items collected before this date.
Harvard’s museums should apply their current standards of refusing stolen or wrongfully expropriated art not just to new acquisitions but to their entire collections.
The Peabody Museum has an extensive collection of prehistoric artifacts from Costa Rica, my own home country. These artifacts reveal an incredible amount about the abilities and artistry of the first Americans, but Costa Ricans who do not have the means to travel to Cambridge will never have the opportunity to view their ancestors’ work because Harvard owns them.
One of the biggest items in Harvard’s collection from the small Central American country is the “Diquís Ball,” a 4,800 pound stone sphere made some time between 700 and 1300 C.E. Today, Harvard would not be able to expatriate that artifact from Costa Rica. The country’s current law prohibits the movement of these spheres from their resting place and considers them “patrimonio nacional,” national heritage that belongs to the state. Yet, because Harvard’s collections were put together centuries ago, this and many other items are exempt from laws seeking to protect cultural artifacts and to preserve national heritage around the world.
This is not an issue unique to our university’s museums. There have been and will continue to be calls from around the world to American museums for them to return and repatriate articles with foreign origins. Our university should take the lead on this issue – our museum collections should always be a source of pride for Harvard and the United States, but our pride must not come at the cost of other countries’ ability to preserve their native art.
As a leader in higher education, Harvard has the moral responsibility to lead the repatriation of cultural artifacts and set an example for other museums to follow, returning these works to their native lands. Though it may greatly diminish our collections, this a correction long overdue for centuries of American and European looting that stole aboriginal culture in the name of museums, preservation and education.
It’s time we accept the fact that our collections house stolen culture and act to right this centuries-old wrong.

Harvard freshman Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, who United States border officials turned away ten days ago, arrived on campus Monday in time for the start of classes Tuesday.
Ajjawi’s family issued a statement Monday through his lawyer thanking those who voiced support for him and assisted his arrival.
“The last ten days have been difficult and anxiety filled, but we are most grateful for the thousands of messages of support and particularly the work of AMIDEAST,” the statement reads. “We hope now that everyone can respect our and Ismail’s privacy and he can now simply focus on settling into College and his important class work.”
Immigration officers barred Ajjawi from entering the United States after he spent eight hours in Boston Logan International Airport on Aug. 23. Ajjawi, a 17-year-old resident of Tyre, Lebanon told The Crimson last week that a Customs and Border Protection officer searched his phone and laptop while he was detained at the airport.
Ajjawi alleged that officer questioned him for hours about posts his friends made on social media and eventually informed him that his visa would be canceled. The officer also allegedly asked him questions about his religious practices in Lebanon.
Shortly after Ajjawi returned to Lebanon, Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Michael S. McCarthy wrote in a statement that officials had “deemed [him] inadmissible.” McCarthy did not specify the reason for the decision.
Ajjawi’s immigration difficulties sparked outcry from Harvard student groups, several of which organized a petition supporting him that has garnered more than 7,000 signatures as of Monday night. Ajjawi's story has also drawn international media attention and elicited statements of support from several organizations including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
Staff from both Harvard and AMIDEAST, a scholarship organization sponsoring Ajjawi’s education, worked with federal officials to ensure he could matriculate on time.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in a statement last week that Harvard was working to bring Ajjawi to campus before classes begin Sept. 3.
“The University is working closely with the student’s family and appropriate authorities to resolve this matter so that he can join his classmates in the coming days,” he wrote.
The Ajjawi family’s statement acknowledged the groups that advocated for their son, both in Lebanon and in the United States.
“We truly appreciate the efforts of so many individuals and officials in Lebanon, Washington, Massachusetts and at Harvard that have made it possible for our son Ismail Ajjawi to begin his studies at Harvard with his class,” they wrote.

​​​​​​
When a former student went job hunting and asked Harvard Divinity School professor Anne E. Monius for a generic recommendation, Monius insisted upon writing a tailored recommendation for each job — all 60 of them.
Students and colleagues say Monius, who died on Aug. 3 at the age of 54, was an extraordinary teacher who closely mentored her students while conducting groundbreaking research.
Monius was a professor at the Divinity School for 17 years, during which she taught about the history and writings of South Asian religions. She joined the Divinity School faculty in 2002, after teaching at the University of Virginia for five years, and earned tenure two years later.
Monius’s research spanned centuries and multiple religions, a breadth one of her former masters students Sarah Pierce Taylor said is exceptional among academics, who generally have a research focus in one religion and can teach about two others. Monius’s first book “Imagining a Place for Buddhism: Literary Culture and Religious Community in Tamil-Speaking South India” is the “definitive” book on Buddhism, according to Pierce Taylor. She also studied Jainism and co-founded the Jainism group at the American Academy of Religion.
“She had a perspective on her field that really integrated the study of religion and literary texts, and that really brought aesthetics and ethics together,” said Divinity School Professor and interim minister at Memorial Church Stephanie A. Paulsell, who co-taught a course with Monius. “She was really interested in that: the relationship between beauty and goodness, and how ethics and aesthetics worked on each other in the texts that she studied.”
At the time of her death, Monius was working on multiple projects about Shaivism.
“She just was writing this magnum opus, and I only hope that that book can be shepherded to publication because she is a scholar of such immense merit that for us not to have that book would be such an incredible loss to the field,” Pierce Taylor said.
Amidst all of her research projects, Monius was an advisor and mentor to many students, earning the Excellence in Mentoring Award in 2014 from the Graduate School Council for her impact on students.
“Maybe more than any faculty member I’ve ever known, she was extremely generous with her time,” Paulsell said.
Monius often taught six reading courses a semester and was willing to put in time to help any student pursue their research interests, according to Paulsell. She met with thesis advisees each week and successfully led many of her students through applications to Ph.D. programs. Those who learned with her had to be prepared for a rigorous course of study.
“She had very high standards,” Paulsell said. “Now if Anne was your advisor, you knew you had to come in with new writing every week. But the students who wanted to do that really flourished under her guidance.”
In nominating Monius for the Excellence in Mentoring Award, AnnMarie M. Bridges, who studied Christian theology at the Divinity School, described how thoroughly involved Monius was in her personal academic success—even though she was never Monius’s student. Monius not only met with Bridges but also read through hundreds of pages of John Calvin’s writings to prepare for those meetings.
“I know of no other faculty member in my field who regularly spends an hour a week with the students she mentors (and it is worth noting, in this context, that Prof. Monius is not even my advisor),” Bridges wrote in an email. “Prof. Monius does not just lend me her mind when I am sitting in her office; she invests time outside of our meetings to become an even better guide and interlocutor for me.”
Pierce Taylor had a similar story and described how Monius had supported her, even after she graduated from the Divinity School. Over the course of her eight-year-long Ph.D. program, she continued to turn to Monius for advice. Monius read every word and every draft of the dissertation.
“The thing that’s really important to remember is that she was under no institutional obligation to me,” Taylor said. “I was a Ph.D. student at [The University of Pennsylvania], not at Harvard. But she treated me as if I were her responsibility.”
Pierce Taylor later received 60 tailored recommendation letters from Monius while job hunting.
“Anne made me feel incredibly special, she did all of these things for me that changed my life, changed my career, and it was very special,” Pierce Taylor said. “But actually Anne did that for so many people.”
Monius’s generosity extended beyond her students, according to Paulsell. When Paulsell’s daughter returned from a summer spent in India, Monius helped her process the experience and find her footing in American culture. The two sat together on the couch for hours, with Monius listening intently while Paulsell’s daughter shared her experiences.
“I could just see on my daughter’s face this incredible relief, that here was somebody who understood where she’d been, understood the people she’d been with, understood what she had been learning, understood the struggle she was having coming home,” Paulsell said.
Pierce Taylor said she sees Monius as a model for advising and teaching.
“I think the imprint there is hard to describe,” Pierce Taylor said. “I know how to be an advisor, I know how to be a professor, because I saw how Anne did it. And I saw the incredible model that I don’t know if I'm ever going to be able to live up to that, but I know that I want to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​
More than 100 workers and union supporters gathered in Boston’s Copley Square in an annual Labor Day rally in solidarity with immigrant workers on Monday.
Marchers chanted “Sí, se puede” — Spanish for “Yes, we can” — as they paraded down Boylston Street. Over the course of the nearly mile-long walk, advocates voiced support for workers with Temporary Protected Status and legislation enabling immigrant workers to obtain driver licenses.
Members of Harvard’s TPS Coalition, organizers for unions, and Harvard students, held up a banner reading “No borders in the worker’s struggle” during the three-hour long event.
“I'm here today, because I want to keep my family together,” said Doris E. Landaverde, a Harvard custodial staff member from El Salvador who has TPS status and could face deportation if her TPS status expires.
TPS, a humanitarian program administered by the United States Department of Homeland Security, is a designation given to immigrants from certain countries who cannot return home due to circumstances such as ongoing armed conflict and environmental disaster.
Individuals granted TPS are protected from deportation and are able to live and work in the U.S. The Trump administration intends to end TPS protections for individuals from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras and Sudan. That policy is currently facing multiple legal challenges and a court injunction, and has been extended for these countries through January 2020.
​​​​
Jose E. Portillo, another Harvard employee and TPS recipient from El Savaldor, said he hopes one day to gain permanent residency.
Portillo said that working in the U.S. allows him to send money back to El Salvador to support his family. He said he will no longer be able to support his family members studying at El Salvadoran universities if his TPS status expires.
Roxana Rivera — vice president of 32BJ Service Employees International Union which organized the event and represents workers at Harvard — said that it remains unknown what will happen after the TPS extension ends in January.
“That’s why we have to continue to fight in the court,” Rivera said. “We have to actually be educating each other, we have to be marching on the street, we have to be making sure that we're doing everything to make sure that these families are not torn apart.”
Harvard union organizers also joined the march in support of TPS recipients.
Edward “Ed” B. Childs — the former chief shop stewards for UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents Harvard’s dining workers — called the march “extremely significant.”
“It’s the unions calling for unity amongst the unions and community groups to support the TPS struggle,” Childs said. “We see that these struggles interconnect with each other, and TPS is one of the biggest interconnectors — the immigration movement, the anti-racist movement, and the union movement all coming together.”
“That’s why I’m here,” he added.
Rally participants also called for passing the Work and Family Mobility Act through the Massachusetts legislature. If passed, the bill would allow immigrant workers who cannot prove lawful presence or present a social security number to apply for a Massachusetts driver’s license.
“Driving should not be connected to immigration status,” Rivera said. “It’s the safety for everybody...as well as allows people to provide continue providing for their families.”
As the march reached its end, Childs — who retired just last month from Harvard after more than 40 years at the University — said the event was encouraging.
“A lot of the workers are out today. They’re ready to fight,” he said
“An injury to one is an injury to all,” he added.

​​​​​​
Almost two years after a sideline tackle left freshman football player Ben M. Abercrombie ’21-’23 paralyzed from the neck down, he returned to Harvard last month.
Abercrombie, an Alabama native recruited by Harvard from high school football powerhouse Hoover High School, originally entered the College as a member of the Class of 2021. He suffered a broken neck and spinal cord injury in the first game of his Harvard career in fall 2017. The past two years, Abercrombie has undergone multiple surgeries and intensive physical rehabilitation to enable his return this fall as a member of the Class of 2023.
“The goal was always to come back. It was just a matter of when I was healthy enough,” Abercrombie said.
After Abercrombie’s injury, he spent four months recovering in a spinal cord specialty center in Atlanta, Ga., before returning to his home in Hoover. There, he worked out almost daily at the University of Alabama’s Spain Rehabilitation Center to keep his muscles from atrophying while he waits for research scientists to find a way to re-allow his spinal cord functionality.
In preparation for his return, Abercrombie worked with Harvard’s Accessible Education Office, which has provided him with classroom accommodations and a modified dorm room. His family has also shifted medical care to Cambridge.
Nekesa C. Straker, the Senior Assistant Dean of Residential Life and First-Year Students, wrote in an email that the College is “delighted” to welcome Abercrombie back to campus.
“Ben's perseverance and determination to continue his studies in the face of enormous adversity is truly an inspiration, and we are happy to be supportive in any way that we can,” Straker wrote.
Abercrombie is living with his mother — who he fondly described as his roommate — in a modified suite in Weld Hall, complete with a 65 inch flatscreen television gifted to Abercrombie by the Harvard football team’s administrative coordinators.
Abercrombie, who received an “A” in an online Harvard class over the summer, will take two classes this term as he readjusts to life on campus. He has previously stated that completing his Harvard degree has been a goal since the initial injury.
“I'm just excited to get everything going again. It's been a while, and I've been waiting forever to start school again here. I'm just ready to go.”
​​​​​​
Abercrombie’s return has been marked by constant surgeries and doctor’s visits. Just seven months ago, he underwent a surgery to complete a phrenic nerve graft, which he hopes will eventually help him regain his ability to breathe without the help of a ventilator.
He will continue physical rehabilitation in Cambridge. Currently, Abercrombie works out on a specialized bike three times a week in his dorm room to keep his muscles from atrophying, and he will receive treatments at Journey Forward, a Massachusetts-based non-profit that works to improve the lives of those with spinal cord injuries.
While most freshmen spent Orientation Week learning their way around campus and preparing for upcoming classes, Abercrombie also had to plan for his medical care.
“We have to train the new nurses, go to doctor's visits. We're still really busy in trying to establish a schedule,” Abercrombie said. “The main thing you worry about is having enough time to do everything that you need to do on a daily basis while getting your school work done and being successful in school.”
Abercrombie will take two classes this term instead of the normal course load of four classes, as he readjusts to college life. Over the summer, he learned to use technology to read, write, and even solve math equations in preparation for academic coursework.
In addition to his academic focus, Abercrombie remains committed to a full recovery.
“Right now, obviously the main goal is to be healthy and heal up,” he said.
Abercrombie stays up to date with the most current research into spinal cord injuries and is in contact with a pharmaceutical company called NerveGen, which researches treatments for nerve damage.
“They have a really intriguing study and they plan to go into clinical trials in 2020. They have this enzyme that they inject in the spinal cord that will deplete scar tissue around the injury that will allow your body to heal itself,” Abercrombie said.
Despite his injury, Abercrombie plans to continue to be a part of the Harvard football family.
“I just like to be around, be a part of the guys,” he said. “I'll maybe help with analyzing film or something. I'll just be there, be around with the guys and everything. Help out with whatever they need.”
The football team and coaching staff welcomed Abercrombie back to campus last month by hosting a college football watch party. Several players have dropped by his room in Weld to say hello, and Head Football Coach Tim Murphy checked in with Abercrombie and his family when they arrived on campus.
“As usual Ben was incredibly upbeat, chatty and gregarious, a profile in courage. And that is the reason he is such an inspiration to our team and program,” Murphy wrote in an email.
Edward “Isaiah” Wingfield ’21, who plays the same position as Abercrombie, also called Abercrombie an role model.
“It's just really inspiring — staying so positive, for him to stay so positive and having him joke with us. It meant a lot to the team,” he said.
Wingfield, who will return to the field this fall after tearing his ACL last year, said he wears a “Stand Up for Ben” armband every day in honor of Abercrombie.
“Having him on the sidelines with us, in the locker room with us, is just an extra bonus,” Wingfield said. “Knowing how much of a beast that he was out on that field, knowing that he wants to be out there, and us doing it for him and having him inspire us — it's going to do even more as far as bring this team together and make us play harder.”
In between attending class and Harvard football games, Abercrombie plans to continue to work out daily to keep his body in shape for his ultimate goal — to walk again.
“I'm just keeping my body ready to go for when I'm ready to be healed.”

​​​​​​
Roughly thirty freshmen raised signs calling on Harvard to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry as University President Lawrence S. Bacow addressed their class Monday during Harvard’s 11th annual freshman convocation in the Science Center Plaza.
Facing a crowd peppered with orange Divest Harvard signs, Bacow endorsed both student activism and reasoned argument.
“I choose my words intentionally when I say standing up and speaking out are actions. They are often the most difficult when they are most worthwhile,” he said. “You will not regret the time you spend articulating your argument and pushing for change over the next four years.”
Bacow’s remarks echoed those he made last year amid an increasing number of protests organized by Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — two campus groups supporting fossil fuel divestment and divestment from companies with ties to prisons, respectively.
His speech Monday also touched upon his own time as a college freshman in 1969. He recalled watching students protest the Vietnam War as he moved into a MIT dorm.
“It was the height of the Vietnam War, the police were present in riot gear, there were a bunch of students with bull horns, and there was lots of chanting going on,” Bacow said. “My father picked this exact moment to turn to me and say, ‘If you decide to do that, and you get arrested, don't call home.’”
Divest Harvard organizer Ilana A. Cohen ’22 said the group has set an April 22, 2020 deadline for the University to divest, marking Earth Day’s 50th anniversary. She added that they have plans to ramp up their efforts in order to achieve that goal — including recruiting new members from the freshman class.
“We're planning a lot of actions for the upcoming year, particularly because we take this deadline of Earth Day 2020 very seriously,” Cohen said. “Last year was really kind of a question of groundwork organizing, and we've done a lot of recruitment since then.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the signs and calls for divestment.
Before and after the protest, several University administrators joined Bacow in addressing the freshmen.
In a prayer kicking off the event, Harvard Divinity School professor Stephanie A. Paulsell referenced Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, who came to campus Monday after being denied entry to the United States ten days prior. Ajjawi was not on campus at the start of the ceremony.
“Not everybody has arrived on campus today. We pray that soon the entire class will have assembled,” she said.
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana repeated statements from previous convocation addresses, noting that he did not gain admission to the College and urging students to make their time at Harvard “transformational” rather than “transactional.” But he also advised the freshmen to reflect upon Harvard’s motto, “veritas,” and seek difficult truths.
“Sociologists and social psychologists find that conformity, our need for approval and positive feedback, to be one of the most powerful of all social forces. We all have probably experienced that tension between identifying with a particular group and then speaking up or questioning that group,” Khurana said.
“But if we're committed to finding the truth, we need to sincerely engage in listening to those who don't agree with us,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charles Eliot, the longest serving president in Harvard’s long history, was not an ally of expanding college athletics. A proponent of rowing and tennis, the only “clean sports” in his mind, Eliot opposed football and other brutal athletic activities. Even baseball, a relatively clean sport in today’s society, received Eliot’s criticism. The former president once said, “This year I'm told the team did well because one pitcher had a fine curveball. I understand that a curve ball is thrown with a deliberate attempt to deceive. Surely this is not an ability we should want to foster at Harvard.” While Eliot’s understanding of off-speed pitches may have missed the strike zone, he was correct to highlight that the baseball team during his tenure had a skewed moral compass. For some players on the team, the curves off the field proved more troublesome than those on the diamond.
Nearly a half century before Jackie Robinson’s famous debut in 1947, William Clarence Matthews ‘05 defied standards and served as a pioneer in the black baseball community. Despite his modest background as a poor man from Alabama, the future United States Assistant Attorney General worked his way to Phillips Andover Academy and Harvard University to become one of the most talented baseball players of his time. Although his professional career was cut short, succumbing to the racism of the early 20th century, Matthews was able to accomplish major feats for Harvard’s baseball team from 1902 to 1905. While his time at Harvard and after as a baseball standout contains impressive achievements, a more important story regarding race, society, and baseball is tucked within his years as a varsity hero.
Leading up to 1905, Harvard baseball consistently honored the annual tradition of its southern road trip. The Crimson would travel into Dixie to take on teams such as Navy, Virginia, Georgetown, and Trinity (now Duke). These early-season trips allowed Harvard to escape the waning Cambridge winters of early April and play in a more suitable climate. When Matthews joined the Harvard nine, however, the southern trip fell into peril. With a black player on the team, the beginning of the season was now much more complicated than in previous years. From 1902 to 1904, however, Harvard started its season as usual, venturing into territory that was not a part of the Union just 40 years prior. Matthews was left behind, forced to remain in Cambridge so that Harvard’s hosts would not forfeit. Understanding that southern hospitality had its racial limits in early 20th century Virginia, Matthews stayed in Yankee territory without much incident for his first three seasons.
In Matthews’ senior year, however, Harvard elected to start its season in the north, playing Vermont at home in its first game. Harvard’s cancelled trip went without much incident, as the team’s files said nothing of the change, simply recording the new schedule. Harvard’s refusal to make a public spectacle of the previous trips of 1902 through 1904 and cancelled trip of 1905 possibly serve as a testament to its positive reputation with race. Matthews chose Harvard in the first place due to its more progressive record, telling the New York Tribune that he preferred Harvard’s racial climate to Yale’s, a school with “more Southern students.” However, Harvard’s relatively “cleaner” record on race for the time does not tell the entire story of Matthews and the annual southern trip. Harvard still had strong racial divides prevalent in higher education, and a truly progressive team would not have left behind a member of its team due to racist hostility, certainly not after he was an established star. What, then, explains Harvard’s trips without Matthews of 1902 through 1904 and its subsequent cancellation of the southern tour in 1905? While Harvard kept—and possibly recorded at the time—very little within its files regarding Matthews and the southern campaigns, archival materials, media reports, and historiography suggest possible reasons for Harvard baseball’s decision-making during Matthews’ tenure. Due to the rapid growth of Matthews’ notoriety popularized by the media and his impressive athletic performance, Harvard decided against excluding him from the southern visit and thus reconsidered the trip altogether. However, contrary evidence explains why Harvard was delayed in making a statement on the racist south until 1905. Harvard’s role as a fair and just savior, when paired with its ability and tendency to make racist decisions in line with societal norms, could not be completely overcome by these positive factors, allowing Harvard to leave him behind from 1902 to 1904. Matthews did not completely fix Harvard’s role in a sport with a troubled racial past.
The historiography concerning race and baseball from this time period is almost nonexistent. Matthews’ historiography is understandably slim; while important in his time, Matthews does not demand the scholarship of famous black pioneers in the game such as Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson, as he never broke the professional color barrier. Overall, race and baseball in the early 20th century has also gone largely uncovered. Due to the exclusion of blacks from baseball narratives following Major League Baseball’s instituted color barrier in 1887, the American League and National League merger and its inaugural World Series in 1903, and the formation and popularity of the Negro Leagues in the 1920s commanding academic scholarship, race within baseball has been largely ignored from 1887 to 1920. Matthews thus suffers from this lack in coverage. For these reasons, an investigation into Matthews—specifically the racially-charged Harvard baseball team’s southern trips from 1902 to 1905—relies mostly on the available primary sources of archival materials and newspaper articles. By looking at Matthews’ college career, we can examine the early troubles facing black ballplayers in a time devoid of open leagues and full of open racism, where talented black players of all skill levels were left nowhere to turn.
A MEDIA PHENOMENON
Matthews played during an era of waning amateurism and rising professionalism. Independent summer leagues grew as baseball gained popularity, entering its fourth decade in America. College players could join these professional leagues when not in school and play for pay. These professional leagues, chock full of talent, attracted thousands of spectators every summer to see the best young players around. Leagues would even pay, in addition to weekly salaries, to house and feed the players for the summer. These opportunities were available even to black players. While historian Karl Lindholm notes that “as a black man, Matthews would have had a harder time than others” in breaking the rules for these lucrative summer leagues, the actual policing of athletes was subpar, a process described by Lindholm as a “skimpy enforcement of amateur rules.” As commercialism and professionalism of sports grew, scrutiny of the erosion of amateurism began. In the June and July 1905 issues of McClure’s Magazine, journalist Henry Beech Needham examined failing amateur athletics in a lengthy two-part exposé. Needham attacked what he called “evils which destroy sport for sport’s sake.” Not all athletes were guilty, however. Needham gave high praise to “a little colored chap at Harvard” who exemplified the ideal athlete: William Clarence Matthews.
Needham lauded Matthews’ character, a poor man who only received “a Price Greenleaf Aid” grant of $200 freshman year, but since had paid his way through Harvard without the help of baseball paychecks. Matthews worked as a “screen boy” in Memorial Hall, in local hotels, on pulling cars, and as a teacher, rejecting offers of “40 dollars per week and board” in the professional leagues. Needham ends his glowing account with a quote from Matthews: “Mr. [Booker T.] Washington taught us at Tuskegee… that the best help a man can get is an opportunity to help himself.” Needham clearly played on Matthews’ race, referring to the “little colored chap” as a product of hard work and grit, determined to personally succeed in a way that other black athletes or students at the time could not. Needham’s gushing played a large role in Matthews’ career in the early 20th century with the McClure’s piece further elevating his growing image. As the media took ahold and ran with Matthews, his popularity would make it impossible to ignore the racial issues that manifested due to his position on Harvard’s team.
Matthews quickly attracted even more media attention. The standout player was already a regular starter by the end of his freshman season, playing multiple positions in order for the team to fit him into the lineup. Harvard’s new star showed his leadership early on, and his exceptional play baited press coverage. Not only was he dominating competition, but the novelty of a black player on Harvard’s squad also added to his potential for attention. Needham seized on the “little colored chap at Harvard” as a source of inspiration, stirring his character, race, and playing ability into a perfect journalistic stew. Writers licked their chops at opportunities to capitalize on a new phenomenon: a black baseball player at the prestigious Harvard. This offered the opportunity for journalists to create novelistic situations of grit, racial equality, and talent. The formula of presenting a hard-working black player that excelled through determination never seemed to tire. The Boston Globe, upon Matthews’ historic placement on one of the honorary class committees in his senior year, made sweeping claims of his position as a black man on the Harvard baseball team. The article snatches at the opportunity for a popular narrative, stating, “By being placed on the committee he has been made to feel that Harvard has treated him as a man, not as a white man, not as a black man, but as a man, no more, no less, and given him what he earned.” Capitalizing on his rare position as black man at Harvard excelling in a sport dominated by white players, the media consistently found a story in Matthews.
If Matthews served as the machine the media cranked to create its stories, his race was the fuel. As exemplified by McClure’s and the Boston Globe, Matthews’ laudable character and gifted ability, when combined with his position as a black player at Harvard, allowed for a story that kept readers returning even outside of the local area. In the summer following Matthews’ sophomore year, the New York Tribune highlighted the achievements of Matthews and three other black students at Harvard. The Tribune obviously engages in pinpointed journalism to use Matthews as a source of inspiration, starting its story, “The fact that a negro can succeed as an athlete and a student, although he attends one of the richest universities in the world, has been demonstrated at Harvard the last few years.” The Tribune accompanied this praise with a dash of adversity to set up its message, continuing, “When Matthews came to Harvard, there was considerable speculation as to just what his reception would be. All knew of his ability, but some wondered whether or not his color would prevent him from achieving any great success.” Following the reliable recipe, the Tribune continued its admiration of Matthews with a matched admiration for Harvard’s role as a savoir, stating immediately after, “That which followed, however, soon showed that Harvard is decidedly democratic, impartial, and fair.”
This reliable strategy was repeated countless times by many publications, utilizing Matthews as the dependable subject of these narratives. Displaying a hard-working, bright, and talented black student from Harvard as a source of inspiration captivated readers, never seeming to grow old during Matthews’ tenure. Upon the press’s discovery of Matthews’ untapped potential as a source for inspirational stories, his popularity in the newspapers soared. This popularity grew beyond just the local papers, such as the Boston Globe, and expanded across the region, with stories in the New York Tribune and local papers of New Haven, Princeton, and other collegiate cities. As his career continued, the ever-present media made it difficult to sweep issues under the rug, likely contributing to Harvard’s later decisions regarding Matthews and the southern baseball tour.
A GENERATIONAL TALENT
While the excitement around a black baseball player at the country’s oldest university was enough novelty to create a news frenzy, the media fervor was not the only source of his fame. As made evident by the later controversy on his entrance into professional leagues, Matthews was obviously a talented baseball player. With his superior play and command of media attention, Matthews was difficult to ignore, especially when caught in controversy. The young star shined from the beginning, recording two hits, two runs, and a stolen base playing shortstop against the University of Maine in his debut. Matthews excelled his freshman year, scoring the winning run against rival Yale University and earning praise—a rare praise devoid of racial language—from the New York Times for his performance. Matthews continued to dominate throughout his career, leading his team in multiple statistical categories. In his senior season, Matthews recorded a .400 batting average, a feat accomplished at Harvard only seven times in the last 114 years, and stole 22 bases in only 25 games, good enough for fifth-best in Harvard’s record books. The standout left his mark for posterity, not to mention the vast popularity that he gained in his own time.
Matthews’ impressive ability is proved by more than his statistical record. Even with the 1887 ban on black players joining Major League Baseball, many saw Matthews as the player with the best chance to break the color barrier. In his impressive History of Colored Baseball—possibly the most comprehensive account of black players in baseball from 1887 to 1920—Sol White praised Matthews as one of the best black players to ever play. White wrote of Matthews before his attempt to enter professional baseball, “It is said on good authority that one of the leading players and managers of the National League is advocating the entrance of colored players in the National League with a view of signing Matthew [sic], the colored man, late of Harvard.” White was not alone in his praise: Ocania Chalk claims in Black College Sport that “had he [Matthews] been white, the majors would have been fighting to sign up this awesome talent.” Any black player who was pegged as a candidate to break a largely unchallenged color line of 18 years clearly commanded a gift for baseball that could not be ignored. When shunned by the National League, Matthews turned to the Northern League in Vermont, where he further proved his abilities. In the season’s first half, Matthews hit for an average of .314. Upon leaving the Vermont league amid rampant racism, Matthews nearly proved that he truly was the “Jackie Robinson of his age,” as sportswriter Harold Kaese claimed sixty years later. Fred Tenney, the manager of the lowly Boston Beaneaters—later the Boston and then Atlanta Braves—saw Matthews’ talent and attempted to violate the National League’s color barrier by signing Matthews. Tenney saw Matthews’ talent matched with his exemplary character and considered it great enough to overcome baseball’s color line. Alas, Matthews’ potential signing was rebuffed by the rest of the National League, forcing Tenney to back down. While Matthews did not beat Jackie Robinson to integrating baseball, he showcased the talent needed to do so, further proving his achievements as a player.
A “Jackie Robinson of his age” hardly earns this distinction without impressive abilities. Matthews, through his tenure at Harvard, entrance into the Northern League in Vermont, and near break of the National League’s color barrier, proved that he commanded a remarkable set of skills throughout his entire career. Such an extraordinary talent, likened with once-in-a-generation players, could hardly be overlooked for any reason. As fans scoured the box scores for his name, his absence from Harvard’s southern visit would surely be noticed. As he proved his progressively rising athletic ability, it became harder for Harvard to simply hold out a player without comment explaining its capitulation to southern racism. Due to his remarkable playing ability, Harvard came to an unavoidable crossroads in 1905 that it had not seen from 1902 to 1904. The team, in respect of its beloved best player, chose to cancel the southern trip.
A COMPLEX RACIAL PAST
While it is important to note why Harvard chose to cancel its trip in 1905, it is also essential to understand why the team stayed north of Dixie only in Matthews’ final season. Despite the commitment to equality that Matthews saw in Harvard when choosing to attend the institution, Cambridge was not a utopia where Matthews could escape all troubles. Even as one of Harvard’s best players to ever take its field, Matthews never commanded the position of captain. According to the team’s archival material, there is no indication that Matthews was even considered for the job. While the captainship is not a position based solely on playing ability, Matthews had clearly proven his leadership and character throughout his Harvard years. The player touted as “An Example and A Moral” was constantly commended for his superior character on the diamond, in the classroom, and everywhere in between. A man who was praised for “the sedulous manner in which he kept his record clean” surely exemplified the abilities of a captain. While at Andover, Matthews’ race did not stop him from quickly proving his athletic and leadership ability to become the captain of the baseball team, chosen over his white teammates. Even in his second sport, football, in which Matthews could hardly be regarded as the best on the field as he was on the baseball diamond, he was named the first black captain of that Andover team as well. Despite his seemingly perfect mix of athletic and leadership ability, Matthews was not named captain of the Harvard team that he led, most likely due to his race. While it was never clearly indicated by Harvard, the only visible evidence for snubbing Matthews for the leadership position only fit for a white man was the color of skin. Harvard loved to promote its support of Matthews pulling up his own bootstraps, yet would not allow a black man to lead a team of white players. Harvard was only so committed to equality for its players, whether it be in regard to team bureaucracy or a southern trip.
Even the relatively tolerant Ivy League showed racist tendencies, allowing Harvard to keep Matthews at home without protest from 1902 to 1904. Confirming Matthews’ previous suspicions, Yale did not serve as a welcoming environment for Matthews during his tenure with the rival Crimson. Archival clippings from an unmarked newspaper—possibly the Yale Daily News or New Haven Register—rarely complimented Matthews. Even his local papers, the very publications that granted Matthews his fame, were not innocent of occasional racial prejudice, as made apparent by the Boston Herald’s recap of Harvard’s 1905 season finale against Yale. Harvard suffered a resounding 7-2 defeat at the hands of Yale, a game that was essentially finished by the sixth inning. Instead of crediting Yale with an impressive win or pegging Harvard with a team loss, the Herald peculiarly placed blame onto Matthews. In multiple paragraphs throughout the story, the Herald picks on two simple mistakes from Matthews in a game rife with Harvard blunders. The original scorecard from the game faults the Crimson with six errors, only one of which was made by Matthews. Furthermore, the newspaper published a political cartoon faulting Matthews with the loss. The shortstop is seen collapsed on the field, exasperated at having fallen “asleep at the switch.” Even in his final year, Matthews was not regarded on equal footing with his fellow ballplayers, making it easier for Harvard to delay making a decision on the southern trip. As the team likely predicted, the media did not comment on the southern trip’s cancellation. While Matthews served as a helpful source for determination in many feel-good stories, newspapers still seized the opportunity to shift blame to the lone black Harvard player.
Harvard, despite its progressive leanings, did not allow Matthews to change the future of the baseball team. Sadly, his presence on the Harvard nine was only missed from a competitve standpoint; the societal impacts were quickly forgotten. In 1906, with Matthews now in law school across the Charles River at Boston University and no longer on the baseball team, an all-white Harvard team resumed its southern road trip without a hint of controversy.
While Matthews undoubtedly changed baseball in his time, it would take years for even the most progressive members of the game to substantially even the playing field for all players. It would be over 40 years before a black player donned a major league uniform, and those many decades hardly softened the racism of the game. A man the Boston Post dubbed, “the best infielder Harvard ever had” and “no doubt the greatest colored athlete of all time” never made it to the professional level, and his effects on baseball were limited by the racism of his time. Even so, by breaking the color barrier at the country’s oldest university, Matthews shoved forward a slugging push for equality. Upon launching his career in the Vermont leagues, Matthews said of professional baseball, “A negro is just as good as a white man and has just as much right to play ball… this negro question on the diamond might as well be settled now as any time. If Burlington sticks to her guns as Harvard did, men of my race will soon be playing in the big leagues.” As baseball continues to struggle with diversity at its amateur levels, Matthews’ story is one deserving of modern attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a flurry of trades and other roster moves over Labor Day weekend, the Miami Dolphins found themselves under widespread scrutiny. Despite the fervent denials of head coach Brian Flores, many media outlets and fans have accused the Dolphins of tanking their 2019 season. Days after the trades of household names left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills, the internet was abound with rumors and accusations of the Dolphins intending to lose this season in order to improve its future position. It would be hard to deny that the front office has the future in mind, as it acquired multiple future draft picks in these trades and gave up players that would likely help the team win this season. Whether the “Fish Tank” theory is correct or not, there is one man on the Dolphins roster that will undoubtedly not be playing to lose: new starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Before the Dolphin’s first regular season matchup against rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens, Fitzpatrick was named the team’s starting quarterback. Fitzpatrick ‘05 has had a long and tried career in the NFL. The 36-year-old journeyman quarterback finds himself preparing to start a game for his eighth team in a roller coaster of a 15-year career. In his many seasons of service, Fitzpatrick has found himself on a number of struggling teams. He has never appeared in a playoff game despite playing in 141 career contests. In 2015, after setting career highs in wins, passing yards, and passing touchdowns, his 10-6 New York Jets missed the playoffs by a tiebreaker to the Pittsburgh Steelers. This coming season, the Dolphins offer little hope that the aging quarterback will finally find his way to the promised land.
Due to Miami’s current state and future plans, many currently see Fitzpatrick as a placeholder for newly acquired second-year quarterback Josh Rosen. The 22-year-old struggled in his first season for the Arizona Cardinals, and it is widely expected that Fitzpatrick was brought in to give Rosen direction and time to develop as a more accurate passer. His abysmal rookie completion rate of 55.4 percent is lower than any mark that Fitzpatrick has posted in his entire career.
With the seemingly ageless Tom Brady still playing for the division rival New England Patriots, the Dolphins are hardly alone in thinking about their quarterback of the future. While it is unlikely that they consider Fitzpatrick that answer, the Harvard product has recently shown that he still has the ability to excel in the league.
Last season, in a run dubbed “Fitzmagic,” the 2004 Ivy League Player of the Year started the season on as high of a note as possible. With Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ starting quarterback Jameis Winston suspended for the first four contests, Fitzpatrick was enlisted to step in. Despite his penchant for running, the first Harvard quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards started to sling the ball in a historic stretch that paced the NFL. Over the first three games of the season, Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards in each contest, totalling a mind-boggling 1,230 yards and a whopping 11 touchdowns. Following a poor showing in week four and a bye in week five, however, Fitzpatrick was quickly replaced with the Buccaneer’s current franchise quarterback, Jameis Winston.
Even though his magical ride occurred nearly an entire calendar year ago, Fitzpatrick still showed throughout the entire season that he deserved to be under center. He played in four more games over the course of the season, totalling a respectable 2,366 yards and 17 touchdowns with 11 interceptions for a rate that would have shattered his previous career-highs in yards and touchdowns. Even at the age of 35, the gunslinger posted career highs in completion percentage, touchdown percentage, yards per attempt, and yards per completion.
Analysts have been quick to point out that the Dolphins are focused on the future, writing off Fitzpatrick before the season has even started. He is not without his own accuracy issues: Fitzpatrick has thrown at least 8 interceptions in every season except for 2016 in which he has started at least one game, reaching the double digits in picks in eight of 15 campaigns. However, his penchant for interceptions has always been a concern, and his age seems to stay out of the way. Fitzpatrick’s best season occurred at the age of 33, and last year he showed that age has not taken its tear.
Even Fitzpatrick’s legs have not slowed down, as the quarterback totalled 4.2 yards per carry and scrambled for two touchdowns last season. This preseason, Fitzpatrick excited the internet by trucking through a defender on the Buccaneers, one of his many former teams, to gain a first down. Briefly, the internet stirred of Fitzmagic hopes. Even if the Dolphins season proves to be as disastrous as expected, the former Harvard quarterback will surely hope to create some more magic for his team.
