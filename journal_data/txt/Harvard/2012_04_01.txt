After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard Management Company has chosen not to reinvest in funds managed by HEI Hotels & Resorts, according to an email sent by HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo to University President Drew G. Faust.
Harvard announced in December that it would review HEI’s business practices after drawing criticism from labor activists and unions for investing in the company, a hotel chain which has come under fire for repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations. Harvard’s initial announcement that it would reconsider its investment in HEI was met with disappointment from many activists who felt that the University should promptly take a firm stance against HEI.
Mendillo’s email stated that the decision not to reinvest was rooted in “factors related to the HMC portfolio and its strategy and needs” rather than issues related to HEI’s labor practices. HMC is responsible for managing the University’s endowment.
Assistant Vice President of Communications John D. Longbrake wrote in an email that a student inquired about the progress of the review of HEI during Faust’s office hours. Faust sent an email to Mendillo after the conversation to request an update, which prompted Mendillo’s response that HMC had decided not to reinvest.
The University declined to comment beyond Mendillo’s email.
Within the last year, Princeton, Yale  Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Vanderbilt, and Swarthmore have all said that they would not reinvest in the company. Following Princeton’s announcement in February, students from both Harvard and Princeton called for Harvard to follow suit.
Devi K. Lockwood ’14, the SLAM member who asked Faust about HEI during her office hours, said she told Faust that she was uncomfortable with Harvard’s relationship with HEI.
“I came out as strong as I could and told President Faust that as a Harvard student, I was really ashamed that Harvard was making its profit at the expense of workers,” Lockwood said.
She said that she hopes that Harvard will continue making socially responsible investment decisions.
Lockwood said she thought the decision was a result of all of the student pressure to not reinvest in HEI.
“I think that Harvard is afraid of backlash,” Lockwood said. “We’re really vain, and we’re really concerned with how the world sees us... If students speak loud enough about an issue, it will be changed, because Harvard doesn’t want potential future donors being ashamed of giving money to the University.”
Harvard’s investment in HEI has been a major focus of Occupy Harvard and the Student Labor Action Movement’s platforms.
“It has been a concerted campaign by students on all of these campuses to get their administrations to not reinvest in HEI,” said Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents Harvard’s dining hall workers.
Lang said that he thought that the news came at a good time because workers at HEI-owned Le Meridien hotel in Cambridge are currently demanding the right to unionize.
“I think it’s a very positive development, and Harvard is doing the right thing,” Lang said. “HEI has a proven track record when it comes to not following the law and worker’s rights.”
Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, said that his union welcomed the decision and that it was “the right thing to do.”
“I think the students deserve the credit for raising the issue and standing by the issue,” Langley said.
Langley said that he thinks that HMC continues to be opaque in making investment decisions.
“There’s more work to be done,” Langley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 2, 2012, at 4:21 a.m.
At Saturday night’s eighth annual Female Orgasm Seminar, guests ate cupcakes with vagina- and penis-shaped chocolates on top while learning about female sexuality from sexologist Logan Levkoff.
Students lined up an hour in advance to get a seat in the packed Science Center lecture hall for the event, sponsored by the Radcliffe Union of Students. As guests filed into the room, board members of Sexual Health Education & Advocacy throughout Harvard College wandered around the lecture hall wearing a vulva costume.
At Saturday’s event, which capped off Harvard’s first-ever Sex Week, Levkoff spoke about the issues that adults face because they are not educated about their sexuality or are chastised as children for being curious.
“If we have problems with adult sexuality, our young ones don’t stand a chance,” Levkoff said. “We are living in a world of sexual insanity.”
She added that women in particular do not learn about their vaginas.
“It’s like the Snuffleupagus of anatomy,” she said, referring to the vagina. “From a young age girls are taught that these parts don’t even exist.”
She compared this relative ignorance and embarrassment to the culture that encourages boys to grow up talking about their penises with pride. According to Levkoff, girls are taught from early on that someone else controls their sexual pleasure, so it is important for women to learn that they can benefit from self-exploration.
“Orgasms are about our entire body,” she said. “Sexual arousal is as much mental as it is physical.”
During her presentation, Levkoff used statistics to dispel a number of common myths about female orgasms. For example, she explained that 70 percent of women do not have orgasms from vaginal intercourse alone.
She also listed of some of the benefits of orgasms, such as releasing stress and relieving menstrual cramps.
“An orgasm is a release of sexual tensions. Pleasure is a part of our sexual health,” she said.
The event concluded with an anonymous question and answer session.
One audience member asked, “I am a guy, so how do I know when girls I hook up with have an orgasm?”
Levkoff replied that the most sure-fire way to know is to ask the woman.
Audience members said they appreciated the event’s emphasis on open communication about sexuality.
“We are quiet in a way that is problematic. Dr. Levkoff did a great job in opening the conversation,” said Leonie A. Oostrom ’15.
At the end of the lecture, RUS members raffled off sex toys and presented the women’s rugby team with a vagina cake for having the most team members in attendance. They also led the enormous audience in singing “Happy Birthday” to Levkoff, who received overwhelming applause and laughter throughout the event.
“Sex Week in general is awesome,” said Roberto A. Perez ’15, “There isn’t this tension, it’s like ‘Just talk about it, guys.’ It’s nice to see a dialogue.”

UPDATED: April 2, 2012, at 3:47 a.m.
Contrary to traditional interpretations prevalent in Christian conservative America, the Bible does not oppose same-sex relationships, Matthew R. Vines ’12 argued in a screening of his video presentation “The Bible and Homosexuality” on Saturday.
Vines originally delivered his talk at College Hill United Methodist Church in his hometown of Wichita, Kan., one month ago, and he presented his findings on the Huffington Post last week.
But Saturday’s event brought Vines’ findings back to Harvard after a two-year leave of absence to examine theological texts and develop a new interpretation on the Bible’s relationship to homosexuality.
Saturday’s film screening was organized by members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, though the group itself did not co-sponsor the event.
In his presentation, Vines examined the six passages in the Bible that refer to same-sex behavior. From Leviticus—“thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is an abomination”—to Romans, Vines presented interpretations of the Bible that challenge traditional views.
For example, in addressing Leviticus, Vines pointed out that modern Christianity does not follow many of the ancient rules set forth in the Bible, even though many are tied to the word ‘abomination.’
“The most culturally distinctive aspects of the Old Law were the Israelites’ complex dietary code for keeping kosher and the practice of male circumcision, but after the Council of Jerusalem’s ruling, even those central parts of Israelite identity and culture no longer applied to Christians,” said Vines in his talk.
Another argument deals with questionable translations. Words found in older texts that translate to “effeminate” and “abusers of themselves with mankind” were changed to “homosexuals” in the mid 20th century, said Vines.
Saturday’s presentation, the culmination of two years of academic study, allowed Vines to share his findings with his Harvard community.
Chelsea S. Link ’12 said she appreciated hearing a scholastic approach to the controversial topic.
“I was expecting this to be another case of people twisting the words of the Bible,” said Link. “I’m not an expert on theology, but it was much different from the arguments I usually hear. It was really rigorous and very academic. I was impressed and convinced.”
Janie M. Tankard ’12, a planner for Saturday’s screening and an inactive Crimson news editor, added that she saw the talk as filling an important gap in the debate.
“Within conservative, evangelical Christianity there isn’t really a resource like Matthew’s that comes at this issue from this framework,” she said.
Vines hopes his talk will spark a dialogue with Christians who oppose gay rights by providing people with stronger Biblical arguments.
“If the average supporter of equality could make thoughtful, sensitive arguments about Leviticus 18 and Romans 1 rather than simply dismiss the Bible altogether, we would see a tremendous shift in the dialogue about marriage equality and other LGBT issues, ” Vines wrote in an email.
Kelly L. McPherson ’12, a planner for the event, said she sees the film as adding to the conversation, though she does not think views will change overnight.
“It strikes at the core of closely held beliefs on both sides,” she said. “I don’t think this event has changed everyone’s minds, but it is important to engage in respectful conversation. I think my views are very much in process. They are being influenced, and I am trying to work them through.”

One World, a charity concert benefiting victims of famine in the Horn of Africa and of floods in Pakistan, was held in Memorial Church on Friday night.
The two-hour event included performances by a capella groups—including the Din & Tonics, the Krokodiloes, the Opportunes, and the Callbacks—South Asian music by members of Sangeet, and a spoken word performance by Teake ’12.
Organizers said that the entirety of the proceeds from the event will be divided evenly between Harvard for Pakistan and Harvard for the Horn. The concert, which drew over 100 students, raised $500 for the two causes, according to Laila Kasuri ’13, an organizer of the event who is also a Crimson designer.
In his closing remarks, Peter D. Davis ’12, the master of ceremonies, explained that while at Harvard he has begun to interpret the word responsibility more literally as the human ability to respond.
Davis added that he hopes that the audience members “take seriously [their] ability to respond and not let these causes that seem to come and go, go away.”
In the summer of 2010 Pakistan was hit with heavy rains that caused massive flooding, resulting in thousands of casualties and displacing millions. In the summer of 2011, Pakistan again faced the worst floods in its history.
Harvard for Pakistan works to raise funds to build primary schools in flood-affected areas. According to Senan Ebrahim ’12, a director of Harvard for Pakistan, the group’s share of proceeds will go to The Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on improving education in Pakistan.
“Along with raising funds our goal is to increase awareness. People still don’t know about the floods,” Ebrahim said. “Without action it could be a loss of a future for an entire Pakistani generation.”
In the Horn of Africa, one of the most severe droughts in decades last summer caused a famine that affected millions. Although the United Nations declared the famine officially over in February, it maintained that the crisis was not over. According to event organizers, Harvard for the Horn will send funds to affected areas.
Event attendees said that although the cultural performances drew them to the event, they were glad to be made aware of these issues.
“It’s a really good cause. It was awesome that they combined so many clubs and acts,” May Yang ’15 said.

Inspired by the Occupy movement and the upcoming United Nations Rio+20 Earth Summit, Economy Futures—a group of environmentally-minded Harvard students—held a weekend-long conference on “The Transition to a New Economy,” bringing together 140 activists to discuss a transition to an economic philosophy that moves away from unsustainable economic practices.
The conference featured workshops in four areas—finance and business, poverty and inequality, environment, and governance and politics.
“[America is one of] the largest corporate run capitalist systems, [but] we have a chance to implement and set the foundation for changes that may prove irreversible,” said Gar Alperovitz, a conference speaker and a founding fellow of the Harvard Institute of Politics. “This is a very powerful period in history.”
In order to implement these changes, Alperovitz said, policy makers must redefine the metric by which government measures successful environmental sustainability.
The emphasis, he continued, should not be based on growth but rather on the happiness and well-being of the populace.
Richard Heinberg, a senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute who spoke at the event, stressed a similar sentiment by comparing the national economy to the life of a rodent.
“What would happen if [a newborn] hamster continued to double its body weight every week for one whole year?” he asked. “It would be a nine-billion-ton hamster—that’s the kind of absurdity that arises from unending compound growth.”
Economy Futures founder Rina A. Kuusipalo ’14 stressed the importance of conceptualizing long-term solutions to confront problems in current economic policy.
“It is an ambitious vision to say that you can solve these large issues,” she said. “We have to start imagining in macro terms and create viable alternatives.”

When all the serves were completed, volleys finished, and shots hit on the money, “number 11” was in the books for the Harvard men’s tennis team. On Friday afternoon, the Crimson won its 11th straight match, defeating Binghamton (7-11), 7-0, at the Murr Center.
This victory marked Harvard’s (15-1) fourth sweep of an opponent in the spring season, and its second in 7-0 fashion.
The Crimson took two out of three matches in doubles play, winning on the No. 2 and 3 courts while suffering its only loss of the day in the No. 1 spot. Senior Jonathan Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz handily beat their competition, 8-2, and was backed up by junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen’s 9-8 win. Co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster were defeated by their Bearcat counterparts, 9-7.
Singles were even stronger for Harvard. The team was victorious in all six of its matches and went to three sets in only one of the match-ups.
Freshman Henry Steer won his match, 6-2, 6-4, while classmate Alex Steinroeder took care of his opponent, 6-4, 6-2. Pearlman, coming off of his doubles victory, had no problem in the No. 1 position and finished his sets, 6-2, 7-5. Denis Nguyen, also playing only minutes after his last match, quickly wrapped up his second appearance of the day, 6-3, 6-1. Schultz continued his unbeaten spring season when he won 7-5, 6-0, and freshman Shaun Chaudhuri concluded the day’s work for the Crimson when he finished up his match 6-4, 1-6, 6-1.
Harvard is set to take on St. John’s on Sunday afternoon in its last match before the Ivy season begins.

After last summer's visit of English football powerhouse Manchester United, Harvard will once again be graced by the presence of an esteemed member of the English premiership, this time by Liverpool Football Club. Liverpool Football Club will travel to North America this summer for a pre-season tour, which will feature a match against Italian side AS Roma in Boston at Fenway Park for the 100-year celebration of the baseball park's existence.
The club, founded in 1892, is one of the most decorated football sides in British and European history. In its 110-year history, Liverpool has won 18 League titles, the second most in English football, as well as seven FA Cups. The Reds have also won more European titles than any other English side, hauling in five Champions League titles.
Fenway Sports Group, the parent company of the Boston Red Sox, is also the owner of Liverpool. The Merseyside team last travelled to the United States in the summer of 2004 for a North American tour that featured matches in the Greater New York area, Connecticut and Toronto.
In this year's tour, Harvard Stadium will serve as the home base of the Reds. In this summer's 12-day tour of the United States, Liverpool is expected to play not only at Fenway Park, but in other locations such as Toronto and Yankee Stadium. London rivals Chelsea FC is expected to compete in a pre-season match against Scottish premiership leaders Celtic FC at Yankee Stadium, so Yankee Stadium could be the site of a four-team round robin tournament this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Cornell’s Erin Keene stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the sixth in the second half of Friday’s doubleheader, co-captain pitcher Rachel Brown had seen her before. The two’s history went all the way back to their freshman year, when Brown got Keene out on the pitcher’s way to her second career save. Since then, the teams have continued to battle back and forth for Ivy League supremacy.
Keene stepped up to face Brown for the final time Friday under nearly the same circumstances as three years prior, except this time it was Harvard and Brown who were on top, as defending Ivy League Champs and as winners of the day’s first matchup. Which meant it was Keene’s turn to level the rivalry. The senior ripped a two-run homerun to break the 8-8 tie, lifting the Big Red (12-11, 3-1 Ivy) over the Crimson (15-8, 3-1) in the second contest of Friday’s twinbill at Niemand-Robison Field in Ithaca, N.Y.
The two Ivy heavyweights have split each regular season doubleheader since 2007, and Friday was no different, as Harvard scored six unanswered runs to win game one in extra innings, 6-2, in before Cornell squashed the Crimson’s second comeback attempt in game two, winning 10-8 thanks to Keene’s late-game performance.
CORNELL 10, HARVARD 8
After breaking through late in game one, both offenses continued producing early and often in game two. Once again, it was the Big Red who jumped out first, taking an 8-3 lead heading into the fifth inning
But Harvard rallied, getting four runners across to close the gap to 8-7 before tying the game in the top of the sixth on senior shortstop Jane Alexander’s RBI double. With another Crimson comeback potentially in the making, Harvard coach Jenny Allard chose to send Brown, who boasts a team-low 1.67 ERA, into the game in hopes of shutting down the Big Red offense.
“She was our most effective pitcher on Friday,” Allard said. “We thought if Rachel could hold them, then we’d have an opportunity to win.”
The plan worked initially, as Brown struck out her first adversary looking. But then she gave up a double, which brought Keene to the plate.
Brown had handled Keene in game one, striking her out on all three plate appearances. But neither Harvard nor Cornell has been able to establish control over the other in recent history, and the same held true for Brown and Keene specifically. So after Brown dominated early in the day in a Crimson victory, it was Keene and the Big Red’s turn to be back on top.
On cue, Keene drove a Brown offering deep to left field and over the wall, regaining the lead for Cornell. In the top of the seventh, Harvard managed to get only one baserunner on before falling, 10-8.
Despite the outcome, Allard defended her decision.
“I’d make that decision again,” Allard said. “There were a couple pitches she missed on, and they hit them.”
Brown had been warming up and was ready to go in if the team took the lead. But, she said, it was a spur of the moment decision to put her in during a tied game. After pitching eight innings earlier in the day though, Brown wasn’t nearly as effective this time around.
“I think I was a little tired after pitching the first game, which was emotionally draining,” Brown said. “I let down a little bit.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 2 (8 inn.)
The first five innings of game one presented a pitcher’s duel. Brown returned to form after a shaky outing Tuesday, surrendering only one hit and no runs in the first five frames. The Crimson offense generated baserunners but no runs thanks to seven stranded runners in five innings.
The Big Red broke the scoreless tie in the bottom of the sixth with a Linda Laeufer homer that gave Cornell a 2-0 lead.
But then Harvard’s offense finally broke through. In the top of the seventh with two runners on, sophomore Kasey Lange doubled to left center, bringing both runners home and tying the game. In the bottom of the seventh, Brown surrendered a double but nothing more, sending the game into extra innings.
“We had been battling and had runners on early in the game; we just weren’t coming up with timely hits,” Allard said. “We knew we would get to the point where we would score. It was just unfortunate that it didn’t come until the seventh inning.”
With two runners on again in the top of the eighth, freshman Katherine Appelbe gave the Crimson its first lead of the game on a one-run single. In the next at-bat, Alexander put the game out of reach with a three-run home run that extended the lead to 6-2.
Brown took care of business in the bottom of the eighth to seal the victory. In her complete-game win, the senior fanned 13 batters.

The Reese’s slogan is “perfect,” and though Crimson men’s basketball co-captain Keith Wright was not quite so in the Reese’s Division I College All-Star Game Friday night, the big man was able to register a solid seven points and six rebounds in 19 minutes of action.
Wright’s East squad topped the West, 103-99, in the contest, which was held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, La. on the eve of the Final Four. Both squads consisted of some of the nation’s best seniors looking to make their mark in front of NBA scouts.
The East squad was led by the reigning Big East Player of the Year, Marquette’s Jae Crowder. Crowder led all scorers with 25 points, including 18 in the second half, and won the “Reese’s Perfect Player” MVP award. Reigning MAAC Player of the Year Scott Machado led the team with eight assists.
Also on Wright’s squad were Georgetown’s Henry Sims, Wichita State’s Garrett Stutz, and Temple’s Juan Fernandez. Ricardo Ratliffe of Missouri led the West with 21 points in a losing effort.
Playing in front of 11,364 fans at the Superdome, Wright shot 3-for-5 from the field and also had an assist, a turnover, and a steal while picking up two fouls.
The senior, who won Ivy Player of the Year as a junior in 2011-12, continues to try to prove himself capable of playing basketball at a professional level.
After showcasing his talents at the All-Star game this weekend, Wright will look to next make his mark in his home state of Virginia, where he will compete in the Portsmouth Invitational—an event in which Jeremy Lin ’10 once participated—against other NBA hopefuls from April 11-14.

All of a sudden, Linsanity has come to a halt. And this time it wasn’t the result of a bad shooting night for Jeremy Lin ’10 or any opponent’s strong defensive performance. Instead, it was his meniscus.
On Saturday afternoon, the New York Knicks announced that Lin has a small, chronic meniscus tear, an injury that will require surgery and a six-week healing process.
“I can’t really do much, can’t really cut or jump,” Lin said. “So it’s pretty clear that I won’t be able to help the team unless I get this fixed right now. It’s disappointing for me. It’s hard to watch the games. And I think I want to be out there, obviously, more than anything, to help the team.”
That length of time will, unfortunately for the Knicks, span the remainder of regular season. The Harvard alum’s injury is one of many for the ballclub right now, as fellow-starter Amar’e Stoudemire is on the disabled list for the foreseeable future with a bulging disk in his back. Add Baron Davis’s continual injuries to the mix, and you’ve got quite the depleted Knicks team.
“It is a big blow,” Knicks coach Mike Woodson said shortly before his team’s Saturday evening game. “He was starting to come as a player...We got to go on.”
Lin, since his Feb. 4 breakout against the New Jersey Nets, has a +128 plus/minus, the second highest on the team behind center Tyson Chandler’s +134. This stat puts into numbers the emotional lift that he has given his Knicks since that fateful Nets game.
“It [stinks] not being able to be out there with the team,” Lin said. “And you know, it is what it is and so hopefully I can come back as soon as I can and help everybody.”
But unless the Knicks can maintain the momentum that Lin has given them thus far, they may not even qualify for the postseason. With 14 games left in the season and the team clinging to only a game and a half lead over the Milwaukee Bucks for the eighth and final spot in the Eastern conference playoffs, postseason play is not guaranteed for this organization by any means.
So, for now, the puns, the drives to the basket, and the handshakes, will have to be put on hold. All Lin can do is hope that this linjury doesn’t put an end to his team’s play like it has to his.

If you think that living outside of the Yard as a freshman isn't worth the hassle, then you should take a look at the dorm room of Colton T. Gyulay '15 and Sudheer R. Poluru '15. Gyulay and Poluru's abode is a spacious Pennypacker double that includes a common room, bathroom, and bedroom which makes the walk from the Yard well worth the time.
"I would take the trade-off any day of the week. I don't mind walking an extra few minutes for this room, because at the end of the day I can just sit down in my bathtub and take a bubble bath if I so please." Poluru said.
The two have the good fortune of having a bathroom that is bigger than many people's double bedrooms, in addition to the privilege of not having to share with other residents in their hall. Previously equipped to be handicapped accessible, the bathroom is one of the highlights of the room.
In fact, the bathroom is well known throughout the dorm. "People walk through our room all the time because they hear we have a nice bathroom," Poluru said. "Multiple girls have requested to use our bathroom."
Aside from their palatial water closet, the boys have made the room reflect their personalities with small touches.
"We had a couple interior designers come through, take a look at the layout, and get a feel for the space," Gyulay said.
"Yeah—our mothers," added Poluru.
Their personalities shine through in their collection of posters, which includes an "open arms" poster to welcome people into the room, as well as an "Ocean's Thirteen" poster to remind them to "dress classy."
Other than its dimensions and features, Gyulay and Poluru's room also serves as a social center. Located on the first floor, near the entrance of Pennypacker, and directly above the WHRB headquarters, Poluru and Gyulay noted that one of the best parts about their room is that people are always stopping by.
Asked about his décor advice, Gyulay said, "I think it's nice to have a place that you can hang out that's not a desk or your bed. Like a couch or something."
"Or a bathtub," Poluru quipped.

Panera Bread has set a date for their grand opening: Friday, April 13. With new table service on both floors, Harvard students can snack on Panera's signature soups and breads without moving from the second floor armchairs overlooking Widener.
Over the next two weeks, Panera will complete staff training sessions and put the finishing touches on their decor. The space features fireplaces upstairs and downstairs to create a cozy atmosphere for students to eat, work, or socialize.
The restaurant occupies the same space on Mass. Ave. that housed Bob Slate Stationary.
Keep an eye out for a virtual tour from The Crimson the week before the restaurant opens.
