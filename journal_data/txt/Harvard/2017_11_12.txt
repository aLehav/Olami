After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let us not mince words. Yo Gotti’s “Rake It Up”—despite seemingly being a paean to lazily refusing to pick up your money in a strip club—is a representation of the American dream. Or perhaps, as Gotti implores us to think, the two are not mutually exclusive.
The high intellectual thought, the unencumbered attention to detail, lovingly wrenched from Gotti’s artistic soul and poured into the composition of the song’s visual accompaniment, is nothing short of true inspiration for every ambitious American artist. The video opens innocuously enough—on an average American street, with average identical American homes, average American white fences, average American front lawns, and slightly oversized (read: average) American rakes. However, Gotti is reformulating the average through the careful composition of his scene. Lining the meticulously manicured lawns and modest front lawn trees are hundred-dollar bills—strewn haphazardly, and as the video develops, raked ineffectively.
What is the message here? What is the weight of Gotti’s artistic vision? What Gotti is doing here is subtly ingenious: Juxtaposing images of America—specifically imagery of the American dream—with money that grows on trees and, in a reformulation of that ancient idiom, money that grows from grass, produces a highly specific vision of the way that capital is accumulated in America. First, in Gotti’s formulation, one must have access to the outcome of the American dream (here, represented by homeownership—lawns, fences, homes); second, and only after the achievement of the American dream, one may access easy American capital (the subtle motif of those Benjamins).
Note how free capital is consistently connected to the setting of the home throughout “Rake It Up.” Hundreds line Gotti’s front lawn. They litter what is ostensibly his back yard, float on top of his swimming pool, and hang from his trees. Benjamin Franklin’s smiling face even provides slippery carpeting for Gotti’s throne room and the red, windowless, oddly well-lit rake-room that Gotti seems to have somewhere in his house.
Even more evocatively, especially because the video seems to feature universally black actors, the undisputed connection that Gotti makes between the added accumulation of free capital and homeownership must be situated within its American racial context—a context in which blacks currently have lower homeownership rates than average due to a variety of factors (among them, historical discrimination). Like all great art, Gotti’s “Rake It Up” is implicitly political.
Gotti is implicitly arguing, deep within the fabric of his video, that black Americans are isolated from the accumulation of easy American capital because African-Americans, as a whole, have not been welcomed into the American tradition of homeownership. How does one rectify the financial discrepancies between the black community and America as a whole, Gotti implicitly muses? By acquiring property, as Gotti has. Although, as I am sure Gotti is aware, that is a bit like the ancient and still puzzling problem of the chicken and the egg.
Or perhaps Gotti’s message is even more subtle than I’ve made it out to be. First, it should be noted that Gotti does not indicate that easy capital can be acquired through any mere representation of the American dream. Scenes featuring cars and alcohol—notably untied to Gotti’s specific sense of homeownership—do not prominently feature representations of easy capital. However, perhaps even more subtly, Gotti seems to be implicitly refuting American consumerist culture.
Why does Gotti sound so nonplussed when rapping about his wealth? Why is his rake room red? Why does he refuse to partake in the collection of easy capital? Why does Nicki Minaj, featured on the track, mention China more times than our president on the campaign trail after a quick chat with Paul Manafort? Why does Gotti take on the role of “flag girl”—replacing the titular flags with stacks of cash?
In Gotti’s art, each question is an answer. Gotti senses the inherent philosophical emptiness of mindless capital accumulation—and while he diagnoses part of the root cause of unequal distributions of capital by race in America (disparities in homeownership rates), he acutely understands that money does not equate to spiritual satisfaction. That is why Gotti sounds bored out of his skull in “Rake It Up”: The accumulation of easy capital gives him no philosophical fulfillment. Ignore Gotti when he claims, “Respect ya hustle, get ya money baby” and “I'm the dough boy.” It is his attempt to give an easy reading to his song for simple-minded fools to grasp. (No, not I!) Instead, focus on how bored he sounds when he says it—how morally drained he sounds. It is as if, like Taylor Swift, he is barely trying. Focus on his refusal to pick up those free Benjamins, instead grabbing a newspaper with a potentially political headline.
Thus, as Minaj talks about China, car races, Blac Chyna, places the Benjamins in a garbage bag, and enters a home with the address “1985”—suspiciously one year away from George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “Nineteen Eighty-Four”—she becomes the antonym to Gotti’s apathy towards consumerist culture. Minaj takes that free capital for herself. With that, she becomes the harbinger of the ultimate product of a consumerist culture. She walks into her ominously addressed house, as if walking into a dystopian future based on a variation of the literary past.
As Gotti stands with two stacks of cash in his hands—replacing the flags of a “flag girl” with hundreds—the pessimism of Gotti’s perspective snaps into place. Gotti, ever the sociologist, seems to say that the culture of consumerism has replaced the flag—a particularly patriotic individual may say the American flag. All we can do in the wake of this fate is, as the video comes to a close, read the newspaper and give, as Gotti does, a hearty, neighborly wave to the harbinger of our society’s demise. In a thoughtful, final touch, Minaj does not wave back. The future of capitalism, Gotti seems to say, is cruel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a botched assassination attempt by the new Taylor, the old Taylor Swift is back with a vengeance. Or are these two new Taylors? Not to be confused with “You Belong with Me”-Mean-Brunette-Regina-George Taylor Swift, or “Bad Blood”-Leather-Jumpsuit-Machete-Wielding-Combat Taylor Swift, or—God, they’re like Hydra. You cut one head off and two more show up. Like any good pop star femme fatale, Taylor has many alter egos—that’s common knowledge. But what might come as a surprise is Swift’s biological ability to procreate asexually, like a bacterium. It may look like a filmic trick, but in all seriousness, these are all separate clones.
The Taylor in “…Ready for It?” is a cloaked cyborg who spends the first minute walking down a dingy alleyway flanked by eight bodyguards, whom viewers have interpreted as stand-ins for Swift’s eight famous ex-boyfriends, a continuation of the precedent set in “Look What You Made Me Do” with eight back-up dancers. Insiders report that Swift now hires staff exclusively in increments of eight. Her team now includes sixteen bodyguards on standby and thirty-two personal chefs, each with their personal recipe for green juice. Yes—four variations for each boyfriend. Swift’s personal favorite is “Gyllenhaal No. 3,” an apple-kale blend.
Graffiti on the walls reads “I Love You in Secret,” “UR Gorgeous,” “All Eyes on Us,” and “This Is Enough.” Viewers have speculated that these are future song titles. Other viewers speculate that these are just evidence of Swift’s penchant for endearingly innocuous graffiti. Slightly out of shot, but also relevant: “My Crush on You Is, Surprisingly, Not a Publicity Stunt,” “Yes, I’m Secretly Dating a D-List White Boy,” and “I Love You as Much as I Love Social Media Rebranding.”
But subliminal messages caused less of a stir than did the video’s gratuitous sci-fi effects. Upon release, the video for “…Ready for It?” attracted heavy controversy for its overt similarities to last spring’s “Ghost in the Shell,” a Westernized remake of a Japanese anime starring Scarlett Johansson. Clad in an illuminated, skin-tight bodysuit, Swift closely resembles Johansson’s cyborg soldier character. Scarlett Johansson is not Asian; neither is Taylor Swift. Swift’s video is also peppered with Chinese letters reading “The Year of the Snake.” Some might claim appropriation, and the fact remains that Mandarin is a beautiful language that should only be reserved for sacred occasions, like Urban Outfitters graphic T-shirts and lower back tattoos reading, loosely translated, “lettuce.” Li Bai be damned! And can you really blame Swift? Who wouldn’t want to pay homage to a box office bomb responsible for whitewashing another Asian narrative?
Baby, let the games begin: Two Taylor Swifts, both arguably not Asian, duke it out from across a boundary of psychic energy. One fights atop a cyborg white horse, a vestige of Swift’s “White Horse” days, a subversion of fairy tale imagery. The other is cloaked in what appears to be a Dark Kermit allusion. Or a Taylor Swift in hiding circa three months ago costume.
Ultimately, Dark Kermit Taylor is no match for a well-timed high note belted by Cultural Appropriation Taylor. Her face skin starts disintegrating à la Voldemort in the last “Harry Potter,” and her cyborg cronies are struck by sci-fi lightning on a platform that reads “THEY’RE BURNING ALL THE WITCHES.” “They” meaning… cyborgs? media outlets? women who don’t help other women? Thank God we have a feminist icon out here calling the shots!
Cut to Cultural Appropriation Taylor on her victorious descent on an escalator. Despite her triumph, a single tear streaks down her robotically good complexion. Winning may look easy, but it’s hard out here for a witch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alex Lahey’s debut album, “I Love You Like A Brother,” is the most exciting Australian debut in the last two years. Witty and self-effacing, Lahey brings a fresh sound to a well-trod path. The video for the album’s biggest single thus far, “Every Day’s The Weekend,” demonstrates just how original she is by giving full proof that Alex Lahey is a clone.
The video opens innocently enough, as Lahey, wearing a blue jumpsuit, goes to work as a supervisor in a pickle factory. Lahey soon dozes off as a paintbrush, a severed head, and some hi-tops go by on a conveyor belt. Ostensibly massive amounts of damage occur, and Lahey gets hit with six lawsuit folders, then is fired. After this, however, things get a little suspicious. Lahey appears applying for a job as a promoter for an illegal organ donation service, but here she looks markedly different. What is the difference, you ask? She’s wearing a grey sweater and red pants. Something’s off. After Lahey’s fired for dozing off on this job, we see a third, yet equally different Lahey wearing a white shirt and an apron in a bakery while getting berated for messing up a cake. All of a sudden, she disappears. Lahey reappears at an audition where she walks in the room and realizes she’s everyone there.
There are at least four different Alex Laheys and the cavalier way in which Lahey reveals this is shocking. Alex Lahey has somehow managed to clone herself and start a jam session with her doppelgangers. On top of several questions this raises, including whether or not this counts as extreme DIY indie, the viewer is left wondering what Lahey intends to do with her clones. Will she undermine Australia’s workforce like in the video by snoozing off and committing acts of gross negligence nationwide? Or will she use her clone force to take over the world and dominate the airwaves with her sinister army? “Every Day’s the Weekend” leaves few clues as to her true goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2015, Penn upset Harvard football to disrupt a perfect season.
In 2016, the Quakers scored in the final minute to prevent a historic four-peat for the Crimson.
In 2017, the stakes were lower, but the result was the same. On a brisk afternoon at Harvard Stadium, Penn (5-4, 3-3 Ivy) froze out the Crimson offense, holding the team under double digits for the first time since 2009.
The result was a dispiriting 23-6 defeat that dashed Harvard hopes of an Ivy League championship. Combined with Yale’s 35-31 win over Princeton, the loss to the Quakers pushed the Crimson (5-4, 3-3) out of the title race.
“We just did not offensively capitalize on our opportunities,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Stating the obvious, you just need to score more points to be in the game against a really good football team like Penn.”
Down 10-3 at halftime, Harvard emerged from the locker room with energy. Completions to senior halfback Ryan Antonellis and junior wide receiver Henry Taylor advanced the Crimson into Penn territory, and Harvard soon earned a first-and-goal at the nine.
Then quarterback Joe Viviano made a mistake. The senior telegraphed a throw to junior Justice Shelton-Mosley along the sideline. Defensive back Conor O’Brien stepped forward for the pick. That play, along with a lackluster first half, led Murphy to replace Viviano with freshman quarterback Jake Smith in the third quarter.
Three plays after the interception, the Quakers were in the end zone. On first-and-goal from the 19, quarterback Will Fischer-Colbrie absorbed a hit from senior Tristan Tahmaseb but still found favorite target Justin Watson in the end zone. Penn 17, Harvard 3.
On the day, Viviano led the Crimson with 109 passing yards on 6-of-14 throwing. He added 58 rushing yards. With the senior at the helm, however, Harvard struggled on third down, converting two of 13 tries.
The Quakers seized control thanks to running back Tre Solomon. On the first play from scrimmage, the senior swept right and sprung through a hole. He raced down the Penn sideline past whooping teammates for a 77-yard score.
“That was an interesting one, to say the least,” Murphy said. “It put us behind the eight ball early, but our kids dug in…. I thought we played very solid defense the rest of the day.”
The sprint bore eerie similarity to a 79-yard jet sweep that Watson broke off at Harvard Stadium in 2015. The All-American played a major role in the Quakers’ previous wins over the Crimson, totaling 269 receiving yards and two touchdowns.
Harvard mostly shut down that threat, as Watson failed to hit 50 receiving yards for the first time in 2017. Even so, he set an Ancient Eight record with nine consecutive games with a receiving score.
The Crimson fell victim to something else—a powerful Penn running attack. The Quakers accumulated 281 yards on 40 carries, more than Harvard had conceded in any previous game. The closest comparison came in week four, when Cornell churned for 233 rushing yards in a 17-14 victory.
“A lot of plays were getting a lot of vertical push,” Solomon said. “A lot of players are just feeling more comfortable with the game plan, and we were just able to open up a lot of holes.”
The ground game was on display midway through the second quarter, when Penn added to Solomon’s early score. Starting at their own 16, the Quakers pushed into Harvard territory after sophomore Karekin Brooks cut past several tacklers on a 17-yard run.
Penn got within five yards of the end zone, but the possession stalled thanks to linebacker Chase Guillory. The senior batted down a third-down pass to force a 37-yard field goal, which gave the visitors a 10-3 lead.
On that drive, and throughout the game, the Crimson defense gave up yardage but made stops to keep the game within reach. Another example occurred in the third quarter, when the Quakers took over at the Harvard 38 after a wobbly kick by senior punter Zach Schmid.
After conceding a 16-yard rush, the Crimson held strong. Senior safety Tim Haehl broke up passes on consecutive plays, and Penn settled for another field goal and a 20-6 advantage.
Three minutes later, senior safety Tanner Lee gave Harvard some hope by forcing a fumble at the Crimson 35. Down two scores, the offense pranced onto the field. But less than a minute later, Penn was the one celebrating. On a first-down run, the Quakers poked the ball away from Booker and regained possession at their own 45.
That turnover essentially sealed the result, as Penn mounted a four-minute drive. The possession finished with a 36-yard field goal that pushed the score to 23-6, meaning a three-possession contest.
By that point, freshman quarterback Jake Smith had replaced Viviano. Murphy made the decision after Viviano failed to notch a touchdown in three quarters.
“You’ve got nothing to lose,” Murphy said. “Really, we needed a spark. When you’re playing two quarterbacks, it’s obviously symbolic that you’re not exactly happy with your offense. We’re not in a great place.”
The Quakers secondary deserved much of the credit, as defensive backs smothered wide receivers. In the first half, Viviano completed two passes for 17 yards.
The Crimson got on the board early in the second quarter thanks to an 11-play drive that took 4:51. Freshman running back Aaron Shampklin pushed Harvard into the red zone with a 15-yard rumble in which he bounced off several defenders.
The Crimson failed to capitalize, though, as Viviano scrambled for a loss on third-and-goal. Harvard settled for a 24-yard field goal and a 7-3 score.
The offense produced more points on the second drive of the third quarter, when Shelton-Mosley revived fans with a 45-yard catch deep in Penn territory. While Harvard pushed to the eight, a chop block penalty stalled the drive and led to a 32-yard kick.
Lost in the final score was the early obstinance of the Crimson defense, which forced Fischer-Colbrie to toss two picks before halftime. One occurred early in the second quarter, when junior safety Cole Thompson undercut a post route. That turnover led to a field goal.
The other interception came just before intermission. Penn had advanced to the Harvard 25. With eight seconds left, Quakers coach Ray Priore elected to run a play before trying a field goal. Fischer-Colbrie made him regret that decision, as safety Lee grabbed the pass in the end zone.
Ultimately, those turnovers proved insignificant. Crimson players, especially seniors, wanted a win over Penn to erase the bitterness of the past two seasons. Now they will have to deal with the taste of a new defeat.
“We approach every single game the same way with maximum effort [and] focus,” captain Luke Hutton said. “That’s what we're going to do this week. I have all the faith in the world that we have the leadership to do so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday’s tilt against Columbia epitomized the frustration Harvard has faced in the 2017 men’s soccer season. Unable to successfully defend set pieces and struggling to generate offense, the Crimson fell to the Lions 6-0 in New York.
Harvard (2-9-4, 1-2-2 Ivy) will have the week off before hosting Penn (3-12-1, 1-4-1) in Saturday’s season finale at Jordan Field. Although the match will have no impact on the Ancient Eight title, it will have extra significance for seven Crimson players.
Saturday will mark the last time that co-captains Justin Crichlow and Eric Gylling, along with fellow seniors Nate Devine, Nathan Goldberg, Ibukun Omotowa, Kyle Parks, and Christian Sady will don the white and red. The seven players from the graduating class of 2018 will be recognized before Saturday’s match.
The graduating seniors have had an immense impact on the Harvard men’s soccer program over the past four years, guiding the team to 32 victories over the past four seasons. Even beyond on field performance, the seniors have played a huge role, especially in their relationships with underclassmen.
“It was hard at first, being a new player,” said talented freshman midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso. “But a lot of the seniors took me in and tried to show me that I had a voice as a young player, and that I had a role to play as well.”
Offensively, senior midfielder Sady has recorded the second most points on the team this season. Sady’s go-ahead goal at Yale in the dying minutes sealed a 2-1 comeback win over the Bulldogs, arguably the team’s best performance of the season.
I haven’t really thought it about it too much honestly, it hasn’t really kicked in that this is going to be my last game,” Sady admitted. “But obviously there might be a little added emotion and excitement surrounding Saturday.”
Defensively, a stout unit anchored by mainstays Crichlow and Gylling has been crucial in the team’s successes the season. Gylling’s consistency has been especially impressive, as the Sacramento, Ca. native has started each of the team’s 15 games this season.
Behind the defense, Parks has been outstanding between the posts throughout the 2017 campaign, breaking various career-highs and keeping the Crimson in several tightly contested matches, many of which ended in double-overtime ties.
Playing in all but two matches, Parks elevated his play against nationally ranked New Hampshire and Dartmouth, conceding just one goal in each contest and recording eleven saves in each, a career high.
Although the season has been a frustrating one for the Crimson, Saturday’s opponent, Penn, bodes well for the season finishing on a positive note. Mired in a three-game losing streak, the Quakers are in the cellar of the Ivy League standings, and have registered just win road win all season.
At the root of Penn’s problems in the 2017 season has been difficulty between the posts and on defense. Goalkeepers Etan Mabourakh and Scott Forbes have conceded 31 goals on just 82 shots, with only one shutout all season.
To find success against the Quakers, Harvard will have to launch shots on goal early and often. The Crimson was only able to muster two shots in each of its past two losses against Dartmouth and Columbia. In order to capitalize on Penn’s poor goalkeeping, the team must reverse this trend and look to challenge Mabourakh or Forbes.
Recent history bodes well for Harvard, winners of two straight against Penn, including a 6-0 victory in 2015. Overall, the Crimson lead the series over the Quakers, by a 38-34-5 tally.
Despite a respectable 2-4 road mark, Harvard has yet to tally a win on home turf, recording a 0-5-4 mark in Cambridge. Thankfully for the graduating seniors and the rest of the Crimson, Saturday marks one final opportunity to take the field in search of a win.
While the 2017 campaign has not been as successful as the Crimson might have hoped, the same cannot be said of the four-year stint the graduating class has spent in Cambridge.
“This is the most impactful, life-changing group of people that I’ve ever been a part of,” Sady said. “And I’m extremely grateful for that.”
Although this season is coming to a close for Harvard men’s soccer, the future of the team is bright. Players like Belloni-Urso, sophomore forward Philip Hausen, and freshman keeper Matt Freese, hope to continue the culture that this year’s seniors helped established.
“The seniors played a major role this year,” Belloni-Urso explained. “But I feel that the juniors will step up and the rest of the team will continue to mature. We’re just trying to cherish this last week together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season opener for the Harvard men’s basketball team was marked by inconsistency and lapses in attention.
Nevertheless, Harvard’s raw talent proved to be its savior, as it edged MIT 73-64 on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. Important contributions from sophomore forwards Seth Towns and Chris Lewis were key to injecting energy into an overall sluggish performance by the Crimson (1-0).
Lewis earned his first career double-double, bringing down 10 boards to go alongside 13 points. Additionally, the frontcourt anchor for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker tallied three rejections and two steals.
The Engineers (0-1) brought the game within a two-point margin at 51-49, but a late three-pointer by sophomore guard Bryce Aiken proved to be decisive in cementing a Harvard victory. MIT was led by junior guard Bradley Jomard, who delivered 17 points while playing in all 40 minutes of game action.
DEFENSIVE GAPS
Last season, then-senior Zena Edosomwan was the headman on defense for the Crimson. His domineering presence was clearly missed by Amaker’s squad in Friday night’s game.
For an Engineers roster that featured no players weighing in above 215 pounds, the guests managed to secure nine offensive rebounds in the contest. Additionally, Harvard let up numerous easy drives to the basket, allowing 28 points in the paint for MIT.
“I thought they beat us off the bounce, which caused a lot of help and recover situations,” Amaker said. “They’re hard to guard, they’re small. There is not a lot of size so matching up with smaller teams like that can be hard to guard.”
Managing fouls will also be an overarching point of emphasis for the Crimson moving forward. Lewis, Aiken, and junior guard Corey Johnson each tallied four personals, and Harvard logged double-digit team foul marks in both halves of play. Much of the latter portions of the game became extremely choppy as both teams were deep inside the bonus. MIT went to the line 21 times in the game, shooting 61.9 percent.
“We were antsy coming out and gambled too much,” Towns said. “Sticking to our defensive principles is something that would help us. A lot of it was just adrenaline, especially in the beginning, and so I think that will clear up as the season moves on.”
ATTACKING THE INTERIOR
Last season, Towns was mostly a perimeter threat for the Crimson. In Friday’s opener, Towns demonstrated his strengths in directly attacking the rim and finishing aggressively. Of his game-high 20 points, the sophomore only took one attempt from three-point range, while getting to the line for 12 free throw attempts.
Towns also grabbed three offensive rebounds, one of which was a skillful tip-in to extend the Crimson lead to nine late in the first half.
“When Coach recruited me, he told me I was a versatile player and he could stick me offensively and defensively, anywhere the team had a gap.” Towns said. “Offensively we have a philosophy where we move the ball and play inside and out.”
Lewis also had several memorable highlights in the frontcourt, including two resounding dunks with less than six minutes left in the game. Lewis was complemented in the barracks by sophomore forward Henry Welsh, who in just nine minutes of action contributed two easy baskets and two rebounds.
That said, Harvard was playing against one of its smallest opponents this season, so it will remain to be seen whether Amaker will continue to preach this level of aggressiveness on offense.
Despite Aiken knocking down three triples in the contest, the rest of the team struggled mightily from beyond the arc. Only Towns’ three and one from sophomore guard Christian Juzang successfully found the bottom of the net, with 13 others going astray.
Most notably, Johnson and freshman guard Rio Haskett struggled greatly in their perimeter offense. The two guards went a combined 0-for-7 from three-point range and tallied just four points in the contest. Some of the struggles can certainly be attributed to nerves and antsiness, something Amaker believes will subside as the season progresses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first home double-header of the season, the Harvard women’s hockey team faced off against Ivy League opponents Brown and Yale. The Crimson came off a two-week break ready to jump further into Ivy play and looked to gain a foothold in the ECAC against two sub-.500 teams.
But the time off was not without its unfortunate developments: the team lost tri-captain and top-line center Lexie Laing to injury, and later learned she would be out for the rest of the season.
Nevertheless, Harvard (3-1-1, 3-1-1 ECAC) rallied to pick up three of four available points through the weekend.
Against Brown (1-7, 1-5), nine different Crimson players tallied points in a 6-3 triumph—but the contest was closer than the score suggests, as the Bears trimmed down a 5-0 deficit in the last eight minutes of the game. That same third-period slowness caught up to Harvard against Yale (2-4-2, 1-3-2), when the Bulldogs erased the Crimson’s 2-0 lead for a 2-2 tie that overtime could not decide.
“We obviously were looking for two wins,” tri-captain Haley Mullins said. “We never want to tie or lose to an Ivy League team, but we’re a young team.”
HARVARD 2, YALE 2
In Saturday’s afternoon matchup, the Crimson played host to Ivy rivals, the Bulldogs. Yale had opened its Ivy League play the day before and emerged with a 5-1 win over Dartmouth.
While Harvard was having a strong second period on Friday against Brown, so were the Bulldogs in their own contest—two of their goals came during the middle frame against the Big Green. Though Yale’s record was less than stellar coming into Cambridge, it still brought an explosive offense up against the Crimson.
“Yale’s not going to go away,” said head coach Katey Stone. “It’s a great matchup, and I thought their goaltender did a great job [too].”
The visitors’ opportunistic, quick-strike offense was what made Harvard pay for sitting back on a two-goal lead late in the second period.
At 16:42 of the middle frame, Yale senior forward Eden Murray controlled a faceoff in the Crimson’s zone and fed her freshman linemate, Greta Skarzynski, in the slot. Skarzynski worked past the Harvard player marking her and chopped the biscuit between Crimson sophomore netminder Beth Larcom’s pads. The play underwent a long review, but was ultimately ruled a goal, cutting Harvard’s lead in half.
Later, with just one minute to play in the game, Yale junior forward Emma Vlasic crept into the high slot and fired the puck at the goal; Larcom was screened and never had a chance. Tied 2-2, the game would go to overtime.
“We had command of a large part of the game, in many different areas,” Stone said. “We let it slip away a little bit at the end there.”
Earlier, the Crimson got out to a lead by putting on a sharp power play late in the first frame, keeping up near-continuous play to tire out Yale’s penalty killers. Just as the penalty was expiring, Harvard sophomore defender Ali Peper fed sophomore Val Turgeon right across the crease—the east-west play allowed Turgeon to find the open net for the 1-0 lead. Turgeon’s goal also played spoilsport to the Bulldogs’ impressive penalty kill, good for third in the nation before the game began.
The opportunities continued for Harvard to start the second, mostly because of the aggressive, fast play of its top two forward lines. On a rare fourth-line shift, though, senior forward Dani Krzyszczyk stole the puck from a Bulldog defender deep in Yale’s zone, peeled away to the slot, and went flat and far-side past Hofmann, putting the Crimson up 2-0.
Overtime began at a thrilling up-and-down pace, but no much in terms of scoring chances. Harvard registered no official shots on goal in the extra five minutes—the closest opportunity was a snipe from freshman forward Becca Gilmore that got the glass. The Bulldogs tested Larcom twice, but to no avail. The final score was 2-2.
“We need to have that energy until the last minute of the last period of the weekend,” tri-captain Haley Mullins said. “But we’re not worried. We know it’s early in the season.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 3
On Friday evening, the Bears opened their Ivy League season against the Crimson at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Brown has been a struggling team thus far, as it has lost by three goals or more in all but two of its contests, including Friday’s matchup.
The first period proceeded with up-and-down play. The Crimson’s discipline woes continued, as it took three penalties through the opening 20. But the Bears were unable to capitalize on those advantages, including a 5-on-3. Despite Harvard’s productive power play, which ranked fourth in the nation coming into play, the Crimson too could not find the net in their time with the man advantage. The closest attempt for the visiting team built off a 2-on-1, with Larcom making a save with the shaft of her stick amidst cheers from her bench. Both teams were scoreless after 20 minutes.
“I thought we were really slow starting,” Stone said. “We didn’t have any sort of rhythm in the first period at all.”
It took the Crimson just three and a half minutes into the second frame to find that rhythm. A scramble in front of Brown sophomore netminder Calla Isaac resulted in Harvard junior forward Bradley Fusco shoving the puck past the goal line. Fusco’s first tally of the season gave the team a 1-0 lead, and was assisted by Gilmore and sophomore Kat Hughes.
From then on, the Crimson virtually set up shop in the Bears’ blue paint, playing in the offensive zone even while on the penalty kill. Harvard’s aggressive attack eventually paid off again 11 minutes into the second. Circling around the left wall, junior Kaitlin Tse passed to Turgeon at the near corner of the left circle. Turgeon was all alone, and slotted a fast shot past Isaac, short-side, to put the Crimson up, 2-0. Harvard stayed on top to finish the period up by two.
The score did not stay that way for long.
Early in the second, two Crimson freshmen stepped up—Keely Moy swooped down the right wing all alone, dangled in the slot, and beat Isaac high glove four minutes into the frame. Less than a minute after her, Brooke Jovanovich fished the puck of out a net-mouth scramble and and tucked it away to give Harvard a 4-0 lead. T
he shots kept coming for the Crimson, and so did the goals for Jovanovich, who fired a shot past an already-down Isaac into a wide-open net five minutes later. Though the tally was reviewed for goaltender interference, the call on the ice stood. Jovanovich’s first multi-goal outing put Harvard up 5-0.
The game could conceivably have ended with that score, with Larcom picking up a well-deserved shutout. But the Bears did not sit back, matching the Crimson shot for shot, and, most importantly, capitalizing on Harvard’s mistakes.
Brown notched three quick goals in less than four minutes to bring the count to 5-3. One was off a confusion in front of the net with Crimson defender Emma Buckles partially screening Larcom, and two were on separate two-player advantages. The game saw 13 penalties altogether, some of which Stone believes were “tough calls”—particularly those late in the third that led to the Bears’ partial comeback.
“You can’t call everything,” Stone said. “[But] we exacerbated it with another penalty—then you’re back in a 5-on-3. That’s definitely an area of concern.”
To its credit, though, the Crimson was able to wrest back momentum after the setback. The final nail in the coffin for Brown was a high-glove wrister from the right circle by Mullins.
“It was great to have us come right back and score the sixth goal,” Stone said. “[Mullins] earned every bit of that tonight...she played her heart out. I was glad to see her put that cherry on the top of the cake.”
