After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A large drapery hangs from the entrance of the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, detailing the evolution of Harvard’s art museums throughout the decades. One word, printed in thick, black letters, spreads out across the center: transformation.  The word serves as a harbinger, a visible indicator of the drastic changes that have and will continue to transform the arts at Harvard.  Yet despite this push for reform—the most recent form of which is the renovation of the Fogg Art Museum—a significant amount of work goes into keeping one thing from ever changing in Harvard’s art world–the artwork itself. Beyond the glass encasements of the Sackler’s most treasured pieces and the miles of cluttered stacks that inundate Widener, Lamont, and Harvard’s many other libraries stand two centers in charge of ensuring that these objects are preserved: the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies and the Weissman Preservation Center. Although the technicians at these two Centers play a behind-the-scenes role, their use of ever-developing technologies to preserve the works of the past are integral to the creation and maintenance of Harvard’s world-renowned literary and artistic collections.DON’T GO, ROTHKOSince it’s introduction in the 1920s, art conservation at Harvard has come a long way, and it has helped damaged pieces of art extend their display shelf lifetimes. Edward Waldo Forbes (Class of 1895), who served as the second director of the Fogg from 1909 to 1944, worked laboriously to create and expand the Center for Conservation and Technical Studies—the first of its kind in the United States. He spearheaded the use of x-rays to analyze and authenticate the Fogg Museum’s expanding art collection, and he appropriately called the Fogg a “laboratory for art history.” Today, the Center for Conservation and Technical Studies has become the Straus Center for Conservation, in honor of long time benefactors Lynn and Philip A. Straus ’36. It continues to pioneer novel methods of conservation, which it then describes in its own journal. The Straus Center provides analysis and treatment for the over 150,000 objects, from all times and places, throughout Harvard’s museums and grounds. “Our primary mission is to preserve the collection,” says Henry Lie ’72, Director of the Straus Center. “We have to make sure that it doesn’t deteriorate. There are some things that will deteriorate, there are some that may never deteriorate, so there is a lot of variety there but you try to do as well as an institution can.”Currently, the Straus Center is making groundbreaking progress, using new techniques to repair five pieces from a mural cycle sent by Mark Rothko to Harvard in the 1960s. The murals, which were one of only three made, were displayed for almost a quarter of a century in the penthouse of the Holyoke Center. But overexposure to sun on this light-sensitive paint caused the mural’s color to dramatically change—the vivid crimsons turned into tepid blues. As a result, these pieces are now displayed only once every decade. Although many thought Rothko’s murals were irreparably damaged, Senior Conservation Scientist at the Straus Center Narayan Khandekar asserts that progress is currently being made on their preservation. “We are currently conducting an investigation into understanding the mechanism of the pigments and how they fade,” Khandekar says. “And we are also looking at ways of using projected light to compensate for that lost color so that the murals can one day be redisplayed [permanently].”As a state-of-the-art institution, the Straus Center’s conservation efforts have reached beyond this campus’ grounds. Along with pieces of art from Harvard’s own collection, the Straus Center has worked on preserving seventeen paintings from Piet Mondrian’s Transatlantic series, an altarpiece created by Bartholomäus Bruyn during the 15th century brought in from Germany, and the enormous wall murals that decorate the Boston Public Library by John Singer Sargeant. Lie claims that the conservation of the Sargeant murals has been one of Center’s most exciting tasks under his tenure. “It was a very big project that gave us a chance to do significant work and to present the work we were doing and the sheer size of it all to the Boston public through webcam,” Lie says. “I’d say that is one of the most interesting projects we’ve done.” ACCESS HARVARD BOOKSThough the restoration process of the Sargeant murals was made accessible to the public through video footage, the results often remain carefully protected from spectators for fear of further harm. Yet for the technicians at the Weissman Preservation Center–who preserve books, paper and photography–their efforts extend beyond physical restoration.  Stabilizing these delicate books and images to a state where they can be readily accessed and distributed throughout the Harvard community is one of the Center’s primary aims. “This is all about access; it is not about making things beautiful and hoarding them,” says Jan Merrill-Oldham, Malloy-Rabinowitz Preservation Librarian. “Its about finding ways to get this material to people. A very common scenario is for us to assess objects, to treat them, for cataloguers to improve bibliographic records so that those objects can be found by researches and then to digitize them at a very high quality so that materials are made available worldwide.”Much like a rare object on display at the Sackler, the Weissman Preservation Center is housed in a glass encasement on 90 Mt. Auburn Street, where curious commuters can observe a small group of scientists at work.But book preservation at Harvard had much humbler beginnings. The history of library conservation at Harvard University dates back to the 18th century, when Harvard’s library employed a single bookbinder. Though the Weissman Preservation Center has considerably expanded conservation efforts, it continues to operate on goals set by Charles William Eliot, Harvard’s 24th president.“The care of libraries belonging to the University is one of the chief responsibilities of the Corporation,” Eliot said in 1873. “A great collection of books, like a museum of natural history or archaeology, is not only to be made useful to present generations, it is also to be transmitted safely to future generations.”Today, hunched over their desks on the top floor of the Center, over 20 technicians painstakingly scrutinize objects from Harvard University Libraries. On any given day, these conservators treat century-old letters by John Keats, various posters from the 1920s Ballet Russe, Egyptian images from the 19th century, and some of the first daguerreotypes ever made of the moon in 1851–often only a few inches from their faces. Technicians at the Weissman Preservation Center do not simply attempt to reverse the effects of time by both scientifically and artistically restoring objects to their original states. Unlike with paintings and sculpture, the nature of the print medium allows technicians to consider to a greater extent the history of both the material’s production and use. Merrill-Oldham asserts that every technician is in constant consultation with curators to ensure the history of these rare objects –as long as no further deterioration is caused–is preserved. “We’ve had posters that were torn down from buildings during the Boxer Rebellion,” Merrill-Oldham says. “The backs of these things are plaster. Plaster is an alkaline so it’s not going to deteriorate the object. You’re not going to take it away to try and make something pretty and new. You’re not going to hide that. We could make tremendously accurate facsimiles of such objects, but why would we? The goal isn’t to pretend it’s a new thing that hasn’t been used. Just how much are we going to treat here? When it comes to the original you want them to tell the story.”The fact that all the work done on the objects is reversible is a testament to the Weissman Center’s attention to protecting the pieces’ transformation with time–whether good or bad. Book Conservation Technician Carly Weggeland, working with large sheets of Chinese etchings from the 19th century, was applying thin sheets of remoistenable tissue, which could be attached and reattached by adding water, to the damaged portions of the etching. “We want most of the repairs that we do in this lab to be reversible,” Weggeland says. “There is a great amount of damage that has been caused by previous treatments that cause really big problems for us. Turning back the clock on many repairs is part of our life.”THE MUSEUM ITSELFWhile conservators at both Centers work behind-the-scenes, the physical conditions of the space that houses the art also play a critical role in ensuring the stability of these pieces, one of the reasons that the Fogg is currently undergoing major changes.The importance of creating an effective vehicle for the display of art is not at all unique to Harvard. And when updating a museum’s look, similar issues to those faced when working to conserve a piece of art’s original integrity must be confronted. At the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston this is the balance that is currently being navigated. Acclaimed architect Renzo Piano—designer of the Center Pompidou in Paris, the Whitney Museum of Art in New York and the renovation of the Fogg Museum—recently received approval to commence expansion of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.The renovation proposal had posed a unique challenge for the Museum. Isabella Stewart Gardner, who established the Museum in 1903, stipulated that the Museum must remain in the condition it was in at the time of her death, and if any changes were made the entire collection would be given to Harvard. But last week, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts filed a Memorandum and Judgment ruling that the proposed renovation and expansion of the Museum abides by Gardener’s desire to create a “Museum for the education and enjoyment of the public forever.” “The entirety of our museum is an artwork, so we have to be careful with our crowds and accommodating our visitors. The expansion allows for preservation in that sense, in keeping the integrity of the whole of the museum space,” says Anna Lowi, Director of Marketing Communications. “The new space will allow us to promote our accessibility to a greater number of scholars and students and visitors, those are things that allow us to conserve on a holistic level.” The current renovation of the Fogg Art Museum, which led to the temporary relocation of the Straus Center to a laboratory in Somerville, will similarly enhance the Fogg Museum’s infrastructure and preserve its historic façade. Improving the quality of the facilities that exhibit Harvard’s invaluable collections will also help to better preserve the works themselves.“Preservation, collections care, and conservation will be immeasurably improved by the renovation of the 32 Quincy Street building,” says Associate Conservator of Objects and Sculpture Angela Chang in an email. “State-of-the-art climate control and art storage will positively impact every object in our collection.” ANTIQUITY FOR THE FUTUREAlthough Harvard has always deeply cared for its collections, Merrill-Oldham says that within the last decade, the University has made many essential changes towards improving the quality of book preservation. “Harvard has taken up the mantle of its responsibility to these collections. Not that they weren’t cared for over the course of all those decades and centuries that went before,” says Merrill-Oldham, “but we did turn a corner in terms of really organizing to get work done, setting our priorities, choosing from among these materials, and putting together a staff that has exactly the kinds of skills that the Harvard collections require. There is a big difference between serendipity and planned work when you talk about broad impact.”The University’s commitment to conservation has far-reaching ramifications. The preservation efforts of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies and the Weissman Preservation Center are helping to shape the future of academia.“It is world history. It’s all that there is. It’s the tangible evidence of the past,” says Merill-Oldham of the material she preserves. “So yes, it’s important to you, it’s important to me, and it’s important to those who have access to the Harvard collection.”“But it’s also of worldwide importance,” she continues. “It tells the world story and not just for our generation but for generations to come. And it’s in that spirit that we need to treat that material. We need to do things in a way to ensure that in another three hundred years, or another six hundred years from now, someone can continue to consult this object.”Lie reiterates this sentiment, extending the impact of conservation to world social culture as a whole.“We have a national and a world culture that needs to be defined and honored and enjoyed by people,” says Lie. “By conserving we are dealing with our culture’s patrimony and that of other nations in an intelligent way because, ultimately, that is really what defines us as a civilization.”

Any transition from the television screen to the silver screen will be subject to the usual scrutiny: how does a movie studio condense a long-running TV show into a two-hour film that does the original series justice? For the live-action films of “Dragonball Z” and “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” however, casting decisions have provoked another, more sensitive issue. In company with well-known comic artists Gene Yang and Derek Kirk Kim, and many other fans and professionals worldwide, one writer at theasianeconomist.com addresses the casting of Caucasian actors in Asian roles by raising the question: “How can an Asian anime protagonist be played by a white man?”The recent revival of the Asian American Association Players (AAA Players) at Harvard seems to confront the issue of whether actors are confined to their ethnic origins or whether characters are defined by their physical traits. The original Players, which was created under the umbrella of AAA in 1994, has served as a forum for those underrepresented in theater, including Asian American students. The AAA Players enjoyed initial success: their productions of David Henry Hwang’s “F.O.B.,” Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman,” and ABBA’s rock musical “Chess” attracted large crowds and received praise for their uncustomary casting decisions and unconventional portrayals of these well-known works.A decade and a half after the creation of the original Players, whose activity on campus has been spotty over the years, Jason J. Wong ’10 has acted as the impetus behind its revival. Wong, who emphasizes the importance of diversity in productions--both ethnically and in terms of theater background--recreated the Players in part because of his experiences with Common Casting. The AAA Players poses itself as an alternative to this traditional option­­, which Wong believes could be more welcoming to minority students.“We have three major goals,” Wong says. “One, expand the boundaries of the theatrical arts through new interpretations of conventional plays. Two, increase diversity in the theatrical arts, and three, explore what it means to have an ethnic and/or cultural identity.”MORE LIKE ‘COMPETITIVE CASTING’Wong, who graduated from the theater department of San Francisco’s School of the Arts High School, has had concerns about the lack of an Asian American presence on stage. In the fall of his freshman and sophomore years, Wong auditioned through Common Casting, a selection process implemented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC), which offers every production taking place that semester an opportunity to choose its own cast. In these two instances, Wong noticed that the demographic of the students who audition are not as diverse as the entire Harvard undergraduate population.Thus Wong hopes that the AAA Players will be able to spread Asian American culture through the theater community and encourage students of Asian descent to participate in Common Casting, particularly because there are few mainstream plays that star Asian Americans. And while he appreciates its egalitarianism, Wong believes that Common Casting could be more inviting to Asian Americans and other minorities.“Oftentimes, you find the same people appearing in the [Common Casting] plays. It almost becomes like a ‘group’ thing,” Wong says.“It may seem like there is less of a minority presence in productions which, in turn, deters students of minority backgrounds,” adds Austin Chu ’10, the co-president of AAA and a contributor to the AAA Players’ revival effort.In contrast, HRDC says that it implemented Common Casting in order to combat biased auditioning. “It’s encouraged to be as open and fair as possible,” says Elizabeth G. Shields ’10, President of HRDC. “It can be an intimidating process, but that’s the nature of the audition process.” Common Casting is known for being selective, simply because of the mass volume of students who audition for the few roles available every semester. Some students involved with the AAA Players feel, however, that Common Casting is intimidating because of the largely non-minority presence that seems to dominate HRDC productions. “I feel like the rules for Common Casting were communicating typecasting. I like how [the AAA Players] is a low-key way of getting involved,” says Helen H. Tsim ’10, a participant in the first workshop, which took place March 7.HRDC’s Campus Liaison Elizabeth J. Krane ’11, who also attended the AAA Players’ first workshop, disagrees with the claim that Common Casting typecasts. “In my opinion,” she says, “and we’ve definitely discussed it a lot—it’s a very fair process. Anyone can come audition, and anyone has an equal opportunity to be cast....[The individuals making the casting decisions] go into the show looking for the people they find the most talented. They want their cast to be the strongest possible. There is no other motive there.”As an apparent resolution to this difference in opinions, the AAA Players would act as a medium through which inexperienced actors can develop their talents without having to go through Common Casting.“FEAR NOT THE FUTURE...”At the moment, the AAA Players’ main goal is to find people who will help make the organization independent of AAA, who currently funds the burgeoning theater group. Wong has plans for 10-minute, one act plays in various venues on campus, such as the University houses, that will serve as initial springboards for bigger productions. Future goals include inviting established artists and professionals to lead acting workshops, and present educational talks, lectures and panels.While the AAA Players’ initiative to include inexperienced actors may raise questions about the stability of the organization or the caliber of its productions, Wong feels that opening theater to as many individuals as possible is hardly a detriment.“[Theater is] less about having good acting—though of course we don’t want to diminish the value of quality acting—than it is about adding diversity,” Wong says. “Having a play with those who have less experience can be an artistic statement in and of itself.”“A friend of one of my cast members [of ‘Laramie’] actually told me, ‘Theater is education disguised as entertainment,’” adds Wong. “Diversifying people is great in creating that lesson. Theater is valuable not only in the skills that it teaches, but also in forming relationships with each other.”—Reporting contributed by Crystal Huang.

Thank you God, for finally giving me an opportunity to watch a surreal comeback story that neither a Christopher Guest mockumentary nor a Joaquin Phoenix fabrication could top. Ladies and gentleman, allow me to reintroduce Michael Jackson, the King of Pop.Perhaps not to be outdone by Britney Spears’ literal circus, Michael Jackson is going to be performing a number of shows this summer at London’s O2 Arena. Already, the number of shows has been bumped from 10 to 50—all for a guy who hides from the public with masks and veils.As part of the shameless promotion of the event, Jackson was recently brought before a ton of psychotic, screaming fans to give a press conference. With his face looking slightly more human than usual, he waved, did a number of poses, and repeatedly said, “I love you, I really do,” and, “This is it. This is really it.” By “it,” he is referring to what he calls “the final curtain call”—in London at least. A press release from the O2 Arena’s website gushes about the momentous performances and says, “This really is ‘It’!” The “it” is bold and capitalized, just like Stephen King’s “It,” the psycho-clown who terrorizes children.The website makes such a ridiculous attempt at mythologizing that even Jerry McGuire might get a little embarrassed: “Three quarters of a million fans clearly feel the same way and their attention will now turn to the actual concerts, perhaps the most anticipated in history. Up there alongside Elvis Presley in Las Vegas, Michael Jackson is about to write a new chapter in entertainment folklore.”Beyond the predictable popstar hyperbole, the promotional material tries to show why literally the whole world will have some hyper-historical, folkloric obligation to paying attention. Anschutz Entertainment Group, who is responsible for this incorrigible (yet unsurprising) selling of Jackson’s comeback, is able to hide behind one thing—its bottom line. As with any business, AEG will only sell what people are willing to buy. As it turns out, all 50 of the concerts have sold out in what is being touted as “record time.” Although there seem to be hints of ticket-site scamming, it is fairly apparent that MJ super-fans are still numerous, and they somehow have enough liquid assets right now to both buy a ticket and travel to England.I almost understand where ticket buyers are coming from: I too love Michael Jackson’s music. It was some of the first music I ever got from my parents, and before he went completely nuts (or was abducted by extraterrestrials), I even liked watching his music videos on VH1’s “Pop-up Video.” I always went to see “Captain EO” when I was at Disney, and the “Free Willy” soundtrack was one of my favorites when I was six. It’s clear why I, like millions of people, enjoyed his music and even respected him as a person, but that was before the horrifying accusations, the strange and incriminating behavior, the drug abuse, the strange surgeries, his marriage to Elvis’ daughter…the list goes on. Since the first allegations emerged more than 15 years ago, the world has been a forced audience to one of the most bizarre stories of modern pop culture. Do people forget, or do they just not care? Perhaps on one hand, his fans are simple irrational fanatics who will show up no matter what. On the other hand though, it always seems that, with Michael Jackson, he is able to let just enough time pass before emerging once again. He does so when even the most fanatical supporters cannot keep him afloat, allowing public amnesia to expurgate the immediacy of his sins.After time has passed, these fans (and perhaps even you and I) are somehow able to reconcile his completely reprehensible and inhuman actions with the feel-good catchiness of “Billie Jean” or “Thriller.” They, with the rest of media and entertainment, are able to separate their knowledge of the past from the present and herald the return of the freak show like it was the Second Coming.For those who have bought tickets, I am not going to say whether it’s right or wrong because that’s not my question to answer. I will say, though, that I look forward to a day when the human memory will evolve past providing us with only the capacity of holding life-long grudges against friends who owe us money and instead allow us to remember the more gruesome details of recent history. Also, to ticketholders, I’m sure it’ll be an interesting show. If MJ’s behavior over the last 20 years in any indication, “This Is It” is likely to be an epic fail, and I’m glad we’ll have YouTube to watch it go up in flames. After Michael has made his comeback, and we are left with our obsolete memories, I look forward to 2020 and Chris Brown’s “Wife-Beater Tour.”—Staff writer Andrew F.

Harvard today may be less exciting than the National University of Mexico during the sixties, when student protests against the government raged on campus, but filmmaker and producer Guita Schyfter appreciates the peaceful university experience. “I feel absolutely happy, delighted,” she says. “Probably, it has rejuvenated me…This is the first time in many years that I can dedicate myself completely to my new project.”Schyfter is the current Fundación México/Antonio Madero Visiting Fellow at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (DRCLAS). Born to Ukrainian and Lithuanian parents in Costa Rica, Schyfter studied psychology at the National University of Mexico before taking a course in television production and directing at London’s British Broadcasting Center. “I was [in London] in the 70s, which was a great time, not only for cinema but also for the BBC and its programs,” Schyfter says. After directing a string of documentaries, Schyfter transitioned cautiously to feature-length films in the 90s. “I was very scared, very nervous, but then I realized that I loved working with actors,” Schyfter recalled.Schyfter’s films often focus on female protagonists and deal principally with questions of national identity. She enjoys exploring the feminine perspective. “I like women’s film,” she said. “It’s a different point of view.” Her characters’ cultural confusion stems from her own experiences as a Jewish woman in predominantly Catholic Latin America. Experiences at university during the tumultuous 60s grounded her interest in the female situation. “I’m a feminist, but not in the way that I belong to a group,” Schyfter says. “I never belonged to any group, but the only revolution that really had success in the 20th century was the women’s revolution.”Since 2007, however, she has returned to filming documentaries, partly due to lack of funding. “I was tired of knocking on every door and every possible institution and every possible producer,” she says. At Harvard, Schyfter is creating another documentary, though she is eschewing her typically female-driven narratives in favor of portraying a significant Mexican historical figure that illuminates relations between the US and Mexico.Schyfter is currently researching nineteenth-century intellectual Melchor Ocampo, a Mexican liberal who wrote separation of Church and State into Mexican law and attempted to establish a free-trade treaty between Mexico and the United States. Having participated in government protests with her classmates at the National University of Mexico, Schyfter certainly relates to his progressive ideals. Still, she remains true to her usual theme of exploring internal conflict in the face of culture clashes. Once hostile towards the United States, Ocampo reconsidered his views after living in the southern U.S. “What I’m researching here is how Ocampo’s point of view toward the United States changed when he went into exile and lived for two years in New Orleans and Brownsville,” she says. Despite her experience with producing documentaries on Mexican history, Schyfter welcomes assistance from Harvard’s vast network of resources. “It’s coming along well,” she says. “Who can have trouble at Harvard with all the experts, and the libraries, and the resources?” According to Schyfter, Harvard’s experts in 19th century and American history have been particularly helpful. While she works on her next project, Schyfter has had an opportunity to share her past work with the Harvard community. Yesterday, DRCLAS sponsored an event called Miradas, which featured a screening of Schyfter’s 2007 film “Laberintos de la Memoria” (“Labyrinths of Memory”) followed by a conversation with Schyfter and screenwriter Hugo Hiriart. Schyfter has been pleased with the outcome of the film series so far. “The people who were there had good questions and they seemed to enjoy the film,” she says.Schyfter has naturally drawn several distinctions between this college campus and her own. “We did not take the studies so seriously as it has been taken here,” she notes. “We had other interests and other preoccupations at that time. You know, who could study if we were going to change the world?”

Traditional American music has come a long way from being played on the porch during a hot, summer day or at the Boxcar Socials of a small Appalachian town, but is still rarely seen in an academic setting. Because the multiple musical genres encompassed under the umbrella of “American Music” generally rely heavily on improvisation and informal settings, it is easy for them to be overlooked by artistic and academic institutions, shadowed by the cohesion and organization of symphony orchestras and classical ensembles. However, in the spring of 2007, two Harvard students, in an attempt to bring to light the significance of these less-common musical genres, founded the Harvard College American Music Association (HCAMA), providing a vehicle for musicians from a variety of non-classical backgrounds to explore their unique styles and perform together. HCAMA has now also given musicians the opportunity to perform in the Queen’s Head Pub.“There was not enough focus on bluegrass,” says mandolin player and current HCAMA president Forrest E. O’Connor ’10 when asked why he and Clay D. Miller ’10 founded HCAMA. “There was very little representation here at all.” Since then, O’Connor has expanded the group to include folk, Celtic, blues, ragtime, swing, jazz and Newgrass (a musical movement that combines bluegrass, jazz and rock) music at Harvard, though the list of styles that are connected to the group could go on indefinitely. Even though Harvard already had a well-formed jazz band and various other music groups, HCAMA is able to bring together talented musicians from various arenas because of its unique focus on bluegrass music and its emphasis on mixing musical styles at informal jam sessions. These weekly jam sessions in the pub give musicians a chance to either collaborate with other musicians with similar backgrounds or to explore other American music styles that they are not as familiar with. When HCAMA was first formed, the sessions were usually held in dorm basements or common rooms, but, O’Connor says, “there was no social dynamic in basements, because the atmosphere was so mundane.” Thus, the recent move to the pub was like a breath of fresh air. It seems to also have affected the patrons of the pub as well. “People at the pub seem to love this kind of music. There’s always a look of surprise when they walk in and hear cowboy songs,” says David Gurney, former Vice President of HCAMA. “We wanted to utilize the pub because its obviously a new installment and jazz, Irish and bluegrass musicians historically have found that pubs, whether they be in New York, Dublin, or Nashville, are great social figures for music making,” says O’Connor. The sessions are broken up into four categories: electric, jazz, bluegrass, and Celtic. Although members are welcome to try musical styles that they may not be familiar with, there is no pressure for musicians to move away from the comfort of their background. In addition to the weekly jam sessions, HCAMA—with the guidance and support of the Learning from Performers program through the Office of the Arts—is dedicated to bringing guest musicians to Harvard for performances and workshops. In the two years since it was formed, the group has arranged visits from violinist and composer Mark O’Connor, banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck, mandolinist Mark Thile, and recently, the world-renowned bassist Edgar Meyer. Not only are these guests masters of their respective instruments, they are also known for their extraordinary ability to cross genres and styles in a way that HCAMA seeks to emulate. “I don’t know how many more musicians of their caliber we can find. Musicians who not only embrace all styles, but have mastered all of them,” O’Connor says. The club hopes to continue providing Harvard students the opportunity to work closely with musicians dedicated to pushing the boundaries of American music with possible future guests  such as bluegrass-country singer Alison Krauss, jazz pianist Chick Corea, jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, and electric bass player Victor Wooten. “All of these artists have had an impact on Harvard’s music community by expanding the boundaries of what constitutes American classical music,” says Thomas Lee, program manager of Learning from Performers. “It’s gratifying to note that their work is influencing a new generation of players and composers.”The enduring legacy of HCAMA will most likely center on the monthly jazz series that the group sponsors at the Queen’s Head Pub. These performances give members the opportunity to perform their music in an actual show setting. The shows usually feature a set by HCAMA member and jazz pianist Malcolm G. Campbell ’10 and his quartet in addition to one or two other jazz or bluegrass bands. On the Friday night before the concert, anyone is invited to play music with Campbell and his group, breeding an opportunity for a creative amalgamation of bluegrass and jazz music. However, the Saturday show is a formal, programmed performance. “It gives students a chance to perform and meet people who play many different styles of music,” Campbell said.  “There are student groups at Harvard dedicated to many different musical styles and cultures, but only HCAMA spotlights the range of musical genres that can be characterized as indigenous American music: blues, bluegrass, folk, ragtime and others,” Lee says. Because of the significance that these styles of music have had on American culture, it seems only natural that they would inevitably be institutionalized. It may seem difficult for an organization dedicated to such a broad and ill-defined category of music to fit into a community known for its rigorous and intense focus, but O’Connor seems to have faith in the clubs place at Harvard. “We’ve been attracting great musicians who enjoy playing many different styles,” he says. “That doesn’t mean we’re filling in a bunch of gaps at the music scene here; we’ve simply complemented the other groups that were on campus already.”

It’s tough to be an almost 13-year-old boy. Even if one’s never been, still, one can imagine. But Eugene “Genie” Smalls, the protagonist of “Huge,” James W. Fuerst’s debut novel, has more than his fair share of adolescent angst with which to deal. “Huge” uses a fairly familiar archetype as its foundation—the bildungsroman—but the storyline quickly diverges from cliché to downright bizarre. The novel, narrated from the young Genie’s perspective, struggles to maintain a balance between reliability and believability, and, in satisfying the former, sometimes compromises the latter. Genie is a precocious preteen with a high IQ and a whole host of anger issues. He was held back a year after he punched his fifth grade art teacher. He has no friends. In truth, it’s hard for him to communicate with people at all. When vandalism strikes the local retirement home, Genie’s grandmother hires him for his first paying detective case. The plot is the stuff of a children’s chapter book, but “Huge” is nothing of the sort. For one, there’s something undeniably dark at work in Genie’s family dynamic. Genie’s older sister, Neecey, torments him by giving him more-than-occasional glimpses of her naked body. Genie’s overactive imagination thinks up increasingly disturbing sexual scenarios in which his sister might be engaging. In a fit of anger and nascent sexual frustration, Genie responds in his own turn, pulling down his shorts and flashing his sister. Unfortunately, Fuerst too often resorts to explaining his own story. “Yeah, sometimes I had problems with self-control,” Genie observes as he pulls up his pants. It would seem to the reader that Fuerst elucidates this point sufficiently without the need for Genie’s own exposition. Anyway, would 12-year-old Genie, shorts still around his ankles, realistically be able to snap back into a state of such lucid observance and proceed to comment objectively on his anger issues? In addition to its over-telling, the passage points to a sort of incestuous tension that is hardly subtle. “Those big-ass balls of yours!” Neecey says, examining her younger brother’s naked body. She goes on to say, “You never know, you could have a decent little pecker when you get older.” Though there are many such disturbing scenes throughout the novel, they are often presented without any explication or means of interpretation—completely orphaned by the story at large.“Huge” is, at its heart, the story of Genie’s quest to come to terms with his reality and the world around him. One of the keywords he’s picked up after a spate of therapy is “actualization.” Genie’s vague understanding of the term revolves around communication and connection with people in his life. But first he has to get a handle on his emotions. Genie’s only friend is a stuffed frog named Thrash given to him by one of his counselors, he recalls, “to help me actualize, because I was too alone and locked up inside myself.” 	The discussion of child psychology is limited to that which Genie might be able to comprehend—not very much. However, the novel strives to provide a commentary on Genie’s psychological development over the course of his detective case. As a coming-of-age narrative, “Huge” leaves something to be desired.Genie’s relatability is sometimes compromised by uncharacteristically astute observations about his town, his acquaintances, and his family members. While these observations deliver important information, it’s hard to believe that Genie, trapped in a personal fantasy world, would be capable of giving them.Genie describes his home town as a place where, “No matter what you wanted, if it wasn’t at the mall, then you wouldn’t find it here… in a town that only existed so you could make a few purchases on your way to somewhere else.” Fuerst’s description of setting and time—suburban New Jersey in the 1980s—is vivid, funny, and authentic. The author, who spent his teenage years in the Garden State, depicts the monotony and claustrophobia of humid August days with such proficiency that it is easy to understand Genie’s excitement over the case of the retirement home graffiti, or his desire for his adventure to be complicated and far reaching. Genie is an endearing—if enigmatic—character. His issues with anger, combined with his intelligence, lead to moments of clever, believable, and funny insight. Yet “Huge” struggles to render what Mark Haddon’s novel, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time” succeeded quite well at—the portrayal of an adolescent boy’s transition from a fantasy life into reality—and his struggle to come to terms with the world around him. Though at times both humorous and evocative, Fuerst’s debut lacks the consistency and clarity to shine forth as a paragon of the bildungsroman, and thus fails to stretch the potential of this well-explored genre into exciting territory.

“So we’ve concocted a fiction, and its nothing to me, really, you know how I feel about these biddies meddling and gossiping and trying to control people’s lives—what I mean is, I’m telling people you’re the new housekeeper,” is how Frank Lloyd Wright introduces his latest mistress Olgivanna Miljanova to his estate Taliesin. He seems to expect that she will accept her new title without protest or even remark. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she does. Such is the charismatic power and authority with which T.C. Boyle imbues the enigmatic Frank Lloyd Wright in “The Women.” Boyle reveals that despite his unabashedly outrageous and callous behavior, his women throw themselves down at his feet time and again. Somehow, it’s difficult to imagine that the scion of a female Montenegrin general (one whose Turkish enemies wanted her drawn and quartered) would take the apparent demotion to “housekeeper” so sedately, but in Boyle’s world, Wright pulls this line off not once, but twice.The figure of Wright provides the punctuation mark to a narrative that is told from almost every perspective except his own. The central character’s silence creates a whirling vacuum of misplaced, fervid emotion, as every other character struggles to ensnare Wright’s interest and attention. The foremost question of the book (what is Wright really thinking?) is never answered: instead we begin with the ruminations of Sato Tadashi, a fictional apprentice of Wright’s. Tadashi’s first-person narration frames the third-person of Wright’s lovers’ perspectives, among others. His voice alternates seemingly at random between the different character’s viewpoints, somewhat haphazardly revealing pertinent details of their inner lives as they relate to the story. He also provides a relatively detached critical insight into the more volatile personalities at work; this distance offers some respite from the roiling, overheated emotion of the female protagonists. Tadashi, amusingly, does not neglect to insert his own opinions into the other narratives, in the form of slightly snide footnotes and cross-references to previously mentioned information.Boyle clearly has a gift for the compelling. As the self-appointed narrator of this tale, Tadashi illustrates the life of the so-called apprentices who sign up to learn from Wright at Taliesin (both his home and studio) and instead find themselves relegated to washing dishes, peeling potatoes, and working in the fields. Tadashi remains deeply devoted to Wright, despite his awareness of the man’s destructive narcissism. This alone would be an intriguing subject, but the true focus of the novel centers around the emotional vagaries of Wright’s women.As Virgil wrote, “varium et mutabile semper femina,” or, “Woman is ever fickle and changing.” Boyle appears to be unable to shake his fascination with Maude Miriam Noel Wright, Wright’s third great love and second wife. Maude aggrandizes herself as the erstwhile “Belle of Memphis,” and by the time she meets Wright, her self-obsession has collapsed into pure solipsism, not without the help of a casual morphine addiction. “Yes, she’d hidden her kit from Frank as much as possible and from Leora too, not that she was ashamed or in danger of becoming a morphinomane or anything of that nature, but because her medicines were a private affair and no one else’s…” Boyle masterfully conveys the relentless paranoia of this deranged woman. Her uncontrollable fits of rage lead her to attack Wright like a force of nature—at one point she even demolishes the interior of his house with an axe.Maude’s corrosive fury runs through the book, holding an irresistible sway over the reader, and Boyle himself, apparently. When the narrative turns to other characters, the memory of Maude’s madness and spiritual degradation colors the rest of the book. Despite its masterful evocation of character and tone, “The Women” does not gain a sense of focus that is as compelling as the personalities that color its pages until the last section of the book. This section is devoted to the numinous Mamah, the woman for whom Wright left his first wife of 20 years. Mamah seems to have sent him into a spiral of fervent public defiance of the contemporary behavioral norms. As her story unfolds, details that previously seemed extraneous begin to fall into place. Though the reader knows how the story will end, the sense of foreboding and the emotional impact in the final cataclysm does not diminish. The florid effervescence of the rest of the work ends on a genuinely somber and powerfully affective note, hinting at what Boyle might accomplish if all his work could be as tightly constructed as this last segment. Boyle does not shy away from portraying every dimension, and every sordid detail, of his characters. Much is made of how often the characters sweat in the novel. They sweat while driving, lost in the steppes of rural Wisconsin and searching for Wright’s semi-mythical Taliesin. They sweat in the taxi driving through the sweltering heat of Tiajuana, in search of their next morphine fix. They sweat as they spend sleepless nights in jail cells, separated from their children. Much like Jonathan Swift—specifically in his satire “The Lady’s Dressing Room”—Boyle seems determined to expose the raw humanity behind ideals of free love and art—the age and decay of the flesh hidden beneath elaborate outfits and artfully applied rouge. Or perhaps Boyle merely wishes to debunk the notion that people in the early to mid 1900s did not sweat—they glistened.

It is not only expected but de rigueur in the cult of the North American suburban gothic that every SUV-driving, Levi’s-wearing mother secretly pops Adderall at her son’s soccer games or constantly downs Chardonnay to ease the pain of her husband’s extra-marital affair with his male coworker. Or something like that.James Boice echoes an all-too-common fear of sameness and suburban alienation when he describes the citizens of his hometown of Little Rocky Run, Virginia: “And they went to the gym after work and met their friends for happy hour and slept with their friends with condoms and became married at age twenty-seven and purchased a home and ventured forth in procreation.” At first, it’s almost ironic that Boice’s portrait seems like nothing new: “They had no structure to their faces. Their bones morphed into one another. They spoke the same syllables on top of one another, and they were cast out in the middle where they tore the plastic off their new shirts and tossed them in the washer in the year 1998.” It’s an era of unprecedented wealth, cartoon sitcoms and sex scandals: in a word, the Clinton Era.The dust jacket of “NoVA” (shorthand for Northern Virginia) reads like a recap of an episode of Desperate Housewives, promising to finally “scratch the shiny surface [of suburbia].” This topic may seem trite at worst and overworked at best, but Boice determinedly takes a stab at originality in examining the suicide of a seemingly-normal 17-year-old boy, and the context around that event, in excruciating detail.Within the first five pages, Boice has already delivered something more gruesome than banal. Grayson Donald has hanged himself from a basketball hoop: “His lunch has already made its way through the intestine and colon and now takes the form of hot brown shit cooling in the sagging seat of his Hanes boxer briefs. A hard-on protrudes from the crotch of his cargo pants.” It is November 2, and he’s been swinging by his neck all day. From this sort of morbid fascination, Boice’s blunt, transparent prose and disjointed vignettes evolve into a meticulous, disarmingly honest scrutiny of Little Rocky Run that ultimately condemns suburbia, but redeems his novel. Determined to elucidate Grayson’s motivation, Boice embarks on a series of character sketches that only vaguely cohere. These descriptions of the average American suburb initially read like an over-zealous attempt at a modern-day literary minimalism. In the first 50 pages, it seems that Boice might actually believe that a few vivid references to excrement and some well-placed expletives are enough to automatically lend his voice authenticity.But as “NoVA” continues, Boice’s neutered but lewd prose adeptly fleshes out the characters that make up Little Rocky Run with striking explicitness. He describes the people in Grayson’s life—family, friends, teachers, neighbors, Best-Buy employees—with arresting honesty. Vicki Donald, Grayson’s mother, is an avid pro-life Catholic who teaches high school Calculus. She is overweight and in her food-diary she writes, “I ask You to remind me when I crave a snack such as a ‘3 Musketeers’ to remember You on The Cross & how You had nothing to eat or drink.” She cooks frozen baked ziti for her family three times a week and hates her husband. Grayson’s father, John, was in the Army and is now an alcoholic and addicted to Internet porn. He’s on the Home Owner’s Association along with self-medicating middle-aged housewives who say things like; “’What’s cool about drugs and murder?[....]Sometimes what’s cool is actually doing the not-cool thing.” In approaching these tropes honestly, Boice holds them to a light that transcends cliché.Grayson’s friends are obsessed with women, pot, music, Nintendo, and SAT-prep, and are constantly “teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown because their hemp necklace might be gay.” Boice deftly illustrates the psyche of the teenager of 1998: totally self-absorbed, yet cripplingly self-conscious.Boice’s unapologetic bluntness renders these characters with startling realism. The archetypes of high school—the hot blond gym teacher who seems perpetually stoned, the “tool” who forgoes college to live at home and buy beer for high school parties with his mom’s credit card—morph into multi-dimensional personalities through his penetrating interior monologues. Through Boice’s rendering and Grayson’s eyes, they appear distinctly real yet disconnected from reality, each living in a microcosm of the delusion at work in “NoVA.” The harsh objectivity Boice uses only thinly veils Grayson’s earnestness in trying to understand his community, with its initially imperceptible undercurrent of violence, drug abuse, alcoholism, and neglect. When rejecting his parents’ Catholicism, he writes, “Think about it, Mom. Manifest Destiny, the Spanish Inquisition, the Crusades. History is stained with the blood of tragic and ultimately silly endeavors of which yours is a microcosm.” Eventually, Grayson becomes more and more cognizant of the fallacies of the deluded members of Little Rocky Run. In the end, it’s his community that facilitates his suicide. “NoVA” is another novel that criticizes the American Dream as a mind-numbing routine of frozen dinners, high school cafeterias, and TV reruns. Though Boice ultimately condemns Little Rocky Run, his novel succeeds not through his sensationalizing prose, but through his dark sense of humor, caustic perceptions, and compelling candor.

The Brits have a lot to boast about when it comes to their contribution to the definitive catalog of 80s tunes. With bands like Echo and the Bunnymen, Depeche Mode, and the Cure, it’s pretty obvious why time and again fledgling rock groups have appropriated the musical aesthetic of their compatriots. White Lies, a London based trio formerly known as Fear of Flying, is no exception to the rule. Featuring a nostalgic veneer of haunting melodies, morbid song titles, and even more melancholic lyrics, the outfit’s U.S. debut, “To Lose My Life...,” is a fitting tribute to the pantheon of 80s British music icons.  But White Lies can offer more than just a touch of despair. Despite their channeling of influences, they are a far cry from entirely derivative. White Lies has in part made their name from their more lighthearted, danceable fair. On “To Lose My Life...” they showcase their modern sound with an array of songs that run the gamut from the danceable to heart-wrenching. Unfortunately, the thematic content does not keep pace with this diversity and modernity. Throughout the album, White Lies eschew lyrical or topical gravitas in favor of the trite and the maudlin.The ease with which the band has transitioned into one of the newest indie rock darlings can be attributed to the alluring quality of lead singer Harry McVeigh’s streamlined vocals. Yet, this ability doesn’t fully compensate for the shallow character of the lyrics, which rely almost exclusively on repetitive themes of love, death, obsession, and the occasional depression-induced suicide. The songs are morbid at best, and at their worst, such as in the slow ballad “Nothing To Give,” deathly boring. Space age glittery synth beats overwhelm straining vocals, but fail to mask what is clearly a sub-par rendition of Cure-esque mope-rock.McVeigh often harps on simplified clichés about the inextricable link between love and death, though he does deliver his elementary lyrical content with a reserved aplomb that salvages a handful of good tunes. Gifted with an eerie and reverberating baritone reminiscent of Ian Curtis, McVeigh has an uncanny knack for delivering the most vacuous lyrics with commendable seriousness and brooding passion.  The title track, while arguably the strongest song on the album and the one with the most commercial appeal, sounds at times like the pubescent diary entries of a lovesick and paranoid teenager: “He said to lose my life or lose my love / That’s the nightmare I’ve been running from.” It gets even more bizarre when the band attempts to imbue the lyrics with sappy romanticism, as in the chorus: “Let’s grow old together / And die at the same time.” Likewise, many songs include hooks of catchy and simply crafted couplets with the explosive intensity of a jarring guitar to boot. But if White Lies aren’t more careful with their limited repertoire of lyrical influences, they’ll soon find themselves one swipe of the black eyeliner away from being hurtled into emo obscurity. But on “Fifty On Our Foreheads,” this tendency to wax melancholic is superseded by pulsing snare and bass, which transitions from an unassuming introduction to an uplifting finale. Opening with a soothing interplay between the swirling tones of the omnipresent synthesizer and pacing drums as the perfect complement to McVeigh’s initially understated tonalities, the track suddenly progresses into an exhilarating and momentous thrill ride that awakens the listener from what has otherwise been a rather lethargic and long-winded reverie on morbidity. Alas, a song that succeeds both lyrically and musically is a rarity. This discrepancy reveals that White Lies is still maturing, a necessary prerequisite before the band can produce more cohesive tracks that showcase a stronger, more original lyrical footing capable of complementing the solid instrumental backing. In “E.S.T.,” McVeigh sings, “I hope you remember me / I hope you pretend for me,” which seems to imply that the anxiety of mortality is clearly an issue for the band. But only time will tell if White Lies can branch out of their current influences to navigate through the wake of their recent hype.—Staff writer Eunice Y.

To say that Wavves’ latest work—an album with the inspired name “Wavvves”—is strangely dissonant would not be a criticism. To assert that some of its tracks are just noise, utterly indescribable as anything else, would be a statement of fact. To tell the artist that the vocals on “Wavvves” are drowned out by charged chaos, or that a strong buzz of feedback stifles his melodies, would be to acknowledge his accomplishments rather than to deplore his defects. Coming from indie rocker Nathan Williams, whose music is variously categorized as crust pop, noise punk or even “shitgaze”—a descriptive variant of “shoegaze”—it is not surprising that his second album is every bit as defiantly clamorous as the first. While similarly marked by drilling drumbeats and tense clashes of chords, “Wavvves” takes more risks with electric frequencies and unusual noises. Some of these risks pay off, producing an engaging and original sound, but many backfire in alienating and even annoying ways.For a newcomer to the industry—Williams released Wavves’ eponymous first LP in September 2008—his experimentation is brave to say the least, but the new tricks he pulls in “Wavvves” are actually quite limited in scope. The tracks vary little in mood and instrumentation, and when Williams experiments it is mostly with electronic beats, blares and buzzes—with the exception, perhaps, of some inspired sitar twangs early in “Killr Punx, Scary Demons.”Take, for example, the representative first track of “Wavvves,” entitled “Rainbow Everywhere.” A voiceless introduction to the album, the piece jumps between electric frequencies underneath heavy static and hovers around just a couple of simple chords. The track ends up sounding awfully reminiscent of an elongated modem dial-up tone. Similarly, the incessant static buzz of “More Fur,” with no tune or beat of which to speak, comes off as a four-minute sample of a bored child playing with a badly-wired microphone.This is not to say that boredom cannot act as a source of inspiration, however. In fact, it is in his dead-on depictions of idle frustration that Williams makes more thoughtful musical choices. “So Bored” uses some well-placed high whines and a catchy beat to call to mind a culturally starved American teenage boy fighting off total lethargy with his guitar. Along the same lines, the peppy persistence of “No Hope Kids” actually endows the song with humor as the lyrics develop from lighthearted denial of material needs—“got no car, got no money”—to more serious worries—“got no friends, got no family.” Such songs contribute to the general feeling that “Wavvves” does not always reach its potential. Williams’ redundancy in “Summer Goth,” for instance, in which he repeats the unoriginal phrase “I can’t wait to get home and wrap my arms ’round you” sounds especially uninteresting when compared with the strongest song on the LP, “Jetplane (Staying on a).” Beginning with a heavy beat but soft vocals in a content apathy, the piece develops a melody that tenses up with the introduction of electronic flares and static creeping into the background. The distortion of one key repeated phrase in the song and the eventual clumsy breakdown of the tune into silence lend it an incredible power of allegory for decay, like a sunny day degenerating into a damp and cloudy afternoon. Much of the rest of the album, however, is plagued with incomprehensible lyrics and tiring reverberations of electric blares.In an attempt to reshape the genre of noise pop, then, “Wavvves” has removed the essential infectious melodies and beats. In the best of the genre, music emerges from the noise and occasional harmonies clarify overwhelming dissonances. Carefree chaos and defiant strength become nonsensical, not mysterious or intriguing, when nothing stands in contrast. Similar no-fi bands like No Age and Abe Vigoda express in their work an implicit understanding that powerful beats and electronic tones work best in the support of catchy tunes. “Wavvves” only demonstrates Williams’ failure to realize his impressive artistic potential.

Of all the malaises facing indie pop, few can be more odious than the conceit of turning that simple thing, a song title, into a needlessly complex and irrelevant bit of intellectual posturing. Even a band like Bishop Allen, which continues their light-hearted brand of pop/rock on their third album “Grr…,” are not immune to this malady. A song about a dysfunctional relationship is titled “South China Moon,” an image that, while repeated throughout the song, does nothing to advance its meaning. To be fair, this device is as old as rock and roll. There is more than an echo of The Beatles’ “Isn’t it good / Norwegian Wood” in Bishop Allen’s “I’ll come back to you / South China Moon.” Its use, however, is representative of a larger theme of this new album. Co-frontmen Justin A. Rice ’99 and Christian A. Rudder ’98 share mic and songwriting duties with Rudder writing the bulk of the songs this time around, and the result is a safe, predictable work that obeys genre conventions without challenging them. “Grr…” always keeps the listener mildly engaged while making no real impact. This pattern is established on the first track, “Dimmer,” which opens with soft, driving bass and percussion before moving into a self-deprecating account of Rudder’s insecurities.  All of it—the theme, the frail and vulnerable vocals, the clean production and the reliance on pop form—play to expectations. “I would pick the darkest horse / that’s the horse I’d ride,” he sings. Would an indie pop frontman pick any other? “Dimmer” is a catchy enough piece of music, but it fails to develop after the first few chords, and repeated listens reveal no real nuance or subtlety, something that is true all-too-often of the songs on this album. Bass, electric guitar and drums are augmented elsewhere by acoustic guitar and that indie pop favorite, keyboards. Strings are largely absent as Bishop Allen choose a simpler sound that emphasizes their songwriting. This might seem like a wise decision, as Rice and Rudder have acquired a reputation for witty wordplay and elegant storytelling, but on “Grr…” the songwriting disappoints most of all. To be sure, there is the odd line that stands out for refreshing cleverness or insight; in the otherwise drab “Don’t Hideaway,” “I’m going to write you a letter / every day you like you were a debtor” humorously captures the stalker-like intensity with which the narrator commands his beloved not to “hideaway.” But these instances are notable chiefly for their rarity.A much more representative example of the songwriting comes from “Cue the Elephants”: “The morning belonged to the grapefruit / Ripe in the gold Roman sun.” This kind of pretension is more grating even than that of “South China Moon” and, once again, represents the genre at its worst. An isolated instance of clever wordplay does not an Elvis Costello make.  That is not to say that “Grr…” is uniformly without merit. There are moments, few as they are in this album, where Bishop Allen does move beyond the formula. The band is most potent on the four-song stretch from “Dirt on Your Shoes” to “True and False.” “Dirt on Your Shoes” is the strongest, because it is the only song that grows and surprises, moving from a generic acoustic opening to a power-chord-filled chorus, accompanied by a lyrical tone of caustic attack rather than the complacent introspection that characterizes the rest of the album. It is the only song that possesses that vital quality that “Grr…” as a whole sorely lacks: dynamism. By contrast, “Oklahoma” is sunny and even joyous, with chiming arpeggios helping to create a genuinely enjoyable, if minor, diversion. “Oklahoma” leads into “The Ancient Commonsense of Things,” where a pretty melody complements a theme, as stated in the title, that is the album’s one departure from the typical concerns of the genre. Prettiest of all is “True and False,” where guest vocalist Darbie Nowatka successfully captures the sweet vulnerability that Rudder cannot. These pleasant interludes are the highlights of what is, unquestionably, a mediocre album. “Grrr…” suffers both from its lack of ambition and its dreary songwriting. Their last effort, “Broken String,” while not a radical effort, was expansive and risky by comparison, and coming two years later, “Grrr…” feels like a retreat. Without focus and ambition, Bishop Allen risk losing all claims to aesthetic necessity.

After a long night of drinking, pissing, and pissing people off, singer Eddie Argos stumbles into his  support group meeting only to find himself the subject of Art Brut’s new short film, creatively titled “Drunk?: a documentary” and set to their new single “Alcoholics Unanimous”—wait, see what they did there? Still belligerent and sweaty from the night before, Argos signs himself in and sits down among his peers. “Bring me tea! Bring me coffee!” he screams to anyone who will listen, but everyone seems to be drinking beer and wine. Just what he doesn’t need! The irony! We soon learn that Eddie wasn’t exactly the most pleasant person that night, as he sends out a mass apology text saying whatever happened “will NEVER happen again.” What could this amiable character possibly have done to anger all his friends? Did he bite someone’s face, leaving that gaping hole in his teeth? Did he ditch his colorfully-scarved yuppie friends for the strange Clockwork Orange-themed couple in his support group? Or maybe his habit of spitting at women simply isn’t that attractive during the nighttime? Who knows? It’s a mystery.All we know for sure is it left Argos with the mother of all hangovers. “I’m hiding it well,” he claims, only to hear his contrary friends respond, “Not very well!” Yet it’s Argos who wins out in the end; while the rest of his group ends up in a huge brawl, intoxicated by post-punk power chords—oh, and the alcohol at the alcoholics meeting might have helped—Argos is left the last man standing. Alive, awake and ready to do it all again.—Will L. Fletcher

Lil’ Wayne has conquered the rap world but he isn’t a rock star just yet. With lead single “Prom Queen” off his upcoming rock debut “Rebirth,” he crosses over into a land few rappers ever cared to go to. No, not the rock world. High school. But Lil’ Wayne has the skills to survive in his preppy environment. Well, presuming the face tats don’t freak anyone out anyway. He plays the guitar—probably about as well as that douche you hated who slept with your girlfriend.Lil’ Wayne fearlessly flouts convention by playing only chords and notes that spare him the inconvenience of hand movement, most apparent on his bold three-note solo. But on the bright side, the guitar on “Prom Queen” is simple enough that it can be learned by watching the video. Lil’ Wayne and Dave Meyers, who co-directed “Prom Queen,” were probably aware that Lil’ Wayne’s guitar skills aren’t really hard-rocking, nor rocking at all. They attempt to raise the level of rock in “Prom Queen” by employing a gratuitous dose of seizure-inducing camera effects. Bluish stage lights flash constantly, scene changes occur in sporadic bursts, and every drum fill thrashes the camera like an earthquake. The inspired music is matched by a truly inspired story: Lil’ Wayne used to have a high school crush who, in an unprecedented move, refused his advances. Well now Lil’ Wayne is rich and famous and she’s been left by her boyfriend to raise their child alone.  The child is probably ugly. So years later, after “Tha Carter” tops the charts and Lil’ Wayne sweeps the Grammy’s, she shows up at one of his shows only to get pushed away. The moral of the story is not to say no to Lil’ Wayne lest you end up poor and lonely.—Mark A. Fusunyan

With his recognizable bald pate, full ginger beard, and voice soaked in Kentucky moonshine, Will Oldham—also known as Bonnie “Prince” Billy—occupies a constellation of his own in the alt-country scene. A prolific artist, he has been releasing albums for the last 15 years under a variety of names, including Palace, Palace Music, Palace Brothers, and Bonnie Billy, as well as moonlighting as an actor in indie films like “Wendy and Lucy” and “Old Joy.” Oldham’s music laces granola folk with violins and soulful vocals to create slow, poignant rhythms. One of his albums, “The Letting Go,” was recorded in Reykjavík, Iceland, and indeed, many of his songs transplant this glacial desolation to the American landscape of front porches and dark country nights.
Listeners will get none of that in his latest effort. “Beware,” Oldham’s 15th studio album, moves into the major key, fleshing out the sparse chords of his previous recordings for a more expansive, upbeat sound. It kicks off to a country-western start with the jangly “Beware Your Only Friend,” featuring fiddles, percussion, and a full gospel choir. “I want to be your only friend,” Oldham croons, echoed by a bevy of perky female vocalists singing, “Is that scary?” By the end of the song, Oldham’s voice strains as he attempts to raise it over a rising cacophony of accordions, guitars, and additional back-up vocals, now chiming in with a shrill, “Beware of me.”
A few tracks later, the title “You Don’t Love Me” holds out the promise of a bittersweet confection. But instead the song is playful, with handclaps and facile lyrics like “You say you like my eyes or just the way I giggle / sometimes you like the smell of me or how my stomach jiggles / but you don’t love me / that’s alright.” Most of the Oldham repertoire features unpredictable chord changes, but here the carnival atmosphere melts into stale poppy hooks, adorned by an occasional Nashville flourish pulled from the shelf.
It’s difficult to determine if these missteps are intended to be humorous or ironic, as their lyrics suggest—if they are, they certainly miss the mark. Luckily, the album’s silliest songs are front-loaded; Oldham regains his footing in the second half of the album. “You Are Lost” strips away the backup vocalists, replacing them with a lush wall of strings to accompany the words, “You are lost inside the sound.” “I Don’t Belong To Anyone” couches Oldham’s tender broodings in pleasant country cadences, coasting to a smooth-edged finish. And in “There Is Something I Have to Say,” Oldham updates the raw José González-style singer-guitar combo with a wash of icy background ambience and a minimalist layering of his own voice for a haunting, lovely effect.
“Beware” is in many ways the culmination of Oldham’s career trajectory; his sound has gradually moved away from the spare stylings of albums like “I See A Darkness” (which Johnny Cash liked so much he later recorded his own version with Oldham on backup) toward more polished studio trimmings. But in pulling in all the extra instruments (marimba, flute, tenor saxophone, and accordian, to name a few) it loses something of the stark devastation that gave voice to America’s stranger corners of existence. The album’s title should in the end serve as a warning to Oldham himself—amidst all the banjos and choirs, the warm shadowy spaces between the words may be lost.

Watching her fiancé conduct a phone conversation with an unidentified acquaintance, Zooey (Rashida L. Jones ’97) suddenly turns around and gleefully signals to her girlfriends, “It’s a date!” Her approval of her husband-to-be’s apparent infidelity is explained away by her friends’ enthusiastic responses: “It’s a man-date! This is a man-date!”Their excitement is understandable, since the cult of male friendship has been endorsed on film for decades—imagine Abbott without Costello or Maverick without Goose. Lest we take this sacred institution for granted, “I Love You, Man,” the latest effort from “Along Came Polly” director John Hamburg, conducts a humorous investigation into the pitfalls of a life lacking in bromance.“Here’s the deal,” Robbie Klaven (Andy Samberg) informs Zooey, his future sister-in-law. “Peter’s always been a girlfriend guy. He put all his focus and energy into relationships, and all his dude friends just fell by the wayside.” With a wedding date fast approaching and a severe dearth of male acquaintances, California realtor Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) arranges a series of uncomfortable “man-dates” in order to find a Best Man and flesh out his half of the wedding party. Rudd has mastered the task of playing the haplessly endearing male lead, and his struggle to be one of the boys is simultaneously laughable and charming.Peter eventually hits it off with supposedly employed slacker Sydney Fife (Jason Segel). Rudd and Segel have worked together on two Judd Apatow films already—“Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Knocked Up”—and the strong chemistry between them is evident onscreen. In fact, it’s easy to mistake “I Love You, Man” for an Apatow film. The typically comical, awkward conversations and crude humor are provided by a quirky cast including Andy Samberg as the voice of reason to his clueless older brother; Lou Ferrigno, television’s former “Incredible Hulk”; and J.K. Simmons, essentially reprising his role as the father in “Juno.”Unlike Apatow, however, Hamburg focuses on the intricacies and discrepancies between genders when it comes to same-sex bonding. Peter is often made painfully aware of just how open Zooey and her girlfriends can be with each other, especially when discussing their love lives. He calls for an end to this full disclosure, until he finds himself revealing the same kind of information to his new pal Sydney. Eventually hanging out for seven-hour stretches with Sydney and bailing on dates with Zooey, Peter must also learn to curb his bro time.Despite the premise of heterosexual bonding in “I Love You, Man,” it somehow gets caught up and confused throughout most of the movie with homosexual intimacy. Andy Samberg’s character, Robbie, is gay, yet the majority of his boyfriends are formerly straight men—he appears only slightly nonplussed by this fact. Peter’s social advances and friendship with Sydney are often mistaken for homosexuality as well. Whether this is a reflection of common stigmas regarding male friendship or a cheap ploy to garner extra laughs, it quickly becomes redundant.Good intentions notwithstanding, Sydney ultimately causes a rift in Peter and Zooey’s relationship. Still, even faced with this downturn, Hamburg never drops the comedic ball. The movie’s implicit messages are buoyed by brisk, funny maxims: “Society tells us to act civilized, but the truth is, we’re animals, and sometimes you’ve gotta let it out,” Sydney informs Peter after going berserk on a Venice Beach visitor. The lighthearted mood is sustained by sunny California city views and a playful soundtrack including Vampire Weekend and The Flaming Lips. Though “I Love You, Man” tests the foundations on which male companionship stands, it does so without losing itself in unnecessarily heavy social commentary, instead managing to  maintain a sense of humor—albeit a sophomoric one—throughout.

“Spinning Into Butter” displays enough unintentional racism in 86 minutes to keep Al Sharpton busy for the next century. First-time director Mark Brokaw aspires to contribute to an intelligent dialogue about race, but ends up creating a misguided After School Special. Despite its pedagogical goals, the ridiculous dialogue, shallow characters, and uninteresting plot prevent the film from raising any fruitful questions.The movie is based on the acclaimed play of the same name and was written for the screen by the original playwright, Rebecca Gilman. The play was named one of the best productions of 1999 by Time, but the exasperatingly clichéd film will not receive any such honor.The plot centers on a series of racist threats received by a black student at the predominantly white Belmont College in Vermont. The ensuing uproar at the small liberal arts school reveals hidden prejudices, brings tension bubbling to the surface, and leads to violence. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Sarah Daniels, the newly hired Dean of Students who strives for sensitivity yet needs to keep her job. Dean Daniels struggles to find a balance between protecting the targeted student and appeasing the administration, all while falling for Aaron Carmichael (Mykelti Williamson), a black reporter covering the story. (Not surprisingly, neither expresses familiarity with the term “conflict of interest.”)In the movie’s first scene, a student passionately refuses to define his ethnicity in a classic “checkbox” dilemma. At stake is a $12,000 scholarship offered only to minority students, but Patrick (Victor Rasuk) does not identify with his Puerto Rican roots on principle. The desired effect is admiration for his idealism, but a low-income college student turning down thousands of dollars essentially because he “hasn’t even been to Puerto Rico” smacks of pretension. His feeble arguments against accepting the money sound especially forced when a financial aid snafu later reveals how badly he could use it.The film relies predominantly on unfortunate stereotypes that place characters in racially charged scenarios. The out of touch, all-white administration’s only response to campus racism is to hold forums on race for the entire school. Predictably, these forums devolve into a brawl. The liberal white students feel unfairly blamed for mistreating the minority students. The minority students want to be called “students of color.” Patrick yells about having to compromise for his scholarship, but the white students yell that they don’t get any scholarships. The violence begins, like all race riots seem to, with a rousing and ill-received “You people!”In a movie so ostensibly concerned with breaking down prejudices, it’s disturbing that so many characters have no identity outside their race. Almost every supporting character’s lines are interchangeable with those of any other member of his race. Dean Daniels and her reporter paramour break from this pattern, but only because the most incredulous lines are reserved for them alone. When asked why she would “even want to help these kids,” Daniels earnestly responds, “Because the world isn’t fair. People keep getting their asses handed to them. Why shouldn’t we try and change that?”Many of the movie’s problems likely stem from the stage-to-screen transplant. The strictly color-coded groups of students are carelessly presented in the film, but would have more easily emerged as symbolic in a play. The coordinated yells of the supposedly riotous crowd sound more like the choreographed gangs of Bob Fosse than the visceral mobs of Spike Lee.A twist concerning the culprit of the original threats offers an interesting initial shock, but the lack of satisfying explanation renders it irrelevant to the movie’s larger message. A student forms a new discussion group—supposedly a symbol of progress on campus—but reveals he only wants the extracurricular to pad his law school application.The open ending of “Spinning Into Butter” does not lead to a nuanced or fresh way of discussing race relations. Instead, the loose ends result in any number of dubious conclusions. After a particularly heated argument, Carmichael reassures Daniels by reminding her that “some people don’t even know they’re racist,” but he has no thoughts on what to do after she recognizes her latent prejudices. Likewise, the film will touch a nerve with viewers, but it fails to provide meaningful commentary on the issues that it so wantonly raises.—Staff writer Charleton A.

“Someday we’re not gonna be here,” says protagonist Troy Gable in “The Great Buck Howard,” “and if that’s the case, I wanna spend the time I have here doing something that makes my heart race.” Coming from most characters, this statement might sound heartfelt, if somewhat trite. In the context of this film, however, Troy simply sounds insane.Troy (Colin Hanks) is a young law student who drops out of school against his father’s wishes, having decided that writing is his true calling. When this dream doesn’t materialize immediately, he decides to accept the first job he can find and ends up becoming the road manager for Buck Howard, a self-important, washed-up mentalist hoping to relive his former fame. Troy’s father (Tom Hanks, both on screen and in reality) cannot understand his decision—and neither can the audience.Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is nasty in person and not very talented on stage. His signature fist pump of a handshake and the catchphrases that turn up in every performance quickly become tiresome. Buck’s story is based on the life of The Amazing Kreskin—the mentalist and TV performer who achieved a brief moment of fame in the 1970s—but Malkovich’s performance turns him into a two-dimensional cartoon.For some reason, Buck’s old-timey routine fascinates Troy. “He was cheesy, no denying that, but he also seemed to have a timeless charm that the audience loved,” Troy says in voiceover as the camera captures different moments of Buck’s act. The film must rely on telling the audience how to perceive Buck, because it’s hard to see any of this purported “timeless charm” in Buck’s shows. From his coin drop trick to his famous illusion in which he finds money that the audience has hidden, his performances are not particularly exciting. It is difficult to muster the same desire to learn the secrets of his tricks that his audiences in the film seem to have.Buck is supposed to be a symbol of small-town America; he may not be glamorous and he has lost his nationwide fame, but he maintains a sense of pride in what he does.  Toward the end of the film, Buck admits to Troy, “I don’t really belong in Vegas anymore. I belong in places like these... I love these towns. I love these people.” This would be a touching confession, if his attitude towards provincial living weren’t so condescending throughout the film. At one show in Ohio, he refers to the husband and wife who run the theatre as “these two hayseeds,” and is furious at the amateur introduction the woman gives to his act.The film’s high points are the moments in which Troy, rather than Buck, is the focus of the action. A young man’s struggle to reconcile his desire to follow his passion and his need for a paying job is both captivating and particularly relevant during the country’s current economic state. Troy’s confrontations with his father are some of the most absorbing moments in the film, and not just because it is amusing to see Tom Hanks and Colin Hanks together on screen as father and son. The dramatic tension between these two characters is far beyond anything Buck Howard can create with his magic acts.Troy sticks steadfastly to his decision to do what he loves, rather than what is most profitable. Seeing his determination, it is impossible not to admire him, though perhaps not as ardently as Buck’s publicist Valerie (Emily Blunt). However, after watching Buck Howard’s routine again and again for 90 minutes, one is more inclined to believe Valerie when she says, “Life is not magical. No one is supposed to do anything.”—Staff writer Rachel A. Burns can be reached at rburns@fas.harvard.edu.

“It’s just like cleaning up a house, but there’s blood there,” Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) explains nonchalantly to her younger sister Norah (Emily Blunt) in “Sunshine Cleaning,” the new film from the producers of “Little Miss Sunshine.” Her cool, collected approach to such absurd proposals—a crime scene cleanup business, in this case—epitomizes what Big Beach Films continues to get right, despite its predictable recipe for indie flick humor.The biohazard removal business shines as a beacon of hope for the film’s lovable, but not particularly successful, sisterly duo. Adams plays a once-popular cheerleader having an affair with her married ex-quarterback, ex-boyfriend Mac (Steve Zahn). Their son Oscar (Jason Spevack) is in desperate need of expensive, individualized private school enrollment thanks to his habit of licking walls at his current public school. Norah has even less to look forward to in the morning. In the words of her sister, “You don’t go to school, you don’t have a job, and you live with Dad”—the stubborn grandfather figure once again played by Alan Arkin.Mac’s suggestion that Rose quit her day job as a maid and become a different kind of cleaning lady offers both girls a chance to turn their lives around. Through shared triumph over hardship—disposing of everything from a finger to a maggot-infested paper bag—the girls move from insulting one another to forming a substantial and trusting relationship.The film’s premise, inspired by a National Public Radio report on two best friends’ real-life foray into the biohazard removal business, is refreshingly far-fetched. Every other aspect of the film, however, begs to be compared to Big Beach’s Oscar-nominated 2006 release, “Little Miss Sunshine.” From the Albuquerque setting to the overuse of the word “sunshine” to the pivotal presence of a dilapidated van, there is a lot we’ve seen already. Arkin’s grandfather character appears to have risen from the dead to star in yet another film, although this time it is he and not Greg Kinnear who is hooked on get-rich-quick schemes. Even the storyline follows the same arc as its predecessor. So which film deserves the title of “Sunshine?”Surprisingly, the parallels between the two films work. Big Beach may be a one-trick pony, but the trick is excellent; the mix of quirky personalities, preposterous situations, biting sarcasm, and slapstick is every bit as effective as it was three years ago. The difference here is the increasingly somber tone of the plot. The “Little Miss Sunshine” pageant threatened a young girl’s self-image, but these characters’ decisions affect their entire futures. “Sunshine Cleaning” evokes less laughs and perhaps more reflection than its counterpart, but the somber moments are more affecting, and ultimately more relatable. What the new “Sunshine” has that the old lacks is, quite simply, Norah. Brash and deadpan, her idea of lulling her nephew to sleep is telling him a bedtime story about a man with OCD. British actress Blunt—best known for her role as the bitchy co-worker in “The Devil Wears Prada”—adds just the right amount of sensitivity to undercut her character’s sarcastic wit, which would grow tiresome in the hands of a lesser actress.The more subdued Rose is touching but less convincing. Even though she calls herself “a fucking loser,” her insecurities don’t always seem genuine. Her puppy dog eyes bewitch many of the film’s characters, but fail to persuade the audience that her setbacks are truly as grave as she believes them to be. If the film really is “Little Miss Sunshine 2.0,” its greatest success lies in the updated evolution of the central characters. “Little Miss” chronicled the journey of some lovable protagonists accepting the slow collapse of their odd dreams—writing a book, winning a pageant, becoming a pilot. “Cleaning” does this too, but then allows the characters to find salvation in the unlikeliest of places, breaking self-destructive cycles and pursuing new paths to success. We’ve seen most of this movie before, but the extra mile taken by “Cleaning” is well worth the journey.

Though the National Book Critics Circle Award carries no money, its posthumous awarding to Roberto Bolaño for his monster of a work, “2666,” raises a host of unsettling questions about the place of prizes, especially monetized prizes, in the world of letters. It’s not that “2666” was not a great work or that I feel it shouldn’t have won. In fact, though I have to admit I haven’t finished it, I have a hard time believing that there could be another piece of fiction from 2008 that is more ambitious, more expansive, more powerful than Bolaño’s book—that there is any other book more deserving. Rather, the problems that I see all stem from that simple piece of common knowledge: Bolaño is dead. When the award was presented to the translator, Natasha Wimmer, the author himself was a thoughtless corpse decomposing in his lime-strewn grave.Awards should be given to the best book. I don’t dispute that. And in the case of the National Book Critics Circle Award, as I’ve already stated, I have no real problem with its awarding. Yet I can’t help but feel that there is something backward-looking about even giving an award to a dead man. Yes, the work should be honored, but—and here is the crux of my argument—are prizes supposed to merely be reactive? Are they not supposed to encourage further production of literature along with merely honoring the good work of the past? Should there not be a proactive element to prizes? I have to say that, as unpopular as the Swedish Academy is these days, the Nobel Prize Committee has got it right in this respect: no posthumous prizes. They dole out their dough only to writers who will use the money to continue to write; they bestow their attention only on those who can directly benefit from a greater demand for their work. To the chagrin of aficionados of Borges and John H. Updike ’54, the list of accolades and honors in their biographies will never include the words “Nobel Laureate.” And while I agree that Borges and Updike outshone—in influence, most definitely, and in skill, most probably—the likes of laureates such as Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, there is no reason to give them laureate status now just so future generations of their family can burnish the trophy. After all, the quality of Borges or Updike’s literary output is in no way diminished by the fact that a prize was never received.America’s flagship prize, the Pulitzer Prize, has given out three literature prizes posthumously, squandering its hefty award sum (today it weighs in at $10,000) on the family of the deceased. How does this serve to promote the arts? It might permit the prize committee to pat themselves on the back for their good taste in recognizing the works of geniuses after their time has passed (they gave the award to Sylvia Plath 19 years after her suicide and John Kennedy Toole 11 after his), but how does it do any lover of literature any good? How does it serve to inspire new creative works? I know it may sound insensitive, but I cannot believe that the purpose of the prizes given out in this country is to console the family of the bereaved. Perhaps if recognition is felt to be really important, if an attempt to rectify an unmerited critical disregard is felt absolutely necessary, a special recognition can be given, like the lifetime achievement award given by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. I understand that certain prize-giving committees are limited by their founding documents to giving out only a certain number and type of prizes, etc., but offering up money to the dead truly is nonsensical and counterproductive. It is a difficult issue to resolve, especially when, as was the case last year, a book written by a dead man was probably the most deserving of awards, and I don’t pretend to have a perfect solution. To choose to disqualify anyone based upon extra-literary considerations opens the door for all sorts of petty politicking—something the literary realm definitely needs no more of.  However, the case is that, in the cash-strapped world of letters, it is more important than ever that the moneys within are channeled to the warm bodies that can produce the next White Whale and not to skeletons that will merely rest in the muck.   —Columnist Sanders I.

For most, the concept of creativity is most quickly associated with art. For James Croft and Edward Clapp, creators of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (GSE) Creativity Discussion Group, creativity can be found everywhere—not only in art, but in science, cuisine, sports, and cognition.Every Tuesday, faculty and students from Harvard meet informally to discuss creativity in different contexts, using anecdotes, allegories, and sometimes even props to express their personal understanding of this abstract idea. Participants of this Discussion Group identify a wide range of creative pursuits—from creating electricity with dirt to demonstrating the definition of the word with Legos.Held at the GSE on Appian Way, the Creativity Discussion Group was created after the Task Force for the Arts released its report last December. Both Croft, a visual artist, and Clapp, who has a long history of acting in theater, are doctoral students in the GSE and were motivated by the report’s publication to make their idea for a forum on the definition of creativity into a reality. Every week, in order to focus discussion and spark conversation, one member presents a scholar’s theory of creativity before participants begin an informal debate about this particular philosophy.Croft and Clapp insist that finding a definition of creativity, while vague, is urgent for practical purposes. Troubled by how an increase in standardized testing in public schools and higher instruction has pushed arts education to the periphery of curricula, Croft and Clapp hope the group will offer suggestions for ways that creativity should be taught or encouraged in elementary and secondary schools, as well as in universities.“The arts are not in danger… but the arts don’t have the educational importance that the strength in society would suggest they might,” Croft says.  “Creativity is a fundamental characteristic of what it means to be a human being…if educational spaces think that this is a frill, that that is something that is not essential to the enterprise of educating people, then they are just wrong.”Croft and Clapp also emphasize that the Discussion Group aims to investigate the relationship between arts and creativity as separate but overlapping entities. Rather than being mutually inclusive, creativity is essential to and arises from all disciplines.“Creativity is a hollow word that takes on different meanings in different contexts,” Clapp says. He and Croft insist that artists do not have a sole claim on creativity. “Most people want to consider themselves creative,” Croft says. “Your idea of what creativity is is very bound up with your idea of who you are as a person and what you do. In a way artists are the worst people to discuss creativity with because it’s so personal for them. We try to include both artists and people who do not consider themselves artists in the discussion.”The Creativity Discussion Group also incorporates monthly colloquia into its schedule, which makes the interdisciplinary application of creativity more concrete. The colloquia feature research conducted by students and faculty from Harvard and other institutions, such as Emerson College, Lesley University, and the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Especially in the current state of economic decline, the colloquia have provided a relatively inexpensive platform for people to present their research.Last month at the inaugural colloquium, Eric Rosenbaum, a researcher at MIT, presented an interactive demonstration of technology that takes light from objects and overexposes it in real time. The technique allowed audience members to use anything that emitted light to “paint” an image projected onto a screen.“It’s quite remarkable how a technology like that can transform the way people see themselves,” Croft says. “Suddenly people can be artists in a very real sense.”At the most recent colloquium, which was held on Tuesday, Jill Peterson, a researcher from RISD, presented a fabric bike lock she designed, which also serves as a GPS social networking device.The colloquia are evidence that artistic creation is thriving in college communities. Croft believes that while some are pessimistic about the vivacity of the arts in society, in fact, people are as creatively inclined as ever. This creativity, however, may present itself in ways that are not traditionally considered artistic.He points to the popularity of YouTube as evidence of people’s intense natural urge to express themselves. “Suddenly it’s been made easy to express yourself in ways you couldn’t before. And suddenly you see that this idea of the artist, the creative individual as someone blessed with some sort of spirit from the muses or what have you is wrong. This is all of us. The human species has the gift of the muses. And that’s a remarkable discovery.”Clapp and Croft don’t have a specific goal in mind for the trajectory of the weekly discussions. They are satisfied as long as people are making personal connections and thinking about creativity in innovative ways with renewed enthusiasm.“My goal is to connect things that are already in existence,” Clapp says. “Harvard is not an arts-poor community; it is an arts poorly-connected community. There are rich conversations happening everywhere. I just want to have these conversations together.”

At just under five feet tall, with a head of two-toned—red and white—hair shaped in a severe, down-to-business bob, and a raspy voice characteristic of the French, Agnès Varda is impossible to miss. Besides the fact that she is essentially the only famous female filmmaker to have emerged during the French New Wave in the 1960s—an aesthetic turning point in the history of film when naturalistic settings and real-life plot lines challenged traditional, cheesy Hollywood conventions—Varda is a powerhouse.Varda was celebrated at the Harvard Film Archive’s retrospective, “Ciné-Varda,” a combination of film screenings and lectures that took place this past week from March 8-16. Demonstrating the same independent streak that runs through her films, Varda left quite an impression on Harvard: she refused to be interviewed by a Harvard Gazette reporter who admitted to not sitting through her installation video, “Les Veuves de Noirmoutier” (“The Widows of Noirmoutier”). The video is currently exhibited in the Carpenter Center.Despite her tough demeanor, however, Varda is a people person. Like her films, she digs to the very core of humanity and allows it to resurface, placing her camera exactly where it needs to be in order to piece together compelling, altogether beautiful and haunting stories.Varda began her career in the arts as a photographer, but she yearned to go beyond the still image in her work. Her most recent film, “Les plâges d’Agnès” (“The Beaches of Agnes”) is an autobiographical portrait of her life and work that premiered at Venice Film Festival, was awarded best French film of the year by the French Union of Film Critics, and garnered a French Cesar for Best Documentary. In the film Varda discusses how, as a photographer, she imagined cinema was simply photography, but with dialogue. “This was a stupid thought,” said Varda in an interview. “Cinema is not a still image plus dialogue. When I found this out, that was the minute I went from photography to cinema. I understood cinema was my thing because it is movement, it’s duration, it’s time, it’s words—if you need them—it’s music…it’s a total art, total expression. I think it is even the art of today.” Varda’s first feature film, “La pointe courte” (1954), stars local fishermen and their families as themselves, a technique she often uses in her work, which blends documentary and fiction. One of her most celebrated films, “Sans toit ni loi” (“Vagabond”), tells the story of a young wandering girl, Mona (Sandrine Bonnaire), as she marches toward her inevitable death. In preparation for the film, Varda became a vagabond herself, wandering and meeting people who would not only inspire characters in the film, but would also play themselves, speaking lines written by Varda. This is an unusual method for filmmakers—so unusual that it merited Varda’s development of her own term—‘cinécriture’ (film writing, or film essay)—to describe her way of approaching and piecing together a film. “It’s very interesting to decide that you want to capture some images and not others,” Varda said. “It’s the choice. What I call ‘cinécriture.’ The choices you make about what you choose as images, how long you show them—do you use a traveling shot or a still shot? Do you want people to speak, be silent, or to sing?” Varda’s instincts are greatly influenced by the reality of the images as she experiences them—both as a human being and as a filmmaker.While Varda’s work is diverse and prolific, ranging from feature films and documentaries to short chronicles of her daily life, to installation pieces, Varda recognizes the importance of her humanity, of leaving some parts of the world out of the frame. “I’m not a maniac with a camera,” Varda said.“People know that I work out of affection, empathy and love,” she continued. “This is not fake. I’m interested in people. When I’m filming, I try to get something that I can catch. Every body has its beauty; everybody has some particularity, some specific thing that is interesting to try to catch. So I’m curious, and that’s helped me a great deal. Not badly curious, but curious.” This curiosity is apparent and contagious. Her documentary “Les glaneurs et la glaneuse” (“The Gleaners and I”) is an investigation with traces of self-portraiture that explores the act of gleaning in rural communities, on the streets, and in the art world. The film demonstrates Varda’s command behind the camera and the trust she quickly gains with her subjects. Her capturing is not passive. She challenges those she films and attacks their inconsistencies. She brings forth passion and vulnerability.At a lunch conference with students at the Graduate School of Design, Varda was asked to give advice for budding filmmakers. Like her films, which serve to question rather than provide answers, Varda responded: “No advice. No message. No certainty. No explanation. No message.  I wouldn’t do that.  I would say—stay alive.  I would say, avoid hard drugs. That’s my only advice.”                                                                           —Staff writer Mia P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not difficult to find posters of Pink Floyd or the latest Hollywood hottie gracing the walls of student dorms. But original Harvard student artwork? Not so much. Paris A. Spies-Gans ’09 and Margaret M. Wang ’09 want to change that.This year they organized the first annual Harvard Student Art Show, which will take place the afternoon of May 4. Wholly student-run, this inchoate event seeks to provide Harvard artists with a forum to display and sell their art. It’s unique—the first of its kind at Harvard—and the show’s organizers have secured the grassy expanse in front of the Science Center as a location for the show’s tent. Visibility is key, and as the hub of student culture, this space is the most strategic location for the show.Prices will start at around $20, appealing to both student palates and student budgets, and increase to indeterminately higher numbers. The higher-priced pieces will target professors, collectors, and curators. Through such a wide range of prices, the show’s organizers hope to make student art more readily accessible to a wide range of buyers.Spies-Gans and Wang first conceived the idea for the show at the annual Harvard arts leaders’ luncheon, where undergraduate Jane K. Cheng ’09 raised the question of where students could sell their pieces. When it became clear that no such venue existed, Spies-Gans and Wang turned to each other, both struck by the same idea. They approached Office of Fine Arts Director (OFA) Jack Megan immediately after the luncheon to pitch the project of Harvard’s first student-run art show.Megan was thrilled with the idea and eager to help Spies-Gans and Wang get started. “It lets [Harvard students] know what’s happening at Harvard and raises awareness about where artists work and live,” he said. “For the moment, it’s really about calling attention to and raising awareness about the presence of art and art-makers at Harvard.”The Harvard Student Art Show is a university-wide effort. Organizers have reached out to students from the college and all the graduate schools. Professors from all the schools, including the college’s Visual and Environmental Studies Department, have been very receptive to the idea; some have publicized the show to their students while others have allowed show organizers to give brief presentations during their classes. Student artists have been extremely amenable to the idea. In regard to artists’ positive responses, Megan said, “There has been great interest and a willingness to pass the word.”When asked about the show’s relevance to the general student body, Megan said, “Harvard students are very creative figures. Creative expression is important to living fully and being successful in the world. It’s extremely important for students to engage in this kind of activity. Through art, an individual becomes a better communicator and a potentially more successful and happy individual in life.”Many professionals from around the Boston area are expected to be in attendance, providing unprecedented publicity opportunities for student artists participating in the show. Boston gallery buyers and representatives from the Institute of Contemporary Art, for example, are among the show’s prestigious invites.Kathleen E. Breeden ’09, head of the selection committee and a landscape painter, is excited about the professional nature of the show and the opportunity that it presents to Harvard artists. When asked about the selection criteria, Breeden said, “We’re going to be looking at the quality of the work and its size but also its sell-ability.” She later stressed that, ultimately, there will be no stringent formula. Breeden herself plans to submit to the show; however, she is quick to laughingly affirm that she will not be on the committee who decides the fate of her pieces.  Students will be able to submit work through March 30, the first day back after spring break. Wang and Spies-Gans hope that this deadline will allow artists to collect pieces from their homes over the break to submit to the show. The show is unconventional in that all of the profits of each work will go to the respective artist; the show’s organizers will not collect commissions off the sales. The selection committee, however, will specifically chose 20 pieces for a silent auction and 20 percent of their profits will go to maintaining the show in the years to come.Though clichéd college posters will continue to stake their territory on student walls, these glossy sheets may now have to share that turf with original student paintings. If the Harvard Student Art Show proves successful in its first run, perhaps in time stock photos may find themselves outnumbered by idiosyncratic paintings and brushstrokes created by their Harvard peers.

A recent study conducted at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute may shed light on genetic risk factors for developing cancers. 
The newly published results, from a team of scientists featuring Medical School instructor Brian M. Wolpin and associate professor Charles S. Fuchs, identifies a link between pancreatic cancer and the ‘ABO gene’ that defines blood type.
Published on Mar. 10 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the study aimed to confirm data in decades-old literature that examined the relationship between blood type and a variety of cancers. 
“[The prior studies] were limited retrospective case studies leading many investigators to conclude that blood type was a risk factor,” Fuchs said. “Although it remained in the knowledge base of medicine, I don’t think people necessarily believed it.” 
Human blood groups—O, A, AB, and B—are defined by specific proteins expressed on the surface of red blood cells. Fuchs and his team narrowed in on pancreatic cancer as a means to reevaluate the connection between these blood types and cancerous tumors. 
Using O blood as a basis for comparison, the researchers found 
successively higher risks of pancreatic cancer in A, AB, and B blood types. 
The link may have to do with differences in the way specific blood types mount inflammatory responses, which can have a hand in the formation of cancers, Fuchs said. 
Because blood type is genetically pre-determined, the finding suggests that the formation of cancer may hinge on more than one’s habits. 
The possibility of genetic risk factors for pancreatic cancers has motivated the scientists to pursue future studies related to specific genes. 
“We would like to expand the [test subjects] into a much larger number and confirm that these results are really true,” Wolpin said. “If we could do that then we could delve into whether it is the exact ABO gene or a nearby gene.” 
Future studies may indicate the exact predisposing genetic risk factor for pancreatic cancer, Wolpin said.For recent research, faculty profiles, and a look at the issues facing Harvard scientists, check out The Crimson's science page.

Mandatory Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) tests for commercial truck drivers could reduce the risk of truck crashes that kill and injure thousands a year, according to a recent study by Harvard researchers.
OSA causes excessive daytime sleepiness and irregular nighttime breathing. Because of its role in increasing drowsiness, the disorder—which is expected to affect approximately 2.4 to 3.9 million licensed commercial drivers in the United States, according to a Harvard press release—can increase the risk of vehicular accident.
The OSA study, published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, recommends steps to address the problem. 
The medical review board of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has suggested that they make sleep apnea screening mandatory for regular truck drivers, said Stephen N. Kales, the study’s senior author and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.
Because commercial truck drivers must be medically certified at least every two years, OSA tests could be conducted as part of those routine examinations, Kales said.
Currently, compliance with receiving treatment for OSA is low, he said.
“Drivers have an obvious motivation to keep their jobs, especially in this economy,” said Kales. “They are not going to admit when they have a serious condition.”
“The Administration needs to make sure that if drivers have the condition, they don’t go down the street to another doctor who does not check for sleep apnea,” Kales added.
The study examined 456 commercial drivers over a 15-month period. Of the 20 who were both confirmed with OSA and participated in a sleep study, only one complied with treatment. suggesting that OSA-stricken truck drivers tend to avoid taking measures to treat their illnesses.  
“It is very easy for people with medical conditions to get these [truck driving certification] cards, even though this has serious implications,” he said.
Sleep apnea has been linked to obesity, which can encourage fat deposits to collect around the throat, making the airway more susceptible to collapse,  said Atul Malhotra, the medical director of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Sleep Disorders Program. 
Future studies will examine the effects of both sleep apnea and obesity in different professions.
“We are looking at the implications of obesity and sleep apnea in fire fighting,” said Kales.
In addition to testing for OSA, most doctors agree that “education about symptoms of sleep apnea and the risks of driving while tired are very important,” said Malhotra.

A neighbor’s advice may be more informative than your own best guess in predicting what will make you happy.A team of Harvard researchers, led by Professor of Psychology Daniel T. Gilbert, conducted two experiments in which Harvard undergraduates were asked to predict their reaction to events given either information about the event itself or surrogate information about the experience of another undergraduate who had experienced the event.
Gilbert said that the study revealed the surprising finding that an individual’s forecasting ability is improved when they are deprived of the information they really want—details of the event itself.
“It’s natural to want information about the event, but it’s not the best way to be accurate,” Gilbert said. “Our imagination is a very poor guide to how we’ll feel in the future.”
The study stated that people often misjudge their reactions because they tend to imagine features of a situation that are sure to happen, but not those that are simply likely to happen. 
By relying only on the reactions of another who have experienced the event, individuals are immune to many errors of inaccurate mental simulation, the study said. 
In an experimental setup involving speed dating, 33 undergraduate females were asked to predict how much they would enjoy a 5-minute date with a undergraduate male. Half of the group was given the man’s pictures and profiles, while others only the reaction of the women who had just “dated” the man.
The study, published in the Mar. 20 issue of the journal Science, found that the women made significantly more accurate predictions of their own level of enjoyment when provided with the experience of another woman in their social group. 
Likewise, undergraduates made more accurate predictions about how they would react to being evaluated by a member of their social group when they knew how another person had felt about a similar characterization.
Though people may benefit from the advice and experience of others, the study also found that people do not believe this to be the case. 
“People don’t like using others’ experiences,” Gilbert said. “In our study, we forced them to use it. But what in real life, what kind of things might you use to make them want to learn the things that they know?”

Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have discovered a new diagnostic test for a severe heart condition that now often goes undetected before causing sudden death.
Before the study, scientists had not been able to formulate an effective way to identify the disease, known as Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), until it progressed to deadly stages. 
“This is a disease, more than any other we know of, where the risk of dying suddenly is the greatest,” said Jeffrey E. Saffitz, one of the authors and a professor of pathology at the Medical School.
Often the first and only manifestation of the disease is when an individual “drops dead,” only to be diagnosed with ARVC at the autopsy, Saffitz said.
Since the disease runs in families, the test will likely serve shocked relatives wanting to know whether they are also at risk.
Previous diagnostic tests relied on characteristic changes that occur when the disease is already far advanced, at which point the patients are near death or require a heart transplant, Saffitz said.
The new diagnostic test consists of obtaining a sample of tissue from a heart biopsy and then looking for a specific protein that the researchers found exists in smaller quantities in patients with ARVC, said Angeliki Asimaki, the study’s lead author and a research fellow at the Medical School.
Most of the mutations that cause ARVC are in genes encoding components of a type of cell junctions called “desmosomes,” which are particularly abundant in tissues that experience great mechanical force, such as the heart.
The Beth Israel researchers showed that one desmosomal protein—plakoglobin—turned up in lower quantities in the tissues of ARCV patients.
“We then needed to know whether this result was confined to our samples, if it is specific for this disease, and then if it can be used for diagnosis,” Asimaki said.
The researchers found that every sample from a patient with ARVC had less plakoglobin and that in other types of heart disease plakoglobin was normal.
“It appears that this diagnostic approach is specific and sensitive,” Asimaki said. “It also appears that this test will show us the protein is expressed even when the disease has progressed very little.”
Although the test will involve a heart biopsy, the researchers believe that cardiologists and patients will be more willing to undergo the procedure if they believe a clear-cut diagnosis can be made, said Saffitz.
“We are hoping it may lead not only to diagnosis of ARVC but also treatment in the near future,” said Shiva P. Gautam, one of the authors and an associate professor at the Medical School.

Former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and erstwhile presidential candidate Howard Dean discussed President Obama, healthcare, and the “50-state strategy” at the Institute of Politics forum last night, before heading to Kirkland House to receive the Harvard College Democrats Leader of the Year award. Dean spoke before a packed audience at the forum, where he focused on the recent evolution in campaigning methods and the ways in which a changing ethos among Americans led to the election of the nation’s first African-American president.“It’s a milestone election,” Dean said. “The most important thing Obama’s election means to us, I think, is not just [his race] but that this is a new paradigm shift in who runs America.” Dean also discussed the power of the Internet in grassroots campaign movements, as well as the importance of using a “50-state strategy,” in which Democrats compete for votes in traditionally Republican states. Dean spent most of his time responding to questions from the highly responsive forum audience. He received thunderous applause when he called for universal health insurance. “A system of health care reform without a public option is not health care reform,” Dean said. Responding to a question about the political impact of the Hispanic community, Dean criticized Republicans for their stance on Latinos.“In the halls of Congress, the Republicans are pushing the fence against people whose names end with e, z, or another vowel,” he said. After the forum, Dean headed to the Kirkland Junior Common Room for the College Democrats event. Following an introduction by Events Coordinator Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, Dean spoke briefly before settling down for an informal, off-the-record discussion with the roughly 100 students in attendance. Students asked questions dealing with everything from the debate over gay rights to the future of the Democratic party, now that it controls both the presidency and congress. As the event concluded, Berkenfeld presented Dean with a Harvard College Democrats t-shirt, which Dean promptly donned. After the event, Dean said he valued informal discussions about politics because of their power to motivate young people.“The whole generation is more thoughtful and tolerant than we were,” he said. “They’re center-left, and I think that’s the future of this country as long as we don’t screw it up.”Dems President Eva Z. Lam ’10 said she was thrilled with the response to the event. “As a student, it’s a big leap for a lot of us to think of ourselves as participants in politics as opposed to observers,” she said. “This really helps break down the barriers.”Dean was initially invited to Harvard by the Dems, but his friendship with IOP fellow Tina Flournoy led him to include an afternoon visit to her study group. He scheduled the IOP forum event soon thereafter.—Staff writer Evan T. R. Rosenman can be reached at erosenm@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the U.S. economy continues to struggle through its worst crisis in decades, Harvard researchers dependent on private funds are feeling the pinch.
Last month, a private disease foundation told Adrian J. Ivinson, director of the NeuroDiscovery Center at Harvard Medical School, that it could no longer fund his grant through its current funding plan—asking to break up the payments into four or five installments, instead of two.
Ivinson, who conducts research on neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s, says his center draws 60 percent of its funding from private donors—causing unease about support for future projects.
Several foundations have told Ivinson that they will no longer accept grant applications. And some donors who have supported him repeatedly say they cannot afford to fund in the future.
“We have good and honest conversations about their plans for the coming months,” he says.
Such grim financial projections abound at Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals where much of its faculty work. Mass. General, Dana-Farber, and Beth Israel Deaconess have all announced plans for layoffs. And the Medical School recently said it would cut its budget by 10 percent for the next fiscal year due to a projected 30 percent decline in Harvard’s endowment for the year ending this June 30.
Amid this unease, some see the recently passed federal stimulus package as a much-needed silver lining, promising to pump billions of dollars into scientific research.
And others worry that this temporary federal windfall may be unable to alleviate the crunch, leaving the fate of their long-term funding in limbo.
UNCERTAIN TERMS
The dicey financial climate has led many researchers at the Medical School and its affiliates to scramble for new funding options.
Joan S. Brugge, chair of the Department of Cell Biology, said she knows of four people in her department who had grants from private foundations that have gone under.
“All funding was cut off immediately,” she said, and next year’s funding remains unclear.
But even the $10 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health in President Obama’s one-time stimulus package could do little to change this uncertainty over the long-run, researchers said.
Though Brugge said the stimulus package has been a huge morale boost for researchers, she added that there is confusion about certain stipulations in the bill, specifically why the NIH funding requires projects to be completed within two years.
“Will we just reengage people and put off the bad news for the cessation in funding?” she asked.
Isaac S. Kohane, the director of the Children’s Hospital Informatics Program, agreeD that though the increase in funding is very much appreciated, it does not solve a structural revenue problem. He said that the overhead from this funding would at best serve as a band-aid for the next two years. 
“It is not something the Medical School and University can build its future on,” Kohane said.
ANTE UP
Brugge said that even though the stimulus means more funding, its temporary nature complicates allocation.
“We don’t want to create a worse situation in two years when the funding is up,” she said.
Brugge said she was also concerned about junior members who have the least job protection, and that stimulus funding should be directed toward vulnerable postdocs.
“Many of the lab directors are not anticipating funding [the postdocs] after next summer because they won’t have jobs,” she said. “Those are the ones we are most worried about.” 
Kohane agreed that the additional funding should go to young researchers, whose positions are the most vulnerable. 
“It we do short-term hiring, we will face a really problematic gap in the pipeline of young faculty rising up the ranks. I would like to see the monies if possible focused on that group more than any other,” Kohane said.
Other administrators are focusing more on what projects to fund rather than who will get the money.
Ivinson said that he has held meetings with his investigators to come up with a strategy to apply for the new funding.  He said that he and his colleagues have worked to identify “shovel-ready projects” that could be started immediately.  
He pointed to a new mouse behavior lab facility at the Center as an example of a project that can be completed in two years—according to Ivinson, 75 percent of the funding is already in place. 
A GROWING URGENCY
Ivinson said that part of his fundraising pitch is to say that despite the economic downturn, he needs donors’ help now more than ever.
“If not you, then who?” he asks, adding that as donors contemplate cutting back, his Center cannot just agree to slow down its research over the next few months and years.
“This is a challenge, and we can respond to the challenge by being upbeat,” Ivinson said. “We know it will be tough, but any day that we don’t make progress in the disease we are treating, the urgency grows. We are not going to back off.” 
But even Director of the Center for Genomic Medicine Scott T. Weiss—who said he has been continuously funded by the NIH for 30 years and works in a field often prioritized for funding—said that grant money is always uncertain.
“Everyone applies for a lot of grants and you keep applying and hope that one or another of these will get funded,” he said.

When Anneika M. Verghese ’12 opened her door at 9 a.m. yesterday, she said she was more confused than surprised. The loud revelry of Leverett and Mather House undergraduates welcoming new residents on the floor below had already prepared her and her blockmates for what to expect. Instead, upon opening their door, they found a giant elephant mascot sitting in the Wigglesworth entryway.   “I was, like, the Republicans? Really?” Verghese said. But it was a non-partisan elephant—the Eliot House mascot—that greeted Verghese and 144 other freshmen assigned to Eliot. Before most classes began yesterday morning, first-years received letters informing them which of the 12 upperclassmen Houses they will reside in over the next three years. This year marked the second time undergraduates, rather than College administrators, delivered residential assignments to freshmen. “Republicans or Eliot—either way, I would’ve been happy,” said Verghese, one of two Republicans in the three-person blocking group. As early as 8 a.m., herds of upperclassmen began invading the Yard, brandishing signs with House slogans, shouting competitive chants, and donning quirky House t-shirts. Despite the festivities—which started late last night with a River Run that got out of hand—and the procession of a menagerie of House mascots that would later meet them outside Annenberg Hall, not all freshmen were excited to see certain House delegations at their doors. “Immediately, we were silent. A few of us started tearing up,” said Jennah R. A. Hiari ’12, referring to how she and her blocking group took the news that they’d been assigned to Pforzheimer House. But upperclassmen tried to alleviate freshmen’s disappointment, she added. “A guy walked up to me and whispered, ‘I know, I know. But eventually, you’ll love [Pfoho],’” Hiari said. Before noon, Annenberg was already the center of celebration. Outside in the chilly drizzle, students jumped on a multicolored moonbounce on the lawn. And inside the freshman dining hall, a student riding a unicycle weaved around the crowded tables, as freshmen broke off into exclusive House groups, some exchanging hugs with their future neighbors. Danielle M. Gram ’11, who delivered Housing assignments for Currier House along with barely-clothed Currier residents, said the raucousness reached dangerously high levels. “We were all shouting, ‘I’m from C-House,’ and everyone was so excited. One freshman almost had a heart attack,” said Gram, noting the rowdiness of some students. “But most freshmen were so excited by our nakedness, [that] they took off their clothes.” —Staff writer Edward Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Ahmed N.

Wednesday night’s “River Run” came to an abrupt halt when the Cambridge Fire Department arrived on the scene in response to a call about a possible fire at the Weld Boathouse. Members of the Harvard University Police Department as well as officers of the Cambridge and Massachusetts State Police forces, accompanied the fire-fighters, spreading out along a stretch of the Charles River between Eliot and Mather Houses to ward away undergraduates from the river’s bank. The alleged cause of the disruption was the recent pre-Housing Day tradition of launching lit cardboard boats bearing the names of desired Houses into the Charles. Embarkations began around 10:30 p.m., with many freshmen blocking groups arriving at the water’s edge hauling elaborate, multi-tiered creations. But as the night progressed, groups began to douse their boats with flammable liquids—nail polish remover and Axe Body Spray proved popular choices—eventually drawing firefighters’ attention to what has for years been an innocent, if pyromanic, tradition. “There’s people who sleep along the river,” said Nicole Zedlais, a firewoman who responded to the approximately 11:30 p.m. call. Zedlais also said the riverbank had grown dangerously dry from the lack of rain, which she said prompted a particularly urgent response when the local emergency dispatcher relayed a call that “the rear of the boathouse was on fire.” In her six years on the force, Zedlais said she had never even heard of the “River Run,” her unfamiliarity further evidencing that last night’s spectacle was out-of-the-ordinary. When the Harvard police did arrive, at roughly the same time as the Cambridge Fire Department, the two departments quickly shut down the river’s perimeter, stationing officers on either end of Weeks footbridge. According to several student accounts, HUPD acted to shield wayward freshmen, encouraging students to move on so as to avoid any altercation with city and state officers. Margaret E. Soutter ’12, whose blocking group was walking along the river at the time, said that Cambridge police were taking the tougher line, threatening, “‘If you don’t back away from the river in 30 seconds, we’re gonna lock you up.’” Neither the Cambridge Police Department nor HUPD returned requests for comment yesterday. Some freshmen sought to avoid the fracas by moving several hundred yards downstream, but were confronted by a different contingent of officers. “We went all the way down to the other end of the river and doused our boat in nail polish remover,” said Kelsey A. Koff ’12. When Cambridge police arrived, Koff said, “They talked to us in a really condescending way,” saying that an arrest would lead to expulsion and that “‘Mommy and Daddy will be pissed.’” Still, some upperclassmen found time to relish the evening. Rachel E. Flynn ’09 and Barry A. Shafrin ’09 found themselves in the thick of the revelry Wednesday night and decided to set fire to a miniature paper boat in a puddle outside of Winthrop House. “The po-po shut down the real river,” Flynn said. “This isn’t for our House,” Shafrin added, laughing. “This is for our careers.” —Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Ahmed N.

Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan was confirmed as the nation’s first female Solicitor General yesterday after the United States Senate voted 61-31 in favor of her nomination.Kagan’s nomination as Solicitor General, the federal government’s representative before the Supreme Court, was initially met with enthusiasm by Senators on both sides of the political aisle, but yesterday’s vote brought unexpected Republican opposition.Much of Kagan’s bi-partisan support evaporated in recent months after a spat with Sen. Arlen Specter over her unwillingness to answer several questions from the Pennsylvania Republican about her legal views.During debate on the Senate floor yesterday, Republican Senators criticized Kagan as a result.“I think we have to pay a little more attention, and I’ve gone to some length to try to find out more about Dean Kagan.  But in the absence of being able to do so and really have a judgment on her qualifications, I’m constrained to vote no,” Specter said during the debate.Kagan received additional criticism over her opposition to the Solomon Amendment, a measure allowing military recruiters on college campuses, and lack of appelate court experience. 	But it was Kagan’s unwillingness to answer questions posed by Specter, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, that caused support for her nomination to wither among Republicans.Kagan garnered just eight Republican votes in support of her nomination.In a letter to Kagan after her confirmation hearing, Specter asked the Harvard Dean to elaborate on her responses to written questions. But Kagan declined, arguing that the Solicitor General would be unwise to explain personal opinions before assuming an office charged with representing the United States government.Professor Charles Fried, a prominent conservative at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor General under President Reagan, dismissed the criticism by some Republican Senators as political posturing that followed a long line of right-wing opposition to the Obama administration’s nominations and characterized their disapproval as “a pretext from the beginning to the end.”“She was at least as forthcoming as anybody, and she was as forthcoming as she ought to be,” Fried said.Fried and other former Solicitor Generals submitted a joint letter to the Judiciary Committee endorsing Kagan’s nomination.Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, lambasted Kagan for opposing the Solomon Amendment and challenged her integrity.“The Solicitor General should have a record of following the law, not flouting it,” Sessions said in reference to her opposition to allowing military recruiters on campus.—Staff writer Elias J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two years after the University approved a calendar change that introduced a “January Term,” or “J-Term,” the College has yet to adopt concrete plans for next January, raising questions and concerns from the student body about programming and housing during this three-week-long period between first and second semesters.  
The period, dubbed the “January Experience” to distinguish it from an academic term, will last from Jan. 3 to Jan. 23 of next year.
Though College officials say plans are forthcoming, students and student groups, such as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals—which President David J. Andersson ’09 said needs January housing to prepare for their spring play—have been left in the dark as to what they might be able to do next year.
“It’s great that Harvard is making a change, but they sort of seem unprepared for this,” Andersson said.
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
In September 2003, then-President Lawrence H. Summers, Provost Steven E. Hyman, and University deans announced their desire to reevaluate the University’s calendars. A committee chaired by Professor Sidney Verba ’53 was formed to spearhead the effort.
After six months of consideration, the committee suggested a new University-wide calendar, consisting of two four-month semesters separated by a one-month break. 
But amid a focus on the pending curricular review and the controversies of the Summers administration, calendar reform fell by the wayside. In spring 2007, Undergraduate Council resumed the discussion, calling for an undergraduate referendum on calendar reform­ and proposing a plan that deviated from the Verba report in omitting a J-Term. 
At the end of that academic year, interim President Derek C. Bok announced that the Harvard Corporation had approved a plan modeled on the Verba committee’s initial outline.
Bok wrote in his announcement that plans for the time between early January and the start of spring term would be left to the discretion of individual schools—leaving room for decisions that have yet to be made. 
LIVING EXPERIENCE
From the discussion’s outset, the administration made clear that unlike at other schools with J-Terms—such as MIT and Oberlin—Harvard’s January session will be completely optional. 
But the opportunities available to those who do not wish to spend five weeks at home are far from set in stone. 
Assistant Dean in the Advising Programs Office Inge-Lise Ameer was recently selected to lead planning for next January. 
In an interview earlier this year, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that she envisioned that January programs would either allow students to explore interests they could not during normal academic terms or help them build non-academic skills. Hammonds said the College aims to announce plans for the period by the end of the academic year.

David B. Arnold ’71, whose latest photo exhibit is designed to serve as an eye opener to the serious effects of global warming on some of the world’s most remote mountains and glaciers, spoke last night to a small group of students about his observations. The talk—co-hosted by the Harvard Mountaineering Club and the Environmental Action Committee—centered on the new exhibit, which compares pictures taken by Arnold recently to pictures taken in the mid-20th century by former Mountaineering Club president and renowned photographer H. Bradford Washburn, Jr. ’33.Kevin F. Jones ’09, the current president of the mountaineering club, said that the idea to host Arnold came from club member Eliza A. Lehner ’11, who wrote a paper on his exhibition for a class. Karen A. McKinnon ’10, the EAC president, said that they immediately agreed to co-host the event. “Such visuals usually have a great impact on those who are outdoors-y and love the environment,” she said.Arnold, Harvard’s first Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, started his career as a newspaper reporter. He said the inspiration for this project came from seeing one of Washburn’s pictures, which led him to wonder if things had changed since Washburn first took those shots.He discovered that they had. “I didn’t set out as an environmentalist. Brad [Washburn] didn’t think that I would see any change,” Arnold said. “But, I came out a very different and scared person, scared for what we’re doing. My biggest hurdle now is to not scare people to death.”Arnold’s pictures are taken at the same time of year as those taken by Washburn, to emphasize the differences between them. One of the first pictures in Arnold’s presentation was of the Nunatak Glacier, 11,000 feet above sea level, a height at which Arnold said most scientists didn’t expect to see the effect of climate change. The glacier has now almost completely melted.“My expectation from this exhibition is that wherever it goes, fewer and fewer people will doubt the extent to which we are changing the world,” Arnold said. Lehner said she was very happy with the turnout, adding that “there was a greater focus in his presentation on activism as compared to the exhibit.”Arnold said he wants his next project to be on corals and how they have diminished due to the increasing acidity of ocean water. “Americans need the greatest change in lifestyle, so there is an incentive to not believe that global warming is a consequence of human actions,” he said. “But we should realize that we can and must slow this down.”

Sixteen courses—only one of which was newly created—were approved for Gen Ed credit at the beginning of this month.Jason A. Ur, one of the professors teaching the recently approved Anthropology 1010: “Introduction to Archaeology,” said he was thrilled by the decision because the course previously only counted only for departmental credit. “Harvard students don’t like to waste time,” Ur said. “Now they can take something interesting which is also a requirement and this will hopefully interest more students in archaeology.”For Ur, the transition to Gen Ed meant shifting the emphasis of the course, which is offered in the anthropology department and will now count for the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning category. While Ur adapted his course in the process of gaining Gen Ed approval, Anne Marie E. Calareso, program manager for General Education, said that the Gen Ed committee doesn’t really turn any courses away.“In the case where a course wouldn’t necessarily fit, we might talk with the faculty member about how to make it fit,” said Calareso who added that this might include more integrative web sites or museum visits.But Calareso noted that any changes to previously existing courses in their transition to Gen Ed come primarily from the faculty.“The [Gen Ed] committee isn’t in the business of telling faculty what to do,” Calareso said. She added that while this is the case,  professors have to be explicit in their proposals about how their course fits within the Gen Ed philosophy.Scot T. Martin, who teaches the recently approved Engineering Sciences 6, said that the Gen Ed aim “to make courses socially relevant” was something his course has tried to do from the beginning.Martin added that his course will change next year, but not because of Gen Ed. He said that it is the nature of the course, which deals with energy production and pollution issues, to always be adapting.This recent set of class approvals has allowed professors of departmental courses to seek bigger and more diverse student audiences and Core class professors to continue with their carefully cultivated courses, and Calareso said she is unsure how many future Gen Ed proposals will be entirely new. “We certainly would like new courses but recognize that it could be difficult to do within the short time frame,” Calareso said.She added that the committee should soon be seeing proposals coming out of graduate seminars, which were designed to develop courses for the General Education program. —Staff writer Rachel A.

Approximately 200 counter-protestors from Harvard and the local community gathered on Mass. Ave on the day most students were departing for spring break to demonstrate against the Westboro Baptist Church—one week after a similar protest at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.
Five members of the Kansas-based church, whose nationwide picketing activities against homosexuality have earned them a “hate group” designation from southern non-profit legal authorities, demonstrated in an area flanked by Cambridge Police, who maintained a perimeter guard during the entirety of the protest. Although the group had planned to picket near Lamont Library, they announced the day before the protest that the location would be changed to Harvard Law School.Shirley Phelps-Roper, who was carrying a sign that read “Bloody Obama,” said the Church was picketing at HLS specifically to protest the new president.“This is the place that spawned the anti-Christ Barack Obama,” she said. “This is the place where the leaders of America are taught doomed rebellion.”The distance—about ten feet—between the opposing groups was smaller than it was at the previous week’s protest at Cambridge’s only public high school. The shorter divide allowed some of the counter-protesters to respond directly to church members.“Having a face-to-face conversation with Shirley Phelps[-Roper] really gets your blood going,” said James D. Hills ’11, who stood near the front of the crowd, wearing an American flag as a cape.Among the counter-protesters were members of the Harvard Glee Club, who led the group in a rendition of “This Land is Your Land.” The Westboro protesters answered with their own version of the song, which replaced the lyric “This land was made for you and me” with “This land is headed straight to Hell.”The counter-protest, which was organized by the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard College Queer Student and Allies, included a Phelps-a-thon fundraiser—named after Westboro leader Fred Phelps—which raised over $1000 for Cambridge Cares About AIDS.The counter-protesters also made a “wall of love”—a sheet decorated with signatures and positive messages—to be displayed in the College’s BGLTSA Resource Center.QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 said he was glad that there was much diversity among the counter-protesters.“You don’t have to be GLBTQ to say that homophobia is unacceptable,” Chan said.Most counter-protesters who had also participated in the earlier protest said they believed the second demonstration had been more positive.“This one felt more like a celebration to me, which is ultimately what it should be,” said Eva Z. Lam ’10, president of the Harvard Democrats. “If you see them more than once you realize they’re not really that interesting. They’re just four or five crazy people with signs, some of which don’t even make sense.”—Staff writer Sofia E. Groopman can be reached at segroopm@fas.harvard.edu

The Harvard baseball team looks to rebound from a four-game sweep last weekend at the University of Alabama-Birmingham with yet another southern tour—this time through Louisiana. The Crimson (1-7) will hope to solidify its pitching rotation and get the bats moving more consistently over the next week before opening Ivy League play the following weekend.“We’re hoping to be a little more consistent and play some complete games,” senior Tom Stack-Babich said. “We’ve played well in parts of each game, but we really need to put the hitting together in order to get some good games down south.”  Harvard will open a three-game series today against Centenary College (9-3) and then stop by Monday at the University of Louisiana-Monroe (10-8). Following two night games at No. 5 Louisiana State University (15-4), the Crimson will wrap up its trip at the University of New Orleans (5-12). After playing seven games in as many days, Harvard will only have one day of rest before kicking off conference play with consecutive doubleheaders at Columbia (1-12) and at Penn (7-5) next weekend.  Although he acknowledged that traveling to four different schools over this trip will be tough, Crimson coach Joe Walsh said he believed that taking a more simple approach will prevent his team from being overwhelmed by the challenges ahead. “If we try to look ahead at the duration of the trip and take that attitude we won’t play well,” Walsh said. “We need to go down there and just look at our next opponent, and we need to win some ballgames to get some good feelings around the clubhouse. That’s all everyone is thinking—we’re down here to win games.”  After a disappointing 2008 season, and a slow start this year, this Spring Break trip and the opening of Ivy League play could very well set a defining tone for the rest of the season. But the Crimson will not have an easy start to its seven-game southern stretch, with a Centenary squad up first that is currently riding a six-game winning streak during which it has outscored its opponents 64-14. While Centenary presents a difficult opening slate for Harvard, the team’s biggest challenge comes against defending SEC champion LSU. The fifth-ranked Tigers feature a stacked lineup anchored by slugger Sean Ochinko, who is batting .464 with six home runs and 27 RBI in just 19 games.“We’re definitely going to play some good teams,” Stack-Babich said. “I don’t think we’re looking to go undefeated, but we hope that we are able to get the pitching shored up and get the hitting in sync.” The state of Harvard’s pitching staff is certainly a cause for concern for the team. The Crimson has had great outings from sophomore Dan Berardo and freshmen Conner Hulse and Brent Suter, but the rotation has been dealt a huge blow by the loss of sophomore ace Max Perlman. Perlman will not travel south with the team and will instead visit well-known sports surgeon Dr. James Andrews to have his injured elbow examined. “Losing Max at the top of our rotation is a major loss,” Walsh said. “We’re hoping that that the MRI that will be read by Dr. Andrews results in something that will get him back to us, but at this point it unfortunately looks pretty serious. Even so, our rotation is shaping up really nicely with Berardo, Hulse, and Suter, but we’ll spend time on this trip still looking for that fourth guy who can wrap up the rotation as well as a closer. Hopefully by about the middle of the week we’ll think of saving some of our stronger pitching for the Ivy games.” Playing teams already in midseason form will be a challenge for the Crimson, but will also give the team a taste of how competitive the Ivy League season will be.  Still, Harvard realizes the need to conserve its energy for its pair of doubleheaders against Columbia and Penn.  “We are definitely excited about playing these teams and hopefully getting some good wins in, but we still want to make sure we get a good start against the Ivy League teams,” Stack-Babich said.  Walsh echoed the need for the Crimson to stay alert and organized throughout the trip, especially with a number of players battling through illness. “The big thing on my mind is definitely keeping the guys fresh going into this trip with the length of travel we’re going to have, but we are struggling with this virus that has been hitting our team lately,” Walsh said. “We’re definitely going to focus on structure this week, and I know that once everybody gets out on the mound we will be ready.”

Unlike most students on campus, players on the Harvard men’s lacrosse team are not anxiously awaiting some rest and relaxation on the warm sand over spring recess. Try metal, sweat, and churned up grass. While the team will be flying south to warmer climates and staying in hotels like most of America’s college population, there will be no tanning oils or beach balls in sight—only rubber balls. Tomorrow, the Crimson (3-1, 0-0 Ivy) faces rival Penn (1-3, 0-1), an offensive powerhouse that defeated Harvard 12-10 last season. The Crimson heads to Washington D.C. to face Georgetown on Wednesday and flocks further southward next Friday to butt heads with Presbyterian in sunny Atlanta. Harvard has played neither the Hoyas nor the Blue Hose, since before members of the squads were in high school. While the Crimson is shooting for wins on the road trip, its eyes are wide with vengeance as it focuses on the Quakers. “To be honest, we really haven’t looked past Saturday,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “We are focusing on Penn. [The loss] was a tough way to start spring break [last year].”Crimson junior midfielder Jason Duboe, who led the team with 26 goals last season, insists that Harvard must stick to its inclusive, collaborative style in order to beat the Quakers. “We’re going to focus on being as selfless as possible and distributing the ball,” Duboe said. “Continuing to do what we do. The pressure isn’t on any one guy. If we move the ball enough, everyone’s going to get a look.”The Crimson players have matured since a season ago, and it shows. In addition to successful practices all week, the playershave been doing their due diligence on tomorrow’s matchup. “Watching the film from last year, any player could tell some of the mistakes we made,” co-captain midfielder Nick Smith said. This kind of thorough preparation brought Harvard its impressive season-opening upset win against Duke on February 22nd, when the Crimson traveled to Durham and earned a commanding 9-6 victory over the Blue Devils. Harvard is hopeful that this win is indicative of growth, setting the tone for the games remaining. “It seems a long time ago at this point, but it’s definitely something that we can look back on as we’re preparing for other teams in view,” Smith said. The Crimson’s veterans will be key to continued success. “We’ll find out how good we are in the next few weeks,” Tillman said. “But regardless of how things work out this season, our senior leadership has been great this year. We’ve asked for more and they’ve responded well.” While Harvard has prolific scorers in Duboe, freshman attackman Jeff Cohen, sophomore attackman Dean Gibbons, and junior attackman/midfielder Travis Burr, among others, the Crimson is equally confident in the ability of its experienced players to protect the goal. “With three of our team captains playing on that end of the field, it certainly helps to have a lot of leadership down there,” Duboe said.As for Georgetown and Presbyterian, Harvard plans to stick to the script. Given that they have no past games against either team to analyze, the Crimson must focus on familiarizing itself with the opponents’ strengths and sticking to its own recipe for success. “We’ll break down film like we break down any team, and play our own game,” Duboe said. While a win against Penn would be a great way to start off spring break, Harvard is optimistic about this season regardless of the outcome. “We’re excited about the attitude the kids have,” Tillman said. “We can beat anyone,” Smith said. “But at the same time, we have to remember that we put our pants on one leg at a time like everyone else. Going into spring break, it’s about preparation.”

It just doesn’t quite match up. Last season, the Harvard women’s basketball team was one of three co-champions of the Ivy League, but missed out on postseason tournament play when it fell to Dartmouth in a league playoff. Fast forward a year later, and the Crimson has fallen short of its third straight Ancient Eight crown after a crushing 64-51 loss to the Big Green last Tuesday in Hanover. But somehow, its season continues—Harvard (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) will face St. John’s (17-14, 4-12 Big East) in the first round of the postseason National Invitational Tournament (NIT) tonight in Queens, N.Y. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. How does Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith figure? “It’s different,” she said. “The Ivy title is so important to us, and we had to get over that disappointment. But they’re over that. Once they realized that the NIT is a tremendous national tournament, we got very excited about it. We’ve moved on and reprioritized.” After the Dartmouth loss, the team took a few days off from practice to leave its frustration behind. Since then, it’s had a week of intense, competitive practices. “We’re competing and working hard now to win a different championship, the NIT,” senior forward Katie Rollins said. “We’re bringing the same high standard.” With the Ivy League in the rearview mirror, the Crimson is now wondering how it will match up against the mysterious Red Storm. Before beginning league play, St. John’s won 13 of its first 14 games and appeared ready to make a statement on the national stage. But competition in the powerhouse Big East conference caught up to the Red Storm, which struggled to a 4-12 league mark. Most recently, St. John’s beat Syracuse in its first-round game in the postseason Big East tournament, but fell in the next round to Notre Dame—now a seven-seed in the NCAA tournament. The Red Storm’s 35-point win over Dartmouth—albeit in November—can give the Crimson one idea of how tonight’s matchup might go. But the Crimson’s own strong non-conference play, which included wins over U.C. Santa Barbara (an NCAA Tournament team) and Central Connecticut State and Vermont (both NIT teams), has the team believing that it can make a game of it in Queens. “It’s going to be interesting to see how St. John’s views us,” Delaney-Smith said. “I wonder if they are looking past us. It’d be interesting to be a fly on their locker room wall.” The Red Storm will greet its host from Cambridge with a fast-paced, transition-oriented attack. The squad uses a stifling press to force and convert off of turnovers. It boasts three scorers in double figures, led by senior guard Monique McLean and her 17.3 points per game. Freshman forward Da’Shena Stevens, the Big East Rookie of the Year, checks in with 11.7 points and a team-leading 6.5 rebounds—she’ll have the attention of the Crimson’s frontcourt corps. Those Harvard forwards—Rollins and sophomores Emma Markley and Jackie Alemany—will have something to prove after being severely outmuscled in last week’s Dartmouth loss. Play in the post was all Big Green, which ended the game with a 51-27 advantage on the glass (including 20 offensive rebounds). “St. John’s is, man-for-man, quicker than us and more athletic than us,” Rollins said. “It’s going to take a team of five on the court and a full one-through-10 to beat them.” While frontcourt play was one difference-maker in the Dartmouth loss, the Crimson will need a strong performance from its guards if it wants to hang with St. John’s. Co-captain Emily Tay—who last week was named to her third consecutive All-Ivy First Team—was all but absent last weekend in Hanover (seven points, four turnovers). Tay’s poise will be equally important as her scoring:she and backcourt mate Brogan Berry, this year’s Ivy Rookie of the Year, will have to keep turnovers low against the full and half-court pressure that the Red Storm will bring from the opening tip. Harvard has a notion to pull the upset in the first round and continue on to face Hartford in Connecticut on Sunday. But regardless of how deep it goes into the tournament, the team is grateful for the chance to play another day. “At first, it was okay for us to just be bummed,” Rollins said. “Our coaches said, ‘You have a chance to make it up. You have a chance to play with your teammates again and go on another trip.’ That’s kind of how we all looked at it.” “Our seniors have had four great years, and we want to make sure they go out on a positive note,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s great to be able to extend the season and keep going. I like the way we’re playing.” —Staff writer Emily W. Cunningham can be reached at ecunning@fas.harvard.edu.

While most Harvard students will spend their spring breaks relaxing on sandy beaches, the women of the softball team will be spending the majority of their time sweating it out on a different type of dirt. The Crimson (6-3) will play nine games in as many days, starting today with the Highlander Classic in Radford, Va., and concluding next weekend with doubleheaders at Columbia and Penn. “It’s the first time we’ve had a winning record in preseason, and our preseason has been tough,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We’re in a really good place right now, and we’re ready to start league play after this weekend. We’re excited to play Ivy teams rather than teams from these big conferences.” But before Harvard can take to the field against the Lions and the Bulldogs, the team will have to make use of this weekend’s matchups to fine tune its play. “We’re making a few adjustments at the plate,” Vertovez said. “We’re trying to execute different situations and hitters have been seeing a lot of live work. Getting close to the season, we’re just tweaking things and looking for perfection.” This stretch of matchups through spring break will come as a welcome relief to the Crimson, who has not competed for nearly two weeks. “We’re excited to play some more games,” Vertovez said. “We’ve been inside for two weeks since our last game, and we want to get as many games in before getting into Ivy play, and we’re excited to play in warm weather.” Warm climates have been kind to Harvard—most recently, the team won the Miken Classic in Boca Raton, Fla. Freshman pitcher Rachel Brown was named tournament MVP and garnered Ivy Pitcher of the Week honors for her efforts in the team’s tournament victories. The first-year struck out eight batters and ceded just one earned run in Harvard’s 3-2 win over Florida Atlantic to move to 5-0 with a 0.88 ERA on the season. “Rachel Brown has been amazing for us,” Vertovez said. “She’s been unstoppable on the mound and we love that she’s on our team. She has great energy and as a team we feed off of that. It’s great to see a freshman come in and dominate these hitters,” she added. Brown and the rest of the pitching staff will have the opportunity to see many different hitting styles when it competes in the Highlander Classic this weekend. A crucial part of Harvard’s pitching staff, along with Brown, freshmen Marika Zumbro and Julia Moore, and junior Margaux Black, will be none other than Vertovez, who threw a two-hitter in Harvard’s 1-0 loss to Central Michigan. “Our pitching staff goes so deep,” Vertovez said. “Having a deep staff—that is huge and it’s going to make us really great contenders.” When they take on Eastern Michigan today, the Crimson pitchers will be tested by Eagles infielder Stacie Skodinski, who currently leads her team in both batting average, at .449, and slugging percentage. at .816. The sophomore has also hit four home runs on the season and leads Eastern Michigan in RBI with 15. Harvard will also look to continue to develop its offense throughout tournament play. It takes on Radford—a team that has won six of its last seven games and is 12-4 on the season—in its third matchup of the tournament. Against the Highlanders, the Crimson will face sophomore pitcher Kellie Snooks, who has an 8-0 record and a 1.83 ERA. But Harvard should have plenty of offensive firepower to throw Snooks’ way. Junior Jess Pledger leads the Crimson batters with a .346 batting average and 11 RBI. She also has three game-winning hits. “Jess Pledger has been between [designated hitter] and catcher,” Vertovez said. “She comes up with these clutch hits like it’s her job. She’ll come in when we need her to to get the clutch hit.” Co-captain Hayley Bock also has a .346 batting average and leads the team in slugging percentage at .538. “I’m a leader on the field when I’m catching, and as a member of the three-four-five hitters,” Bock said. “It’s part of my job to be a consistent hitter and drive in a lot of [runs]. I’m a power hitter, so doubles, triples, and home runs should be expected.” A strong showing at the Highlander Classic could be indicative of how the Crimson’s regular season is going to go, since it is the final tournament leading up to the beginning of the Ivy season. “We’re pretty confident we can win this tournament,” Vertovez said. “We’re going to come in with this mindset so we’re going to come out and do what we’ve been doing—that means relying on our pitching and waiting for our bats to come through one through nine.” “I’m looking to open our Ivy League as strong as we have started our preseason,” Bock added. “We want to open up Ivies with a sweep.” —Staff writer Lucy D.

GAME OVER - ST JOHN'S 83, HARVARD 60. Thanks for reading The Crimson's live coverage of Harvard's NIT first round matchup with the Red Storm. Stay classy, Cambridge.19:30 - The clock is ticking down, and it looks like this is it for Harvard this season. The Crimson put together another strong campaign, finishing just short of an Ivy three-peat and getting an invitation to the NIT. Emily Tay caps off as stellar career with a jumper from the side. 81-60 and the seconds are ticking away.15:15 - Harvard's season might be coming to a close, but Emily Tay's still got style. She feeds a pretty no-look pass to Markley in the post. Markley turns around for the lay-in.14:00 - A three from St. John's Kelly McMammon kills the Harvard mojo. 71-52 St. John's. Uh...make that 73-52.13:19 - At 68-52, this one is pretty much out of reach. But Harvard has the momentum and could at least make it respectable.12:20 - Gotta give it to the Crimson - the team's not going down easy. A quick 8-0 run brings Harvard within 16. Still a stretch at this point.10:48 - Hodges missed her free throw, but decided to give the three-point play another shot. She missed this free throw too, but it's all gravy by this point for the Red Storm, which is up by 24 (66-42).10:15 - Jackie Alemany makes some nice moves to the basket for a spinning layup. But St. John's Victoria Hodges gets an and-1.9:16 - St. John's is scoring at will now. It's 62-39, Red Storm. Moretzsohn at the line for Harvard and makes 1 of 2.8:11 - Harvard mercifully takes a timeout. The Crimson is down by 19 now, 58-39, with 11:49 left in the game. It's not going to take a miracle, but it's going to have to be something pretty close for Harvard to come back.6:40 - Things are falling apart quickly for Harvard and the Red Storm is going for the jugular with the press. But Harvard breaks it and Emma Moretzsohn gets a layup. 54-39, St. John's.5:40 - Two quick layups from Markley and Tay keep things interesting.4:50 - Da'Shena Stevens is killing the Crimson. She had eight in the first half and now she has another eight in the first five minutes of the second. Britney Murphy hits a three and Harvard's down by 15.4:10 - Uh oh. A St. John's three puts Harvard down by 12. 45-33, St. John's.2:50 - Berry hits a runner to cut the lead to 38-31 but the Red Storm answers right back with a layup.2:04 - Harvard looking sluggish. Down by seven quickly.0:59 - Quick Harvard turnover and the Red Storm gets a layup soon after. 34-29 St. John's.START OF SECOND HALFIntermission: Two minutes till the second half. The St. John's paper is called The Torch. That's pretty cool.Intermission: A couple of halftime stats. Christine Matera leads all scorers with nine points, all of which came off the three-ball. St. John's Da'Shena Stevens is a beast on the boards, pulling down six so far. Both teams are at 50% from behind the arc, and both are around 40% from the field. Free throws haven't been falling for anyone. Harvard is 2-6 and St. John's is 0-2. Emily Tay has been her baller self, but she's giving the rock up too much (five turnovers). Berry is 2-2 from the field, but hasn't really been a big factor yet.Intermission: Some things never change, no matter where you are. It's time for little kids playing basketball! Probably the most entertaining halftime gimmick ever.Intermission: Three years at Harvard have eaten away at my Queens roots. I keep calling the Red Storm the Big Red. Freaking Ivy League.HALFTIME: St. John's 32, Harvard 29. You have to like what you see from the Crimson. The Red Storm was pretty awful in conference play, but this is a Big East team.0:00 - Red Storm is up 32-29. Berry draws a foul before he buzzer and will shoot two. She misses the first one and the...the second rims out.19:00 - Two airballs in a row from Tay, and St. John's takes the lead on two straight fast break layups.17:19 - It's 29-26 Harvard right now with under three minutes left in the first half. Tay and Markley have been driving the Crimson offense, and the Harvard bigs are holding their own in the post. And of course, you can't ignore the pleasant surprise from Christine Matera, who has hit threes every time the team needed one.16:22 - My next door neighbor in press row says "I feel like this game's been played in slow motion." I guess I'm the only one enjoying myself.15:29 - Brogan Berry takes one step too many and a nice layup is negated.14:20 - MATERA FROM THREE AGAIN. SHE'S ON FIRE. Now she gets to shoot till she misses right?12:57 - St. John's is putting the press on, and Harvard seems a bit flustered the first time. But the Crimson doesn't make the same mistake twice and Matera hits a wide-open three. 22 all.12:45 - Timeout on the floor. Christina from Las Vegas is taking part in the Red Storm shootout. She makes the layup. Banks in the free throw. Can she do it? Needs more range on the three. Using the "soccer inbound style." Just not meant to be Christina. In case anyone was wondering, I took the under.12:15 - Harvard's bruisers are putting in work down low. Katie Rollins and Clara Wheeler knocked some bodies around before Wheeler scored on a put-back.11:30 - Matera nails a three to pull Harvard within three.10:49 - St. John's just went on a tear and pulled ahead, 20-14. Harvard needs to stop the bleeding.9:04 - Markley hits a turnaround J. St. John's guard Britney Murphy answers with a three. If nothing else this game is exciting.8:35 - It's 13-12 Red Storm. Gotta give it to Harvard for hanging tough with a Big East squad.8:24 - Bro-o-o-o-o-o-o-gan Berry makes a sick move, beats her defender and puts home a nice layup.7:04 - Both teams playing kind of sloppy. Lots of turnovers all-around.6:13 - A St. John's three puts the Big Red up by one. Christine Matera in for the Crimson.5:27 - And Harvard takes its first lead of the game on a jumper from Emma Markley. She leads the team with six. 8-6 Harvard.4:51 - Official timeout. Now's a good time for some trivia that only matters to me. Carnesecca Arena is named after legendary Red Storm coach Lou Carnesecca. First person to email me (lamor@fas.harvard.edu) the high school where Carnesecca started his fabled coaching career gets a fake free gift card to Red Line (Hint: the answer is on my Facebook profile).4:09 - Emily Tay wets two consecutive jumpers to tie the game at eight and force a St. John's timeout. If Tay goes off, Harvard's got a real shot at this one.3:10 - As someone who's used to live-blogging hockey games, it's going to take me a bit to adjust to the pace. Bear with me readers. 8-4 St. John's right now.2:00 - Emma Markley gets Harvard on the board.1:40 - Red Storm's Ledbetter with some nice moves. This could get out of control early unless Harvard settles down. 4-0 St. John's.:19 - St. John's Stevens gets an early steal and scores the first two points of the game on an easy layup.

The Class of 2012 is obviously much less emotionally involved than the rest of us are. Either that, or housing has somehow become less of a Big Deal.
Flyby went out delivering letters Housing Day morning as part of the Quincy house delegation in order to witness freshman sorrow and joy--that sweet trial and tribulation--firsthand. But with the exception of an unconfirmed rumor that one new Currierite vomited after receiving their housing news, the morning progressed rather un-dramatically. More after the jump.
Quincy letters are generally expected to generate loud cheering and extreme happiness.  This is standard. But most of this year's recipients--with the exception of a couple of Greenough groups--remained strangely apathetic, with one girl even shooing the earnest upperclassmen away from her door. The Quincyites made several attempts to infiltrate frosh rooms in order to elevate the excitement, but to no avail: most newbies stood around rather awkwardly, accepting their fate happily but not emoting much more.
Flyby talked to couriers from Dunster, Winthrop, Cabot, Currier, and Pfoho--all unpopular assignments both by reputation and Flyby rating--and no one reported any strange or dramatic negative reactions by freshmen: no tears, no arguing, no collapses in despair. At least not that anyone saw.
One Cabot resident noted that some freshmen reacted to their assignment with silence...followed by door shutting. Not unsurprising, considering their newfound Quad status. But one would have expected to see at least a few blocking groups crying. Even new Dunsterites were said to have reacted positively to the Moose-spearheaded contingency.
Currier residents tried to spice up their delivery by donning bathing suits for their tour of the Yard. The method seems to have worked. Says Currier resident Marsha Sukach '11,

In the sequel to our critically-acclaimed first House t-shirt post, we at FlyBy are going to bring the WOOD.  Want to know which newly-inducted frosh were disappointed by their House's offering? Who loved 'em? Read on.
The Regan MacNeil Award for "Holy F***, Did an Exorcism Just Occur?"
So we started perusing the Leverett shirt, didn't mind the Obama knockoff (although not terribly imaginative), okay..."Lev We Can," ...fine, and OMG DID SOMEONE KILL A BUNNY?!?
Seriously, Lev, whose idea was it to slaughter your mascot and use that image on the t-shirt?  We knew Lev is a bunch of crazies, but this is ridic.
But we hear that at next month's brain break, alongside the "famous" monkeybread, there will lapin fraiche. So you've got that going for you...which is nice.
More t-shirts that we (and you, hopefully) love to hate (and sometimes love!) after the jump.

 
The N. Gregory Mankiw Award for Your Eyelids are Getting Heavier. And Heavier…
So…What?
We don’t see the connection between the City of Brotherly Love and Lowell House. Even if Lowell residents (and we) have some affection for the House.
This shirt has absolutely nothing to do with Lowell specifically. It’s sort of confusing looking. And super random (even though word on the street said girls thought it was adorbs). We at FlyBy are bored. Next!
The Steve Urkel Award for "You’re Not Exactly Desirable, but Awesome Anyway"...Also, You're from the '90s 
Usually, we're not quick to fawn on things. Especially not houses in the Quad. But for reals. This shirt is sweet. And not just because FlyBy <3s the 90s. The shirt actually reflects a concrete thing the House has to be proud of—that one thing (other than the fact that it’s super far away) that everyone knows Pfoho for—the '90s dance, for you n00bs. It’s a real reflection of House pride, and it’s something everyone can identify as Pfoho.  And it has pretty colors.
For once, Pfoho, we at FlyBy commend you. This shirt sort of makes us want to be in your House. Sort of.
We're probably taking a break from housing stuff for a while...Happy spring break!
