After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
History professor emeritus Wallace T. MacCaffrey, a former chair of the History Department and an avid scholar of the Elizabethan era, died Dec. 13 in Cambridge, England. He was 93.
An advisor to countless undergraduate and graduate students, MacCaffrey also wrote several influential books about high politics and policymaking in early modern Britain, including Elizabeth I, a biography of the English queen. Friends and colleagues said they remember the former Guggenheim fellow as a diligent historian and supportive mentor.
“He was a towering intellect and consummate scholar, yet he seemed so eager not to intimidate; in conversation he might share a personal detail, such as having to summon all his courage before approaching a daunting task,” Marie C. Henson ’88, one of MacCaffrey’s former students, wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Henson wrote that she first met MacCaffrey as a freshman in one of his History and Literature courses. During office hours, MacCaffrey always made students feel as if they “had done him a great favor by approaching him with a question,” she wrote. Henson added that MacCaffrey continued to play a significant role throughout her life, enthusiastically supporting her application for a Mellon Fellowship.
MacCaffrey came to Harvard in 1968 after teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles and Haverford College. He chaired the History Department at Harvard twice in an era when it was notoriously selective in awarding professorships. Along with his wife, Isabel G. MacCaffrey, he was a Lowell House affiliate, frequently interacting with undergraduates.
During his time at Haverford, MacCaffrey taught and mentored former Harvard history professor Akira Iriye, who said that he credits MacCaffrey with teaching him “how to study history [and] how to write history.
As a freshman who had recently moved from Japan, Iriye said he encountered some difficulties in his early academic work at Haverford because he was not yet fully proficient in English. But after MacCaffrey encouraged him to speak up more during class discussions, Iriye said he took his advice and “never stopped talking,” adding that he feels “personally indebted to him as a teacher.”
Isabel MacCaffrey, a former head of History and Literature at Harvard, died in 1978. When Wallace MacCaffrey retired in 1990, he moved to Girton, a village near Cambridge, England, where he served as a fellow at Trinity Hall, a college of the University of Cambridge.
According to John Morrill, a friend of MacCaffrey and a professor at Cambridge, MacCaffrey often visited the college library during his retirement, chatting with students and attempting to read the works of all the scholars that he had met in his lifetime.
Though MacCaffrey often spent time in hospitals due to physical ailments late into his life, he sustained his love for learning and habit of “devouring history books,” said David H. Sacks, a professor at Reed College and one of MacCaffrey’s former students.
“When he was in the hospital, you’d always find him with an 800-page book,” he said. “If you asked him what he thought of it, you’d have a half-hour, engaging conversation about the subject of the book and the qualities of the scholarship of the book.
Like others, Sacks called MacCaffrey a “compulsive mentor” and “truly wonderful teacher.”
 
A memorial service in honor of MacCaffrey will be held in Girton, England on Jan. 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team returned home with a bang. After a month of road games, the Crimson (8-3) returned to Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday with a 60-41 win over the Hofstra Pride (4-5). The win marks Harvard’s best start since the 1997-98 season, when the Crimson began its season 16-2.
“The fact that we could have a win, as ugly as it may have been on the offensive end … I am thrilled,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I was a little frustrated with the shots. We got a lot of [opportunities] that did not fall for us … The irony is that we tend to think we shoot better when we play at home.”
Though the Crimson had a more difficult time scoring as the game progressed, the team opened the match with a 12-2 run. The Pride failed to capitalize on 13 of its first 14 shots in the early minutes of the contest.
“This game was just a question of who could stop the other team better,” junior Ali Curtis said. “I think we came out, and we wanted to make a point to them that they weren’t going to stay in the game. That’s what we did from the very beginning.”
Junior Erin McDonnell put up nine of the 12 points scored in the first eight minutes of play. Along with McDonnell, classmates Temi Fagbenle played a critical role in the Crimson’s triumph. Fagbenle led the team in rebounds, scrambling to recover 15 boards to go with her 15 points.
“Temi just established herself as an incredible rebounder from the jump ball,” Delaney-Smith said. “She was dominant on the boards…She is such a talent and she contributes to our game defensively, and she’s always good for double figures. She’s amazing.”
After the initial Harvard push, Hofstra refused to stop fighting. The Pride’s Annie Payton scored seven straight points in the opening of the second half, bringing her team within 10 points, 32-22. However, three consecutive Harvard triples, two by McDonnell, catapulted the Crimson lead back to a safe 18 points, which Harvard maintained for the rest of the game.
McDonnell finished the match with seven rebounds and led the team with 17 points.
“Erin is a huge piece of who we are,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a great three-point shooter, she’s a power player inside, and she’s starting to become a better and better defensive player for us.”
McDonnell and Fagbenle have been key players in the Crimson program this season: Fagbenle has averaged 13.6 buckets a game and 9.9 rebounds, while McDonnell averages 11.4 points per game.
“The team will continue to look for them as leaders both on and off the field,” Delaney-Smith said. “They work hard in practice, and it clearly pays off in the games.”
Other familiar faces contributed to the victory. Sophomore AnnMarie Healy put up a career-high 10 points and nine rebounds, while seniors Melissa Mullins and Jasmine Evans each chipped in five points and six rebounds.
“This was a team effort,” Curtis said. “It was just a great game overall. It was a fun game to take part in.”
In the two teams’ last meeting, Harvard barely scraped out a win, defeating Hofstra 70-67 in an overtime victory. The year prior, the Crimson walked away victorious in the first round of WNIT play, conquering the Pride 73-71.
“Our defense and rebounding was spectacular today and that made all the difference,” Delaney-Smith said. “With great effort on defense, the offense becomes so much less important.”
With Saturday’s win, Harvard’s home record improved to 4-0. However, the Crimson will not see Lavietes Pavilion again until January 25th.
“It was great being home,” Curtis said. “There was a good crowd there, and I know we are all going to miss playing here in front of Harvard fans in the upcoming month.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After spending the last month on the road, the Harvard men’s basketball team finally made its return to Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday in historic fashion.
Led by an offensive outburst from sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers, the Crimson (10-1) notched the 250th win in team history at Lavietes, defeating Vermont (4-8), 74-68.
Chambers’ 27 points marked a career high for the sophomore guard. However, more impressive than Chamber’s point total was his efficiency from the floor. The underclassman shot nine-for-10 from the field and a perfect six-for-six from beyond the arc.
“Siyani was tremendous for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He was a surgeon today. He was precise, and he quarterbacked our team…I was so pleased with how he played and how he propelled us to victory.”
After leading for the majority of the contest, the Crimson surrendered a 15-4 run to the Catamounts with 11:05 to go in the game, allowing the visitors to go up 48-45. However, Harvard quickly responded.
Following a bucket from junior forward Jonah Travis that cut the lead to one, Chambers began to take control of the game. After grabbing a rebound on the defensive end, co-captain Laurent Rivard found Chambers in the corner, who drained a three, putting the Crimson back on top, 50-48.
Two minutes later, Chambers had the ball in his hands again.  Dribbling at the top of the key, the point guard gained separation with a crossover and a step-back move, before draining another three that brought the lead back up to double digits, effectively sealing the victory.
“When [Siyani] gets in his moods, you always here him talking, [and] you always hear him vocal,” senior forward Kyle Casey said. “When he’s ready to attack and he decides to take over for a few possessions or a half or anything like he did tonight, it’s special to watch.”
Prior to surrendering the run that put Harvard up for good, the Catamounts had been playing up to expectations as the preseason favorite in the America East Conference. After the team struggled in the early going, senior guard Sandro Carissimo sparked a Vermont resurgence. Over the course of the Catamounts’ 15-4 run early in the second half, the Vermont co-captain added eight of his game-high 30 points.
Carissimo’s scoring output did not come as a surprise to Amaker. In last year’s contest between the two teams, the guard led all scoring with 25 points, carrying the Catamounts to an 85-78 victory.
“We weren’t able to guard [Carissimo] for whatever reason,” Amaker said. “That kid’s a very good player…He’s like Siyani—a crafty, savvy player.”
Junior forward Wesley Saunders had the difficult task of guarding Carissimo, but foul trouble kept him off the floor for much of the game. Consequently, Harvard’s leading scorer this season only had six points on the game, four of which came at the free throw line.
The game had the makings of a blowout in the early going. The Crimson opened the contest by converting eight of its first 11 shots, while the Catamounts missed each of their first seven attempts.
With 14:27 remaining in the first half, all five Harvard starters had already put themselves on the score sheet. However, it quickly became clear that Chambers was in command for the Crimson. The point guard hit all four of his three-point attempts in the half, leading all scorers at the break with 12.
After the Crimson took a 15-point lead with 10:38 to play in the half, the Catamounts quickly began to find their rhythm. Shooting 53 percent from the field for the rest of the half, Vermont stormed back with a run of its own, cutting the deficit to 36-31 at halftime.
In addition to the sharp shooting from Carissimo, the Catamounts’ run revolved around their work on the glass. Vermont outrebounded the Crimson 14-6 on the offensive end, allowing the team to generate 20 second-chance points.
“[I was] disappointed in our ability to keep them off the offensive glass,” Amaker said. “Fourteen offensive rebounds for that team is way too many for us to give up.”
Nonetheless, production from the Harvard bench ultimately proved to be the difference in the game, as the Crimson's bench outscored the Catamounts’ second unit 18-4. The sophomore pair of Evan Cummings and Agunwa Okolie combined for 11 points, six rebounds, and three blocks.
Additionally, in just 12 minutes of play, Travis notched seven points and four rebounds.
“Like Coach [Amaker] always says, Jonah is a junkyard dog,” Chambers said. “He came in and gave us a shot on the arm. He was all over the glass, all over the backboard, making those scrappy plays that the team needed in order to win.”
