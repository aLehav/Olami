At this point, Yo La Tengo should need no introduction. The Hoboken, NJ trio haven’t been a part of indie rock history so much as the barometer for its highs and lows. Emerging in the mid-80s with a series of distinctively exuberant college-rock LPs, the band pioneered a sound that fit somewhere between the fury of second-generation post-punk and the ragged grace of jangle pop. Releases like 1989’s “President Yo La Tengo” look ahead to alternative rock and the last major epoch of indie rock, with a balance of shaggy guitar lines and feedback loops screwed against a subdued but gleeful pop framework. The band’s classic trilogy of mid-90s albums, cresting with 1997’s near-perfect “I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One,” paralleled the success of indie cohorts Pavement and Built to Spill, among others. And while the former burned out and the latter signed to Warner Brothers by the end of the decade, to this day Yo La Tengo release another charming, if not altogether overwhelming record roughly every three years for the independent Matador imprint. Their latest, 2006’s “I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass,” even proved their most musically consistent, sonically adventurous album since “Heart Beat.”So what does any of this have to do with Condo Fucks? Condo Fucks are Ira Kaplan, Georgia Hubley and James McNew. Yo La Tengo is Ira Kaplan, Georgia Hubley and James McNew. But Condo Fucks are not Yo La Tengo—not quite, at least. From their cover of the Kinks’ “Big Sky” on their debut to the Beach Boys’ “Little Honda” on “Heart Beat,” Yo La Tengo, more than any of their contemporaries, wears their influences on their sleeve. The YLT companion to “Fuckbook,” 1990’s “Fakebook,” features 11 acoustic covers of balladeers running the gamut from Cat Stevens and Ray Davies to John Cale and Daniel Johnston. But Condo Fucks take the tastemaker ethic a step further. In lieu delicate tribute to Slade, the Electric Eels and the Troggs, “Fuckbook” grinds 11 more of the band’s favorite numbers—would-be garage and glam-rock hits—into a uniformly chunky, fuzzed-out pulp.All reduction aside, these songs sound pretty much the same. Every track is a short, rambunctious burst of unchained lo-fi energy that squeals and stomps from start to finish. But that’s the point. High points include a murky rendition of the Electric Eels’ “Accident,” filled out with sloppy, half-improvised guitar solos and plenty of feedback, as well as the similarly electrocuted Richard Hell favorite, “The Kid With The Replaceable Head.” A gnashing, two-part race through the Beach Boys’ early single, “Shut Down,” and a punchy one-off of the Zantee’s “So Easy Baby” are so catchy they’d be radio friendly, band name and album title aside. But the finest moment on “Fuckbook” is the unassumingly beautiful cover of the Kinks’ “This Is Where I Belong,” the single cut that could just as easily be on the next Yo La Tengo album. And maybe it should have been instead.Condo Fucks is Yo La Tengo trying to be all things to everyone. By channeling artists whose work presaged the rise of punk, Yo La Tengo are living vicariously through the bands they love. It’s not difficult to imagine a raucous, 20-minute outtake of the Velvet Underground’s “Sister Ray” floating just below the surface on “Fuckbook.” At the same time, Condo Fucks invoke a sonic mantle more recently taken up by lo-fi revivalists like No Age, Abe Vigoda and Times New Viking—the latter even features a track called “Times New Viking Vs. Yo La Tengo” on their latest album. This last point is more coincidence than self-conscious imitation, though; “Fuckbook” is the sound of a band concerned first and foremost with having fun.But as much fun as it is—plenty, to be sure—it’s difficult to decipher what about the project took three years to create. Yo La Tengo may be one of the older and more sedate artists in indie rock, but the thought of a new vehicle by a band that has delivered so much and so flawlessly can’t help but raise expectations that “Fuckbook” never really satisfies. Taken on the terms that the band seem to be implying with a name like “Condo Fucks,” however, it’s a delightful, if minor, addition to the broad Yo La Tengo canon.—Staff writer Ryan J.

Most of us remember the nascent years of pop-punk through a haze not unlike the one that accompanies a few too many drinks. We remember there were some bad decisions, but it’s hard to recall exactly what went wrong, and it’s painful to try to bring it up too soon. New Found Glory, a band whose angsty, love-lorn lyrics have long made them a favorite among high schoolers across America, try to escape from this haze with their new release “Not Without A Fight,” throwing off the mantle of pop-punk (one which they were only awarded de facto) and the glitzy sheen of pop production that denoted it. “Not Without a Fight” aspires to a grittier, harder sound. But while this approach is not without some success, ultimately the album sags under the weight of its overused clichés and utterly insipid lyricism.Right from the start, the album smacks of NFG’s new sound. “Right Where We Left Off” barrels forth with heavily distorted, amped up guitars and dizzying cymbal crashes that don’t seem to actually have anything to do with the song’s rhythm. The first few tracks ring with an anthemic quality fueled by simple, catchy guitar riffs and en masse, screamed choral parts. While there are no clear standout singles, tracks like “Listen to Your Friends” and “Don’t Let Her Pull You Down” sound like they could find some mainstream success in addition to pleasing the legions of NFG fans who still cry out for albums full of endemically inane subjects and lyrics.The single best track of the album is “Truck Stop Blues,” which espouses a more minimalist approach, foregoing the occasionally heavy-handed instrumentality of the other tracks to highlight lead singer Jordan Pudnik’s high-pitched but attractive vocals. These vocals have been trimmed of the nasal stylings with which Pudnik intoned previous albums and work exceptionally convincingly over the track’s shifting tempos, heavy reverb, and bottomless chorus. But while it works when plucked out from the rest of the album, even “Truck Stop Blues” falls prey to the same pratfalls, which will continue to plague NFG as long as they remain rooted in making adolescent love songs—and maybe beyond.Every single song on this album is about a failed or failing relationship, and while this has long been constant fodder for musicians, New Found Glory have almost always sung about nothing but. They’ve long since run out of creative or interesting ways to talk about the subject, if these were ever accessible to them. It’s difficult to even cull exemplary lyrics, since almost every word that the group records is totally inane, but by the time the album progresses through it’s blurry B-side to the penultimate “This Isn’t You,” the simile “Your words break me down like a wrecking ball / I’m so sick of it all” will seem like a godsend. Other gems like “It’s time that I rain on your parade / Watch as all your hopes explode to landmines” on the second track, “Don’t Let Her Pull You Down,” are so commonplace that it’s hard to harp on anything else. Granted, there are some interesting narrative angles, as in “Listen to Your Friends,” where the protagonist wakes up from a coma and tries to unravel what happened to him (I’ll give you a hint—it involves a note in his pocket which reads “I don’t ever want to see you again”), but most of the lyrical content vacillates between drivel and schmaltz. Yet in order to maintain commercial success, perhaps NFG need do little more than tweak their music for an era unenthused with pop-punk and make angst-ridden songs about abortive romances. After all, there will always be an audience for this type of music, and while they may not expand their fan base much, New Found Glory can at least escape the haze of the late 90s by reaching out again and again to the new manifestation of the same audience.—Staff writer Joshua J.

“I want to start a fire / in your heart tonight / Oh tell me why do I so yearn to cause trouble,” Mirah sang over a saucy gypsy beat on her 2001 sophomore album “Advisory Committee.” On the her latest effort, “(a)spera,” there’s little trouble to be found.Mirah warbles and moans as sweetly as ever, but some of the spunk seems to have been lost in the four years since her last solo effort. She’s made the metamorphosis from her more raucous indie-folk inspired early albums to a more mature singer-songwriter niche, but it’s not clear that the softer spirit allows her to express her full potential. The occasional ominous rumbling of drums or the wound-up melodrama of vibrating string sections hint at powerful release, but Mirah tends to fall back onto lovely but less memorable softness. Mirah’s restraint seems set on driving home the pessimism underlying so many of her songs, as when she sings on “The World Is Falling”: “From here we crouch and watch the plunder of the world we built with sweat and love / Why were you not built for wonder? / Why will we never get enough?” Like 2004’s spirited “Jerusalem,” this track addresses the heavy subject of Middle Eastern politics. But unlike that uplifting peace anthem, this seems a forlorn meditation, full of loss rather than hope. Melancholy pervades the album’s love songs as well. Sexiness and whimsy have faded in favor of mournful strains and cooing. On “Education” Mirah sounds more jaded, and a little less fun than in the past. On “The River” she sings, “tears so thick like glue they drip and build castles slow,” a statement that describes much of the album: slow songs that drip and blend into one another. However, the castle she builds is a lovely one, and “(a)spera” is far from a disappointment. Mirah’s songs are lyrical blends of exquisite vocals for which the always varied musical accompaniment is like perfectly chosen punctuation. They coalesce to make a calm and collected sweetness. And despite the overall softness, Mirah still infuses her mellow songstress sound with the more experimental. “Country Of the Future” is a trippy invitation to dance set to a carnival beat, and “The Forest” has a drum and horn-filled ending that lends it a satisfying hard edge. The globally-minded elements put her in the company of fellow folk-rocker Zach Condon of Beirut: tasteful sampling from a wide range of musical influences without ever seeming like world-music kitsch. “(a)spera” ends with “While We Have the Sun,” featuring a tingling melody on a kalimba, underlining Mirah’s capacity to make pure prettiness from exotic and unexpected elements. She ends the album on a hopeful note singing, “Sorry about all the sorrows.” It’s a tempered end to an album about the melding of beauty and pain, a conflict that ultimately comes down on the side of the pretty.But the opening song might provide the best summary of the album. “Generosity” strikes closest to Mirah’s signature meld of melancholy and heightened sense of drama, but also teases us with what seems to be missing from the rest of the album. The song is about being drained and used up by love: “It was all of my energy / More than I wanted to give / I am empty.” She certainly bares herself in her lyrics, but not, it seems, in the music. While out of her emptiness she makes some lovely sounds, the lack of energy is palpable through the album. As she sings in the refrain “I won’t give more,” the chorus responds with a justifiable desire: “We just want more.” “(a)spera” just doesn’t quite give enough.—Staff writer Cora K.

Turns out Kelly Clarkson is forever bound to pop after all. After her alt-rock detour on 2007’s “My December,” she returns to her crowd-pleasing ways, belting out the type of pop anthems she’s best known for. “All I Ever Wanted,” Clarkson’s fourth release, showcases her vocal strengths better than ever. Good pop comebacks are not a dime-a-dozen, but in spite of some minor setbacks, the singer manages to come out with yet another success.Reclaiming her “Since U Been Gone”-era style, Clarkson screams her lungs out throughout the entire album, yet keeps her songs accessible and fun. She continues to crank out boy-bashing girl power tunes, like “I Do Not Hook Up,” in which she declares: “Oh, no, I do not hook up, up / I go slow / So if you want me, I don’t come cheap / Keep your hand in my hand / And your heart on your sleeve.” Clarkson’s dignified message is refreshing in contrast to the “I Kissed a Girl” pop landscape, which is especially ironic since Katy Perry co-wrote “I Do Not Hook Up.” This won’t be the first time she succeeds in making another singer’s composition her own: 2004’s “Breakaway” was written by Avril Lavigne. Ryan Tedder, of OneRepublic, appears as another co-songwriter, contributing “Already Gone,” ”Impossible,” and “If I Can’t Have You”—soothing tunes, generating some of the album’s more moving pieces and adding to the cheerful and energetic whole.The album opener and lead single, “My Life Would Suck Without You,” despite the horrendous title, stands out with its catchy melody, electrifying chorus, and danceable beats. But oddly, “I Do Not Hook Up,” which follows, has the same exact beat. The two songs show off Clarkson’s versatile voice, but it doesn’t make up for their lack of creative rhythms.Throughout the album Clarkson does little in the way of innovation, and a number of tracks sound like faceless, impersonal pop production numbers. Album closer “If No One Will Listen,” with its soft instrumentation and gentle verses that lead into a long climactic chorus, recalls Celine Dion. “Long Shot” with its youthful yet raspy sound, along with the leaping motion of the chorus, would sound more at home on a Miley Cyrus album. The tune is catchy, but fails to allow Clarkson’s voice to shine through. But sometimes Clarkson’s own voice is the culprit, such as on “Don’t Let Me Stop You,” in which she strains herself trying to match her words to the music, resulting in strange inflections and awkward embellishments.The occasional use of Auto-Tune and other vocal effects on tracks like “If I Can’t Have You” only adds to this impersonal feel. Successful enough to afford the best production and good enough to show off her bare voice she has no reason to cover her powerful vocals. It seems Clarkson tried too hard to keep up with pop trends.Although her album is marked with minor blemishes, they will not overshadow her widely-anticipated and overall successful return to mainstream pop. Other than a few blunders, Kelly Clarkson proves to us once more that she’s still got what it takes to be a succesful pop artist. After her misguided detour with “My December,” she’s once again singing catchy, powerful songs, and the result is not half bad. She’s even given us a new “Since U Been Gone” with “My Life Would Suck Without U,” which will likely be played at every single party for the next month or so, accompanying raving teenagers yelling their praise of Clarkson’s return: “Cause we belong together now, yeah / Forever united here somehow, yeah / You got a piece of me / And honestly / My life would suck without you.”

In the serene intimacy of a wood-paneled gallery at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, two slender violin bows dipped up and down against the backdrop of a 15th century Italian painting last Friday afternoon. The violinists, dressed elegantly in black with splashes of red and white, focused intently on the delicacy of their work. A small audience of museum-goers stood and perched on folding stools nearby, while others calmly perused the surrounding artwork. Even gallery security guards stretched their beats slightly to watch the performance. In adjoining rooms, the airborne cadences of concertos reached statues, portraits, vases, and painted panels.
The violinists were Shiyu Wei ’10 and Shuang Wu ’11, and their concert was a part of the ongoing Student Music Performance Series, organized by the Harvard Arts Museums Education Department. They performed Bach, Vivaldi, Bartók, and Telemann in galleries devoted to the “Western Tradition, Antiquity to 1900.” On five more Friday afternoons this spring, Harvard student musicians will hold hour-long performances with various pieces suited to different galleries of the Sackler. The series aims not only to inform the viewing of visual art from a musical angle but also to redefine the museum experience for students.
“There’s a way in which it’s about learning, and there’s another way in which it’s about relaxing,” Director of Education for HAM Ray Williams says. While the works performed are chosen specifically to provide musical context for the art in specific galleries, the careful matching of “culture and period” in both genres is not the only goal of the project. As part of a larger initiative in the department to enhance “connections to the student community,” Williams and his colleagues aim to assure students who would normally just pass by the Sackler that the galleries can be a tranquil haven away from the stress of classes. 
Along the same lines, the department is “preparing some study break programming during reading week [including] sketching, yoga...art talks and mak[ing] cookies to remind people that the museum can be a place to come for relaxation and nourishment,” Williams says.
Indeed, Friday’s violinists showcased the relaxing quality of their talent, as well as their impressive skill. Both began to play in early childhood and are still active in the Harvard music community. Wei has played with the Mozart Society Orchestra and still sings in the Radcliffe Choral Society, while Wu has played for various Harvard orchestras and Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club musicals like “Nine.” The skill of the musicians combined with the gallery’s acoustics, so clear Wu likened them to those of a cathedral, produced a pure and energetic sound that resonated throughout the fourth-floor galleries. 
The audience members were not the only ones to appreciate the performance. When asked about the unique experience, Wu noted that it was “more relaxed than a formal performance in front of a lot of people.” Wei felt indebted to Janet M. Sartor, Public Programs Coordinator of Harvard Art Museums, who urged Wu to try out at the open audition.
On top of its therapeutic entertainment value, though, the performances raise questions about whether or not a musical experience can contribute to a visual one. The art among which Wei and Wu played—works by artists as stylistically and chronologically diverse as Edgar Dégas, James McNeill Whistler, Fra Angelico, Daniel Chester French and contemporary artist Max Grotjahn—is united in the fourth floor galleries to draw “attention not only to technical and stylistic innovations, but especially to continuities and revivals of themes and styles,” according to the galleries’ posted introduction. 
In a collection emphasizing “both different approaches and artistic interconnections” between art of different time periods, it seems only natural to explore “interconnections” between different media as well. The same cultural forces and political events would influence the development of Western music and Western art through the ages—but they remain fundamentally distinct media. Can unconscious or background perception of one inform a conscious experience of the other? Can a lively Vivaldi duet contribute anything to French’s “Abraham Lincoln, 1916?” Were the violinists’ bows dipping into mythological hills of painted panels unwelcome intrusions or further brushstrokes? With upcoming performances at 3:30 p.m. every Friday—except during Spring Break—through April, the Student Music Performance Series has the potential to blur artistic boundaries while reaching out to students looking for revitalization.

Earlier this week, President Barack Obama announced a series of major reforms to the American public education system. In an address to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, he proposed increased spending for the hiring of new teachers as well as greater funding for Head Start and other early childhood education programs. Especially promising, his plan would institute merit pay for teachers in up to 150 school districts, lift the limits on charter schools that exist in some states, and make it easier for schools to fire underperforming teachers. We are encouraged by President Obama’s commitment to the innovative policies he proposed during his campaign and are pleased to see his willingness to challenge teachers’ unions—a key Democratic constituency—in the pursuit of a better education for young Americans.
The quality of public education in the United States, on average, is lackluster. Though math and science scores are up nationwide, study after study still finds that students in U.S. schools underperform compared to students in many other developed countries. Teachers’ poor classroom performance is thought to be a major cause of this education gap, and President Obama has wisely identified teachers’ pay scale as a main determinant of teacher quality. Currently, teachers’ compensation is largely based on their seniority. After teachers gain tenure at a school, their salary steadily increases over time, and they become nearly impossible for administrators to dismiss. This system discourages teacher effort by removing the financial incentive to work harder. Furthermore, college graduates who might otherwise pursue a career in education are discouraged by the fact that greater effort does not result in a commensurate reward. This accommodation pleases teachers’ unions and their members, but at the expense of the students they teach.
Merit pay would go a long way toward correcting this imbalance. Under the system President Obama has proposed, teachers whose students show significant improvement would be eligible for performance-based bonuses. This is only fair: A higher quality of work should be rewarded with greater pay, just as it is in nearly every other career. Merit pay incentivizes greater teacher effort, encourages high-achieving college graduates to become teachers, and makes it easier to identify the worst teachers and fire them. This improves overall teacher quality and benefits students in the end.
Charter schools are another important tool in fostering higher levels of academic achievement. They offer smaller class sizes, more rigorous course loads, and provide students with a viable alternative to failing public schools—placing additional pressure on these schools to improve in response. They also act as “laboratories of innovation,” according to President Obama, in turning out new education methods. Many large cities, including New York and Los Angeles, have seen significant improvement in education quality thanks to the proliferation of charter schools. Illogically, 26 states cap the number of charter schools that can be operated within their borders. President Obama’s plan would lift these limits, which, in his words, are “not good for our children, our economy, or our country.”
Teachers’ unions have a vested interest in preserving the status quo. They fear that merit pay and charter schools will make teachers more accountable for their performances and put the unions’ worst members at risk of being dismissed. This perverse incentive has stymied Democratic politicians’ efforts at school reform for decades. But President Obama’s refusal to kowtow to a powerful lobby, even if it forms a strong base of support for his party, demonstrates his independence and desire to put campaign promises into action. This is encouraging for the state of education in this country.
Our economic strength tomorrow depends on the quality of education American children receive today. President Obama’s proposals represent a courageous effort to put the needs of the next generation ahead of the demands of a special-interest group. We hope that Congress will share his enthusiasm for reform and back the president’s commendable proposals. Though teachers’ unions may sulk, the Obama education plan has the potential to erase the culture of complacency that pervades too many of our schools. For that, it deserves a gold star.

What do “amateurish,” “singsongy,” and “stale” have in common? Apparently, they all mean brown.
On Feb. 25, replying to the pillories of Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal’s lilting response to President Obama’s address to the nation, blogger Ann Althouse asked, “Why are all these people so confident that they are not manifesting racism?” Thus began another episode of race-card Tourette’s. Though many hoped that such accusatory innuendo would cease with Obama’s election, its metastasis to the right has exposed its severity.
Some of the ridicule directed at Jindal could have been racial, like White House reporter Helen Thomas’s branding of Jindal as “pitiful” before joking about the movie Slumdog Millionaire. But to believe that all of his criticism was racist requires a willing suspension of disbelief.
Jindal’s critics included Fox News correspondent Juan Williams, who called Jindal’s performance “amateurish” and “singsongy,” and New York Times columnist David Brooks, who tagged it “stale.” When listing the many stereotypes attributed to Indian Americans, amateurism, singsong, and staleness seldom come to mind.
How, then, does Althouse defend her groundless claim? The day after her blog post, Althouse crafted this egg-headed explanation of how comparisons of Jindal to country boy Kenneth Parcell of NBC’s 30 Rock were racial: “Instinctively repainting [Jindal] white is—I would say—presumptively racial. To strip away his racial identity—to stereotype him as an especially white white man—is a powerful racial move.”
The desperate mental contortionism employed here to slander Jindal’s bipartisan critics evokes the illogic used during the 2008 presidential election by a cavalcade of left-wing commentators, including Slate’s John Dickerson, The Kansas City Star’s Lewis Diuguid, and author David Shipler. These pundits claimed that nearly every criticism aimed at Obama was a Machiavellian ploy, using subtle wordplay to remind white voters of his blackness—even if this criticism did not reference race at all.
Certainly, there was some undeniable racialism—Georgia Congressman Lynn Westmoreland calling Obama “uppity,” rabid left-winger Ralph Nader referring to him as “Uncle Tom,” and the ever-clever rhymesters at Fox News calling Michelle Obama “Obama’s baby mama” come to mind. But Dickerson’s assertion that for “a lot of voters... when you talk about experience with respect to Obama, that’s code for people’s continuing uncomfortableness about his race” does not fall into this category. Dickerson offered no evidence to buttress his claim, for there is none.
Worse still was Diuguid’s allegation that calling Obama “socialist” was racist due to J. Edgar Hoover’s labeling of civil-rights icons Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. Du Bois as such. Just because the long list of individuals smeared as socialist happens to include prominent blacks alongside prominent whites like Franklin Roosevelt and every Democrat since does not make the word racial. Furthermore, the socialism charge was not leveled until Obama told a certain plumber that he wished to “spread the wealth around.” If encrypted racialism was intended, then why wait until this episode to wield it?
The epithet “elitist” also came into currency only when Obama observed that Pennsylvanians are “bitter” and “cling to guns or religion,” yet somehow Shipler declared that “‘elitist’ is another word for ‘arrogant,’ which is another word for ‘uppity’”—claiming, ergo, that any word synonymous with a synonym of a racial slur is a racial slur.
All of these words have been used against white politicians in the past. John Kennedy was called inexperienced, and John Kerry elitist and arrogant, for reasons other than blackness. Granted, some words, like “welfare queens” and “busing,” have used blacks as wedges between whites, but the terms “inexperienced,” “socialist,” and “elitist” have no such racial dimension. The truth is that nearly any word can be construed as racial. By labeling every argument against non-white candidates as racist, defenders of Jindal and Obama indicate that all criticism of their candidate is racist and that the only reason not to support him is racism.
Either that, or they are simply exploiting race to insulate their candidate from criticism—but we all know that they would never do that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, ethnic Albanians in Kosovo celebrated the one-year anniversary of their country’s independence from Serbia. This anniversary is, in some ways, a triumph for Kosovo. The United Nations-backed government is slowly taking over some of its own administration, although 15,000 NATO troops are still deployed there to maintain security and internal stability.
But, despite this progress, Kosovo is by no means in a secure position regarding its statehood. Serbia continues to claim that Kosovo is still part of Serbia, and the refusal of Russia as well as many other countries, including five European Union member states, to recognize Kosovo’s independence has contributed to international ambiguity regarding Kosovo’s status. The conflict is not limited to the diplomatic sphere; last year, when the United States officially recognized Kosovo’s independence, riots broke out in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, and in Kosovo itself ethnic tensions between Serbians and ethnic Albanians are still rife.
Although conditions have improved drastically since the Kosovo War in 1998-9, it is clear that the stabilizing force of EU membership is the only way to normalize relations between the two countries. The EU must immediately take a strong stand in favor of admitting the Balkan nations, including eventually Serbia and Kosovo, if the scars from centuries of ethnic and political conflict in the region are ever to be healed.
While Serbia has traditionally been closer diplomatically to Russia than to the West, its current leadership is pro-Western and has announced its desire to apply for EU membership in the first half of 2009. The Serbian populace would almost certainly look more favorably on their pro-Western governing coalition if joining the EU becomes a more realistic goal.
Serbia is still barred from entrance into the EU, however, by several problems, most notably its failure to comply with EU demands that it arrest Ratko Mladic, a former Bosnian Serb general who is accused of carrying out the massacre at Srebrenica during the 1992-5 Bosnian war. The EU has made it clear that Mladic’s capture will be one of the conditions of Serbia’s membership bid. 
Kosovo also aims to join the EU, and it already uses the euro as its currency. It is, however, far from ready to join. It is still dependent on NATO security forces, and its economy is extremely weak—at least 40 percent of the population is unemployed.
While neither state will be able to join the EU in the near future, Brussels should make it clear to both Belgrade and Pristina that membership is a very real possibility for both—assuming, of course, that they fulfill all the requirements of membership in the near future. This would have major implications for regional stability: Serbia would be discouraged from trying to reclaim Kosovo by force because of the consequences such an action would have for its EU membership bid.
Integrating Serbia and Kosovo into the EU can only remain a far-off prospect until Brussels finishes the accession processes of the more stable Balkan nations that are ready, or close to being ready, for membership. However, the bids of several countries in the region are becoming unnecessarily protracted, leading one to wonder whether the EU’s drive to incorporate the former Yugoslav states will ever be completed. 
Croatia, which should be a shoo-in for membership, is stalled in the accession process because of a border dispute with its neighbor, Slovenia. Montenegro, another flourishing Balkan state, is currently trying to apply for EU membership, but the current global economic state has made the EU leadership cautious about further expansion. Macedonia’s bid, although weaker than Croatia’s or Montenegro’s, cannot move forward because Greece argues that Macedonia’s name suggests an aspiration to the Greek province of the same name.
With some Eastern European member states, most dramatically Latvia, falling into crisis, it is easy to criticize EU expansion and argue that it should be stopped before any more damage is done. However, strong economies like Slovenia, a former Yugoslav state that is now a regional powerhouse, demonstrate the benefits that EU membership can bring, even to countries that were struggling 20 years ago. In addition to cementing the central role of democratic institutions and the market economy, EU enlargement helps other countries in the union, which reap the benefits of free trade and an expanded market.
Kosovo and Serbia are certainly not ready for EU membership right now and probably will not be for some time–-at least until Serbia agrees to at least a de facto recognition of Kosovo’s independence and Kosovo can govern itself without the assistance of NATO forces deployed there. Nevertheless, the EU can and should play its own role in shaping the politics of this region by showing Kosovo and Serbia that it intends to extend EU membership to both of them when they are ready. This is the only way to permanently bring stability to the Balkans and finally banish the specter of the Yugoslav wars from the region’s politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walk into a typical dorm-room party on a weekend night and you will observe the remnants of our civilization, smashed into shards and strewn across the floor.
The throb of European techno music or, worse, the deafening bass of the latest hip-hop beats, laden with profane and misogynistic lyrics, issue out from iPod speakers unimaginatively arranged in the corner. The guests, deprived of any seating and crowded in such numbers as the suite common room cannot comfortably accommodate, avoid futile attempts at conversation above the musical ruckus and instead, gyrating and flailing, awkwardly imitate the choreographic styles fashionable on MTV. And alcohol, the great midwife of this mise en scène, oversees the proceedings, ashamed and self-deprecating, peering out from plastic handles before being consumed in garish red Solo cups mixed with cranberry juice or diet cola.
How far collegiate conviviality has fallen from the civility of a kinder and gentler era. Where once the university quadrangles resounded with the tipsy warbling of De Brevitate Vitae or other commercium songs, now only the echoes of mass-market electronic recordings disturb the silence of Saturday evenings. Beer pong has replaced banter, courtship has yielded to hook-ups, pot is preferred to pipe tobacco. The choice of drink, and the style in which it is quaffed, is likewise illustrative: watery beer or cheap liquor, impurities masked by the syrupy sweetness of sodas and juices, downed in furtive binges. The goal is not to lubricate conversation or ease the inhibitions of awkward adolescence, but to induce a stuporous haze, under which the typical expectations of dignity and decorum may be safely withdrawn. 
The way in which students choose to divert themselves is not an arbitrary and meaningless decision, but rather intimately related to their highest aspirations, principles, and conception of the good life. 
The cultivation of the intellect indeed requires leisure. College years, devoted theoretically to intellectual pursuits, for the most part offer undergraduates time free from quotidian and worldly concerns to engage actively in the life of the mind. Yet the necessity of evaluations and deadlines imposes a sort of business mentality even on the languorous otium of college life. Thus arises the need for those welcome diversions of the weekend.
Alcohol traditionally has featured prominently in these moments of repose from the cares and concerns of life. It drives conversation, accentuates wit, entreats laughter, makes melodious the otherwise shrill and tone-deaf, assuages old grudges, and initiates strangers into easy friendship. It makes possible what, under normal conditions of reality, would be improbable. For that very reason, as well, it poses such a danger if used irresponsibly and excessively. But, when enjoyed properly, drink has served to unite—not to divide—society.
In recent years, Harvard has enacted stringent measures to prevent underage drinking and the sort of dangerous excess that unfortunately has characterized collegiate antics of our generation. But, in banishing wine seminars and mandating BAT teams at House formals, the administration has only encouraged that any actual drinking be furtive and irresponsible. Today, conditioned by the Puritanism of university administrators and society’s moralists to see drinking as an evil—although permissible under certain circumstances—college students expectedly will treat it as such. Intoxication promises an easy high, a cover for actions that otherwise would not be permissible or excusable and that afterward would not be necessary or desirable to remember. All for the small price of a nauseated Saturday morning abed. 
Practiced accordingly, drinking serves only anti-social ends: a collection of unconnected individuals, stumbling out crudely in search of a good time, each alone to enjoy his pleasure and his pain, as long as his own thirst for amusement has been slaked. The popular preference—a cheap and tasteless spirit like vodka, which lends its intoxicating power but not its taste to whatever accompaniment—is indicative. Alcohol has become a mere drug.
In an earlier age, when sources of clean water were more scarce and precious, all men, women, and children drank wine and beer at every meal. The first miracle of Christianity, indeed, was the transformation of water into wine. This powerful and pleasant elixir, truly a precondition of civilization, deserves to be appreciated and used responsibly and appropriately. 
This Lent, sacrifice the vulgar bibulous customs of your college peers. Turn down the boom box and raise the lights. Sip, do not chug. And let the drink in your hand nurse, not eliminate the need for, conversation and charm. Soon, form will follow function. Trade your mass-produced American lager for a Trappist brew, crafted lovingly in a monastery according to a recipe perfected over the centuries. Instead of insipid vodka, open a bottle of aromatic and complex gin—a challenge, indeed, but a meet reward for those with patience and perseverance. And, finally, put down the shot glass—better to stop, for once, and smell the whiskey.

How does Harvard do beauty pageants? Ten hot Asian guys, back flips, and a whole lot of skin.  
This past weekend, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association hosted “Mr. Asian Sensation,” a male beauty pageant featuring undergraduate contestants representing different student groups.  
The Adams Upper Common Room was packed with a rowdy audience including Asians and non-Asians alike, all displaying rumblings of excitement. Sanjin Tunovic ’10 came to support his roommate, contestant Andrew Q. Le ’10. “I can say on those lonely nights when I’m cuddling with him in bed, I’m cuddling with the hottest Asian on campus,” said Tunovic. 
The ten hopefuls introduced themselves during a formal wear segment. Guanyi “Tony” Huang ’12 strutted across the stage in his version of creative black tie: jacket, tie, and boxers. Shirtless. 
Next, contestants displayed talents ranging from mildly impressive to beyond bizarre. The audience got a little too involved, chanting, “Blow it, blow it, blow it,” referring to balloon animals. Christophe A. T. Van ’12 charmed the crowd with his adorable British accent and mind-reading magic tricks.  
Judge Sanyee Yuan ’12 was impressed by the contestants’ lack of inhibitions. “I think the guys have fun on stage,” she said. “Guys are guys, they let everything hang loose.” Daniel E. Minamide ’12 walked the stage in only a tiger-striped Speedo, eliciting a chorus of catcalls. Eyes grew wide when Byron T. Lichtenstein ’11 ripped off his shirt and jiggled his pecs.  
The tension climaxed with the judges’ decision. The audience exploded in applause for Mr. Asian Sensation, Van, who went home with a chance to represent Harvard at Wellesley’s Mr. Asian Student Union pageant, a free haircut, and his own tiara.

Though many Harvardians get their kicks just from the looks of their peers, there may be a better source of humor on campus.Members of the Harvard College Stand Up Comics Society have been invited to the stand-up division of the RooftopComedy’s National College Comedy Competition Tournament, exclusively designed to discover the “funniest” students in America. The bracket-style tournament bases acceptance on the comedic value of clips submitted by college stand-up groups. “There are eight people from each school, and two schools go head-to-head at a local comedy club,” said Charles T. James ’09, a four-year member of HCSUCS. The more hilarious team is voted the winner and proceeds to the next round,  attempting to out-funny other college quipsters.Last year, HCSUCS members representing Harvard went to the competition against a fully-manned Boston College team, but that didn’t put a dent in HCSUCS’s punch lines. “Only four of us went against all of them, but we went up there and we did one of our best performances,” said James. Indeed, Harrison R. Greenbaum ’08 was declared funniest comedian overall. Despite their certified status as a humor group, many at Harvard are not aware of HCSUCS’s tournament ventures, let alone their campus performances.“H what?” said Rachel E. Lee ’10, when asked about the group’s existence. She is certainly not the only one in the dark.“Our performances haven’t been excellently attended,” said David R. Rhein ’09. “Publicity has never been the group’s strong suit. Our thing is jokes.”This year, however, students might find an age-old incentive to attend HCSUCS’s first round competition. Their adversary? Yale. Looks like after a crushing shut out at The Game, the Bulldogs may have a chance to redeem themselves on the stage.

While the poor state of the economy may be drying up job opportunities all over the nation, there is one potential career path that is less subject to the perils of the job market: entrepreneurship. Starting one’s own venture is becoming a more and more popular career choice among Harvard students, a trend that is likely aided by the fact that entrepreneurs are in complete control of their own employment. But while post-college entrepreneurs are able to concentrate on their ventures as their primary occupation, Harvard students face a completely different experience because of the role Harvard plays in their daily lives as well as in their budding businesses.
“I think that in some ways we are limited by the fact that we’re students, but in other ways we’re not as tied down by adult responsibilities,” says Shankar G. Ramaswamy ’11. “And I think that’s an advantage to being a student entrepreneur.” While undergraduates certainly have their fair share of academic and extracurricular responsibilities, the student lifestyle removes many of the responsibilities of adult, post-college life, such as earning a basic living or providing for a family. The security of a college environment allows students to explore their entrepreneurship interests without the added pressure of meeting these needs.
Ramaswamy and his business partner David A. Kosslyn ’11 created their own Web site called PhrazIt, a site that allows users to easily browse and share reviews on various products and services. The pair spent their entire summer last year working with an incubator program, a venture capital firm that focuses on very early stages of company development. Now that the site is up and running, Ramaswamy and Kosslyn no longer need to devote their full time to the project.
Another group of students were motivated to enter the entrepreneurial world after having worked on a Harvard student publication. Windsor G. Hanger ’10 got her start working on Freeze College Magazine and is now utilizing that experience to develop a new magazine geared toward the college crowd that extends nationwide called Her Campus. Hanger says that the success of Freeze within the Harvard community inspired the group to see national expansion as a viable next step.
While Web-based ventures are the most popular among student entrepreneurs because they are low in cost and relatively easy to develop, some entrepreneurs have dared to venture out of cyberspace. Jessica S. Lin ’09, Julia C. Silverman ’10, Hemali A. Thakkar ’11, and Jessica O. Matthews ’10 are currently working on a project called the sOccket, a soccer ball with an internal device that stores energy every time the ball is kicked. The stored energy would be used as a power source, with the target market being underprivileged communities throughout Africa. The four met while enrolled in Engineering Sciences 147: “Idea Translation Lab,” in which they were assigned to work together on a project based on a common global health interest. Rather than an initial interest in entrepreneurship, the idea behind the sOccket itself inspired the venture. “If the idea wasn’t this idea, I probably wouldn’t be spending this much time and energy making it work,” says Lin, who is also a former Crimson associate photo editor. “This idea is just what is driving me to keep going with it past the class.”
WHERE TO GO IF YOU’RE A CEO
Before the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum was founded in fall of 2006 as an undergraduate organization, there had been a string of similar organizations that disappeared after their founders graduated. “Entrepreneurs are hard people to mobilize and you have to create a lot of value to get them to come, so it’s hard to build something sustainable to serve,” says S. Travis May ’09, one of HCEF’s co-founders.
To solve this problem, May and his co-founder Michael Segal ’09 have worked hard to prepare the new co-presidents, Kosslyn and Tommy R. Li ’10, for their leadership roles. The establishment of an executive board, a wide variety of sponsored events, and a developing comp process indicate that HCEF should be well-equipped to sustain its existence.
“Our main bases for the club have been a lot of experienced entrepreneurs, or people who have ideas or have started developing ideas, says Yifan Zhang ’10. “But we’d really like to have people who are interested and really get them interested in learning about entrepreneurship, then participating in their own projects.” Zhang, who was recently elected vice president of communities for HCEF, is currently responsible for the impending comp process and increasing recruitment efforts for the organization. She says that one primary goal is to increase participation from freshmen who may lack prior exposure to entrepreneurship.
Another student entrepreneurship organization on campus is the more established Harvard Student Agencies, which has been in existence for 51 years and was originally founded to provide students with tuition aid through business experience. Unlike HCEF, HSA provides concrete opportunities to practice entrepreneurship by running the existing agencies with the freedom to maintain traditional practices or move the agencies in a new direction. “A lot of the time people think entrepreneurship is just starting new businesses, and it’s not,” says Jim McKellar, the CEO and general manager of HSA. “Entrepreneurship is a way of thinking, you’re doing things differently. You are making things more efficient or better or faster, or you’re providing something new within an existing environment.”
Within Harvard’s administration is a third entrepreneurial organization, the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard. TECH was founded in 1999 by Paul B. Bottino, who currently serves as executive director. In addition to advising students on their various entrepreneurial projects, TECH “works to create additional resources for student entrepreneurs ... and make them available to students and student groups,” Bottino wrote in an e-mail. The TECH Web site includes a database listing potential funding sources and entrepreneurial courses available at the College, graduate schools, and MIT, as well as links to business plan tips, funding advice, and other informational sites.
The three organizations, HCEF, HSA, and TECH, have recently formed a closely-knit and collaborative relationship with one another. Together they manage the annual I^3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge on campus, in which students develop innovative ideas as individuals or in teams and submit business plans. Winners receive grants to fund their projects as well as other resources and services. They are also currently working on developing a communal workspace for entrepreneurs within the HSA building on Mt. Auburn Street.
Although these three groups may be the most prominent entrepreneurship groups at Harvard, there is a growing market for similar student organizations. One such group is the newly formed Harvard chapter of Kairos. Chapter president Vishal Lugani ’11 describes the group as “an intercollegiate and intracollegiate organization that’s aimed at fostering social ties between entrepreneurs.” Unlike some other longstanding organizations, Kairos requires its members to already have some level of involvement in an entrepreneurial venture.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR DUMMIES
While TECH may provide a deep information bank of entrepreneurship resources, many aspiring student entrepreneurs on campus feel that practical training is simply unavailable for undergraduates at Harvard. With the notable exceptions of ES 147, Sociology 159, and Engineering Sciences 139: “Innovation in Science and Engineering,” the College does not offer any classes in professional business skills. Undergraduates are also largely excluded from classes across the river at Harvard Business School, which would otherwise be applicable to their business pursuits. Most students seeking this sort of training, such as accounting or strategic decision making, flock to MIT for classes like the popular Corporate Financial Accounting. Since Harvard allows students to cross-register for these classes already, many students wonder why the opportunity for similar classes isn’t readily available on their own campus.
“Most students who want to learn about accounting go to MIT and students transfer credits for it here at Harvard, but because we don’t see that as being consistent with liberal arts we don’t offer that course to our students,” says David L. Ager, who teaches Sociology 159. Jeffrey A. Miron, the director for undergraduate studies in the Economics Department, was able to give a more practical explanation of the considerations involved. “Why don’t we have the business type of courses in economics? The simple reason is you can’t do everything with finite resources and we don’t have the resources to do those in addition to doing the ones we currently do,” he says.
According to Miron, there are not enough faculty members available to teach classes such as accounting. Even if there were, says Miron, it is unlikely that any Harvard professor would want to teach the class because it would not be seen as valuable within the liberal arts philosophy of education, especially given the relative ease with which factual business information can be learned. “You can spend an afternoon reading ‘Accounting for Dummies’ and learn the accounting if you’ve first taken Ec 10 and 1010 from us,” says Miron. “And so it’s a much better use of your time from every perspective, from both the pre-professional’s perspective and an intellectual’s perspective, to study the courses that we do offer, not the strictly business-oriented courses.”
“You can spend an afternoon reading ‘Accounting for Dummies’ and learn the accounting if you’ve first taken Ec 10 and 1010 from us,” says Miron. “And so it’s a much better use of your time from every perspective, from both the pre-professional’s perspective and an intellectual’s perspective, to study the courses that we do offer, not the strictly business-oriented courses.” Student entrepreneurs know that they can benefit from a liberal arts education rather than a strictly pre-professional one. “I know there’s a lot of talk about how Harvard doesn’t necessarily do more technical things, like finance, accounting, things like that,” says Li. “But I definitely think there’s something to be said for these broad, more liberal arts-based tools that you get, like writing, that’s really important, being able to communicate effectively to people you’re trying to sell your idea to.”
PULLING A BILL GATES
Since the prominent success stories of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both involve a premature termination of their college careers, it sometimes seems impossible to balance a rigorous Harvard academic schedule with running a company. Many student entrepreneurs face a unique dual lifestyle that forces them to reevaluate their priorities.
“At the end of the day at this point we’re students first and entrepreneurs second. As time goes on maybe that will shift and if it weren’t true then we’d pull a Bill Gates and get out of here, but this is what we’re doing right now,” says Silverman. Although dropping out of college completely is not a common end result of student startups, many students do take time away from their college careers to pursue their enterprises at prime opportunities.
May, for example, took a leave of absence to avoid facing the daunting task of juggling academics with his business. “I try to balance them both at the same time,” he says. “I haven’t been inclined to sacrifice one. Part of this is why I took a leave of absence.” While leaves of absence can be beneficial for taking advantage of a company’s growth phase, Ramaswamy says that should always consider returning to college. “These things are so volatile,” he says. “You may think it’s going to be the next biggest thing, and then the factors change. Google launches a new product, and you’re out of business.”
While some students admit that academics can be a barrier to business success, most agree that dropping out of college would be an extreme measure. “I would not drop out of school for a startup,” says Hanger. “But I understand that sometimes you have an idea that’s so amazing that you need to commit full time to it, and your academics might get in the way.” Ramaswamy elaborates further about the benefits of being in school while pursuing a business venture. “Personally speaking, I love the college environment,” he says. “I’ve grown to appreciate that over the past semester, especially being out there in the real world and coming back here, it’s such a luxury to be a student, and you have great people to interact with on a daily basis.”
Ramaswamy does admit, however, that exceptions do exist. “I could see the other side of it,” he says. “If an entrepreneur felt that really, their thing was the next thing, the next Facebook or the next Microsoft, then I could see the justification for dropping out there also.” Kosslyn says that students should consider how Harvard can fit into their lifelong objectives. “It’s not like Harvard is something worth avoiding, but I mean it depends on why you come to Harvard in the first place. If you come to Harvard to sort of learn about the world, it’s an awesome thing, some of that can also be done elsewhere,” says Kosslyn.  
IS HARVARD IN THE WAY?
Harvard’s support for entrepreneurship on campus is a relatively recent development. It has been rumored that Harvard College once had a loose and often unenforced rule that students were prohibited from running businesses out of their dorm rooms. However, the current FAS Handbook for Students vaguely states that students are allowed to partake in “modest levels of business activities on campus,” provided that they do not violate other College rules regarding residential life or use of Harvard’s name and resources.
“I used to hear that Harvard was a little more protective of its students in not entering entrepreneurship. They wanted them to shy away from it,” says Ramaswamy. “But I think that culture has really changed.”
While Harvard may be more encouraging of student startups today, there are still some improvements that could be made. As an Anthropology concentrator, Silverman says she feels that the information about entrepreneurship on campus is not always readily available to her. However, she is unsure about whether or not this is a pressing issue that the college needs to address. “I don’t feel like that’s been a barrier,” she says. “I feel like it’s just the way things have worked out.”
Some students agree that entrepreneurship is not adequately presented on campus as a viable career option. While May says that he is satisfied with the level of support he receives from the College, he admits that more resources regarding entrepreneurship would be beneficial to students in general. “Maybe if career services made a push for start-ups being an alternative line of work, besides the standard consulting and i-banking,” says May. “I think that could be beneficial to standardize it as something people think about as their career track.”
While undergraduates might appreciate their liberal arts education, Ager says that students may be unprepared to enter the workforce due to the lack of business classes at Harvard. “It’s very foolish to think that anybody could start any sort of enterprise without having some basic knowledge of accounting and finance,” he says. “Can you learn? Eventually you can. But I think that you’re at a significant disadvantage to these other students from these others schools who have these backgrounds because they understand finance, they understand how to develop a financial model for their organizations, they understand the different between a balance sheet and a cash-flow statement, which is really quite advantageous for someone starting out.”
THE NEXT STEP TO SUCCESS
Students and faculty alike agree that the college should encourage students’ business pursuits, although many are unsure of what specific approaches Harvard should take to be most helpful. Ramaswamy says he believes that Harvard should promote entrepreneurship as a potential road to success for students. Furthermore, Ramaswamy notes that running a business has been an education in and of itself. “It’s the most valuable learning experience I’ve had and I think I ever will have in any part of my academic life. There are some things that really can’t be taught in the classroom,” he says.
Others believe that care should be taken to avoid excessive encouragement of entrepreneurship on campus, arguing that it could potentially suppress the drive and spirit necessary to be a successful entrepreneur. “Is entrepreneurship something that you should shove down people’s throats? Should I have been pursued as a key future entrepreneur? No,” says Silverman. “That’s something that I had to look out for myself, I chose not to, until the time came along when I was more interested in that.”
Ager expresses a similar sentiment. “I get worried when adults interfere too much in student life and if we’re providing all these different resources for the students in a way it all of the sudden no longer makes it entrepreneurial,” he says. “I don’t think that the college should feel this obligation to provide resources to students. I think that we should make sure that we don’t create an environment where it’s not possible for students to go and access the resources that they need.”
Regardless of how much or how little the college endorses and supports its students’ entrepreneurial endeavors, it is inevitable that some undergraduates will find some way to pursue their business ventures. As Ager says, “Students are capable, I believe, of managing their time and they can, very effectively. There’s nothing this institution can do to stop them from pursuing that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parents voiced concerns about the overall quality of student life in Cambridge Public Schools during a school climate subcommittee public hearing last night—the first step in the district’s plan to refocus attention on ensuring students’ physical and emotional well-being.The meeting was prompted in part by results from a 2006 parent attitudes survey, which indicated that issues relating to school climate—including student safety, behavior, and discipline—were widespread concerns. In response, the district adopted the maintenance of a “safe, nurturing, and healthy school environment” as one of its goals for the current school year.Parents at the meeting said that while experiences with teachers were generally positive, students still reported encountering bullying and theft outside of the classroom. Most parents agreed that maintaining a positive school culture should be a major priority. “I’d rather have my kid be a nice person than pass the MCAS,” said parent Debra Gustafson.Some parents also noted that establishing a respectful school climate would require educating faculty members as well as students.“Teachers are not exempt from bad social skills,” said parent Chandra Banks.Deputy Superintendent Carolyn Turk emphasized that the district should integrate its social skills education with academics. “It’s not a matter of one more thing,” Turk said. “It shouldn’t be one more thing. It should be the thing.”Turk also told the audience that the district already has two programs, Responsive Classroom and Developmental Design, which provide teachers with a curriculum to help students learn how to behave respectfully. According to school committee member Alfred B. Fantini, use of these programs is up to the jurisdiction of individual principals, but the hope is that all schools will implement some kind of effort to address the issue.Marc C. McGovern, who chairs the subcommittee, said that there would be many more discussions on the issue, but that he and the other school committee members felt it was important to hear directly from the community first. “We’re not going to reach the academic achievement and academic goals that we want to reach if we have schools where staff and students don’t feel safe,” McGovern said. “School culture is the thread through all of the other goals that we’re trying to achieve,” he said.—Staff writer Michelle L.

Eve Mosher discussed her critically acclaimed New York City eco-art project HighWaterLine in the Gund Auditorium at the Graduate School of Design last night in an event aimed at bridging the gap between environmentalism and art.The project was aimed at highlighting the potential threat of flooding due to climate change in New York city. Using Google Maps and a chalk dispenser, Mosher drew a single chalk line through parks and public streets in the city along a 10-foot-high contour that marks the potential height of floodwaters by 2050.The project, which took six months and was completed in May 2007, piqued the interest of city-dwellers and passers-by. Mosher said that she welcomed the opportunity to talk to curious strangers about climate change.“When people encounter something in an unexpected manner, their minds fire more quickly so they are more receptive to new ideas,” she said.Mosher was joined by an interdisciplinary panel of scientists, artists, and urban planners who discussed environmental activism in their fields of expertise.Panelist Bill Fox, who is the director of the Center for Art & Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art, said that Mosher’s work is an example of how artists can instigate change on issues of global importance. “We live in a visual culture, and artists can affect how people see the world,” he said.  Mosher said she was motivated to complete this large-scale project by a desire to open up a more diverse discourse on environmentalism. “The environmental community seemed to be self-selective and not diverse,” she said. “Not socio-economically diverse, not geographically diverse, not class-diverse.”Martin Zogran, an assistant professor of urban design at the GSD, noted that the school is working to incorporate this new trend of inter-disciplinary environmentalism into its curriculum. This year, the school introduced a Sustainable Design concentration area in their Master of Design Studies program.Zenobia Meckley, a GSD student studying landscaping, said that the panel was one of many efforts that the school had of late made to engage with the environmentalist movement. “Art can play an important role in effecting change—it’s one of the most important roles that art can play,” she said.

National Free Applications for Federal Student Aid are at three million for the 2009-2010 school year, an increase of 20 percent over the same processing period last year, according to a release by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators on Friday.The government’s direct student loan program is also up by $7 billion this academic year, according to NAFSAA.The increase in applications for financial aid at Harvard maps with the national increase in FAFSA applications. This year, the number of financial aid applicants increased from 73 to 78 percent of the undergraduate population, according to Dean of Admission and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. But Harvard remains able to meet the full financial need of its students, which will total $147 million next year—an 18 percent increase from 2008-2009. Harvard’s funding for financial aid comes mostly from the endowment and other private sources, with only around five percent coming from the federal government, according to Fitzsimmons.The increase in applications is concurrent with additional education funding from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The ARRA will provide an additional $17 billion for Pell Grants in fiscal years 2009 and 2010; funding for the current fiscal year is $16.2 billion, with 6.1 million students participating. The stimulus package is also providing nearly $14 billion in tuition tax credits for middle-class families, raising the current cut from $1,800 to $2,500.“With regards to Pell grants and student loans, the funding is in place, so even though there is an increase in applications, it will have no effect on who qualifies,” said Larry Zaglaniczny, NAFSAA vice president of government affairs.According to Zaglaniczny, the only federal program that could see some shortness of funds is the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant Program, a small program administered directly to low-income students by participating colleges, Harvard being one such school. Nevertheless, as the Financial Aid Office has stated, a student’s aid package will be fully backed, even if there is a shortfall in federal funds.                                —Staff writer Jillian K.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is anticipating a potential 30 percent increase in fares for T rides if the Governor’s transportation reform bill does not pass, according to an MBTA spokesman.
The bill includes a proposed 19-cent increase to the state gas tax that would help stave off the MBTA’s projected $161 million deficit in the next fiscal year.
MBTA Spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said that while there was no specific proposal for the exact amount the fares would be raised, the price of an individual T-ride might increase from $1.70 on a Charlie Card to $2.21.
“We’ve said repeatedly that without some help to deal with our budget deficit, we’ll have to close the deficit gap down by raising fares or closing services,” Pesaturo said. “If the legislature does approve the bill, then there would be no need to raise fares.”
The MBTA’s primary source of revenue comes from the state sales tax, which has generated far less this year than predicted.
“We’re okay this fiscal year, but without the projected revenue come next July, there’s just a huge deficit we will have trouble making up,” Pesaturo said.
T riders expressed concern over the buzz surrounding the possible increase in ride prices.
“My work reimburses me, but even if [fares] don’t impact me directly, it really stinks that it might go up and up and up,” said Dallas R. Menard, who was adding money to his Charlie Card at the Harvard Square T station yesterday. 
“I mean, it was only 85 cents not so long ago,” he said.
The MBTA raised its rates in 2004 and again in 2007 to much chagrin from frequent passengers. In the summer of 2008, the MBTA board announced that there would be no fare increases until 2010 at the earliest.
Lisa M. O’Loughlin, who was entering the Harvard Square station yesterday, said that the repeated rise in ride fares has made her question the MBTA’s management of its budget.
“I follow all the news, and if their ridership hasn’t gone down as they say even though gas prices have, I want to know where all that increased ridership income is going,” she said. “The waste that is going on is unfortunate and unnecessary.”
According to Pesaturo, subway ridership dropped 2.9 percent in January.
Harvard offers a subsidy to eligible employees to purchase public transit passes from the MBTA, and there has been no word so far from the University that increased fares would change these benefits.

Wikipedia, the online open-source encyclopedia, will now allow users to drag and drop their favorite articles into book-form as part of a new partnership with a German company called PediaPress.Wikipedia and PediaPress began working together in 2007, but only earlier this year did the web-to-print service begin creating books out of German Wikipedia articles. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the venture “is doing brisk business: it sold more than 1,000 German language books in its first month of operation.”Heiko Hees, Managing Director of PediaPress, said that “many people who received books came back and ordered more.” He added that PediaPress’ goal is to create an alternative to the textbook.  A 100-page book will cost approximately $8, yet in an age of increased Internet use, many wonder whether this concept will be successful, since Wikipedia can be accessed online free of charge.“I wouldn’t spend on a book when I can go to Wikipedia online and then can go to Widener and look up whatever source was cited there,” Andrew L. Irvine ’12 said.Sara B. Cheche ’09 said, “if I wanted to give back to Wikipedia, I would make a donation, which is more cost-effective.”Alexander P. Biega ’10, however, said that publishing Wikipedia articles in book form is a “fantastic idea” that would be “easy to use for basic info.”Many in the Harvard community expressed concern over the fact that any Wikipedia user can edit the content of articles, which they say undermines its reliability in an academic setting.Stephen Pinker, an acclaimed Harvard psychology professor, said, “I think Wikipedia is a fantastic resource although I don’t allow students to use it as a source for their papers.”He added that the site is a good tool for students to use in order to orientate themselves in an area.However, Pinker said that because it lacks quality control, Wikipedia cannot be held to the same standard as scholarly journals and books.“Since the information on Wikipedia is constantly evolving, it is certainly not always accurate and I continue to caution students against using it,” said Jane Rosenzweig, director of the Writing Center.  Hees said that Wikipedia has developed many strategies to ensure quality control, and that the Web site is looking to implement a new feature that would inform visitors which articles had been checked in order to resolve some of the site’s reliability problems.

The half-hour allotted for tea and cookies before the meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences lost some of its luster yesterday.Instead of the thick, glossy paper typically used for the minutes of the past month’s Faculty meeting, the most recent documents stacked on the tables were printed on conventional thin stock.“Today is the last day you’ll see a wide variety of printed material available to us in the Faculty meeting,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in his first piece of news regarding the ongoing financial crisis.Future Faculty meetings will continue to provide some printed materials, such as the agenda, but others—such as documents related to docket items—will be available online before professors gather in University Hall.These printed documents may soon become relics of a long-gone era.The prepared packet of information was “apparently your last chance to get it on hard copy,” Molecular and Cellular Biology Professor Douglas A. Melton soberly told the Faculty when he presented a docket item. Papers rustled.IN THE DOGHOUSEIn his presentation of the report of the Task Force on the Arts, English Professor and Task Force Chair Stephen J. Greenblatt volleyed numerous faculty concerns, ranging from the need for basic painting courses to the lack of consultation with departments in the writing of the report.But Professor of Christian Morals Peter J. Gomes had music on his mind—namely the dulcet tones of the choir that sings in Memorial Church every Sunday. After Greenblatt’s presentation, Gomes raised the possibility of rewarding the work of student performers and artists with academic credit.“Is it unthinkable? Have you given any thought to this?” Gomes asked as he waved a copy of the crimson report near his head.Greenblatt observed that students already had opportunities to create works of art for academic credit in departments like visual and environmental studies. But the proposal to extend academic recognition to all artistic endeavors would require serious pedagogical considerations, Greenblatt said, though he added that the suggestion was not “unthinkable.”“I am delighted to hear it,” Gomes said. “This is a room full of old dogs and these are some new tricks that you’re proposing to teach.”PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS?Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 raised the possibility that “already overstressed demands on the infrastructure” would cause the University to divert resources from already existing artistic endeavors on campus.But Tom Conley, professor of romance languages and literature and visual and environmental studies, stood with arms akimbo at the podium and sought to allay Lewis’ concerns.“‘Art is born of constraint, and it dies of liberty,’” Conley recited in French. “I hope that this will soften...your remarks to some extent.”—Staff writer Bonnie J.

Physicist Cherry A. Murray has been selected as the Dean of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, effective July 1, 2009.Murray, who is currently the principal associate director for science and technology at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, will also be appointed the John A. and Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences.The selection was announced to SEAS faculty in an e-mail sent yesterday afternoon, according to Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, a professor of physics at SEAS who served as dean for a decade. He was succeeded in the interim by Applied Physics professor Frans A. Spaepen.“It’s just delightful she’s decided to come,” said Venky. “I am really happy she will be succeeding me as Dean.”Venky, who stepped down as dean last year after spearheading an effort to transform SEAS from a division to a school, said in an interview last year that the next phase of SEAS—turning it into a “model engineering school aimed at the broadly educated”—would be a “ten year job.”Venky and several SEAS faculty members said that Murray was a “fantastic” choice to take the reins for this transition because of her broad scientific and managerial experiences and “visionary” outlook.“She has the achievements as a scientist herself, but also has the broad perspective of scientific issues both nationally and internationally,” said Evelyn Hu, a professor of applied physics and electrical engineering at SEAS.After receiving her undergraduate and doctoral degrees in physics from MIT, Murray went to work at Bell Labs, where she started as a staff scientist in 1978, and eventually became senior vice president. There, she worked alongside many current SEAS faculty.“I have to disclose everything,” said Federico Capasso, a professor of applied physics at SEAS who served on the advisory committee for the SEAS dean search. “She was my boss at Bell Labs, and partly because I know her so well, I think she’s an absolutely terrific choice from every angle.”After working at Bell, Murray went to the Lawrence Livermore National Labs in 2004, a nuclear security laboratory managed by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC for the National Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy.Her years of experience in both positions have given her a “unique breadth of experience” in managing both research and industrial labs, Capasso said. “She is a world-class scientist, capable of managing from basic science and applied research to talking to business units and handling communications,” he added.Murray is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is serving as president of the American Physical Society this year.Her research focuses on three subjects: light scattering, in which photons are fired at an object of interest; surface physics, which studies phenomena that occur at the interface of two phases; and complex fluids that have properties of different phases.She has published over 70 peer-reviewed articles, served on more than 80 scientific advisory committees, holds two patents, and was named one of the “50 Most Important Women in Science” by Discover magazine in 2002.“You don’t get that kind of recognition just for doing average work,” said Capasso. “She is, I would say, in a class by herself.”He apologized for interrupting his interview with The Crimson when another colleague walked into his office. “We were just sharing our joy,” said Capasso.This sentiment seemed to be shared by other SEAS faculty.“I can’t be happier with anybody else who would be considered,” said Joanna Aizenberg, a professor of materials science at SEAS.Murray could not be reached for comment last night.—Staff writer Alissa M.

Singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles will be performing at the College’s fourth annual Yardfest on April 19, the College Events Board announced last night.The Grammy nominee will be followed by New York City electronic music group Ratatat, comprising Mike Stroud on guitar and Evan Mast on synthesizer.The group is known for its original instrumental compositions in addition to its sampled hip-hop remixes.“We have never had a big electronic band come to Yardfest in the past, so it’s something new,” said CEB Chair Kevin M. Mee ’10.Bareilles, a California native and UCLA graduate, is best known for her single “Love Song,” which reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 last year.Last fall, the CEB conducted a poll to gauge the genres students most wished to see at Yardfest. Despite receiving over 3,000 responses, Mee said the survey primarily showed the CEB the variety of musical interests within the student body.Speculation arose earlier this semester that 90s pop-rock band Eve 6 would be performing at Yardfest after the group posted a Harvard tour date on their Web site. After the Eve 6 rumor broke, CEB fielded numerous comments from students who expressed a desire to see Ratatat and Bareilles instead, Mee said. Mee said that the group had contacted Eve 6 to see if they would be available to perform, but they “were never officially considering Eve 6.”The concert, which will be open to Harvard undergraduates, will take place on a Sunday this year, as opposed to last year’s Saturday performance. Mee said he does not expect the Sunday date to affect turnout, as the concert was held on Sunday in its first iteration and still saw a large turnout. He added that it should be over by 9 p.m.Last year, pop-rock artist Gavin DeGraw and hip-hop group the Wu-Tang Clan performed on the steps of Memorial Church to a crowd of over 7,000. Mee said he expected the turnout to be similar this year.—Staff writer Lauren D.

Even when their wallets are thin, people will always need to eat—and despite the economic crisis, they might still be willing to spring for their favorite restaurant’s seared hanger steak with a glass of red wine.Considering that the Square’s eateries are part of an industry that depends almost entirely on disposable income, they have been keeping their heads above water in the economic recession. Owners reported a few dips and changes in business patterns, but overall, they remain optimistic.Business on Tuesday and Wednesday nights—never a restaurant’s money-making time—has been in decline. Some eateries said that diners have been spending less on average while regulars have been dropping in less frequently. But on weekends, restaurants are still packed—and alcohol sales have been resilient.The key to riding out the recession, according Paul D. Consorti, president and co-founder of Finale, is flexibility, something which Square restaurants have demonstrated by offering specials and extra attentive service.CASE BY CASE BASISBut despite their concerted efforts, Square restaurants say the economy has taken its toll on business.“We haven’t been immune,” Consorti said.The recession has not been equal in dampening business—expensive eateries have been hit harder and casual sit-down chains have seen sales slide dramatically, while more adaptable, locally-owned restaurants have been faring better.“I’ve been hearing mostly bad news from casual dining chains,” Consorti said. “Local restaurants with local followings are doing well. Even the high end restaurants...it’s kind of on a case by case basis.”“It’s more on the Tuesday, Wednesday night time frame,” he said, adding, “The weekends are still very busy.”Though the Square has been riding out the recession without too much difficulty, the broader restaurant industry is weathering a rough climate, with diners cutting back on the number of visits, ordering less when they come in, and cooking at home much more often.Sales for cookbooks and cooking utensils have gone up, while many restaurants have had to shut their doors. “It’s been very tough,” said Jerome R. Picca, co-owner of Small Plates. “Talking to a lot of my friends who either own restaurants or manage restaurants or are thinking of opening a restaurant, what they’re talking about is that their sales are down from 20 to 50 percent.” He said that the biggest casualty has been high-end restaurants, particularly ones that opened recently and have not had time to develop loyal customer bases.Small Plates’ opening coincided with the beginning of the recession in late 2007, unfortunate timing that the tapas restaurant has been recovering from.“[Reservations] did go down definitely in the fall,” Picca said, adding that they have “picked up a little bit since the beginning of the year.”At Henrietta’s Table in the Charles Hotel, executive chef Peter W. Davis said that business is “a little bit slower,” but the drop has not been dramatic.On the other hand, Christopher T. Principe, general manager of Cambridge 1—a casual sit-down restaurant known for their thin-crust pizzas—said, “We haven’t felt too much of a loss. We’re still surviving over there.”The restaurant hasn’t seen bill figures going down, either. But in places where diners are now spending less, collateral damage is felt throughout the ranks.Chez Henri, a Porter Square restaurant that offers French and Cuban food, has seen diners ordering less. Dining room manager, Christy Leveroni said her conversations with servers have revealed that times are tough.“They’re not thrilled,” she said.SUNNY IN A SNOWSTORMAlthough most Square restaurants reported at least a small dip in their business, Ten Tables, which opened its Cambridge location last month, has not been negatively affected by the downturn.“We actually got busier,” chef and co-owner Krista Kranyak said of Ten Tables’ Jamaica Plain location. She attributed the uptick in business to pricing, since Ten Tables is positioned to be a more affordable alternative to older sit-down restaurants.Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, attributed good business to creativity and dedication on restaurants’ part.She pointed out that many restaurants have been participating enthusiastically in Square promotional events—for instance, some chefs have been willing to get up early to flip pancakes for breakfast events.“These people are really committed to making sure people come to the Square,” she said.HSBA’s Restaurant Committee has been active in thinking up new ways to cross-promote the well-being of Square eateries at large. Jillson said that the most clicked-on link on the well-trafficked Harvard Square homepage has been the Square restaurants page.At the upscale Upstairs on the Square, business has been good, possibly even a little better. “You are seeing people ordering more,” director of operations Matthew C. Lishanky said. “In terms of the food, people are always going to be drawn to great food on any menu.”Most restaurants reported that alcohol sales have been one constant in a uncertain landscape.Om Restaurant and Lounge, an Asian fusion restaurant with a focus on after-hours nightlife, has been moving its signature aromatherapy cocktails at a steady clip, despite an otherwise very slow winter, Event Coordinator Leah E. Horgan said.“The bar has been steady. That’s something people are seeing all around,” Horgan said.Across the street, Upstairs on the Square has been no different.“People are definitely still drinking lots of wine, and lots of cocktails,” Lishanky said. “Alcohol sales have probably been on the rise, if there’s anything to numb the pain.”In addition, every restaurant interviewed reported a strong Valentine’s Day weekend, as diners spent with abandon and tipped generously.“What we’ve seen as a trend overall in restaurants is that people are still doing the special occasions and the Saturday nights,” said Michael J. Mooney, the general manager of Rialto, an Italian restaurant that ranks among the Square’s swankiest.But weeknight business is another story.“Less people are going out on Monday and Tuesday for dinner,” Mooney said, adding that diners who come in “are spending less.”THE SMALL THINGSIn the recession, even the most expensive restaurants are pulling out all the stops to let customers know that they appreciate their business—lowering prices and offering specials to allow their patrons to indulge while economizing.And diners are taking advantage of cheaper alternatives, such as moderately-priced bar menus in high-end restaurants. In addition, the are gravitating towards fixed price specials offered by eateries eager to lure in bargain diners.“We can only control what happens in the restaurant,” said Harvest General Manager Ivan T. Law. “The experience is what we can control.” For Om, change has meant offering more specials and deals.“We adjusted our prices,” Horgan said. “We try to be accommodating.”At Small Plates, Picca said he sees students order a lunchtime sandwich while catching up on their coursepack readings—something which he encourages, although high-end restaurants usually frown upon loitering patrons.At Chez Henri, business has been just fine, according to Leveroni.They haven’t made changes to the menu; rather, it’s about what hasn’t changed.“What we haven’t done is put up prices in the last 7 years,” she said.Harvest, which serves high-end New England cuisine, has lost out on much of its usual corporate dining due to company budget cutbacks and firms going under. But on the other hand, the cheaper menu options have been getting more traffic.“We definitely see more bar business,” Law said.—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

The Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology will offer a new undergraduate concentration in human development this fall—among the first of its kind at a national university.
The concentration in Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology will focus on the development, aging, and regeneration of the human body. It marks Harvard’s seventh new concentration in the life sciences in the past three years, representing another step in the further undergraduate specialization in the life sciences at the University.
In his presentation at yesterday’s Faculty meeting, Molecular and Cellular Biology Professor Douglas A. Melton emphasized that HDRB will not be a vocational concentration designed for pre-med students.
“It’s a fundamental life science concentration with the focus on the human organism,” he told the Faculty.
“The concentration, simply put, is about how humans develop,” he added. “How does a fertilized egg turn into an embryo, turn into a fetus, turn into an adult?” 
Although Melton argued that the new concentration is not preprofessional, many HDRB classes will be taught next fall by Medical School professors. The SCRB department—itself a joint venture of FAS and Harvard Medical School, begun in 2007—is currently offering courses that will count toward the nascent concentration’s requirements.
The undergraduate study of biology at Harvard has grown increasingly specialized over the past three years, with Harvard now offering nine life science concentrations—including HDRB—as of next fall.
Harvard is still in the process of phasing out its own biology and biochemical sciences concentrations, which the Faculty voted to eliminate in favor of six more specialized fields in the spring of 2006.
Melton said that he hopes HDRB will bridge the gap between the existing human evolutionary biology and molecular and cellular biology concentrations.
He told The Crimson yesterday that he believed undergraduates prefer finding their home in smaller concentrations under the Life Sciences umbrella.
Harvard’s seven recently created life science concentrations are the only non-engineering concentrations that have been created at Harvard College since 1992. 
HDRB will emphasize hands-on research under the guidance of faculty affiliated with the department, according to Melton, who will co-tutor the concentration with stem cell researcher Kevin Eggan.
The new concentration has been in the works for over a year, according to MCB professor Robert A. Lue, who was an active participant in the discussions surrounding the creation of HDRB.
The approval of the new concentration comes on the heels of the recent passage of President Barack Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package—a boon for stem cell researchers who are now eligible for some of the $10.4 billion earmarked for the National Institutes of Health, typically a generous source of federal funding for biomedical researchers at Harvard.  
The current freshmen class will be the first that will be able to declare a concentration in HDRB.

Members of the Chinese Students Association discovered racially charged messages posted on the walls of the Lowell House Grille after a graffiti-themed party Friday night, prompting a wave of anger and frustration within Harvard’s Chinese community.Party-goers were encouraged to write phrases on strips of tape and paper in glow-in-the-dark highlighters. But after the party’s conclusion, students discovered inflammatory writings such as “Chinese people perform genocide” and “Chinese people suck” written on the walls.“I think outrageous would be a good adjective to describe it,” said Daniel C. Suo ’10, co-president of the CSA.CSA board members have not identified the student or students responsible for the writings, but many noted that finding them may prove to be impossible.“We had hundreds of people who came in the room that [night] so it would be really hard to find out who it was,” said CSA co-Vice President Lisa M. Yu ’11.The incident in Lowell Grille follows another Ivy League incident in which disparaging comments were aimed at the Asian American community.Last week, a popular Dartmouth e-mail list-serve, “Generic Good Morning Message,” sent an e-mail to hundreds of students laced with racist remarks about the University’s newly appointed president, Harvard Medical School Professor Jim Yong Kim, who is South Korean. The Asian American Association’s recent marketing of the “Mr. Asian Sensation” male beauty pageant also stoked controversy on the Kirkland House e-mail list. Some students said that the pageant was offensive because it presumed that non-Asian participants would be excluded.The organization has already responded to the incident by reaching out to the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations with the intention of creating a forum for student groups to discuss the issue.“It’s odd for something like this to hit so close to home,” said Felix M. Zhang ’11, CSA co-vice president. “Its kind of disconcerting and a little disappointing.” “In the spirit of President Obama’s speech about a post-racial society, it may be interesting for us to reflect on our own colleges like Harvard and Dartmouth,” he added.

Versatility is usually not the first skill for a college baseball player to boast about.However, junior Dan Zailskas has proven that his flexibility to play just about anywhere on the field is one of his most important contributions to the team.“[Zailskas] is the guy that we can always count on on the mound, and the guy whose versatility can fit anywhere in the lineup,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh comments. “I don’t think that Dan cares where he is in the lineup, or where he’s playing, but he cares about helping the team.”The Marshfield, Mass., native has shown flashes of greatness since freshman year, but already this season, Zailskas has made it clear that he is ready to take the field every day, both at first base and as a pitcher. “We have so many talented players,” Zailskas says. “And since my freshman year I’ve been battling to get in the lineup. It has helped being able to play multiple positions.”After almost tripling his innings pitched from freshman year to sophomore year and increasing his number of games started in the lineup, Zailskas has grown into his role as a utilityman and has shown himself worthy of a spot on the diamond, whether it is on or off the mound.“Since his freshman year, you can see that he has become much stronger physically and he has also developed a solid approach to the game,” captain Harry Douglas says.And unlike many baseball players at this high level, Zailskas is not only willing to play anywhere, but has proven his ability to make an impact wherever the coaches tell him to go. “He is such a good athlete, he played three sports in high school,” Walsh says.  “He’s just one of those guys that says ‘hey coach, put me anywhere I can help the team.’”So where exactly does Zailskas fit best into the picture?The Crimson has thrown the junior into the fray not only as a pitcher, but at third base, shortstop, and at first, where he has emerged as one of the team’s most solid defensive players. And for Zailskas, any of these opportunities to play the sport he loves has its highlights.“There is nothing as satisfying as striking someone out, but at the same time playing first base and making a great play or hitting the ball hard is pretty satisfying as well,” he says.Already in this young season, Zailskas has seen his hard work and willingness to move around the diamond make him an asset, with a solid performance in the team’s opening weekend against Jacksonville State.Of the four games in Alabama, Zailskas started three of them at first base, and made an appearance on the mound. In the season opener, Zailskas provided Harvard with its lone run in a 1-4 loss for the Crimson, belting a home run in the eighth inning.The third-year player turned around the next morning to notch two RBI and a run in the second game, in addition to pitching three innings.  A well-deserved rest had Zailskas watching game three, allowing him to return vigorously for the Harvard win in game four, scoring a run and a collecting his fourth RBI on the weekend.“It was great to see the hard work pay off,” Zailskas reflects. “I’ve been working hard all year and came right out of the gates, and hopefully it will continue for the rest of the year.”With a white-hot start the junior has shown he can make a difference for the Crimson on the field and in the lineup, but for Zailskas’ teammates, his personality stands out as much as his performance.“Zailskas’ attitude and intensity are his greatest attributes,” Douglas praises.  “He’s fearless and he wants to win, whether he’s on the mound or at the plate.”After the team compiled a record last season that would have left a sour aftertaste in most—ending at 10-30—it seems as though a veteran with so much intensity and a desire to reverse Harvard’s fortune will be a key component in bringing more success to the team this year.  Zailskas’ fearless attitude, his talent that spans the entire field, and his team-first mentality ensure that the Crimson will not lapse into the same pattern of last season.Although Harvard’s record from the weekend does not speak to the squad’s impressive showing, with Zailskas and others sparking the offensive effort the Crimson has much to be enthusiastic about for the remainder of the season.“We have an extremely talented line-up with a bunch of guys who can put the ball in play,” Zailskas says.  “I’m not the kind of guy that is going to hit 20 home runs or have 10 strikeouts a game.  But I can help the team best if I can just do the little things right, like loading base runners, playing well in the field and getting the outs that we need when I pitch.”So far this season the junior has performed all of his tasks flawlessly.If Zailskas keeps up his level of play, the problem won’t be whether to start the utility player, but where to put him in the field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 60-minute game can come down to just one second. This was the case for Harvard women’s lacrosse yesterday, when, with one second left on the clock sophomore Jessica Halpern fired the ball into the back of the net, bringing the Crimson back into the game with a score of 9-9 and forcing the contest into overtime.Harvard women’s lacrosse battled to the last whistle yesterday against No.13 New Hampshire on Cumnock Turf. In a relentless and resilient effort by the Crimson (2-2), Harvard barely fell to the Wildcats (5-1). At the end of regulation play, the Crimson was tied with New Hampshire 9-9 but came up short 9-11 in a series of two three-minute overtimes. “We were really excited and really pumped up, and I don’t think they expected us to be as competitive as we were today,” freshman Tyler Petropulous said.The wildcats came out with enthusiasm in the beginning of the game, with senior Sarah Van Bargen recording two goals within the first minute of play. Harvard dug itself out, though, with goals by senior Kaitlin Martin and sophomore Jess Halpern to tie the game. Throughout the game, the score was tied six times.At halftime the score was 5-7 as the Crimson found itself down by two goals. Freshman goalie Kerry Clarke came up big in the second half with crucial saves, allowing Harvard to focus on its offense, and the Crimson soon led the Wildcats 8-7 with eleven minutes left in regulation. “Clarke came up with a bunch of amazing saves.” Halpern said. “She was very good at making saves and clearing the ball really quickly so we could get it to our flanks and attack at speed.”But Harvard had some trouble in its offensive zone with turnovers, and New Hampshire capitalized on the Crimson’s unforced errors with lightning quick counters up the field. Harvard was able to hold off the Wildcat onslaught for a while with good defensive cover and colossal saves by Clarke. But after a series of nice passes and quality possessions by UNH, the Wildcats scored to bring the game to an 8-8 tie. Harvard did not let down and kept the pressure on the Wildcats, but New Hampshire equaled the Crimson’s intensity in a back-and-forth battle. Van Barger split two Harvard defenders with a spin move and beat Clarke low to establish a one-goal lead 8-9 for UNH.With two minutes left in the contest, Harvard needed to win possession to have a chance at winning the game. In the last minute of play, the Crimson finally found the ball and ran to goal. “When we were down 9-8 with two and a half minutes left, UNH had the ball almost playing keep away,” Halpern said, “but Tyler Petropulous got the ball [from the Wildcats] with a minute left to give us the drive to tie the game.”Shortly after Petropolous dished to one of her teammates, UNH committed a foul with nine seconds left, awarding Harvard an eight meter shot. The shot went wide, but Halpern regained possession to score in the last second of regulation.After a five-minute break, the match jumped into the two extra frames, where the Crimson hoped to capitalize on its newly found energy.“We wanted to carry the momentum from the end of the game into the last six minutes.” Halpern said. “We wanted to stay composed and not force any shorts or cause careless turnovers.”Less than two minutes in, Harvard committed a costly foul, and UNH converted its eight meter shot to make the score 9-10. Immediately off the restart, Petropulous won control of the draw, placing Harvard in great position to finish the first overtime. Martin took the last shot with three seconds left, but ultimately did not put it away.In the next three-minute segment, Petropulous controlled the draw again, but the Wildcats overpowered the Crimson, adding an insurance goal with only ten seconds left to seal the match.The hard-fought game against such a highly ranked opponent left Harvard optimistic and looking forward to the rest of the season.“We were solid all around,” Petropulous said, “and those little things that we missed are what we need to work on, but overall we worked together as a team and that is what will make us successful later on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An early goal taken away on a questionable call. A miss on a wide-open net and several hit posts. A game-ending goal in overtime off a hard, but by no means blazing shot from distance that junior goalie Christina Kessler saves nine times out of ten.
With these and other extraordinary factors conspiring against the then-No. 7 Harvard women’s hockey team in its stunning 3-2 upset loss to Rensselaer in Saturday’s ECAC Tournament semifinals, it’s no wonder that Crimson coach Katey Stone invoked hidden deities and suggested that fate was at work in her postgame press conference.
“I think the hockey gods were favoring [the Engineers] today,” Stone said. “It might have just been their day and not ours.”
Skeptics might point out other, more tangible culprits responsible for the loss that undermined Harvard’s recent dominance over its conference opponents and kept the team out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2002. They might look to an irresponsible Crimson penalty for having too many players on the ice that set up the power play in which RPI scored the game-ending goal.  They might credit Engineer goalie Sonja van der Bliek for playing the game of her life, registering a career-high 48 saves to lead her team to the tourney’s final round.
But whether Harvard was on the wrong side of destiny, had bad luck, or was simply outplayed, there was just something that didn’t feel right—not only about this game, but about the entire season as well.
In my three years on the women’s hockey beat, every Crimson campaign that I’ve covered has ended in heartbreaking fashion.
Facing top-ranked Wisconsin in 2007 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the underdog Harvard squad took the Badgers to four excruciating overtimes before finally succumbing to defeat in the 128th minute of play.
In 2008, the Crimson cruised into the NCAA Frozen Four in Duluth, Minn. with a 32-1-0 record and ranked No.1 in the nation, but saw its historic run snapped unceremoniously by the same Wisconsin team in a 4-1 rout.
And now there’s this year’s loss to the Engineers, in which top-seeded Harvard shockingly found itself down, 2-0, but then clawed its way back and forced overtime, only to see its comeback efforts nullified by a Laura Gersten slap shot in sudden death.
But there’s this feeling I just can’t shake, a discomfort with placing this season in the same company as the previous two.
While all three campaigns ended in devastation, there was a sense of satisfaction to salvage from the rubble of the first two that is just not there this time around.
In the 2006-07 season, Harvard was consistently among the top ten teams in the country, even reaching as high as No. 4 in the rankings at one point. But while the Crimson won nearly all of its games against inferior opponents, the team could not thrust itself into the top-tier of national powerhouses, finishing 0-5-2 against squads ranked sixth or higher.
So when Harvard was selected to the NCAA Tournament with No. 1 Wisconsin as its first-round opponent, not too many people thought the game was worth the plane ticket to Madison.
But the Crimson took the Badgers to hell and back in one of college hockey’s classic battles, and nearly sent the eventual national champions packing before their time. Harvard goalie Brittany Martin, then a sophomore, tied a school record with 67 saves in that game while her teammates exhausted every inch of their bodies’ capabilities to try and come away with a win. Wisconsin ended up eking out a victory, but the Crimson returned to Cambridge with nothing to regret and everything to be proud of.
Harvard set a markedly different tone last season, enjoying high points throughout the year before navigating a similar journey to disappointment.
The Crimson burst out of the gate with an 11-0-0 start and a meteoric rise to the top of the national rankings. After a setback against New Hampshire, Harvard rolled again, sweeping the Beanpot, ECAC Regular Season, and ECAC Tournament titles while going undefeated for the rest of the regular season and through the first round of the NCAA tourney. Current tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, always respected for her uncanny scoring abilities, became an all-around juggernaut, tallying 26 goals and 36 assists while terrorizing opponents on defense in a transcendent campaign.
Harvard was dropped in the Frozen Four by its nemesis Badgers, but nothing could take away from what the Crimson had accomplished. As a fitting tribute to the squad’s incredible season, Vaillancourt received the Patty Kazmaier Award—given to the best player in college women’s hockey—the night after the loss to the Badgers, with her entire team present to support her.
After two remarkable seasons that carried the Harvard skaters through such a wide emotional spectrum, this current Crimson group had a tough act to follow.
On its own, Harvard’s 2008-09 campaign—which saw the team sputter through mediocrity early on but recover to go on a late tear and steal the ECAC regular season crown in the last weekend of play—was certainly impressive.
Saturday’s loss to RPI—in which senior Sarah Wilson returned from illness to single-handedly resurrect the Crimson’s victory aspirations with a pair of goals before the Engineers prematurely dashed such hopes—was certainly full of drama.
But a former No. 1 team that returned all but one of its starters shouldn’t have had early struggles in the first place, nor should the top seed in the ECAC Tournament have found itself in a 2-0 hole at home to a squad that barely finished over .500 against conference opponents. 
I hate to admit it, but in a chain of captivating and enthralling seasons for Harvard, this one—whether intelligently designed by the hockey gods or randomly selected by bad luck and untimely mistakes—was the missing link.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
It appears there are some out there who have yet to truly grasp the essence of the VOID.  Worry not, we've only just begun.  But for more insight, this trailer captures the spirit quite well.
Pondering what to think about the Yardfest performers?  First of all, if you're a skeptic, give Sara Bareilles a chance.  Important people think she's pretty legit.  At the very least, learn the lyrics to her popular song.  You remember, the funnest part of 3EB was singing along to the two songs you knew with everyone else.
And FlyBy is sure you noticed that it's all the really cool people that are most excited about Ratatat.  Social proof, folks...its worth your time to dig in to some of their stuff.  While the VOID may not be the altered state of mind you're looking for when listening to Ratatat, we insist their creativity will be a better sound than that deathly silence all around you. O_O

We at FlyBy didn't really "get" the senior gift video the first time we saw it.  Sure, we got that a litany of senior "campus figures" (our own leader and design chair emeriti among them) seemed to be able to convince themselves of two contradictory conclusions over the course of about four minutes (three too many).  We got that nearly-assassinated former UC presidential candidate Michael Koenigs was the best of the bunch for entertainment value.  We even got that it's not the easiest thing in the world to cheese it up in a video that will be widely viewed and "analyzed closely" (that's what this blog does, right?), so we give the seniors some props. But what was the point? What is Sorrento? Were we missing some reference that made this all hilarious and wonderful?
Yes and no.  The video apparently refers to a five-month-old celebrity-laden youtube video that implored citizens to not vote, and then decided that hey, yeah, you should vote. Tricky! The senior video definitely nailed the slightly preachy tone that we thought only Hollywood stars had down, but left out Sarah Silverman's under-the-shirt bra removal.  For shame, '09. More after the jump.
We have to ask if there was something more timely to make fun of...we feel like someone got excited about this idea in November and wouldn't budge.  And we're all for parodies being a couple of months old, at most.  We should have felt more lame and out of touch for not getting it, and instead we just felt a bit awkward.
By the way, in case the message was not clear, seniors, please give. Our takeaway from the video was that all donations go directly to the Queen's Head, and we endorse that purpose wholeheartedly. Next year we'll do a parody of "I'm on a boat" and call it even.

Here at FlyBlyBlog, there are few things we love more than stalking members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. And the Internet makes it so easy! For our inaugural prof stalking post, we follow Baker Professor of Economics Martin Feldstein, the former president of the National Bureau of Economic Research on his travels around the world. Well, actually just to India on a NBER-sponsored trip in 2005.
Times were good for Marty back in '05. President of NBER, a rumored contender for Chairman of the Federal Reserve, board member of leading insurer AIG. And then things went south--like Marty on his India trip! Check out the pics here.
