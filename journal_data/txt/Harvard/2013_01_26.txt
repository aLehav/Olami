During my first semester of college I constantly talked about New York. I told everyone who would listen about my favorite Indian restaurant, about the Astroturf field behind my high school where we ate lunch (even on 20-degree days), about the East Village community garden where I wiled away hot summer afternoons.
That first semester, I sometimes walked around the neighborhood where I went to high school using Google Street View, zooming in as close as I could on the storefront of Heaven’s Hot Bagel, hoping to see blurry pixelated me sitting by the window. I never found myself, but I found two of my friends walking down East Houston. J. in her army surplus jacket and bright orange heels, R. in all black, hair still long like high school was still in session. I remembered that day. It was maybe the last week before finals. Walking to her house that afternoon, R. and I saw the Google van driving up her block. Two wiry-bodied soccer boys we knew were chasing the van, making faces and waving their arms. R. and I laughed and laughed. Later, sitting on my twin extra long bed in Greenough, I understood the urge to be frozen onto the streets of the city in digital film and wished I’d chased the van, too.
Before long, I was in New York again. Winter break, summer break. The city kept me busy. I would rush between internships and appointments. By the time I was settled into my routine, I was off again, back to Cambridge.
This December, I came home for a few weeks with nothing to do and all of the city to see. My second day back, I found myself caught in a dense crowd on Fifth Avenue, a block from Rockefeller Center. The throngs of holiday shoppers pushed me to the edge of the curb with the force of a great wave. New York didn’t feel like mine to command anymore. And it seemed a crueler city than I remembered. Mothers snapped at their wailing children. Subway doors snapped shut on the arms of desperate passengers, late for work. Men with sunken eyes lay sleeping in the tunnels under Penn Station on Christmas Day.
My last week in the city, I ventured to Queens to visit MoMA PS1 with a friend. When we left at closing time, 6 p.m., the sky was dark and rain was falling. What next? Arepas in Astoria. Should we take the train? No, we could walk the 27 minutes (according to Google Maps). We passed under elevated subway tracks at Queens Plaza, where steam rose from gratings and cars blocked crosswalks like malevolent, growling beasts. Around the corner, an orchid warehouse. The doors of a fish market were painted with underwater seascapes, full of bright pink starfish and neon green anemones. My friend swore he saw a DeLorean parked on the side of the road. This was uncharted territory, and it was anything but scary. As we took our seats, dripping wet, we couldn’t stop smiling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two free throws from Dartmouth’s Malik Gill boosted his team’s lead to 13 with 3:49 to play in Saturday’s contest, the heavily-favored Harvard men’s basketball team appeared to be headed for its first loss to the Big Green since 2009.
And when the Crimson found itself still trailing by double digits with fewer than two minutes to go, a bleak outcome seemed all but certain.
But co-captain Christian Webster had other plans.
The senior's nine points on three-of-three shooting from deep in the final few minutes of the game helped the Crimson (10-6, 2-0 Ivy) come back to force overtime and eventually claim a dramatic victory over Dartmouth (4-12, 0-2), 82-77, at Lavietes Pavilion.
“You need to be lucky in those situations, and luck was on our side,” Webster said. “We just made plays that they didn’t make. But all the credit to them. They should have won the game.”
With 1:33 to play, Webster got the ball at the top of the key and released his first of three long-range attempts in the final stretch. The shot found the bottom of the net, pulling the Crimson to within seven.
After the Big Green's Gabas Maldunas botched the front end of a one-and-one, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard attempted a three and was fouled at the other end. His two points at the stripe pushed the score to 57-52 with 1:11 left to play.
“A lot of things can happen in a minute and a half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “You’re just trying to see. You’re playing it out. That’s what we do.”
Thanks to two more treys from Webster in the final minute of the game, four points from freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, and four missed Dartmouth free throws down the stretch, Harvard knotted the game at 62 on a Chambers layup with 18 seconds remaining in the contest. The Big Green had a chance to win on its final possession, but Gill missed a long three to send the contest into overtime.
In the extra period, Harvard came out strong, and a Rivard long ball gave the Crimson its first advantage since it led, 2-0, in the opening minutes of the game. Though Dartmouth began to find its shooting stride at the end of the extra period, it was too little too late for the Big Green. Dartmouth got within four on a three by John Golden at the 1:05 mark, but the Crimson was able to close out the contest from the line, knocking down 12 of 13 free throws in the final two minutes of play.
“Our kids believed in it,” Amaker said. “It was an incredible shot in the arm for our team to be in that position [in overtime]. I thought we had the confidence as the game went down the stretch to pull through.”
The Big Green came out strong on Saturday, knocking down six of its  first eight shots to claim a 12-4 advantage with 15:33 to play in the  half. And though Harvard pulled within five as late as 2:28, Dartmouth  was able to stretch the advantage back to nine and went into the break up, 29-20, after a half in which the Crimson committed 12 turnovers.
Early in the second half, Harvard cut the Big Green’s lead to five with 17:14 to play on an and-one by sophomore wing Wesley Saunders. But Dartmouth pushed its advantage back up to 10 less than two minutes later.
“It’s tough being in a position like Dartmouth is right now,” Amaker said. “They played their hearts out and deserved to win.”
With the exception of sophomore forward Jonah Travis, who had 10 points in the first half on 4-of-5 shooting, Harvard struggled from the field in the opening frame, making just seven of its 21 shots on the half. The Crimson’s top three scorers—Saunders, Chambers, and Rivard—combined for just six points in the period.
But by the game's end, Chambers led the Crimson with 21 points while Saunders chipped in with 20 and Travis added 16.
John Golden and Gill led the Big Green with 15 points, while Connor Boehm scored 14.
“In a lot of ways, we didn’t deserve to win it,” Amaker said. “But we had an opportunity to see if we could steal it, and I thought it was obvious that we did some incredible things down the stretch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 2 Harvard women’s ice hockey team followed up the Crimson men’s basketball team’s remarkable comeback with a come-from-behind, overtime win of their own Saturday, defeating St. Lawrence, 3-2, in Canton, N.Y.
A day after Clarkson snapped Harvard’s 11-game unbeaten streak, the Crimson (17-2-1, 14-1-0 ECAC) did not own a lead at any point in the game until junior forward Kalley Armstrong powered the puck past Saints’ goaltender Carmen MacDonald with less than three minutes remaining in the extra frame.
“This was a tough win for us,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It was good for us to get back on track.”
The Crimson trailed by no more than one goal the entire game but never led in regulation. Things did not look promising for Harvard as St. Lawrence’s Kayla Raniwsky deflected a slap shot from teammate Dayle Wilkinson to put the Saints up, 2-1, with 11 minutes remaining in regulation.
But in the final minutes, the Crimson appeared determined not to leave its weekend in New York with two losses.
“We certainly did not come all the way out there to get swept,” Fry said. “I think we really just picked it up and started dominating the game.”
Following St. Lawrence’s second goal, Harvard controlled the possession, as Fry and co-captain Jillian Dempsey peppered MacDonald with shots. Dempsey and Fry led all skaters with ten and nine shots, respectively.
“I saw us stand up to the play, holding the blue line defensively and trying to be more aggressive,” Stone said.
Dempsey finally broke through with 6:18 left on the clock. Harvard’s leading scorer squeezed a shot from the top of the crease past MacDonald’s pads off of a centering feed from sophomore defender Michelle Picard.
“[Dempsey’s] goal was her just going hard to the net,” Fry said. “That was just what we needed.”
In overtime, St. Lawrence (13-9-2, 8-3-1 ECAC) called timeout with three minutes left to play. Off the ensuing faceoff in the Saints’ zone, sophomore defender Sarah Edney rang a shot off the post. In the scramble in front of the net to recover the puck, Fry found an open Armstrong in the slot for the game-winner.
“The thing I love about that [goal] is that our kids, they were in the right spots, dying to score,” Stone said. “They were hungry; they were all over the net, which we weren’t on Friday night.”
In the second period, overlapping hooking minors from Hillary Crowe and Kaitlin Spurling required the Crimson to kill off 1:46 of a 5-on-3 Saints power play. The two teams remained scoreless through 35 minutes.
“We were trying to be too cute, honestly,” Stone said of her team’s play early in the game. “We were trying to make perfect plays and then get the puck to the net. We over-passed and didn’t get the puck on net like we typically do.”
Abbey McRae of St. Lawrence opened the scoring with less than five minutes remaining in the second period. But Harvard forward Mary Parker responded less than two minutes later, converting a turnover behind the Saints’ net into a wrap-around goal.
Co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy turned away 30 shots for her tenth win of the season. On the other side of the rink, MacDonald stood tall in net for St. Lawrence, making 43 saves during regulation.
“We certainly were struggling to put it past [MacDonald],” Fry said. “At the same time, [the Saints’ defenders] were not letting us get to the net and crash her.”
The Crimson pressured MacDonald throughout the game but particularly in the third period, outshooting St. Lawrence, 19-10, in the final frame of regulation. Armstrong’s game winner was Harvard’s first shot on goal in overtime.
Less than a year ago, the Saints ended the Crimson’s season, upsetting Harvard in the ECAC semifinals with a 2-1 overtime win. On Saturday, the loss provided extra motivation for the Crimson.
“We hit a point where there was no way we were losing that game, especially with [St. Lawrence’s] ending our season last year,” Fry said. “We didn’t go up there for two losses, absolutely not.”
After the .500 weekend, Harvard retained first place in the ECAC. The Crimson sits four points ahead of Cornell and Clarkson, who both have played one fewer game than Harvard. Seven conference games remain on the Crimson’s regular season schedule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the women’s hockey team was skating to a comeback victory in overtime against St. Lawrence, its male counterpart failed to follow suit.
With the score knotted at three apiece, the horn sounded to indicate the end of regulation. But unlike its last overtime game, where Harvard eked out a 6-5 victory over BU, the Crimson (5-13-1, 3-11 ECAC) was unable to find the back of the net first in the extra period, falling to the Saints (11-10-3, 4-5-3), 4-3, Saturday night at Bright Hockey Center.
The loss marks the Crimson’s sixth consecutive loss and fourth straight defeat at home, where Harvard has not won since Nov. 10, 2012.
“It’s definitely frustrating,” freshman forward Jimmy Vesey said. “It seems like all of these losses are blending together, and it’s not really all that fun to lose, but I think that today was a step in the right direction. We played really hard, and St. Lawrence is a good team, and we were right there.”
Nearly four minutes into overtime, St. Lawrence forward Patrick Doherty slid the puck around the net, sending it to the edge of the left faceoff circle. Defender George Hughes collected the puck before sending it past junior goaltender Raphael Girard to lift the Saints to victory.
Harvard had the best opportunity to break the tie with less than three minutes left in regulation when forward Chris Martin and defender Patrick Raley entered the penalty box, giving the Crimson a two-man advantage on the ice for a full two minutes.
But despite the advantage, Harvard couldn’t convert, and Saints defenders deflected shot after shot, sending the game into an extra period.
“We had some looks, had some shots, but ultimately we have to find a way to get a goal there,” Crimson coach Ted Donato said. “We needed someone to step up and make a play. We had plenty of opportunities, we had possession of the puck—I think the whole time, maybe the puck came out of the zone once. I think our guys were battling, but I think there’s no question that our execution could be better.”
While Harvard struggled to get its offense going, recording only one shot in the first thirteen minutes, St. Lawrence lit up the scoreboard twice in the span of two minutes.
Eight minutes into the game, defender Pat Raley collected the puck outside the right faceoff circle and shot it towards the net. The puck bounced off Girard’s pads, but as the goaltender moved up to corral it, forward Pat Doherty pushed it into the net to notch the first goal of the contest.
The Saints extended its lead to two when, with their goaltender pulled to put an extra man on the ice, forward Kyle Flanagan received a pass from forward Greg Carey and crossed a shot past Girard.
But the Crimson retaliated a few minutes later during a power play as freshman forward Brian Hart passed to Vesey, who was waiting on the right edge of the crease. Vesey tapped the puck behind goaltender Matt Weninger to give Harvard its first point of the night.
Vesey struck again 11 seconds into the second period to tie the game, 2-2. Sophomore forward Colin Blackwell and Hart worked the puck across the ice before sliding it to Vesey, who was skating towards the left post. The freshman shot it into the back right of the net to tally his second goal of the game, a feat he had not accomplished since Harvard’s home opener against Bentley.
St. Lawrence briefly regained the lead 12 minutes later when Girard, anticipating a shot from Flanagan, drifted to the right post. Flanagan instead crossed the puck to the left, where forward Jeremy Wick collected it and shot it into the empty left side of the net.
Senior forward Alex Fallstrom brought the score to 3-3 off of a rebound from his own missed shot attempt. The Crimson looked like it would finally gain its first lead of the game when junior defender Dan Ford drove the puck up the ice early in the third and slapped it into the crease. The puck zinged off of the right post and slid across the crease before hitting the left post. Upon review, the referees decided that the puck did not completely cross the goal line, and the score remained tied.
“I give St. Lawrence credit, they kept coming and they came in having won three in a row,” Donato said. “We knew after having beaten Dartmouth last night, that they were going to throw a lot of pucks at the net. We thought really after the first 10, 12 minutes, we really settled down and played a lot better.”
