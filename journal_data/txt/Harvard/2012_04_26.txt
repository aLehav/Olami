After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 received the first Freshman Advising Award at the Teaching and Advising Awards Dinner co-hosted by the Undergraduate Council and the Advising Programs Office on Wednesday evening.
The award, established through UC legislation last academic year, was created to incentivize better freshman advising.
“I am deeply honored to receive this award because it is a testament to how far our advising system has come,” Dingman said. “Harvard has world-class faculty and superb libraries and laboratories, but strong advising and mentoring is what truly sets it apart.”
Representatives also announced that they would be renaming the prize the “Thomas Dingman Award for Freshman Advising” in honor of its first recipient.
“We deliberated on the nominees and [the choice] was clear to all of us,” said UC Winthrop House Representative Phillip Z Yao ’13. “This is our small way of acknowledging all that Dean Dingman has done for the freshman class.”
Award nominees and the students who nominated them were invited to a commemorative dinner hosted in Dunster House Dining Hall yesterday. The UC Education Committee, headed by Vice Chairs Darragh Nolan ’15 and Terah E. Lyons ’14, organized the sit-down dinner for the guests.
“The best thing about this evening is that we do not just honor the people who win,” UC Education Committee Chair Samuel F. Himel ’12 said. “All the nominees and students are invited, and it is a chance to celebrate the efforts of all these people.”
Like the John R. Marquand Award for Exceptional Advising and Counseling of Harvard Students, the new award includes a prize of $500 for the winning recipient.
During the dinner, engineering sciences associate professor Marko Loncar, who received the Joseph R. Levenson Memorial Teaching Prize, sat next to his teaching fellow and fellow award recipient Abishai J. Vase ’12. The two were surrounded by a table of students who had nominated them for the Levenson Prize for their course, Engineering Sciences 50: Introduction to Electrical Engineering. Traditionally, the Levenson Prize is awarded to one senior faculty member, one junior faculty member, and one teaching fellow.
“Abishai would stay in the basement of Lamont Library until early morning so that everyone would not only finish their homework but also understand it entirely,” said Johnathan M. Budd ’15 when presenting the award to Vase.
Vase returned to the microphone a few minutes later to present the Levenson Prize for senior faculty to Loncar. Vase noted that Loncar always took the time to get to know his teaching fellows and students.
“For us, what really matters is the care professor Loncar shows for both the content and the students,” Vase said. “He constantly bugs us for more ways to meet his students.”
The Levenson Prize for junior faculty was awarded to expository writing preceptor Jerusha T. Achterberg.
The UC received a total of 155 nominations for teaching and advising awards this year. Of these, eight received distinctions.
The Marquand Award was awarded to Eliot House Tutor Ryan D. Rippel, Assistant Director for Undergraduate Studies in Biomedical Engineering Sujata K. Bhatia, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Teaching Fellow Leonard Wood, and Peer Advising Fellow Kirkpatrick B. Fergus ’12.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduating seniors in the Class of 2012 will receive an official class color on Class Day during a ceremony hosted by the Harvard Alumni Association, restoring a long-held Harvard tradition that has not been practiced since 1963.
According to this tradition, Harvard’s rising sophomore class will inherit the class color of the past spring’s graduating seniors—in this case, blue—in the fall, which organizers say will foster class unity and transition.
“Class unity that is fostered in freshman year is lost when students move into their houses at the beginning of sophomore year,” said Justin Lanning ’12, a co-chair of the HAA’s Building Community Committee, which decided to reinstate the tradition.
“We don’t think that House pride and class unity are mutually exclusive, and we hope that students will be able to carry both sources of pride throughout their time at Harvard,” he said.
In order to reinstate the cycle of inheriting class colors in full, the Harvard classes of 2013 and 2014 will receive their respective colors of orange and green during Class Day of their senior year. Alumni from the 1950s and 1960s have been invited to return to take part in these Class Day ceremonies.
This fall, students from the Class of 2012 will be invited to return to campus and pass on their class color to the Class of 2015 during a sophomore-wide barbecue event—a ceremony that the HAA hopes will continue in the future.
Though the sophomore barbecue was originally planned as a separate event, HAA members said that the barbecue seemed like an appropriate platform to launch the class color tradition.
“These are two events that are meaningful on their own,” said Catherine Katz ’13, Undergraduate Events Subcommittee co-chair of the HAA’s Building Community Committee. “But by combining them, we create a new tradition that will stand out and be even more significant for future classes.”
The Class of 2015 will inherit the color blue from the Class of 2012, the color that both classes would have received, if the original cycle not been interrupted in 1963. To celebrate the occasion, the UC is hosting a contest to design a commemorative t-shirt. Sophomores will be receiving blue t-shirts with the winning design at the barbecue in the fall.
“We wanted to do something that would really make the color become a part of the class,” said Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, UC Vice President and member of the HAA Building Community Committee. “Your class color is something that you’ll carry with you throughout your Harvard career as well as when you become alumni.”
This tradition of handing down class colors began when the Class of 1885 received the color green. The three original colors—green, orange, and blue—represent Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale, Harvard’s fiercest athletic and academic rivals of the time.
According to Lanning, Harvard students would originally acquire their colors by stealing the school flags of these rival colleges. He noted that this story remains largely unknown to current students.
“Harvard has an incredible number of rich traditions—some that continue today and some that have faded over time,” Lanning said. “By bringing back class colors, we want to connect students to a long and rich Harvard history.”

Oscar-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones ’69 was awarded the 18th annual Harvard Arts Medal at a ceremony on Thursday that highlighted his time at Harvard as well as his distinguished acting career.
“I believe my experience here was the best thing that happened to my creative life,” Jones said after receiving the award presented by University President Drew G. Faust. “For that, I will be grateful as long as I live.”
Jones’s varied talents and lengthy career were praised by Faust.
“[Jones] invites us to look at life without flinching until it reveals a spare truth,” Faust said. “He has explored life’s hardest questions as an actor, director, writer, and producer. We like to think Harvard prepared Tommy Lee Jones for all of this.”
Jones discussed his time at Harvard with former classmate and fellow actor John A. Lithgow ’67. Jones and Lithgow worked on student productions together during their time at Harvard and have remained friends since their undergraduate years.
“I started hearing a lot about you as an extraordinary anomaly—the only leading man in embyro who was also on the varsity football team,” Lithgow said to Jones.
Lithgow and Jones moved chronologically through Jones’s career, discussing everything from the Loeb Drama Center’s production of “White House Happening” in 1967 to Jones’s upcoming film with Meryl Streep, “Hope Springs.” In between humorous anecdotes about acting, Lithgow showed clips from Jones’ roles in the 2007 film “No Country for Old Men” and 1993 film “The Fugitive,” for which he won an Oscar.
Before receiving the medal, Jones answered a few brief questions from the audience, ranging from a query about breaking into the movie business to a marriage proposal.
After a woman in the audience asked Jones to marry her, he responded, “Yes. But you have to speak to my wife. She may have an opinion.”
This event kicked off the 20th annual Arts First Festival, which will last until April 29, 2012.

Harvard Law School Professors David B. Wilkins ’77 and C. Adrian Vermeule ’90 were elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the oldest honorary independent research centers in the U.S., earlier this month.
Their class of new members includes 11 other Harvard University affiliates, as well as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and Melinda F. Gates.
Vermeule said that his election took him by surprise. He was not in his office when the letter was delivered, so when he received a congratulatory email from a friend, he initially did not know to what his friend was referring.
“I had no idea it was in the works,” Vermeule said.
Wilkins said he fondly remembers his first experience at the Academy when, as a young professor, he accompanied a colleague to an event hosted at the Academy.
“The first person to actually map Mount Everest was speaking, and I remember thinking, ‘what an amazing place this is, full of all these people who have done so many great things,’” Wilkins said. “But it never occurred to me in a million years that I would ever be joining this very select fraternity.”
Vermeule said that he is particularly pleased with his election because both of his parents, Emily D. T. Vermeule and Cornelius C. Vermeule III ’47, were members of the Academy. Emily Vermeule, who was a classics professor at Harvard, was elected in 1971; her husband, who was a curator of classical arts at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, was elected in 1973.
Wilkins and Vermeule originally met when Vermeule was enrolled in Wilkins’ civil procedure class as a first year law student.
“He was a star then and he’s just continued to be a superstar ever since,” Wilkins said.
Vermeule said he looks forward to meeting the other members of the Academy, including newly-elected member Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.
“I am dying to meet him, because I have many suggestions for the Amazon website,” Vermeule said jokingly. “I’m just excited to meet him. I buy so many books on Amazon I feel like I’ve subsidized that company to a large degree.”
Both Wilkins and Vermuele said that they are interested in contributing to the Academy’s publication and research efforts.
“I always think that we are the luckiest people in the world, because we get paid to think and teach and write,” Wilkins said. “That’s an honor in and of itself. But on top of that, to be recognized as part of a great tradition that stretches back to the earliest days of our republic...that’s the greatest benefit of all.”

Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, head of the popular introductory course Economics 10: Principles of Economics and adviser to presidential candidate Mitt Romney, will take over as chair of the economics department starting on July 1. He will replace professor John Y. Campbell, who is wrapping up a three-year term as chair.
“I was not surprised to be asked, as several of my colleagues told me they had suggested me for the position,” Mankiw wrote in an emailed statement. “I look forward to making the world’s best economics department even better.”
Mankiw has taught at Harvard since 1985 and also served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Bush administration. He said that he plans to continue to work as a part-time adviser to the Romney campaign and will continue to teach Ec 10, but that he has cancelled his plans to offer a freshman seminar next year and may reduce his other teaching responsibilities as necessary.
Looking forward, Mankiw stated that he will aim to secure more faculty hires in economics. Like other departments in the social sciences, economics faced a hiring freeze following the financial crisis in 2008 but has begun to see growth in recent years.
“The department may seem large to some, but we have many students, so our student-faculty ratio is much higher than the university average,” Mankiw wrote.
According to Campbell, the outgoing chair, negotiating faculty searches is a significant component of the position. Other duties include supervising the staff, interacting with the Board of Overseers, and interfacing between the department and the dean of social sciences, Peter V. Marsden.
“It’s hard work,” Campbell said. “We all feel that we should take a turn.”
Campbell said he enthusiastically supports Mankiw’s appointment, which was made by Marsden.
“I think Greg is a very good choice,” Campbell said. “[He] has very high professional standing. He’s very well-respected.... He’s highly committed to undergraduate teaching.”
Campbell also stated that Mankiw’s 27 years of teaching at Harvard prepares him well for the position.
“He’s been here his whole career,” he said. “He knows the institution.”

Days after Harvard Kennedy School student Bo Guagua released an exclusive statement to The Crimson, new information has emerged in the controversy surrounding the downfall of his father Bo Xilai.
Senior Communist Party leaders told The New York Times that Xilai had conducted an extensive wiretapping operation for a period of several years, continuing the work of other party officials. According to The Telegraph Gu Kailai, the wife of Xilai, said that she was in the room when Neil Heywood—a British businessman who lived in China until his death—was poisoned last fall.
Heywood is thought to have served as a mentor to the younger Bo by assisting him in the admissions process for Harrow—a prestigious English secondary school—and Oxford University. Chinese authorities said that the family’s relationship with Heywood soured following “a conflict over economic interests,” according to a report in The Daily Mail.
Xilai was removed from his position as Party secretary of China’s Chongqing municipality in March and then deposed from the Politburo, China’s most influential political body, within several weeks.
Xilai’s rapid downfall has been shrouded in mystery as rumors swirled in recent months about alleged corruption and overextension of power.
Bo Guagua entered the spotlight while he was a student in England. He became known for supposedly throwing expensive parties and zipping around Beijing in a Ferrari, raising eyebrows and spurring questions about how his family could afford to fund his lavish social life.
In his statement on Tuesday, Bo Guagua addressed these accusations. He wrote that his private school education had been funded entirely by scholarships and assistance from his mother. He also denied the reports that he drove a Ferrari.
As the controversy heated up in recent weeks, Bo Guagua removed himself from the public eye. Until Tuesday, his last clear public communication had followed his father’s removal from his position as party leader last month.
Numerous Harvard professors declined to comment on Guagua’s situation, citing his enrollment in a Harvard graduate school.
The Dean of Students at the Kennedy School sent an email last week to students at the graduate school asking them to refrain from talking to the media.
“The School does not share information about our students without their permission, and we ask that you respect the privacy and dignity of all members of our community,” read the email.
“[Y]ou should feel no obligation to respond to journalists’ questions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the final week of conference play with five teams sitting within a game of each other in the Ivy League standings, the four Ivy tournament berths were still very much up in the air.
But after Penn’s victory over Princeton on Wednesday night, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team knows its fate: for the second straight year, the Crimson will be playing in the Ivy League tournament.
On May 4, Harvard will begin its quest to grab the Ivy League’s automatic bid the NCAA tournament in the first round of the four-team, single-elimination tournament.
Who the Crimson (8-6, 4-2 Ivy) matches up with on that day will be determined in part by its meeting with No. 10/11 Dartmouth this Friday night at Harvard Stadium.
The 2011 Ivy League champions, Dartmouth hasn’t seemed to miss a beat in 2012. After entering the season ranked No. 11/14 in the nation, the Big Green went 5-2 in non-conference play, its only losses coming to then-No. 5/6 Florida and then-No. 2/2 Syracuse.
Dartmouth (10-3, 5-1 Ivy) has managed to get it done with quite different personnel from a season ago. After losing 2011 Ivy League Player of the Year Kat Collins, First Team All-Ivy defender Shannie MacKenzie, and Second Team All-Ivy attacker Greta Meyer to graduation, the Big Green has turned to some new faces to lead the team.
Senior midfielders Kristin Goldberg and Sarah Plumb have done just that, spearheading the Dartmouth offense with a combined 64 goals, accounting for 44 percent of the Big Green scoring. Goldberg and Plumb enter Friday’s matchup sitting in fourth and fifth in the Ivy League in goals per game with 2.54 and 2.38, respectively.
Looking to counter the Dartmouth duo will be the stingy Crimson defense that leads the Ivy League in goals against average by a wide margin (Harvard allows 7.76 scores per contest while No. 2 Princeton allows 9.08). The Crimson has been especially stingy as of late, holding two of its previous four opponents to under five goals and all to under 10.
“I think the top teams in the Ivy League are very equal to each other though and that anything can happen,” junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault said. “I don’t think we see ourselves as the lesser team at all. I think we’re ready for this game, and we’re ready for a challenge.”
But while Dartmouth’s leaders on offense have changed, its anchor on defense has remained the same. Kristen Giovanniello, the 2011 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, is back in net for the Big Green and has displayed no signs of a sophomore slump. After leading the Ancient Eight in save percentage as a rookie, Giovanniello has followed up by stopping 46.4 percent of the shots she’s faced thus far this season, good for second in the conference behind Harvard rookie goalkeeper Kelly Weis. In last year’s regular season finale, Giovanniello helped shut down the Crimson offense, stopping 13 of Harvard’s 20 attempts en route to a 14-7 Big Green win.
“She’s actually a left-handed goalie, which is pretty rare in lacrosse, so we’ve been focusing a lot on that, placing our shots,” junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “Shooting has definitely been one of our focuses this week in practice.”
The Crimson will look to Tetreault to help get balls past Giovanniello and points up on the scoreboard. The crafty midfielder has been hot of late, scoring four goals in each of the Crimson’s past two contests. Sophomore midfielder Kyleigh Keating has also emerged as a key contributor of late.
After posting no scores and one assist through Harvard’s first nine games, Keating has put up six goals and three assists in the Crimson’s last five matchups. In last Saturday’s 10-3 win over Columbia, Keating picked up a game-high seven ground balls and four draw controls.
“Keating’s been doing amazing on the draw,” VanderMeulen said. “We were struggling a little bit with the draw in the beginning of the year. Keating has just stepped up a lot in getting the ball and taking control in the draw circle. She’s also been contributing a lot on attack. She’s a great feeder. She sees a lot of the field.”
Co-captain Melanie Baskind and junior Micaela Cyr join Keating and Tetreault at midfield, helping form a balanced Harvard offensive attack.
(The Crimson is the only member of the Ivy League without a representative among the conferences top ten in goals or assists).
Harvard will likely need all of its key players to come out strong on Friday if it is to take down the Big Green.
“Dartmouth is a very good team,” VanderMeulen said. “We know that they’re going to come out strong, and we need to come out stronger.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the final weekend of conference play, many Harvard teams are still in contention for the Ancient Eight title and/or a berth to the NCAA tournament. Here are the projections of what each team needs to do in order to succeed:
Baseball
After taking three of four contests against Brown last week, the Harvard baseball team is still in control of its own destiny in the Ivy League. This weekend, the Crimson tees off against Dartmouth, a team that sits in first place in Harvard's division. The Crimson must sweep all four games against the Big Green—two at home, two in New Hampshire—in order to force a one-game playoff against its New Hampshire rival to decide which team will advance to the Ivy League champtionship series.
Men's Golf
Ivy’s are coming at a good time for men’s golf, as the team’s play has been shaping up after just two tournaments in the spring season thus far. Though the Crimson hasn’t won the Ivy League championship since 1975—its only time earning the title—there is a chance Harvard can win it once more in 2012.
Last week, the Crimson finished second in the Century Intercollegiate behind URI but ahead of all of the Ivy League teams competing. Seniors Mark Pollak and captain Tony Grillo, all-Ivy League selections in 2010, will look to lead the team finish in strong in their last year at Galloway National.
Harvard will face stiff competition from many of the Ivy League squads, including Yale, who won the championship last year as well as the Princeton Invitational two weeks back. Columbia and Princeton also finished ahead of the Crimson in that tournament, and Dartmouth bested Harvard last fall while winning the Philadelphia Big 5 Invitational (in which Penn finished ahead of the Crimson as well).
If Harvard can replicate its success of last weekend, chances are relatively high for the Crimson to take its first Ivy League championship in 37 years.
Women's Golf
Harvard women’s golf is heading to New Jersey this weekend to compete for the 2012 Ivy League Championship. Based on the fall and spring season, the Crimson has the skills, training, and experience to win the league and head to the NCAA Regionals.
Harvard has been succeeding in team and individual play in the past year. The Crimson has several invitational titles under its belt, including the most recent Roar-EE Invitational Crown. Within the league, Harvard won the Yale and Princeton Invitationals earlier this fall.
While the Crimson has experienced some difficulty and exhaustion from bad weather and long tournaments, the women have outstroked their competition overall. Riding on a high from the previous weekend, Harvard should have the confidence to stay focused and come home with this weekend.
Individually, women’s golf has some of the top golfers in the country. Tiffany Lim  ’15 has consistently shown her skill and has been ranked as the top ten freshmen in the country. Another valuable rookie from this year is Brenna Nelson, who steadily contributes to the team’s efforts. Under the leadership of captain Christine Cho, the Crimson has the talent and momentum necessary to win.
The last time Harvard as a team came away with the title was 2009, with Penn and Yale winning in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Harvard will look to redeem its second place finish in the tournament last year when the team takes on the rest of the league at the Seaview Bay Course.
Men's Lacrosse
The projections for men’s lacrosse is simple. If the Crimson wins, it makes the Ivy Tournament as the No. 3 seed to keep its season going. If it loses, Harvard will need to rely on Dartmouth, which has struggled all season, to beat Brown in order to clinch the No. 4 seed. Otherwise, the Crimson’s season will be over for the 2012 campaign.
Women's Lacrosse
After Penn’s victory over Princeton on Wednesday night, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team knows its fate: for the second straight year, the Crimson will be playing in the Ivy League tournament.
The only two games left are between Harvard and second-place Dartmouth and between Cornell and Brown. Cornell is tied with the Crimson for third, while Brown is out of contention for the tournament or the Ancient Eight title.
No matter what the outcome of the two contests, Dartmouth, Penn, Cornell, and Harvard will be the ones battling for an automatic spot in the NCAA tournament.
Softball
Coming into the year as reigning champions, the Harvard softball team was viewed as the favorite to repeat. As the Ivy Championship Series looms, there has been no reason to change that prediction. In a home sweep of Brown, the Crimson locked up their third straight championship appearance, along with a home field adavantage, and will battle either Penn or Cornell for the title.
Harvard swept a doubleheader with Penn by a combined tally of 14-4 while splitting its doubleheader against Cornell, though the Crimson outscored the Big Red, 14-12 on the day.
Since those two series, Harvard has only looked stronger as the 1-2 punch of senior Rachel Brown and sophomore Laura Ricciardone has been unhittable of late and an improved Jane Alexander has provided consistency at the top of the Crimson lineup. It would take a major upset for Harvard not to take home the title once again in 2012.
Men's Tennis
Right now one is the magic number for the Harvard men’s tennis team. The Crimson has one more game left in its season and needs one more win to take possession of that elusive Ivy title.
This Saturday, the Crimson takes on Dartmouth. Here are some reasons the Crimson should win:
 Mutual      Opponents: Against the mighty Quakers, the Crimson faced little to no      challenge as it won its match, 6-1. How did the Big Green do against Penn,      you ask? Not quite as well—in fact, the final was 5-1 to the Quaker’s      advantage. Interestingly, the only other Ivy loss that either of these      teams has suffered has been against Columbia. So, thankfully for both of      these schools, the Lions will not be present on Saturday afternoon.
 The      Freshmen: For a majority of the spring season, four out of Harvard’s six      singles starters were rookies. Standouts such as Denis Nguyen, Shaun      Chaudhuri, and Alex Steinroeder, to name a few, have not only played but      actually won matches for their team. Nguyen, who plays at the No. 2 court,      took the Vanderbilt match on a third-set thriller early in the season,      while Steinroeder took control of the tempo and won the decisive match in      the competition versus Virginia Tech. These first-years are not only      skilled, but now they’re experienced. It’s a killer combo.
 Past      Matches: On Sat., Feb. 18, a few guys dressed in crimson overtook their      green-clad counterparts. That’s right, the two teams have already played      each other this season in the ECAC Championship Semi-Finals, and the      Crimson was victorious, 4-2. Since that time, Harvard has only lost once.
Last Sunday, with a win over Brown, the Crimson clinched a share of the title. This week, we’re betting that they’re going all the way, and with the defeat over Dartmouth, they’ll earn their first championship since the 2008 season.
Men's Volleyball
The No. 15 Harvard men’s volleyball team is having its best season in program history. After only managing one conference win in 2011, the Crimson has made a complete turnaround in 2012, going 18-5 overall and taking second in the EIVA with 10 conference victories. With that success came new recognition, too, as Harvard entered the American Volleyball Coaches Association rankings for the first time in its history earlier this month.
Co-captain outside hitter Matt Jones, who has been delivering on both sides of the ball all season, leads the Crimson. Jones is currently ranked second in the EIVA in kills per set with 3.80 and sits ninth in the country with 0.43 service aces per set. Additionally, the senior has won both EIVA Offensive and Defensive Player of the Week awards during his final campaign, and he most recently picked up an EIVA All-Conference nod. Joining Jones in his All-Conference honors are freshman outside hitter DJ White and junior setter Rob Lothman, while Harvard coach Brian Baise garnered the EIVA Coach of the Year award.
The Crimson will take on George Mason on the neutral ground of Penn State Thursday afternoon in the EIVA semifinals. In the two matches played against the No. 3 seed Patriots earlier in the season, Harvard split the series, 1-1, and will have to rely on its strong hitting and defense to move past its foe.
If Harvard were to advance, the squad would likely take on No. 8 Penn State in the EIVA Final with a spot in the NCAA tournament on the line. The Crimson came close to downing the Nittany Lions on Apr. 7th at University Park, but Harvard was unable to close out its 2-0 lead and lost the match in five sets. While Penn State, the 2008 National Champions, are the favorites to book its place in the NCAA tournament, the Crimson has shown the can hang with the best this season, and it will have to play its best volleyball to make it to big show.
Women's Waterpolo
On Friday, the women's waterpolo team begins the CWPA Eastern Championship, the winner of which earns an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament. Harvard's faces Mercyhurst the first day, and if they win, will take on Princeton in the evening and two more foes on Saturday and Sunday.
The Crimson has played both the Lakers and the Tigers twice so far this season. In the bouts against Mercyhurst, Harvard handled the games both times, winning 10-4 and 12-3. Princeton's contests were much closer, with the Crimson losing each with scores of 9-6 and 9-8.

Spring is finally here. For the Harvard Hoochies, a group of self-proclaimed “BU biddies, hooching and husband hunting at Harvard Final Clubs,” that means more than nicer weather. For one, there's the start of Garden Party Season, which the Hoochies had been eagerly counting down to on their new website.
But the start of Spring also means that a whole host of new Harvard teams and athletes are taking the field. We caught up with the Harvard Hoochies to get their thoughts on baseball, lawn sports, and their summer plans.
The Harvard Crimson: It’s been almost two months since we last caught up. What’s been going on? 
Harvard Hoochies: Inhaling carbless air, husband hunting, wearing bandage skirts…the usual.
THC: We’ve heard there have been some new additions to the Harvard Hoochies. How are the rookies performing thus far? 
We were going to initiate four new Hoochies, but things didn’t go as planned. Read up on it here.
THC: What’s the process like for becoming a Harvard Hoochie? Is there a draft? Do you guys have scouts?
HH: The biddies who were potential new Hoochies frequent the final club scene quite a bit. There was an initiation process that involved heavy drinking and reciting the history of Harvard and the Harvard Hoochies.
THC: Been to any good Harvard sports games recently?
HH: We like athletes, not sports. Big difference.
THC: Did y'all get to watch the basketball team play Vanderbilt in the NCAA tournament? If so, what did you think of the game?
HH: Why would one waste time watching a basketball game when one can be in a tanning bed?
THC: Lax bros or baseball bros?
HH: How can you choose? You have the baseball guys in those tight pants, aka, The Delphic bros in those tight pants.
And when it comes to Harvard Lax…have you seen Dan DiMaria’s hair blowing in the wind? It’s like an Herbal Essence commercial.
THC: Favorite spring athletes?
HH: The favorite athlete will be the one who pops the question with a rock bigger than what Brad gave Angie.
THC: Favorite lawn sport?
HH: It’s a toss-up between tanning and dayging.
THC: What’s the hooching process like over the summer?
HH: In addition to honing in on that virginal, summertime glow, we will all be graduating. Our followers will get to see where we take the Harvard Hoochies next.
THC: Any big plans before graduation?
HH: Besides not studying and bedazzling our graduation caps, we will also be throwing a few ragers at Daisy Buchanan’s (@DaisysBoston), including one this Friday.
There’s also the goal of being impregnated by a final club bro, but that’s a given.
