After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The series premiere of “Gentleman Jack” aired on HBO April 22, establishing itself as one of the more unusual dramas recently produced, both in premise and in execution. The sweeping English countryside and swaggering music sets the tone for the introduction of a no-nonsense protagonist. Donning black garb and a top hat, Anne Lester isn’t your typical period piece English lady.
The series centers around Anne (Suranne Jones), an outwardly stoic and scrupulous woman hiding the secret that she’s a lesbian. The series is based on the diaries of the real Anne Lister, who detailed her various relationships in entries written in code. These diaries were only decoded long after her death in 1840. She is a bold and pragmatic character, especially considering the world she lives in: 1832 Halifax, England. Following a fall out with her former lover Vere Hobart (Jodhi May), the premiere sees Lister returning to her family’s ancestral home, Shibden Hall, in order to oversee the financial well being of her family estate. She is informed of the land’s potential as a profitable coal mine and begins to form a strategy to exploit her holdings. She also becomes interested in a young woman living in a nearby estate, Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle), and makes plans to win her heart.
The episode weaves a dizzying array of emotion, spinning from one startlingly emotional moment to one nearly devoid of it. One moment, the focus is on Lister’s romantic past when she is heartbroken and lost, while the next sequence snaps the viewer back into the cold, empty halls of Shibden.
It is unclear what message the series plans to convey. Suranne Jones’ Anne Lister may be intended to represent a feminist or BGLTQ icon, which would certainly be fitting given the historical nature of the character, and the secret life she lived. Or, in what seems a more likely scenario, Anne Lister may serve as a character study, intended to examine a unique historical character, with the series interpreting her life through a fictional lens. Given the plot details of the premiere, however, the overall direction remains unclear.
The pilot serves its purpose well. The plot takes a firm stance on the overall character of Anne Lister, but leaves ample room to develop her further. She is calm yet troubled, stoic yet tender, straightforward yet secretive. The episode is keen to draw on her troubled romantic past, but the character and her romantic aspirations are not over-sexualized. The scenes where the audience sees Anne Lister at her weakest and most vulnerable are powerful, albeit brief.
As she says in one of the first scenes, “I’ve been an Icarus, I’ve flown too near the sun. And now I crash back to Earth at Shibden, shabby little Shibden.” Yet even in the glimpses of Lister’s inner anguish, Suranne Jones executes these moments wonderfully. With that level of performance in the pilot, future episodes will hopefully take advantage Anne Lister’s emotional range and give Jones the opportunity to showcase her abilities.
The showrunners have set the plot in motion, with the dual storylines of Anne’s romantic ambition with Ann Walker and her business undertaking with the family coal. There are, however, plenty of room for the story to grow in several directions and enough characters introduced for intricate subplots to develop. On that note, it will be interesting to see how “Gentleman Jack” develops the minor characters that surround Anne. Will they fill out the plot, providing effective contrasts and contributing their own to the overall tone of the show? Or will they simply serve as pawns for Anne to push her way through, merely remaining as background noise in Anne’s quest for purpose?
Undoubtedly, there’s a lot going on in this episode. Taking into account the mass of potential storylines and subplots, it’s a staggering body of screenwriting. But if the show can sufficiently explore Lister’s backstory and produce a round character, then “Gentleman Jack” has the potential to cement itself as one of the more unique examples of a period drama.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains major spoilers for "Avengers: Endgame." 
It isn't hyperbolic to say that "Avengers: Endgame,” directed by the Russo brothers, may be the biggest cinematic event of all time. It isn't a perfect movie, but at the end of the day, "Endgame" is a love letter to the fans who have stuck with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) through its 11 years and 22 films. A major reason for its success is its treatment of the MCU's founding member, Iron Man. When Robert Downey Jr. first donned the hot-rod red-and-gold colors of the armored Avenger in Jon Favreau's 2008 film, he was only a few years removed from rehab, and Iron Man was far from Marvel's best-known character. Needless to say, Marvel Studios took a risk when it used Iron Man as a launch pad for an unprecedented network of interconnected films that comprise its cinematic universe. So why Iron Man? Marvel had sold its rights to most of its iconic characters: Hulk was with Universal, Spider-Man with Sony, and X-Men and the Fantastic Four were with Fox. Starting a cinematic universe, an unprecedented feat, on a character most mainstream audiences hadn't been exposed to, was risky to say the least. But despite all these improbabilities, it's now impossible to fathom the MCU without its signature "genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist." With 10 films featuring Iron Man, Marvel has carefully constructed Tony Stark's journey, setting the stage for "Endgame" to leave audiences with a compelling and satisfying conclusion for the superhero that started it all.
Favreau's 2008 origin film introduces "Iron Man" to audiences with a redemption arc. Tony indulges in a reckless lifestyle, wrapped in a cocoon of high-glamour, and dodging the real world implications of his weapon manufacturing company. But Tony's mindset is shaken when he's taken hostage; he, along with fellow captive Yinsen (Shaun Toub), build the first Iron Man suit to escape, but Yinsen sacrifices himself for Tony to survive. Wracked with guilt, Tony uses these experiences to refocus his attentions: He builds a new rendition of the Iron Man suit to launch a vigilante campaign to destroy Stark Industries weapons that have landed in the wrong hands. This sets the precedent for Tony's character in future films, including "Avengers: Endgame.” Technology is his first line of defense against adversity — just as he built his first suit to escape terrorist captivity, he takes control of scenarios whenever he can. But it's also hard for him to resist the credit for his heroic actions, so much so that at the end of "Iron Man,” he reveals to the world a now iconic catchphrase, "I am Iron Man.” As a character, Tony Stark blows existing genre tropes out of the water. Previous superhero films (Donner's "Superman" and Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy) used secret identities as major plot points, so from the outset, audiences knew Tony's arc would be unique.
From the egotistical character we learned to love in "Iron Man,” Tony is able to grow in "The Avengers.” He has to make concessions to operate in a group larger than himself. Perhaps the key exchange in the film is an argument between Iron Man and Captain America, in which Captain America says, "I've seen the footage — the only thing you really fight for is yourself.” This exchange sets up Iron Man's sacrifice in the film's climax when he flies a nuclear warhead into space, risking his own life to save Manhattan. This scene fulfills Tony's arc both in "The Avengers" and his two prior standalone films. He learns to make the bigger play, putting his own desires aside to a degree that Captain America (and the audience) doubted he ever would. More than anything, it suggests there's more motivating his character than ego and guilt.
Tony's defining heroic moment is quickly followed by downfall, however, as he suffers debilitating psychological trauma from his brush with death. This trauma brings out the worst of his overbearing character. In "Avengers: Age of Ultron,” for instance, Tony operates out of the fear that one day, the Avengers can't hold their own anymore. He copes with that fear the only way he knows how: hiding behind technological creations. However, for the first time, Tony's technology fails him, and his attempt at A.I. inadvertently develops into the villainous “Ultron.” The guilt Tony suffers over the repercussions of such a failure damages his mindset (using technology to seize control), and this makes him so eager to control the Avengers in "Captain America: Civil War.” Tony's battered ego becomes desperate — he must be proven right in "Civil War" — but these hot-headed emotions ultimately leave him defeated, representing his new low.
So why did audiences still root for Iron Man in "Avengers: Endgame" despite these setbacks? Sentimentality over seeing the godfather figure of the MCU back in action is surely a part of it. But leave it to Marvel to pick up his character arc after "Civil War" and redeem Tony Stark for a second time — this time by exploring the theme of fatherhood. There's Tony's guilt over never mending the battered relationship with his father, his mentorship with Peter Parker (Spider-Man), and in “Endgame,” the introduction of his daughter in "Avengers: Endgame.”
First, "Endgame" builds off earlier films in the MCU ("Iron Man 2"), which painted a strained relationship between Tony and his father, Howard. "Civil War" reveals that Tony's (unknowingly) final, bitter interaction with his father scarred Tony forever with the guilt over never having been able to tell his father that he loved him and appreciated everything he'd done. So with time travel a possibility in “Endgame,” the Russo brothers give Tony a moment with his father in the 1970s, immediately before Tony was born. The caveat, however, is that they should somehow converse without Howard ever knowing he's talking with his son from the future, since such a revelation would break the timeline continuity. This allows for an innocent and surprisingly open exchange between two eccentric innovators who were not able to express affection as father and son. What makes that moment so emotional is that they're not bound by the stress of their past relationship — they're two fathers (or father-to-be in Howard's case) worried about failing their children. Tony worries about losing his daughter in his new quest, and Howard is anxious about being a father at all — he doesn't want a son to become like him because "the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.” Of course, the child Howard ends up having is Tony, so Howard's doubts parallel Captain America's comments in "The Avengers" and again, Tony is set up to make the big team-play at the climax of "Endgame.” Tony's able to connect with his father in this ephemeral moment because being a father himself gives him new perspective on why Howard neglected him as a child. On the other hand, Tony's able to forgive both his father for his lack of support, and himself for never having the courage to take the first step toward reconciliation. As Tony departs, he hugs and thanks his father, finds some much needed closure to fill his biggest emotional void.
Tony's relationship with Peter Parker (Spider-Man) marks another major step in developing his parental journey. Considering Tony's troublesome relationship with his father and the death of Peter Parker's Uncle Ben, it feels natural for Stark to want to mentor Peter in "Spider-Man: Homecoming," which unfolds two years before "Endgame" begins. This budding relationship presents Tony with the opportunity to correct some of his father's mistakes and build Peter into a better version of himself. He shows parental concern for Parker when he takes the Spider-Man suit away from him, advising him "If you're nothing without the suit, you shouldn't have it.” Tony's overly protective behavior echoes lessons he had to learn himself in previous films, particularly when he was forced to succeed without his armor in "Iron Man 3.” He even places parental control on Peter's suit, which is noticeably more technological than previous iterations, to parallel Stark's Iron Man armors. Still, Tony restrains from showing too much care — in one hilarious scene in "Homecoming,” Tony reaches past Peter to open the car door, which Peter interprets as a hug: "It's not a hug, I'm just getting the door for you." Their relationship develops further in “Infinity War,” where Tony and Peter fight side by side for most of the film. When Peter turns to dust in Tony's arms at the end of "Infinity War,” Tony feels immeasurably guilty: There's no suit he could have built, no technology he could have used, that could have stopped his mentee from dying. This guilt is what ultimately convinces Tony to rejoin the Avengers in "Endgame,” just as he was plagued by survivor's guilt "Iron Man" after Yinsen died. Therefore, when Peter Parker returns in "Avengers: Endgame,” Tony's first instinct is to hug him, just as a father would with a returning child — it's uncontrollable and something Tony wasn't able to do with his own father before. This reunion is a reference to the faux hug played for jokes in "Homecoming" and represents how far Tony has come in caring for others and displaying that care.
The final chapter of Tony's second redemption involves his new family in "Avengers: Endgame.” The audience learns that Tony now has a daughter with his wife in the beginning of the film, fulfilling the quiet family life that always seemed out of reach for him (he discusses this impossible dream in "Avengers: Age of Ultron"). Tony's new loved ones not only raise his stakes, but are also a compelling way to test his dedication to change for the greater good. All other Avengers take up the quest to reverse Thanos' “snap” in "Avengers: Infinity War," which had decimated half the life in the universe, out of a sense of morality, having nothing else to lose, or wanting to regain something they lost.
But because Tony has thrived after the snap, he's reluctant to rejoin the Avengers. He's driven not by a need to protect his ego now, but to protect his family, and this new interest compounds some of Tony's fatal flaws from previous films. He's stubborn in refusing to even contemplate rejoining the Avengers because there's too much at risk for him. Therefore, Tony's sacrifice at the end of "Endgame" is both sorrowful and cathartic. It's a beautiful moment because it completes his redemption arc — audiences have seen how this character is capable of acting in the greater good in "The Avengers,” but they have also seen him fall to treacherous depths in recent films and doubt if he's capable of returning to form. And now, despite higher stakes, Tony finds a way to come back and deliver. He gives up seeing his daughter again, which is particularly poignant because he knows firsthand how difficult it is to grow up with an absent father. But this decision is all the more meaningful because he learned to forgive his father, and hopes his daughter may also understand one day. He's come far from his selfish but understandably protective self in the beginning of "Endgame,” when he feared conceding anything to cover other characters' losses. His final words as he uses the Infinity Gauntlet to decimate Thanos' army, "I am Iron Man," is not only a homage to the iconic line from his 2008 film, but also symbolizes how far this character has come from that moment 11 years ago. While Tony first used that line to find public glory in vigilantism, he's now put in a situation where he has given up everything to save his mentee, and sacrifices the most emotional fulfillment he's ever strived for in life (his family) to save the world anyway.
Tony's fitting sacrifice in "Avengers: Endgame" bookmarks a 10-picture journey, which is the most films that audiences of the MCU have spent with one iteration of a character. To put the magnitude of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man into perspective, Christian Bale was Batman for three films, Christopher Reeve was Superman for four, and only Hugh Jackman's Wolverine comes close with nine appearances. But emotional connection to characters takes more than just exposure. Marvel took the patience to craft characters that audiences understand, so that as they progressed, their development felt believable and relatable. With 10 films of this character development, Marvel has concocted poignant plotlines for Iron Man. The character who once found meaning in life by claiming recognition of being Iron Man has come so far by "Endgame": He's found meaning in forgiveness, in the importance of being a father, and in the power of sacrifice. As "Avengers: Endgame" cleans up Box Office records (currently the 5th highest grossing film of all time in only its second week), it's easy to attribute this success to its sheer scale or the over-the-top action, but "Endgame" succeeds with fans because it's proof that Tony Stark has a heart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Arts First festival, produced by Harvard’s Office for the Arts, is a weekend dedicated to showcasing a variety of visual art exhibitions, musical and theatrical performances, and opportunities to create art that are free and open to the public. This year is the event’s 27th year running, and it took place from May 2 to 5.
During the weekend, Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, faculty members, and other affiliates exhibited their work throughout the campus inside arts venues, classrooms, and outdoor spaces and stages.
The festival began on May 2 with the presentation of the Harvard Arts Medal, which the Office of the Arts awards each year to a Harvard alum or faculty member to recognize their contribution to the arts world. This year, the recipient was U.S. Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith ’94. Other distinguished artists were also in attendance during the weekend, including 2017 Grammy-Award winner Noah Georgeson and world-renowned pianist Angela Hewitt.
Arts First festivities continued throughout the weekend. Friday’s events included Jazz on the Plaza, a performance by the Harvard Jazz Bands, followed by a concert of three choral groups celebrating Walt Whitman.
The Performance Fair, a stream of performances on 11 stages in and around Harvard Yard, ran on Saturday. Students and faculty showcased their talents in the form of original musical compositions, classical and pop arrangements, cultural dances, improvisation comedy, poetry, a capella, among many others. Festival attendees also had the opportunity to view student work created in Harvard classes.
Additionally, “Make Art” stations were set up on campus to provide the public with the chance to make their own creations. Harvard faculty and students offered lessons in a range of visual art forms, from throwing pottery to minting coins.
This year, to conclude the Performance Fair, the Graduate School of Design World Tea Club, together with the Dudley World Music Ensemble, hosted a World Tea Ceremony. Demonstrations of global tea-making traditions provided attendees the opportunity to reflect on the events of the day.
The increasing involvement of other parts of the university, like the Harvard Art Museums and Smith Campus Center, have allowed student art to reach a broader audience through their support of the festival’s initiatives.
Marin J. Orlosky Randow ’07, coordinator of Arts First for the past five years years, has worked to expand the festival throughout Harvard’s campus.
“Every new art space on campus is going to be activated during the festival this year, which is really exciting. We’re going to have a number of outdoor site-specific theater, dance, and music performances. We’ll be able to showcase a wider range of visual art, too” she said before the festival. “I think seeing all the different ways we can use the campus to bring different art forms to life is really exciting.”
Arts First has not only grown physically over the years, but also in its publicity and attendance. Kathy M. King, who has been a part of the festival for 10 years and presented a “Make Art” ceramics station in 2019, said that she is pleased to have seen how the audience has increased over time.
“In the early days, ‘Make Art’ was a lot of families and Harvard-related people, but I’ve seen over the years that more and more people from the surrounding communities coming in,” she said. “Sometimes they identify themselves as living a few towns away, hearing about the festival, and then wanting to bring the whole family.”
She said that the positive response to the festival’s activities and production has been “really rewarding.”
Arts First also provides the student population with opportunities to actively engage with the community in artistic ways. Aviva L. Ramirez ’22 is directing the First-Year musical, ‘Cruising Altitude,’ which ran throughout the weekend of Arts First. Though she’s never directed before, she’s proud of the work that the cast and producers have put into the show and said beforehand that she looked forward to showcasing the musical during the festival.
“We really pushed to be involved in Arts First,” she said. “We wanted to reach as wide an audience as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Right before final exam period begins, the Harvard women’s golf team has other business to attend to first. The group will compete in one of four NCAA Regional Tournaments, bringing the program’s tally up to eight appearances. This year the Crimson will travel to Forest Akers West Golf Course in East Lansing, Michigan, the site of the Midwest Regional.
The event will take place over three consecutive days beginning on Monday May 6th, with the student athletes playing one full round of golf each day. At the end of it all, the top four out of five competitors from each school will be combined to form one aggregate score.
Harvard clinched its spot at the event by winning the Ivy League Championship two weeks ago. The last time the squad reached this stage was when the current seniors were themselves just young freshmen.
“It’s a huge honor [to compete in this tournament]. We love being able to play in it, and we don’t always get to and it’s not always a guarantee,” captain Michelle Xie said. “It’s always so much fun to be able to play with other teams. I haven’t done so since freshman year and everyone else on the team hasn’t played in NCAA Regionals yet so it’s definitely really special.”
This will easily be the tallest task that the Crimson has faced all year. Instead of its normal Ancient Eight competition, the group will be going up against some of the nation’s best teams. The field in this Midwest Regional includes schools like Stanford, Arizona, Kent State, UCLA, and the host Michigan State.
That being said, there is not much that Harvard can do to influence the performance of these other teams. Instead, it must focus on how its own game will play out.
“I think we’re just trying to do our best and make sure that we’re doing everything we can to ensure our optimal performance,” freshman Elizabeth Wang said. “[It’s all about] just trying our best and seeing how far we can run with it.”
Wang has been a big spark in her first year of collegiate competition. She leads the team with a 71.90 stroke average over 10 rounds of play and has carded a team best single round score of 69. Wang also became the Ivy League Individual Champion by notching the best solo score at the Ivy League Championship.
“I’ve always loved the game and I’ve always wanted to see how I can improve,” Wang said. “Especially with college, the team provides a huge amount of support and I’m very grateful for them. They are amazing people, each with their own motivations and desires and passions, and it’s great for all of us to support each other.”
This is the second consecutive year that a Crimson golfer was crowned the Ancient Eight Individual Champion. The year before, Xie was the one who took home the award.
Despite not replicating the feat this season, the senior has still had an impressive finale to her Harvard career. Xie has earned a top 10 finish in a tournament this year and her 76.13 stroke average is the third best on the team. Xie’s fellow senior Anna Zhou has also turned in strong performances in her last run.
However, as these two are finishing off their last run, there are several young faces who are just getting started. Anina Ku and Chloe Royston round out a freshman class that should give Crimson golf much optimism for the future.
“I think there’s a lot of strength in our freshmen this year,” Xie said. “It’s really great because they come in with a bunch of energy and they’re ready to practice more and always add more to the team. They’re so enthusiastic about everything we do.”
Nevertheless, there is still unfinished business in this current spring season. Every member of the team will need to perform at their best in order for Harvard to make a splash at NCAA Regionals. The competition will be stiff but this is an opportunity that every athlete lives for.
