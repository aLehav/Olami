Cambridge police said that they've received several calls about the earthquake but haven't received any reports of injuries or damages.
Michael Bradford, a librarian at the Harvard Divinity School, said on Twitter that he was in a kitchen at the school when he felt the earthquake.
"We thought it was construction trucks rumbling by, but it kept going," Bradford said.
Another Twitter user said that he was on the 13th floor of William James Hall when he felt the shake.
