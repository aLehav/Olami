After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Canadian academic David L. Johnston '63 will take the seat of governor general on October 1 to serve as the de facto head of state and representative of the Queen.
Johnston, who will succeed Michaëlle Jean as governor general of Canada, currently serves as president of the University of Waterloo and was the only chair on the Board of Overseers—the University's second-highest governing board—to not hold a U.S. citizenship.
 
As governor general, Johnston will be entrusted with many of the Queen’s constitutional and ceremonial duties, and has the power to summon parliament and grant Royal Assent on the Queen’s behalf.
“As the representative of the Queen of Canada, who is our country’s head of state, I pledge to be a stalwart defender of our Canadian heritage,” Johnston said in a statement.
Johnston, a specialist in securities regulation and corporation law who has authored numerous books, is no stranger to the world of academia. Educated at Harvard and later at Cambridge and Queen's Universities, Johnston began to work as an assistant professor at the Faculty of Law at Queen's University in 1966 and would go on to hold positions at the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario. Before assuming the presidency at Waterloo, Johnston served as the principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University.
Johnston has also chaired various scientific and public policy committees, such as the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, the National Task Force on High Speed Broadband Access, and Ontario's Infertility and Adoption Review Panel.
“Mr. Johnston has a strong record of public service, a broad base of support and an impressive list of achievements,” said Prime Minister Stephen Harper in a news release, adding that Johnston "represents the best of Canada."
But Johnston’s work has not been without controversy. His impartiality was called into question upon his work as an independent adviser in the public inquiry into the Airbus affair, a scandal that involved Prime Minister Brian Mulroney—for whom Johnston had once worked.
Before scaling his way to the top of the political scene in Canada, Johnston was a “pretty serious” and “straightforward” undergraduate who struck a rare balance between academics and athletics at Harvard, according to freshman year roommate George R. Finn Jr. ’63.
Johnston, a former Dunster House resident, played as a defenseman for the men's hockey team and was selected twice for the All-American Hockey Team, even earning himself a place in Harvard's Athletic Hall of Fame.
 
“He was an extraordinary person even then, and he was a great hockey player—an unusual combination,” Finn said. "[His success] would not surprise anyone who knew him. He was a hard worker."
Johnston is reportedly the model for one of the characters in "Love Story," the bestselling novel written by Erich W. Segal ’58, with whom Johnston became friends and running partners during their time at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ted Minnis has coached at just about every conceivable level of amateur water polo. He’s coached youth teams, he’s coached club teams, and he’s coached high school teams—sometimes all at the same time.
But Minnis, a 19-year coaching veteran, has never coached a college team.
That will change Sep. 4 when Minnis will stand on the pool deck at MIT with the Harvard men’s water polo team in its first contest of the 2010 season.
On Friday, Harvard athletics director Bob Scalise announced Minnis as the new head coach of both the Crimson’s men’s and women’s water polo squads. He will take over for Erik Farrar, who stepped down in May after six seasons at the helm.
“I’ve coached college-level athletes and I have had a lot of kids go on to play in college, so I know how [to work with college-level athletes],” Minnis said. “I am just going to keep doing what I’ve been doing. I’m not going to come in and try and reinvent the wheel.”
What Minnis has been doing has led his teams to success.
During his 11-year tenure as head coach of the Castilleja School girls’ water polo team,
Minnis’ squad reached five Central Coast Section semifinals and made one finals appearance.
As coach at the Stanford Club, a post he held simultaneously with his position at Castilleja, Minnis took home a US Club Championship and two bronze medals at the Junior Olympics.
These accomplishments helped Minnis earn the head coaching position for the Olympic
Development Program Pacific Zone three years ago. Since he took over, his team has earned two silver medals at the 16 and Under Olympic Development Regional Championship and Zone Championship.
But none of these coaching positions could keep Minnis from moving east when he was offered the Harvard job.
“It’s a great opportunity at a great institution,” Minnis said. “I couldn’t pass up that
opportunity.”
Minnis learned of the job opening through a handful of players he had coached who had gone on to play for the Crimson. Minnis’ former players encouraged him to apply for the job.
“I was obviously flattered,” he said.
Minnis sent in his resume, and after a phone interview, Harvard flew him across the country to visit Cambridge on June 17. A former history major, Minnis was immediately struck by the historical significance and older architecture of the Boston area.
“It’s so beautiful [in Cambridge],” Minnis said. “I was just so excited. I knew at that point if I had the opportunity to coach at Harvard, [I would take it].”
When Minnis was offered the job two weeks later, he jumped on it.
Since Minnis took up the post, he has been moving quickly to familiarize himself with his two teams, contacting players and organizing in-person meetings with players who live close to him in California.
Soon Minnis will receive tape of his two teams from last season so he can begin to get a sense of how his new players perform in the pool.
“I am really excited [to receive the tapes] to get to know the team,” Minnis said. “It’s just a process of getting to know each other as athletes and as people.”
Minnis has just less than two months to prepare for the upcoming men’s season that kicks off in early September. The men’s team, which hasn’t finished above .500 since 2004, is looking to get back on track after a 7-17 season last year. The women’s team fared slightly better, finishing 12-15, but dropped its final five contests.
“We look forward to working with Ted to move our water polo programs forward in their quest to be one of the top teams in the Collegiate Water Polo Association,” said Scalise, according to gocrimson.com.
But while a handful of weeks may not seem like a long time to prepare for one’s first season as a collegiate head coach, for someone used to coaching all year round, it feels like a long time.
“I haven’t been on the pool deck for 11 days,” Minnis said. “I am actually going a little crazy.”

A casual stroll through the Yard may have brought a doleful sight to your environmentally-conscious eyes. The American elm tree that once stood staidly in the patch of grass behind Weld and University Hall has been reduced to a sad ol' stump.
Nazneen P. Cooper, assistant dean for campus design, said that the elm in the Yard had been infected with Dutch Elm disease, a re-occurring problem with old elms.
Dutch Elm disease first plagued Harvard's trees in 1978, according to Wayne P. Carbone, manager of landscape services. The disease, which affects the vascular system of the tree, is spread by elm bark beetles and root grafting. It has been a problem in the Yard and the rest of the campus courtyards because too many trees were planted too close together over 100 years ago.
Indeed, the recent leafy victim of the diease is not the first tree to have gone in its vicinity. Two other elms in that area were cut in the past three years.
To prevent further spreading of the disease, recent landscape efforts have introduced a variety of new tree species to Harvard's green pastures.
"It is our responsibility to make sure that the trees on our campus are and remain healthy," Cooper said. "If there is a particular tree infected with an incurable disease, then we have keep it alive as long as feasible until we have to cut it down to sterilize the area and make sure the disease doesn't spread to surrounding healthy trees."
So have no fear! The University has plans of replacing this particular elm as well as a few others over the next year.  For now, enjoy the bit of extra light as you pass through the Yard.

A man who allegedly groped a 16-year-old girl on a Red Line train at the Kendall T station surrendered to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police Friday morning.
Joseph Joyce, 27, turned himself in at Transit Police headquarters at 8 a.m. after the police obtained a warrant for his arrest. The Scituate, Mass. native was charged with indecent assault and battery, according to MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo.
Joyce was arraigned in Cambridge District Court earlier today and released on $1,000 cash bail, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office said in a press release.
He is due in court on August 20 for a pre-trial conference.
The Boston Globe reported that Joyce was also wanted in connection to a similar incident on Monday in a Shaw’s supermarket in Cohasset, Mass., where he allegedly brushed up against a 40-year-old woman and lifted her skirt.
His arrest comes just two days after a girl informed Transit Police that a man reached for and pulled down her shirt. Security cameras captured the image of a suspect fleeing the station, and the photograph was then posted on news websites and “Wanted” posters.
The attack was the first of two assaults on Wednesday against teenage girls in Cambridge. The suspect in the second assault—a man who, according to Cambridge Police, tried to lure a 15-year-old girl with candy and then repeatedly grabbed her arm—is still at large.
