After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One night after Twenty One Pilots questioned whether or not they deserved to be headliners, Tame Impala left no doubt that they deserved their spot on the big stage. Through a mix of older hits and newer singles, the Kevin Parker-led outfit invited the crowd on an emotional journey through change, heartbreak, and acceptance. For Tame Impala, some things change other things remain consistent. At Boston Calling, Tame Impala’s slowly changing but still recognizable Saturday night set was nothing short of breathtaking.
Tame Impala played to a significantly larger crowd than Twenty One Pilots the night before, and the true barometer of their set was their ability to retain that crowd throughout the evening. Whereas a decent amount of the Twenty One Pilots crowd left before the end of their performance, Tame Impala’s crowd stayed relatively the same size and pushed ever further to the front. While the pit had less room to dance, they had more room to move as one — bobbing their heads and raising their fists when Parker’s beats called for it. Nowhere was this more evident than in the song “Elephant” off Tame Impala’s 2012 album “Lonerism.” A driving bass line and ferocious intensity from the band complemented the crowds shouts and cheers.
Although Twenty One Pilots had more spectacle in their performance — lead singer Tyler Joseph climbed a stage fixture and drummer Josh Dun battled against a pre-recorded version of himself — Tame Impala still left their mark through coordinated bursts of confetti and dazzling light shows. Confetti bombarded the crowd from multiple sides during a drop in set-opener, “Let It Happen.” The scanning lights during “Eventually” served as a ceiling on the audience, albeit one that the crowd’s energy threatened to break through. The band left the stage after the main set, entreating the crowd to an engrossing display of lights and bass on an empty stage as they cheered the band back on. The confetti that burst during closer “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” reinforced the message that while Tame Impala took a bit of time off, they are still the same energetic band.
The band was at its best during the long, sprawling outros on many of its popular songs. The aforementioned “Let It Happen” ran for almost 10 minutes. Both “Eventually” and the main set’s last song “Apocalypse Dreams” brought back the beat after the stage went dark, keeping the song going. Deeper cuts like “Why Won’t You Make Up Your Mind?” and “Love/Paranoia” showed Parker’s range and enriched the set’s variety. The Australian band also showed tongue-in-cheek self-awareness with their lack of knowledge surrounding Memorial Day. “Is that a thing?” quipped Parker. “I do know it’s Saturday night!”
New singles indicated that more is still to come from Tame Impala. While some fans may have purchased tickets hoping Parker would release his fourth Tame Impala album prior to the festival, the band took its time putting together new material. Parker jokes in “Patience” that he lost track of time after 2015’s “Currents.” Commenting on the audience’s intoxication, he also let slip that he was on painkillers after falling off a roof. When asked by a band member why he was on the roof in the first place, he casually said he was filming something. Whether he was filming a music video or the fall delayed recording plans is unclear. Still, while the Boston audience did not hear any new songs, that breadcrumb alone may help satiate Tame Impala fans moving forward. It will also comfort fans that both new singles — “Patience” and “Borderline” — were seamlessly incorporated into the set and incredibly well-received by the crowd.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On set closer “Melt,” the members of Big Red Machine repeatedly yelled, “Well, you are who you are” to the crowd, signaling the end to a long journey but also the start of another. This mission statement of sorts acknowledged the band’s imperfections and rough edges while affirming their existence as a grand experiment.
Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Aaron Dessner of The National founded the indie outfit as a collaboration for the Red Hot Organization’s “Dark Was the Night” compilation. Dessner forwarded Vernon an instrumental he titled “Big Red Machine,” a nickname for the dominant iteration of his hometown Cincinnati Reds. Vernon interpreted the title as a reference to the human heart and wrote his lyrics accordingly. For many artists, the story would have stopped after the release of the benefit album, but Vernon and Dessner kept in touch. Ten years later, as the story goes, there are now 10 songs between the two. They formally became Big Red Machine and released a self-titled debut last year under the PEOPLE collective, formed by Vernon, Dessner, and Dessner’s twin brother Bryan.
On stage, Big Red Machine was fluid and dynamic. Vernon often used a modulator to create a similar sound to his most recent Bon Iver album, “22, A Million.” Dessner alternated between playing guitar and piano. Not everything worked perfectly. Vernon’s lyrics at many points were indecipherable. Some knowledgeable fans kept singing along, some hummed the melody, and others made up their own lyrics. But whereas some bands lose their appeal in live performances when the words are lost, Vernon allowed listeners to take a step back and hear each composition in its entirety, focusing on each member’s unique contributions. That is a tougher listen, but arguably a more complete one.
When Dessner announced the band would play a few new songs, the crowd watched the artistic process take place in front of them. One of these songs, titled “I Can’t Be All You Got” — or “Langham,” depending on who you ask — was first released as a live improvisation from the band. Another new cut does not have a formal title, but fans christened it “Reese.” Sometimes this artistic process took a break, such as when the band members passed around a joint after “Langham.” But the band left much up to the listener, paradoxically creating a group bond that superseded individual tastes and perceptions.
In this light, naming the collective Big Red Machine makes sense. The differing interpretations from Vernon and Dessner on the meaning of that initial track signals the varying perspectives Big Red Machine encompasses. 40 people collaborated on the album, an aspect the band tried to replicate live by recruiting two Berklee students to play brass instruments. Everything the group does is open to interpretation. The “Big Red Machine” album cover may be a silhouette of a chest or, as some fans theorized, an ancient design of what the heart may look like. Impressionistic lyrics like “Well there ain’t no other other” from “Gratitude” and “Through the clock / There’s a way to go” from “OMDB” mean different things to different people. And that’s exactly the point. Fans looking for the soothing ballads of early Bon Iver or the darker portraits of The National should look elsewhere. Those aspects exist in Big Red Machine, but its unifying sonic theme is that there is no real theme, that different sounds will come together and interact in new ways. On the stage, this became clear through extended instrumental breaks that allow members to riff on different melodies. The flexibility of each performance becomes clear when Vernon aggressively points up or down to try different mixes in the middle of different songs.
Each cut sounds like its counterpart on the album on the surface, but Big Red Machine takes some songs in different directions. The album outro of “OMDB” is ethereal, but in Boston, it sounded much more grounded and dark, as Vernon aggressively shouted, “Over my dead body” over a cacophony of drums and guitar. “I Won’t Run From It,” one of the few songs with a genuine — albeit ever-changing — hook, became an opportunity for the audience to sing along with Vernon. Changes like these, along with Dessner repeatedly thanking the audience for listening, contributed to a vibe of experimentation and development.
The future remains unclear for Big Red Machine. This year’s 37d03d Festival — or PEOPLE upside down — in Brooklyn brought together many bands and collaborations, but Big Red Machine did not feel like the focus of the event. Dessner will eventually have to tour with The National for their new album, and Vernon announced new tour dates for Bon Iver. With grueling schedules and other ambitious projects, it seems unlikely Vernon and Dessner will have the time to devote to something as large as Big Red Machine on a regular basis moving forward. After all, this tour culminated over a decade of collaboration. But the new tracks leave the door open for more collaboration in the future, and the growing network of PEOPLE musicians entertains the possibility that the group will have new members moving forward. As they showed on the stage this weekend, Big Red Machine is more than the sum of its parts, even if those parts constantly change. They are who they are, but the ideals they stand for are something much bigger than themselves.

In a set at Boston Calling filled with re-dos and walk-offs, Logic cemented his status as one of rap’s most divisive live acts. For his fans, he filled his set with stellar renditions of classics and a healthy amount of new material — but to others, the Maryland-born rapper was petulant at times, something that bringing out a secret guest did not fix. Onlookers’ preconceptions about Logic’s music and performance heavily shaped their experiences — but it was utterly disgraceful how the rapper could be so openly hostile with his crowd and still seek exorbitant praise.
The above is not to take away from Logic’s strong start. With songs like “44 More” and “Everybody,” he displayed his lyrical prowess and speedy delivery. After “44 More,” he spoke on his message of “peace, love, and positivity” and how those were the guiding principles in his life and music career. When he paused to take a breather after “Overnight,” it was clear that he was giving a lot to this performance. He seemed genuine, and it made sense that he demanded the same from the crowd, urging them to fully give themselves to the music and not just passively listen. Then things went south.
There are two ways to interpret what Logic did over the rest of his set. Either he really meant all of the things he said about the crowd lacking energy and not wanting to perform for them, or he just trolling them and passion and being genuine is a one-way street. If you are not a Logic stan, both of these situations are enough to get you to tune out and walk away. But for those who gave themselves fully to Logic, this was downright abusive.
Logic stopped the track “Homicide” halfway through to note that the crowd lacked energy. He then finished the track and moved onto “Killing Spree,” which he also stopped since the crowd allegedly did not give him enough. Logic then brought on Joyner Lucas to perform “ISIS” — a live debut — and “I Love,” a nice departure from the previous two songs, but then Lucas rambled like a hostage at gunpoint explaining how he had misread Logic and that he was actually a really nice person. Logic then bragged about his bestselling book and about his new album full of “fun a**-f**king music.” At that point, it seemed like he was back to being a self-confident rapper, and he even expressed his displeasure on the division of the crowd down the middle — never mind that he compared himself to Moses while doing so. After a cover of Queen’s “We Will Rock You,” seemingly performed to remind his audience that they his speaking voice is preferable, he catapulted into 2014’s “Under Pressure.” Logic cut the song short again and sarcastically asked the crowd if they needed a break from this “overload of raw hip-hop.” Finally, during “Midnight,” Logic declared the show to be over and walked off the stage, asking for his check.
Logic’s DJ correctly diagnosed what transpired between the rapper and the crowd as “relationship issues.” The crowd tried to cheer him back on. When that failed, the DJ suggested booing. Then the crowd cheered again as Logic reemerged. He was back to his normal self for most of the rest of the set, but much of the crowd watched in a daze after the walk-off. Planned or not — and it was probably planned — the act of walking off stage is the last resort, a nuclear option that alienated much of the audience. Logic’s diehards may have been fine with this — some may have even been expecting it — but a decent chunk of the audience took it as an opportunity to get a better spot for Travis Scott’s headlining act.
After these antics, the rest of Logic’s set felt trivial. His cover of The Sugarhill Gang’s “Apache” felt silly. “100 Miles and Running” came off as braggadocious. Even his hit “1-800-273-8255” felt rushed as he started to run over his allotted time. He fit in “Everyday” before exiting the stage for good, leaving his fans in awe and neutral onlookers in disbelief. For someone as devoted to the craft as Logic is, it is a bad sign when the spectacle overtakes the music during a live performance. Whether this was a one-time hiccup or (more likely) all part of the script, one can only hope that Logic turns things around and sticks to his mantra of peace and love, because for a rapper who claims that he “still ain’t hit my peak” at age 29, his set at Boston Calling felt like a new low.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Grammy-nominated Irish rock singer Hozier opened his Saturday evening set with a rendition of “Would That I” as the sun set on the penultimate day of Boston Calling, he set the tone for a serene performance — a serenity that would nonetheless morph into the powerful, activist contrarianism of his last piece “Take Me To Church.” Equipped with a guitar and a true and crisp live voice, as well as guitarists, a percussionist, and an organist, Hozier offered a clean performance fit for mass appeal.
During some songs, columns of saturated yellow lighting lined the back of the stage, while at other times an intriguing display included an underwater armchair or a backlit, neon, gauzy curtain-like setup. It occasionally made it difficult to see Hozier’s face without viewing it on the display, which made little sense for a singer whose raw and authentic voice drew crowds. The music style of other acts, like Saturday night headliner Tame Impala, permitted an elusive stage appearance. Violet or electric blue overhead stage lights that illuminated the smoky air nonetheless fed into a soft aesthetic that complemented the depth and roughness of Hozier’s voice. Often rendering the organist, other band members, or Hozier in sepia, the displays contributed to the folksy vibe of songs like “Almost” and “Nobody.” After Hozier progressed through almost the entire setlist, however, maintaining the same unconvincing, falsely evocative video filters or profile shots of the artist playing his guitar as he sang into the planted microphone became wearisome.
The concert amounted to everything expectable from a several-hit indie musician. No element surprised, nor did any disappoint. Familiarity with Hozier made the lights brighter and his melodies more heart-wrenching, but the concert experience would be enjoyable to any. Hozier’s live performance was only fulfilling — in fact, exhilarating — because of his musical talent. He generates profound lyrical messages and lessons, whether relatable or moving. Hozier explores questions of free love and the political acceptance of humankind boldly within his music. For example, the song “Someone New” that he performed early on broaches the reality of widespread, easy love, as opposed to the more widely-accepted long-term, straight, monogamous love that contemporary music speaks of. In the music video, the protagonist fantasizes about men and women who are strangers to her. The influence of intersecting blues, rock, and folk genres in his music culminates in a style rooted in both tradition and originality.
While Hozier sang “Take Me To Church” with a slightly augmented passion than the preceding songs, the black-and-white footage of the Russian anti-gay violence scenes of the music video streamed on the display behind him on stage. As his first theatrical use of the screen, the video of traumatic rights violations drew special audience attention. It elevated the impact of his much-awaited final song, and distinguished it from the rest of his discography. “Take Me To Church” is a cut above in heaviness and the way in which it has been recognized, while speaking to a common theme of unconventional or threatened love.
As a concert performer, Hozier was mundane, but as a musician, he outrivals — which serves as insurance and fortification to subpar concert style. With Hozier, there was no need to be innovative. While other headliners like Travis Scott achieved new heights with their concert style, Hozier’s sufficed. He contributed to Boston Calling merely for being part of the lineup, and for singing his set.
