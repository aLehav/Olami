After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her recent appointment to a national commission on the BP oil spill, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray will draw upon decades of experience in managing engineers and scientists—an asset that colleagues say will prove fundamental to her government charge. 
 
The creation of the National Commission  on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling came on the heels of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico—considered the largest offshore spill in U.S. history—that resulted from a drilling rig explosion in April. The group has been tasked with providing recommendations to prevent future spills.
Murray joins the commission after spending her first year at the helm of SEAS, where she launched broad efforts to expand the school's footprint within Harvard, initiated a multi-year program to convert individual tracks in Engineering Science into discrete concentrations, and increased national awareness of developments within SEAS.
But Murray's past year as a top-level administrator at SEAS is only the most recent capstone of decades of prior experience that many say might actually prove more helpful in her new government role than her administrative tenure at Harvard.
Murray has an extensive history in managing scientists and engineers in their research at Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where she led 3,500 employees as the lab's principal associate director.
“I think that Dean Murray—especially  after the Livermore Labs—has broad management skills in science and  technology that will be necessary for her work on the commission,” said Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, former dean of SEAS.
Murray's management skills, supplemented with her exposure to the intellectual riches of Harvard, provides the dean a deep understanding of risk management systems—an asset that will inform her contributions to a commission that ultimately seeks to shape the way that the government responds to oil spill catastrophes.
“This [job  on the commission] requires a sort of dispassionate look—her distance  might allow her to see things that insiders might not recognize,”  Venky said. “If you take Livermore Labs, they have some of the very  large laser facilities and they make nuclear weapons: Dean Murray had  to manage complex systems in that environment and manage the risks in  those complex systems.”
Indeed, some believe that Murray's work on the commission mandates an awareness of the complexity of harnessing an engineering team, moreso than direct experience with fuel science.
Geophysics and Engineering Sciences Professor James R. Rice said that while he does not think Murray has "any specific experience" with oil- and petroleum-related issues, Murray's time at Livermore Labs represents a crucial element of her work history that "properly equips" Murray for her role on the commission.
The seven members of the bipartisan commission, created by an executive order from President Barack Obama, will have their first meeting in mid-July, according to The New York Times.
Rice, who said  that he was “astonished by the rate at which the oil was coming out,”  said that creating a committee in which all members are highly knowledgeable about every detail of the committee's charge—in this case, the BP oil spill—is nearly impossible, particularly given the sheer size of the current catastrophe. A committee with members who specialize in different, yet relevant, areas of the issue at hand is a better fit to deal with complex disasters, Rice said.
This type of commission is not uncommon in the wake of such a large calamity, according to Kennedy School Professor Herman “Dutch” B. Leonard ’74, who specializes in crisis management.
“I think it was done because it makes sense to do,” Leonard said, adding that the executive order that established the commission, which he believes will succeed in mitigating future similar disasters, piggybacks on current high public outrage regarding the dangers of unregulated offshore drilling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric Balderas '13, who faced possible deportation earlier this month and was granted deferred action on Friday, will be permitted to stay in the United States indefinitely, The Boston Globe reported today.
While U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can still revoke the deferral, Balderas may continue studying at Harvard without facing the threat of deportation.
Balderas, who immigrated illegally to the United States from Mexico with his family when he was 4, was detained in San Antonio, Texas when trying to board a plane to Boston with a consulate card and his Harvard identification.
Balderas, an aspiring molecular and cellular biology concentrator in Eliot House, became the center of national debate about undocumented youth in the country and immigration reform.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I signed on to spend my summer outside of Durban, South Africa, I knew that soccer would be a major part of my experience. Even as an American who, before arriving in South Africa at the end of May, could count the number of international soccer players I could name on two hands, I could appreciate that the first-ever World Cup on African soil would be a big deal. I just didn’t know how big.
The country has been absolutely overcome with World Cup fever, and I decided I didn’t want to miss out. So last Saturday, a friend and I decided to shell out the big bucks and get tickets to one of the Durban-hosted matches—the group-play contest between the Netherlands and Japan.
I’ve been to big sports games before, both at Harvard and for my hometown pro teams. I had thought that the atmosphere at the 2004 ALCS game between the Red Sox and Yankees I attended would be hard to top. But the World Cup was an experience that was totally and completely unique. I had never seen so many supporters dressed in such elaborate costumes—Japanese fans in full traditional garb, banging on drums, and a group of a dozen Dutch supporters decked out in orange flight attendant outfits, complete with orange platform boots for the ladies. From the pre-match ceremony to the final whistle, the stadium never stopped buzzing with the sounds of cheers and vuvuzelas. There were flags everywhere—and not just Dutch and Japanese flags. One proclaimed “Forever England,” which I thought a bold move considering England’s dreadful performance in a 0-0 draw with Algeria the night before, and there was also a Swedish flag hanging below the second section. Sweden didn’t qualify for the tournament, but it can take solace in the fact that it’s still got some incredibly proud supporters.
The game ended with a 1-0 win for the Netherlands—a victory that made the Dutch the second team to guarantee its spot in the round of 16. My friend and I had been hoping for a goalfest, and even though we didn’t get it, it was a game that was engrossing all the way through. Never again will I knock soccer as a dull game based on its lack of scoring. And though the game seemed too short after the weeks of buildup and the money spent on the ticket, it was worth every penny.
Though I won’t be in the stadium for any more matches, South Africa is still an incredible place to be this month. Vuvuzelas play throughout the countryside all day, every day, and every Bafana Bafana match is an excuse for the country to take a three-hour break and watch some soccer. It’s been extraordinary to watch this country come together in pride over hosting such a major international event, and I can’t wait to be a part of it as the knockout rounds unfold.

In the largest water polo conference in the country, no one made a bigger splash when he was out of the pool than Egen Atkinson, the recently graduated co-captain of the 2009 Harvard team. On June 18, the two-meter defender was named the Collegiate Water Polo Association’s Scholar-Athlete of the Year.
“I’d say that he’s someone we all looked up to,” said classmate Nikhil Balaraman, who will live with Atkinson next year. “There’s no one more deserving…I think we all saw it coming. He’s a very deserving recipient.”
The award, established only a year ago, is based on a points system that awards achievements in community service, academics, and individual excellence in water polo. The first two categories were the key for Atkinson. Academically, he was a four-time CWPA Scholar-Athlete and a three-time Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches All-Academic Pick.
An economics concentrator headed to medical school, Atkinson managed to maintain a 3.821 grade point average despite balancing schoolwork, Division I water polo, and numerous community service commitments, which included Health Volunteers Overseas, the Mission Hill After School Program, and Unite for Sight.
“He never really seems to have any time,” Balaraman said. “Somehow he seems to get it all done even though it seems like there’s no time left.”
Balaraman says that Atkinson is currently on a community service trip in Honduras with Unite for Sight.
“Instead of going on vacation, he’s gone to help different people,” Balaraman said. “It’s helped him find a passion for medicine…The community service has been more that just a line on a resume—it’s been a way for him to gain meaningful and fulfilling experiences. It’s amazing that he fits it into his schedule. It’s even more amazing that it’s something he’s so passionate about.”
