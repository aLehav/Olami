After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shifting course after he announced his departure in November, Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria will stay in his post through December 2020, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in an email Thursday.
Last fall, Nohria wrote that he would step down on June 30 after ten years leading the country’s premier business school. But the challenges Harvard will face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic led him to extend his stay, Bacow wrote.
In his email to Business School affiliates, Bacow cited Nohria’s “judgement, deep experience, and steady hand” as the school navigates “unprecedented circumstances.”
“Such near-term continuity during an uncertain time will serve HBS and Harvard well. It will also help ensure that Provost Garber and I can give the ongoing dean search the full attention it deserves, on a somewhat extended time horizon, as we continue working toward the selection of HBS’s next leader,” he wrote.
Bacow also wrote that he was grateful to Nohria for his willingness to alter plans during a period of considerable changes. The Business School, like many other Harvard institutions, cancelled meetings of more than 25 people and shifted to remote classes in line with University policies.
“I am extremely grateful to Nitin for his willingness to alter his plans – an act of institutional commitment wholly characteristic of his profound devotion to HBS and to the University,” Bacow wrote.
“I am similarly grateful to the many people across the HBS community who have contacted me with advice and suggestions during the course of the search so far,” he added. “Your perspectives have already been invaluable, and they will continue to inform our ongoing effort.”
Much like Bacow, Nohria and Business School Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi wrote about the historic challenges the virus will present on campus in an email last week.
“The last time we had to pivot our operations so significantly was in the 1940s, against the backdrop of World War II, when the School's campus (and that of the University) was turned over to military training,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard Square shops have temporarily shut their doors in response to growing health and safety concerns related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Retail stores that have temporarily closed include the Harvard Coop, the Harvard Book Store, Zinnia Jewelry, Felix Shoe Repair, and Patagonia’s Cambridge location.
These closures come after Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 issued an emergency order Sunday “prohibiting on-premises consumption of food or drink at bars and restaurants” and “limiting gatherings to 25 individuals.”
Jeremiah P. Murphy, Jr., ’73, president of the Coop, said concerns about the safety of employees and customers was a key reason for the store’s temporary closure.
“There’s a real concern obviously for the employees and the patrons who come into the store in terms of the whole COVID-19 situation,” Murphy said. “We certainly don’t want to put our employees at risk or any more risk being in a retail environment — and the same thing for patrons coming in.”
Murphy added that new state requirements, such as limiting gatherings to 25 people, also contributed to the decision to close.
“Just from our employee point of view, we have more than 25 employees,” he said.
Alex W. Meriwether, general manager of the Harvard Book Store, said closing the store has brought challenges to its mission to be an “open, accessible, safe community gathering place.”
“Finding creative ways to reach out to our community while having our doors closed to the public has been what we’ve all been thinking about these last few days,” he said. “Online business has definitely been a regular part of our business for many years, but shifting it to be the main part of our business, for the time being, has been a challenge.”
Meriwether said the store will focus on phone and online orders that can be shipped for free or picked up curbside.
“Call when you pull up outside and pop your trunk and we’ll contactlessly pop your books in your trunk,” he said.
“We have a table set up so we can place the books in a bag on the table and maintain the recommended six feet social distancing,” he added.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said some stores initially tried to remain open through the pandemic but ultimately closed due to a lack of customers.
“A few said ‘Oh, we’re gonna try and stay open and see what happens.’ And then, of course, with so few people on the street and retail shopping, it just didn’t make sense,” she said. “Other shops are going to give it a shot and see what happens, but I suspect that it will be more costly for them in the long run.”
“The number of people that we’ve seen in the Square is diminishing daily,” she added.
Some Harvard Square stores currently remain open to the public, including Brattle Square Florist, Grolier Poetry Bookshop, tobacco shop Leavitt and Peirce, and roughly a dozen others.
Some representatives from the stores that have closed said they will continue to monitor the situation daily.
“We’re looking at it at a day-to-day basis about what’s happening and if we have to change our plans, or whatever, so it’s kind of a fluid situation,” Murphy said.

Harvard’s transition to online instruction could serve as an unprecedented learning experience for both faculty and students, according to virtual education experts at the Graduate School of Education.
Though the new model poses various logistical challenges and raises questions of educational equity, it could also present opportunities for innovation and help prepare students for the future, per the experts.
All University courses will move to remote instruction beginning after spring recess, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in an email to Harvard affiliates March 10. Even before the official announcement, the University had instructed faculty on how to use Zoom, an online learning and screen sharing platform.
David A. Dockterman, a lecturer in the Technology, Innovation, and Education program, said the shift to virtual instruction would mark an entry into uncharted territory for both professors and students.
“In the short term, it’s going to be a lot of experimentation,” Dockterman said. “I think we should expect a lot of fits and starts as people are mastering both the technical elements of this shift and also experimenting with new pedagogical elements.”
Associate Dean for Learning and Teaching Matthew L. Miller cited a lack of broadband access as a potential barrier to achieving an equitable learning environment.
“I’m worried about the things that are especially hard for us to control in the communities in which students are living,” he said. “They will require us to be very flexible, understanding, and in close partnership with students about what they're experiencing.”
In recognition of potential sources of inequity, student groups at Yale and Stanford have called for more lenient grading policies. Harvard undergraduates have circulated a petition proposing a “Double A” system, in which students would receive either an A or A- for all classes this semester.
But some education experts said students and faculty should attempt to make the best of the opportunity.
Professor in Learning Technologies Christopher J. Dede said the “skills” gained from online learning could prove “very important” in students’ future endeavors.
“Whatever it merits in an academic setting, it’s going to be very important in a global digital economy,” he said. “Having some practice in academic settings with learning how to do that well is a bonus.”
“Hopefully, Harvard facing this crisis will develop some really interesting and powerful models that come out of the smart faculty and students that are part of this community,” he added.
Miller said that maintaining cohesiveness with classmates in the months ahead will be essential in smoothing the transition to virtual instruction.
“The idea of staying connected and learning together is really important,” he said. “But what I’m seeing is a lot of faculty really interested in making sure that students feel connected to one another and feel like we can do it together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students from schools across the University formed a group called Students vs. Pandemics this week aimed at centralizing advocacy and resources in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Gwendolyn Lee — a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and one of the group’s co-founders — said Students vs. Pandemics and its COVID-19 Task Force has three primary goals: to improve transparency and communication, to build community, and to identify problems across the University caused by the global disease outbreak.
Much of the group’s work is centralized on a Google Sheet, with sections of information to help students “stay healthy,” “find resources,” “have fun,” and “support community.”
Lee said she and her sister, Alexandria Y. Lee — a student at the Harvard School of Public Health — decided to start the organization after discussing the coronavirus pandemic's impact on their classmates.
“In times of crisis and rapid change, there’s a huge need for information and rapidly updated information, but at the same time it can be challenging to sift through everything that's circulating, to find transparent and accurate information,” Lee said. “So we saw a need to improve transparency and communication.”
The group also hopes to inform students about what they can do to further “systemic change” on the issue. A tab on the Google Sheet suggests projects like translating public health information and compiling various states’ economic relief actions.
Laura A. Jenny ’21, who is in charge of the group’s outreach to the College, said she is focused on compiling resources for students to maintain their mental health while away from campus and in isolation.
“We’re also going to have a team on mental health and wellness, a team addressing different community service projects, thinking about what resources we can bring to the greater Cambridge and greater Boston areas,” Jenny said. “We’re also trying to do a COVID-19 Hackathon, which is going to be a space for students from all across the University to get together virtually to come up with innovative ideas on problem solving specific problems that are coming from the outbreak.”
Bryan O. Buckley, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he is most proud of a section of the Google Sheet dubbed “Complain + Fix,” where students can list coronavirus-related issues they have and solicit solutions from others. Items listed on the sheet include childcare refund problems, Commencement-related confusion, and visa queries.
“It’s okay for people to feel anxious and be angry and to go through all the maelstrom of emotions and just having an opportunity to put that frustration out there, because it gives us the opportunity to hear and see what are really truly worrying folks, and also for some folks that are able to be in the creative space, thinking about solutions that might be helpful for the University,” Buckley said.
Buckley — who is also the president of the Graduate Student Council — said he hopes that he can leverage his relationship with the Provost’s Office to help communicate problems and solutions to the administration.
“The more we can systemize everything and create communication, that helps a lot of administrators,” he said.
The Task Force currently includes undergraduates, students from the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Buckley and Lee said they are working to involve students from all twelve schools.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Department of Public Health declared a public health emergency Thursday evening as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, according to a press release.
The emergency declaration is designed to “facilitate and expedite” the use of resources to protect people from the virus, which has all but shuttered Harvard’s campus for the remainder of the semester.
Harvard announced March 10 that the University would transition to online classes as a result of the outbreak. Most students have since vacated campus, and only a few remain in residence, with restricted living and dining policies.
The city announced in the press release that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has awarded Cambridge $100,000 in emergency resources. The funding is part of a $5 million grant Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 issued to state health boards.
Cambridge will employ the grant to monitor and combat COVID-19 in the city by increasing surveillance, providing overtime for staff, and purchasing additional personal protective equipment.
“We are grateful to Governor Charlie Baker and his Administration for making this critical funding available to support public health as our city continues to respond to the challenges of COVID-19,” Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a joint statement.
The City of Cambridge previously announced a number of administrative measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. All “non-essential” city meetings have been cancelled, and the city’s public schools will remain closed until at least March 27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard-affiliated religious leaders and Cambridge religious centers are rethinking how they will approach their services and day-to-day conduct in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic.
Following a state-wide ban on gatherings of more than 25 people and Harvard’s recent decision to send students home, the University’s religious organizations and other local religious bodies are working to keep their communities connected while temporarily discontinuing their in-person services.
Memorial Church — an interdenominational Protestant church located at the center of Harvard Yard — cancelled all events at least through the end of April. The church is home to the interfaith network at Harvard, housing chaplains of different religious backgrounds.
Instead of in-person services, Memorial Church will record its Morning Prayers and make them available online. It will also continue to broadcast its Sunday worship service on WHRB, Harvard’s radio station.
Interim Pusey Minister Stephanie A. Paulsell said Memorial Church will find new ways of interacting and communicating with churchgoers, such as through daily emails containing music, student reflections, spiritual practices, and a prayer cumulative of the week’s prayer requests.
As the Christian church enters Lent — a period of penitential preparation for Easter — Paulsell said the church has been thinking about this year’s theme of Pilgrimage. The theme was originally chosen to reflect the church’s leadership transition as the University searches for a permanent minister.
“We had just passed the first Sunday of Lent when this all started happening,” she said. “The beginning of that journey is a journey in the wilderness, and we’re in it. We’re in the wilderness feeling our way along, trying to figure out how to accompany each other on this journey to Easter,” she said.
Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, the director at Harvard Chabad, said Chabad will not be conducting in-person events — including major events scheduled over the next few weeks — as they approach weekly Shabbat dinners and Passover.
“There are so many regular events that occur here and signature events that we convene as a community — none of which will be occurring until it is safe to do so,” he said.
Zarchi wrote in a follow-up email that Chabad will instead be sending “necessary elements required to conduct a Passover Seder” to students and their families.
“With the help of a caterer, we will ship Matzah and ‘Seders to go’ for all students and families who need it so that they can enjoy a healthy, Kosher, and happy Passover!” he wrote.
Zarchi said smaller discussion groups have already started communicating virtually. He added that while he recognizes students’ sadness and shock, he looks forward to when they can all celebrate again.
“We’ll come back,” he said. “We’ll have yet the happiest celebratory days for all seniors and grad students around the corner hopefully. But for now, of course, the central and primary message to a lot of students is that we ask them to please, please listen to guidelines of the authorities and just be safe.”
In an email sent over Harvard Hillel’s mailing list last Friday, Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg — the executive director of Harvard Hillel — wrote that he was moved by the love, support, and care shown at Harvard Hillel over the past week.
“It strikes me that we will all remember this sudden exodus from Harvard for the rest of our lives,” Steinberg wrote. “By that I mean, let’s find a fleetness in our feet and a hurry in our hearts, amid our personal rushing, to be present for one another, now and in the time into which we are embarking.”
In a message to The Crimson, Bilal Wurie ’21, the vice president of the Harvard Islamic Society, wrote that the organization is “moving forward as best as we can” following Bacow’s announcement to send students home.
"Community is a core aspect of the Islamic tradition, so this change is definitely a substantial hurdle, but we will overcome it,” Wurie wrote. “Like the multitude of mosques across the nation, our on-campus Jumuah (Friday) prayers and future Ramadan programming have been cancelled.”
Wurie added that the Harvard Islamic Society has plans to engage virtually and “maintain strong ties” with its members in the coming months.
The Cambridge Zen Center — a Zen Buddhist center located near Central Square — wrote in a March 11 announcement that while they will be closed to the public until May 1, they will continue to post virtual content and attempt live streaming practices in the near future.
“This is uncharted territory for us, having been open to the public seven days a week for the last forty-seven years,” the announcement reads. “It wasn’t a decision made lightly, but when weighing the pros and cons of potential disease transmission, it seemed wise to err on the side of caution for everyone’s benefit.”
The center is one of the largest residential Buddhist centers in North America and houses over thirty residents and extended non-residential guests, according to their website.
Saint Paul Parish — a Roman Catholic church in Harvard Square that is home to the Harvard Catholic Center — announced on its website that all masses, parish gatherings, ministries, and events have been canceled until further notice. While baptisms, confirmations, weddings, and funerals are allowed to proceed, attendance is advised to be limited to immediate family.
Senior Chaplain Reverend William T. Kelly said the church will remain open from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for private prayer and will continue to operate its Saturday morning food pantry.
“We also have established a phone train to reach out to our homebound parishioners who may not have computer access,” Kelly said.
Kelly added that the church is using social media to reach out to parishioners, the Choir School, and Catholic Harvard students who are now spread throughout the world.
The Society of Saint John the Evangelist — a monastery located near Harvard Square — announced on its website that while the chapel was closed for the foreseeable future, members of their communication team were working to find ways to stream or webcast services.
In an email to The Crimson, David Vryhof, a brother at SSJE, wrote that they plan to record the service of Compline — the final church service of the day — and several hymns for their website.
“We hope these will serve as a helpful resource for those who, along with us, are weathering the current health crisis,” he wrote.
SJJE Superior James Koester said the twelve brothers in the monastery will continue to celebrate the Eucharist, a Christian ceremony commemorating the Last Supper.
“We gather five times a day in the chapel,” he said. “We’re carrying on our liturgical life but without a congregation.”
Koester said part of SSJE’s Rule of Life states that the brothers offer their worship on behalf of the world.
“We’re aware right now that usually the world comes through our doors and we worship with the world,” he said. “But right now, the world can’t come in through our doors so we’re holding the world up in our prayers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — will continue to meet in accordance with its planned schedule, according to an email from the Corporation’s senior fellow William F. Lee ’72.
Last week, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that Harvard is moving instruction online due to the pandemic and asked students not to return to campus after spring break. Five Harvard affiliates have tested positive for the virus, according to the Harvard University Health Services website.
The United States had reported 10,442 COVID-19 cases and 150 deaths as of Thursday afternoon, with 256 cases in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Lee wrote that the Corporation will continue its meetings digitally.
“The Corporation will maintain its planned meeting schedule, but will use technology to allow us to comply with all of the guidance being provided regarding meetings,” Lee wrote. “In these unprecedented times, it is important that we continue to meet, even if remotely.”
The smaller of Harvard’s two governing bodies, the thirteen-member Harvard Corporation is the oldest corporation in the United States. The body also includes the University President, who sets the board’s agenda but does not vote at meetings.
The Corporation is charged with tasks ranging from setting Harvard’s budgets to selecting the deans of individual schools. Corporation members also help raise money for the University and serve as a sounding board when the President makes major decisions.
Lee added that he receives daily updates from Bacow.
“President Bacow has updated me on a daily basis on developments concerning the Harvard community and we have regularly updated the full Corporation,” he wrote.
Last week, administrators from Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study sent school-specific instructions after Bacow announced that Harvard would move to remote instruction beginning March 23. This announcement also stipulated that students not return to campus after spring break whenever possible.
Schools and administrative units across Harvard began a pilot of a remote work system for staff this week. Research at the Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Harvard School of Public Health, and Boston Children’s Hospital will be postponed — except for essential functions — between two weeks and two months.
School of Public Health School Dean Michelle A. Williams wrote in an email to the school’s affiliates that the novel coronavirus could pose one of the “biggest public health challenges we face in our lifetimes.”
COVID-19 has already infected more than 240,000 people and claimed almost 10,000 lives globally, according to a tally by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
Last Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency following a surge in confirmed cases nationwide and similar declarations by local and state governments. Some U.S. counties, including San Francisco County, have asked their residents to “shelter in place” and avoid going out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School students penned letters to Law School administrators Wednesday and Thursday asking them to implement a mandatory credit/no credit grading system following Harvard’s transition to remote learning as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 100 third-year students signed onto the Wednesday letter, while the First Class Law Students Association, joined by 30 student groups and 700 students, submitted the second on Thursday.
According to the letters, the Law School announced Mar. 16 that it would adopt a “credit/no credit optional” grading policy for the Spring 2020 semester. The letters acknowledge that this change aims to help students who face challenges studying off-campus.
“As a result of this health crisis, our most marginalized students are now navigating unstable or unsafe living conditions, food scarcity, and new familial obligations,” the Thursday letter reads.
But the letters argue that the ability to choose whether or not to continue using a letter grading system will disproportionately harm students whose living conditions force them to opt for credit/no credit grading.
“The policy rewards students not on the basis of merit, but rather on the basis of how much normalcy they will be able to maintain at this moment,” the Wednesday letter reads. “It serves to benefit those who are able to put their head down and treat this just as they would any other semester, something we know is not possible for many of our students, particularly low-income students, students of color, students who are parents, and others.”
The Wednesday letter also claims Law School advisors discouraged several students from opting for the credit/no credit option.
“Within hours of the policy change, its disparate impact became apparent,” it reads. “Students with the luxury of having time and capacity to immediately consult with school officials were discouraged from taking advantage of the new option.”
Law School student Juan Espinoza — the First Class Climate Director who helped draft the letter — said the opt-in system might reflect poorly on disadvantaged students when they are searching for employment.
“I think opting for credit/no credit versus a grading system does send a sign to whoever reads that transcript, especially if they know that they had the opportunity to either receive grades or not,” he said in a Thursday interview. “If this policy is to stay in place, the employers will know that some students have grades and some students do not have grades.”
The Thursday letter addressed this concern, claiming that opting for credit/no credit grading would be perceived as a sign of a lack of effort.
“Students who have readily relied on their tenacity and grit are asked to predict whether their acquired resilience will be enough to achieve desirable grades, or else calls upon them to combat a pervasive presumption that they ‘took the easy way out’ by electing to take their courses credit/no credit,” it reads.
Asked for comment on the letters, Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that administrators are currently reviewing input from many students who support or dislike the optional policy.
“We’ve received many thoughtful, detailed emails from students from a wide range of backgrounds, many of whom have advocated for an opt-in credit/fail approach and many of whom prefer a mandatory credit/fail approach,” he wrote. “We take all student input seriously and are carefully reviewing the information we’ve received.”
Both letters call for the Law School to establish a uniform credit/no credit option, which they claim would take the pressure off of disadvantaged students and make all transcripts equal in the eyes of employers.
“By implementing a mandatory credit/no credit system, not only will Harvard Law School affirm the value of its most vulnerable students to employers, it will also protect the students who are not yet aware of the hardships this crisis may bring,” the Thursday letter reads.
Espinoza reaffirmed that a mandatory grading policy would alleviate the concerns of the student organizations who penned the letter.
“It's an unfortunate situation and there will be harm regardless, but we believe this is the most fair policy for those who are most impacted by this crisis,” Espinoza said. “We believe that this protects those who are most vulnerable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Homeless shelters in Cambridge have begun to solicit donations and call for government intervention to support their guests as they struggle to confront the coronavirus crisis.
Harvard’s Phillip Brooks House Association, which operates two student-run shelters — the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y — launched a Homeless Shelter Emergency Fund to help cover unexpected costs due to the outbreak. Both shelters, which are normally operated by student volunteers, currently remain open despite uncertain futures.
“We’re all working really, really hard to see how we might be able to keep the space open for these populations because we know how critical it is,” PBHA Executive Director Maria J. Dominguez Gray said.
Dominguez Gray said the shelters have moved to operate “in a way that does not rely on our usual volunteer model.” In order to do so, HSHS and Y2Y have outsourced services including food and laundry.
She added that PBHA is considering having professional staff take over the day-to-day operations of its shelters, a move that would likely require ongoing fundraising.
Y2Y — which was founded in 2015 by Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 — has sent out fundraising emails along with PBHA in a bid to keep its doors open. In a Thursday email, Greenberg, Rosenkrantz and Y2Y Executive Director Cameron Van Fossen wrote it would be “catastrophic for our guests and the health of the community” if Y2Y closed due to the outbreak.
“We’ve had great support from alumni and other people who have stepped up,” Dominguez Gray said.
The First Church, which sits on Garden Street in Cambridge, is also working to keep the doors to its 14-bed shelter open despite staff shortages. Jim Stewart, the church’s shelter director, said First Church has begun collaborating with other area providers to encourage state and city officials to provide extra space to house homeless people amid the pandemic.
“It doesn’t make any public health sense to ask people to be sleeping essentially cheek to jowl in the midst of a public health crisis like this,” Stewart said. “It’s incumbent upon the state and the city to find additional spaces so that people who are poor and homeless can practice social distancing and not have to risk contracting a potentially life-threatening disease simply because they’re poor and homeless.”
“The governor and other public officials hector the citizenry to practice social distancing and stay home and work from home. But they seem quite content to tell homeless folks to stay in jam-packed human warehouses that have more in common with field hospices in a war zone than a public health facility,” he said.
Stewart added that the shelter’s guests often live with underlying conditions that render them vulnerable to the coronavirus.
“Many people who live on the street have underlying conditions that make it critical for us to try to find a way for them to stay safe and healthy. Otherwise, we’re going to have a public health disaster that impacts primarily the poor and people who live on the margins of society. That shouldn’t be the case,” Stewart said. “We should always be able to have a public health response for everybody in the community, not just those who have credit cards in their wallet.”
Against the backdrop of sparse coronavirus testing in the United States, numerous celebrities and elected officials — including several members of Congress and the Brooklyn Nets’ entire roster — have managed to get swabbed at medical facilities even without showing symptoms. Stewart said he finds disparities in testing “demoralizing.”
“From jump, it seems like those who have plenty and are able to take care of themselves always get to the front of the line, and those who have virtually nothing and most to lose are left just to fend for themselves,” Stewart said.
At the city level, Cambridge spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement that local officials are examining “a variety of creative strategies” to support homeless shelters and their guests.
“The City is in preliminary works to begin contracting with local restaurants to provide bag or boxed meals for lunch and for dinner to be delivered to the specified shelters and programs that have indicated a strong need for the meals,” Warnick wrote. “Additionally, the City is aggressively looking for alternative housing options for those who may have an illness or are not able to locate a bed in any open shelters, which currently includes the Warming Center in the City’s Senior Center.”
The office of Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 did not respond to a request for comment.
Kelly Turley, the associate director of the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, said the Coalition is encouraging the state to “be creative in finding alternative spaces” for homeless residents while many shelters are at capacity. She pointed to empty university campuses and military facilities as possible housing options.
Turley added that the Coalition for the Homeless is also pushing for a statewide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures to protect precariously housed residents “who may be at risk of experiencing homelessness because of unexpected and dramatic decreases in income.”
Dominguez Gray emphasized the importance of keeping the student-run shelters open during the crisis.
“The homeless population is particularly vulnerable,” she said. “We know that both for the wellbeing of the guests in our shelter, but also from a public health perspective about having people in the community who are more susceptible to infection, there’s a need to have the most safe beds possible for the homeless population.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students prepare for online instruction for the remainder of the semester in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arts concentrators are facing a number of challenges in completing their thesis projects and coursework.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey acknowledged these challenges in a letter sent to divisional faculty and staff on March 10. In the letter, he highlighted the need for new forms of instruction and evaluation of work.
“The core pedagogy in our Division involves face to face interaction, and some of our courses are grounded in resources — studios, art supplies, equipment, ensembles, galleries, etc. — to which students will lose access when they leave campus,” Kelsey wrote. “Those of us who were planning to evaluate students based on projects using Harvard equipment or supplies, will need to think creatively about other forms of engagement and assessment.”
Theater, Dance & Media concentrator Genevieve S. Lefevre ’20 found herself navigating uncharted territory when the planned production of her thesis play in Farkas Hall was halted. Lefevre wrote the show, called “In the Beginning,” and had planned to act in it as well.
Lefevre said her departmental advisors have provided support and increased flexibility in regard to the completion of her thesis.
“I’ve been in conversation with my advisors about the changes to the way my thesis will be evaluated, and the concentration is being really flexible with shifting the criteria around,” Lefevre said. “Some things will remain the same — for example, I will still turn in my script and a 20 page critical paper — but for assessing my work as an actor, we’re talking about writing monologues for myself and filming them.”
Lefevre noted that while the coronavirus outbreak has complicated the completion of her thesis, she is not completely disappointed in the prospects of her project.
“On a personal note, I’m not concerned about the grade I get for this project, because I didn’t do it for the grade or even for the honors distinction,” Lefevre said. “I chose to write a senior thesis, because this is a project that I care deeply about.”
“I have learned a lot from this process, and while it won’t be exactly what I imagined due to coronavirus, I will still hopefully be able to wrap up this experience in an artistically meaningful way,” she added.
In addition to impacting the completion of senior thesis projects, the COVID-19 outbreak has also affected instruction within the Theater, Dance & Media department, creating novel challenges for practical courses, such as acting and dance.
Julia H. Riew ’21, a Theater, Dance & Media and Music joint concentrator, said a highly-anticipated field trip in her class “The Making of a Musical: The Creative Process” to New York City had to be cancelled as a result of the outbreak, which led to disappointment for many of her classmates.
Lefevre underscored the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak, noting the lack of definitive plans for instruction in her acting classes.
“I think monologue work will be pretty straight-forward, but I am especially curious about how scene work with partners will function virtually,” Lefevre said. “Basically, I have no idea how this is going to work, and I think my professors are still figuring it out themselves.”
