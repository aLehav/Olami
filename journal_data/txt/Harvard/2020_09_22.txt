After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Readers of Rudyard Kipling’s “The Janeites,” a short story centered around a group of Jane Austen-reading WWI soldiers, will be entirely familiar with the link between Austen and distressing times. In real life, Austen’s novels were actually prescribed to WWI soldiers suffering from shell shock. While our present circumstances are in no way the same, we are all still dealing with a stressful, frustrating period in which we could use the comfort that her work provides. I suggest that this can come in the form of Ang Lee’s 1995 masterpiece “Sense and Sensibility,” which celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary this year. At the height of ’90s Austen-mania, Lee brought a compelling cast together to make one of the sweetest, most humorous adaptations of an Austen novel.
“Sense and Sensibility” remains a classic for many reasons, including its careful balance of creative liberties and authenticity. Like the 1811 novel of the same name, the film follows two sisters, the reserved Elinor (Emma Thomson) and romantic Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), after the death of their wealthy father. The two girls, a product of Mr. Dashwood’s second marriage, are prevented from inheriting their father’s estate because they are women. The inheritance instead passes entirely to their elder half-brother John (James Fleet). Egged on by his cruel wife Fanny (Harriet Walter), John does shockingly little to help his sisters financially, even removing them from their home. The girls and the rest of their family find their station in life changed considerable and any future romances compromised by their humble means.
Not only does Emma Thompson play Elinor Dashwood, but she also took on the challenge of writing the screenplay, for which she won an Academy Award. The result is still marvelous all these years later: she manages to boil down the novel to its essential elements. She succeeds in emphasizing the beloved characteristics of the humorous characters, in addition to bringing life to the novel’s most heartbreaking moments.
In Thompson’s hands, characters like the talkative Mrs. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) and the disgruntled Mr. Palmer (Hugh Laurie) take on a new kind of drollery. While in the novel we might spend most of the time laughing at Marianne’s melodrama, the script manages to turn the tables and make us laugh at Marianne’s wittiness instead. Thompson also gives voice to the frustrations women felt at this time regarding property laws and the marriage market. She channels these perfectly through Elinor’s speech to her suitor Edmund Ferrars (Hugh Grant) during one of their frequent horse rides, at once providing historical context for the viewer and giving constructive criticism on these injustices.
Of course, nothing exemplifies Thompson’s screenwriting skill more than Edmund’s proposal scene. After many separations and endless miscommunications, he and Elinor are finally reunited. Edmund’s proposal draws her to endless tears of happiness and relief, such that some of his impassioned speech is drowned out by her heaving sobs. The result is a curious but satisfying combination of hilarity and melancholy.
Much of the film’s pathos can be attributed to its excellent cast, from the leads all the way down to the most minor of characters. Winslet is a true delight. She lends Marianne just the right amount of romance and drama without being overbearing. Grant also depicts the rather awkward Edmund with charm. Although Elinor’s lover tends to lack charisma in the novel, the actor refreshes his character through Grant’s own signature stumbling sentences and dry irony.
Mrs. Dashwood’s character is translated marvelously on screen, with her high-strung nerves and carelessness caricatured through Gemma Jones’ excellent comedic timing. Alan Rickman is another gem as the tragic Colonel Brandon. Though the character can often feel opaque and mysterious, Rickman’s performance is warm and friendly such that Brandon becomes less alienating and more of an empathic character.
More praise is owed to Thompson who not only shines in her writing, but also in playing one of the leads. Thompson makes Elinor older than in the books, such that it is easier to understand her character’s level headedness and reserve. Thompson’s face is the perfect canvas for her emotions, registering these so well that it requires a mere crumple of her face to bring the audience to tears, like in the scene of Elinor’s confession to Marianne.
While newer, more experimental adaptations of Austen’s other novels are worth watching, it does not mean that we should let go of those that have paved the way, particularly this one. “Sense and Sensibility” marries a thoughtful director and a brilliant script that amplifies just how valuable it is for a film to nail the basics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this summer, Hulu released a stunning 12-part adaptation of Sally Rooney’s bestselling novel “Normal People,” which follows the lives of two Irish teenagers who keep coming back to each other despite shifting and often difficult circumstances. The show is a riveting, intimate portrait of first love, and it feels nearly impossible not to become totally invested in the relationship between Connell (Paul Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) by the time the final credits roll. Much of the series also takes place in social spaces — birthday parties, college societies, bustling city streets — that, in today’s climate of isolation, add a layer of melancholy even beyond the emotional tumult of the main romance. If you finished “Normal People” and were not fine, here are some shows that can help take your mind off of that uncertain ending, Connell’s chain, or the dreamy Italian sequences — minus the awful boyfriend, of course. If you haven’t watched “Normal People” yet, why are you still reading this? Go watch it.
If you want a great love story check out...
“Fleabag” Season 2 (Amazon Prime)
Okay, this one is obvious. If you haven’t watched “Fleabag, ” both seasons are poignant, brilliant, and hilarious — but the romance between Fleabag (the ever-charming goddess of all things, Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and the Hot Priest (Andrew Scott) in season two is one for the ages. This show also shares the BBC-style realism and color palette of "Normal People," features a great ensemble cast, and manages to be groundbreaking while still taking place in a messy, relatable world. The second season is perfect TV — don’t miss it.
“Outer Banks” (Netflix)
This sun-drenched adventure show is a fitting antidote to the epic emotional highs and lows of “Normal People.” The melodramatic trailer that auto-plays when you pull up Netflix sells “OBX” short — it’s a gorgeously shot, addictively fun grown-up version of “The Goonies.” Following a group of teenagers in North Carolina who go looking for a 17th century shipwreck filled with gold, the show is a love letter to the Outer Banks (where its creators grew up). It is also a moving portrait of adolescent friendship and romance that’s slightly more optimistic than “Normal People.” Animated by stunning scenery and fast action sequences, the show will cure your "Normal People" blues while stirring up warm memories of a time when you weren’t stuck inside.
“Friday Night Lights” (Amazon Prime)
On a surface level, “Friday Night Lights” is the opposite of “Normal People.” Five glorious, complicated seasons about a top-ranked high school football team in rural Texas don’t have much in common with 12 pared-down episodes about Irish teenagers going to college. But wait. “Friday Night Lights” shares “Normal People”’s engrossing, nuanced portrayal of relationships — platonic, romantic, familial — and pulls viewers in with multidimensional characters viewers can’t help but root for. While “Friday Night Lights” has plenty of cute romantic subplots, it ultimately revolves around the relationship between Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), whose charisma make the show a cult favorite. Plus, Taylor Kitsch’s Tim Riggins will fill the Connell-shaped void in your heart.
“Outlander” (Netflix)
Bear with me on this one. While it may be the “Riverdale” of historical dramas, “Outlander” is an absorbing distraction from the crushing realism of "Normal People." “Outlander” depicts the very steamy romance between Claire Randall (Caitriona Balfe), a woman living in 1940s England who accidentally time travels back to the 18th century (yep), and Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan), a sexy Scottish warrior she meets there. The show shares with "Normal People" an absolutely scorching love story, made better by Balfe and Heughan’s electric chemistry.
If you want a school/college nostalgia tour, then check out…
“Sex Education” (Netflix)
This show is a sweet, funny take on the John Hughes high school narrative, recalibrated for today’s world with complex, socially aware characters and great performances all around. “Sex Education” follows the exploits of Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield), an awkwardly loveable teenager who becomes the go-to source of sex advice at his high school in rural England. It might make you nostalgic for your friends, social events, and getting dressed up to go literally anywhere. It’s worth it.
“Euphoria” (HBOGo)
“Euphoria” is like if high school was one long, ambient, well-directed music video — intensely stylized and full of quick-moving parts. The result is haunting, beautiful, and obsessed with social dynamics: how people act in groups versus alone, how they change to fit in or make a statement, and how they rely on others. If you miss the friends, acquaintances, dining hall crushes, and even section kid enemies you encountered daily at school, “Euphoria” is a perfect distraction.
“Looking for Alaska” (Hulu)
This John Green adaptation is a woefully underrated dark horse on this list. After starting to watch it on a whim last month, I was drawn in by the relaxed, hilarious chemistry between its four leads — Miles (Charlie Plummer), the Colonel (Denny Love), Takumi (Jay Lee), and Alaska (Kristine Froseth) — whose friendships are the star of the show. As serious as it becomes, “Looking For Alaska” is also a funny, poignant, and occasionally magical portrayal of teenagers navigating life at a rural boarding school full of arrogant rich kids. “Looking For Alaska” impressively adapts Green’s YA novel into a more nuanced, mature narrative about real life problems. It’s definitely worth watching.
“The Society” (Netflix)
Yes, this show is insane. It’s more Stephen King than Sally Rooney. But look no further for another totally unique, thought-provoking examination of the transition from adolescence to adulthood. “The Society” centers around members of the graduating class from a small-town high school who return from their senior camping trip to find their town completely empty, all other residents having vanished without a trace. Realizing they’re stuck, they must establish a new society from scratch — which, as expected, poses many challenges. Though the show weaves together interpersonal drama (breakups, hookups, fights) and major philosophical quandaries (How can a group maintain law and order? Do we have a right to private property?), it never feels forced. “The Society” is completely one-of-a-kind and a great binge-watch.
If you want another show set in Ireland, check out… 
“Dublin Murders” (Amazon Prime)
Adapted from fellow maverick Irish author Tana French’s captivating mystery novels, “Dublin Murders” portrays two Irish detectives, Cassie Maddox (Sarah Greene, who you’ll recognize as Connell’s very cool mom in “Normal People”) and Rob Reilly (Killian Scott), as they try to solve two severely creepy murders in the Irish countryside. Though the adaptation slashes French’s complex, immersive plotlines in an attempt to fit them into one season, Greene and Scott give magnetic performances, and the show offers a fascinating glimpse into social dynamics in rural Ireland after the country’s economic crisis.
“Derry Girls” (Netflix)
This quirky comedy about four Irish girls (and one’s English cousin) navigating high school in Northern Ireland during the Troubles offers a unique portrayal of teenagers living through a complex historical moment while trying to figure out their own lives. With two seasons of tight, 20 minute episodes on Netflix and a third in the works, it’s perfect for a quarantine binge-watch.
If you want another great BBC drama, check out… 
“Killing Eve” (Hulu)
This acclaimed cat-and-mouse drama follows beleaguered MI6 agent Eve Polastri (the always-dynamic Sandra Oh) as she hunts down international assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer.) The two make obsessive, bloodthirsty enemies… or do they? As the show morphs into a bizarre, subversive romance, Eve chases Villanelle deeper and deeper into an international conspiracy. Though the second season loses some of the show’s original sleekness and suspense, “Killing Eve” remains one of the best crime shows on air right now, combining the classically grim, grey aesthetic of BBC dramas with opulent visuals from Villanelle’s international adventures.
“Catastrophe” (Amazon Prime)
This is not actually a BBC show, but it’s set in England and shares the visual palette and dry humor of a top-rate British comedy, so I’m including it here — sue me. “Catastrophe” could’ve just as well gone in the “love story” category, as it’s centered around the romantic relationship between American businessman Rob (Rob Delaney) and British school teacher Sharon (Sharon Horgan), who gets pregnant after the two meet in a bar. “Catastrophe” is hilariously funny, but it’s more than a great sitcom. It tells a moving, sometimes cringe-inducing love story that doesn’t gloss over the mundane, excruciating realities of life.
“Bodyguard” (Netflix)
This show was a huge hit on Netflix when it came out in 2018, and it’s perfect if you want to get lost in a gripping series about politics and class across the pond. Richard Madden is enigmatic and haunted as police sergeant David Budd, an Afghanistan veteran assigned to guard the scheming Home Secretary (Keeley Hawes.) “Bodyguard” has its fair share of secret trysts and interpersonal drama, but it’s fundamentally a razor-sharp, totally addictive crime series. Before you know it, you’ll forget all about Marianne and Connell and instead just be haunted by the way Richard Madden says “ma’am” like “mom.”
Hopefully, with the help of these recommendations, you’ll forget about the torturous question of whether Marianne and Connell end up together in no time. Happy watching!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With all the uncertainty in the world right now, hopelessness and apathy are inevitably seeping into everyday life. In response, an endless feed on TikTok has emerged that encourages us to reclaim the narrative and become the “main character” in the movie of our own lives. The songs on this playlist will help reframe any ordinary day into a scene fit for a protagonist in everything from an indie coming-of-age film to a blockbuster romantic drama.
1. “Electric Love” by Børns
Hop into a car and drive down a coastline; this song perfectly captures the feeling of infinite youth and an open heart. While the lyrics focus on the unparalleled shock of young love, “Electric Love” transcends its original message with the uplifting melody of an anthem fit for summer nights and long drives.
2. “I Hope You’re Happy” by Blue October
Is this a breakup song? Absolutely not. Blue October brings to this playlist a song of true empowerment and release, one that acknowledges the hardships of becoming an adult through heartbreak and struggle. Jeremy Furstenfeld, the hard-rocking drummer, shines through in this track, capturing the feeling of perseverance in growing up with his strong beat.
3. “Let Your Heart Hold Fast” by Fort Atlantic
Originally popularized by “How I Met Your Mother,” this song is the perfect cinematic soundtrack. Regardless of the hardship you may be enduring, be it a cancelled semester or a long-distance heartbreak, Fort Atlantic reminds listeners to “let your heart hold fast, for this soon shall pass,” words that resonate beyond generations.
4. “Someone To You” by BANNERS
In a period of unprecedented isolation, BANNER’s lyric “I just want to be somebody to someone” captures the strange feeling of aching to exchange love and life with no one in particular. BANNERS himself discussed the song’s longing in a Genius interview: “We’re all looking for a way to leave our mark really aren’t we?”
5. “Green Light” by Lorde
By her own admission, Lorde did not expect to produce this heartbreak song. However, the final product feels uniquely hers, imbued with the artist’s signature haunting lyrics and stunning vocals. The song pulses with a heartbeat, one that signifies action and anger rather than typical tragedy.
6. “Chicago” by Sufjan Stevens
Featured on the Netflix original “The Politician,” this song, and the album “Illinois" as a whole, feels deeply personal, drawing on singer Sufjan Stevens’ own experiences. More mellow than many of the rock songs on this playlist, “Chicago” travels through memories of mistakes and regrowth, self-doubt and discovery, perfect for a coming-of-age movie.
7. “Alaska” by Maggie Rogers
“Alaska” is yet another heartbreak song, but one that takes the focus completely away from the other person and the broken relationship, instead putting the spotlight on personal growth. The song chronicles Rogers’ journey through the wilderness of Alaska and awakens a desire of self-discovery and freedom for her listeners. Her lyrics say it all: “Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth / Without thinking of you.”
8. “A Letter to My Younger Self” (feat. Logic) by Quinn XCII
Who wouldn’t want the chance to fix the mistakes of their youth or to tell their younger selves to appreciate what they’ve now lost? Quinn XCII explains the desire to go back and comfort his younger self, who was wrapped up in meaningless stress and insecurity. In the chorus, he pleads, “I hope this helps.” Like many songs in this playlist, it encourages individuality, but deviates by focusing on retrospection rather than the present moment.
9. “Beige” by Yoke Lore
Although slower paced than other entries on this playlist, “Beige” is a love song with a synth-filled instrumental that feels like standing on the edge of a mountain. Heavy and breathtaking in its vocals, Yoke Lore’s song takes the spontaneity and emotional vulnerability of love and transforms it into a feeling of invincibility and readiness to take on the world.
10. “Crash My Car” by COIN
The title and chorus are perfect: “I love the way you're breaking my heart.” In an age of constant distraction and details, people seldom surrender to a singular, overwhelming feeling. But it’s easy on the big screen, and COIN’s song feels like the rare instance of succumbing to desire without fear of consequences.
11. “Traveling Song” by Ryn Weaver
A tribute to Ryn Weaver’s grandfather and his adventurous spirit, “Traveling Song” is stripped down and vulnerable. The song is exactly what the title suggests: a testament to the journey through childhood, through life, and through loss. Ending with an acapella speech, the song peels back the layers to a single life lived with joy. Much like the cathartic end to an epic cinematic journey, this examination of stories left behind is a fitting end to this playlist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first chapter of Celia Laskey’s “Under the Rainbow,” a lesbian named Tegan, wearing a jacket that says “vulva,” says that when LGBTQ+ people are in charge, “we’ll all stand by doing nothing as [straight people] get beat up and raped and murdered all because of who they fuck.” A few paragraphs later, gay man David says, “teenage girls in small towns are even cattier than gay men” before walking away to put Mariah Carey on the stereo.
“Under the Rainbow,” Laskey’s debut novel, follows an activist circle that volunteers to spend two years in Big Burr, Kansas, a fictional place rated as the most homophobic town in the US. Each chapter is written in the perspective of a different individual who is impacted by the group’s presence in some way — a lonely elderly woman who befriends one of the activists, a married man uncovering his sexuality, or a woman questioning whether she wants children — and spans the course of the group’s two-year stay in the town.
Laskey herself is a lesbian, and she describes the book on Twitter as her “gay child.” While Laskey’s attempt at a reckoning with homophobia is certainly admirable, the book itself ultimately comes across as simplistic, vague, and lacking in serious critical thought. In some ways, the novel is reminiscent of hit TV series “Glee” or a badly scripted after-school special: It tries to take on a variety of serious issues without the ability to level serious social critique, instead landing the piece firmly in the domain of the moralistic and cheesy.
The flat, archetypal characters are one of the novel’s most egregious flaws. The cast largely consists of undeveloped people who lack dimensionality and personability. The novel also perpetuates a number of troubling tropes, such as a daughter who feels shamed for her heterosexuality by her lesbian mother and a middle-aged gay couple who can only have sex with a third party present. It also follows a recent trend of cisgender characters acknowledging a nonbinary character’s gender only after they are unable to categorize them as either male or female. This trend fosters a depiction of non-binary identity where individuals are required to “pass” perfectly in order to ease cisgender characters into the recognition of nonbinary identity.
Certainly, there are indeed people who conform to these stereotypes: there are gay men who love Mariah Carey, lesbians who wear vulva jackets, polyamorous gay couples, and bored housewives who commit minor arson. But why, one has to wonder, are these the only people who seem to populate Big Burr in Laskey’s novel?
There is also a legitimate place for queer rage in the novel. But why is it tossed aside as a threat, as a joke, as an act of violence on par with legitimate homophobia?
If these character templates are meant as in-jokes for the LGBTQ+ community, the humor fails to come across. Beyond that, it seems clear that the book is at least partially designed with cisgender, heterosexual audiences in mind: Even within the text, LGBTQ+ characters often function exclusively as a way to teach straight people about homophobia, themselves lacking authentic individual development. Laskey portrays the majority of gay people as catty, narcissistic urbanites with a savior complex who hate (or at least condescend to) heterosexuals.
Meanwhile, the book’s writing itself is stilted and heavy handed, marked by its rigid, predictable prose. Laskey’s use of exposition is sloppy and obvious, while the plot development lacks both form and motion. Additionally, while the use of multiple perspectives helps showcase a variety of voices, it also results in a lot of sudden turn-arounds, loose ends, and inconsistent character development, undermining the book’s narrative shape.
In addition to the simplistic depiction of LGBTQ+ characters, Laskey’s portrait of small-town, rural life reads more as condescension than serious analysis. Laskey, who grew up in a college town near Portland, Maine, creates a patronizing image of middle America disconnected with the reality of rural life. The book seems to reduce homophobia to a rural/urban divide, feeding into narratives of wealthy and urban gays versus poor and rural heterosexuals that are functionally divisive and simplistic, perpetuating hateful rhetoric.
The book also fails to account for the question of whiteness in any real way, besides a few quips that come off as awkward and out-of-place. This absence is hard to justify when talking about conservatism in rural America. There are clearly attempts at inclusion and acknowledging race, but they remain on the individual level, such as references to cultural food or references to racism which primarily serve to educate and relate to white characters.
In general, characters of color are treated as tokens that exist largely for the development of their white counterparts. Homophobia, too, is dealt with on a relatively simplistic scale: The novel presents a world where homophobia would be solved, at least partially, if every farmer were forced to get a cup of coffee with a gay person, neglecting the reality of systemic, violent homophobia.
“Under the Rainbow” is not nonfiction, nor is it academic analysis, and it should not be asked to do that work. At the same time, its reductive approach to serious, nuanced questions of contemporary homophobia and racism undercut any legitimate work it attempts. Beyond that, the prose and narrative form are themselves weak and inconsistent, leaving it absent of complex critique or personally compelling story, while the characters remain flat and difficult to root for.
One has the sense that “Under the Rainbow” is designed as a boundary crossing, unifying force that transcends homophobia. Unfortunately, the execution is lacking: The novel leaves its audience with a read that ultimately comes across as didactic and unexciting, with relatively little to offer the growing canon of contemporary LGBTQ+ literature.

To undergo emotional trauma, feel that trauma in one’s limbs, and then translate how that body feels in the wake of extreme grief and loss is a multi-step process, one that might well be described as “agonizing” — and yet Rachel Eliza Griffths has translated this trauma, beautifully, in “Seeing the Body.”
The loss of her mother, Michele Antoinette Pray-Griffths, anchors the collection thematically, permeating even seemingly unrelated poems within the collection. Despite the visceral pain, present in each and every line of each and every poem, Griffiths’ poems are filled with color and all its manifestations: gold in “Volume” and “Arch of Hysteria, Or, The Spider-Mother Becomes a Woman”; dripping honey, red, blood, and blue. The result is a lyrical yet forceful communication of pain that resonates across the senses. We can see it, hear it, feel it, and taste it.
The slim volume is bisected by a series of photographs — some overexposed, some exquisitely immersed in shadow — that reveal the extent of grief’s ability to both contort and guide the body. In one blurry image, all we see is the curve of Griffths’ spine. In another, her body unfolds, and all we see are her legs sticking out from behind a sofa, almost at rest. The final issue in the series depicts Griffiths approaching a tree with a few flowers in bloom, set against a sky that, even though the images are all in black and white, shows signs of developing into a thundercloud. Griffiths describes herself in the series as “a woman whose spirit is both emaciated and exhilarated in the face of monumental loss.”
All her poems are towering achievements, yet even from among them, a few stand out. Griffith's multifaceted experience of being a Black woman in the 21st century is integral to the collection. “Signs” clearly encapsulates the physical translation of grief: “My hair fell out. / Kinky questions black on my pillow, I wore wigs. / My doctor spoke of mutiny, of my eggs, the starless issue / of impossible children.” “My Rapes” is about just that, while also giving voice to how she didn’t speak of it and was told not to, encouraging future women who should write about their experiences.
This poem, delivered through long lines rendering it almost paragraph-like to the eye, will make you want to read rapidly, all the while forcing you to stop and wade through at a slow pace. It is impossible to not take in every word: “This terrible poem is for us, / we outlaw women who have taken off the silence / of our muzzles & armed our bones with stars, / we who leap from the attics we are burning down.”
Griffths skewers American culture and America’s endemic anti-Blackness. “Color Theory & Praxis I” critiques a white woman co-opting the death of Emmett Till in the name of artistic “expression”: “Imagine what it would take / to paint millions of broken black bones that way? / Dare she think she owns us too: the still-life my people / are still dying for?”
“Good America, Good Acts” quotes the famous line from the film “A Time to Kill” — “Now imagine she’s white” — and asks the reader to do the opposite of that: Think about what it means to be Black in America today, how “America has never surrendered / exposing its lust for blood.” The reader is complicit, too: “You aren’t doing anything anymore. / You’ve never done anything. Not you, not your country. / Everything that happened was long ago.”
And “Good Mother,” an ode to the woman who embraced Griffths in Rite Aid when she realized that Mother’s Day was imminent, so soon after her mother’s death, is not nearly as abstracted as her other poems, but viscerality courses through it and off the page. The book itself feels alive — a sentiment confirmed after reading even the very first line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the title “Godshot” and the premise of a small town consumed by a cult may create an expectation that the novel centers on religious themes, a story about mothers and daughters lies at the heart of the book. The novel manages to operate at a high level when exploring its central themes of motherhood and female empowerment, but it falls flat in addressing the other big questions it raises.
Chelsea Bieker’s “Godshot: A Novel” presents the women of Peaches, California, a small town that was once famous for producing raisins but has been impoverished by years of drought. The town has been taken over by the Gifts of the Spirit Church, a cult run by Pastor Vern, a man who claims to embody God to give “assignments” to all believers. Fourteen-year-old Lacey May is a believer eager to receive her assignment until her mother is suddenly banished from the church and leaves town with a man. Lacey’s faith is shaken by the loss of her mother, and she goes on a journey to find her and eventually escape from the increasingly traumatic demands of the church.
The novel features women empowering themselves and navigating all facets of motherhood and “mother-loss.” A young woman grieves the loss of her mother while becoming a mother herself, against a backdrop of mothers and daughters trying to love and protect one another with varying degrees of success. Lacey’s arc of grappling with both the love she feels for her mother and her anger and confusion at being abandoned and ultimately letting her go is executed with an impressive degree of nuance. The other women who are part of her journey — like Daisy and Florin, the mother and daughter duo who run a local phone sex business where Lacey’s mother worked — are also fairly complex, with growth and desires of their own.
Bieker bites off more than she can chew by trying to balance these themes with the questions about faith and religion central to the premise. As a result, the narrative of the cult is ultimately underdeveloped. Lacey starts off the novel as a devoted follower, and Bieker humanizes the cult’s victims by justifying their firm belief. At one point as Lacey’s faith is fading, she finds a vine of grapes growing perfectly in Vern’s garden even as the drought has killed every other crop in town, and she thinks, “I understood… then, how you could witness a miracle and how it could change the way you saw everything forevermore.”
Yet Bieker does not offer Lacey or any other character’s religious journey real complexity. Once Lacey’s mother is banished and she is abused by the church, Lacey seems to immediately see Vern’s manipulation for what it is. This turn makes it seem like shaking off a lifetime of indoctrination just requires growing up and opening one’s eyes, oversimplifying what the healing process is actually like for victims of abuse. Eventually the protagonist comes to realize she actually believes in a kind and loving God as opposed to Vern’s punishing version of God, but the reader doesn’t get to see how she arrives at this understanding. The resolution of the cult is rather rushed and dissatisfying once it is no longer central to Lacey’s development.
“Godshot” is written with consistent and competent execution, but it doesn’t grab the reader’s attention. The novel deals with significant amounts of trauma, including repeated instances of rape and pedophilia, abandonment, domestic abuse, cult indoctrination. Much of the novel is the process of a young girl surviving and processing these traumas in a dying town, leaving almost no room for brightness.
Even as Lacey has small victories or breakthroughs, the bulk of the novel is bereft of joy, which can make it a struggle to get through at points. There are few real surprises in the plot and character development; it seems that every major event could have been anticipated a few chapters before it happened. The novel isn’t poorly written, but it also doesn’t leave readers on the edge of their seats. This predictability and persistent tragedy also makes it difficult to fully emotionally connect with the characters. “Godshot” tells a complex yet hopeful story of suffering, growth, and womanhood, but it doesn’t quite offer anything new enough to keep the reader engaged.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, “Star Wars” emerged as a consensus escapist favorite, blowing up box office receipts with unprecedented fervor, burgeoning into a stalwart staple of American pop culture, and somehow keeping George Lucas culturally relevant for over 40 years (despite his not having directed a film since 2005).
Since 1977, however, “Star Wars” has evolved into a divisive property. The prequels are infamous for their wooden approximations of human dialogue, and the sequels — while launching on a promising note with director J.J. Abrams’ “The Force Awakens” — managed to displease many fans. Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” subverted too many expectations and Abrams’ conclusion “The Rise of Skywalker” subverted none.
The “Star Wars” franchise needs a savior — and it may have found it with “The Mandalorian.” After all, what can be a more unifying force than Baby Yoda?
Showrunner Jon Favreau (director of “Iron Man” and “The Jungle Book”) helms a series that pays tribute to the adventure serials that inspired George Lucas’ original film. Armed with a talented crew of directors, worthy themes, a refreshing score from Ludwig Göransson, and a new generation of cutting edge visual effects, Favreau’s series sends Star Wars to breathtaking new heights in (thankfully) unexplored territory.
“The Mandalorian” follows a lone, ruthless Mandalorian gunslinger (Pedro Pascal) who scours the galaxy claiming bounties and freezing them in carbonite. The series unfolds when the Mandalorian is tasked to capture an indomitable target, one that turns out to be “The Child” — lovingly and non-canonically dubbed by fans as "Baby Yoda". Favreau explores the unlikely relationship forged between such diametrically opposed characters — one a hardened killer, the other an innocent child.
The series delves quite naturally into more complicated themes. A central motif of “The Mandalorian” is morality. The titular Mandalorian character (unnamed and unmasked until the series' end) is bound by a strict honor code; he is confronted by a series of decisions between honoring that code, fending for his own interests, and eventually, fending for others'. In doing so, Favreau banks on some of the oldest Hollywood tropes, evoking themes of individualism from the western and the samurai genres that came before it (specifically a series of six films called “Lone Wolf and Cub”). "The Mandalorian" also questions what it means to belong to a group — Is one simply born with innate characteristics? Or can one still choose a path for themselves?
Granted, many story beats are predictable, and some episodes take a long pause from the overarching story. Episodes four and five in particular seem to act as filler episodes, and because they feel so tangentially removed from the main line, it's difficult to get emotionally involved in their stakes.
What keeps this series cohesive is the creative talent working behind the camera. Favreau deploys a talented group of directors, including Academy Award-nominated director Taika Waititi (“Jojo Rabbit,” “Thor: Ragnarok”) and Dave Filoni (show-runner for “Star Wars: The Clone Wars”) as well as relative newcomers Rick Famuyiwa (who directed the most tense, claustrophobic entry in Episode 6), actor Bryce Dallas-Howard (who made a rare directorial venture), and Deborah Chow (the sole director for Disney+’s upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi series). Each director imbues their episode(s) with signature traits — for instance, Waititi's episode is marked by a touch more humor, such as the comical bickering between stormtroopers. But overall, "The Mandalorian'' maintains its tonal consistency as a gritty Space-Western — likely thanks to Favreau writing 6 of the 8 episodes.
Another standout is the score, written by Academy Award winning composer Ludwig Göransson (“Black Panther” and “Creed”). The titular theme highlights Göransson's strengths in layering musical textures; contrary to John Williams’ iconic Star Wars themes which resonated with a vibrant orchestral melody, Göransson is happy to go off the beaten path, emphasizing an eclectic mix of woodwind, a heavy rhythm on drums, and a melody on an electric guitar. Just as Göransson synthesized cultural roots (with choirs and talking drums) and modern techniques in his “Black Panther” score, he finds himself at his best crafting a unique science fiction score here.
George Lucas once criticized Disney’s sequel trilogy for not innovating in the realm of film production technology. The original “Star Wars” trilogy redefined attention to visual effects, and the prequels helped pioneer the digital age of cinema. Disney’s sequel trilogy films, as well-budgeted as they were, offered nothing new. Favreau sought to revert that trend in "The Mandalorian" with groundbreaking visual effects technology.
As a science fiction series with predictably other-worldly settings, production on “The Mandalorian” was understandably burdened by effects-heavy production. However, “The Mandalorian” didn’t resort to using green screen; instead, Favreau employed ‘virtual sets’ — a 180 degree, top to bottom sea of LED screens that surround the set while filming. Instead of a blank green canvas where visual effects artists render effects after filming, set backgrounds were often pre-rendered and projected behind and around the set. Actors could better react to their surroundings, and lighting adjustments in post-production were largely eliminated. Theoretically, a virtual set would prove burdensome to a dynamic camera — if the background doesn't move with the camera, it would be an obvious faux backdrop and the audience would be taken out of the illusion. But the virtual set accounts for parallax, adjusting the angle and view of the rendered background in real time and in sync with camera movements.
It’s not all new: “The Mandalorian” keeps the same production principles that made the original “Star Wars” films larger-than-life fantasies. For instance, many alien characters are brought to life by prosthetics rather than computer graphics, and Baby Yoda is a painstakingly detailed animatronic, controlled by a team of 50 puppeteers.
In many ways, “The Mandalorian” is exactly what Star Wars fans wanted: a standalone world set in a time period rarely explored. While it doesn't provide an original story by any means, the darker tone, resonant score, and industry-changing special effects have elevated Favreau's series to fan favorite status, even earning it a Primetime Emmy Awards nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Series.
Season One of “The Mandalorian” is currently streaming on Disney+ and Season Two is set to premiere on October 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During their storied presence in the alt-rock scene, Oklahoma-based rock group The Flaming Lips wove their melodies into entire universes inhabited by Martians and hostile pink robots. After decades of taking audiences on such far-flung sonic journeys, the band finally feels at home on Earth in their latest release. Their 16th studio album, “American Head,” confronts the complex legacy of their past with openness and warmth.
The first track, “Will You Return / When You Come Down,” greets listeners with a layered chord that carries a reverential expansiveness — until it abruptly cuts off after two seconds, to be replaced with a pointed and more inward-looking synth motif. The incisive simplicity of the lyrics, set in relief against a dreamlike backing track, lends the song its strength. Lead singer Wayne Coyne asks the titular question four times before painting the chilling image of “ghosts / Floating around your bed.” In an interview with Apple Music, Coyne named the ghosts as old friends who died before their time, dismantling his idealistic visions of seeing them in another life. “And all of these are just fantasies, so you really have to face the horrible truth that you’re never going to see that person again,” he said.
Country-pop trailblazer Kacey Musgraves makes several appearances on the album, including in the wordless, warbling melody of “Watching the Lightbugs Glow.” As Musgraves sings over a leisurely beat, mellow instrumentals rise and fall with her improvised vocals. Inspired by her memories of playing music for a firefly she had found on a leaf, the track further helps establish the album’s nostalgic mood
Many of the remaining eleven songs drift along with the same airy melancholy. With its celestial imagery and searching backdrop, “Flowers of Neptune 6” showcases the album’s characteristic instrumentation — a careful blend of synths and acoustics — at its best. Coyne describes the “powerful and personal” track as a more reflective companion to “Watching the Lightbugs Glow,” as well as a meditation on how music facilitates emotional sincerity. “You’d just be too embarrassed,” he said of expressing certain feelings in conversation. “But music wants you to go all the way.”
The similarly wistful “Dinosaurs on the Mountain” calls to mind the lull of a music box, which ties in beautifully with the song’s theme of childhood imagination. “I wish the dinosaurs were still here now / It’d be fun to see them playing on the mountains,” Coyne sings in the first verse. Like many of the album’s tracks, its lyrical precision evokes a universal longing for youth.
“Mother Please Don’t Be Sad” recounts Coyne’s thoughts during a robbery that occurred at his workplace. “I won’t see you tonight,” he thinks to his mother, his own devastation evident in the lyrics’ striking immediacy. The seamless transition into the next track, the aggressively uptempo “When We Die When We’re High,” is perhaps the album’s most memorable moment. The casually buoyant final track, “My Religion Is You,” also highlights Coyne’s close relationship with his mother. “It still feels like a folk song or religious song or something, but nothing in our life — my life, anyway — was ever so heavy that I had to turn to God,” Coyne said. “I always had my mother.” The chorus reinforces the strength of these feelings: “Nothing else is true / My religion is you.”
Despite the album’s heartfelt and often anecdotal lyrics, its preoccupation with creating a cohesive sound can, at times, place limits on its potential. That said, the floating instrumentals of “American Head” still succeed in conjuring the growing emotional distance between past and present. With their wisdom and perspective, The Flaming Lips do away with seeking inspiration in other worlds: They’ve shown that Earth is full of untold stories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s fitting that amid a pandemic, we turn to music that reflects our isolation. Rather than turn to saccharine, synth-heavy tracks about nights out on the town, we’re drawn to songs that look inwards. For example, it’s no surprise that the arguable album of the summer is Taylor Swift’s stripped-down release, “Folklore.” After all, it stayed at the top of the Billboard 100 for the first five weeks after its release.
“BREACH,” indie artist Fenne Lily’s latest album after her 2018 self-released debut, “On Hold,” is exactly that type of album. It is the kind that only seems more compelling when the rest of the world is quiet.
At its core, “BREACH” is an album about being alone. It’s also an album overflowing with the catharsis that comes from the acceptance of that loneliness, spurred on by Lily’s own striking self-awareness.
Starting her career with the occasional gig in her hometown of Bristol, England, the folk singer-songwriter has since found a home in the American indie music scene after signing with indie record label Dead Oceans — the same label as indie icon Phoebe Bridgers — in March. She released her sophomore album, “BREACH,” on Sept. 18.
The album follows Lily over a period of mourning for love found, lost, and often found again, both for herself and for past significant others. Often, the lyrical representation of these lost feelings of love in the album is raw to the point of sounding spiteful. At other points, the album’s relentless vulnerability means that she sings of her own shortfalls instead. Lily’s soft and heavenly vocals mediate the space between the two.
“We talked about getting married / And now I hate your guts but I can't shut up,” Lily sings on “Birthday,” her voice floating above an ethereal string section as she criticizes the pitfalls of a relationship in which she gave too much. “Bleeding on a foreign floor / Slow dying / And it's not hard to be alone anymore,” she sings on another track, “Berlin,” about learning to stand being alone with her thoughts in the heart of the German city.
In an album full of glittering electric guitar harmonies, “Solipsism” takes on a grungier sound. From the track’s onset, fuzzy electric guitars and crashing snare hits dominate the song, powering away under Lily’s crystalline vocals. “What is it you want to shake? / Solipsism keeps me wide awake,” she sings, her voice heavy with the anxiety of knowing her own existence is the only one she can be sure of. “Focus on a foreign feeling / Unashamed and unappealing,” she sings in another verse. Lily spends much of the track focusing on this feeling of dissociation, just as the song’s heavy instrumentation evokes dissonance against the rest of the album’s vibrant musicality.
After an album full of candid apologies, of shared regrets and open wounds, “Solipsism” feels like a step forward and away from the demons of Lily’s past. The track represents Lily’s path toward final acceptance of what can and cannot be known.
By the album’s end, Lily shifts from singing of past relationships and bridges burned — as seen in “Birthday” and “I, Nietzche” — to singing of her relationship with herself. Though that shift starts with “Solipsism,” it is most evident in the album’s closing tracks, such as “Someone Else’s Trees.”
In “Someone Else’s Trees,” a song about almost dying at five years old, Lily sings about how she sometimes wishes she had. “I'm not afraid to die more so to be alive,” she sings while a light acoustic guitar pushes her voice forward. “I know in this and more I'm not alone.” In those two lines, Lily encapsulates the undercurrent of despair that lurks under much of the album, but also the growth that has taken place in her to recognize those feelings for what they are.
While the first half of the album helps to hide these thoughts under the glitz of a bright melody and shimmering indie production, the closing tracks shift to a new kind of rawness. Both built upon an acoustic guitar, they provide the perfect come down from the whirlwind of emotions that “BREACH” evokes.
In “BREACH,” Lily makes artful use of her ability to play on her listener’s empathies, creating an album that invites a deeply cathartic response to Lily’s loneliness from start to finish. Whether she’s singing about an “arsehole” she dated or her own struggles with isolation and identity, her unapologetically honest lyrics bring her listeners right there with her.
After the success of her debut album in indie music circles, Lily’s follow-up in “BREACH” serves as a testament to her ability to skillfully weave emotion, lyricism, and musicality into a glowing tapestry, further cementing the singer-songwriter’s rightful place in the indie canon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indie music is often seen as the soundtrack for young people. It’s touted as a space open to women and filled with “male feminists” — a place for forward-thinkers unbothered by what’s mainstream. Unfortunately, open-mindedness isn’t an antidote to toxic masculinity, and consequently, to sexual abuse.
Despite any shallow attempts to appear otherwise, the general indie music scene has always been a male-dominated space, and a mostly white and heteronormative one as well. From its inception as an evolution of 1970s punk rock, indie and alternative music represented an alternative avenue for men to play music without the worry of conforming to the “mainstream,” a space where fuzzy guitars and infectious riffs reigned supreme. Though the concept of indie brought with it a certain brand of freedom to experiment and exist away from the typical constraints of popular music, that freedom was only allotted to certain groups. Women, and most marginalized groups for that matter, were hardly allowed into indie spaces. When they were, it was rarely with the same freedom enjoyed by its white male proponents.
In the ‘90s, at the beginnings of the modern-day indie scene, movements like The Riot Grrrls dedicated themselves to fighting against the male-dominated aspect of indie and punk scenes and creating safe spaces for women at their shows. After experiencing sexual assault themselves, at shows and elsewhere, they encouraged all-girl moshpits, warned other women in their scene about dangerous or predatory musicians, and actively supported survivors of sexual assault. Still, the same problems that they faced then continue to plague female artists and fans 30 years later. Women in music, women like Clementine Creevy of Cherry Glazerr and Lydia Night of the Regrettes, continue to face a culture rife with sexual misconduct and abuse.
Creevy, like many women in the indie scene, alleges that she experienced abuse when she was much younger than her abuser, according to a now-deleted statement on July 15 quoted in Brooklyn Vegan. As the statement alleges, the abuse began when she was a 14 year old girl in high school and Sean Redman, the recently-dropped bassist for post-punk band The Buttertones, was 20. "Sean treated me badly,” she alleged in the Instagram statement. “He was emotionally volatile and selfish. He was also very threatened by my feminism and feminism in general, and he also gave me gonorrhea because he never used protection when he cheated on me. He is a narcissist and a predator.” She continued: “Countless women I know have had experiences like mine with male musicians and it is heartbreaking and infuriating that young girls wanting to play music or see music should ever have to endure being sexualized by older male musicians in the scene - it is disgusting and it needs to end now."
Indeed, both following and prior to Creevy’s statements, other women have come forward with accounts of alleged abuse by Redman’s bandmates that they experienced when they were teenage girls. Chloe Razink, for example, posted on Instagram before Creevy did to recount her own alleged experience being groomed over text and made uncomfortable in a sexual encounter with Redman. Another woman whose band would play with The Buttertones detailed her alleged sexual misconduct from lead singer Richard Araiza in an Instagram post. “So many men in bands are predatory to young women and it’s disgusting,” she wrote, “Do not support The Buttertones. I am so sorry for their victims of assault and I hope that these men learn from their mistakes and can get help to better themselves and stop this predatory behavior.”
The Buttertones did not respond to a request for comment.
Night, like Creevy, was much younger when she allegedly experienced abuse from Joey Armstrong of punk-rock band SWMRS. When she was 16 and he was 22, she reported that she began a relationship with Armstrong after he reached out to her to offer the Regrettes a spot on SWMRS’ upcoming tours. In her Instagram post on July 22, Night described that it quickly became a relationship which she now describes as toxic and built on “emotional abuse and sexual coercion by someone in a position of power.” Because Night was a minor throughout the entire time she says they were together, she reports that Armstrong would encourage her to keep their relationship secret, which often meant that the power he had over her, as both an older man and a member of a successful band, could go unchecked. “This created an isolated mindset where I felt alone,” she wrote, continuing to describe how after their relationship ended “it felt like SWMRS and their team were doing anything they could to exert power and punish [her]” when SWMRS and the Regrettes were on tour together.
“I respect her immensely and fully accept that I failed her as a partner. I was selfish and I didn’t treat her the way she deserves to have been treated both during our relationship and in the two years since we broke up,” Armstrong said in an Instagram statement addressing Night’s allegations. “I have apologized to her privately and I hope she can forgive me, if and when she is ready to do so. I own my mistakes and will work hard to regain the trust that I lost.”
Both SWMRS and The Buttertones were previously associated with Burger Records, an independent DIY record label from Fullerton, California known for its cassette releases and live shows. The now-defunct label has recently come under fire due to sexual assault allegations against its staff and several of its bands, including SWMRS, The Buttertones, The Frights, The Growlers, and Cosmonauts.
“I’m a Burger predator!” reads a redesigned Burger Records logo in the first post on @lured_by_burger_records, an Instagram account dedicated to “amplifying voices and supporting victims of sexual predation by those involved with Burger Records.” First created on July 18, the Instagram account has grown to amass over 37,700 followers. Its posts feature multiple stories from women who describe alleged abuse from Burger Records staff and the artists they represented, many of them women and young girls who were allegedly groomed, harassed, and lured into unsafe spaces during tours, festivals, and in-store performances. As detailed by the account, it was common to see young girls invited to back rooms or vans to drink and take drugs with men who were much older, sometimes almost twice their age. “The people at Burger Records created a cesspool of trauma by allowing these men [in the Burger music scene] to prey on children…. Burger Records was catering to these young and vulnerable people en masse, taking their money, and allowing them to be lured in by predators,” reads a post on the account.
Following these allegations, Burger attempted to rebrand itself as BRGR RECS and released a plan for moving forward, including the creation of an all-women imprint named BRGRRR. They also planned a fund to support treatment for women suffering from trauma as a result of the abuse they faced within the Burger scene, and stated that they would designate ‘safe spaces’ for women at upcoming shows and festivals. The president and co-founder of the label, Lee Rickard, also stepped down from his post.
Sean Bohrman, co-founder of Burger Records, did not respond to a request for comment.
While these are all moves in the right direction, it is not enough. A label so steeped in sexual abuse and misogyny, known for representing numerous bands with credible accusations of sexual assault cannot simply take out some vowels in its name and move on. It is not enough to jump to hypothesized plans and “safe spaces” without first fully publicly acknowledging the hurt and trauma caused directly by the label and its affiliates.
Surrounding the release of their plan, Burger Records turned off the comments on their Instagram where survivors were coming forward with stories of abuse before deleting their Instagram account altogether, thus silencing the survivor’s voices. For this and their planned moves towards a purported accountability, Burger received sharp criticism on social media. Once the label’s new interim president, Jessa Zapor-Gray, decided to step down, Burger Records shut down completely and is in the process of removing their music from streaming platforms.
The issue of sexual abuse, predation, and a general abuse of power in indie music, however, does not start or end with Burger Records. In the ‘90s, the Riot Grrrls focused much of their careers protesting these very same structures, yet the problems persist. In 2017, with the wake of the #MeToo movement, indie music scenes were again held up to the microscope. Musicians with allegations against them, like solo artist Alex Calder and guitarist Matt Mondanile of indie band Real Estate, were dropped from their bands and labels. Even following the whirlwind of Burger allegations, new stories have emerged. On July 30, indie label Subpop dropped alternative artist Avi Buffalo following accusations of rape and emotional abuse by fellow artist and collaborator Rebecca Coleman of the band Pageants. And still, how many more unheard stories are there?
No matter how “woke” or welcoming indie music may want to seem, it is not free of the same power structures and culture of toxicity that occur in more mainstream scenes. To pretend otherwise and turn a blind eye to the history of abuses in spaces like the Burger scene is to become complicit within these structures, and to perpetuate the abuses that stem from them. As journalist and former DJ Liz Ohanesian says of the indie music scene, “This is the world where guys rule. Indie rock is the one place where you can have male Sleater-Kinney fans mansplain to you.” Despite the surface-level “wokeness” of men who listen to all-women bands like Sleater-Kinney, however, the performative liberalism in these spaces only serves to mask the fact that the indie genre has historically been and still is male-dominated, thus warranting the same degree of reckoning and accountability as any other male-dominated space.
Dropping abusers from labels marks a step in the right direction, but it is not nearly enough to count as true accountability or justice for survivors. This is particularly true when abusers are so often able to resume their careers after short hiatuses or lengthy Instagram apologies. After Evan Stephens Hall, the lead singer of alt-country band Pinegrove, was accused of sexual misconduct, the band needed only to take a break for a year before bouncing back with an entire tour. Clearly, indie music has yet to collectively reckon with the long history of misogyny and abuse that comes with the scene. Until that happens, older artists will continue to groom and prey on teenage fans, and up-and-coming female artists will continue to be held in positions of submission or coercion relative to older, more established, and more powerful male artists or industry executives.
Indie music scenes must work actively to make their spaces open to and safe for women. This is not done solely by re-branding labels accused of systemic abuse and misogyny or creating designated ‘safe spaces’ specifically for women — which serve more as a corral to keep othered women and girls in than as a meaningful step towards inclusivity. Scenes must instead hold abusers truly accountable, condemning not just the abuse itself, but the cultures that feed, enable, and cover it up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University controversies, particularly when connected to donations and funding, are frequently spoken of in abstract terms. We frame them as a matter of right and wrong; we describe some investments as "morally abhorrent", and deem Arthur M. Sackler's donations "dirty money." The entire approach is deontological, more concerned with rules of "good'"and "evil" than with the actual impact of the interactions themselves.
Those arguments remain fundamental. They represent the ideological backbone of several of the most promising campaigns on campus, including fossil fuel and private prison divestment, where the immediate material impact of policy changes is minimal or hotly contested. But focusing on whether controversial financial ties are inherently "wrong" can sometimes paint an incomplete picture, ignoring the real, practical consequences that they carry.
Jeffrey E. Epstein's well-documented links to Harvard's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics offer a revealing example. The New York financier served as a prominent Harvard donor for years, until his 2008 conviction on child prostitution charges led to a University-wide ban on accepting direct gifts from him. Yet, as acknowledged by the Office of the General Counsel’s report on the matter, the ties between Professor Martin A. Nowak — director of the PED — and Jeffrey Epstein continued for years; visits, a private office, and access to other faculty were among the privileges accessible to the billionaire sex offender.
These links might inspire moral revulsion. One feels the impulse to detail the numerous ways in which they reveal violations of the values Harvard is supposed to represent; to highlight how Professor Nowak's conduct denotes the kind of corrupting loyalty that unregulated donations inspire; to state that those actions were, in and of themselves, wrong. But doing so would undersell the severity of Nowak's moral infractions. Their impact was never confined to abstract concerns. It was tangible, significant, and burdened by up-and-coming Harvard affiliates.
Two former researchers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they fear professional retribution, agreed to share with me their experience at the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Several other program affiliates declined to speak with me.
Their image and professional output has become tied to the lab and thus to Professor Nowak and Jeffrey Epstein. One of them detailed how they found out, via a third party, that their work and research had been used in a news article to tout Epstein's philanthropic credentials. The 2013 article, which the researcher says they didn't know about or consent to, was in fact part of a broader push by Epstein to launder his public image in the aftermath of his conviction. The public relations strategy led to at least three pieces lauding Epstein, some of them featuring a falsified byline (that is, an author was paid to falsely claim he had written an article), a second one was signed by Epstein's own publicist, Christina Galbraith. The disturbing anecdote wasn't, however, the only time Epstein used PED for his own means. As the University report noted, at the time the article was published, Professor Nowak also approved giving Epstein "a full page” on the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics’ Harvard website, linking him to the project. The researchers who worked there became unwitting accomplices in the task of making a convicted sex offender more palatable to the public.
Those ties, while beneficial to Epstein, could haunt them professionally. As the full extent of the financier's alleged offenses became public, the scrutiny on the lab intensified. The New York broker became toxic almost overnight. By July 2019 The National Review, which had partaken in the public relations effort years back, was calling Epstein “a hideous monster”, discussing how he “continued to socialize with fancy people” even after his arrest. Heads had to roll. Peggy Siegal, a New York publicist who had traded favors with the financier; Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who’d secured him a sweet plea deal; Prince Andrew, for a variety of disturbing reasons.
The extent to which this will impact the academics linked to Epstein remains to be seen. Profesor Nowak, who didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article, has been placed on academic leave. Whether his ties to Epstein — which, according to those two researchers, continued well past the 2018 Miami Herald exposé and included a visit in prison during his 2008 conviction — lead to a more significant response will ultimately be up to the University itself (I wouldn’t hold my breath). University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment for this article.
But that the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics has been tainted by the scandal is undeniable. It has been associated with a moral and legal blunder of gigantic proportions, and (rightly) deprived of its main professor. It will prove hard for either of them, the man or the project, to regain the rosy coverage they enjoyed in the past. One can easily imagine the impact of that bad publicity on the output of the program, and on the individuals linked to it. The two researchers I spoke to highlighted the latter, sharing that their former boss's association with Epstein had a negative impact on their professional lives.
Unwelcome publicity can also prove dangerous — or, at the very least, attract intimidating responses. One researcher shared the impact of being connected to such a highly visible controversy in an era when conspiracy theories (particularly those thematically linked to Epstein’s crimes) seem increasingly dominant on social media. The researcher received an email from a conspiracy theorist (one who felt the need to clarify that he was not 'a crackpot') vowing not to rest until discovering the extent of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics’ links to Epstein. The statement, coming in the aftermath of the 2016 Pizzagate shootings (where one of such false accusations had led to very real bullets being shot) was unnerving, to say the least.
Nowak’s downfall ought to serve as a warning. Detractors of the increased scrutiny on controversial fundraising have a tendency to depict themselves as pragmatic consequentialists, presenting unethical donations as, at worst, a victimless crime crucial to securing funding. According to the University's report, Professors Benedict Gross and Jeremy Bloxham held a comparable position, pushing to revisit the University's 2008 decision and accept direct donations from Epstein on the basis that the "good" his economic support could do for research outweighed any "reputational risk".
Those arguments negate any non-pragmatic moral concerns, and they should be criticized for doing so. But they also obscure the stakes at hand. The human stakes, the scientific stakes; the impact on research, and those who conduct it.
Accepting an academic opportunity shouldn’t mean navigating complex moral dynamics with very limited knowledge; it shouldn’t force researchers to either corrupt their values or confront the leading figures in their fields. And it certainly shouldn’t riddle any unbeknownst accomplices with guilt and stigma — especially if they, unlike their professor, are trying to do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the moment college became a digital experience, the term “virtual community” has become a staple with administrators, clubs, and teaching staff. Considering that the desire to connect with people is so central to both the college experience and our human nature, it is clear that maintaining and improving these virtual communities when no alternative exists is essential.
But virtual communities must be approached with caution. With evidence emerging about unusual fatigue and cognitive overload caused by hours of Zoom meetings, constant notifications, and perpetual use of social media, it is important to consider how virtual communities must be created around standards of self-care. Indeed, it is unfortunate that at a time when we most need communities which transcend geography, these virtual spaces could be extremely detrimental to well being if done incorrectly.
The overuse of online spaces for social interactions has been shown empirically to have detrimental effects on mental health. For the past decade, psychological research has demonstrated that addiction to internet and social media use affects 6 percent of the world’s population and is biologically similar to substance or gambling addictions. Considering that this problematic usage occurs when “social networking is viewed by the individual as an important (or even exclusive) mechanism to relieve stress, loneliness, or depression,” the risk of social media addiction is greater for many of us now than it has ever been before.
Though a social media addiction may not seem particularly serious on the surface, it can have serious consequences. Social media addiction has been linked to poor job performance and burnout, low self-esteem, low life satisfaction, and high stress levels. Particularly dangerous for students, extensive use of social media creates a perceived time distortion. When most students are not on campus to receive the usual physical cues from peers, professors, and the Memorial Church bells to enforce their schedule, the academic and personal ramifications of this time distortion during a college experience in isolation have the potential to be devastating.
However, issues with purely online communication are not just limited to addiction; there are other various subtleties to virtual communities which negatively impact our mental wellbeing. An example is notification fatigue — a feeling which anybody subscribed to a house or dorm email list has surely experienced at some point. A constant influx of notifications has been shown to desensitize individuals to the impact of notifications, lessening their efficacy over time, causing information overload and fatigue in the short term, and pushing a reduction in usage of the platform. Despite the common sense which suggests that more messages will most effectively communicate information and create a feeling of connection, it can have the opposite effect of dissuading individuals from their social platforms altogether.
The pandemic has also brought to light struggles with new online platforms like Zoom – the term “Zoom fatigue” has been coined to describe the unique exhaustion which results from hours of video calls. Unlike the typical weariness one feels after a long day of work, Zoom fatigue results from the inability of video calls to convey non-verbal cues, the mental intimacy of prolonged eye contact, the stress of seeing oneself on screen, and the higher level of attention needed to avoid distraction.
The nature of communication on Zoom is fundamentally different from the communication we have spent our lives learning norms and skills for, down to organizational methods and the distribution of content. Considering that Zoom and similar platforms are the foundation of all virtual communities nowadays, it is necessary to recognize that the goal is not exact replication of our in-person communities, but adaptation to our new circumstances.
With notification fatigue infiltrating messaging platforms, Zoom fatigue infiltrating video calls, and addictive time theft infiltrating social media, there seem to be no good options for maintaining communities and connection while avoiding these adverse effects. Any online platform will come with flaws, as is the nature of attempting to digitally replicate a college experience which was never meant to be online. The uniquely difficult position of administrators, clubs, and professors – who are doing the most to make the best of a bad situation – is not to be understated.
However, perhaps even just becoming more aware of these risks can lead us to use digital spaces in a manner that is respectful of the impact it has on others and on ourselves. It is clear that everybody reacts to the new standards of online communication differently, ranging anywhere from having a preference for digitalization to experiencing an exacerbation of serious mental health struggles and the creation of behavioural addictions. With knowledge of these possibilities, perhaps we can begin to think twice before sending the ninth copy-pasted email pubbing a club or creating frequent mandatory attendance socials.
This pandemic has separated us from each other and introduced us intimately to the throes and nuances of virtual communities. These communities lack the standards, cues, and coping mechanisms we have spent decades curating for physical interaction. Virtual communities are necessary to the college experience for at least the next year, but we must think harder about their boundaries; virtual communities help keep us safe from the coronavirus, but we need to use them carefully to make sure we remain truly healthy.

"Lol" is a funny word — not laugh out loud funny, but ironic in how far it has come from its initial and semi-literal usage. It started out as a sincere reaction, transitioned to a sign of mild amusement, and now often has almost nothing to do with laughter. This is the “lol” we put at the end of a message that sounds too aggressive, too serious, too emo, too … anything. “Lol” as a de-intensifying particle.
English has many de-intensifiers — “a little,” “kind of,” “slightly” — but “lol” stands apart. Think about the difference between texting "I'm a little excited" vs "I'm excited lol." Standard qualifying words serve to specify. When we use “lol” or “lmao,” though, we're instead taking a step back and laughing at whatever we just expressed. “Lol” lets us maintain some ironic distance from our emotions.
“Lol” is also remarkable in its versatility. A Boomer might text "I'm a little upset" or "I'm pretty upset" or "I'm very upset": in all three cases, a Zoomer could use the flexible "I'm upset lol.” It’s very ambiguous, but then again, that’s the point. If I leave it to my friend to decipher the intensity of my feelings through context, he will conclude that I'm exactly as upset as he thinks the situation warrants. I'm protected from judgement.
Zoomer appropriation of "depressed" is another great example of our drive for useful ambiguity. Few Harvard students go a week without hearing the word in some non-literal context, and we're doing something kind of clever when we use it. If I text "I just failed that test, I'm so depressed," I communicate very little. All my friend can say for sure is that I’m somewhere in the open interval bounded by neutral and literally depressed. By exaggerating, we achieve the same ironic ambiguity that we get from “lol."
This kind of ironic detachment was more explicitly embraced by the “high culture” of postmodernism. The horrors of the early 20th century drove a lot of post-war intellectuals to a position that life was a cruel, meaningless joke. The consuming need to signal that they were in on the joke led to a persistent "ironic distance from deep convictions or desperate questions," as David Foster Wallace wrote in “Consider the Lobster and Other Essays.” This year’s various crises have brought out the same instinct toward irony as a coping mechanism in that highest of Zoomer art forms: the meme. Now we’re probably not channeling John Barth every time we text our friends about a comp result, but it’s not unreasonable to think that the attitudes of high culture have bled into the language of our generation as well as its art.
Now widely adopted because of emotionally stunted people like me, “lol”-type language inhibits sincerity even in the well-adjusted. When texts are universally capped with a “lol,” excluding that “lol” becomes more of a statement than it ought to be. Think about the weird weight of texting a plain, "I'm sad." Emotions that are not infrequent in the course of a normal person's life become more difficult to express directly. Adding “lol” allows us to express these vulnerabilities under a protective layer of detachment and heightened self-awareness. And yet, tempted by the convenience of irony and cynicism, we can lose the satisfaction of sincerity and the unmediated closeness it facilitates.
My column is called Harvard Talk, so I feel like I have to finish with some of the institutional solipsism promised. I’ve noticed far more ironic detachment in my Harvard classmates than my highschool ones: why? We're far from the hellscape of the early 20th century, so that's no excuse. Harvard students, I think, have an unusual need to signal that we’re aware of every implication of every word that comes out of our mouths. Expressing sincere disappointment at comp or punch rejections seems ridiculous when we all understand the silliness of Harvard’s elaborate hierarchies. Even sincere excitement at our accomplishments can sometimes feel almost misbegotten when we know how much privilege contributed to them.
Our need to perpetually signal self-awareness runs up against the universal need for honest self-expression. We look for a way to square this circle. And so a mass of “lols” falls upon our texts “like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up the details.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge does not anticipate opening any additional city-run homeless shelters for the impending winter, even as other local shelters are forced to either shutter their doors — like the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter — or operate on reduced capacity — like Y2Y. The emergency shelter that the city is operating, which has a capacity of around 60 individuals, will only continue to be available to those people who are already in the city’s record system.
The City of Cambridge Department of Human Service Programs last reported a census on the homeless population in the city in January 2019, claiming 361 of the 555 city-wide homeless individuals were served by emergency shelters, with an additional 136 in transitional housing. But with economic pressures from the pandemic compounding and shelters closing or reducing capacity, it’s a safe assumption that the number of people being served is far lower while the number in need is far greater.
Two advocates for the homeless population said that their “priority is to provide Cambridge’s homeless community with winter essentials in anticipation of the lack of shelter space.” Unless something changes, many people will have to suffer Cambridge’s harsh winter without shelter, which can and will be fatal. Not too unlike the coronavirus itself.
The coronavirus has exacerbated the fissures of inequality in American society. The virus is not a great equalizer; it is inconvenient for the privileged and devastating for the vulnerable. Harvard cannot allow this cycle to continue with its neighbors.
We recognize that providing shelter in the midst of a pandemic is not easy; social distancing measures mean that in a fixed amount of space, packing in more people increases the risk of virus spread. Further, the logistics are complicated: people will need to be tested, quarantined, and contact-traced.
While all of these added dimensions to providing shelter make it the task more difficult, it is not certainly impossible; we have been completing difficult tasks since the onset of the pandemic — the only variable that has changed here is the target population.
And there is a greater pattern of Harvard shirking responsibility for this population. In the past, Harvard has relied on the largely student-run HSHS and Y2Y shelter to shoulder the responsibility of caring for the homeless population that the University itself has both directly and indirectly contributed to creating through the gentrification of the Square. Now that the majority of the undergraduate population is no longer on campus, these selfless student volunteers can no longer offset the University’s detrimental impact on vulnerable Cantibrigians through their own free labor.
It’s true that Harvard itself would benefit from making sure that its neighbors are healthy, but our primary argument is that it’s morally untenable to have Harvard’s wealth and privilege sit complacently in a neighborhood where the homeless have to choose between freezing and catching the coronavirus. Harvard can no longer dodge this responsibility.
Back in April, Harvard and MIT jointly contributed half a million dollars to the creation of an emergency homeless shelter at the War Memorial Center — we argued then that this was not enough action, and it is certainly not enough now. Winter is coming.

As the COVID-19 pandemic transforms on campus living, Harvard students are confronting a novel ethical dilemma: whether and how to inform on peers who violate public health guidelines.
Though the College has praised students for largely adhering to social distancing norms, reports of large social gatherings in house courtyards and along the Charles River earlier this month invited indignation from fellow undergraduates and administrative rebukes.
Last week, the College announced a new online form through which Harvard affiliates can report infractions of the Community Compact, a set of social distancing and pandemic safety guidelines.
Filing a report can trigger a formal review of the alleged perpetrators by the Community Council, a body founded this fall to arbitrate breaches of the compact. The outcome of such a review may range from a warning, to “community responses” like education, to removal from housing.
When asked about the ethical considerations of students reporting their classmates’ transgressions in a Friday interview, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana called on students to perform “an ethical calculus.”
“There are moments in which good values can feel like they’re in tension with each other,” Khurana said. “The challenge of COVID-19 is that while the immediate awkwardness could be felt in the short term, the not saying something or doing something actually has very long term consequences and medium-term consequences — and often on people who didn't agree to be the recipients of one's consequences.”
Khurana said that Harvard’s dining hall workers, shuttle drivers, “intergenerational staff and faculty community,” and students with underlying conditions are among those for whom students’ negligence could have severe ramifications.
“Leadership is really about learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable,” he continued. “Learning to speak out when you see something that's challenging is probably the most difficult thing, but probably one of the most important things that leaders can do.”
Still, Daniel Shen ’24, who is living on campus, said that few of his friends have availed themselves of the reporting form thus far.
“I think all the students know about this form,” Shen said. “But not a lot of people are actually reporting things.”
“If you're generally a chill person, you don't want to go out of your way to incriminate somebody else, even though it is a very bad decision on that person's part,” he explained. “This further increases the standard it would take for an average person, like maybe me, to submit something on that form.”
Shen said that he thinks a serious infraction — like a party exceeding 20 to 30 people — would merit a report. On the other hand, he said he is more skeptical of the need to report groups of five to six students eating together, which technically exceed the current limit of four.
“Smaller infractions are reasonable because I think, to an extent, almost everybody has had those,” he said. “If you are going to do something, you shouldn't hold other people to a standard above that.”
James Rose ’22 said he opposes “outsourcing” enforcement of the community compact to authorities like the Community Council and Harvard University Police Department. Instead, he said he believes social pressure, “hard conversations,” and sometimes “naming names” are necessary and effective means by which students should hold one another accountable.
Rose criticized students who urge “unity” as an excuse to avoid challenging their peers, but ultimately defer enforcement to administrators and the police.
“It's not that we inherently ought not to have authorities, it's more that we betray our own lack of faith in our ability as a community to uphold those values when we bring in authority,” he said. “If we refuse to challenge each other to uphold our values, we say, ‘Well, we'll never be able to get people to comply. We don't have the strength of character of relationships and bonds holding this community together to survive us critiquing each other.’”
Khurana said that students can avoid confronting these difficult conversations and ethical issues by simply committing themselves to the Community Compact in the first place.
“We should all be in a situation of individual responsibility and mindful of our individual conduct so as not to put our friends in that position,” he said. “I think that's just one of the first things we can do is that we can prevent and not put people we care about in an awkward position.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several faculty-led music ensembles have transitioned this fall to online auditions, rehearsals, and performances in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The vocal and instrumental ensembles will hold no in-person meetings this year, prompting conductors and student leaders to rethink their plans.
Mark E. Olson, director of the Harvard University Band and the Harvard Wind Ensemble, wrote in an email that he initially “did have doubts about virtual music ensembles.”
“Playing in an ensemble is so much more than just being able to play your part,” Olson wrote. “It is about listening and matching sound with the other musicians to create the music the composer or arranger tried to express in the composition.”
Producing music as an ensemble can take longer in the virtual space than it does when the groups prepare for in-person performances, Olson added.
“We need to spend some time in advance of the recording talking about the work and the performance style,” he said. “After recording our parts it may be necessary to re-record certain parts to match each other.”
Jennifer Y. Wang ’22, president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, said she had to spend many extra hours learning to edit and combine recorded orchestral parts in the spring, when the group’s performances first moved online.
“I’ve done a little bit of video editing in the past when I was in high school for my own recordings, but stitching together dozens of videos is very different from that,” Wang said. “My computer is not designed to handle that much information, and for me personally it was an insane amount of work and a huge learning curve.”
“I think for many ensembles on campus, students ended up having to take on that role of editing videos, since we didn’t have time to look for professional editors,” she added.
Federico Cortese, a senior lecturer in the Music Department and director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, said that in order to more easily meld individually recorded parts, he will choose pieces for this fall that have a fairly steady pulse, working in consultation with his students.
“We need to choose music that has a fairly steady metronome, you could say, because otherwise to have eighty people doing a rallentando in the same way is very hard, extraordinarily hard, even if I conduct them one by one,” Cortese said.
But Cortese said that selecting for such pieces is only a starting point in the transition to rehearsing and performing online.
“Even for a good player, you will need to play with a metronome basically right in your ear in order to really stick to the pulse, since players tend to take some time here or there when they play alone,” Cortese said. “And what about intonation, since it is very hard for students to know if they are sharp or flat if they cannot hear the others?”
Music senior lecturer Andrew G. Clark — who conducts the Harvard Glee Club, Harvard Radcliffe Collegium-Musicum, and the Radcliffe Choral Society — said he finds the lack of spaces for students on campus to sing “deeply concerning."
“Ironically, it is the students living on campus, in spaces that are supposed to be more conducive for learning overall, who are in fact finding it harder to participate as singers, since they are in their dorm rooms which have a lot of sound bleed,” Clark said. “It is easy to feel concerned and self-conscious about disturbing people next to you who are also trying to take courses.”
“It’s a problem, I have to be honest with you, but we are doing the best that we can,” Clark added.

Some Harvard alumni said they see recent changes to the composition of the Board of Overseers as a rebuke of the democratic spirit of the Overseers elections, while others see the nominating process as a necessary safeguard against special interests.
On Tuesday, the Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers announced that they had approved a recommendation to require that at least 24 of 30 members of the Board be nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association’s Nominating Committee, rather than by petition.
After a successful campaign by pro-divestment coalition Harvard Forward to elect three recent alumni to the Board of Overseers, there are just three petition spots open for the remaining five election cycles.
Former Sen. Timothy E. Wirth ’61 called the change “a remarkable step back for this great University.”
“Clearly the university felt threatened by calls for greater accountability and by the strong voices for change coming from across the university community,” Wirth wrote in an emailed statement. “Again the administration did not get the message that greater openness, modernization and adaptation was advisable, and chose instead to resist and to change the rules through which new voices have historically been heard in the community.”
Similarly, Todd A. Gitlin ’63, deemed the change a shift towards “autocracy.”
“The Corporation's contemptuous, contemptible rule change is not only a moral abomination but it deserves the strictest attention of the legal authorities,” he wrote.
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessey wrote in an email that the Board of Overseers is entirely elected by alumni, and the HAA’s Nominating Committee is entirely composed of alumni, including at least one who has graduated within the past decade.
English professor James T. Engell ’73 wrote in an email that he too finds the decision “upsetting.”
“It reveals a university governance structure fundamentally fearful of the judgment of its own graduates and clinging to modes in which governance is self-perpetuating: those who govern choose those who govern,” he said. “For the nominating committee to nominate more youthful or diverse overseers does little to change that pattern.”
By limiting the number of petition members of the Board of Overseers, it seems the Corporation deemed the “maximum quota” for dissent to be just 20 percent, Engell wrote.
Still, other alumni said they agreed with the University’s decision to limit the number of petition candidates allowed on the Board of Overseers.
Former Harvard Alumni Association President Alice E. Hill ’81 wrote in an email that she is concerned about external groups with outside funding and special interests influencing the Overseers election.
“It undermines the election and the inclusive process by which the Harvard Alumni Association volunteer board nominates candidates, a process that includes representatives from all parts of the alumni community,” she wrote.
Hill noted that all alumni can propose candidates, including themselves, to the HAA Nominating Committee.
Vanessa W. Liu ’96 wrote in an email that she supports the “crucial” changes.
“They ensure Harvard continues to be governed by a Board that has a duty of care to protect the interests of the University,” she wrote. “It is good governance to ensure the Board is composed of people who represent what the University needs in terms of experience, skills and expertise.”
She added that the Overseers need to be “qualified” to review and assess the University’s schools — which is accounted for by the Nominating Committee.
Tracy “Ty” Moore II ’06, who serves as an HAA Executive Committee Member-at-Large, wrote he is glad the petition candidates are limited to six at any one time, “considering how robust and thoughtful the nominations and selection process is.”
“The petition candidates’ campaigns have become increasingly more professional and very political in nature,” he wrote. “If petitioning had been allowed to continue unchecked, I shudder to think what the Harvard Board of Overseers in 2026 would be striving to achieve, and at what cost.”
However, Yingzi “Sakura” Huang ’13 wrote in an email that there have always been special interest groups, and the change was prompted by “old special interest groups” disliking the emergence of new interest groups, such as Harvard Forward.
“Ideally yes, there would be no special interest groups, but the world is unfair,” Huang wrote.
“Things that shouldn't need advocacy, such as diversity, anti-racism, financial aid, the improvement of the college experience for Harvard students who do not come from privileged backgrounds, require special interest groups and advocacy.”
Environmentalist and former Crimson President Bill E. McKibben ’82 expressed sympathy for Harvard Forward, whose leaders wrote last week that they were “alarmed” by the change.
“I saw how much work those young people put into these elections, and their (as it turns out) naive faith that Harvard was acting with some regard to fair play or honesty,” he wrote in an email. “I don't get disgusted all that easily, but I'm really quite ashamed to be a son of Harvard today.

As Massachusetts’s eviction moratorium is set to end in less than one month, state lawmakers are continuing to push for an extension.
Massachusetts representatives Michael L. Connolly and Kevin G. Honan jointly filed a bill earlier this year to extend the state’s current eviction moratorium — which took effect in April — up to one year after Massachusetts’s COVID-19 emergency declaration expires. The bill comes as public health experts warn of a possible “second wave” of coronavirus infections.
Massachusetts renters are currently protected by a moratorium in effect through at least October 17. Last week, a federal judge said he would likely rule against landlords who sought to challenge the moratorium.
Connolly said a strong moratorium is important in part because it will help combat the spread of the coronavirus.
“Housing stability is really fundamental both to our efforts to try to stop the spread of COVID-19 and as a matter of basic justice considering that housing really should be a human right,” he said.
The Centers for Disease Control recently imposed a nationwide moratorium through December 31. Those guidelines are not relevant to Massachusetts, however, because the “state moratorium is stronger than the CDC order,” according to Connolly.
Patricia D. Jehlen, one of the bill’s major supporters in the State Senate, said evictions disproportionately affect communities of color.
“We've learned that evictions are highest in those areas with many Black and brown residents,” she said.
In addition to extending the eviction moratorium for another year, the bill would also create a state relief fund that would offer aid to property owners and landlords with 15 or fewer units. The bill does not provide the exact details or size of the fund.
Currently, the state-funded Rental Assistance for Families in Transition program provides short-term aid to tenants who are at risk of displacement. The COVID-19 Housing Stability Act “would create an additional housing stability fund with a specific goal of looking to fill in the gaps that are currently not being addressed by [these] existing programs,” according to Connolly.

The Cambridge City Council approved an 18-month extension of City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s contract in a 6-3 vote at a meeting Monday evening.
DePasquale has served as Cambridge’s City Manager since November 2016. The renewed contract employs DePasquale for an additional period, beginning Jan. 9, 2021 and continuing through July 5, 2022. The contract also includes an initial 2.5 percent raise in January 2021 — which will bring DePasquale’s annual salary to $330,937 — followed by two additional 2.5 percent increases in July 2021 and July 2022.
The revised contract, which was initially approved during the council’s meeting on Sept. 14, returned to the docket when Councilor Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 filed a motion for reconsideration Wednesday.
“In my view, the vote taken earlier this week on the city manager (CM) contract was flawed, unclear, and warrants discussion with full transparency,” Nolan wrote in a statement to Cambridge Day last week.
This discussion “could not happen given the circumstances of a vote taken at 1 am based on a document distributed at that time,” the statement reads, referring to the late-night meeting at which the council initially approved the extension.
Nolan’s motion for reconsideration prompted more than two hours of discussion at the city council meeting Monday.
Several city councilors expressed reservations concerning DePasquale’s initial 2.5 percent raise, which is set to take effect in January.
Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, who voted against the revised contract alongside Nolan and Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, raised questions about the purpose of the initial increase.
“Our teachers aren't getting a 2.5 percent increase in January. The Department of Public Works folks, who've been out on the front lines for months and months, they're not getting an additional 2.5 percent increase in January,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
“The two — you know — COLA increases that happen every July, that's normal,” he added. “What I really want to focus on is this additional one in January, and all our city workers aren't getting that. I think it's worth asking ourselves as the council why the city manager does.”
Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA) are increases in Social Security benefits intended to counteract inflation. These adjustments are typically equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers for a specific period. In Cambridge, the city manager typically receives COLA adjustments in July.
Zondervan also expressed concern about the initial 2.5 percent increase, as well as the timing of the 18-month extension.
“This additional raise in January I think is problematic and I don't support it,” Zondervan said.
“It would have been more appropriate to have a one-year extension,” he added. “Then a year from now, we could always extend it again. But instead, by extending it 18 months, we get this weird timing, where now it ends four days after another salary increase.”
Zondervan also said he believes the current council is “punting responsibility” to the next council, who will have to hire a new City Manager when DePasquale’s contract ends.
“I understand the challenges of COVID and all that, but I don't accept that as a sufficient excuse for the way this process has gone down,” Zondervan said. “I think we could have done a lot better.”
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, who serves on the council and voted to approve the new contract, said she is not concerned about the raise because she believes DePasquale has worked very hard over the past six months to address the pandemic.
“We've been talking about the city manager working seven days a week, 24/7,” she said. “I will say for that first six months, I was there — right — I was there with him as we handled a lot of key decisions. I pretty much know that I saw him more than I saw my loved ones.”
“So I’m fine with the increase,” Siddiqui added.
Siddiqui also said she agreed with Zondervan’s “sentiments of where we failed” in regard to the process of hiring the next city manager.
“I do vow I will work on the next process because it is important,” Siddiqui said. “It will involve a lot of the things that did not happen this time around.”

One of the greatest joys of being a college student is having a plethora of volunteer opportunities available year-round. Even if COVID-19 may prevent us from lending a hand in person, there are still countless ways to give back virtually. While the email lists, activities fairs, and Harvard Serves Everywhere newsletters may feel overwhelming, we hope you eventually find an organization or two that you’re passionate about. Read this list for a few programs that are excited to welcome new members — and remember, this list is just a tiny fraction of what Harvard has to offer!
Phillips Brooks House Association
The Phillips Brooks House Association (PBHA) is the go-to hotspot for volunteer opportunities. It is an entirely student-run organization that allows you to give back to the greater Boston community in response to expressed needs. Mentor elementary students through Strong Women Strong Girls, teach English to recent adult immigrants through Chinatown ESL, spend time with the elderly through Alzheimer’s Buddies, or advocate through the Student Labor Action Movement. Here is the long list of all the opportunities available this semester virtually. We can all agree that online bingo with senior citizens is much more enjoyable than a physics pset.
Operation CORE
Operation CORE was created to support Boston Chinatown businesses and mentor high school students for college preparation in response to COVID-19. This organization aims to mitigate the damages caused by xenophobia and prejudice through financial relief. Families pay what they can afford for Operation CORE’s college preparation services, and the money is redirected to its Community Relief Fund. Operation CORE is looking for undergraduate students to volunteer as mentors, so sign up!
Harvard Undergraduates Raising Autism Awareness
Harvard Undergraduates Raising Autism Awareness, otherwise known as HURAA, is an organization that strives to increase awareness and build community in the autistic community in Boston. Undergraduate volunteers interact with members of the autistic community every Friday during “Friday Night Club” events, with various activities including playing Uno, singing karaoke, and coloring. All members and volunteers of HURAA enjoy catching up with one another.
Wave Learning Festival
Wave Learning Festival is another organization initiated as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. It currently has over 10,000 members and offers more than 300 free courses and seminars covering a diverse range of topics, allowing middle and high school students more access to academic support and online resources while schools are closed. You can teach anything you are excited about, from a world language to biology to English. This is also a great way to enjoy a throwback to all your favorite subjects from when you were younger.
Whether you are a first-year student navigating all the available volunteering opportunities or a seasoned senior trying to find a new activity for your final year, we commend you for hoping to make your community a better place. As you can see, there’s something for everyone!
