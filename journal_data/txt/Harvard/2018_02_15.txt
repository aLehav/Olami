“Così Fan Tutte,” the Boston Conservatory at Berklee’s new opera, which ran Feb. 8 through Feb. 10 at the Boston Conservatory, was a humorous performance about the difficulties of love. As the character Despina (Erin Matthews) walked onstage wearing an outrageous doctor disguise, it was clear that the Conservatory revitalized and reworked Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte’s 1790 opera in order to appeal to a contemporary audience. This adaptation fueled hilarity through strange, anachronistic props and costumes, which included an Einstein-esque wig and stethoscope. The show successfully presented a witty retelling of the classic opera packed with jocularity though it cannot make up for the outdated source material’s unfair and problematic portrayal of women.
“Così Fan Tutte” rose to popularity in the 20th century and has remained an oft-performed staple of the opera world. The comedy begins with a conversation between an older man, Don Alfonso (Blair Mellow), and two of his younger male friends, who are completely smitten with their betrothed. Alfonso scoffs at their lovesickness and dismisses the girls’ alleged loyalties, telling his friends Ferrando (Quinn Bernegger) and Guglielmo (John Bitsas) that all women have fickle hearts and are not to be trusted. They make a bet to see whether or not their partners will be faithful. The two men pretend to be drafted for the war, but in reality, disguise themselves and try to seduce the other’s fiancée. Despite the women’s histrionics when the men tell them that they are leaving for war, their beloved partners Fiordiligi and Dorabella recover quickly and are very quickly tempted by infidelity. Lunacy unleashes, shattering expectations and forcing the characters to untangle the comedy of errors that ensues.
The show’s elaborate and eye-catching costumes contrast with the minimalist props, as both the former and latter focus the attention on the storyline and the actors. The production does not experiment with blocking, but sticks to tradition to allow the six actors to spread across the stage or group together in pairs depending upon the scene. The Conservatory’s production skillfully uses lighting to punctuate the plot, with dramatic spotlights highlighting characters during important scenes. Mute coloured lights seep in from the sides of the stage to reinforce the tone of various scenes while the absence of light marks scenes of tension or crisis.
As it condemns women for infidelity while ignoring the two men’s deceit, the plot often feels antiquated, propagating dangerous, old-fashioned gender stereotypes. The very name of the opera, “Così Fan Tutte,” which translates to “All women are like that” only reinforces outdated ideas which pin woman down as the source of all sin. These stereotypes are very much upheld throughout the play. In spite of this, the opera’s ending is mildly empowering: Fiordiligi and Dorabella finally exercise their agency by choosing to ignore their lovers’ impassioned cries of betrayal and hurt. They successfully assuage everyone’s hurt feelings, convincing Ferrando and Guglielmo to forgive them and accept that love often has its ups and downs.
Having said this, “Così Fan Tutte” remains an indisputably humorous opera. The musicality of the Conservatory’s production is masterful: The orchestra played beautifully throughout the whole performance while the actors onstage tackled complex six-part harmonies, rich and endlessly sustained solos, and tricky swelling crescendos with a high level of dexterity. Erin Matthews was particularly talented in her role as Despedina, as she had to switch her singing “voice” multiple times as her character threw on disguises to deceive others throughout the story. Ultimately, the Boston Conservatory performers’ skill level in “Così Fan Tutte,” coupled with the inherent whimsy of the opera, made this a marvelously executed performance.

"Now is the winter of our discontent." When the cast of the Actors’ Shakespeare Project's "Richard III," utters the famed opening line of the titular character's soliloquy, the words bounce off the walls of Swedenborg Chapel in a cascade of echoes. Richard of Gloucester (Steven Barkhimer) enters from the back entrance of the church to finish the rest of the speech, the bright spotlight revealing his arm in a sling and an unmistakable limp in his gait as he walks down the aisle to the front of the chapel. Barkhimer delivers the soliloquy with a rabid fierceness and humor that goes on to characterize the rest of the play. The production, which runs from Feb. 7 to Mar. 11, is directed by Robert Walsh and stars six actors and actresses, who take on multiple roles in order to cover the numerous parts. The play focuses on the rise of Richard as he schemes to steal the crown away from his brother King Edward (Jennie Israel) and his wife Queen Elizabeth (Paula Plum) during the War of the Roses. First, he orchestrates his second eldest brother George’s murder (Michael Forden Walker), blaming Elizabeth and her York supporters for the tragedy. To secure his claim to the throne, he woos and marries the daughter-in-law of the former King Edward, Anne (Mara Sidmore), and kills his nephews, the heirs to the throne. Over the course of two hours, Richard eliminates obstacle after obstacle through his clever manipulation, but it is not long before his paranoia and guilt lead to his ultimate downfall. Shakespeare's Richard is a brilliant character, an underdog with a twisted spine, who overcomes his disability and external skepticism to take over the throne. Barkhimer plays the role very eloquently, showing Richard's charming side and stressing his humor. He is particularly moving during the infamous seduction scene, where he convinces a distraught Anne to marry him, despite having killing her husband. His silky words do more than convince her to join his side–they convince the audience. In Act V, Barkhimer nails Richard's paranoia, but fails to induce much pity from the audience at his death after focusing so much on bringing his Machiavellian characteristics to life.Besides Barkhimer, Jennie Israel, who plays the haunted Queen Margaret, is another standout. She plays Margaret as a haggard, dark madwoman roaming around the chapel cursing her enemies while wielding two yellowed femur bones. The props heighten the witchcraft that Shakespeare imbues in her character, clearly highlighting the unnatural force at work behind the events of this production. She provides a strong contrast to Elizabeth, who Plum plays with begrudging dignity and anger. In the scenes these two actresses share, they thunder with hatred and despair, feelings so clearly present in the script which at times get forgotten. This adaptation understandably eschews these darker emotions in favor of the more comedic aspects of the play, but this choice at times feels slightly overpowering.The production's use of space and set is another part of what makes it successful. The actors move all over the church throughout the performance, striding through the aisles and bursting out of side doors in a way that truly engrosses the audience into the story. The setting of the play in itself lends to the play's lugubrious ambience, with bright white lights casting chilling shadows across the walls of this small, decorous chapel. The setting also plays up Richard's masquerade as a God-fearing man—the instances when he picks up Bibles from the pews or prays are particularly funny due to the backdrop. Costume designer Miranda Kau Giurleo and prop designer Abby Shenker keep the play timeless with minimalist, billowing, monochrome outfits and paired down stakes rather than swords. This ensures that the attention focuses on the show, on the plot, and on the speech, rather than on elaborate costumes and props. It also reminds the audience that this takes place during a time of war and unrest where lives are at stake, not simply during the superfluous politics of court life.
Though the production forfeits a certain amount of darkness by stressing its humor, its timelessness and compelling acting make it both enjoyable and accessible. Altogether, it is a solid production, whose set and design elements do much to make it stand out.

A behemoth of a book, “Gnomon” is almost seven hundred tightly-packed pages, but its complex content is what makes it a difficult read. Nick Harkaway uses words that put the SAT to shame, further complicating the various worlds and concepts introduced throughout the novel. The narrative is fraught with subplots that have little connection to one another besides the word “gnomon” appearing somewhere throughout. Unfortunately the ending is wholly unsatisfying, even after a reader must laboriously attempt to understand the story and search for a conclusion. After such a long, strenuous read, the finale needs to be worth the work, but this is where “Gnomon” falls short.
Harkaway comes out of the gate using words that, for most, take a second thought or a quick dictionary search. Early on, “Gnomon” is peppered with words such as “vertiginous” and “apocatastasis” that make the writing sound impressive. However, the same long, complex words appear time and time again. By the end of the novel, the reader will most likely have seen the word “apocatastasis” more times than they ever have or ever will in their entire life. What initially makes the book unique quickly becomes tiring.
Harkaway has the uncanny ability to craft complex universes. Every narrative is complicated in its own way.  One takes place in a version of London where there is no privacy (not even within one’s own mind), another in a video game in the real world that models Harkaway’s strange London, one in ancient Greece with complex alchemy, and a universe where a single being can inhabit the minds of thousands of bodies. Art takes a form that transcends our current concepts, technology is advanced enough to extract whole memories from human minds safely, and one mind can be on millions of planets at once. The many settings are diverse, including Ethiopia, Greece, London, and undiscovered planets.
Although imaginative and entertaining, the inherent problem is that Harkaway is attempting to explain settings and situations that we have no context for in the real world, so the English language does not do it justice. Particularly, his explanations of art are enough to tickle the fancy but not fleshed out for true understanding. For example, Harkaway tries to explain works of art that appear over five large canvases that are made to be seen separately and all at once, simultaneously. It is also hinted that a fifth dimension is necessary to appreciate and understand the work.  It is unclear if the reader’s uncertainty of the art is part of the beauty of creating such diverse worlds, or if it is a way to mask a lack of depth.
A great strength of “Gnomon” is also a weakness. Although there are so many brilliant settings, there are too many. Early on, before the initial London is fully explained, Harkaway switches narratives. This is confusing because it is unreasonable for the reader to understand that some of the narratives are falsely constructed memories extracted from a character in the initial London. Far too many plots are introduced before their places in the book as a whole are clear. Furthermore, each individual universe is so intricate that a large portion of the novel is dedicated to simply explaining the logistics of the world. The constant descriptions bog down the narrative. While beautiful and imaginative, the various plots amount to an information overload.
To put it lightly, “Gnomon” requires more work than the average novel. To read the book properly requires focus, contemplation, and a substantial time commitment. Theoretically this should lead to a rewarding reading experience. However, the ending is swift and not well-explained. There are many directions Harkaway could have taken, yet it seems he chooses the least complex—and least satisfying—of the viable options. Harkaway dedicates too much time and effort into world-building, and not nearly enough into deciding what sort of message and impression the ending leaves on his readers. Although fabulous and unique, the worlds he creates are not enough to overpower the lack of a satisfying ending.

Shrill repeated screams filled the air—“Grace, Grace, Grace!”—as Grace VanderWaal, the 14-year-old “America’s Got Talent” winner, strolled onto the stage. On Feb. 5, the girl with the ukulele performed her hit songs to a sold out show. Her performance, though fresh in the songs and delivery, suffered from an unimaginative stage and an blaring sound.
Grace VanderWaal’s setlist explored topics of gossiping, immature boys, and true friendship. In comparison to the most popular songs of the childhood singers of my day, the Jonas Brothers, her songs are mostly devoid of the hopeless romance in top hits like “Burnin’ Up” and “S.O.S.” Singing about the topics that truly affect her allowed her to connect with young audiences in an honest way.
One of the stand-out songs that VanderWaal performed was “Gossip Girl,” which is about one of her friends spreading rumors about her behind her back. In it, VanderWaal emphasizes her relatable side as she exposes her struggle with how to approach the situation: “Not trying to point you out here / Just making the facts clear, that I have found.” She proved to be a versatile performer—her energy was palpable as she jumped around the stage during the chorus to the loud music, and she knew to slow things down when she got to the bridge to showcase her powerful Taylor Swift-esque voice. She sounded just as she did on television when she performed for “America’s Got Talent.” One of the songs that allowed her vocals to truly shine is “Beautiful Thing,” a fan favorite. Indeed, the whole venue was singing along with her, though none could match her range.
Grace VanderWaal’s engaging demeanor on stage was a memorable part of the concert. She showcased her animated persona while telling a story to the audience about her song “Talk Good,” emphatically explaining how she was blindsided on an important phone call and struggled to express herself well. Later on in the studio, she was telling her producer about the encounter and they bonded over similar experiences. As a result, they wrote “Talk Good,” which is relatable to everyone who has had an awkward encounter.
While Grace VanderWaal’s attitude and songs were aptly relevant to her young audience, the Sinclair provided a somewhat contradictory backdrop to the affair. The venue’s darkness and bare-bones stage contrasted sharply with VanderWaal’s energy. This stage would have been more appropriate for the more typical alternative or rock group that the Sinclair usually features. In addition to the physical setting, the acoustic settings were too loud and had too strong of a bass, causing some of the younger kids to complain about the noise. But by the end of the concert, those same kids were grinning ear-to-ear, finally used to the loud music.
Charming and sincere, Grace VanderWaal’s performance promises more hits further down the road. She resonated with the audience because of her raw vocal talent and magnetic stage presence.

Reviewing a BROCKHAMPTON concert is a vexed art—the thoughtful disengagement required is impossible to muster. Once Ameer Vann walked onstage shortly after 9 p.m. on February 5th, peeled off his surgical mask, and replaced his black jumpsuit for an orange one, you couldn’t be the guy in the corner, scribbling in a notepad. People were shrieking, leaping, and reaching desperately for the stage. Every second from that point on was a call to immerse yourself completely in sound and movement. It felt like an initiation into a community bound only by music and exuberance, open to all.
The five other primary performers of BROCKHAMPTON—Kevin Abstract, Matt Champion, JOBA, Dom McLennon, and Merlyn Wood—leapt out of the wings, all sporting eerily familiar orange jumpsuits. The general admission crowd, scattered throughout the pit only moments beforehand, immediately contracted into a 20-foot-wide block of flesh in front of the stage as BROCKHAMPTON launched into “BOOGIE,” the raucous opening track of their most recent album, “SATURATION III.” They had performed it four days earlier in Times Square for MTV’s “Total Request Live” reboot, and they brought the same world-conquering charisma to the House of Blues, the sublime unstoppability of a storm.
A year ago, you wouldn’t have expected this star power from BROCKHAMPTON. The 15-man “boy band” had one middling mixtape to their name, fittingly titled “ALL-AMERICAN TRASH.” Much of the group’s following seemed to be carryovers from mastermind Kevin Abstract’s nascent solo career. Then they had a show on Viceland, “American Boyband.” Then they dropped three albums in seven months. This prolificacy wouldn’t be so impressive if BROCKHAMPTON didn’t exhibit in half a year the kind of growth that takes most artists half a decade. They were a competent curio in June, with the release of the first “SATURATION” album. By the end of 2017, they had two flawless records under their belt. BROCKHAMPTON are like the Omnidroid: They learn constantly and adapt instantly.
The House of Blues stage was sparsely decorated: a traffic light, a few white swivel chairs, and a Simpsons sofa facing upstage. BROCKHAMPTON ignored these props for the most part, except during moodier songs like “FACE,” when each member would sprawl on the furniture until it was their turn to saunter to center stage and deliver a verse. As bare-bones as this setup was, the concert still managed to be a spectacle, in part because BROCKHAMPTON knew all the familiar elements of a concert and made them panoramic. You want a dramatic lull? Here are five minutes—comically long, in real time—of the group standing silently in the dark, waiting for the crowd to quiet itself. You want banter? Here’s Abstract announcing that BROCKHAMPTON are pivoting to stand-up comedy, then (justly) crowning Vann “Sexiest Man of the Year” instead of “all these basic-ass white people.” You want an encore? Here’s “HOTTIE,” “HEAT,” and four (four!) more iterations of “STAR.” And a moshpit? Here's a—actually, that’s pretty weak. Blame it on the audience.
Apart from this maximalist take on concert conventions, the biggest surprises were the individual performances. Some played out as expected: Wood and JOBA, the gleeful crowd favorites, strutted and twisted as the audience chanted their names. Yet Champion’s slacker charm, so arresting on record, was indiscernible onstage. This becomes less surprising given greater scrutiny, as he specializes in casually bobbing and weaving around the beat, permanently unruffled—his level of energy could hardly match that of his impossibly hyped bandmates. The same applies to Vann, whose sly, usually scene-stealing charisma barely registered among all the bustle. Meanwhile, McLennon, who seems to substitute pure technique for personality in the studio, dominated in person. Whether bounding across the stage, head whipping back and forth, or sitting at its edge, crooning as dozens of hands paw at him, he managed to access unforeseen stores of aggression and tenderness. In the most pleasant surprise of the night, Bearface, BROCKHAMPTON’s resident crooner and the least integrated member, had his own two-song showcase. Alone with his guitar, awash in blue light, he offered a five-minute glimpse of an alternate reality Ed Sheeran, one who’s actually interesting and doesn’t write about how his bedsheets smell.
Yet all this talk presupposes a knowledge and investment in BROCKHAMPTON, the kind that can convince hundreds of kids to stand outside the House of Blues in a line a fifth of a mile long, so cold that it was difficult to curl my fingers. What makes this profound love for the band possible is the ease with which one can identify with them. BROCKHAMPTON themselves cultivate this image of regular, underrepresented people, just like you and me—from the origin story (they purport to have met on a “Kanye To The” forum), to the taxonomy (they insist that they’re a “boy band” to “change the standard” for who can be in one), to the production of their content (all sourced from their shared home in Van Nuys, CA, aptly called “The Brockhampton Factory”).
Perhaps the most salient example of this unprecedented, boundary-breaking appeal is Abstract’s frankness about his sexuality, which feels revolutionary in an age when some of rap’s luminaries are delivering lines like, “I cannot vibe with queers,” or remarking that “the world is not right” after a fellow emcee comes out as gay. If that seems hyperbolic, here are some straight guys tripping over the “JUNKY” line, “He gave me good head, peepin’ out while the windows tinted.” While the presence of an openly gay man in rap is important and refreshing (“I do the most for the culture, n***a, by just existing”), so too is Abstract’s approach to the subject, running the gamut from harrowing to hilarious in as little as two lines: “Where I come from, n****s get called ‘f****t’ and killed / So I’ma get head from a n***a right here.” This aspect of BROCKHAMPTON resonates deeply with fans—the crowd at the House of Blues was at its loudest when reciting lines like “I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain’t listen?” and “‘Why you always rap about bein’ gay?’ ‘Cause not enough n****s rappin’ be gay,” and Abstract’s quip “Tell your mom and dad that BROCKHAMPTON’s pushing the gay agenda on their children!” drew the most fervent cheers.
BROCKHAMPTON stress that you are valid, you have a voice, and you could be up on that stage if you wanted to. In other words, BROCKHAMPTON are you. They underline this point at every concert—in episode two of “American Boyband,” a laptop broke in the middle of a sold out Boston show, and Abstract had no instrumentals to perform over. He returned to the green room, frustrated, and mulled over his options. Do it a cappella? Sing over the mp3s? He went back out and told the audience, “I feel bad, ‘cause you guys aren’t getting to experience this tour like everybody else. So, I’m really sorry. This sucks, I know. I guess we could just treat this like a prom or something. Is it okay if I just play the album and hang out with you guys right here?” And he descended into the crowd. He swayed with his fans, he moshed with them, he sang along to his own songs with them. They huddled around him, hugged him, took selfies with him. Abstract took this crisis as an opportunity to reiterate his ethos, demolishing the fourth wall, breaking the barrier between performer and audience. He moved among his fans, equal to them.
There was a parallel incident at the House of Blues. For the penultimate performance of “STAR,” Abstract called all audience members with blue facepaint and/or orange jumpsuits to the stage. Once the crowd had emptied itself of everyone matching that description, a dozen others scrambled onstage, unremarked upon—it seemed like anyone was allowed up. As BROCKHAMPTON performed “STAR” once more, this assortment of random fans moshed among them joyfully. It felt like one more instance of euphoric egalitarianism, BROCKHAMPTON’s calling card.

Filled with the melancholic wail of synthesizers and the driving trap drums of his contemporaries, Rich Brian’s “Amen” is, for most part, an excellent freshman album. “Amen” is the first full-length project of Indonesian rapper Rich Brian, who came to prominence after his music video for his single “Dat $tick” went viral. Although once known as the comedic rapper Rich Chigga, Rich Brian’s album shows that he is capable of serious musical expression. Some tracks—including “Kitty” and “See Me”—fall flat when the production gets sloppy. Despite this, the album is generally very well-made, and at times unexpectedly compelling.
The title track of the album, “Amen,” opens the project with a stripped-down, bass-heavy drum beat underneath Rich Brian’s opening bars. The title track, much like the entire album, is filled with braggadocious claims, deft lyrical maneuvering, and meaningful insights. The album as a whole discusses love, longing, and, in the case of “Amen,” what it means to be an Asian man in hip-hop. Rich Brian ends the track with a powerful statement: “Do this shit for the people that look like me / So the girls can see them and think of me / And not that kid that throw that fit / Cause he didn’t get straight A’s all week.” These are the types of insights to expect throughout “Amen,” a surprise to many fans but certainly a good one. Lyrically speaking, “Amen” shows off Rich Brian’s impressive baritone flow. Although he has released some solid lines prior, it is throughout “Amen” that Brian shows the world what he is capable of writing.
Production-wise, the album is a major step forward for Rich Brian, who is known for making his own beats. The album represents a distinct stylistic change from intense, major-key, party-type beats to a more melancholic and introspective sound. While the album certainly includes more aggressive tracks, including “Attention (feat. Offset)” and “Enemies,” the work as a whole is notable for its inventive, almost sad-indie-pop usage of synthesizers on songs such as “Cold,” “Introvert (feat. Joji),” and “See Me.”
The closest the album comes to a misstep is on track 11, “Kitty.” “Kitty” details Rich Brian’s first time being with a woman, calling to mind J. Cole’s masterpiece, “Wet Dreamz” off of “2014 Forest Hills Drive,” which some may call one of the best rap albums of the 21st century. “Kitty” diverges from “Wet Dreamz” in that it is a more vulgar take on the subject matter, possessing none of the innocence of its predecessor. Furthermore, when compared to the beats throughout the album, the instrumentation and production on “Kitty” is certainly a cut below the rest. There are very few synthesizers, and the beat is given a bare-bones feel to make way for the storytelling, which does not adequately fill the gap left by the instrumentation.
Thematically, the album is filled with a brooding, introspective darkness, often touching on the emptiness of money and the fleeting nature of love and lust. This introspection is most present in the album’s surprisingly and delightfully poetic “Glow Like Dat.” Throughout the song, Rich Brian details the complex emotions he’s been processing following a tough breakup. The aforementioned “Glow” refers to the aura of positivity with which he sees his ex, while he is filled with sadness and apathy towards the outside world. Even though they remain apart, Rich Brian laments that “[she] live in my head without a doubt.” Musically, the piece features an arpeggiated synthesizer resembling plucked strings over a kick-drum heavy light trap beat, which serves to build a contemplative mood throughout the piece. In this song, it is abundantly clear that Rich Brian is asking the world to seriously consider his emotions and his art. This represents a massive transformation from Rich Chigga, the fanny-pack wearing, Hennessey-holding, comedic rapper, into Rich Brian, a complex artist capable of both hot bars and legitimate introspection.
While “Amen” is several steps away from a masterpiece, it is a solid contribution to the field and a beautiful look into the reborn Rich Brian. The album is for the most part well-produced, the vocal performance is refreshing and skilled, and the beats are well-layered and for lack of a better word, banging. All in all, over the course of the album Rich Brian presents a compelling portrait of himself and the new music he is capable of making.

Housing Day is fast approaching. For upperclassmen, it provides an opportunity for a raucous outpouring of House pride. Yet many freshmen may still have reservations concerning Harvard’s system of housing and the blocking process at large. We recognize these concerns, and we believe that—from blocking to Housing Day—Harvard’s housing system provides ample opportunity for adjustment to House life, maintenance of social relationships, and exploration of new friendships.
Yet despite Harvard’s efforts to make the transition to upperclassman housing seamless, blocking season can be a time of great apprehension. The stress of forming a group capped at eight people can begin months ahead of the deadline, and especially for students who feel that their friendships span multiple social groups. Upon the return from winter break, this anxiety rises to the forefront for many freshmen, adding additional pressure to the beginning of their second semester. However, blocking is often made out to be much more difficult and scary than it actually is.
When freshmen select their blocking group or choose to block alone, they are not selecting their social circle for the next three years. In fact, it is important not to conflate blocking and rooming, as living situations are only determined after Housing Day. While many sophomores live with their blockmates, many more do not. Inter-House transfers are also an option for students dissatisfied with Housing Day. Yet the vast majority of seniors last year reported that they were satisfied with their House’s living situation, indicating that home can be found anywhere along the river or in the Quad.
Essential to any good home, however, is its a comfortable level of noise and cleanliness. Freshmen would thus do well to recognize that not all friends are necessarily compatible roommates, and not all compatible roommates are necessarily the best of friends. Furthermore, the housing system allows for great flexibility in who students actually live with—if dynamics within a blocking group change, there are always ways to revise arrangements.
So for students worried about how to stay close with their Gregorian chant-loving friends without tearing their hair out, linking can be an excellent way to maintain close bonds as well as healthy boundaries. On that note, we strongly recommend not blocking with a significant other. In fact, we very strongly recommend against it.
Though location is certainly not the definitive factor in whether relationships last, living in the same vicinity can be an important way to maintain connections, especially with friends in different classes or activities. Maintaining these relationships starts now, by having productive, honest, and occasionally uncomfortable conversations with blockmates, linkmates, or friends.
Often, blocking complications arise from poor communication or lack of transparency between friends. We urge freshmen not to delay hard blocking conversations. Stringing a friend along, only to avoid blocking with them last minute, leaves them in an unfair predicament that easily could have been avoided with a five minute chat.
Of course, our words of practical wisdom are unlikely to appease freshmen currently Googling “what blocking configuration guarantees me a single in a River House that isn’t Mather” (spoiler alert: there isn’t one). There are certainly concrete ways in which the College could make upperclassman housing less stressful, and we urge House administrators to increase social programming for rising sophomores, including during spring semester, to integrate them into House life.
Yet as freshmen look ahead to their awaited blocking decisions and Housing fate, they should also bear in mind that their Harvard experience thus far is only one chapter in a much longer story. The first year of navigating Harvard life can feel both underwhelming and overwhelming. It can be chaotic, confusing, and stressful.
The beauty of Housing Day is that it is symbolizes a new start. The reality of college life is that communities constantly change, grow, and emerge—often for factors out of our control, and sometimes from unexpected sources (we’re looking at you, the elusive few who actually get placed in Kirkland). Somewhere among the cheesy House t-shirts, gawking tourists, and screaming upperclassmen, we hope freshmen can see a flash of that beauty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My flight is taking off in 12 hours, and I’m cleaning the bathroom.  And you should clean yours.
I know you’re thinking I’m crazy, but just hear me out. Cleaning the bathroom is my oldest ritual. (I developed it sometime around middle school.) The method is tried and true, down to the order in which I clean. I pour bleach into the tub, and scrub it until my knuckles get red and the perforated surface is gleaming white. Then I scrub the toilet, seeking that pristine sheen when every nook and cranny is clean. I wipe down the counter, get my Clorox wet wipe in between the silver handles of the sink. I spray Windex on the mirror until my reflection is as crisp as reality. Finally, I sweep the floor—and I also wash it, just in case anything has gotten into the crevices or crannies. Though my mom had no problem with my need to clean back in middle school, now it befuddles her. She tells me every semester not to worry about it, to focus on more important things. These important things include my school work (like picking classes before shopping week starts) or my extracurricular work (like Crimson pieces I tend to procrastinate on) or even something practical like packing (which isn’t my strong suit either—the clock is ticking, but my clothes are still in the laundry). Besides, it makes no sense—my knuckles are red from bleach that I won’t even see the benefits of, since I’ll be gone for the next few months. But none of that matters. In that moment, hours before I will be re-submerged into the craziness that is Harvard, I need to clean.  At school, my ritual continues. It’s a newer one, and it extends beyond the bathroom, but things aren’t much different. I vacuum the floors until they’re spotless (the trickiest spots are the carpet in the common room and the tiles under the bathroom counter). I return to Clorox wipes for the bathroom counter, and I make do with what I have to wipe down the toilet too. I do this even when I have a paper, a midterm, or anything else. The reason I started cleaning so obsessively is because for me, cleaning the bathroom is cathartic. It’s not exactly fun work. It’s definitely not glamorous. The bleach stings. I’m not the tallest person, so I usually end up bent in half, reaching the bottom of the tub, with my knees scraping the floor. I’m a perfectionist too, so it takes me a while—even the thin film of dust that accumulates at the top edge of the cabinet drawers doesn’t escape me. But there is nothing better than that feeling, when finally, after everything, it’s all perfect.The reason I’ve kept cleaning is because it grounds me. A clean space is something that I often take for granted in my daily life—whether it be the perfectly arranged chairs in Lamont Cafe, the public bathrooms on campus, or even my own en-suite bathroom. It’s something we all take for granted. However, behind the comfort that we don’t even think about is the labor of hundreds of workers and even some of our own peers working in Dorm Crew. When I clean my bathroom, I find that I invariably think about the work of all those people. I’ve found that by doing, I can achieve understanding, and I gain value and perspective. When I set aside summer internship applications or my half-finished (or not started) response paper to clean my bathroom, I remember that cleaning is just as critical as my academic work. It is difficult, and it feels thankless, but it makes a huge difference to my own peace of mind and quality of life when it’s done.Ultimately, there is something humbling about putting Harvard aside to clean the toilet. I’m not saying that you’re doomed to be a bad person if you never get down and dirty like that. But I am saying that here, we can all use a bit of humbling. Too often, here at Harvard, we get entangled in grandiose theories and great plans. In sections and dining halls, we engage in self-important debates about how to empower the working class and how to achieve social equality. At the same time, we retreat further and further into our ivory tower, until a simple task like cleaning the bathroom that we use becomes something that is beneath us.Sometimes, it’s important to put ambition aside to live and grow in experience and understanding. Many of us have been exposed to glamorous experiences in our lecture halls or on Harvard-funded trips on the other side of the world, but we can’t forget the importance of the other half. We can’t forget that we must stay grounded in these tasks that bring us back to reality.So next time you’re home, or maybe next time your in-suite bathroom starts to get a little gross—pick up a sponge, get some wet wipes. And get in there. You’ll come out a little sweatier, a little more tired. But I promise, you’ll be satisfied with your work—and more importantly, you’ll know a little more about the world then you did when you started.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Southerners are stupid. At least, that’s what was implied. I sat in the back row of a crowded lecture hall and listened to the professor remark, with little reasoning or explanation, that Trump won the presidency because his “six-hundred-word vocabulary” resonated with poor, white Southerners. Apparently poverty is synonymous with illiteracy, and illiteracy went hand in hand with the 2016 Republican vote. I didn’t know whether to be insulted by this absurd logic, or to simply laugh at it.
The American South is saturated by mostly unfounded negative stereotypes. In a place as vividly conscious of political correctness as Harvard, I didn’t expect those stereotypes to be so blatantly perpetuated, even though those stereotypes have been depicted in the media and pop culture for years. While combing through about a dozen Southern photo-essays for a research paper last semester, I found exactly what I expected: the South was almost exclusively portrayed in images of crazed religion, white supremacy, and above all, dire poverty. If you judged the South by these images, you’d think it was nothing more than a poor, wild, lawless wasteland. But we’re at Harvard, and we should know better than to take things at face value. To accept Southern archetypes is to foolishly dismiss the beautiful intricacies of the South I know.
There was no doubt about the favored candidate in my town. The 2016 presidential election was contentious across the nation, but in central Appalachia, there was an overwhelming consensus: Blue Trump signs, big and small, dotted front yards, business windows, and car bumpers. Each one a sign of unintelligence, if this professor is to be believed.
Now, I come from a white, working-class, Southern, Trump-voting family. I didn’t support Trump in the election, but over 80 percent of the voters in my county did, and for a good reason. Appalachia’s main concern was the economy; the coal industry has been drying up for years, and Trump at least feigned interest in reviving it (an out-of-context comment Clinton made about “put[ting] … coal companies out of business” doomed her chances of election in southern West Virginia, east Kentucky, and southwest Virginia).
It may seem foolish and naïve to those who have never lived there, to those who have never witnessed the hopelessness of poverty or been threatened by a possibly permanent loss of career, but in such an economically and socially depressed region, any display of concern, any ray of hope is something to cling to. Those votes were cast purposefully, despite what any Harvard professor or other Trump opponent thinks. Southerners didn’t vote for Trump because he communicates with an elementary vocabulary and they’re too illiterate to understand otherwise; they didn’t vote for Trump because they were too ignorant to know what they were voting for. They knew exactly what they were voting for. Don’t get me wrong; this means that some—a very small percentage—did vote for Trump because they’re racist and sexist and just plain scummy people with horrible, backwards beliefs. But not every vote for Trump was a vote for hatred, violence, and inequality—despite all the media coverage, there are very, very few radical racist Dylann Roofs and Charlottesville neo-Nazis. Not every vote for Trump was a vote against social justice. In truth, social justice issues aren’t a burning concern when you don’t know if you’ll be able to feed your family next month.Poverty and whiteness is not confined to the South, and neither were Trump voters. A quick glance at Southern demographics and a 2016 electoral map can show that. This professor’s statement proves that a narrative of Southern ignorance still exists. It’s time to stop perpetuating outrageous misconceptions about the South; Southerners shouldn’t have to defend against antiquated stereotypes at a college known especially for its innovation and brilliance. Insulting an entire demographic’s intelligence has no positive effect—quite the opposite, really—and proves no one’s ignorance but your own. Insults only deepen the divides, which is the last thing America needs right now. After all, intelligence is not measured by income, race, geography, or check marks on a ballot. Stereotypes will continue to survive unless we look beyond appearances and learn to question what we’ve always seen, what we’ve always been told. The South is beautiful, intricate, and relevant. The South is intelligent, and the South will overcome the old, tired stereotypes that have for far too long attempted to repress it. Emilee A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2017, Republican lawmakers instituted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is expected to cut into Harvard’s endowment by over $40 million. Last week, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith expressed concerns with regard to the tax bill’s impact upon the FAS, which receives nearly half of its income through the endowment.
In this time of fiscal uncertainty, Harvard should ensure that its fine arts programs do not get left behind. President Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated a desire to undermine federal arts funding by eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts. Now more than ever, it is necessary for Harvard to prioritize funding for the arts.
All fine arts-related departments fall under the FAS and are therefore at risk of financial strain due to the Republican tax bill. In the past, Harvard’s commitment to artistic programs has come under scrutiny. As Harvard begins its expansion into Allston and continues to devote considerable funding and energy to its STEM programs, administrators must maintain a commitment to the preservation of the arts on campus through both academic and extracurricular programming.
Until the development of the Department of Theater, Dance, and Media in 2015, Harvard lacked any formal theater department. Instead, theater classes were simply incorporated into the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies. TDM offers students the opportunity to participate in professionally directed and designed productions each semester, and it marks a welcome addition to Harvard’s support for the arts.
Still, the TDM department does not necessarily serve all students involved with the performing arts on campus, nor could it. The same might be said of the VES Department, which can only do so much to support the visual arts beyond the scope of its programming. In order to preserve and promote artistic engagement on campus, the University must reach beyond the scope of its own concentrations and devote more resources directly to the performing and visual arts.
Concentrations in the fine arts have never been particularly popular at Harvard. In 2015, only 16 students graduated with degrees in VES. The Music Department also remains small, with only six concentrators graduating in the Class of 2015.
However, these low numbers do not reflect the vast number of students who engage with the fine arts on campus. Hundreds of people participate in theatrical productions each semester as actors, directors, designers, or technicians, most of whom do not concentrate in TDM. Still more participate in film, visual arts, choirs, orchestras, and a capella groups, with concentrations ranging from Comparative Literature to Chemistry.
Most of the funding for extracurricular theatre comes from grants from the Undergraduate Council rather than directly from the University itself. That is, while Harvard’s student body is determined to support theater, much of the University administration seems to lack a similar outlook. Many House theater spaces on campus could use renovations, and performing arts on campus could vastly benefit from additional support and subsidies.
Athletics, by comparison, do not face this problem. In the 2009-2010 school year, the Department of Athletics spent nearly $18 million on its teams. This contrasts sharply with the limited amount that the Office of Fine Arts grants students each semester for their various projects.
2018 is a terrifying time to be an artist in this country. From public schools to national museums, federal priorities are shifting against the arts. Harvard’s priorities must shift as well. As the Republican tax bill puts Harvard’s endowment at risk, the University must remember not to neglect the arts.

If you hop on the Quad shuttle late enough on certain nights, you—bleary-eyed, sweatpanted epitome of college study habits—might find yourself trying to make sense of a strangely peppy, heavily made-up human hauling a giant suitcase up the bus’s steps.
Your companion is Maureen Tang ’20, and she’s not surprised that you’re staring.
“Sometimes I get weird looks on the shuttle,” she says. “People are like, ‘Why is this girl wearing so much makeup, why does this girl have her hair done all nice? It’s just a Monday night, what’s going on?’”
Tang has grown accustomed to the late-night shuttle etiquette. She makes this trek regularly on her way home from TD Garden, where the Boston Celtics play, and where she performs as a professional dancer for the Boston Celtics.
Hence the accoutrements.
Tang’s odyssey started last year, when she was inspired by Peyton E Peters ‘17, then a senior, who managed to balance life as a student and Celtics’ Dancer. Over the summer, when Tang found herself coincidentally in Boston on the audition dates for the team, she began to speculate: “If Peyton made it possible, then maybe I can make it work as well.”

Tang started dancing at nine years old. She has trained rigorously since then in a mix of styles ranging “from ballet to tap and jazz, lyrical, hip-hop, contemporary, a little bit of ballroom.” So when she walked into the audition this summer, she felt “physically prepared,” as she puts it, to dance at the requisite standards.
But even beyond the technical skills she needed to master for the team, Tang says her particular experience growing up as a dancer prepared her uniquely for the intensities of her job.
“Because my mom was a single mother, she had to work all the time,” Tang says. “So a lot of times at competitions, going to rehearsals and everything, I was very much on my own. And I think that taught me a lot about independence. A lot of times I had to walk to the dance studio to go take class and go to rehearsals, try really hard and find rides to go to dance competitions and dance conventions.
“I think that because my mom wasn’t there—obviously she was so supportive of what I was doing, she loves watching me dance—but because she wasn’t able to be there a lot of times, it taught me how to motivate myself more than anything,” she adds.
Now, Tang finds strength in her personal sense of ambition. She joined the team “because I wanted to challenge myself. I wanted to grow as a dancer. I wanted to grow as a person,” she says. “It wasn’t really to prove anything, it wasn’t so I could look cool.”
Her resolute attitude forms a particular asset given the pressures that come with performing for such large crowds so frequently.
She acknowledges the intensity of dancing for a stadium with a capacity to seat 20,000, particularly since the event can be televised to “millions” more. She admits to getting “really, really nervous” before performances. But “although I do feel pressure,” she says, “I think that comes from myself more than anyone else.”
She also finds her perspective on dancing helpful when grappling with the nuances that can complicate the notion of female entertainment, especially under the gaze of a mostly male demographic.
“This entire experience has made me question a lot, like, standards of beauty, and standards for women,” she says. For Tang, the act of dance in itself is profound—“I feel like when I dance, I’m a storyteller,” she says—but the larger experience of performance is equally personal, even if it inherently requires subscribing to certain standards.
She reflects on the group dialogues that she and her fellow dancers often share after games and meet-and-greets. They discuss their costumes, hair, and makeup, as well as perceptions about their “role as dancers and how we’re perceived by other people.”
“At the end of the day, whenever we have conversations like these in the locker rooms, I feel like we always just come to the conclusion that we do this for ourselves, we’re all here for our own reasons,” she says.
Tang also bonds with the other dancers via the hectic schedules they lead off the court. Everyone juggles multiple identities, she explains. She finds it “motivating to see that all these girls are working full-time jobs, and they’re doing this… and have a whole bunch of other responsibilities, as well.”
Balancing school and dance can require “sacrifices,” she says. It’s during times like her frequent shuttle rides that Tang feels the strain of inhabiting both her identities—student and professional dancer—most acutely. “I feel like I kind of have to act differently in both spaces,” she says. “I’m entering a different world, leaving the Harvard bubble”
But she revels in both sides of her personality, and always has. “Growing up, coming from a low-income background, me and my family often had to move a lot. And there really just wasn’t much consistency in my life,” says Tang. “I think that because I always had school and I always had dance, those two things have always meant so much to me because they kept me grounded, even when everything around me was changing and for me.”
Now that she dances for the Celtics, she’s found herself caught in another kind of liminal space: between two teams she loves. She describes her family as “huge Lakers fans.” So who does she root for when the teams meet?
She giggles, looking a tiny bit guilty.
“The Celtics, of course!”

What’s the most expensive outfit you’ve ever worn?
Unless you’re very into high fashion, it can’t be worth
much more than what Dave Zhou is wearing: a Supreme
x Louis Vuitton parka (easily $10,000), Nike Air
Yeezy 2’s ($2,500 on a good day), and a BAPE hoodie
and designer jeans for good measure. If you were
to paper your body with $100 dollar bills—$18,400
or so—you’d barely have enough money to buy the
clothes off his back.
Zhou is manning a table of what he calls “his product”—stacks
of BAPE hoodies that, combined, must
be worth over $10,000—at Sneakergreet Boston.
Self-described as the “dopest sneaker event in Boston,” Sneakergreet descends upon a Holiday Inn in
east Somerville on Feb. 3rd. It promises a raffle—
the grand prize: $1,000 in a Supreme backpack—along
with a space for sneaker and streetwear enthusiasts
to buy, sell, and trade their (often high-priced) goods,
ranging from Yeezys and Jordans to Supreme hoodies
and Versace loafers.
Rick Ross and Migos blare from speakers as gangly
pre-teens and middle-aged fathers inspect one other’s
outfits, examine sneakers for defects, and haggle
over prices. A man wanders around peddling a pair of
Yeezy Powerphases. “$120, size 10,” he intones.
Yet beyond this bazaar of street culture and fashion,
Sneakergreet and its attendees offer a unique way
to discuss streetwear’s inherent contradiction: the
conflict between the creative spirit it preaches and the
avaricious, deeply consumerist attitude evident in its
price tags and many of its disciples.
***
Streetwear is ostensibly a fashion style, emerging
from the beaches of San Diego and Los Angeles, and
from the streets of New York and Shibuya; out of skater
and surfer culture, and out of hip-hop and basketball.
Those are only a few of its influences: Streetwear
has its origins in disparate places, whether that be
haute couture, Americana, or cyberpunk. This hybrid
forms what designer Virgil Abloh called in a 2017 interview
“a sort of camaraderie, a sort of collective, a
community” that extends past fashion—an art form
that embodies what it is to be “creative in limited
means.” A neon red long-sleeve hangs behind Abloh in
his interview. It reads “post-post modern.”
This interdisciplinary spirit is alive and well at
Sneakergreet: Past the tables lined with Yeezys, Jordans,
and price tags, several streetwear startups
are selling not just their branded apparel, but their
own brand ethos. Eli T. Mook describes his “lifestyle
brand” Hundo Life as embodying the “need to represent
yourself 100%, keep it real at all times.”
“We do more than clothes,” he says. “We do music,
we host events, we just building, man. That’s what
we’re here to do.”
For Haven Prescott Jr., streetwear aims to “bring
like-minded individuals together, whether that’s
[through] art, music, or fashion.” He cites a collaboration
between his brand, Syndicate, and an Italian olive
oil company—selling bottles of oil at $200 a pop—
as an example of the brand “unifying the culture.”
And what is this culture? “Streetwear culture, it
doesn’t matter what it is.” He smiles, and offers me a
business card.
***
From the least dismissive perspective, streetwear
can be seen as embodying an odd mix of irony and sincerity.
It’s relentless: Supreme releases t-shirts with
“Fuck You We Do What We Want” emblazoned on
the front; BAPE announces a new partnership with
Spongebob or the Minions; or Balenciaga releases a
Bernie Sanders-inspired “Berncore” collection, walking
models in $400-t-shirts across the runway. It’s all
a big joke and absolutely serious at the same time. It’s
infuriating.
If you buy into this artistic view of streetwear
as transgressive commentary, making Ezra Pound’s
modernist command to “make it new” into something
new itself, then maybe all of these staggeringly expensive
clothes and shoes are necessary evils. Maybe
that’s the point. Maybe.
But there’s another perspective: Prescott denounces
those who “want to run around wearing what everyone
else is wearing”—the people he dismisses as
“robots” and “hypebeasts”.
There’s certainly a vein of exhibitionism at Sneakergreet.
Alex J. Drinkwater is wearing a Supreme box
logo hoodie swimming in stars and stripes, along with
another pair of Nike Air Yeezys, worth only $1,000 or
so. He’s chosen his outfit simply to “flex on everyone
else,” he says, spreading his arms and smirking. He
unabashedly declares his favorite brands are “mainly
the hype [ones]—call me a hypebeast, whatever you
want, I don’t care. It is what it is.”
He’s there to “sell and collect,” and so is Dave
Zhou. He wants “to sell all [his] Bapes, try and make
some money,” he says. Someone interrupts to ask how
much the BAPE facemasks—flimsy cotton with sharktoothed
mouths printed on—go for. “$80. Cash,” he
says. These facemasks, along the iconic hoodies, he
bought by the suitcase-load in Japan for hungry
American consumers who will pay well above the
Japanese retail price.
Scott M. Smaller is another vendor at the event,
dwarfed by the selection of Gatorade-blue-tinted
Yeezy Boosts he’s selling. His toddler son sprawls next
to him, sporting infant-sized Yeezys and a confused
expression. Smaller has packed his table with Adidas
not because it’s his favorite brand, he says, but
because “that’s what other people’s favorite brand
is currently. That’s why I have it, so that I can make
some money.”
Funnily enough, even Abloh, champion of streetwear
as an art movement for our age, understands
that “all these words that I’m saying, you can take
these words and put them into a product.”
But who’s saying streetwear can only be one or
the other? Does its move to the mainstream, its constant
self-commodification necessarily compromise
its own artistic ambitions? To Edgar Arty, organizer
of Sneakergreet, the event should be “more than just
opening the doors and taking money and collecting
from the tables—I think there should be an entertainment
aspect to it.”
Abloh himself says streetwear is not “limited
or degraded by this youth obsession with a box logo
t-shirt.” Instead, he says, “It’s a way of thinking, [and]
there’s new roads to be made in that, and we’re at the
cusp of it. We’re only like five years deep.”
***
Krista L. Lawrence is one of many moms at Sneakergreet,
accompanying her two sons. She sits behind
their table, looking bewildered and resigned all at
once. It’s hard to hear her through the obscene Young
Thug lyrics emanating from the DJ’s booth. He keeps
interrupting to shout about Timberlands, while a
cluster of pre-teens vapes furtively in the far corner
of the room.
I have to ask: What does she think about all this?
She surveys the room. “I personally think it’s crazy,
but to each their own,” she says. Her smile is either
exasperated or patient, it’s hard to tell. “Other people
spend their money on jewelry or drugs—I’d rather
have my kids spending it on something they enjoy.”
I ask her 14-year old son, Kyle W. Lawrence, why
he collects sneakers.
“I—” He pauses, looks down at his customized Adidas
NMDs. “I honestly don’t know. I like it.”

I awoke in my grandfather’s house at sunrise each morning to the sound of migrant workers building houses, three to nine stories tall, 1000 miles away from their families.
It had been seven years since I last returned to the two Fujianese villages my family comes from. Villages in this region are organized by last name; the Wus live a twenty minute walk away from the Shis.
Life here felt familiar. Everyone referred to me as my father’s daughter or my mother’s daughter and recalled how they held me when I was yea tall. The indigo toilet that scared me as a child still sat sturdy in the bathroom where the showerhead hangs two feet away from the sink. Less familiar were the newly erected mansions.
On morning strolls, my gaze fell on the mountains where my father once searched for kindling and on the monstrous houses that punctuate the cabbage patches. I mistook the mansions for apartment buildings. That each belonged to a single family surprised me; that many remained empty, even more.
Grandfather pointed to the six stories of pale pink tile towering over us, the emerald accents a reminder of the nearby sea. “Paraguay,” he said, referring to where the owners live. The importance of laojia—one’s old home—means that people send back money to build these mansions, even if they never plan to live in them. Many of the houses lining my great-aunt’s street are empty or inhabited by grandparents and grandchildren as the parents work 14-hour days at Chinese restaurants abroad.
My great-aunt’s son left some years ago, after their family paid a handsome sum to snakeheads for his passage. That those smuggled sometimes drown or suffocate did not dissuade him from leaving.
He never made it to Spain. “He’s missing,” my mother told me. I didn’t dare ask my great-aunt if she still thought her son was out there, somewhere.
During the late 20th century, a mass exodus of Fujianese men resulted in monthly remittances worth years of wages back home. In order to pay off tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and to support their families who stayed behind, these men lived in private squalor. If all went as planned, they reunited with their children and wives after several years apart. The lucky ones built mansions.
Their grand manors became symbols of the American Dream, of a luxury foreign to those born in an era when boiled eggs were saved for birthday meals. Though Chinese immigrants have footed most of the construction bills in our villages, some of the newer mansions have been built by local entrepreneurs who benefited from the nation’s economic growth. Now that there is money to be made in China, fewer people embark on these journeys.
On my last day in my father’s village, as I followed the winding road past neighbors tending to their fields, a lightness lifted my spirits. I saw the mountains ahead and the mansions below, reduced to empty concrete structures only animated during lunar new year when people surrender to the inescapable pull of their roots. I also saw my grandfather at the other end, waiting for me to come home for dinner.
A few months before my trip to Fujian, I found myself in Brooklyn at the doorsteps of a distant uncle I had never met before. I wanted to retrace the factory lines that render family time scarce, the slow hours at a restaurant where boredom is relief, the tender gestures that shelter children from the hardships parents endure. This uncle, who had immigrated to the United States two decades ago, granted me entry into a world to which I no longer belonged.
We walked through the rain that Saturday evening to visit a friend in an unassuming brown building. Inside, ten mid-aged women sewed pre-cut cloth into mounting piles of black shirts with baubles.
The furrowed brows of the one man in the room, who ironed sheet after sheet with his calloused hands, reminded me of my father during our early years in Canada. Yet this man, despite years of toil, had not left the working conditions of harsh fluorescent lights. My parents had. Standing in that sweatshop, my inherited immigrant narrative no longer felt universal.
As the first in his village to attend university, my father brought us on an adventure that was legal but not leisurely; Canada at the time welcomed skilled workers. Upon arrival, my parents, horrified that I might be underfed, splurged on a handful of shrimp. They cooked two for my bowl each meal and rationed themselves to the cheapest vegetables. Years later, the same job offer that freed us from decrepit rentals also forced a farewell to our beloved neighbors.
When we left Toronto’s Chinatown for a white city in Southwestern Ontario, I implored my parents to not pack rice and leftover stir-fry in my lunchbag, so that I could disappear in this world where I would come to love my friends’ parents but often feel too ashamed to bring friends into our home of broken English. How quickly a childhood of deracinating passes, and how comforting yet confusing it is to now embrace all that I had shunned.
In New York City’s Chinatown, I sought the loudness of Fuzhou dialect, determined to share peanut noodles and taro cakes with my Jewish boyfriend. There is an easy intimacy to be found in these restaurants—many of which contain lives that know only the paths between their wok stations and their shared bedrooms. Upon identifying me as one of their own, the restaurant staff extend their camaraderie. I eagerly accept to the extent that I can.

Of all post-structural feminist queer-and-gender-andfilm-aesthetics
theorists, Patricia MacCormack is without
a doubt my hands-down favorite.
Hailed by Rosi Braidotti of Utrecht University as
“the ultimate third millennium sexual radical”—as if
there’s any other kind—MacCormack is the author of
such groundbreaking literature as “The Queer Ethics of
Monstrosity” and “Becoming-Vulva: Flesh, Fold, Infinity.”
She currently holds the position of professor of
Continental Philosophy in English and Media at Anglia
Ruskin University, Cambridge, where she conducts
research in European horror film, animal studies, and
post-human theory (I totally know what this means…).
More importantly, however, MacCormack is the
daring intellect behind perhaps the most important
philosophical unearthing of the 21st century.
Something she has designated—wait for it—cinesexuality.
Yes, you read that right.
And yes, that is a portmanteau of cinema and sexuality.
And yes, I firmly intend to write the next 900 words
about it.
I first came across MacCormack’s aptly named treatise
on the matter, Cinesexuality, last spring during my
Expository Writing course. (Please, don’t ask). I developed
an immediate obsession. The first time I tried
explaining her theory—to friends over diner, admittedly
not the best choice—the operative word was misheard as
‘cinnamon-sexuality.’ To this day, the red powdery stuff
doesn’t taste quite the same.
Once the jargon was hammered out, we turned to the
text and began, as is proper, with Chapter 1: “Cinesexuality
is the desire which flows through all who want
cinema as a lover. It knows no gender, no sexuality, no
form, and no function.” Damn, Patricia. Damn.
My friends and I had a good laugh. They thought it
ridiculous, and I can see why: with chapters titled “Cinemasochism”
and “Zombies without Organs,” the buy-in
was remarkably high, and her claims seemingly caught
up in their own cinematic grandeur. I finished the book,
all 149 pages, and still hadn’t a clue as to what it all meant.
Cinesexuality? Absurd.
Completely and totally absurd.

The showing was particularly late: 11 p.m., and a
35-minute drive north. Nothing my rising-college-sophomore
self couldn’t handle, I told my mom, using that
deep earnest voice I use when attempting masculine
self-assurance. Begrudgingly—after a stern but kind runthrough
of basic road safety—she relented. I waited in
sweaty-palmed anticipation the rest of the day, urging
with every other thought the sun to set, and to hurry up
with it!
I had places to be. People not to meet. A movie to see.
Afire with anticipation, I fished out from under a
stack of Vanity Fairs and Condé Nasts the then-fouryear-old
“100 Greatest Films of All Time” edition of
Entertainment Weekly. What was left of it, at least. The
cover had long since torn off, and the thing was held
together only by my clumsy taping. Magazines of that
thin filmy paper weren’t meant to last this long.
I flipped, as I had done so many times before, to
roughly one-third of the way through, and, beginning
with #1, scrolled down the list. Citizen Kane, The Godfather,
Casablanca… until finally I arrived at #15. Blue
Velvet. The description was tantalizingly brief, and read
in part: “Lynch’s masterpiece of erotic obsession is a hallucinatory
thriller that turns into a surrealist nightmare.”
Chills.
Since the fateful 2013 summer day when that glossyfresh
publication first graced our family mailbox, I had
been desperate to see Blue Velvet. And at long last, at
an unquestionably qualified-to-see-films-with-sexualcontent
19-years-old, I was on the verge of fulfilling that
fantasy four years in the making.
It was a weeknight and the roads were empty. The
few cars that had ventured out were trundling along
much, much too slowly, seemingly oblivious to my need
for speed. But soon enough, having hurled enough profanity
at my steering wheel to rival the saltiest of sailors,
I arrived.
The theater was lush, the dim lobby low-ceilinged
and draped sensually in a deep burgundy velvet. I had
seen movies here before, but never at this hour. Afraid to
speak, I walked in reverent silence to my seat.
The movie began, and for the first time in my young
life, I watched alone: the seats beside me remained
folded upwards, no insolent rear having forced them
perpendicular. Distant shadows flickered in my periphery,
silhouettes suggestive of couples munching popcorn
and whispering in confusion as this strange, strange film
unfolded.
“What do they think of me?” I wondered. I wouldn’t
go so far as saying that seeing movies solo is a societal
taboo, but… I couldn’t shake the suspicion that the
audience, conscious of my solitude, was watching me.
Watching me watching this film. Watching me watching
Kyle MacLachlan’s Jeffrey watching through a closet
door Isabella Rossellini’s Dorothy looking tenderly at a
photograph of her captive son. This infinite regress was
thrilling, in its own voyeuristic sort of way.
But soon I forgot the others and let the film suck me
in. And suck me in it did. Into a perverse world of deadly
joyrides, of doppelgängers and severed ears, where
logic was color and time tripped by only as fast as the
jarring Shostakovich-inspired soundtrack. The barrage
of image and sound was relentless, pounding against my
eyes, my ears, my brain, unceasing…
And suddenly it was over. The house-lights slowly
filled the theater with an unreal glow.
The drive home was death-quiet—I had turned the
radio off, fearful that an errant chord would harsh the
near-sacred ambiance cultivated over the last few hours.
The streetlights smeared by, painting my retinas.
***
“[A]s all cinesexuals know, cinema brings to us the
unbearable excesses of the simplest planes within an
image,” MacCormack writes, and I cannot help but feel
a resonance, echoes of Blue Velvet breaking back into
consciousness.
Sitting alone in a movie theater is liberating. There is
no need to perform: to laugh when your family laughs,
to cry when your friends cry, to feel the obligation
of squeezing your boyfriend’s hand as the murderer
approaches yet another unwitting victim. Instead, you
are called to honesty. To respond to this work of art as
you, and no one else. And isn’t this what sex is? Openness
to experience, and the vulnerability of being laid
bare.
I like seeing movies.
But I love seeing them alone.
So if you’re contemplating asking me out (as is only
inevitable), a movie isn’t a bad idea. I won’t say no.
But consider leaving an empty seat in between.

During his 20 year presidency of Harvard College, things did not always sit well with Derek C. Bok.
“It was just uncomfortable… I don’t know how to describe it,” Bok says. “I’d have to think for a while before I could put it into words.” Bok is describing the Holyoke Chair, an approximately 450-year-old relic that has been a symbol of Harvard’s presidency since the 18th century. Aside from its much-needed cushion that Bok’s own mother embroidered for him during his time as president, the chair is one of the only artifacts stored in the Fogg Museum that periodically leaves the museum to be put to use.
As Bok and other presidents of Harvard College have noted (rather unfondly), the chair is famously uncomfortable and prone to tipping over, owing to its ribbed wooden dowels and its bizarre 3-legged construction. To this day, the chair’s unconventional design creates a rather harrowing sitting experience for the university president during long, drawn-out ceremonies, from Inaugurations to Commencements. Indeed, were it not for the addition of a stabilizing fin at the back of the chair in recent decades, the chair may have contributed to quite a spectacle. One 1992 letter from Ivan Gaskell, Professor of Cultural History at the Bard Graduate Center, imagines the worst: “I am sure that our present president is a delicate sitter, but one never knows what calamity might occur if the chair were ever used without the stabilizing ‘fin’.”
The origins of the chair and how it made its way to Harvard are hazy. The chair is estimated to have been lathe-turned sometime in the 1500s and is constructed of European Ash, leading to speculation that the chair is English or Welsh in origin.
Despite contemporary critiques of its sitting quality, chairs of similar construction to the Holyoke Chair were all the rage in their heyday. “In the 17th century world, there aren’t many options. It’s not like there’s a couch you can choose,” explains Ethan Lasser, Curator of American Art at Harvard Art Museums. “This is actually the most comfortable chair in the orbit of British furniture circa 1660.”
Even as this style of chair grew out of style in the mid- to late-1700s, its then-La-Z-Boy caliber of comfort (to use Lasser’s comparison) was coveted by Europe’s wealthiest. Antiquarian Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, describes in a fervent 1775 letter to the Countess of Ossory that he “crammed [his] cloister with three cart-loads of lumbering chairs from Mr. Bateman’s, and at last [is] surfeited with the immovable movables of our forefathers.”
Across the pond, Harvard’s presidency had its own little obsession with European patriarchy, developing the habit of appropriating Medieval English artifacts as its own. Increase Mather was one of the first presidents to take on this trend, bringing a London-constructed telescope back to Harvard in 1692 after a four-year excursion to England. One theory suggests that the Mather family was entrenched through marriage in a dense web of wealthy English dignitaries, including Massachusetts Governor Thomas Pownall, a personal friend of chair-enthusiast Walpole.
However it ended up at Harvard, the Holyoke Chair is so named because it captured the eye of president and avid anglophile Edward Holyoke in the early 1700s. Holyoke saw ownership of the chair as an opportunity to legitimize Harvard’s name against a crop of time-honored English institutions like Oxford and Cambridge. At the time, he may have considered even the act of “sitting” proper to be uniquely aristocratic. “There wasn’t much seating furniture around, particularly in rural England,” Lasser says. “It was probably made for the patriarch of a family; he would have been in this chair, and everyone else would have been in stools or benches.” It is speculated that the modern-day administrative position of “chair”—say, for instance, the Chair of Fifteen Minutes Magazine—is derived from this tradition.
The chair became somewhat of a pet project for Holyoke, as evidenced by its pommels—the only feature of the chair other than the stabilizing fin to be composed of wood that is non-native to the European continent—which were turned out of American oak by Holyoke himself. Holyoke insisted on becoming the first in a long line of Harvard presidents to have an oil portrait painted of him while sitting in the chair.
The connection between Holyoke’s usage of the chair and the chair’s role in the present day is not well documented. Several sources suggest the chair may have landed in students’ hands sometime during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is then that the chair became the stuff of legend—a subject of mystery, jest, and at times, poetry.
When the chair was housed in Harvard Hall in the 1800s, for example, it is said to have been used for unsavory purposes: it granted male sitters the right to kiss any woman he was showing around the college. Timothy Bigelow (class of 1886) delivered an 1811 poetic oration to Phi Beta Kappa that tells it exactly as it was: “Now young gallants allure their favorite fair to take a seat in Presidential chair; Then seize the long accustomed fee, the bliss of the half ravished, half free-granted kiss.”
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (class of 1861), who would later go on to become an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, took interest in the chair’s cryptic origins during his undergraduate years at Harvard, crafting an elaborate creation myth in which one student—the mononymous “Smith”—would pass the chair from generation to generation for all eternity. “These are the terms, as we are told saide Smith said chaire to have and holde,” Holmes wrote. “When he doth graduate, then to passe to ye oldest youth in ye Senior Classe… and soe forever.” Smith was never heard from again.
Though the chair’s course through Harvard’s history is vacuous at best, its role in Harvard’s presidential tradition is iconic today. In addition to being used in public ceremonies, the Holyoke Chair has become a symbolic gesture of the presidency’s rich past.
As it turns out, Derek C. Bok, after enduring 20 years in the chair, was not actually shown sitting in the chair in his Holyoke-style oil portrait. “The reason was because I painted Derek Bok after he had stepped down as president,” says Jason Bouldin ’89, the artist who immortalized Bok on canvas. Instead, the chair is shown in the background—an inert, triangular decoration—while Bok is seen blissfully lounging in a cushy, four-legged wooden seat. “It was sort of a way to show that the chair and the robes… are sort of these emblems of state. I just thought it would be a nice way to say that he stepped aside for the next president.”
Laurel T. Ulrich has emphasized the chair’s significance in more recent years. Ulrich, the professor of a general education course that features a study of the Holyoke Chair, remembers curating a 2011 exhibit featuring the chair. “One of the devices we used—which was a lot of fun—was to misplace things.” Ulrich took the rare opportunity to place the chair in the Schlesinger Library next to the portrait of current President Drew G. Faust, along with a pair of embroidered slippers that once belonged to a former male president of Radcliffe College. “It was just a little comment on the transformation of the possibility of a woman [becoming president]. We were making a historical observation.”
When Faust leaves her historic 10-year tenure as the first woman president of Harvard College in June 2018, all eyes will be on Lawrence S. Bacow as he takes his first seat in the presidential chair.

Hey guys, we’re all friends here. Especially now that you’ve all seen the sleekly outlined contours of my body in this latex bodysuit that I, somehow wrongly, felt was appropriate to wear to Adult Night at Legoland Discovery Center Boston. I assumed we were all here for the same reason—to capital-D Discover the power of sensual touch against the backdrop of thousands of tiny plastic bricks. And naturally, we’re all aware of the excruciatingly uncomfortable sensation of a naked foot on those eight raised plastic nipply bits on the classic two by four Lego—and we have naturally all imagined that exact same sensation on significantly more sensitive parts of the body.
Folks. It’s between 7 and 9 p.m. on a Wednesday evening, it’s 2018, the theme is “I <3 Olympics” and we all know that none of us have kids waiting at home. I am frankly baffled that none of you correctly interpreted the implication of this event. I will admit, I was just notified that a neck-high black latex bodysuit complete with coordinating whip holster “does not conform to Legoland Boston’s Code of Conduct.” While I would normally agree, I have to reemphasize that this is Adult Night. In this two-hour window on a weekday night, interested adults who have no kids of their own are not limited to exploring Legoland’s 12 attractions. Interested adults with no kids of their own can also explore their own attractions.
And sure. The Facebook event didn’t say “no kids allowed,” but it did promise a cash bar for 21+ patrons. Kids can use neither cash nor bars. The evidence is very clear, and I’m not sure where you all went wrong.

Master Yon G. Lee, Harvard’s chief instructor of kung fu and tai chi, draws an old sword from a leather hilt. Turning around, he hands me the weapon. Half a dozen other students look on.
Lee, who turns 70 next month, is a short, slender man with thin silver hair. He wears a white crewneck sweatshirt advertising the Harvard Tai Chi Tiger Crane Club, which he has advised for over a decade.
The sword is heavy and sharp. It cuts through a cardboard box like butter. He has me practice a few simple motions, and then asks me to stab him in the throat.
“Excuse me?” I reply.
Lee takes the point of the sword and places the metal on the fleshy area just above his collarbone. I stand frozen, white-knuckling the hilt, not putting an ounce of force into the blade. Lee complains I am not stabbing him hard enough. He calls over Michael R. Showstack, a tough Bostonian who has run a kung fu school for more than a decade. Showstack grabs my arms and shoves down impossibly hard.
Lee’s face narrows in intense concentration. The sword bows downward, buckling under the sudden force of Showstack’s push. Everything happens too fast. Seconds later, Showstack relents. The sword drops away.
Lee is perfectly fine. A deep indentation appears in his neck, but no blood. He explains that he directed his “chi”—energy he believes permeates every living thing—to his neck, which protected him from the blade. Lee moves on as if nothing happened.
I stare at my hands and touch the tip of the sword to assure myself it’s real. My stomach feels wobbly and nauseous. Guilty and exhilarated, I think I understand what it was like for an audience member to saw Harry Houdini in half. And like that volunteer, I have no idea how to explain what’s going on.

A few feet away from us, a class of about 30 people listen to a lecture about qigong, a traditional Chinese healing method. We’re in the office of Lee’s acupuncturist (called the Oriental Culture Institute), who allows Lee to use the space on Sundays to practice with his most advanced students. It makes for a strange environment, but Lee’s intense demonstrations barely raise eyebrows.
Lee and his students refer to each other as a kung fu family. They come from radically different walks of life, from Harvard and from Chinatown, from the suburbs and from Southie. While I am baffled by this world where swords glance off skin, they laugh and take it in stride. Lee pulls the strange threads of this family together. His friends include the faculty deans of Adams House and former mayor of Boston Raymond L. Flynn, who worked with Lee to purge criminal gangs from Chinatown in the early nineties.
Some say Lee—tai chi master, Harvard fixture, sword-repeller—can even cure broken bones.
***
Timothy J. Lavallee, a student of martial arts who has known Lee for ten years, picked me up around 9:30 a.m. that morning. Lavallee practices with Lee every Sunday and volunteered to drive me from Cambridge to Quincy, Mass., where the Institute is located. He has short white hair and a small stud in his left earlobe. He was listening to Wu-Tang Clan when he picked me up, but turned it off so we could talk. There was an animal jawbone in the backseat of his car, but I didn’t bring it up.
At around 10 a.m., we arrived at a slablike brick office building with a mediocre burger joint on its ground floor. We took a shaky elevator up to the fifth floor, where we were greeted by a view of Quincy’s church steeples and colonial brick.
The Institute comprises a large central room with a few closed doors at the margins. The open space has the unresolved quality of a “Where’s Waldo?” picture. Several ceiling panels are missing. What appear to be small camera lenses are glued to every surface in the area, including on a snowglobe containing the Buddha. “Shhhhh…. Live Guinea Pig Class In Progress,” declare several homemade signs. I see no trace of any guinea pigs.
At the entrance, next to a wooden folding screen, stands a massive yellow M & M character. It’s holding a large tray above its head, filled with smaller statues of M & Ms. In fact, the room is filled with M & M paraphernalia. Paper cups lie throughout the room, filled with M & Ms. One smaller red M & M is dressed like Elvis Presley.

Between the unseen-but-oft-alluded-to guinea pigs and the truly unfathomable volume of M & Ms, Lavallee warmed up for the tai chi lesson. As he made the signature smooth, slow movements of the practice, I sat in a leather chair off to the side to wait for Lee. A tall man walked over to me from the qigong lecture on the other end of the room. He wordlessly handed me a large oyster shell with a camera lens and five magnets glued to the swirling mother-of-pearl inside. He motioned for me to put it on my stomach and also placed a heavy board laden with magnets under my foot. Then he walked away. I sat like this for several minutes before I quietly placed the objects back on the table.
Lee arrived 30 minutes late, but nonetheless walked in with an assured air that informed us we were, in fact, early. Yet there wasn’t a drop of arrogance in him. He is like a force of nature in that way—the rain falls when it falls and Lee arrives when he arrives. He moves through the world unlike anyone I have ever met. I would later learn Lee describes most major events in his life as a result of being in “the right place at the right time.”
Lee has no agenda, though he does have things he would like to teach. He apologized to us for the delay, his voice never rising above a whisper.

Lee was born in Taishan City, China in 1948. He converted to Christianity after attending missionary schools in Hong Kong. At the start of the Great Leap Forward, when Lee was 10, he moved to Boston. His father had already lived there for some time, working as an electrician in the Quincy shipyards during World War II and operating a laundromat for 20 years after that.
After attending English High School, Lee enrolled at Brandeis as a physics major. As an undergraduate, he co-authored a 1970 paper on laser diffraction in the American Journal of Physics. He studied abroad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where his life path began to shift.
Yon Lee returned to Hong Kong around the same time Bruce Lee did. Bruce Lee’s movies shattered box office records across Asia in the early 70s; and Yon, like the rest, was a fan. But what drew him most deeply to kung fu—a blanket term for the art of controlling chi—were not cinematic kicks or punches. He was fascinated by the parallel practice of qigong, which uses controlled chi for healing, rather than violence. While he studied in Hong Kong, he noticed how the poor in the city and in southern China turned to acupuncture for medicine, given it was sometimes the only treatment they could afford.
Lee returned to Boston and completed his Masters degree in nuclear physics at Northeastern. After graduating in 1974, he devoted himself to what caught his interest most while studying abroad: kung fu. He has taught ever since, using his education in physics to explain the complex motions behind tai chi and qigong. “I try to demystify it,” Lee says. “There’s really a lot of science behind it.”
When he wasn’t teaching kung fu, Lee began a career in politics. Relations between the U.S. and China were warming for the first time in decades. Lee had studied abroad during Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China, making him a hot commodity in the states—an interpreter of the newly open country. “It was just a simple trip, and that sort of made me into an expert,” Lee says, laughing. “I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.”
Lee was friendly with Edward J. King, a candidate for Massachusetts governor. After King was elected in 1978, he appointed Lee an adviser on China, where Lee worked to establish relations between Massachusetts and the Chinese government.
In the 1980s, Lee had a brief stint running Hung’s Food, an egg roll factory in Brighton, Mass. owned by his family. Somehow, balancing Hung’s and his usual teaching schedule, he found time to start coaching kung fu at Harvard.
Throughout, Lee says he never lost sight of the original reason he learned kung fu: to heal the people around him. In 1987, Lee was appointed Mayor's Liaison to the Chinese Community (yet another position Lee attributes to “being in the right place at the right time”). In the 80s, parts of Chinatown were colloquially known as the “Combat Zone,” controlled by the Triads, an organized crime syndicate. By the time of Lee’s appointment, the area had built a reputation for violence. The Harvard community in particular was shocked in 1976 when football player Andrew Puopolo ’77 was stabbed to death in Chinatown after that year’s Harvard-Yale game.
“I wanted to get rid of those peep shops and burlesque shows and prostitution and drugs,” says Flynn, then-mayor of Boston, who cold-called me to talk about Lee. “So I brought Yon in and we we went full speed ahead to clean up the Combat Zone down there by Chinatown.”
On Jan. 12, 1991, during Lee’s tenure as liaison, five men were murdered in a gambling parlor on Tyler Street. After the mayor left the crime scene, it was Lee’s job to go on television and tell the public not to panic. Afterward, squad cars circled Lee’s home for protection, given he was now the face of gangbusting.
“It was never part of the job description that I would be on the front line,” Lee says. He had hoped to be a more low-profile community advocate.
Flynn calls Lee’s overall tenure was an unqualified success. Lee advocated for bilingual education and special-needs programs in Chinatown schools and fought for affordable housing, all of which undermined the Triads’ stranglehold on the neighborhood. He helped William J. Bratton, then Superintendent-in-Chief of the Boston Police Department, develop a new community policing policy in the area. Lee was instrumental in getting roughly a dozen Asian police officers appointed to the force.
“We met a lot of opposition from a lot of prominent mobsters, bookies, gangsters and the underworld,” says Flynn. “Yon made great progress. He never got much credit for it.”

Lee and I eat dinner together in Adams House, where he has been an associate since 1997. When he taps through his iPad to show me videos of his students, he does so with the same careful motions he uses in his tai chi. We’re joined by Marilyn M. Goodrich and Jaden Y. Freeze ’19, two regular attendees at Lee’s tai chi sessions. Both were drawn into Lee’s circle by word of mouth and by what they call his magnetic presence.
Goodrich has a soft voice and and short gray hair covered by a knitted cap. She is a retired administrative coordinator in the Anthropology department, and has been coming to Lee’s classes since 2010. She says she had been falling a lot before she began, so friends recommended she pick up tai chi.
“It’s hard to describe it, but it just became a way of life for me with the tai chi, where I just felt stronger as a person,”Goodrich says. “I felt less overwhelmed.”
Goodrich says she doesn’t fall anymore.
“People were regaling me with the different wonderful feats he’s done in the past, which I certainly believe now,” says Freeze, who has been attending Lee’s classes for a semester or so.
Freeze, a Chemistry and Physics concentrator, says he appreciates the way Lee uses science as a metaphor to explain tai chi. When I tell Lee I study physics, he begins to explain chi in terms of resistance and capacitance.
Students from past years also lauded Lee’s teachings. “[Tai chi] helped me improve in my ability to deal with asthma at the time,” recalls Andrew J. Green ’99, who now works at a think tank in Washington, D.C. “It grounds you when you do it in a serious way. It takes you out of the day-to-day things you worry about.” The dozen other students I spoke with shared similar praise for Lee.
To Lee and many of his followers, the control of chi through kung fu has a deep healing power. The tai chi and qigong they practice means much more than the simple motions that appear on the surface. It’s a mistake to clump the practices under the umbrella of the secular “mindfulness movement.” What Lee does is not corporate yoga, squeegeed of cultural and spiritual significance and sanitized for a skeptical Western audience. This is not just exercise. Tai chi is a religious practice.
Not only does kung fu have spiritual significance, it is supposed to yield tangible results. Showstack, the gruff Bostonian who drove the sword into Lee’s throat, tells me Lee’s qigong treatments helped his 14-year-old son heal from a serious injury. Showstack’s son’s growth plate had fractured in a gruesome car accident, and doctors weren’t sure his leg would grow. Showstack attributes his son’s full recovery to Lee’s intervention.
Lee is constantly doing experiments to test the limits of qigong. Right now he’s interested in storing chi, taking his body’s energy and transferring it into large bins of dried soybeans. He says these beans can be used to heal people, just like his hands can transfer energy to patients. Pulling out his iPad, Lee shows me a video of an inconsolable child who stops crying when plopped into an enormous container of beans.
“It’s an energy that’s completely untapped,” says Bill E. Emmes, one of Lee’s students and collaborators on the bean tests. “It’s a way of life that has existed outside the United States for centuries, and people here scoff at it.”
I have trouble believing these claims. Lee’s practices transgress my comfortable division between religion and science. I like to confine the mystic to one hour on church Sundays, where it won’t interfere with a carefully constructed world of science and observation.
I call Peter M. Wayne, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, to get his opinion. Wayne has practiced qigong and tai chi for over 40 years, learning traditional Chinese medicine while he mastered cutting-edge biochemistry.
“There are people who have accumulated skills through traditional training who have information that’s worth exploring,”Wayne says. “We shouldn’t coo-coo these things. Just because we can’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s not worth exploring.”
Wayne explains how these practices work. Tai chi is effective in preventing older people from falling—not only because it strengthens the legs and increases flexibility, but also because it heightens attention, Wayne says. As people practice tai chi, they become more aware of their body in space and less vulnerable to lapses of control, he adds.
It was less clear to me how the qigong treatments—which resemble normal massages—could work, but they might also have a biological mechanism: biofields. Wayne explains that the human body produces electric and magnetic fields measurable through EEGs and MRIs. Perhaps, Wayne suggests, people could manipulate their fields to change those of others. He is careful to clarify there is no convincing evidence either way at this time.
As for the beans, Wayne links it to the long tradition of homeopathy, but is not dismissive. “I think the jury hasn’t even been assembled, much less being out,” he says.
***
Lee never married, but he is a part of a warm kung fu family. His students praise his unusual approach to teaching, which mimics his gentle go-with-the-flow path through life. “He sort of lets things go, until you get to a certain point where you look like you’ve figured it out, and then he’ll offer advice,” Showstack says. “It’s a different way of teaching.”

“He let me discover [qigong] myself,” says W. Vincent Rocha, a student of Showstack and Lee who has been practicing martial arts for almost 30 years. “You kind of teach yourself by watching how he responds to it.”
“Master Lee is very giving,” says Deb A. Sukeforth, another student at the Sunday session. “He will share, share anything you want, you know. And try to help you understand it.”
People never seem to remember exactly how Lee came into their lives. He simply became visible, like a flower exposed by melting snow. Robert J. Kiely, who served as master of Adams House when Lee first became affiliated with Harvard, says Lee just “appeared” and offered to teach tai chi to Adams House residents.
“He’s a character, the way we are all characters, but he just brings extraordinary depth and breadth to undergraduate houses,” says John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, one of the current faculty deans of Adams House. “What we’re trying to build is that diversity of personality and opinion and knowledge.”
***
Lee has a unique worldview, which he describes as simultaneously Christian, Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian, all steeped in tai chi. Though he is devout in each of these traditions, Lee does not believe they are in conflict.
“They’re all basic principles of being, helping one another, and being benevolent and compassionate,”Lee says. The “concepts” and “methods” are different, he explains, but they share the same real-world practice.
Lee’s take on these traditions undermines the power structures of the everyday. The meek inherit the earth, the poor barefoot doctor cures the country with only a box of needles, and the nonviolent win the street fight. Is it fantasy to think injustice can be undone by belief? When I’m with Lee, I sense something very real here—a subtle, slow-moving current of good flowing deep below the surface of our world.
He taught me that to defend myself, all I had to do was twist my arms and send the shock of a punch back into the person who threw it. Forces of violence, like a physical strike or the troubles that paralyzed Chinatown for years, could be matched by a small twist. To Lee, affordable housing and kung fu are two sides of the same coin.
His philosophy is a quiet one. He’s not a prophet, and he has no ambitions to change the world. “Now that I’m semi-retired, I just do whatever I want,” he says. “No particular aim.” He spends his time with friends, shaping the world he has into one with a bit more compassion and wonder.
A few days ago, I sent a simple email to Lee, asking about his day-to-day life.
He replied with a short manifesto: “I practice my tai chi and spend my days and nights dreaming and mimicking Nature in infinite ways imaginable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School’s capital campaign reached its $750 million goal earlier this month, administrators announced Wednesday.
The campaign, titled “The World Is Waiting: The Campaign for Harvard Medicine,” was publicly launched in Nov. 2014 after the school had already raised about $375 million during the “quiet phase” of their efforts. The campaign has the third-largest goal across all of the University’s 12 schools, trailing only targets set by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Business School.
Lisa Boudreau, dean for alumni affairs and development at the Medical School, announced the achievement of the goal in an emailed statement Wednesday.
“We are enormously grateful to the many supporters who have embraced our mission and who are investing in the lifesaving work of HMS,” Boudreau wrote.
The school reached the $750-million mark on Feb. 6 but did not publicly announce the state of the campaign until Wednesday evening. The school’s campaign will continue until the end of June.
The campaign focuses on four core causes: Discovery, Education, Service, and Leadership. Donors can choose which part of the campaign to donate to when they give money on the school’s donation page. The goal for “Discovery,” the campaign’s research arm, was the largest, at $500 million.
Progress toward each of the four goals has not been even. Last December, Medical School Dean George Q. Daley said “the financial aid and education bucket” was lagging behind the rest of the campaign. The “Service” branch of the campaign, by contrast, had already surpassed its goal of $50 million by Oct. 2015.
According to Boudreau, over 10,000 donors contributed to the $750 million total.
The Medical School reached its goal amid difficulties balancing its budget in recent years. Last fiscal year, HMS ran a $44 million deficit, the ninth year in the last decade that the school has closed in the red.
“We have very, very strong plans to bring the budget into balance. It does require some significant belt-tightening, which we’ve asked for across our staff administration and faculty,” Daley said.
In response to the budget deficit, the school has decided to sell some of its property at 4 Blackfan Circle on its Longwood campus.
The University as a whole has raised over $8 billion since its capital campaign began in 2013, exceeding its goal of $6.5 billion in April 2016. This campaign has included some of the University’s largest donations in history, including a $350 million gift to the School of Public Health and a $400 million donation to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, both of which prompted Harvard to rename the schools.

Newly elected Cambridge City Councillors Alanna M. Mallon and Sumbul Siddiqui launched a podcast titled “Women Are Here” on Jan. 24 with a conversation that touched on subjects ranging from Cardi B to public works.
In the podcast, Mallon and Siddiqui shared their experiences as women legislators. The idea for the project emerged while the two were campaigning last year and started talking “jokingly” about producing a podcast, Siddiqui said.
But after Mallon and Siddiqui both won positions on the council last fall, they approached Cambridge Community Television to make the podcast a reality.
“Both of us being elected for the first time and being women in this wave of women legislators that are running and winning,” Mallon said. “We just wanted to catalogue that journey together, and hopefully people can come along with us.”
The title of the podcast came from the words of poet Eileen Myles, who Siddiqui quoted in a speech at the Cambridge Women’s March in January. Mallon and Siddiqui said the event resonated with them.
“The woman turning, that’s the revolution. The room is gigantic, the woman is here,” Myles wrote in the statement, which became the titular inspiration for the podcast.
In this election year, a record number of women are running for public office across the U.S., according to TIME Magazine. Locally last fall, four out of nine councillors elected to the Cambridge City Council were women. The two candidates that received the most votes were also women.
“I think there’s a real appetite right now to see women leading and working together and seeing what it would look like to have more women in politics,” Mallon said.
The latest episode of the podcast included guest speaker Police Superintendent Christine A. Elow, who discussed Cambridge policing practices with the councillors.
“We want to focus on women leaders and community members so that more people know about the important work that’s being done and the important women who are doing it,” Siddiqui said.
The podcast also strives to keep residents up-to-date with the proceedings of the city, especially during periods like non-election years, when people feel less connected to politics, Mallon said.
“We thought, it’s kind of an ageless thing—Sumbul’s generation, my generation, everyone listens to podcasts,” Mallon said. “We just felt like it’d be a good, easy way for people to stay engaged if we made it fun and interesting.”
Mallon and Siddiqui said they hope the podcast will help Cantabrigians better understand issues the council is working on in an “easily digestible” way. The podcast allows them to communicate with the public so residents can see them as “real people,” Siddiqui said.
As city councillors, Mallon and Siddiqui are in a position to see the inner workings of the municipal government, Mallon said. With the podcast, the two hope the public will be able to better see the work the city accomplishes, she said.
“For us, we get to see it everyday, but we want to make sure it translates to our residents,” Mallon said. “I think it’s really about highlighting these amazing women but also the amazing things our city is doing that’s not really seen by the general public.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thousands of students across the campuses of Harvard, Brown, Columbia, and Wellesley started their Valentine’s Day mornings with a pink-accented message in their email inbox: Datamatch 2018 results were in and matches were waiting.
This year's iteration of the program marked the first year that Datamatch, the Harvard Computer Society’s 24-year-old digital matchmaking program, expanded to other schools based on popular demand.
In total, nearly 9,000 students completed and submitted surveys, though many students waited to do so until just minutes before the deadline Tuesday night, according to Datamatch team members. Datamatch’s expansion beyond Harvard brought increased participation, with an estimated 4,400 more students looking for digital love this year compared to last year.
“We actually extended the deadline by an hour,” Datamatch lead staffer and "Supreme Cupid" Larry Zhang ’18 said. “So many people were just trying to update their profile last minute, or sign up last minute, so we were like, ‘Okay, you know what? We’re going to give you guys one more hour, we know you guys were procrastinating. We’re going to help you guys out here.’”
When Datamatch results first came out Wednesday morning, the number of students trying to check their matches overwhelmed the site’s servers, leading to error messages and student complaints, according to Datamatch "Stats Cupid" Sara Valente ’19.
“We actually had to expand the capabilities of our tech, and pay extra money this year,” Valente said, speaking about the Computer Society's need to handle the increased amount of traffic on the server.
While HCS has not yet finalized statistics, Valente said Datamatch at Harvard saw roughly 4,300 participants. This year, in addition to regular incentives from Harvard Square vendors like Berryline and Zinneken’s, Harvard Datamatch participants have the chance to receive one of 60 tickets to three showings of Intermission Impossible, the spring show put on by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.
Bringing Datamatch to multiple schools presented new challenges for the Datamatch team, according to team members, including a restructuring of the login interface for each school. Despite these challenges, team members said Datamatch found success at other institutions—Brown had about 3,000 participants, Columbia had about 1,000, and Wellesley had about 500, according to Valente.
Brown student Cashen Conroy, who worked with Datamatch to bring the algorithm to Providence, said the novelty of Datamatch excited Brown students.
“Given the size of Brown, it’s easy to go through college here and not meet everyone that you might end up connecting with,” Conroy said. “I think people were excited about the prospect of doing that.”
Wellesley Computer Science Club President Andrea Jackson said Datamatch generated a buzz on campus. She noted that half of all Wellesley participants signed up on the first day Datamatch opened.
“A lot of people were happy to do it even though it was a lot of platonic matching happening,” Jackson said, though she noted that plans to pair Wellesley with another school are in the works.

UPDATED: February 17, 2018 at 4:07 p.m.
A recent spike in conservative speakers invited to the Harvard Kennedy School has left students divided over the issue—some say the speakers are needed to foster a more complete discussion, while others question invited individuals' morals.
In recent months, Elmendorf invited several conservative speakers to the Kennedy School, including fall Institute of Politics fellows Congressman Jason E. Chaffetz and Mark Strand.
Students have criticized some of the invitations, most notably the Sept. 2017 visit of United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and visiting fellowships offered to former Trump Administration officials Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski.
Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said the Kennedy School would benefit from having “more prominent conservative voices.”
“I do think about how to present a full range of views at the Kennedy School and make sure that people who don’t agree are talking about those disagreements and not just ducking each other,” Elemedorf said.
Professor David R. Gergen said the dean’s push to include conservatives at the Kennedy School is not a new initiative. Gergen said when he first arrived at the school in the late 1990s, former Dean Joseph S. Nye approached him about including more conservatives in the Institute of Politics fellows program.
“Doug is not the first, but I do admire the fact that he is serious about it,” Gergen said.
William H. Tobey, a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and a self-identified conservative, said that, though conservatives are a “minority” at the Kennedy School, he values the discussions about ideological differences. He co-teaches a course with former Clinton Administration official Matthew Bunn on nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.
“I value the ability to be there with different views because I think it helps to sharpen my own ideas and arguments,” Tobey said. “I regard argument to be in its best form a truth-seeking device.”
John D. Krohn, a master’s student who described himself as a moderate Republican, said that—while he thinks the administration is fostering an environment in which conservatives are welcome—he often does not see the same type of “appreciation” from his classmates.
Krohn said he was disappointed with his peers’ criticisms of the Kennedy School's recent selection of Ohio Governor John R. Kasich as this year’s graduation speaker.
“It’s sad from my perspective that here we have a man who’s championing public service for really his entire adult life, and because we live in a time where partisan gridlock is palpable and real, that people are reflexively responding to this man’s political party without fully understanding the public service that he has provided to his country,” Krohn said.
“I think that’s emblactic of some of the things I see in my daily interactions at the Kennedy School,” he added.
Though there is support for dialogue across the aisle, some students said they are worried some are conflating protesting conservatives with protesting those who have made poor moral choices.
Jeff Rousset, a master’s student who participated in the DeVos protest, said the Kennedy School must keep a “moral compass” when choosing speakers.
“In the fall, when I joined other HKS students in challenging some of the conservative speakers who were invited to speak, it wasn’t because they were conservative, it was because they were complicit in what many of us saw as really unethical behaviors and sometimes even illegal behaviors,” Rousset said.
He cited accusations that Lewandowski had assaulted a female reporter and allegations that Spicer had lied to the public during his time as press secretary.
Amidst this type of debate, Elmendorf said universities must be a place open to dialogue.
“Universities are, at their core, places to develop and transmit knowledge and that knowledge can be unpleasant or inconvenient,” Elmendorf said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 19, 2018 at 9:47 p.m.
At 66, incoming University President Lawrence S. Bacow will be the oldest president ever to take charge of Harvard when he moves into Massachusetts Hall this summer—experts, though, say his age is unlikely to determine the length of his tenure.
Bacow will be the first president since Charles Chauncy—Harvard’s second president—to begin his tenure at an age above 60. Bacow’s predecessor, current President Drew G. Faust, was inaugurated at age 59.
Judith A. Wilde, a professor at George Mason University’s School of Policy and Government, cited a study from the American Council on Education that found five percent of university presidents were over the age of 70 in 2011, but 11 percent were over the same age in 2016. A survey of over 1,500 American colleges and universities revealed that 58 percent of college presidents are above the age of 60, according to the Council.
Wilde said age is unlikely to be a strong factor in determining the length of a presidential posting.
“This is just a personal opinion, but I think more and more are seeing themselves as vibrant and active,” Wilde said. “If I feel like I still can be of benefit to a university, why should I stop just because I hit a specific age?”
In addition to setting a historical record at Harvard, Bacow will soon be the third-oldest president among the presidents currently leading all eight Ivy League schools. He will trail only University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann and Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, who are 68 and 71, respectively.
If Bacow serves a 12-year term—the average tenure length of Harvard’s 28 presidents—he will be 78 years old at the end of his time in office. The last president to serve into his seventies was Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who served from 1909 to 1933, at which point he stepped down, aged 76.
Raymond D. Cotton, an attorney specializing in higher education leadership, said he was “very pleased” by Bacow’s selection.
“Larry is exceptional. It’s not just because of his interactions with me, but with everybody,” said Cotton, who noted that Bacow often went running with undergraduates during his Tufts tenure. “I would not judge him strictly by his age.”
Cotton said the typical tenure of a university president would include a three-year contract followed by a five-year contract. For a president with prior experience—like Bacow— a tenure can last up to ten years, according to Cotton.
When Bacow stepped down from the Tufts presidency in 2011, he said a decade formed the ideal time period for a presidential tenure. The longest-serving Harvard president to date is Charles W. Eliot, who served 40 years, from 1869 to 1909.
“I have often said that 10 years is about the right term for a university president,” Bacow said at the time. “It is long enough for one individual to have a substantial impact but not so long that the institution, or the president, becomes comfortable.”
Cotton said he hopes that Bacow will indeed pursue a ten-year tenure.
“I hope he stays at least ten years,” Cotton said. “With an institution like Harvard, it takes time to change the culture because you have to bring everyone on board.”

A previous version of this article incorrectly asserted University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will be the second-oldest president among presidents of Ivy League Schools when he takes office. In fact, he will be the third-oldest; both University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann and Columbia University President Lee Bollinger are older.

Harvard’s Faculty Council voted in favor of a new engineering concentration and discussed proposals concerning the Neurobiology department and the Asia Center at its biweekly meeting Wednesday.
The Council, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body, followed up on a proposal it first heard at its Jan. 24 meeting by voting to support the creation of a new concentration in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The proposal suggests changing the environmental science engineering track within the engineering sciences program to a formal concentration.
Council member David L. Howell said the plan garnered “a lot of support” from other members and that he believes the proposal is “very straightforward” and “logical.”
“In engineering, they have different tracks within engineering, and the new environmental science and engineering concentration sort of brings that into line with the other concentrations that they have in engineering,” he said.
The proposal will likely come up for discussion at the next full Faculty meeting in March. Barring major changes, the Faculty will vote on it at their April meeting.
Executive Director of the Asia Center Elizabeth Liao presented a proposal to the Council on behalf of Professor Karen L. Thornber and advocated the dissolution of the Council on Asian Studies, a FAS standing committee.
Howell, an East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor himself, said he supported the proposal because the Asia Center already fulfills the main functions of the Council on Asian Studies, rendering the Council “redundant.” According to Howell, the Asia Center acts as an umbrella organization and a forum for scholars studying Asia.
“The Council on Asian Studies had done a lot of that previously, but now those sorts of functions of bringing people to work on Asia together throughout the University has gone over to the Asia Center,” Howell said. “That's why we don't need the Council on Asian Studies anymore.”
The Council also heard from Professor Jeff Lichtman on a proposal to change the name of the Neurobiology concentration. The proposal advocates adopting the name Neuroscience in order to better reflect the term used by scientists in the field.
The Council will likely vote on the suggested name change for the Neurobiology department and the dissolution of the Council on Asian Studies at their next meeting on Feb. 28.

UPDATED: February 15, 2018 at 4:42 p.m.
Some College-run advising and mentorship programs tailored to freshmen recently published guidelines outlining how they may be affected by the College’s social group penalties, though the Office of Student Life has yet to release an official enforcement plan for the sanctions.
The policy—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
In an interview in early February, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana declined to give a timeline for the release of a final enforcement plan for the penalties, instead tasking the Office of Student Life with formulating implementation guidelines. He said in February that the Office is currently working to finalize the details and will take as long as it needs to “get this right.”
Nonetheless, some College-run programs have begun taking matters into their own hands. Both the First-Year Outdoor Program and the Peer Advising Fellows program posted interpretations of how the sanctions may affect them on their respective websites.
The website for FOP—an initiative that sends incoming freshmen and undergraduate “leaders” on camping trips ahead of the start of school—states that, as of now, all students will be eligible to serve as FOP leaders, no matter whether they are also members of sanctioned organizations. The website adds, though, that—beginning with the Class of 2021—students who join unrecognized single-gender social groups “should not expect to also be able to serve on FOP's Steering Committee,” the undergraduate body that governs the program.
FOP Director Paul R. “Coz” Teplitz ’03 said the Office of Student Life is “aware” of the online announcement. But he added the statement itself comes only from the leaders of FOP and the Freshman Dean’s Office.
Teplitz emphasized FOP is still awaiting an official enforcement policy from the College. He said FOP released guidelines ahead of the final plan given its timeline for recruitment; students interested in serving as FOP leaders were required to submit applications by Dec. 6, 2017.
“We are still waiting for guidance from OSL and we also felt the time pressure… about wanting people in the Class of 2021 to be able to make informed decisions,” Teplitz said. “So we decided to move forward with this plan as the plan that we thought would be consistent with the descriptions of the policy as has been written.”
Asked whether FOP would change its policy if future guidance from the OSL conflicts with the current guidelines posted online, Teplitz said he does not think so. He said FOP plans to hold students “accountable” only to the information they possessed at the time the undergraduates applied to join FOP.
“If there are students of [the Class of] 2021 who are members of USGSOs who are still interested in becoming FOP leaders and we choose them as leaders, but in two or three months we learn guidance from the OSL that that is not with the ideal, we would fight pretty hard to allow those students to participate as leaders for a year, and then we would change for the following years,” Teplitz said.
The Peer Advising Fellows program, a campus student mentorship system that pairs freshmen with other undergraduates, has also recently sought to interpret the sanctions.
The Advising Programs Office, which administers the PAF program, posted on its website that all students—regardless of social group affiliation—will be eligible to apply to become a PAF. The statement notes, however, that this does not mean all applicants will earn PAF offers.
In the online posting, the Advising Programs Office added it is currently working with the Office of Student Life to determine how—exactly—the sanctions may affect the PAF initiative.
“As the OSL considers implementation of the policy, OSL will offer guidance about how the policy relates to the PAF program,” the website reads. “Members of the Class of 2021, especially, should note that clarification of the PAF program policy will be issued before official offers are made.”
Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05, the director of the Peer Advising Fellows program, did not immediately respond to comment Wednesday.
Katherine W. Steele, the director of pre-orientation programs at the Freshman Dean’s Office, said in an interview Wednesday that she has met with the directors of all freshman pre-orientation programs—including FOP—to discuss the role of the sanctions in their respective recruitment processes.
“In the same way that you’re seeing FOP communication about this in their application process, ideally this same thing would happen with all the programs,” Steele said. “The language you see with FOP is likely to be very similar to language that you will see for other programs.”
Steele said more announcements will come along with the “natural application cycle and process.”

UPDATED: February 19, 2018 at 2:58 p.m.
Twenty-one years after the first woman assumed the presidency of the Undergraduate Council, many current representatives say the UC continues to grapple with issues of gender equality and inclusivity.
During last Sunday’s UC general meeting, Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman '20 and Quincy House representative Wyatt M. Robertson ’18 gave a presentation outlining their findings on gender dynamics within the UC, after spending months seeking interviews with every non-male member of the Council. Both said they think the Council can sometimes take male representatives more seriously than other UC representatives.
“A lot of times when men are up here, they're not questioned as much about their experiences and the research that goes into it,” Robertson said. “A lot of times when other people are up here, a lot of non-men, whether it's queer people, genderqueer people, or women presenting up here, a lot of the research and experiences do get called into question.”
Over the past several months, multiple representatives said the Council has made strides towards ensuring women are represented in leadership and feel comfortable speaking up at meetings. Many non-male representatives said improvements this year in female representation in leadership and on the Council at large have served as a first step in overcoming the lingering effects of a historically male-dominated student government.
But some representatives said the Council must continue to focus on issues it has long failed to address.
“Whenever a woman comes to the front of the room... it's almost like ‘unqualified until proven qualified’ instead of the other way around,” Crimson Yard representative Sonya Kalara ’21 said.
In an emailed statement, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 wrote she is committed to ensuring all members of the Council are given an equal voice.
“[Council Vice President] Nick [Boucher] and I are both extremely dedicated to making sure the UC is upholding our community norms of respect, inclusion, diversity, among many others, and a huge part of that is ensuring that all of our female representatives feel as if this council is just as much theirs as anyone else,” Zhang wrote.
Zhang particularly cited the increased representation of women in UC leadership roles and the recent midterm elections as evidence these efforts have begun to bear fruit. For three consecutive years, women have stood at the helm of the UC.
Nonetheless, multiple female Council members say female representation at the top has papered over the structural barriers that non-male members continue to face in attaining leadership roles and feeling comfortable speaking up at Council meetings.
When the Undergraduate Council was officially established in 1982, Harvard College was still disproportionately male. While the College had instituted sex-blind admissions in 1977—when the ratio of men to women at the College stood at four to one—the process of moving the needle on female representation at Harvard was slow. As late as 1988, males still outnumbered females roughly 60 percent to 40 percent, and not until 2004 did the College achieve gender parity.
The first years of the Council were dominated by male leadership. In fact, at least its first 12 chairmen—a position replaced by the presidency in 1996—were male.
While the Council was by no means conservative on gender issues—voting to urge administrators to hire more female faculty members in 1988 and condemning all-male final clubs in 1989, among other examples—the lingering effects of a largely male-controlled body continue to affect the UC, according to some current Council members.
“For a long time, the leadership has primarily been male,” Pforzheimer House representative Rainbow Yeung ’19, an inactive Crimson blog editor, said. “And there’s some sort of established role, some unintentional biases that may have been passed on to today.”
Still, there have been internal efforts to increase female representation on the UC. In 2010, the Council passed legislation increasing outreach to prospective female candidates. The Council almost reached gender parity among declared candidates and elected representatives in 2013; but in 2014, only one in three members of the UC were female.
Current representatives say structural barriers continue to pose obstacles to women trying to attain leadership roles on the Council.
Female representatives cited the informal process of grooming leadership—in which a committee chair chooses a younger member to mentor and eventually take over as chair—as particularly difficult to overcome.
Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who served as the only female committee chair out of seven total chairs last semester, said she had to “navigate” the grooming process in order to gain her position as education committee chair.
“The committee chair oftentimes will have certain people in mind that they are trying to groom for this position, that they're supporting on a more individual basis, and providing structural support,” Palaniappan said. “That same support is not equally provided to a female member within that committee.”
Kalara echoed these concerns, saying the selective nature of the “grooming” process can hinder women’s ability to move up within the Council.
“If you are a woman who is participating in a committee but you feel like you will never make leadership because you're not ‘in with the boys,’ it can be very exclusionary,” Kalara said.
Some female representatives said they are often hesitant to speak up at Council meetings.   Others said they think members of the UC disproportionately tune out during female representatives’ speeches as compared to their male counterparts’ speeches.
Robertson pointed to quotes in articles written in The Crimson as a sign of the gender disparity on the Council.
“We looked at every single one of the [UC] Gen[eral meeting] articles that came out in the entire calendar year,” Robertson said. “79 percent of the articles quoted more men than women.”
Several representatives pointed to a UC meeting held Oct. 15 as a defining moment in the Council’s efforts to combat gender imbalances.
The meeting came a few weeks after U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos implemented a policy raising the standard of proof in sexual assault cases. The new policy, which replaced an Obama-era guideline making it easier for schools to punish accused abusers, met with resistance from many UC representatives.
Two female Council members, Julia M. Huesa ’20 and Abdelrahman, decided to present a resolution condemning DeVos’s policy change and calling on College administrators to maintain the lower burden of proof they had instituted in 2014.
Yet the resolution faced opposition from several male representatives and sparked controversy during the meeting. Multiple UC representatives then called for a roll-call vote—in place of a typical hand or voice vote—in order to identify exactly who opposed the legislation.
“It was a breaking point,” Student Relations Committee Chair Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 said. “For the first time, vocally, identities came into play on the Council.”
In an email to UC members after the meeting, former UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 urged representatives to consider the perspectives of their fellow Council members.
“We cannot assume others’ intentions when we work together in this Council and cannot boil down our votes to our identities,” Khansarinia wrote in the email. “This has now been said a few times by a few different people and I think it's time to close the book.”
Multiple representatives—including Zhang—declined to speak about the October meeting, citing fear that it could reignite divisions of the past semester.
Amid tensions and continued unequal representation on the Council, female representatives said they have relied on each other for support, both informally and through more structured channels such as the Council’s Women’s Caucus.
“We met up one evening in Catherine Zhang's room and just talked,” Ivy Yard representative Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21 said. “And we realized that a lot of these experiences were shared and I think that was the first thing to building a community and a shared voice.”
Though female Council members said there is still room for improvement, many said they were encouraged by changes they have seen since Zhang assumed the UC presidency in December.
Multiple representatives pointed to the marked increase in female representation in leadership roles as particularly important. With more non-male UC members in leadership, some female representatives said they felt more confident in speaking up at general meetings and committee forums.
Last fall, non-male representatives encouraged each other to run for higher office within the Council, with several representatives saying the efforts were impactful.
“I definitely sensed an active effort by members of the Council in order to encourage more female leadership,” Palaniappan said. “Whoever is in leadership has the ability to set the tone of the Council and to really create an environment that respects and values every member within it.”
UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20 said she personally worked to level the playing field and provide an avenue for women and other underrepresented minorities to ascend the ranks of Council leadership.
“I think now as treasurer, one of my biggest goals is to make the financial realm of the Undergraduate Council so much more acceptable to women and to take a lot of people under my wing and make them feel like there's no barrier to entry,” Khoury said. “Even if it seems like legislation on the Finance Committee has a lot of jargon, even if it seems kind of distant and esoteric, I want to break down that barrier.”
This semester, out of the 13 members on the UC’s executive committee—comprising the Council’s president, vice president, committee chairs, and other Council leaders—six are women and one is non-binary, according to UC Secretary Jackson C. Walker ’21. Those figures represent an increase from last year, when only three members of the executive committee were non-males, according to Palaniappan.
In addition, seven of the ten winning candidates in this month’s midterm election were female.
Whittaker also said they feel the Council has begun to make progress on gender-related issues.
“We're talking about stuff on the Council we've never talked about before,” Whittaker said.  “So while I know a lot of people are kind of frustrated by the anger that seems to be on the Council, frustrated by the vitriol by these kind of scenarios, I think they're quite a good thing because I think it means we're addressing things that weren't addressed before.”

For almost half a century, students have been calling on the University to build and fund a multicultural center. For nearly half a century, Harvard has said no.
Calling for a physical space for students of marginalized backgrounds, generations of campus advocates for a multicultural center have argued the building represents a necessary means to foster inclusion for Harvard’s increasingly diverse student body.
After a September draft report from the University-wide task force for diversity and inclusion recommended the creation of centers for “Identity, Politics, and Culture” and “Inclusion and Belonging,” and after Harvard has created more offices and administrative positions for work on diversity, some students say they are hopeful that now—after years and years of frustration—a multicultural center will come to fruition.
The Undergraduate Council  also recently redoubled efforts to push for this initiative with the development of the Multicultural Center Coalition. Last month, they held a town hall to hear student perspectives on the creation of a center.
“If you say that you care about diversity when you're admitting students, but not when they actually attend the University, that shows an inherent conflict in their values, and I think we need to change that going forward,” Sonya Kalara ’21, a UC representative, said at the town hall.
In an interview earlier this month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said Harvard is carefully considering a multicultural center and is making sure to consult all affected affiliates.
“We don’t want to just rush into something without making sure that we really brought everybody along and everybody’s had a chance to participate in what way feels right to them,” Khurana said.
The recent spark in student advocacy for a multicultural center forms the latest episode in a long-running debate on Harvard’s campus and has roots in the nationwide campus protests of the 1960s.
After student civil rights protests consumed college campuses across the nation in the 1960s and 1970s, students at many Ivy League schools began advocating for various forms of cultural centers.
At some institutions, these centers manifested in the form of a multicultural center, like the Third World Centers at Princeton and Brown, both of which opened in the 1970s and were later renamed. Yale took a different approach, building culturally distinct centers around the same time. These included the Afro-American Cultural Center that opened in 1969 and La Casa Cultural that opened in 1974.
“Our center, specifically, was a result of students speaking up and wanting a center for their specific identity,” said Sheraz Iqbal, the assistant director of the Asian American Center at Yale. “A lot of the centers, not just at Yale, but in other places that have this distinction between multicultural center and cultural centers is a result of student voice, student activism.”
Students pushed for the creation of a multicultural center at Harvard in the 1960s, too. The Faculty Committee on African and Afro-American Studies published a report around the time that called for the creation of a black student center, eventually resulting in the opening of the Harvard-Radcliffe Afro-American Cultural Center in 1969. The center did not receive any funding from the University, though; a lack that ultimately led to its closure in 1974.
When student groups jointly submitted a proposal for a multicultural center in 1995, then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III opposed it, saying it would divide the student body.
"It would be inconsistent with [Harvard's] purpose to set aside space for racial, ethnic and cultural groups," Epps said at the time. "Third-world or multicultural centers promote racial separation."
Instead, Epps pointed to the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. He said the foundation served "to help students share different cultures and ethnic traditions within the College."
Over 40 years later, Harvard still does not have a multicultural center. The College, though, has taken several other steps in an effort to make campus more diverse and more inclusive.
“In recent years, the College has implemented several key initiatives that underscore our commitment to inclusion and belonging,” Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis wrote in an email.
Davis pointed to the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, which opened in 2014, as an example. The EDI is comprised of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Harvard College Women’s Center.
He also lauded the College’s newly renovated space in Grays Hall, which houses the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
Despite these efforts, many students maintain that a multicultural center is still necessary, arguing that students of color feel they need a space for collaboration and community.
“I think it'd be really nice for multicultural organizations to have one because I also think it's something that would enforce a lot of collaboration among groups that tend to be more separate,” Simi N. Shah ’19, co-president of Harvard South Asian Association, said.
“Some of it stems from lack of a common space,” she added.
Supporters of a multicultural center also argue it would create a space on campus where they would not have to continually teach their peers about the difficulties of being a person of color.
Salma Abdelrahman ’20, who leads the UC’s Multicultural Center Coalition, said Harvard students often say conversations in dorm rooms or dining halls comprise the best place for learning about and from people of different backgrounds and cultures.
“That's all very coded language for, sometimes in my experience, what's been an expectation of students of color being the sort of teachers in situations that feel very power-skewed,” she said.
Abdelrahman said she believes the best solution to this problem is creating a physical center that specifically caters to the needs of students from underrepresented backgrounds.
“The importance of a physical space is paramount in this discussion because it's a space that people can go to feel that they're not operating in a building that was built by people that don't look like them, for people that don't look like them, with the names of people that don't look like them branded on the front of the building,” she said.
Regarding what a multicultural center might contain, some students said they envision it as a forum for events, discussion, and even research.
“I think it should be a space with conference rooms, offices, and an auditorium. It should be a huge space that allows for discussion, organization, and cooperation between groups,” Diego Navarrete ’21 said.
Navarette serves as a political action chair for Fuerza Latina and as a communication co-chair for Act on a Dream, an immigrant rights advocacy group.
In addition, given the longstanding push for an Ethnic Studies concentration at Harvard, Navarrete also suggested a multicultural center would be the ideal location to house a future Ethnic Studies department.
“I think that one of the main things about having a multicultural center is having a space that promotes not only diversity and inclusion, but also the academic study of race and ethnicity,” he said.
Many students question why this fight has taken so many decades. While the College is aware of these persistent demands, administrators say they believe a process as delicate and as important as this must not be rushed.
Khurana said the College needs to hear from a wide variety of students before it can approve a multicultural center.
“If you really respect people’s participation, then you have to listen to them. You have to make sure all voices are heard,” he said.
Still, advocates say they are frustrated by what they call the slow pace of progress, especially after decades of echoing calls for a multicultural center have all proved unsuccessful.
“A physical space might seem like a lot to do, but I think that Harvard students of color have been advocating for it for decades,” Navarrete said. “I feel like it’s Harvard’s responsibility to answer to those claims and finally put the money where their mouth is.”
