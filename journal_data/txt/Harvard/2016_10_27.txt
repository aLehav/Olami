After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Democrats will continue focusing on consolidating Democratic gains both up and down the ballot in battleground states, according to president Susan X. Wang ’17.
At the national level, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton’s campaign is making a more ambitious effort in traditionally right-leaning states–a move that serves to both extend her lead over Trump and bolster down-ballot candidates locked in tighter races. Wang said that she did not see a need for the College Democrats to revise their canvassing and phone-banking strategy in response.
“Right now we’re still focusing on the states we’ve been hitting in the past,” Wang said, mentioning New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. “They’re the states we know best, and that’s where we see our role.”
FiveThirtyEight, a website known for election predictions, currently gives Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton a 85.4 percent chance of winning the presidential race, compared to 14.6 percent for Trump. In contrast, Clinton’s edge over Trump a month ago was less than 10 percent—54.8 percent to 45.2 percent.
“It’s really exciting that [traditionally right-leaning states] are now up for grabs, but we’re trying to ensure that she locks down the states that she needs to win the election,” Wang said.
In an email sent out to past volunteers encouraging them to join the Democrats’ efforts, Sharon Yang ’18, the vice president of the Democrats and an inactive Crimson editor, wrote, “We’re working hard to not just elect the first female President, but to take back the Senate and maybe even win the House.”
Wang said the Harvard Democrats are focusing on tight races such as Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan’s contest with incumbent U.S. senator Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Democratic congressional candidate Emily Cain’s race against U.S. Representative Bruce Poliquin in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District.
The College Democrats plan to canvass in New Hampshire on Oct. 29. In addition, they will conduct “get-out-to-vote” efforts on Nov. 5 and 6 in New Hampshire and Maine, the weekend before Election Day.
On Election Day, the club plans to have students canvassing in New Hampshire, phone banking on campus, and encouraging Harvard students to vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 22-day dining worker strike officially ended Wednesday after employees voted overwhelmingly to approve a new contract with Harvard, capping off months of tense negotiations with the University.
Workers could return to the dining halls as early as Thursday morning, according to Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents the Harvard University Dining Services employees.
Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga said that all dining halls and their respective grilles will reopen Friday morning starting with breakfast, while pack-out lunches will become available Monday.
The final vote by union members was 583-1 in favor of the contract, according to Carlos R. Aramayo, financial secretary treasurer of Local 26, who took the official tally of voters’ paper ballots. The voting, held at First Parish Church, began at 2 p.m. and closed at 5 p.m.
With their agreement Wednesday, Harvard and its employees brought an end to a historic strike that roiled campus, closed dining halls, and drew widespread national attention.
The last official day of the strike was a joyous one for HUDS workers, many of whom said they felt the agreement met all of their demands, which included raising the minimum worker’s yearly salary to $35,000 and providing consistent summer pay for employees. Celebrations began at 2 p.m. outside the church, when Lang reported the details of the new contract to the assembled crowd of roughly 100 HUDS employees and student supporters.
Lang announced, to cheers, that the union had “achieved every goal, without exception” at the close of negotiations. He added that the favorable result was a “testament to when working-class people make a decision to draw a line in the sand,” but also a “particular testament” to HUDS workers’ strength.
“What started out as simple proposals, reasonable proposals for us to be able to provide for ourselves and our families turned into a struggle for the soul of this institution,” Lang said. “It garnered worldwide focus and attention and we’re happy to report that, in this battle, the forces for equality, justice, and a humane approach prevailed.”
Those present began to cheer as soon as Lang finished speaking, jumping up and down while waving signs reading “Support The Strike.” Workers hugged and thanked the handful of students—mostly members of the Student Labor Action Movement, the organization that coordinated undergraduate efforts to back the strike–who joined them outside the church.
“I’m still on cloud nine, I can’t believe it, I love the contract,” Anabela A. Pappas, a HUDS worker, said as she wiped tears from her eyes. “It’s been emotional for three weeks. But today is a good, happy, emotional day.”
Pappas, along with other HUDS employees, said she felt closer to people on campus, from students to faculty members to the shop-owners in Harvard Square, after the strike.
“Now I walk through Harvard Square, it’s a new Harvard Square for me,” Pappas said. “I used to walk through the square, no one knew me, we never said ‘Hi’ to each other. Now you walk a couple of inches and everyone’s like, ‘Hey, Bella!’”
“It’s just such a love,” she added.
HUDS worker Amanda L. Vaquerano agreed, calling students who had supported the strike “angels.” SLAM member Grace F. Evans ’19 said she wanted to emphasize that the day belonged to HUDS employees.
“This win is all the workers, this win isn’t about the students,” she said as she embraced HUDS employees outside the church. “I’m so proud of [the workers], and I’m so proud to be a member of the Harvard community today.”
Though the crowd outside First Parish Church dispersed soon after Lang’s speech, the day was not yet over. HUDS workers continued to file into the building to place their votes until 5 p.m. At 5:30 p.m., Aramayo announced the final count to the room, drawing cheers from the few remaining Local 26 members present.
Students eating in dining halls across campus Wednesday evening said they were glad to hear that HUDS workers would soon return to work. Some said they were particularly excited for the food.
Raahul Acharya ’20 said he had frequently chosen to eat out at restaurants during the strike and added that his life was “going to get much better now that I have a stable source of food.”
“I’m really glad that after all these negotiations, they were finally able to reach a resolution,” Kaitavjeet Chowdhary ’17 said. “It will be great to have the workers back and have that sense of community again, and obviously to have the food back again.”

“I don’t believe in ghosts. They’re just figments of my imagination.”
I’ve told myself that countless times, but I can never say it convincingly. For some reason, I never fully believe it.
Growing up as a kid who watched too many horror movies, I was scared out of my mind that a ghost could exist. So I purposely decided to believe that ghosts are nonsense.
Aliens? Definitely. Vampires? Maybe. But ghosts? Hell no.
It’s November 2014, and I’m living in the marine barracks at the Boston Naval Shipyard for a week as part of a school field trip. It’s past midnight, and I’m ready to pass out in my bedroom. Before I can, I hear the park ranger tell our teacher, “I have to warn you, the barracks are haunted.”
Long story short, I did not get a good night’s sleep.
The next days go smoothly—I take a behind-the-scenes tour of the U.S.S. Constitution, try clam chowder from Quincy Market, and pose next to seagulls at the Harbor. But on the last night, after finishing one of our hyper-competitive games of Monopoly, we’re startled by a sound—something like sandpaper rubbing against a carpet.
We stop in our tracks. The lights are off, but we’re too scared to find the light switch. I try to stay calm, but my childhood fear of ghosts has paralyzed me.
The rough sawing sound doesn’t stop. “It’s moving closer,” I whisper to my friends.
And then, I see it. A large silhouette, at least six feet tall, looms over us. It’s clutching a dagger in one hand. Heavy chains are draped over its shoulder. In that moment, every childhood nightmare came flooding back. Something I had tried to repress for so long had come to haunt me again.
I’m not proud of what happened next, but I bolted. And of course, being the idiot I was, I ran straight into the kitchen counter.
And then, the ghost spoke.
“Are you OK, David?” he exclaimed, turning on the light.
As my watering eyes peered up at what was supposed to be the embodiment of all my fears, I realized it was just my friend. There was no dagger: It was just a shampoo bottle. And those heavy chains? His bath towel.
I had never been more embarrassed. Looking back, my friends and I get a good laugh out of it, but my instinctive reaction still troubles me.
I lacked courage, lacked bravery. I didn’t want to investigate the mysterious figure—I think because I was afraid of the answer. I don’t think I was happier not knowing, but was  more comfortable imprisoning myself in Schrodinger’s dilemma of perpetual doubt.
The longer I think about my night in the marine barracks, the more I realize how my reaction translates into so many other aspects of my life. I’ve spent many sleepless nights debating myself, trying to convince myself that knowing and not liking is better than not knowing at all. This constant internal argument is one of my many ghosts.
And every time I take the coward’s way out, I add a ghost to my collection. First crush? One of many relationship ghosts. Choosing to study instead of party? The ghost of FOMO. Eating with my same old friends instead of saying hello to someone new? Yet another. Every day I tell myself, “I’m going to do this tomorrow.” And every day, I wait for another tomorrow until there aren’t any left.
So many what-ifs, so many “what could have been” scenarios—all ghosts dogging my footsteps.
These wasted chances still haunt me. They never leave me, tattooed not on my skin but on my hesitant smile, my loose handshake, and my reserved personality. I still find it hard to go out of my comfort zone—at every turn, there’s a ghost sewn onto my shadow.
But at college, a place that feels like one everlasting summer camp, I’m no longer running away and hitting obstacles. I’ve started to face my ghosts, one by one. I don’t know how or why this change has started happening, but when I’m scared of an answer, instead of hiding from it, I actively seek it out. And one by one,  I’ve found my ghosts are disappearing.
Soon, I hope to be able to say, this time with conviction, that “I don’t believe in ghosts. They’re just figments of my imagination.”

If you ever want to feel like you’re behind on pop culture, spend a summer with 10th graders. “You don’t know who Austin Mahone is?” “You didn’t give anyone your Snapchat password to keep up your streaks?” “You keep your Instagrams up even if they don’t get likes?”
My 15-year-old campers goggle at me. Though the age gap between us is narrow, as they waste no time reminding me, the three year difference puts me in a place where I can relate to them and yet still retain authority and maybe even a little wisdom.
Every time they pull out Tiger Beat Magazine, I can’t help but think about myself at 15.
Fifteen was a weird age. Constant fluctuation. I would feel so sure of myself and who I was for a moment, but the moment was always fleeting. A feeling would change or click and suddenly I would be really sure of something completely different. I wore a lot of cardigans. I was into peace signs, unironically. I inhabited my own world where I was happy but didn’t have anything about myself fully figured out yet.
With my campers, I’m simultaneously removed and wholly immersed in my own 15-year-old self. I remember the experience, but my memories are filtered through layers of rosy lenses and hazy transformations. There were a lot of changes between the second year of high school and the second year of college.
The girls are already laughing at me on the first night when I admit to them that I love inspirational quotes. I brush it off, a little jittery—as it turns out, the first night in charge of 15-year-olds is intimidating. The quotes and stories I share are completely unsubtle way of trying to give my campers advice. I leave them with a quote or two every time I take a day off, hoping if I overload them with cliché quips about positivity that maybe one or two will seep in.
My devotion to sharing life lessons with my campers is driven by a deeply rooted understanding that my own 15-year-old summer was one of intense personal growth. That year, I spent countless nights awake long after the rest of camp had fallen silent, lying in a single cot with my best friend as she whispered to me about something she’d barely opened up about before. She had struggled with an eating disorder for years, and as I learned about the challenges she had faced and continued to face, my entire understanding of the world I lived in expanded.
I felt heartbroken, protective, and enlightened at the same time—and I wasn’t alone in my sentiments. My rock through these weeks of hushed, emotional conversations was our counselor Abby. Abby joined in on our talks, became involved in a way that felt safe. She had an uncanny ability to make each of us feel individually loved and wholly supported, on days both good and bad. As I watched Abby handle everything that summer—from gripes about not wanting to swim in cold weather to the personal crisis of a serious eating disorder—I was amazed.
Abby’s positivity and grace under pressure made every day easier, better, happier. She made us smile through it all, and after being a camper in her cabin I went home with a deep, newfound appreciation for the power of a positive outlook. I was acutely changed.
Now, as I step into my own role as a counselor, how could I possibly have the same life-changing impact on my own campers? How could I emulate Abby in a way that feels organic, natural, personal?
The truth is, when I talk to my campers, I see myself. Nerves and enthusiasm and braces and all, I’ve been there.
Everyone wishes they could go back and give advice to their younger self. A pat on the shoulder, a knowing smile, an eye roll or two. With these girls, it’s like I can.
Love yourself. Don’t be defined by the way others see you. Wear sunscreen. Stop stressing about the boy who wrote you that letter. Cool it with the cardigans. You’ll figure it all out one way or another. And if you don’t? That’s OK too.
I hope that what I’m actually getting through to them is more understated than journal quotes doodled in Sharpie. I want to live in a way that lets me be a role model to them. I want them to know how much I care and I want them to find the complex, elusive joys of confidence and self-love that I always found at summer camp. I want to be an Abby to them, but I still want to be myself.
Halfway through the summer, I’m on the phone with my mom. “I’m not sure if I’m making an impact,” I tell her. How do you measure something like that? The girls are busy, running in and out of the cabin grabbing bathing suits and sneakers and sunglasses, friends to everyone and constantly in the middle of conversation. They are blurs of energy and movement. I feel grateful for the moments I’m  able to capture with them.
Ultimately, this is the feeling I’m left with at the end of every day: gratitude. I’m grateful to them for being there, for spending time with me, for showing up. At that point, I was uncertain if I was getting through to them, but they were clearly getting through to me.
It wasn’t just that I was introduced to Austin Mahone, or took every quiz in Tiger Beat Magazine, or learned the optimal hour of the day to post on Instagram. My girls made me understand a new kind of love as they taught me how to put the wants and needs of others above my own.
The end of the summer comes in crescendo: building slowly until all of a sudden, in a tear-filled rush, it’s over. The last songs have been sung. The last laps in the lake have been swum. The last wood fires are burning to ash.
When my campers depart, trailing pillowcases and lacrosse sticks and sunscreen as they re-enter the real world, I open the notes they left for me.
The first one I open reads: “You make me feel so loved.”
Oh, good—she understood.
They continue: “I hope I’ll be like you when I’m older.” “Having you as my counselor made my summer.” “Thank you for always being there and supporting me.”
I’m touched and stunned and filled with love all at once. Somehow, in between the busy days and the journal quotes and the nights spent up late laughing, I got through to them. Giving them back to their hectic lives of after-school sports and SAT prep and 10th grade gossip isn’t easy, but I know that they’ve learned something deeper than any idiom I could ever throw at them. Their summer wasn’t my summer, but it was something better: their own unique development, special and exciting and eye-opening in its own right.
This realization is rewarding and humbling. I can’t help but feel as if somewhere in some time warp, my 15-year-old self is nodding and smiling. Maybe she got something out of all this too.

We’ve all wanted to control the weather at some point. Man may have traveled to the moon, decoded the human genome, and beaten the smallpox virus, but a little rain is all it takes to spoil a picnic, a hairdo, or the Head of the Charles.
A Harvard physics professor named Emory Leon Chaffee 1911 actually tried to do something about it in the 1920s. Chaffee was responsible for “the earliest truly scientific efforts to induce artificial precipitation in this country,” James E. McDonald, then senior physicist at the University of Arizona, wrote in a letter to the professor.
Chaffee knew he wanted to become a scientist from a very young age, according to a 1964 interview recorded by the American Institute of Physics. Though Chaffee, a native of nearby Somerville, Mass., did not come from an academic  family—his father was a pharmacist—he became interested in engineering and science “way back in grammar school.”
Having “always planned to go to MIT,” Chaffee matriculated at the school to study electrical engineering. He soon began to feel, however, that he was stuck at the wrong college, studying the wrong discipline.
“I had a growing feeling that was not what I wanted, that I really wanted to study the fundamentals of science, and particularly of physics,” Chaffee said in the AIP interview. “So, there was no question about what I should do. I was just waiting to get through with the MIT course so that I could go to Harvard.”
After graduating from MIT, Chaffee traveled down Massachusetts Ave. in search of these fundamentals. While studying graduate physics at Harvard, he conducted thesis work that led to the discovery of a novel method for producing long-distance telephone transmissions. Today, it bears his name: the “Chaffee Gap.”
Yet Chaffee’s interests would soon reach greater heights. After graduating and joining Harvard’s faculty—where he would eventually become chairman of the Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Physics—he had a moment of inspiration while chatting with a visiting acquaintance, Luke F. Warren, in Harvard Square in 1921. Offhand, Warren wondered aloud whether it would be possible to dissipate or coalesce clouds by peppering them with electrically charged particles.
Chaffee was struck by the notion, and started working privately on the problem. He soon designed a mechanism to test the idea, inventing and patenting a nozzle containing two cones: an outer, rotating cone and an inner, stationary one. The plan was to place sand in the inner cone and charge it by spinning the outer cone at more than 1,000 revolutions per minute before using the nozzle to spray the now-charged sand particles into the atmosphere.
With the mechanistic details finalized, Chaffee contacted the U.S. Army for help with testing the invention. The army agreed to provide two small World War I fighter planes and allowed Chaffee to use an air force base in Aberdeen, Md. as a test site.
The only obstacle was Warren. After hearing of Chaffee’s work, he’d decided to patent his own cloud modification system. The two scientists’ weather war didn’t make it past the lower atmosphere—it soon emerged that Warren’s application drawings were essentially flawed reproductions of the ones Chaffee had sent him. The ever-modest Chaffee, however, wrote the patent office petitioning to give Warren most of the official patent credit. He only wanted recognition for his nozzle.
In the fall of 1924, Chaffee officially launched his mission to control the weather. The fighter planes, outfitted with the professor’s newly patented sand-spinning machine, flew back and forth above the clouds, spewing waves of charged sand. Yet while Chaffee’s technique seemed to have some effect on cloud formation, he wasn’t able to prove clear causation.
Before more conclusive testing could be done, President Calvin Coolidge shut down the program just two months after its inception. In an explanatory letter sent to Chaffee, the president wrote that “$15,000 [was] too much to spend on such experimentation.”
Chaffee may not have been too upset. He had warned his team at the start that they were unlikely to reach any definitive conclusions.
The nature of the experiment, after all, left everything a little up in the air.

An eerie wind chills us to the bone. The souls not yet at rest gently moan. We stumble upon the occasional late 17th century breastmilk motif. The spirits of the Old Cambridge Burying Ground are gathering in preparation for their 381st Halloween, billowing through this mortal coil like leaves on an autumnal breeze. The dead, clearly, are preparing to declare war on the living. Will Harvard become Howl-vard? Will Drew Faust become Drew… Ghost?
Not if you complete this scavenger hunt.
Find at least 20 disembodied human breasts. Five at minimum must be spewing milk.
“You do see a lot of breast imagery in Puritan carving,” says Caitlin G. D. Hopkins, a lecturer in History and Literature who specializes in New England burying grounds. These images tend to be found as decorative border motifs around the edges of stones erected in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. According to Hopkins, these images became popular because “the catechism in New England was called ‘Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes Drawn out of the Breasts of the Two Testaments,’” and the appearance of the breasts on stones implied a godly source of nourishment. A particularly evocative example of this can be found on the grave of R. Bunker by the burying ground’s large, central tree.
Find three graves that are super, super sad.
“There is a conflict between the theological needs and people’s emotional needs,” Hopkins says. For example, some heartbreaking stones mark the graves of children too young to undergo a conversion experience, and therefore too young in some Puritan sects to be allowed into heaven. Other sad spots in the burying ground include a corner where slaves of Harvard presidents are buried, segregated from the rest of the dead. Also, a wealth of graves from 1740 correspond to a devastating epidemic that swept through the University. It’s a really cheerful place.
Find at least 10 imps, four of which must be carrying coffins. Every imp you find holding an hourglass will additionally count towards your ScaredPlus balance.
“It’s not very subtle stuff,” Hopkins says. In Puritan New England, there was a strong emphasis on the Latin phrase “memento mori,” or “remember that you have to die.” The presence of images like imps, coffins, hourglasses, bones, and angels reminded visitors of their mortality, and of the ultimate goal of entering heaven. Even more intense examples of these images, like a horrifying skull gnawing on its own bones (found on the gravestone of Sarah Revere, wife of Paul) can be found in Boston burial grounds—“the Cambridge Burying Ground tends to be a little more restrained,” according to Hopkins. But a seriously spooky example of an impish grave can be found on the stone of William Dickson, just off a main brick path near First Parish Church.
Other features of the burial ground include the dramatic (and inaccurately placed) stones marking the graves of several Harvard presidents, and a faded marble obelisk, where the portal to the realm of the vengeful dead will be ripped open from the fabric of spacetime in a few days. Godspeed.

It’s expensive to die in America. The trappings of a standard burial add up quickly. Some costs are familiar: the casket or cremation, the service, the hearse. Others aren’t: the embalming fee, the cosmetics, the thick vault of concrete which lines every grave.
These costs typically fall to the living, but they’re also hard on the land. In 2014, The Atlantic reported that the funeral industry buries over 1.5 million pounds of concrete vaults and metal coffins each year—containers which will far outlast their contents. Embalming and cremation aren’t great either. Formaldehyde, a common ingredient in embalming fluid, has been linked to increased cancer risk, cremation to high outputs of carbon dioxide.
Esmerelda Kent, a San Francisco designer who bears an uncanny likeness to “The Incredibles” character Edna Mode, sees her company as a solution to these problems. Kent’s business, Kinkaraco™, sells biodegradable burial shrouds in a range of styles. Her wares have been buried across America, Canada and Australia, from the set of “Six Feet Under” to Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, a certified “green burial” site.
Like most people, Kent’s first ties to funerals were personal. When we speak on the phone early Thursday morning, Kent tells me about a grim election night in 2000. Kent’s mother was dying in a convalescent home. Al Gore was losing on a small TV. When the movers took away the body in a black plastic bag, they saddled Kent with a fourdigit bill just for their service. When Kent tried to arrange a simple cremation, she found added fees at every turn. This experience laid the ground for what would become Kent’s business.
In photos on her website and her LinkedIn profile, Kent has a drama teacher’s eccentricity—large earrings, loose fabrics, and swollen coke-bottle glasses. When her hair’s not pulled back in a soft, Katharine Hepburn bun, it’s up in an old Hollywood turban, like Lana Turner in “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” if Turner had been, as Kent puts it, a “goth kid.” Kent self-identifies as Buddhist, although her particular brand of western spirituality might be best illustrated by its inspiration: a reading of Herman Hesse’s Siddartha at age 15.
When her mother died, Kent was working as a costume designer. She fell deeper for funerea, and took a job at Forever Fernwood, a cemetery outside San Francisco, then one of only three green cemeteries in the country. Oriented away from the costly and toxic methods of conventional funerals, green cemeteries bury a lot of shrouds. Kent found that the shrouds used for burial often wanted design.
“People were bringing bodies wrapped up in shawls and quilts and bedsheets,” she says. “It looked horrible. They leaked and it was a mess. Because I had been a designer, I saw what was needed to cover all the bases.”
The garment Kent cooked up had to be strong— thick muslins, thick silks. It needed handles for carrying, and a board to support the body. It needed to be light, and it needed to be beautiful.
“I used to design for ballet dancers and aerialists, where someone would come out on stage and you had to be able to pull the suit off of them really fast. I’ve been designing for bodies, for different things for years. This was just another thing a body was doing,” Kent says.
Sixteen years later, Kent’s website, an exercise in earnest 2000’s web design (misformatted pictures and fonts with serious serifs), pushes a wide range of products. Under a banner with their motto, “Look beautiful in the last thing you’ll ever wear!™” Kinkaraco offers seven styles of shroud for every income bracket. For the indulgent, the “MORT COUTURE™” line includes soft french silks or black Victorian cottons (The RAVENWING™ goes for $666.00). The nautically inclined might choose the model for burial at sea, while the more modest could go for the TRU-GREEN BELIEVER™, which sells for $299.00. Two styles will make the culturally conscious squirm: The AFRICAINE™, which seems to condense the entire African continent into one tribal pattern and the VARANASI™—yes, a white woman trademarked India’s most sacred city.
All of Kent’s models cost less than caskets (save for the KINKARACO KART™, $3999.00). The self-described “taphophile” says affordability is part of the shroud’s appeal. Another appeal, she argues, is the shift in narrative.
According to Kent, current funereal conventions are relatively recent phenomena—relics of a post-World War concern for preservation, even in death.
“People from that generation had come out of the Depression and then World War II. They wanted everything to look perfect. They wanted makeup on the bodies and they wanted them to be wearing a nice dress and look like they were asleep. They bought their plots pre-need. They paid rent on them like houses,” Kent explains.
Between the Civil War and World War II, embalming gradually lost its social stigma and transitioned from taboo to the norm. The rise of embalming coincided with early cemetery vaulting and a shift in funeral language from words like “undertaker” to the less explicit “funeral director”—all, Kent argues, signs of a culture turning away from realities of decay.
Kent calls her shrouds “realist”—they do less to shield the body, physically and emotionally. Instead of a casket and a concrete barrier, only a layer of fabric separates body and ground.
Corpses are meant “to be put right in the ground to compost,” Kent says. “That’s the nature of the human body.”

Associate Dean for Research Administration Patrick W. Fitzgerald runs his finger across the spines of a vast collection of nondescript volumes in the top corner of his bookshelf. He settles on a slim, drab, dust-colored booklet. Nearly 14 years after the termination of its printed publication, “Principles and Policies That Govern Your Research, Instruction, and Other Professional Activities,” known colloquially as the Grey Book, makes a public appearance once again. “This is something people really don’t refer to much anymore, so I was surprised to see anybody looking into this, and I was surprised you even know about it,” Fitzgerald says.
The Grey Book is a written set of guidelines detailing the complex code of conduct expected of all professors at the University. Specifically, it outlines areas such as conflict of interest, research ethics, confidentiality, and even the amount of time that Harvard professors are allowed to spend on non-Harvard pursuits. The print version of the Grey Book was discontinued in 2002, when it was uploaded to an obscure webpage on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences website. The Research Administration Services department then fragmented this digitized copy of the Grey Book in 2014, scattering its sections across the Harvard internet database. Today, the Grey Book is almost impossible to track down in its entirety, its name lost to Harvard’s institutional history and largely unrecognized by most faculty and students.
One regulation in the Grey Book, that “no more than 20 percent of one’s total professional effort may be directed outside of work,” seems like it would pose a problem for some professors. How do Harvard’s most active professors strike a balance between their activities within and without the fine limits defined by the Grey Book?
Laurence H. Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, finds integrating his out-of-university judicial activities and his teaching easy. “I have not received much conflict in terms of my activities outside of the University,” he says. “I never take advantage of my title as a Harvard professor to gain the upper hand in my pursuits outside of the college.” Tribe, who has argued an impressive 35 cases before the Supreme Court and authored 115 books and scholarly journal articles, feels that Harvard never infringes upon his intellectual standpoints on most issues. He cites Harvard’s policy of “transparency,” the expectation that professors offer information on their webpages regarding their outside activities and opinions, as proof of Harvard’s leniency. “In fact,” he notes, “I consider what I teach to be a rather seamless transition with my activities outside of the college.”
N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor and former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, similarly considers the restrictions defined under the Grey Book rather relaxed. He says, “One thing I always think about is the opportunity cost. One great thing about being a professor is that you really do have a lot of autonomy.” Like Tribe, Mankiw believes that the guidelines outlined in the Grey Book are incredibly flexible. “If you’re writing a textbook, if you’re sitting in your office writing an article for The New York Times—is that a non-Harvard activity? The application of the rule is often kind of murky, and in some sense the rule is there just to give people guidance.”
Thick with chapter upon chapter of seemingly inflexible rules and regulations, the enigmatic Grey Book is perhaps not as rigid as it seems. The different editions of the Grey Book were originally intended to inform professors about new rule changes rather than enforce them. “We try not to be punitive and say, ‘No, you can’t do that,’” Fitzgerald explains. “You can do what you’d like to do, but here’s the way that will conform to the regulations and make sure that you are not jeopardizing your program.”
Mankiw agees. “You have tremendous autonomy to figure out what sort of life you want to lead,” he says. “I view myself as a representative of the university in many ways, and I think the university likes the fact that I’m doing that.”

Bloody Mary,   Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
2 oz. vodka
4 oz. tomato juice
3-5 dashes Worcestershire sauce
1 oz. lemon juice
1 teaspoon of Tabasco and horseradish
1 lit candle
1 ton of courage
We dare you to say Bloody Mary three times in front of a mirror— in a dank Harvard basement, with rats in the walls. A disclaimer: FM is not legally responsible if your eyes are ripped out or if you get trapped in a mirror for eternity.

No inhibition
Seriously, before you kill yourself over whether to stay in Hell or ascend to Heaven, know that Heaven is just a couple of guys sitting around the Ten Man eating pretzels. Bottoms up, and hopefully you’re not sober enough to realize that the guy next to you is probably soaked in perspiration, not Holy Water.

1 oz. Jack Daniel’s whiskey

A friend named Jack
Here’s a solution for when you see your freshman year crush dancing with someone in a sexy hot dog costume across the room. A vital piece of this recipe is Jack, who can: 1. make the apple of your eye jealous and 2. keep you from choking on actual apples as you bob away your sorrows in the tub.
Pumpkin Colada
2 oz. pumpkin juice

Stolen pumpkins
This recipe requires a certain stealth and ingenuity. FM is an environmentally friendly organization, and we know that the many pumpkins sitting on tables in lecture halls, common rooms, and d-halls will eventually end up rotting in the trash. Instead of letting them go to waste, snag them to whip up a Halloween rendition of the delicious tropical drink.

Do you think your house is haunted? Are strange things happening that just can’t be explained? Do you hear creepy noises echoing in the dark? When these incidents are just a little too eerie to ignore, S.P.I.R.I.T.S (Supernatural, Paranormal, Investigations, Research, Intuitive, Truth Society) of New England can help. Just fill out an online form, which requires everything from a description of disturbances to the history of the house, and S.P.I.R.I.T.S. will send a professional team to check out the problem.
“My mother is the one who started it,” Sarah Campbell, an investigator and tech assistant at S.P.I.R.I.T.S., says. “She has always loved the horror, the supernatural.” Before the rise of books and movies that popularized the paranormal world, Campbell explains, otherworldly experiences could seem frightening. “Then ‘Ghost Hunters’ came out, and they basically opened up the world for every ghost paranormal investigator.” After attending a few “Ghost Hunters” conventions and bootcamps, she and her mother decided, “We can do this. We want to do this.” So the pair founded S.P.I.R.I.T.S.
New team members leapt on board in the following years, inspired by an interest in the supernatural and paranormal experiences of their own.
Campbell says the organization’s mission can be boiled down to one word: “helping.” (S.P.I.R.I.T.S. dabbles in some major investigations of historical landmarks—Fairbanks, Fisher College, and the Dean Winthrop House—just for fun.) “Even though the bigger things are primarily what we base our lectures on, we have this whole side of clientele that we are trying to help, whether it be just to confirm [supernatural activity] for them, or sometimes to get rid of what’s in their house,” Campbell says. S.P.I.R.I.T.S. uses techniques ranging from sage to prayers to videotapes to recordings to prove the existence of what Campbell calls “entities.” And the organization will purge them if necessary.

The organization's methods have evolved over the years. “In the beginning, we took a strictly scientific kind of route,” Campbell says. The group used phones and K2s, which register EMFs and measure items that give off electricity, in their investigations. But recently, Campbell says, S.P.I.R.I.T.S. has “come to embrace the more supernatural side of it.” S.P.I.R.I.T.S. has dabbled in portals, energy, and even dousing rods, a type of divination said to locate water.
Campbell is not the type to scare easily. She says, “[Most spirits are] friendly—families who have lived there for generations and generations, and you get the idea that they are protecting the house still. We’ve never encountered demonic spirits. That’s a very rare thing, but there are sometimes entities you encounter that might not have been so nice in life.”
S.P.I.R.I.T.S. approaches missions with a healthy dose of skepticism. “At this point, we all believe that ghosts exist,” Campbell says. “I’ve gotten enough proof. My mother’s been touched, I’ve been kicked, we’ve heard voices, but anytime we walk into a place, we are skeptics that it is haunted. It has to be proven to us.”
“We’ve definitely met people who don’t believe, and we don’t force it on people,” Campbell continues. “We just give you our side of it and let you do what you want with it… A lot of people don’t realize what goes on around them, honestly.” Campbell adds that people typically are rarely judgemental towards the organization; they “think it’s freaking awesome.”
S.P.I.R.I.T.S. does all of its work pro-bono. The organization is primarily a hobby and sometimes a secondary career for its members. Campbell emphasizes the philanthropic foundations of the organization. “When you’re in a house being terrorized by something you can’t see… it’s very scary, it’s very intimidating,” she says. “We just want to be someone that people are comfortable talking to. We want to make them feel comfortable in their house again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 26, 2016, 9:00 p.m.
After months of tense contract negotiations, Harvard will pay its full-time dining services employees at least $35,000 a year and cover increased copayments until 2021—a settlement that union leaders say satisfy their demands.
The agreement was ratified 573-1 by dining services employees at a vote Wednesday afternoon, marking the conclusion of a 22-day strike that has rocked Harvard’s campus and led to the closing of several dining halls and campus cafes. HUDS employees will return to work Thursday morning, though “normal operations” will not resume immediately, according to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
A press release sent Wednesday from UNITE HERE LOCAL 26—the union that represents HUDS—said employees would not see any increases to their out-of-pocket healthcare costs with the contract, which will last five years.The settlement also includes the creation of a Diversity and Equality Committee to “address concerns regarding diversity and equal treatment of Harvard dining hall employees” and retroactive wage increases of 2.5 percent per year—just slightly below the wage increases Harvard’s largest union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical workers settled last winter.
Over the course of the tense, nearly five-month-long negotiations, the University and the union clashed over wages and health benefits for the HUDS workers. The union demanded a minimum salary of $35,000 a year for employees willing to work year-round. Harvard has said that the HUDS workers made an average of $34,000 a year before the negotiations, while the union put that estimate closer to $31,000.
Local 26 also asked Harvard not change health plan offerings for HUDS employees. Eleventh hour negotiations between the two parties Tuesday eventually did lead to a compromise. In the end, the University agreed to cover copayments, while the union accepted a more modest pay raise for dining employees, and both parties agreed to the summer compensation model.
“Throughout this negotiation, the University has sought a resolution that maintains superior compensation for our dining workers, acknowledging their role as integral members of the Harvard community,” deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement.
DeLuzuriaga wrote that the union agreed to changes in retiree health benefits that “will make their insurance plan consistent with all of Harvard’s exempt employees and 5,000 members of other unions on campus.”
Copayments for employees will increase in 2019, according to Local 26 President Brian Lang, though Harvard will field the cost for the copayments with a “flexible savings account.”
“Harvard will protect lower-wage workers from burdensome cost increases by seeding flexible savings accounts and out-of-pocket reimbursement funds through 2021,” deLuzuriaga wrote.
In addition, Harvard will create a new premium contribution tier for employees who make less than $55,000 per year, in which Harvard will contribute 87 percent of the cost of the lowest-cost plan; the University extended this offer earlier in negotiations. DeLuzuriaga said the premium contribution tier will also be implemented in 2019.
According to deLuzuriaga, HUDS employees who work full-time and are available to work during the summer recess will receive a $3,000 summer stipend beginning in 2020. Until then, the University will pay eligible employees $2,400 during summer months, when dining halls close and many dining services employees are without work. The stipends will be disbursed over three payments throughout the summer, according to Lang.
The stipend mirrors a proposal the University put forward in early October in response to demand for summertime compensation.
For employees who work fewer hours during the academic year, that stipend will be “prorated,” meaning it will be adjusted incrementally in relation to the number of hours an employee works, deLuzuriaga wrote.
The agreement also stipulates that the University reimburse dining services employees medical costs, insurance costs, and transportation costs incurred during the strike.
Lang announced some of the details of the new contract Wednesday afternoon to a crowd of roughly 100 HUDS employees and supporters gathered outside the First Parish Church.
“I can report, coming out of our contract ratification meeting, that we achieved every goal without exception,” Lang said to cheers. “It’s a testament to when working-class people make a decision to draw a line in the sand and say, ‘Enough is enough, and we’re not gonna take it anymore.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the summer, Hulu’s Triumph the Insult Comic Dog convened a focus group of Trump supporters and showed them a series of fake Trump proposals somehow even more outrageous than his real plans. While they raise (alarmingly practical) questions—how would you get a shock collar on every immigrant?—they mostly nod and agree with at least the spirit of the proposals. If the idea is delivered in that sneering New York accent, they’ll eat it up! It’s good fun, if rather low-hanging fruit.
The Donald Trump brand is a powerful thing: Even if it’s not worth $3.3 billion, it clearly carries staggering political capital among his supporters. Months before Triumph’s focus group met, Trump had introduced an idea so far from the mainstream that no pollster had ever asked about it—a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. Within the week, Rasmussen released a poll showing that a stunning 66 percent of Republicans supported the proposal. But Trump hasn’t just moved Republicans to the right. Trump has persuaded millions of conservatives who assailed Obamacare, for example, as a government distortion of the free market that international trade has robbed us of our jobs and dignity. He convinced a Republican convention with its harshest anti-LGBT language in decades to nominate someone whose views on gender-neutral bathrooms align more with Hillary Clinton’s than their own. (By the time Peter Thiel gave his speech on the convention’s final night, the convention cheered when he said their new wedge issue was a “distraction from from our real problems; who cares?”) When he suggested we might not defend our NATO allies in Eastern Europe, Trump defenders like Newt Gingrich hailed his foreign policy as a practical, cost-cutting approach, a few short years after skewering President Obama for his inaction in (non-NATO) Ukraine.
But the Republicans’ Donaldic dissonance has wreaked symmetrical havoc on the Democrats’ beliefs. As Trump denounced free trade agreements, liberals suddenly discovered Adam Smith. Between May 2015 and March 2016, the share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who believed free trade agreements helped their family’s finances rose by five percentage points; the share of those voters who thought they hurt their family’s finances fell by six. This shift occurred, remarkably, while Bernie Sanders, and eventually an unconvincing Hillary Clinton, joined Trump in rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
On foreign policy, even the president changed his mind, or at least his rhetoric. Obama rode into office on a wave of anti-interventionism in the wake of the Iraq War. In Jeffrey Goldberg’s excellent article on Obama’s approach to global affairs, he writes that Obama is “the rare president who seems at times to resent [America’s] indispensability, rather than embrace it,” that “'free riders aggravate [him],'” and that he told David Cameron the countries’ “special relationship” would be over if Britain didn’t pony up the military spending.
As often as Donald Trump calls the president weak, his foreign policy platform is based on a similar idea: NATO needs to start paying its dues, or we stop paying ours. As the Washington foreign policy establishment that Obama “secretly disdains” condemned Trump’s words, the president concurred. Seemingly rebuking his own strategy, he called NATO a “cornerstone” of our foreign policy; how outrageous that our sacrosanct commitments would be held hostage!
Trump’s conditional support plan represents, perhaps, a realistic approach to the limits of American power. It represents, alternatively, an irresponsible dereliction of duty from the sole remaining superpower with an aggressive and malignant Russia on the rise. But Democrats and Republicans flipped, seemingly without material changes to justify the flip.
Why? Well, because Trump said it. Trump has so aggressively signaled his position in the culture wars—on deeply emotionally resonant, identity-defining issues like race, gender, and national identity—that he has become the nation’s number one Good Guy for tens of millions of people, and the embodiment of evil for tens of millions more. More abstract policy concerns, like trade and foreign policy, as important as they are, simply do not move people like Trump’s comments on immigrants. Rather than live in a cognitively dissonant world where Trump agrees with some of their ideas and disagrees with others, millions of people are changing their political beliefs to match or oppose him.
Some commentators, like the Economist, see the world’s politics in the midst of realigning from the traditional left-right split to an “open” versus “closed” debate, citing right-wing nationalists’ embrace of protectionism and isolationism. In this reading, Trump’s rise is an effect, not a cause, of ideological shifts. White voters, especially those without college degrees, needed a candidate who appealed to their cultural values without ignoring, as, say, Mitt Romney did, their economic interests. (Ross G. Douthat ’02, a former Crimson editorial columnist, has written some great work on the ideological vacuum Trumpism filled.) As the Democratic Party increasingly comprises urban and coastal residents, on the other hand, their policy positions on trade would naturally become more sympathetic.
But could such dramatic ideological shifts really have happened in both the Democratic and Republican parties since May 2015? More likely, I’d argue, partisans strongly reacted either positively or negatively to Trump from the moment he declared his candidacy, and adjusted accordingly some of their opinions as he took positions. Maybe this putative realignment is just Trump wreaking further havoc on American politics, and when he fades from the scene, we’ll go right back to normal—until the next polarizing figure makes fools of us all.

Harvard students from the Chicago area rejoiced as the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team won the National League Championship pennant on Saturday and reached the World Series for the first time since 1945.
The Cubs defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in game six of the National League matchup to secure their spot. The Cubs lost their first game 6-0 to the Indians in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday, the first of the best-of-seven matchup.
Until now, the team’s lack of success has been attributed to the so-called“The Billy Goat” curse. According to legend, a local tavern owner named Billy Sianis cursed the team after being turned away from a World Series game in 1945 because he brought his pet goat, Murphy, with him.
Several Harvard students eagerly awaited the day the Cubs would return to the World Series.
“It’s huge. This is our chance to win a championship. It’s absolutely exciting,” Myung Suh ’20 said.
John S. Acton ’17 said being a Cubs fan has been difficult and he is happy to witness the team’s comeback.
“The Cubs haven’t been in the World Series for a long time, and it feels a little surreal,” he said. “It would would be incredible if they won, but regardless it’s really cool to see them on the big stage.”
“Even though I have two papers and a midterm this week, I still plan on spending four hours watching each game,” Declan P. Garvey ’17 said, adding that he has been an avid Cubs fan for as long as he can remember.
Nicolas Xu ’20 said the Series provides a great opportunity to bond with other Harvard students from Chicago.
“I actually watched the game last night with a club at Harvard with kids from Chicago in the basement of Lowell… it was great to be able to joke around and talk with other Cubs fans while watching the game,” Xu said.
Part of what distinguishes the Cubs from other baseball teams is the support the team garners despite their lack of success, Damian Richardson ’20 said.
“They have one of the most loyal fan bases in sports who have really stuck with the team through terrible seasons, and to finally have the moment of glory is really wonderful,” he said.
Garvey said he learned valuable lessons from being a Cubs fan throughout years of losing seasons.
“I think it can be viewed as a metaphor for life—even when things don’t go your way, there’s the saying, ‘there’s always next year’,” he said.

Brooklyn Nets point guard and alumnus Jeremy Lin ’10 will donate $1 million to Harvard to help fund undergraduate financial aid and ongoing renovations of Harvard’s basketball arena, the University announced Wednesday.
Lin, who played for the Harvard men’s basketball team from 2006 to 2010, led the team as a captain for the 2009-2010 season and was selected for the All-Ivy League Team three times throughout his college basketball career. He signed with the Brooklyn Nets in July 2016.
In 2012, Lin enjoyed national fame when he led a winning turnaround for the New York Knicks—a run now known as "Linsanity."
“Without question, my time at Harvard prepared me well for success both on and off the court,” Lin said in the press release. “I’m honored to put that same world-class education in reach for deserving students and to support improvements to the facilities where I spent countless hours practicing and competing.”
Lin’s gift is the latest in a record-setting University-wide capital campaign launched in 2013. The Crimson reported last spring that the University had passed its $6.5 billion fundraising goal, and a September announcement put the most recent figure at over $7 billion.
While renovating athletic facilities is not a designated campaign priority, University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson in an interview last spring that financial aid remains a focal point of fundraising efforts. Harvard has raised $460 million toward undergraduate financial aid as of September—$140 million short of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences goal.
“I find it inspiring to see the commitment to financial aid and Athletics that Harvard College and Jeremy share,” College Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in the press release. “His generosity will strengthen the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI), through which more than half of our undergraduates receive need-based grant aid.”
Another portion of Lin’s gift will support renovations of Lavietes Pavilion—formerly known as the Briggs Athletic Center—which was built in 1926 and became Harvard’s basketball arena in 1981. The renovations are on track to be completed by the start of the 2017-2018 basketball season.
Harvard men’s basketball has had a successful streak over the past decade under head coach Tommy Amaker, who has led the team to five Ivy League championships and four NCAA tournament appearances during his tenure. Amaker coached Lin for most of Lin’s time at Harvard.
“I was fortunate to have coached such a remarkable person as Jeremy and I truly believe his commitment will allow us to better serve our campus community, energize current students, and excite future Harvard scholars and athletes,” Amaker said in the press release.

A 22-day dining services’ worker strike officially ended Wednesday after employees voted overwhelmingly  to approve a new contract with Harvard, capping off months of tense negotiations with the University.
Workers could return to dining halls as early as Thursday morning.
The final tally was 583-1 for union members in favor of the contract, according to Carlos Aramayo, financial secretary treasurer of UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining services workers.
Under the new contract, Harvard will pay its full-time dining workers at least $35,000 a year.
With the vote by union members to approve the new contract, Harvard and its dining services employees brought an end to a historic strike that roiled campus, closed dining halls, and drew widespread national attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The historic dining workers’ strike concluded Wednesday with a new contract, but the status of semesterly student-faculty dinners in some Houses remains up in the air.
During the 22-day strike, which forced closures of several student dining halls, many Houses postponed the traditional meal between undergraduates and professors or created alternative events.
Faculty dinners, often ritzy affairs compared to typical meals, replete with table clothes and full service, are an opportunity for students to dine with professors in one of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses. The changes posed by the strike affected the dinners in many Houses.
Currier, Mather, and Adams House all have delayed previously scheduled dinners. Cabot and Kirkland held student-faculty receptions with lighter fare instead of formal dinners.
Some students said they had begun thinking of ways to make up for the postponements, including through the popular Classroom to Table program that funds students to take their professors out for a meal.
“It is unfortunate but we understand the situation," said Currier House resident Karen Malacon ’19, referring to the House’s delayed faculty dinner. “We are also considering doing a Classroom to Table dinner instead because that would be a rough equivalent.”
Not every House changed its faculty dinner plans. Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O’ Keefe wrote in an email that the House’s dinner would continue as planned, with no changes necessary.
One academic program took matters into its own hands. The Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights held a dinner to make up for the absence of faculty-student dinners. An email describing the event circulated over the Currier email list said the committee recognized “that the usual faculty dinners are unlikely to happen this term.  In an effort to be with you during this time, we’re hosting an EMR Pop-Up Dinner this coming Tuesday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We stare each other down, both firm in our standing. I refuse to budge, and you feel the same way. I never signed up for such an encounter, the nature of which, it is true, I underestimated. After all, I had seen you many times on television, and as such had expected a level of comfort and easiness that is nowhere to be found. I contemplate walking away; not once, but at least a couple of times in the few minutes I stand before you. I have to admit, though, that I’m a little embarrassed at this point. We have also garnered quite an audience considering I’ve been stalling those similarly here to make your acquaintance. I’m trying to figure out my options; how to walk away with my integrity whole. Besides, I could really use that bottle of water. So, for the umpteenth time, I push a couple of buttons and smooth my dollar bills, all to no avail, before I decide to exit the arena. Who knew vending machines could be such a challenge?
I see the guy behind me wanting to help, but I guess to assume that I am unable to work the vending machine is ludicrous even to him, which explains his hesitance. Meanwhile, I never anticipated the profusion of buttons. Maybe it wasn’t my fault. I’d like to think it was just that particular vending machine. But, still, I’ll never know: I’ve  systematically avoided all vending machines since.
I’m often asked if the culture shock is real. Given that we live in an increasingly globalized world, I have a hard time understanding what that statement really means. When we think of culture shock, we think of socially awkward encounters, and not being the most politically correct person in the room. Even though I always answer in the negative, lately I’ve been wondering if all internationals temporarily face bouts of culture shock, especially since it can manifest itself in the most unexpected of ways.
Another one of my foreign friends shared a similar anecdote with me as we were laughing over a dining hall meal that we equally don't understand. (Waffles and chicken? Really?). Once, volunteering at the homeless shelter for the first time, she was tasked with washing the dishes—in a dishwasher. The only issue being that she didn’t quite know how to use it. Her pleas for help were met with the snarkiest of looks and she couldn't understand why. Later, to her dismay, she realized that it must have seemed like she had grown up in the lap of luxury, never having had to wash a plate in her life, when, in actuality, she had simply never seen a dishwasher before. It’s true that incidents like these are not what come to our mind when we think of culture shock, but it is definitely one incident that highlights the phenomenon.
On yet another occasion, while I was working at Widener, a lost patron asks me for directions to Pusey, but hesitates when I point him in the direction of the elevator.  When I offer to go in his stead, he laughs and confides in me that he’s never been in one. “Ah, an international,” my heart sings. Elevators were his vending machines apparently. My first reaction is obviously that of the guy standing behind me at the vending machine; who hasn’t been in an elevator? “But, elevators? How?” I wanted to say.  I got swallowed into taking things for granted too. I repress the words just as they are about to escape my mouth, and, instead, I laugh with him and give the reassurance that he is not alone in his experiences.
We, fluent in the ways of our developing countries and their language of manual operation, shared in common our aloofness to staples of the modern world. We, bred amongst the bumpy roads and now accustomed to jolt-free rides, were similarly awestruck by the land of America and its ways. In some aspects, it bothers me to admit the merits of this new place, for it implies that the homeland lacks somehow.
“What’s America like?” I’m asked back home. At times, I respond like a biased parent, willing to overlook my school and its country’s evident advantages and developed-ness in favor of the developing world I love so dearly. “It’s all right,” I shrug, prohibiting myself from forming preferences that do not all tilt in one direction.  Other occasions, I’m willing to criticize the institution: I’m the child who finally sees that her parents aren’t superheroes but loves them all the more for it. I embrace home for its electricity cuts in the scorching summer. I long for the sight of unkempt roads. I feel like my friends and I are constantly trying to be more like that child everyday; we’re allowing ourselves to belong elsewhere, beyond our home countries, and not feel guilty about it. To refer to homes more than one, and not feel a sense of betrayal. And, most importantly, to admit that the new may have merits over the old. So what if we don't come from a world of vending machines and dishwashers? Even though our worlds sometimes collide, and technological advancement is a little too fast-paced for our liking, we’re glad that we’re able to belong to places more than one, and, perhaps, the best part is that they look nothing like.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, a news story in The Crimson exposed an annual tradition of the Harvard men’s soccer team in which team members produce a “scouting report” about the freshmen recruits of the women’s soccer team. In the scouting report from 2012, the members of the men’s soccer team systematically evaluate, rate, and degrade the women based on their physical appearance and perceived sexual attractiveness.
This reprehensible practice reflects a culture of male sexual entitlement, where certain norms and expectations lead some to believe that women’s bodies are for their consumption. The language used in the uncovered document objectifies women, dissecting them into body parts and rating them based on their worth as sexual objects. And this behavior has significant consequences, as it drives sexual assault and violence against women.
This repugnant tradition should serve as a reminder that our campus is not impervious to rape culture. Among the female undergraduate respondents to an Association of American Universities survey made public by the University’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault, more than 72 percent had experienced sexual harassment. And this culture of sexual violence at Harvard is aided and abetted by conversations between men—our own friends and classmates—in which they reduce women to objects of pleasure.
But sexual entitlement and rape culture are not unique to Harvard. Earlier this year, Baylor University was exposed for outright ignoring the many women who came forward as survivors of sexual assault by Baylor football players, because the school was more concerned with preserving its reputation and that of its football team. And outside the collegiate setting, rape culture manifests itself through street harassment, victim-blaming, and rape jokes. The Harvard men’s soccer team's “scouting reports” are symptomatic of a broader culture of entitlement and violence.
Indeed, rape culture is ingrained so deeply in our society that it is trivialized. Sexual entitlement and sexual assault are often dismissed as nothing more than “locker room talk.” Nevertheless, misogyny should be neither accepted nor condoned. Harvard ought  to hold its students accountable for such toxic language and behavior. The Harvard administration has an important role to play here, and it should seek out measures that could combat this culture of sexual entitlement and casual misogyny.
More specifically, these recent revelations underscore the need for redoubled efforts at training for on-campus and off-campus student groups, with a particular focus on fostering respectful attitudes about women and positively creating a campus environment free from misogyny and violence. Most importantly, Harvard should establish real accountability mechanisms.
Finally, Harvard should commit itself to transparency and honesty. Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise may claim—in reference to the recently surfaced tradition—that “this is not a media thing,” but it was the media that brought this issue to his attention in the first place. As the saying goes, sunlight is often the best disinfectant, and the first step to combating these problems is to raise awareness about them in the first place. We know that this problem transcends the men’s soccer team, and we encourage other people to come forward and report to the media or administration if they have had similar experiences.
With greater transparency and greater accountability, we can slowly work together toward dismantling this culture of sexual entitlement and misogyny plaguing Harvard and our culture more generally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Democrats and Republicans have ramped up efforts to sway the large percentage of undecided Massachusetts voters on the contentious charter school ballot question in the days left before the Nov. 8 election.
Question 2, as written on the Massachusetts ballot, would “allow for up to 12 approvals each year of either new charter schools or expanded enrollments in existing charter schools, but not to exceed 1% of the statewide public school enrollment.” In Massachusetts, charter schools are independently run public schools subject to five-year renewal charters. The current statewide cap is 120 charter schools.
The question, one of four initiatives on the state ballot this year, has been contentious and dominated media coverage in the state throughout the past year.
According to data from by The Crimson’s election survey, a questionnaire voluntarily filled out by more 2,000 Harvard undergraduates and to be released in full next week, a plurality—35 percent—of respondents intending to vote in Massachusetts “have not decided” how to cast their ballot on Question 2.
While most Harvard voters are undecided, those who have made up their minds are effectively split. Thirty-three percent of Massachusetts voters intend to vote “Yes” and 32 percent intend to vote “No”.
State Democrats, usually unified on many policy proposals, have debated the merits of Question 2 for months. Mirroring the statewide split among Democratic legislators, the Harvard Democrats, and undergraduate group, officially support the No campaign. But members are divided on the ballot measure, according to Alexander Zhang ’20, the Question 2 captain for the Democrats’ Publicity and Policy Committee.
“We tell members that if they are on the other side they should feel free to put whatever effort they want into the other side’s campaign,” Zhang said.
Despite the schism, members of the Harvard Democrats distributed literature and went door-to-door on Oct. 16 throughout Cambridge, encouraging residents to vote No on the ballot measure. After a phone banking effort a few weeks ago, the Democrats will host another phone bank to garner support, according to Zhang.
“I do think the Yes side is rooted in a lot of concerns with a flawed public education system,” Zhang said. “But I don’t think the solution is to have charter schools and create this competitive system that is inherently unequal.”
Those in the No campaign have argued that increasing the cap on charter schools would reduce funding to public schools and claim that charter schools do little to help low-income areas.
Meanwhile the Harvard Republicans have expressed universal support for the measure, according to Treasurer W. Kent Haeffner ’18, who recently wrote an op-ed in The Crimson on the issue.
“The club is fully in support of question 2,” Haeffner said. “I wanted to make sure that we were putting those opinions out there.”
Massachusetts Republicans, led by Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, have solidly backed the ballot measure, touting successful test scores in current Massachusetts charter schools and claiming that more charter schools would lead to more public education funding.
“We are big proponents of Governor Baker's,” Haeffner said. “The idea of choice and competition, those kinds of things, are very in line with the conservative belief in limited government.”
Statewide polling from Western New England University currently places the Yes vote at 36 percent and No at 45 percent among likely voters, with 18 percent undecided. Research conducted by The Mass Inc. Polling Group shows a similar advantage for the No vote. The ballot measure has, by far, attracted the most spending out of any of the four—as of Oct. 25, more than $26.8 million has been spent on the ballot initiative.
Last month, the Harvard Graduate School of Education hosted a panel discussion on the ballot question. Panelists included Marc Kennen, executive director and founder of the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association and Boston City Councillor Tito Jackson, chair of the city’s education committee.
In September’s Democratic state primaries, incumbent State Senator Patricia D. Jehlen, who represents Cambridge, sparred with Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung over the issue. During the campaign, Jehlen, who is against Question 2, also publicly debated who she called her “real opponent,” the head of Democrats for Education reform, a pro-charter school group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Henry Rosovsky mused recently on current issues on campus, as well as his time at Harvard, articulating persistent problems in academia—including cases of sexual and gender-based harassment, the artificial rankings of higher education institutions, and the challenges of retaining top professors—as well as their current manifestations at the University.
“It always seems inevitable that when you look back, you say, ‘Gee, you know, in my day, things were really much, much better,’ but that’s just a human condition,” said Rosovsky, who during his tenure at the University was Chair of the Economics Department, a member of the Harvard Corporation, and twice the acting University President.
During his time at the helm of Harvard’s flagship Faculty, from 1973 to 1991, Rosovsky said final clubs and single-gender organizations did not seem to have large memberships or even to cross the minds of many students, faculty members, and administrators, in comparison to recent administrative pressure on the social groups.
“I came as a graduate student in 1949, so I’ve seen the place for a long time, and I don’t remember a period where final clubs existed,” Rosovsky said. “I lived in Kirkland House for quite a few years, so it’s not that I was divorced from undergraduate life… But I don’t remember these things.”
In 1984, during Rosovsky’s deanship, College administrators cut ties with final clubs, citing their exclusion of women and, in turn, announcing their status as unrecognized social groups. The Bee, the first female final club, was founded in 1991.
Last spring, the College announced sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations. Starting with Harvard’s Class of 2021, undergraduate members of such organizations, including final clubs, fraternities, and sororities, will be banned from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups. They also will be ineligible for College endorsement for top fellowships, including the Rhodes and Marshall.
Rosovsky questioned the lack of Faculty-wide conversations that took place before the announcement of the new policy.
“I think—this is looking from the outside—my impression is that this policy or change in policy was never discussed on the Faculty, and I don’t know why,” Rosovsky said. “There may be very good reason.”
Twelve professors in May spoke out against the policy, issuing a motion that resolved, “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.” The Faculty is slated to discuss that motion at next Tuesday’s monthly FAS meeting.
Although professors emeriti cannot speak or vote during FAS meetings, they can attend and listen to the discussion. Rosovsky said he would be interested in hearing the different sides discuss their views.
“The questions are fairly obvious, but I mean I assume that ‘the administration’ has thought about these issues and is prepared to talk about it,” he said.
Rosovsky also emphasized how unclear it is whether a Faculty vote in favor of the motion would override the College policy.
“I don’t know what the answer is,” Rosovsky said. “Some people think that if the Faculty votes against this, it has to disappear. Other people tend to—you know, these are administrative decisions. I really don’t know.”
FAS PRIORITIES
Rosovsky also said the current economic situation at Harvard also differs from the financial conditions during his deanship. In the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, Rosovsky said the endowment saw rapid inflation and very little growth—or “stagflation. “ This year, the endowment lost $2 billion.
He added that since current FAS Dean Michael D. Smith assumed the position in July 2007, just as the nation’s financial crisis erupted, the priorities of the job have been very different from that time through today.
“I have a feeling that a great deal of his time has been spent dealing with the consequences of [the crisis]. I didn’t have that particular problem,” Rosovsky said. “Doesn’t mean that we felt rich, but it was a very different kind of situation.”
During his own time as FAS Dean, Rosovsky said he was passionate about growing and developing the Faculty.
“The thing that really interested me about all this was the academic part: the faculty, the quality of the faculty, the quality of education,” he said. “You don’t want to get caught up in all of the administrative, and all of the side issues.”
Today’s professors and administration appear to pay more attention to pedagogy in the classroom, how they teach and what their students learn, Rosovsky said, adding that such careful examination of curricula seems to happens every few years.
PERSISTENT PROBLEMS
Over the past several years, campus dialogue has centered around sexual assault and gender-based discrimination—problems administrators have described as “deeply disturbing.”
Though the specific issues were specific to his time, Rosovsky also described gender-based segregation in Harvard’s classrooms in the mid-20th century. As a graduate student in economics in the 1950s, Rosovsky taught female-only sections of the department’s introductory course, Economics 10: “Principles of Economics.”
“If you were unmarried, the chairman of the Economics Department always assigned you to an all-female section. That must seem a little strange, but it’s true,” Rosovsky said. “Lectures and things like that were integrated, but not the sections. I can’t tell you why.”
In an increasingly competitive market for top professors, universities including Harvard also consistently have faced problematic external rankings of higher education institutions, Rosovsky said.
“I really don’t like rankings,” he said. “I’ve never understood how you can reduce a university to an index number.”
For some administrators, rankings and how they influence professors’ decisions to accept or reject offers, are a cause for concern.
In recent years, many professors and administrators have worried that Rosovsky’s former department, Economics, has lost its top-notch footing. In the fall of 2015, for example, Raj Chetty ’00, a MacArthur Prize-winning economist, traded Harvard’s ivy tower for Stanford’s sunny, buzzing campus.
“I also know that there are these tensions in the Economics Department, with the administration, but I don’t hang around the corridors of power,” Rosovsky said. “I really don’t know quite what all the inside story is, and I’m not particularly anxious to get involved.”
“Unless you are in the seat of power, you never understand what all the pressures are,” he added. “Unless you’re there, unless you have the responsibility, it’s really hard to know what the full story is.”
All colleges, moreover, has advantages and drawbacks for the faculty who choose to teach there, Rosovsky said, and sometimes the differences among schools may be difficult to discern.
“I realize that it’s very competitive and comparative. I do think that when we lose people, as we have, that should be a matter of concern,” Rosovsky said. “Now you know there are all sorts of reasons why people move. I moved here from Berkeley for very good reasons, and that’s fine. In general the thing that really concerns me is the fact that public higher education is under such tremendous pressure.”

For Harvard’s elevators, there are a lot of ups and downs.
Elevators in 15 buildings of 18 The Crimson surveyed around Harvard Yard showcase expired permits. The dates vary based on the elevator—a handful expired last spring, in April or May 2016. But for others, the expiration date stretches farther back. The permit for Thayer Hall's elevator expired in December 2013.
Despite the slew of expired permits, University spokesperson David J. Cameron wrote in an email that “Harvard University is 100 percent compliant in submitting applications for elevator inspections to the State of Massachusetts within sixty to ninety days before inspection is due.”
The Department of Public Safety receives applications for elevator inspections in Massachusetts. Felix Browne, the communications director of that department, said that “sometimes elevators are in compliance but the new certificate has not been posted.”
“When an elevator is inspected for annual compliance, the results are electronically sent to both Otis Elevator Company and to the project manager of elevator services at Harvard’s Engineering and Utilities department, where the information is filed for documentation,” Cameron said. “An electronic version of the certification card is included provided an elevator has passed inspection.”
Maureen McCarthy, the manager of Harvard Yard and freshmen dorms, said up-to-date copies of the permits are in located the elevator services project manager’s office, which would make the elevators in compliance despite expired permits seen inside the elevators.
Many of the elevators have in fact been recently inspected, but do not show updated permits. Thayer and Weld, both under McCarthy’s purview, were inspected this September—both buildings, however, have expired elevator permits.
McCarthy pointed to a combination of “backlogs” in the Public Safety Department and a delay on the part of Harvard and its elevator service company, Otis Elevator, as reason for these discrepancies.
According to Browne, “There are four elevators at Harvard awaiting inspection but since the owner scheduled the inspection prior to the expiration of the certificate the elevators are in compliance.” He confirmed that all elevators at Harvard are “currently in compliance.”
Elevators that show expired permits are in Quincy, Leverett, Dunster, Currier, and Pforzheimer Houses, as well as Thayer, Greenough, and Weld halls. Of the academic buildings surveyed by The Crimson, Sever, Emerson, Lamont, and the Biology Labs also have expired elevator permits. The overflow housing at 20 DeWolfe St. does, too.
Still other elevator qualms have affected students; just this semester, several students were trapped in elevators during blackouts earlier this semester. Milo A. Davidson ’19 was in the Mather low-rise elevator during a blackout when he and his bandmates were trapped for over 30 minutes.
They eventually got out after calling the emergency number in the elevator.
In Pforzheimer House, the elevator to the Bell Tower suite has a sign suggesting that students consider taking the stairs during times of “high volume,” cautioning that the “elevator breaks with heavy use.”
Pforzheimer House Building Manager Mario E. Leon said the “safety measure” was taken after “a pattern” of the elevator breaking on the weekends.

The bottom line: you could either be a fan of mornings or hate them with the fire of a thousand suns—we all know there’s no in-between. Whichever way you may lean, you probably agree with us when we say music can make or break a good day. A good morning playlist is all it takes to get in the mindset to tackle the world head-on. To help you out, here are Flyby’s picks for the best songs to wake yourself up to.
For the early (gym) birdsIf you wake up at the crack of dawn to hit the gym, we have nothing but immense respect for you. Nothing gets your blood pumping like a good workout song, and we can help you out there! Try out Calvin Harris’s My Way, and shut off your mind to the catchy chorus and fast beat. You’ll be nodding along in no time.
For the shower singersSometimes you need to get your groove on in the shower. The acoustics are amazing in there—even if the cubicle is only just big enough for you to fit in it. Even if you’re absolutely tone-deaf, it’s a great way to start the day with a smile. Our suggestion is Shout Out to My Ex by Little Mix. The quintessential girl group pop song, this track gives you the chance to feel great about yourself, hit the high notes and the harmony, and drag that awful ex through the mud while you’re at it.
For your big dayMaybe you have a midterm this afternoon. Maybe you have a performance tonight. Or maybe you just want to carpe diem in whatever small way you can. What you need is a good old-fashioned fight song, and what better way to boost your confidence than Sia literally telling you not to give up? Put The Greatest on repeat, and we promise things will go your way.
For a chilled-out startNot every day needs to begin with a bang. Sometimes you need to take things slow, but groovy enough that you don’t fall asleep in your section. Glass Animals’ Life Itself is the song for you, full of that quirky indie sound and tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Also, who doesn’t need the gentle reminder to “lean back and breathe” every once in a while?
For the morning jamNeed a little something to dance to that isn’t the same thing you were partying to last night? Yeah, we hear you; not every party needs to be relieved the morning after. Give Kult Kyss’s Get Up Boy a try; you probably haven’t heard this Australian artist before, and it’s almost unfairly catchy.
For some wordless cheering-upFar be it from us to restrict must-listen morning tracks to vocal-heavy songs. If you want a mellow instrumental piece to start you off, try Astor In Paris by 3 Leg Torso. Now you can pretend you’re strolling down the Seine on your way to your favorite café, or that you’re doing anything more sophisticated than hurrying to your section.
For the LamonstersAs we come to the end of midterm season, you might find yourself staring at your laptop screen in a Lamont study carrel—even in the a.m. Whether you need a track to help you power through that paper’s conclusion or to celebrate the fact that you’re finally done studying, Nicki Minaj’s Win Again is the song for you. Turn the volume up and remind yourself that you’re a champion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There is no sorrow in all of the world that is not my sorrow,” Hecuba insists as she helplessly witnesses debilitating tragedies unfold in post-war Troy. Her husband killed, her daughters widowed, and her home obliterated, Hecuba is the literal manifestation of someone who has lost everything. In “The Trojan Women,” Director Federico Roitman ’18 attempted to capture the suffering of the women of Troy in their immense post-war devastation. The show served as a reminder of the terrible effects of war on those who survive. Running in the Loeb Drama Center from Oct. 14 to 22 by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, it was as relevant to modern times as it was centuries ago when it was first written, and Roitman’s version certainly did justice to this timeless classic.
Roitman created no ambiguity in establishing the modern context of this ancient play. It began with footage of George Bush addressing the nation at the initiation of the war in Iraq. Scenes of massive American bombings in various Middle Eastern countries followed, and finally the ex-President was shown struggling to respond to reporters’ inquiries after the invasion in Iraq is conclusively deemed a failure. “They started it,” he says, referring to the Sept. 11 attacks, as if the price for the atrocity could be paid by any Middle Eastern country regardless of actual participation in the atrocity. In the context of modern day US intervention and war, Roitman did a remarkable job of bringing home Sartre’s message in adapting this play—that aggressive, hate-fuelled war destroys humanity.
The highlight of “The Trojan Women” was, without doubt, Sumner Perera ’19’s impeccable portrayal of Hecuba. Oscillating remarkably between deep, roaring exclamations and gentle, meek expressions, Perera showed a great mastery over the range and impact of her voice; her frantic movements and tearful, glaring eyes accentuated the impression of a troubled old woman helplessly trying to cope with reality. The death of Astyanax was perhaps the most moving scene of the play; Perera’s acting once again shined through as Hecuba wails at the death of her only grandson, who could have been the savior of Troy.
Kat T. Nakaji’s modest set effectively built a post-war scenario. The dense colors in the set’s equipment and ominous presence of dim blue-red lights lent a dark overtone to the whole setting. Accompanied by the slight background sound of a rainy night next to the gushing sea, the whole setting succeeded in creating an atmosphere of despair. The similarly successful choice of costumes meshed seamlessly into the modern context of the play. Menelaus (Todd E. Jones ’16) donned a full charcoal grey suit while his men are in camouflage army uniforms. The association of the antagonist with modern Western costume accentuated Roitman’s disapproval of Western interventionism that creates more problems than it solves; costume designer Camille Mathieu-Bélanger ’19 was certainly successful in her attempt.
Roitman kept in store a spin that comes as a major surprise halfway through the play. After Hecuba’s soliloquies and the buildup of the characters’ despair, Helen’s entrance introduced comic relief to an otherwise solemn situation. Anna Schuliger ’20, playing the provocative, unfaithful Helen and clad in a shocking pink skirt and high heels, served to change the somber tone of the play as she made comical excuses in front of Menelaus for her elopement with Paris. Her sharp, squeaky voice and her fictional stories alleviated the tension of the play and we even got to see Hecuba in a less menacing mood. “My chastity was my contribution. There is nothing more precious to a woman, you know,” Helen said to Menalaus, expressing her feigned guilt as she tried to convince him that her promiscuity was aimed at helping the Greeks win the war. Some might have argued that this humorous twist feels out of place, but Roitman’s decision to include the comic relief showed that he sensed that without it the play would either become monotonous or would have to be cut short. The insertion of humor allowed the audience some respite and, moreover, left it unprepared for the scene of Astyanax’s death, which brought back the survivors’ terrible desperation with full force.
Roitman’s display of Sartrean influence on the modernized version of Euripides’s play was unmistakable. Existential dread surfaced in each of the victims’ lines. Whether life is worth living anymore once a fate of slavery and prostitution has been sealed became a question of universal concern. Sartre was not exactly a pious believer himself, and therefore his principles of self-responsibility and freedom permeate his adaptation. The gods and their so-called justice were audaciously questioned, and we saw Hecuba lamenting her dependence and belief in them. “Better to rely on my own legs,” Hecuba said, convinced of the futility of expecting wisdom and justice from the gods.
Although the plot does not build much throughout the play, the message it conveyed was timeless and universal nonetheless. Perera’s brilliant performance, Roitman’s humorous spin of Helen’s role, and the potency of the play’s modern setting came together to form a unique interpretation of the devastation left behind by war.

National security expert Michèle A. Flournoy spoke about current and future U.S. national security Wednesday night in the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum.
Flournoy is currently the CEO of the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan think tank she co-founded in 2007. As Under Secretary of Defense for Policy from 2009 and 2012, she was at the time the highest-ranking woman in the Pentagon’s history.
Flournoy began the event with an overview of her organization, urging the audience to look for ways to participate in public service that stoke their passions. Harvard Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison ’62, director of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, moderated the event.
She also spoke about finding ways to serve that bring out people’s passions and said she was happy to see her think tank not only providing ideas to the government but growing the talent for the next generation of public servants.
In addition, she discussed numerous aspects of national defense, including Syria, military technological advantages, military training, and the importance of a coherent and logic information distribution system within the government.
Audience member Mykola Murskyj, a student at the Kennedy School of Government, said he thought that Flournoy’s ideas about better budgetary planning could improve workflow in federal national security agencies.
“The fact that they would actually know how much money they’re going to have 3 years and 4 months exactly down the road, that will help them significantly in knowing exactly what to buy, where they can afford to spread their resources, where they can afford to just take risk,” he said.
Joshua Cohen, also from the Kennedy School, said it could cut down on wasteful spending.
“That would also prevent... $2,000 office chairs in the Pentagon,” he said.
Allison also opened the floor to audience questions during the event, which addressed topics ranging from drone warfare to the military interest in outer space. Murskyj said he particularly liked Flournoy’s response to a question about autonomous warfare.
“I think it was very important that she said what she did about autonomous weapons systems and the fact that she wants to have a human behind every single one, that decisions to kill are going to be made by humans,” he said. “That’s very important.”
Flournoy ended the discussion by saying that while she is sure everyone in the room hopes for a more peaceful world, she believes there are certain challenges that must be met with a credible threat.

Coming off their biggest win of the season at Princeton, Harvard field hockey will now face one of their toughest opponents in No. 12 Boston College.
The Thursday night faceoff under the lights at Berylson Field comes against a strong cross-town foe that has just capped its best finish in program history in the ACC, traditionally one of the nation’s strongest field hockey conferences.
The game inevitably forces the hand of the Eagles, providing an important backdrop before crucial games. Next week Boston College plays No. 1 UConn for its Senior Night and then Virginia in the ACC Championship quarterfinals.
Meanwhile, the Crimson wraps up its regular season campaign against two Ancient Eight opponents in Dartmouth and Columbia. If Harvard can win these two conference matchups, the team will win their first Ivy League title since 2003 and secure a place in the NCAA championship tournament.
“BC is always a great team,” captain Sarah Finnemore said. “[Play] gets competitive, and I think it will be the same this year. We’re taking it one game at a time and we also want to do well outside of the Ivy League.”
Both teams come into the contest with a great deal of momentum. The Eagles have won five of their last six games, including two victories against nationally ranked opponents. The Crimson carries its own share of confidence in the form of an eight-game winning streak, the longest in program history. Both teams will be eager to continue their success, but can’t let the excitement affect their play.
“I think that is something that we have been doing pretty well—staying consistent in how we approach teams,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “Of course, we have looked at video for Boston College, discussing with the coaching staff what the best way would be to play them. I think that they are very similar in a couple areas as Princeton, which is something we were faced with last weekend. So, I think from that perspective, we will come out with the same, or similar, game plan.”
Both teams carry high-powered offenses lad by prolific goal-scorers. Eagles sophomore forward Lucy Lytle leads her team with 11 goals. Harvard’s historic winning streak has been charged by program goal-leader senior forward Marissa Balleza, who has netted 13 goals this season. Both the Eagles and the Crimson are averaging over two goals per game.
“BC will be a fantastic opponent for us to set the pace and get us into the right pace of the game for the last two Ivy League games,” van Herwaarden said.
With powerful offenses on both sides, the game may come down to how well the defenses can handle the attacks. The Eagles have given up 1.81 goals per game, while the Harvard’s Libby Manela has given up nearly a goal less during her eight starts. But with both teams currently on a winning bug, earlier season results may not mean nearly as much.
Thursday’s contest holds extra importance, as it is the annual Coaches vs. Cancer game. Pink apparel will be worn by players and sold to spectators, with proceeds going to the American Cancer Society.
“Being a sports team and getting the media attention that we do…I think that it’s a fantastic opportunity for us to help and do something for the community,” van Herwaarden said. “It’s great awareness and recognition for the real problems out there in life.”
The games are also getting personal for the players and captains, who have invested a tremendous amount over the course of the season. The hope is that physical training and three hour practices will translate into further success.
“I’ve played field hockey since second grade, so I think it’s exciting to be doing so well in my senior season,” Finnemore said.
While Thursday’s game doesn’t directly affect the Crimson’s postseason aspirations, a win entering one of the most important weeks of the year certainly wouldn’t hurt.

A Russian quartet transported an audience to late 19th century St. Petersburg Wednesday evening at the Harvard Ed Portal in Allston.
The concert, organized by the Ed Portal in collaboration with the Ballets Russes Arts Initiative and the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, featured the Rimsky-Korsakov String Quartet, a group that was formed in Leningrad—now St. Petersburg—in 1939. 
“It’s an all-Russian program tonight, some familiar composers, some less well-known, so it should be a really interesting program for those interested in classical music,” said Eva B. Rosenberg, the arts manager of the Ed Portal and an organizer of the event.
The musicians performed various selections from the Silver Age, a period of great cultural expansion centered in St. Petersburg which spanned from the last 15 years of the 19th century up until the Russian Revolution in 1917, according to Anna Winestein, the executive director of the Ballet Russes Arts Initiative.
“The Silver Age was a time of great experimentation and flowering in the visual arts and music, and in poetry,” Winestein said.
Though most forms of art were systematically suppressed during the Soviet era, art from the Silver Age has seen a revival in recent years, according to Winestein.
According to Winestein, “It is seen as one of the great high points of Russian culture historically, and is still an inspiration very much to Russian creativity today.”
The main program included works from Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninov, and Igor Stravinsky. Many in the audience reacted positively to not only the musicians, but also the emphasis on the Silver Age. Concertgoer John Miner, like others, was new to the music from the lesser known composers and to the artistic period.
“I had not heard the composers in the encore. I had certainly heard Stravinsky, Rachmaninov, and Tchaikovsky,” Miner said. “It was very nice to hear Russians play Russian music. I had this trust in them that they were playing an authentic sound.”
Bettina Norton, who said she was particularly fond of the Stravinsky, said the crowd was enthusiastic. “This audience was tremendously attentive, and it just points to the fact that when music is well-played, no matter what your background is, you recognize it.”
According to Rosenberg, this was the Ed Portal’s first collaboration of this kind. She said she hopes to plan more in the future “to reflect a broad audience and a wide portfolio of cultural interests.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A tense, and now public, exchange this month between Harvard Law School spokespeople and the editors of The Harvard Law Record over the publication’s right to print an interview with Law School Dean Martha L. Minow prompted questions about Minow’s accessibility to students and journalists.
When second-year Law students and editors-in-chief of the Harvard Law Record Jim An and Brianna Rennix went into an interview with Minow on Sept. 30, they did not anticipate controversy would follow. They had planned to publish a Q and A with the aim of “fostering frank, substantive dialogue between the HLS administration and the student body,” and they had agreed to do so on the Law School communications department’s terms: conduct an off-the-record interview, then send quotes back to Minow to be approved or rejected for publication.
Many news organizations, including The Crimson, have policies against quote review. But the Record—which An described as “not a training ground for journalists”—followed the administrators’ conditions.
“That’s the game, right?” An said. “You accept stupid conditions for access.”
So An and Rennix were surprised when, after they had conducted the interview and sent Minow’s answers back to her for inspection, Law School spokesperson Michelle Deakin forbade them from publishing any of them. 
“When I spoke of the interview being ‘off the record’ and that any quotes would need to be reviewed by Dean Minow in advance of publication, that was with the understanding that this was an informational interview and that you might develop a story idea or two from the conversation,” Deakin wrote in an email to the editors dated Oct. 4.
An said he felt confused because he thought the editors had abided by the guidelines Deakin had stipulated. While he does not blame Minow for the confusion, An said he felt misled by Deakin and the communications department. In response to the situation, The Record published a sardonic piece chronicling what Rennix described as the “somewhat ridiculous and farcical” series of events.
“It seems troubling to me if people who are in positions of influence at large institutions‚ especially institutions of learning… are not willing to discuss the most pressing matters that sort of face society today. So we just decided that as a sort of miniature protest against the situation we would publish this sort of facetious, silly article,” Rennix said.
In the piece, the Record printed the email exchange with Deakin and the list of questions they asked Minow. After its publication, Rennix and An met with Law School spokespeople and Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells last week to discuss what administrators described as “a mutual misunderstanding,” Rennix said.
Rennix declined to comment on the meeting’s outcome, because she said administrators had declared the discussion off the record.
On Tuesday, Deakin informed Rennix and An that Minow would allow them to publish her answers—with one part omitted—after all.
Deakin did not offer the Record editors any explanation, they said, but she wrote in an email to The Crimson, “When we first saw the Record’s proposed version of the Q and A for publication, we hit the brakes and insisted they not publish it. We were concerned that they intended to post it in violation of the ground rules. That was our misunderstanding. In fact, the editors did follow the ground rules, which we greatly appreciate. In light of the meeting, the Dean agreed to let the Record publish the Q and A.”
The Record editors published the interview on their website Wednesday. In the Q and A, Minow answers questions on a variety of topics, including the gender breakdown of the first-year Law class, affirmative action, the 2016 presidential election, course requirements, and the Cubs.
But while the back-and-forth over the Record’s right to publish Minow’s answers was a misunderstanding between The Record and the Law School communications department, it raised larger questions about the dean’s accessibility and transparency.
An said the goal of interviewing Minow was to give her a chance to respond to Law students’ questions he thought she had not yet addressed.
In a statement provided to The Crimson by Deakin, Minow wrote, “One of the best parts of being Dean of Harvard Law School—maybe the very best part—is interacting with students, which is one of the reasons I've continued to teach each semester, and why I devote as much of my time to meeting with students as I'm able. We're a learning community, and I learn from our students and hope they learn from me.”
Rennix said she did not think the interview warranted the Law School’s initial refusal to grant the Record permission to publish it.
“The interview… is not anything scandalous,” she said.
An thinks people at the Law School are more prone to shy away from publicity compared to those at the rest of Harvard’s schools. Law students and lawyers, he said, are reluctant to take a public stand that might one day jeopardize their chance to be appointed to various legal or judicial positions.
“Among law students and lawyers, there’s a deep deep conservatism,” An said, defining this conservatism not as political in nature, but as “a personal reticence to not necessarily make waves or speak out.”
In a statement to The Crimson, Deakin challenged the idea that this phenomenon extends to the dean.
“Dean Minow is accessible to students on a daily basis,” Deakin wrote. “She meets and speaks each week with student groups, at student-organized events, and with students individually by appointment. She values the importance of being accessible to the editors of The Record.”
"Dean Minow speaks with reporters, students and faculty on an ongoing basis, about all sorts of matters and in a variety of settings,” Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in a statement after The Crimson requested comment from Minow on her interview policy.
“Over the course of her career, she has used a variety of ground rules for press interviews, depending on the focus or subject matter of the interviews. As a general practice, she has favored off-the-record interviews for wide-ranging conversations.  Even in those interviews she’s always made it clear that she will consider requests to publicly release quotes after review, and she has done so many times,” London wrote. “She speaks on those terms regularly with many reporters from around the world, and she has found that they value the opportunity to gain background information and to build relationships that extend beyond one particular inquiry or story."
Harvard Law Record editors declined to provide The Crimson with a copy of the latest email from Deakin granting access to print their September interview with her, citing a new understanding they have with Law School spokespeople. All subsequent communications between the Record and the spokespeople—apart from prepared statements designated for publication—are off the record.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two members of sexual assault prevention and gender and sexuality-based student groups said they were disgusted but not shocked that Harvard’s 2012 men’s soccer team produced a sexually explicit “scouting report” evaluating female recruits in lewd terms.
The document, which appeared to be part of a yearly team tradition in which members rated female recruits on their perceived attractiveness with numerical scores and descriptions, was first reported by The Crimson Monday and sparked concern for the demeaning attitude it revealed.
“[The 'report'] was pretty horrible. I think it was really disturbing to see the sorts of comments that were made,” said Jessica R. Fournier ’17, a co-organizer for anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, speaking personally.
No gender-based identity groups or sexual assault prevention organizations have issued official statements. Several student members of such groups declined or did not respond to request for comment.
However, after The Crimson first published its story, several undergraduates published statuses on social media criticizing the behavior described in the article, and a couple of students speaking in their own capacity said they were distressed over the report.
“When I saw the article, I was disgusted but honestly not as surprised as I'd like to have been,” said Megan E. Sims ’18, an intern at the Office of LGBTQ Student Life. “I wish it were completely shocking that a group of men brought together by a performatively masculinity activity made degrading comments among themselves about women, but I know it's not a new phenomenon.”
Both Sims and Fournier agreed that while they found the report obscene, they were not surprised by the behavior it revealed, with Fournier adding that the fact the comments were made over email suggested students did not feel that there would be repercussions for their words.
“This isn’t just about a soccer team, not just about a sports team, this isn’t about final clubs, this goes way deeper to the culture of this University, and the way this University responds to sexual violence,” Fournier said.
Responding to the document Monday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a statement that he is “always profoundly disturbed and upset by allegations of sexism, because I feel it is wrong and antithetical to this institution’s fundamental values.” Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise also voiced concern, saying it was something the administration should look into and “not a media thing.”
Sims was skeptical of Scalise’s response and insistence that the issue should now be looked into by administrators.
“In reading the original article breaking this story, I was deeply troubled by the comments that this shouldn't be a media thing and should be handled internally,” Sims said. “This of course comes out of a long history of brushing sexual-and gender-based violence under the rug particularly when athletes are involved.”
Also responding to the report, women’s soccer coach Christopher P. Hamblin said that the culture of the men’s soccer program had shifted since a coaching change in 2013. Fournier questioned how much undergraduate culture had shifted within that timespan.
“It was four short years ago.” Fournier said. “From what I hear in most of the conversation on campus about this issue... I would not be surprised at all if there were still groups on this campus that still continued to do the same kinds of things that were pulled in this particular stunt.”
Both Fournier and Sims said they saw this particular incident as proof that increased training and efforts in sexual assault prevention were still necessary at Harvard.
The “report” surfaces during a time when Harvard is grappling with the issue of sexual assault on campus. Two years ago, Our Harvard Can Do Better filed a complaint with the Department of Education alleging that Harvard’s handling of sexual assault cases violated Title IX. The case is still ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every October the arrival of Halloween makes me confront two questions. First, how many king-sized Snicker bars is too many? Second, is there any truth to those stories about lunatics slipping razor blades into candy bars?
The answer to the first question is that there is no answer. The answer to the second question is equally depressing.
A quick glance at 2015 headlines shows that lunatics did insert a range of objects—including razors, pins, needles, and pills—into sweets. No one was seriously injured, but the incidents affected trick-or-treaters. As one article reported, “Mya Ogg, 11, says she enjoys Halloween as much as any kid, but after seeing pills in her candy, she says she no longer wants to go trick-or-treating.”
It’s a logical reaction, and I wonder if fans of Ancient Eight programs not named Harvard, Princeton, or Penn might feel the same way. Collectively they entered the season with their mouths open, ready for a sugary high. Instead, they chomped down on the razor blade of defeat and the sewing needle of remembering that they lived in New Haven.
But downtrodden fans, fear not—the Ivy League season is no more finished than you-know-who’s fifth beer. Teams have played only three Ivy League games, meaning that more than half the schedule remains.
That’s right, Cornell. There’s still hope. It’s Halloween weekend, after all, meaning the one time that Columbia coach Al Bagnoli can dress up as the Penn coach and pretend that he’s joking.
I’m kidding. Well, kind of. Lest we forget, Columbia is 2-4.
Coach Bagnoli, I get your frustration. Really, I do. Sometimes Ivy League football can be a slog, like taking a bus to Princeton at 2:30 a.m. on the night you celebrate your roommate’s 21st birthday. Maybe one of your friends holds a tropical-themed party, and maybe you show up in shorts and a T-shirt despite forecasts for freezing rain. It’s possible that, when you order your Uber, you forget your comfortable sweatshirt at that tropical-themed party. Assuming you board the bus at South Station on time, you might just regret your lack of warmth for the next nine hours—a period that includes a stop in New York City, a mile-long walk through more freezing rain, a sleepless layover in Port Authority a.k.a the Dungeon of Grunge, another bus ride to New Jersey, and another mile-long walk through freezing rain. At least the stadium press box will have hot chocolate and cookies. Theoretically speaking.
I fear that I’ve already said too much. Let’s move onto the picks.
YALE AT COLUMBIA
Earlier this week, the New Haven Police Department added 16 new patrol cars. The brand-new Dodge Chargers replaced a stable of old vehicles, some of which had totaled nearly 140,000 miles. Either that’s thousands and thousands of late-night donut runs, or that’s a lot of crime. You tell me which explanation makes more sense.
All told, the police now boast a fleet of 349 vehicles, meaning just enough to round up all the fugitive students fleeing Yale on foot.
The Bulldogs will draw upon that running spirit Friday when the program’s productive rushing attack (176 yards per game) faces Columbia’s hard-nosed defense.
The Lions may have held Dartmouth to seven points last week in a surprise win, but I don’t expect a repeat feat. After all, following a 42-7 loss to an explosive Penn team, Yale will come out hungry. That appetite alone provides an edge.
Pick: Yale 13, Columbia 10
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
Those students escaping New Haven have a few different options for asylum. Sadly Ithaca, N.Y. doesn’t make the list.
This column has gone to great lengths to point out the difficulties that plague this picturesque town in rural New York—problems that range from a poisonous plant garden to a heroin epidemic, from blocky architecture to Cornell students.
When it rains in Ithaca, it truly pours. Last Friday, for example, nearly three-and-a-half inches of rain—more than an average month’s total!—drenched the campus. Rumor has it that optimistic students abandoned their classwork, knelt in the flooded streets, and began to pray fervently. Finally the apocalypse had come; their Cornell education was over.
Ah, but not yet. After every Biblical rainstorm comes a day of sunshine—meaning another chance to see Ithaca in the light. Sometimes life is a fate worse than death.
That adage applies beautifully to this weekend, when Princeton football will travel to Cornell after a heartbreaking loss to Harvard last Saturday. A word of advice to zookeepers everywhere: Never mess with an angry tiger.
Pick: Princeton 42, Cornell 17
HARVARD AT DARTMOUTH
In recent days, a different kind of beast has tormented the Dartmouth campus. Yes, the bears have arrived.
In this case, a mama bear and three cubs have launched a series of increasingly brazen attacks against ice cream saucers and Goldfish cartons.
Hanover partisans—all three of them—will be quick to note that the last bear fatality in New Hampshire occurred in 1784, meaning before the HUDS strike began. Some students have even greeted the ferocious predator with enthusiasm. “It was like watching Planet Earth,” one said. “It was great.”
This Saturday, when Harvard takes on Dartmouth, spectators might expect to see another Planet Earth staple—the mauling of a small agile animal by a larger predator.
Indeed, the Big Green has started Ivy play 0-3, with losses to Penn, Yale, and Columbia. Yet all these games have been competitive and provided a chance for Dartmouth’s young defense to grow.
Moreover, we shouldn’t forget recent history. Last year the Big Green suffered tragedy in a 14-13 loss to the Crimson. That defeat certainly still stings, and on its homecoming, Dartmouth will come out with fire.
Subtly this matchup is the most unpredictable of the weekend. I have a better chance of surviving a bear attack than picking the right score.
Pick: Harvard 24, Dartmouth 20
BROWN AT PENN
Apparently zany news stories proliferate in the Ivy League, but one in particular stands out: the case of the “bad monk” at Penn.
Earlier in October, a rogue student sent 60 emails to the inboxes of nearly 2,400 people. That’s a huge dump of information, equivalent to Isa DeLaura’s limerick at Grand Elections. No joke, the perpetrator was taking a course called “Wasting Time on the Internet.” Here at Harvard at least we call it General Education.
The twist in this story brings to mind the plot of The Hangover Part II. It turns out that the serial emailer was taking a Religious Studies class nicknamed the “monk class,” an offering that required a month of asceticism. So the one person capable of unwinding this email fiasco is undergoing a vow of silence.
On Saturday Penn football will hit Brown with the force of 144,000 emails. After dropping two non-conference contests to start the season, the Quakers have won four straight. No one can run with junior wide receiver Justin Watson, senior quarterback Alek Torgersen has thrown 12 touchdowns versus two interceptions, and the defense is fearsome.
Expect a demolition that will shock even the most loyal Brown fan into a vow of silence.
Pick: Penn 42, Brown 10

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team has emerged victorious against Ivy League rival Dartmouth just once in the past six seasons. This span, characterized by three close overtime games, has seen the Big Green (5-3-5, 3-0-1 Ivy) take home at least a share of the Ancient Eight title three times. After last season’s clash between these teams effectively solidified Dartmouth’s league title, the Crimson look to get even and take sole possession of the conference’s top spot in this weekend’s matchup.
The Crimson (8-3-2, 3-0-1), having recently concluded its non-conference play this past Tuesday with a 2-1 double-overtime win at New Hampshire, has been surging of late and finds itself tied atop the Ivy League standings with none other than its weekend foe. With just two conference games remaining after this head-to-head, these two teams are looking to make a final push at the end of the season to give themselves the edge in the Ancient Eight.
“We try not to look into the other team too much,” senior defender Alex Leondis said, “but obviously we know it’s a big Ivy League game. After last year, with them beating us and clinching [the conference] title, there’s a little bitter feeling in all of us.”
The Harvard squad has not lost a match since mid-September and is presently riding a five-game win streak. Dartmouth, on the other hand, has rebounded nicely from a rocky 1-2-5 opening half of the season by posting four wins in five games. The two teams seem to be hitting their strides at the right time, and high-quality soccer from both sides will surely converge in Hanover on Saturday afternoon.
Major contributions from underclassmen have been crucial to the Crimson’s recent outpouring of favorable results. Of particular note are sophomore forward Cesar Farias (2G, 2A) and freshman midfielders Matthew Glass (4G, 2A) and Taner Dogan (2G). Dogan, the reigning Ivy League rookie of the week, has netted goals at opportune times during Harvard’s current win streak, and Farias and Glass have been steady contributors all season.
“From freshmen to seniors, we all hold each other accountable,” Leondis said. “Recently the younger guys have been awesome…. The game plan now for the young guys is to get better each day.”
Compared to the Big Green this season, the Crimson has played an attacking, high-pressing style of soccer, as evidenced by its goals for and against numbers: Harvard’s 1.86 goals per game are no match for Dartmouth’s 1.23; conversely, its 1.30 goals against average makes the Big Green’s 0.85 GAA appear downright stingy. In short, more high-impact events tend to occur as a result of the Crimson’s pace.
“This year the freshman class has been really dynamic…. It’s taken a little bit off the shoulders of the older guys,” said Harvard junior forward Tyler Savitsky. “We’re looking to put Dartmouth under a lot of pressure, and that’s something we really pride ourselves on.”
Through 14 games this season, the Crimson has netted 26 goals—good for second in the Ivy League—in fewer shot attempts per game (11.1) than Dartmouth has needed (12.3) to tally a middling 16 scores, speaking to the efficiency of the Harvard offense. This productivity can be attributed in part to Crimson senior forward Jake Freeman, whose seven goals and 19 points place him in the upper echelon of Ancient Eight scorers, and a cast of other significant contributors including junior midfielder Christian Sady (3G, 5A) and junior defender Justin Crichlow (5A).
On the other side of the pitch, the Big Green’s offensive attack seems to rely heavily on balance, as six players have contributed similar point totals so far this season. Sophomore midfielders Noah Paravicini and Justin Donawa lead this cluster of offense-suppliers with three goals and two assists each.
Harvard has performed particularly well against Ivy League opponents this season; the lossless record speaks for itself but nevertheless is accompanied by a host of supporting statistics. Against conference foes, the Crimson’s shot percentage has jumped to .220 from its season average .167, and similarly, the team’s shot-on-goal percentage has incurred a nine-percent increase. Harvard’s augmented shots and goals per game—not to mention its sharp reduction in penalty bookings—also define this trend of Ivy League success.
“I think the biggest thing is the…commitment to fight every minute, no matter what the scoreboard says,” Leondis acknowledged. “There’s no quit, there’s no stopping in the group…. We’ve been working and fighting for each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Asian American students is planning to protest the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ upcoming production of “The Mikado” for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera.
Organized by George S. Qiao ’18, the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists, describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the Japanese stereotypes and appropriation of Japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted production’s storyline. But later Qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the Players.
“I fully believe that members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players put their blood, sweat, and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production,” Qiao said. “However, I believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement [with] this play’s history of Japanese cultural misrepresentation.”
Penned in 1884, “The Mikado” is a comical opera, set in the fictional Japanese town of Titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of British political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated “Asian” names and stereotypical cultural caricatures.
In recent years, productions of the opera across the country have been dogged with controversy over the script’s treatment of Asian culture. Hoping to avoid these issues in their own production, the board of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera, characterizing their rendition as a “reimagining” of the original production.
“The board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, whose mission is to produce the full canon of Gilbert and Sullivan’s shows, faced a dilemma this past January,” Kathleen C. Zhou ’17, the president of the Players, wrote in an op-ed for The Crimson Tuesday. “Strike ‘The Mikado’ from our season, and ignore one of the most problematic but well-known G&S; shows, or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent.”
The setting of their show is no longer the 19th century town of Titipu, and instead is now 20th century “Las Vegas themed Oriental hotel.” And, the opening number “Gentlemen of Japan” has been rewritten as “Gentlemen of the Strip.”
At the same time, some controversial parts of the original script have still made their way into the Players’ adaptation, including the song “Mi-Ya Sa-Ma.”
Zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical opera’s script, the complete omission of all of the original production’s issues was “an erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to [Asians].”
Instead, the Players decided to keep some aspects to “expose the absurdity of the traditional show.”
“Part of what makes this show’s ignorance so apparent is how ridiculous it is,” Zhou added.
Qiao, however, said that he felt the version of the play he saw Wednesday evening “avoided racial issues altogether,” pointing to the fact that he did not recall hearing the word “Japan” once during the entire production.
“It’s not necessarily bad, but I believe that any attempt at reinterpreting “The Mikado” has to critically engage with race,” he said. “And this production does not critically engage with race.”
He added he thought certain productions of “The Mikado” have successfully managed to deal with the opera’s controversial history, naming “The Mikado: Reclaimed” as an example.
“While I recognize that this is very difficult to do, especially as a student-run company, I don’t think it’s impossible,” Qiao said.

Saturday, Sept. 24, 2016:
A girl stands at the front of the school bus, holding two sheets of 8x11 paper. “We all know why we’re doing this today,” she announces, brandishing one sheet in her left hand. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren’s smiling face peers out at us all. “We’re doing it for this woman.” The crowd cheers.
The girl retracts the photo, and replaces it with the sheet in her right hand, a photo of Donald Trump. “We all know how we feel about this man.” The crowd nods.
A girl with a blonde French braid and clear-framed glasses speaks up. “I hate him,” she says. “I hate him.” The bus takes off and rumbles through Cambridge.
The Harvard Dems are on a canvass trip to New Hampshire, and I’m tagging along. My editors have asked me to track the election as it plays out across campus for the next month. They wanted someone “impartial.”
(Who’s impartial, in this election? I’m Canadian, so I can’t vote. If I could vote, I’d vote for Hillary Clinton. But I can’t vote.)
At 10:30 a.m., the bus rolls to a stop in downtown Nashua and the Dems pour out, forming a raggedy line in front of the Nashua Democratic Party headquarters. I choose two people at random—Devontae A. Freeland ’19 and Alexandra Shpitalnik ’19—and tag along on their assignment. 
Elizabeth Warren makes a cameo and shakes everyone’s hand.
A flannel-clad, van-owning man named Jeff picks us up at HQ and drops us off in a suburban neighborhood a little north of Nashua. The crosswalks are cherry brick, embedded neatly in the wide smooth roads. The houses are large and new and far apart. The residents are overwhelmingly white and retired.
The Dems begin to knock. Few people have heard of Colin Van Ostern (aspiring governor). People are split on Maggie Hassan (current governor; aspiring senator). Almost everyone is voting for Clinton. The day passes quickly.
By the time I climb back on the bus, I am almost certain that Clinton is going to win. How could she possibly lose? 
***
John Della Volpe is the Director of Polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics.
Laura E. Hatt: There is a stereotype that millennials don’t vote, that they aren’t politically engaged. How true is that?
JDV: Young people don’t vote. That’s in large part true. Less than one in two people between 18 and 29 who are eligible to vote actually show up. 
It doesn’t mean, though, that they’re apathetic. The reason that they don’t vote is because they have little faith or trust in the system, in the political establishment, that their vote will make a tangible difference. They prefer to find other ways to make their community and their country better, mainly through volunteerism.
LH: What about college students?
JDV: When I look at the college voter, clearly they are more likely than the average 18 to 29-year-old to vote. Something like 45 percent of all 18 to- 29-year-olds will vote on Nov. 8. You might have 55 or 60 percent of college students vote.

Monday, Sept. 26:
Plan A—The Institute of Politics Debate Screening
“Let’s GOOOO! We’re CLOOOOSED,” yells the security guard standing in front of the Institute of Politics. His arms are crossed and his expression is sour. It is 8:09 p.m. The first presidential debate begins in 51 minutes, and the IOP is already full.
“This fucking sucks,” says a man in a suit. 
It does suck. At least 40 people are milling about the sidewalk in front of the building; groups are splitting off and others are arriving every few minutes. The IOP debate screening has been widely publicized, and it seems like half of Cambridge has shown up.
I raise my chin and approach the guard. “I’m a reporter for the Crim—” I say.
“I’m going to have to ask you to leave,” he says, stepping right up in my personal space. I look him in the eye for three long seconds before I shrug and turn away. 
Plan B—“Government 1359: The Road to the White House” Debate Screening
I reach the Science Center at 8:50 p.m., just in time to catch the end of The Road to the White House lecture and watch the room shift out of “class” mode.
The guy on my right slips out to pop popcorn, and the group to my left unzips their backpacks to reveal jumbo bags of candy corn and steel bottles of hard apple cider. Other students trickle in. The ambient noise rises. At 8:59 p.m., we count down together.
At 9 p.m., the debate begins.
Clinton strides onstage first. Her pantsuit is glaringly red. The Science Center erupts in gleeful approval, matching, then drowning out the studio audience.
Next, Trump emerges. The studio audience continues to cheer. In the Science Center, the applause peters out and dies. Someone boos.
The candidates take their place at the podiums and, for the next 90 minutes, proceed to tear each other apart. Clinton attempts to coin the phrase “Trumped-up trickle-down economics.” (The Science Center rocks with laughter.) Trump accuses Hillary of causing the Recession. (The Science Center is silent.) Clinton brings up the tax returns. (The Science Center cheers.) Trump brings up the emails. (The Science Center is silent. The studio audience loses it and Lester Holt has to stop the debate to lecture about respect.)
At 10:45 p.m., Gov 1359 lecturer Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo mutes the commentary and strides onstage. “Does anyone have any questions?” he asks.
A girl near the front raises her hand. “How is this a choice?” she asks, laughing.
Díaz Rosillo frowns. “Of course it’s a choice,” he snaps.

Elena Sokoloski ’18 is a junior Government concentrator and a phonebank organizer for the Harvard Dems. She has worked for the Ohio Democratic Coordinated Campaign.
LH: How do you watch the presidential debates?
ES: I’m in the Harvard University Band, so a bunch of us get together and watch them in the band room. Most of the band is liberal but I don’t know if that’s relevant—it’s just a very liberal group of students here. 
LH: Who do people root for?
ES: Some people are very partisan, very much in favor of Hillary. Most of them are not partisan and were just standing back watching like, “Wow, Donald Trump… looks so creepy right now.” It had nothing to do with his policies. They were just watching the spectacle.
LH: Does anyone root for Trump?
ES: There is one person who doesn’t support Trump, necessarily, but makes sure that we aren’t being unfair to him. When somebody would call Trump out for something that he said, this kid would explain, “Actually that’s what he was going for. He was going for this thing.” And we said, “Oh, that makes sense.”

Friday, Oct. 7:
At 4:02 p.m., David Fahrenthold, a former Crimson editor, of the Washington Post shares his article on Twitter—“Trump recorded on hot microphone having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005.”
At 10:21 p.m., the Harvard Republican Club posts on Facebook: “Donald Trump is immoral. He is disgusting. He is unworthy of the highest office in the land.”

Saturday, Oct. 8:
It’s 9 a.m. on a Saturday—exactly two weeks after my canvass trip with the Dems—and I’m standing outside Quincy House in comfortable shoes, waiting to join another undergraduate political organization on a canvass trip to New Hampshire. I am hit by a wave of deja vu.
This time, though, two details are different. One: I’m canvassing with the Harvard Republican Club. Two: We’re not campaigning for a presidential candidate. After all, the Republican Club has refused to endorse Trump since Aug. 4, 2016, when it denounced Trump as “a threat to the survival of the Republic.” Its Facebook announcement has accumulated more than 133,000 shares and 189,000 likes to date. 
Nope, we’re not traveling to Milford, N.H. for Donald Trump. We’re going for incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte.
“We don’t think either one of the candidates is going to be a good president, so we’re focusing on races like this one,” Republican Club treasurer Kent Haeffner ’18 says. “The president is going to need a strong Congress to stand up to them. We’re focused on the big picture.”
Unfortunately, “big picture” canvassing is a bit of a tough sell: Only four Republican Club members and an Ayotte organizer are here.
The Ayotte organizer briefs us as we drive. Apparently, Ayotte is a strong opponent of the Keystone pipeline. She plans to crack down on the opioid crisis. She misspoke last week when she said she would “absolutely” consider Trump a role model for children. The last bit of briefing is the most awkward: Ayotte has not yet taken a firm stance on Trump, and it’s not clear that she will.
By 11 a.m., I am standing on the shoulder of a one-lane country road in rural New Hampshire. The earth slopes away to either side of the road, merging with the hilly pastures below. Haeffner and J. Miguel Undurraga ’19 walk quickly, and I have to scurry to keep up.
A few houses in, Haeffner excuses himself to take a conference call. When he returns, he is bubbling over with excitement. “Miguel! Miguel!” he shouts, waving one arm and beginning to jog. Undurraga turns to look. Haeffner yells the news: As of 11:37 a.m., Ayotte has refused to endorse Trump.
“I’m a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,” Ayotte wrote in a statement announcing her decision. “I will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and instead will be writing in Governor Pence for president on Election Day.”
Haeffner and Undurraga are jubilant. They scour Twitter, rattling off every senator and governor who has denounced Trump since last night’s scandal and hypothesizing who will be the next to go. “Twenty-four hours ago, this was a different race,” Haeffner says. #NeverTrump Twitter is going wild.
By mid-afternoon, every female Republican senator but one will withdraw her support.
Around 1:30 p.m., the Ayotte organizer picks us up and takes us to the Milford House of Pizza. I slide into a booth with Undurraga and a group of other Republican students from Dartmouth and Babson College, including Alex, a Dartmouth senior. 
Unlike Haeffner, Undurraga, and most of the Harvard Republican Club, Alex supports Trump. Also unlike the Harvard Republican Club, Alex is not a longtime Republican. “I’ve actually identified as a Democrat until recently,” Alex says. “But I feel like the Democratic Party has moved too far left and is too focused on social issues and racial issues and not really focused on the economy.”
Undurraga looks shocked. “But you feel comfortable voting for someone from either party, right?” he says.
Alex shakes his head. “I don’t feel comfortable voting for a Democrat right now,” he says. “The Republicans, at least they have a conscience. A lot of them were reluctant to support Trump. Whereas, I never heard any Democrats come out and have second thoughts about Hillary. Do they care at all about character and integrity?”
Baffled, I look to Undurraga for guidance. He has edged all the way back in his booth and is gazing intently at the table, ignoring his co-canvasser as best he can.

Sunday, Oct. 9:
The second presidential debate hardly makes a dent on campus. It’s Columbus Day weekend, after all, and many students have gone home.

Alexander J. Cullen ’18 is a junior biomedical engineering concentrator and secretary of the Harvard Republican Club. On Oct. 4, 2016, he published a controversial op-ed in the Crimson titled “In Defense of Donald Trump.” On Oct. 10, three days after the Washington Post leaks the Trump tape, we meet in Harvard Yard.
LH: Why did you decide to write the op-ed?
AC: I know that my perspective is not popular, and I don’t have any shame in that. I wanted to get it out there so that people actually have something to contemplate that they wouldn’t receive otherwise at a campus like Harvard.
LH: Did you experience any kind of social backlash?
AC: Within the Republican Club, my position of being a Trump supporter is not super popular on the board. I’ve taken a little bit of silent flak for it—an unspoken disapproval.
LH: Do you know other Trump supporters on campus?
AC: I’m more of, not a loner as a Trump supporter, but a loner as someone who’s become more active and more verbal about being one. There are a couple people who, not naming any names, but they’ll talk to me. They might not be as ready to support Trump, but they’ll definitely say pro-Trump things and negative anti-Hillary things. They just won’t come out and say it publicly.

Saturday, Oct. 15:
I wake up in Brooklyn, in the bony bunk bed of a second-floor walkup “hostel” in East Flatbush. I leave at 9 a.m., ignoring the thick layer of white powder (baking soda?) that has accumulated on the stairs overnight.
I’ve left campus this weekend to track down Harvard students taking time off to work on political campaigns. I figure they must have some kind of special understanding of the election, some kind of exceptional insight. You don’t just do this—put your whole life on hold, graduate off-cycle, pack up your stuff and move to New York—on a whim, right?
My first interview is in Brooklyn Heights, at 10 a.m.

Sarafina J. Chitika ’18 is a Biomedical Engineering concentrator who’s currently taking the semester off to work as a full-time digital marketing intern at the Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.
LH: How did you get involved in politics back on campus?
SC: I don’t really do politics at Harvard. Once, I got in an argument about politics. This girl was like, ‘You should be on the debate team. Why don’t you do debate?’ Uh, because people who like to argue for fun are the worst.
I try to hear different people’s opinions. I think when people are really involved in politics—and this is a terrible thing to say because now I’m really involved in politics—when they’re really a known IOP or Dems person, they’re just point-blank not able to have the same conversations with people. I think there’s a culture of judging people for their political groups. Campus is obviously very, very liberal, in a very aggressive way. I just wasn’t interested in being part of that conversation.
LH: So why work for Hillary?
SC: The media coverage kind of drove me to get involved in the campaign because I felt like it was so gendered. In [Women and Gender Studies 1225: Leaning In, Hooking Up: Visions of Feminism and Femininity in the 21st Century] we spoke a lot about caricatures, and when I turned on the news I saw it: an untrustworthy powerful woman. I’m tired of the caricature. It’s old and it’s tired. Electing the first female president? It’s about damn time. 
LH: How does digital marketing affect the campaign?
SC: We do all the paid digital advertising—the Facebook advertising and Twitter advertising and Snapchat advertising. [You have to understand] the extent to which data is being used to make sure we’re giving these ads to the right people. We’re not going to pay to send an ad that says “register to vote” to a 45-year-old white man. He’s probably already registered to vote. We’re targeting these ads towards certain demographics to make sure we’re reaching people in the most effective way.
LH: Which demographics do you target?
SC: We’re looking for the people who are likely to vote for us [but] are a) not going to turn out or b) going to vote for a third party candidate. Millennials are a big target demographic for us. Also independents, swing voters, moderate Republicans. We’re far more interested in those people.
The campaign isn’t concerned about Trump supporters, because at the end of the day they’re going to support Trump. He could walk down on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and his supporters would be like “Second Amendment rights!” and they’d stand by him. If you support Trump, you’re never going to support Hillary.
LH: Have you met a lot of Trump supporters? Do you feel like you understand them?
SC: Have I met a lot of Trump supporters? No. I have Republican friends, back home, but I don’t have Trump supporter friends.
I live in Currier House, and Currier House put Donald Trump in our Housing Day video. A lot of people of color were really offended, but there were some students in the House that were like, “Oh, it’s just a joke. It was meant to be satire.” That was the moment I realized that being able to laugh at Donald Trump is a product of your privilege. You think he’s funny because you’re not going to be the one getting deported.
That’s when it really hit me that, as liberal as Harvard is, a lot of people write Trump off. I think they really underestimate the undercurrent of tension in this country, and how powerful he is.

Saturday, Oct. 15:
Chitika guides me through the Clinton campaign headquarters. The walls are plastered with slick “I’m With Her” posters and nubbly “Stronger Together” flags. A 10-foot “H” covers an entire wall. A tiny pumpkin announces “IWillVote.Com” in black Sharpie. Twenty- and thirty-somethings in casual dress hunch over low desks as far as the eye can see. The air ripples with gentle keyboard sounds. Chitika is visibly proud.
I take Chitika’s photo in front of the giant “H.” She asks me to send it to her, and she posts it on social media with the caption, “So my daughter knows she can be president.” It gets 250 likes on Instagram and 281 likes on Facebook.
By lunchtime I am back on the bus.

Gwen R. Thomas ’17 is an English concentrator, a former Crimson business editor, and the former president of the Harvard Republican Club. She is taking the semester off to intern for the Google Election Team, a bipartisan digital marketing agency in Washington D.C.
LH: Google Election Team is a bipartisan service, but you’re a Republican. Do you cross party lines?
GT: Google asked us, “What team are you on?” I work with Republican clients and the Dem interns work with Dem clients. Of course, we’re firewalled from each other. It wouldn’t be good if the same person working on Hillary’s campaign is the same person working on Trump’s campaign. It’s all down-ballot candidates—like I said, Super PACs and things like that.
LH: It seems like this job has a business side and a politics side. Which are you here for? 
GT: I was definitely interested on the politics side. I did Crimson business, I did business and advertising, but I was excited about politics and understanding the back end of campaigns. How do you get your name recognition up? How do you get your voters to come out to the polls?
LH: So why not work on a campaign directly?
GT: [If I wasn’t working at Google,] I think I would have preferred to [continue as] president of the Harvard Republican Club, if only because the opportunities to volunteer and run the club and engage there would have been wonderful. I could have left to work on a campaign, but I also could have stayed to help other people get super engaged in campaigns.
LH: Are Harvard students politically engaged?
GT: When I think of Harvard, I think of the times when I would sit at Lamont [with my friends], we would see something in our newsfeed, and all my friends would start talking about it. In a lot of other places, maybe young people don’t sit around talking about politics, but I’ve always found that people are very willing to engage at Harvard. People don’t shy away from these serious discussions, and people don’t lose friends. In some ways, it is homogenous, for sure, but that makes it interesting when I ask people why they all feel the same way.

Sunday, Oct. 16:
Thomas guides me through the Google office on my way out. Unsurprisingly, the space is sleek. The lounges are stocked with large fridges and even larger cappuccino machines. The nap pods (remember that terrible Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson movie/marketing ploy “The Internship”?) are real. I type my parent’s home address into a computer and the walls around me come to life, a 24-square-foot 180-degree Google Maps.
Thomas is sleek, too. Calm, polished, thoughtful. About 10 notches less exuberant than Chitika. In fact, it’s not until I’m halfway back to Boston that I realize I didn’t learn anything about her politics. Why is she here? Which campaigns does she handle?
Who is she going to vote for?

Wednesday, Oct. 19:
It’s the evening of the third debate. Having learned my lesson, I arrive at the IOP with a plan—the Republican Club has booked a private screening in the FDR room, and I’m invited. 
I scuttle inside and nab a seat at the table. Only a few Republican Club members are here so far. They tap away at their laptops in relative silence. The minutes pass slowly until I notice the patriotic mini-cupcakes scattered about and slip out to investigate.
As it turns out, the FDR room opens directly onto the JFK Junior Forum, where a crowd is watching on a larger screen. I spot a friend in the crowd and sit down with her.
“Look at that pantsuit!” my friend hisses in my ear, pointing to the scene being projected above us. Clinton emerges from her SUV, dressed in blinding white. “She looks so presidential.”
The opening comments begin and I scurry back to the Republican Club’s room. As I enter, someone points at Clinton. “Look at that pantsuit!” she says. “She looks like a bedsheet.” Laughter ripples among the 15 or 20 people in the room.
I begin to get nervous. I’ve never really heard anyone on campus make fun of Clinton before. 
The second laugh, though, is at Trump’s expense (“wrong!”). So is the third (“bad hombres”). So is the fourth (after Trump refuses to accept the results of the election if he loses)—although it’s more of a mass gasp than a laugh.
The rest of the time, the FDR room is silent. It’s not the attentive silence of the first debate at the Science Center, nor is it the disinterested silence of the second debate. Every Republican here—and there are more than a dozen—just looks… discouraged.
Every so often, cheering swells in the Forum.

Declan Garvey ’17 is a History concentrator in Mather House, and the current president of the Harvard Republican Club.
LH: The Harvard Republican Club refused to endorse Trump in August. How did that affect the club?
DG: Last year we started with 40 members, and by our fourth meeting we probably had 15 to 20. This time we started with 150 and by our fourth meeting we had 50 to 60 people. 
LH: Did the decision make it more acceptable to be Republican on campus?
DG: Yes. I think it gave us a degree of goodwill. It gave us the ability to speak to parts of the school that wouldn’t have listened before, to put it bluntly. Democrats have come up to members of the club and said, “We really respect what you guys did.”
There’s this meme on #NeverTrump Twitter, “Strange New Respect.” Democrats will tweet at #NeverTrump people, “I have strange new respect for you and your positions.” Of course, as soon as the election’s over they’ll go back to “You’re a crazy right-wing nutjob.”
LH: Are you going to vote for Trump?
DG: I’m going to vote third-party because I’m in Illinois. If I was in a swing state I would be voting for Hillary, because Trump is dangerous. I could never see myself supporting him.
LH: Do you understand why people vote for Trump?
DG: I’m from Illinois. I come from a family that is Republican. I have family members that are voting for Trump. I am one of the more conservative people on campus, probably, and I don’t fully understand it. I still can’t fully grasp how you’re able to overlook him and all these hypocrisies and double standards in his candidacy.
LH: Does the average Harvard student understand why people vote for Trump?
DG: No. If I can’t understand it then I don’t see how more liberal people, from the East Coast, from areas that are less inclined to support Trump, would start to grasp it. A lot of people on this campus probably haven’t met a Trump voter in their life. I think people are genuinely trying to understand. But it’s hard, if you haven’t lived those experiences. I haven’t either.
The country is two completely different worlds. That’s what we’re realizing in this election. There’s the urban population and the rural population. Different set of facts, different worldviews, different beliefs, different everything.

Sunday, Oct. 23:
It’s Sunday evening, and I’m on Facebook.
A guy I met freshman year has shared a photo by Humans of New York about a little boy who wants to be president of Venezuela. I like it.
My standing Thursday dinner date has posted a photo with a caption about Beyoncé. I like that too. 
Someone I knew in high school has liked an article by the New York Post, accidentally dredging its other content up into my dash. “Eleanor Roosevelt’s ‘mistress’ died heartbroken and alone,” the New York Post informs me. “Celebs celebrate Chicago Cubs win in style,” it says. “Trump leading in poll that has best record over last three elections.” A tiny image of the orange man smiles out at me.
What? That must be wrong. Everyone’s been saying that Clinton’s going to win.
I scroll down my newsfeed. Someone in the Dems has shared the New York Times again. “Victory in Sight, Clinton Seeks to Leverage Lead Down the Ballot,” the front page states with assurance.
“Clinton Leads Trump By Double Digits,” promises a girl from my freshman dorm, via MSNBC.
“16 DAYS LEFT: HILLARY ON FIRE!” screams a guy in my section, via the Huffington Post.
Whew!
I am relieved. I am so relieved. Post-debates, post-sexist tape, the presidential race feels like it’s passed some kind of turning point. I truly think Clinton is going to win. My friends think Clinton is going to win. The New York Times thinks Clinton is going to win.
But—I never really believed she could lose. I don’t mean I haven’t aware of the possibility. I was. I am. I know that some people are repelled by Clinton’s cool professionalism (and/or her gender.) I understand that America has a vast, angry, usually politically apathetic electorate that’s been roused by Trump’s rhetoric of nationalism and change. I’ve seen their Facebook posts, their lawn signs, their hats.
I’ve just never met them.
