After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there was ever a good time for President Obama to make one of his lauded grand-slam speeches, it was last week. Obama’s hallmark health-care reform suffered a disheartening blow with the January 19th election of Republican Scott Brown to the Senate, thereby ruining the Democrats’ filibuster-proof majority. Coupling the election with a lack of progress on many of the other issues that comprised a major part of Obama’s campaign, a chorus of pundits, politicians, and voters immediately declared Obama’s agenda dead or, at least, majorly stunted. When he had the nation’s attention during the annual State of the Union, Obama had one goal to fulfill: convincing America that the remainder of his term holds a possibility for the actualization of health-care reform and other initiatives. And, as a rebuttal of Republicans’ and pundits’ claims, Obama’s State of the Union address was indeed effective.
There is no question that, since the 2008 elections, Democrats have suffered many setbacks. In particular, anger at the continually increasing rate of unemployment, now at 9.7 percent, in addition to the size of the deficit and the level of government spending, has led the national discourse to adopt a more populist, anti-government tone. Republicans have been quick to point fingers at the Democrats as the cause of these problems and the source of the nation’s anger. Obama responded to their claims with an appropriately combative tone in order to show that he is listening closely to the Americans’ concerns and will not ignore public sentiment, but also to insist that the Democrats do not deserve all of the blame for the current problems afflicting Americans.
In addition to his tenor and language, the substantive components of Obama’s speech merit praise. Many voters believe that Obama’s administration has been devoting too much attention to health-care reform at the expense of the economy. To address this concern, he wisely spent a significant amount of time focusing on the economy, the middle class, and the middle of the country. By doing so, Obama indicated that his priorities undoubtedly include job creation, education, and a more open government.
In addition, Obama followed through on a campaign promise by making a clear commitment to seek the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” the law banning open homosexuality in the military. While in the past Obama hedged his bets on this divisive issue by using unclear language and varying his opinion based on his audience, such a public announcement indicates his seriousness about tackling the issue openly. Presenting a plan when he had the full attention of the media and the country as a whole was a transparent and direct way for Obama to debut his renewed commitment to equality for homosexuals in the military. Although Obama could have used the State of the Union to speak abstractly, he chose to announce specific policy initiatives—a very wise decision for a president trying to convince people that he is still capable of inspiring reform.
Obama’s astute speech proved that, even given the failures of the past weeks, the Democrats have no reason to run for the hills—contrarily, they must work harder than ever to accomplish significant reform. After all, the Democrats still have a 59-seat majority in the Senate, a majority in the House, and control of the White House. As Obama’s first State of the Union address indicated, he is an able politician, and his party has no reason to abandon its entire agenda at this point in time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Oh my God. 45 emails in my inbox? I just checked it three hours ago.” Such cries ring throughout Harvard. Every Harvard student knows the feeling of opening their email in hopes of finding new Facebook updates or news from friends, only to find 30 emails inviting them to attend different student group events.
The current event-publicizing model in which student groups spam as many list-serves as possible with event blurbs isn’t working. It’s annoying, ineffective, and limited in potential impact. Instead, in order to streamline event-publicizing on campus, University administrators should commit more resources to this problem and work with the Undergraduate Council to offer a new, more user-friendly online events calendar.
Every group sending out so many emails lowers the probability that each email will be read and runs the risk of alienating potential event attendees. Additionally, this type of publicizing often depends on students planning their schedules weeks or days in advance. Many students take things day-by-day and will go to events whenever they have time; because list-serves aren’t personalized to ad hoc schedules, emails can be completely ineffective when students delete them days before the event happens. Often, students only find out about interesting events the morning after they happen.
Students do share some blame for the inundation of emails. From the start of freshman year, whether because of our broad curiosity or plain indecisiveness, many of us have signed up on every group and event list that could ever even remotely interest us. But we wouldn’t have to do this if we had a more intelligent, refined online events calendar. Right now, students don’t use the current online events calendar, HarvardEvents, because it’s just too overwhelming—it’s one big mass of uncategorized daily events.
I’m not alone in this view—an improved events calendar was a central plank of the Bowman-Hysen campaign. This semester the UC is working with HarvardEvents creator, CS 50 Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, to categorize all the events. They are also considering requiring every group that gets UC funding to put their events on the calendar.
These changes are laudable. If they go through, students would have the ability to selectively search for whatever events—from “Celebrity Speaker” to “Cultural Dance Party”—they want to attend whenever their individual schedules will permit. However, they are not enough. The University should actively work with the UC—which has already taken some initiative—to take additional steps to make the improved events calendar more interactive and personalized.
Similar to Facebook events, students should have the ability to explicitly indicate whether they will be attending events. This will help event planners prepare for how many people will be coming and in addition, allow students to see which of their friends are coming. Each student’s interface should also be specialized, so students are able to choose their preferences—what topics they like and when they are generally available. Similar to Google News, the system should offer students event suggestions based on these preferences. If the University and UC are in need of inspiration, Stanford’s online events calendar has a very intuitive interface and would be a great model for Harvard to follow.
This new calendar should become the default publicizing medium on campus. While the UC’s idea to make funding contingent on using the events calendar is a good one, they should also actively discourage email spamming.
The goal of this initiative is clear. Students will have cleaner inboxes, greater access to information, and the freedom to selectively plug in and digest all this information. Club groups will also benefit because instead of just targeting their list-serve members, they will be able to present detailed information to the entire Harvard community. With the ability to plan and update their events-calendar section for the full year, they won’t be hassled with continuously sending multiple reminders for each event throughout the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pundits have been studying the wrong Roosevelt. President Obama shouldn’t look to Franklin, class of 1904—at least not this year, when anything like FDR’s serenity and gentility comes across as aloofness. Obama will have to adopt a different model for his sophomore effort. If the president is to eliminate what he referred to in his State of the Union address as the national “deficit of trust,” he needs to engage the average American’s concerns of economic foul play more directly and more vividly. As Obama negotiates with Congress on a jobs bill and other long-term recovery efforts behind the scenes, he should use the bully pulpit to fight the forces that impede his agenda in the open. This year, Obama should fully embrace the role of the self-sacrificial, morally-driven protagonist of the political theater.
In short, in 2010 Obama must be more like Theodore, class of 1880.
TR’s progressivism was nothing like the technocratic, scholarly progressivism of the present age. He was an active, animated federal regulator concerned with protecting the social fabric and the welfare of the ordinary American. He demanded sacrifice and hard work from his supporters and fair play from his opponents. Like Obama, Roosevelt was confronted with the task of actively restoring government’s credibility in an age of dramatic economic inequality and misconduct. Although Teddy didn’t face massive unemployment as Obama faces today, he did have to confront an economic elite disconnected from the public interest. To counter these foes, TR had to harness the power of populist anger without letting it define him. Obama must now do the same.
Such a transformation seems, on the surface, improbable. The dispositions of these two executives could not be more dissimilar. Whereas TR was known for his vigor and zeal, Obama’s presidency is remarkable for its cool. But perhaps this is changing. In his recent meeting with House Republicans, Obama took fire from the opposition on a national broadcast and appeared, for the first time in a long time, to be the proverbial man in the arena, brow marred with sweat. The president systematically dismissed many Republican counterarguments as mere political posturing—something fresh, something promising.
In TR’s day, promoting the common good and improving the quality of American life meant busting up monopolies and creating hard and fast rules for corporate responsibility. In Obama’s administration, it means advocating substantial financial reform without apology, illuminating the ills of the lobbying culture, and taking quick action against the Supreme Court’s recent, undemocratic ruling granting corporations the right to invest unlimited sums in political campaigns. Roosevelt attacked bankers and the titans of socially-detrimental enterprises from the right, standing up for individual entrepreneurial opportunity and a level economic playing field. Obama must attack from the left and stand up for the financial futures of America’s families and communities.
This is the best pathway toward reviving trust in Washington while the long, slow process of job recovery sets in. Like TR, Obama need not condemn the self-interested and entrepreneurial spirit of Wall Street. He need only argue the truth: Business is underpinned by certain social norms, which are being undermined. Like TR, Obama should condemn misconduct and not condemn wealth. TR’s theme was that prosperity demands a certain level of trust between Wall Street and Main Street. When the economic elite forget that they are also citizens, the trust between the privately powerful and the rest of the public is breached. When houses are foreclosed after irresponsible decisions, when community banks collapse, when hedge funds don’t recognize what they’ve bought and sold, and when credit freezes, the social structure upon which American capitalism relies begins to fail.
There is no doubt that the chief priority of Washington must be vigorously tackling unemployment. Arguably, this should have been done a year ago. Unfortunately, even if the Senate passes a comprehensive job bill this week, as Obama asked it to, we won’t see many of its effects for some time. The bill is likely to be passed piecemeal, and Obama will have to fight with moderate Democrats every step of the way. In the meantime, the president must do a better job of showing average Americans that he’s fighting for them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Either they don’t know, don’t show, or don’t care about what’s going on in the hood.” One of my favorite lines from Doughboy in the 1991 blockbuster movie, “Boyz n the Hood.” For everyone reading this who “don’t know” what’s going on in the inner city school system, what follows is a brief glimpse of the situation based on visits to 8,500 middle school children in five major American cities. The experiences related here demonstrate that no matter how bad you believe the conditions are in inner-city schools…they are far worse.
Although anecdotal, the conditions described here are representative of all the schools we visited as our organization, City ACES (Athletes Changing Expectations), progressed on its nationwide tour of America’s inner-city schools.
These are my reflections, generated through individual observation and prolonged discussions with school administration officials both on and off the record. Principals and teachers expressed their desperation, and implored me to tell the world what was going on in the inner-city school system. This is my attempt to do so.
At many of the schools, the first thing we noticed was the constant din of children yelling, screaming, and generally being unruly. Adult supervision was scarce, and where there was an adult present, the adult was scurrying from one end of the classroom to the other, quieting the children here and breaking up fights there.
The hectic environment immediately led one to wonder: How can anybody possibly learn under these conditions? The answer, of course, is that they cannot. Students’ mental aptitude and willingness to learn becomes irrelevant. The level of activity and disorder fosters an atmosphere where you literally cannot hear yourself think, let alone comprehend new ideas and concepts.
The most heartbreaking element of this situation is that many of the kids who attend these schools are fiercely intelligent, but the school system is slowly eating them alive, and every adult at the schools we visited, including myself, knew it. I use the expression “eating them alive” because that is the best way I know how to describe the situation. The crushing feeling is analogous to how it must feel for a creature to be eaten alive by a python. What makes the prospect so sickening is that the prey is still alive and conscious as the snake is swallowing them whole, caught between life and death, painfully aware that they are being eaten, but powerless to do anything about it.
This is comparable to what is happening in America’s inner-city school system, and is a reality for many of the children who attend such schools. The teachers, and many students, realize that the educational system is failing them, and that they are ill prepared to face the real world beyond graduation. As one principal remarked, “Where the schools fail, the streets will take over,” and all involved parties can only look on with a sense of helplessness, caught in a diabolical waiting game as the schools and the streets vie for the hearts and mind of the children.
Conversations with some of the children revealed a pervasive nihilism and a feeling that forebode an inevitable early death, whether it be in the form of a physical death on the streets, or a death of identity that occurs when one enters the justice system and effectively becomes dead to society.
As if to underscore this point, and perhaps to act as a precursor for entrance into the justice system, many of the schools remind one of a prison, both in their physical layout and the very visible presence of uniformed police officers all around the building. It is no secret that if you devalue human beings and begin treating them as animals, or future inmates, they will eventually begin to act as such. It is no different in the American inner city school system.
However, despite apparent acts of deviance, teachers who talked to me off the record stated that the student’s behaviors were symptomatic of a more psychological problem, as many of the children were effectively suffering from “post-traumatic stress disorder.” In hushed tones, these teachers described issues that students were forced to deal with at home, and how the students deal with an ever-present understanding that many in the school’s leadership have no sincere or abiding interest in their future welfare. Rather, these “leaders” are interested in housing them for eight hours, without truly teaching or imparting knowledge, and then releasing them back into the custody of their parents or guardians. They were more interested in maintaining eight-hour babysitting facilities than running schools. Rather than confronting and truly aiding these children in discovering the bigger motivational, psychological, and emotional factors that were causing them to act out academically or otherwise, these administrators were quick to scream, intimidate, and channel the children to uniformed officers for reprimand. This treatment served to desensitize them to the fear of authority or detention, and began preparing them for a life within the justice system at an early age.
As it stands, the inner-city educational system must be fundamentally restructured, from the way the schools are financed, to faculty recruitment and expulsion. As we move forward, the urgency of the situation comes into sharper focus. If our children cannot run to us to fix the situation, then to whom can they run? If we do not take action now, then when?

“If anyone really wanted to change the world, they’d bring in the fashion bitches,” writes Kelly Cutrone in her new book “If You Have to Cry, Go Outside,” to be released on Feb. 2.
This piece of information might startle the Harvard crowd, who isn’t known for sartorial savvy. The book outlines her tumultuous rise from homelessness to the fashion elite and serves as a guide for navigating an alternative career path. Famous for being the boss from hell of Lauren Conrad on “The Hills” and Whitney Port and her cohorts on “The City,” Cutrone’s own show on Bravo premiered this Monday.
I spent an afternoon with Kelly in the New York City office of People’s Revolution, the public relations firm that she founded. When I first met Kelly, I was carrying a cupcake. Her first words to me were “No one eats solid food anymore. That’s so 90s.” I immediately thought back to the episode of “The City” in which Kelly descends upon a young girl for being too skinny, and I realized that she was just being friendly.
Before the interview begins, I watched her put Donald Trump in his place. The Donald was angry that Kelly dissed him in her new book about his support for Mike Tyson after Tyson was accused of rape. As Trump tried to deny her accusation, she first screamed “motherfucker” and then made one phone call to a very high profile former business partner to corroborate her claim. Upon confirmation, her interns cheered, and Kelly turned to me and said, “Let’s do this.”
1. Fifteen Minutes: Your new book is titled “If You Have to Cry, Go Outside.” Have you ever shed a tear on the job?
Kelly Cutrone: I usually cry at least twice a year. Usually at some point during fashion week. Sometimes it’s out of joy or sheer frustration, but sometimes its because of being ruthlessly and needlessly attacked. I cried out of gratitude once.
2. FM: Who is the target audience for your book?
KC: Village girls and gay boys.
3. FM: The book is supposed to be a guide for girls to make it in the real world. Does it mostly speak to the PR industry, or did you try to include advice for any career?
KC: It’s not really about PR. There are a lot of fashion stories about the fashion industry. But it’s mainly a book to make people realize they’ve been programmed. I talk a lot in the book about how mothers, the life-bringers themselves, sing songs to their daughters like, “First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby in a baby carriage.” It’s excessive.
You have to be skinny, pretty, make good grades. Says who?
4. FM: How does this apply to kids at Harvard?
KC: Kids at Harvard, I’m sure there are some that are living their dream, but there are people there experiencing someone else’s dream. And if there are people around you who aren’t listening to you, who don’t believe that you can manifest what it is you are dreaming, or don’t want you to, then you should get the fuck away from them.
It’s a book about deprogramming, about intuition, about taking risks—especially when you are young.
5. FM: You also have a new show on Bravo, “Kell on Earth,” that features your role as a mother. Has your daughter become a celebrity at school since filming began?
KC: The LA Times has said that she had the best line in the first episode when she says, “Why should I bother getting dressed up if you are going to put me in the third row? Everyone knows that no one can see you from the third row.” Her friends know she is on TV, but she’s a NY private school kid. Her friends are on Broadway.
6. FM: And is it really hell to work for you?
KC: I’m sure on some days it is, but I’m sure on some days it’s absolutely divine. We usually start with about twenty interns and end up with about five or six. These are the ones really serious about what they are going to do. They go through this growth process. They trust me. They know I actually care about them and I’m here to teach them something. They are like soldiers. I’m not going to sit there and cuddle them. I’m not going to make them think that the fashion world is something different from the brutal, fast-paced, hard-working world that it is.
7. FM: Why do you insist that your employees wear all black?
KC: I have a rule list of things you can and can’t do. The all-black rule is for fashion shows and events. It’s like a private school. We don’t want self-expression at our shows. Do you think Martin Margiela wants his PR team to wear Cavalli? I don’t think so. Black is non-descript. You don’t know if it’s GAP or Yohji.
8. FM: Few students from Harvard seem to get into the fashion and entertainment world. What’s the best way to break into it from college?
KC: It’s to not apply in May. Fashion has its own calendar. Plan on interning between May and August 15. It’s competitive. It’s like the entertainment industry.
9. FM: It’s also internship search season for us. You’ve mentored interns for years. What should we be wearing to interviews?
KC: Depends on where you are interviewing. Of course you can never go wrong with all black! Didn’t you guys learn that when you were born? Weren’t your moms whispering in your ear, “You will go to Harvard. You will go to Harvard.”
10. FM: What do you think about Harvard?
KC: It’s the ultimate brand. The joke is that it’s hard to get in, but once you get in it’s a piece of cake. Harvard is a branded education. It’s like wearing Cartier. Harvard kids go to the Harvard Club, then they’re part of the alumni fund, and they love seeing other Harvard people. It’s like having twelve Louis Vuitton steamer trunks and seeing someone else with the same thing. It’s the brand-brand-diggity brand.
And people who go to Harvard can’t wait to say where they went to college. And regardless of your religion or ethnicity, you have to do it with a slightly waspy undertone and lean back. Interns! Interns. (Turns to interns) Do you agree that people who went to Harvard love saying they went to Harvard?
Interns in unison: Yes.
FM: Would that prevent you from hiring from Harvard?
KC: No. Harvard gives you confidence. It’s like being in a Range Rover versus a Hyundai. Is it going to get you there faster? No. Does it feel better along the way? Hell yeah.
FM: What do you think about the idea of a Harvard-inspired fashion line?
KC: Shut up. They are shameless branders. I like it.
FM: Even though it’s preppy?
KC: Definitely. I represent things that I wouldn’t wear. I wear black.
12. FM: You’ve recently said in an interview that the one thing you’ve learned from your interns is that you don’t want to send your daughter to college. Even to Harvard?
KC: The funny thing is, she told me she wanted to go to Harvard once. I asked her why, and she said, “Because all my friends do.” She also asked me, “Why don’t we have a mezuzah?” These are the questions that six-year-olds in New York ask.
13. FM: What do you think of the trend of celebrities who are taking the helm as creative directors at fashion houses, such as Lindsay Lohan at Ungaro and SJP at Halston Heritage?
KC: Big mistake. Well, I don’t know about Sarah Jessica Parker, but Carrie Bradshaw and Sarah Jessica are not the same person. Patricia Fields was putting together the clothes for Carrie.  With Lindsay, we were all shocked. And the collection was such a failure that we could not believe they kept her on.
The old school tactics of exclusivity, of not letting anyone in, of this great Wizard of Oz behind the curtain. It’s all overkill for fashion houses.
14. FM: Has your PR firm People’s Revolution had to change its strategies at all with the recession?
KC: We’ve done brand strategy forever. Back in the day, a publicist’s job was to say, “You give me a product and I’ll get it attention.” But you can’t get a shitty t-shirt in vogue. We’re like the anti-PR PR company. Companies come to us for new brand strategy and reinvigoration or restarting. To call ourselves only PR is limiting.
15. FM: With all of your recent ventures, do your clients ever get jealous that you’re getting more press than they are?
KC: Yes, but you don’t see people yelling at Obama saying he’s on the news too much. The more power you have, the more effective you are. It’s like Angelina. Look what she’s done for Cambodia. Or Oprah. You get more done.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Incidence of homicide, larceny and aggravated assault on Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority property dropped 21 percent in 2009, the MBTA Transit Police reported in a press release last week. This represents the MBTA’s lowest level of serious crime since 1980.
“When you consider we transport 1.2 million people a day on our system, the number of crimes that occur on our system is incredibly low,” said Joseph O’Connor, deputy chief of the MBTA Transit Police.
In 2009 there were 827 recorded serious crimes, also classified as Part I crimes, compared to 1052 reported in 2008.
Aggravated assaults fell from 103 to 88 in the last year, and there were no homicides in 2009.
He attributed this to more effective policing as well as other initiatives the MBTA has introduced.
To address recurrent problems such as parking lot thefts, the MBTA police  launched public awareness campaigns.
Police officers handed out literature at MBTA stations reminding people to put away valuables such as GPS navigation devices and to wipe the mounting marks left by these devices off their windshields after use.
Theft from motor vehicles is classified as larceny, which O’Connor said is the most common type of crime committed in the MBTA system.
Incidence of larceny dropped 26 percent from 701 to 522 last year. Despite this drop, preventing larceny remains a priority for MBTA officials.
Beyond MBTA campaigns and strategies, O’Connor said passengers still need to make an effort to be more careful with their belongings, such as bicycles and electronic items.
The MBTA has also introduced initiatives to combat Part II crimes, which include fare evasion, simple assault and loitering. While Part I crimes have decreased in the past year, Part II crimes have increased by 32 percent.
The MBTA targets fare evasion with a strategy called “point-of-entry policing,” in which police officers in uniform and plainclothes are assigned to MBTA entry points to issue citations to fare jumpers.
If the violator has an outstanding warrant, he or she will be arrested. There were 2,864 fare evasion citations issued in 2009, up from 1,267 in 2008.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the limited number of programming options offered during the College’s inaugural January Term, the Undergraduate Council will collaborate with over a dozen student groups to create new on-and off-campus opportunities for next year.
In the coming month, the UC leadership will submit to the College administration a comprehensive proposal detailing each student organization’s ideas for J-term programming, according to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11.
“It will be a working process and dialogue [with the administration],” Hysen said, noting that the UC hopes to encourage the College to increase the number of students granted housing during J-term so that they can take advantage of potential opportunities on campus next year.
Hysen said that the administration’s main concern regarding J-term housing is the assurance that students on campus are involved in legitimate and productive activities—as opposed to “just letting anyone who wants to go to one meeting a week” stick around.
UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 noted the additional financial considerations of opening up more dining halls besides Annenberg—a move that would require extra funding for food and staffing.
Hysen said that the UC has contacted about 30 groups—including the Institute of Politics, Harvard Undergraduate Television, the Voice, and Phillips Brooks House Association—to ask for potential programming ideas, associated costs, the number of students a program would involve, a sample daily schedule, and whether a program would be open to the entire student body or only to organization members. About 15 groups have responded with fairly concrete answers, according to Hysen.
For example, HUTV hopes to use J-term next year to produce and shoot a short film on campus—an opportunity for which all students can apply through a process that will ultimately select a 30-student team of producers, actors, and crew members, according to HUTV President Tiffany N. Fereydouni ’11.
PBHA Vice President Christopher J. Loney ’11 said the organization was looking to expand upon this year’s initiatives, which included Habitat for Humanity trips to Guatemala and New Orleans, after school programs, and work with the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
According to FAS Spokesman Jeff A. Neal, the administration is waiting on the completion of the winter break survey e-mailed to undergraduates by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds in January before weighing in on any decisions regarding next year’s J-term.
“Because the survey isn’t complete, we do not have information we can share at this time,” Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unconscious man was found on a walkway in front of Peabody Terrace at 1:15 a.m. on Friday, according Harvard shuttle operator Melvin Washington, Jr. The person’s identity and current medical condition remain unknown at this point.
Washington said he picked up a regular passenger from Memorial Hall at 1 a.m. as he usually does about three nights a week. Within 15 minutes, he pulled up in front of Peabody Terrace where the passenger lives, he said.
But as the shuttle came to a stop beside the Peabody Terrace building sign, Washington said he and the passenger noticed a man lying by a trash can on the walkway. Washington and the passenger left the shuttle and approached the body, asking the man, who was curled up on his right side in a fetal position, if he was okay.
After seeing only a slight hand movement and feeling no pulse, they called 911.
The two carried the 5-foot-6 body several yards across the sidewalk and laid him on the floor of the shuttle, placing newspapers underneath his head, Washington said. Within minutes, the Harvard University Police arrived. They were quickly joined by the Cambridge Fire Department and paramedics.
Washington said they did not find any form of identification on the person, though he said paramedics estimated the man was 25 years of age.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined requests for information about the incident. Neither the passenger nor the Cambridge Fire Department could be reached for comment.
“Whether he was a Harvard student or not, he was too young,” Washington said. “I couldn’t leave him like that.”
Washington called for another driver to cover his route for the time that he and the passenger stayed with the body.
Washington recalls seeing vomit still trickling down the side of the man’s mouth into a pile by his face. His knuckles, Washington said, were “red like a lobster,” and he was wearing only a dark thin jacket with jeans and sneakers. The man’s eyes were still open, Washington added.
“My boss said we did the right thing,” Washington said Friday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert D. Joffe ’64, a prominent attorney and former head of Cravath, Swaine & Moore law firm, died Thursday from pancreatic cancer. He was 66 years old.
A 1967 Harvard Law School graduate, Joffe’s career was defined by his high profile work in antitrust and corporate governance law, as well as his commitment to civil rights.
“[He] was a superb lawyer and a true leader in the legal community,” HLS Dean Martha L. Minow said in a press release. “His wisdom, judgment, and intellect infused his deep commitments to enhancing justice and the rule of law around the world and his outstanding service to this law school.”
Joffe joined Cravath in 1967, but a few months into his time as an associate, he went to work in Malawi’s Ministry of Justice. There he spent two years helping rewrite the country’s laws and procedures for local courts.
He returned to Cravath in 1969, became a partner in 1975, and was elected deputy presiding partner in November 1997. He was elected presiding partner in 1999, a position he held until 2006.
Joffe was best known for his work with Time Inc. Joining in 1978, he served as the head outside litigator for Time and guided the company as it merged with Warner Communications in 1990, according to his obituary in the New York Times.
Later in his career, Joffe advised directors of Fannie Mae and represented independent directors of Merrill Lynch before the financial firm was acquired by Bank of America in January 2009. Joffe also advised the board of General Motors amidst talks of bankruptcy, according to Bloomberg News.
Throughout his career, Joffe, who was raised in New Jersey, also had an interest in civil rights law.
Joffe, known as “Joff” in college, graduated from Harvard in three years. He was “very considerate,” and liked by everyone, wrote his freshman year roommate Peter A. Mansbach ’65 in an e-mailed statement. It was during his college years that Joffe’s concern for civil rights emerged, said his younger brother Paul L. Joffe ’69.
Paul said he recalls his brother Robert sitting  with friends by the Charles, discussing the world’s most significant challenges.
“They decided that the two biggest problems were the nuclear threat, and civil rights,” Paul said. “And they decided that they should dedicate themselves to solving those problems.”
In 1962, Joffe wrote a letter to civil rights activist James Farmer, according to his son David V. Joffe ’00. The letter advocated a mass student march to Washington D.C. in support of civil rights.
David said his father saved Farmer’s reply that said the march was a good idea, but too difficult to organize.
“Nine months later, the march happened. My father clearly cared about civil rights issues even as an undergraduate,” David said.
In law school, Joffe was the case-note editor for The Harvard Civil Rights/Civil Liberties Law Review.
Joffe worked on the first issues of the review, which was founded in 1966 following the passage of the Voting Rights Bill in 1965, said Gordon J. Davis, a fellow editor.
“[Robert] was a very diligent, thorough person. I saw many of the qualities that distinguished him later in his career,” Davis said.
Joffe’s commitment to civil rights was just “part of who he was,” Davis added.
In 1989 Joffe argued Martin v. Wilks before the Supreme Court. Robert K. Wilks and other white firefighters had filed an anti-discrimination suit after a consent decree required that black firefighters be promoted. In this pro bono case Joffe represented the black firefighters in Birmingham, Ala.
Joffe is survived by his wife Virginia,  two children, two step-children, and two grandchildren.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Apocalyptic”—that was the word used by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Diaz to describe the massive earthquake that rocked Port-au-Prince, Haiti on Jan. 12.
At Friday’s interdisciplinary panel exploring the historical and political consequences of the disaster, Diaz described the Haitian earthquake as an apocalyptic event—not only in terms of its destructive force, but its stark exposure of the developing nation’s place in an international power dynamic.
“The system in which we live—which we can call capitalism—this is a system in which the Haitian catastrophe is not just normal but inevitable, that in fact a large part of the world is immiserated and stripped of resources to sustain certain lives of privilege,” said Diaz, a Dominican writer catapulted to fame by his novel “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.”
Sponsored by the Department of African American Studies, the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute, and the Committee on African Studies, the panel assembled a variety of perspectives on the Haitian crisis from writers, including Haitian-born poet Patrick Sylvain, and doctors like Mary Louis Jean Baptiste, a Haitian-American mental health expert.
Estimates of the January earthquake’s death toll place the figure around 200,000, though the final number may be even higher. But Baptiste said Friday that the consequences of the earthquake reverberate beyond the bare statistics and the country’s borders.
In the aftermath of the earthquake, one of Baptiste’s Haitian-American patients has been unable to work, having fallen into depression as a result of the loss of her son in the devastation. Baptiste said the individual will now be unable to support her family in Haiti—a widespread phenomenon threatening the country’s economy, which is largely dependent on remittances from Haitians abroad.
But the panelists also took issue with the disaster’s media coverage, which they said has placed undue blame on Haitians for the magnitude of the tragedy.
Sylvain, who teaches Creole at Harvard, said a history of foreign intervention in Haiti and of pernicious economic policies has helped to undermine the Haitian economy, but he acknowledged that government corruption has also contributed to the nation’s impoverishment.
Calling Haiti “the founding nation of modernity that sought to create equality throughout the colonies,” Sylvain said that the media has long overlooked the rich history and culture of Haiti.
When Haiti becomes a byword for poverty, the country’s vibrant culture and history—encompassing rich literary and music traditions—become obscured in more negative coverage, according to David D. Hutchinson ’12, the president of the Harvard Haitian Alliance.
Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere and ranks towards the bottom of the United Nations’ human development indices.
Panelists, including Harvard Medical School epidemiologist P. Gregg Greenough, said that in the short-term, the international community needs to focus on humanitarian aid to feed and care for the Haitian people.
But in the long-term, the international community faces the challenge of changing what Diaz called “the narrative” concerning Haiti—a structural imbalance that has not only led to the neglect of a nation only a few hundred miles from Florida, but political indifference by the world’s powers until the earthquake struck the country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and professors said they favored President Barack Obama’s proposals to end government subsidies to banks that provide student loans and to aid students who choose careers in public service, although some questioned the likelihood that these plans will be enacted.
In his State of the Union address last Wednesday, Obama proposed a policy that would limit students’ debt payments to 10 percent of their discretionary income and forgive all student debt after 20 years—or 10 years for those who pursue a career in public service.
Anthony R. Britt ’10, who plans to work for Teach for America after graduation, said that such a policy might make the choice to work in public service easier for students.
“A Harvard graduate might have a choice between doing something in public service and investment banking on Wall Street... For people from a low income background, while public service might correlate better with their values, they might not be able to,” he said.
Sean M. Cuddihy ’11 said that he is currently confronting a similar choice as he seeks summer employment. “This summer I can apply for an IOP grant to work for a congressman and break even, or I can help my family stay afloat financially,” he said.
But some students expressed reservations about the efficacy of such a policy and the likelihood that it will become law.
“I don’t know that it’s enough to incentivize talented people who wouldn’t otherwise go into public service,” said John Chen ’12.
“I think it’s a good idea,” said Samantha R. Reiser ’11. “But we never come to any consensus on policy like that.”
The President also called for a bill that “will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans,” proposing instead a $10,000 tax credit for families paying for college and increased funding for Pell Grants to assist low-income students.
Government Professor Theda R. Skocpol called this idea “almost a textbook example of some of the things Obama is trying to do. It would reduce subsidies to the privileged, in this case banks, and...use the money to create broader benefits for the middle class and the poor.”
Under current federal law, the government subsidizes banks that give student loans and promises to repay them if families default, making student lending a lucrative industry, according to Suzanne Mettler, a government professor at Cornell University.
Harvard College Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue noted that the College does not participate in the Family Federal Education Loan program, the bank-subsidizing program Obama has proposed ending. She added that the College’s financial aid consists of grants rather than loans.  However, she said that many Harvard graduate students receive federal loans and stand to benefit from the new policies.
“[The proposed policy] “is going to be controversial just like healthcare reform,” Mettler said. “The battle lines are similar.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a condensed shopping period this semester, students lost what professors gained: time.
Students no longer had an extra weekend to meet with advisors, peruse the Q Guide, and order books on Amazon.com.
But the change also meant that faculty members were able to review enrollment lists, organize sections, and send out reading assignments over the weekend after Study Card Day.
Many freshmen dealing with courses with capped enrollment said they felt pressure to make decisions faster this semester.
“I thought it was much more stressful because every night I had to figure out what classes to go to the next day, and we didn’t have a weekend to think things over,” Lillian C. Alexander ’13 said. “I was organizing binders for classes I wasn’t even taking.”
Nicolas E. Jofre ’13 said he plans to treat next week as an extension of shopping week to finalize his courses.
But many upperclassmen—used to only a week-long break between semesters—were less concerned about the new shopping week format.
Brandon T. Perkovich ’11 mulled over the course catalog during January term to avoid the potential stress of a rushed shopping week.
Hannah S. Yohalem ’10 said she was more stressed about picking the perfect senior spring course load than the condensed schedule of shopping week itself.
Nadeem E. Abou-Arraj ’12, a Peer Advising Fellow, said that he did not notice a spike in anxiety levels of his advisees.
But for him personally, the new format presented an unexpected benefit: Abou-Arraj said that the schedule change forced him to be more on top of his work sooner.
“At least this way I feel like we won’t be as behind because we are forced to start earlier,” he said.
Classics professor Emma Dench wrote in an e-mail that some undergraduates told her they were waiting anxiously until 9 p.m. on Thursday night to hear whether they had gotten into a class.
Though several professors noticed that students were slightly more frenzied than usual, the new schedule provided more time to organize class sections.
According to history professor Daniel L. Smail, who said he appreciated receiving enrollment numbers before the weekend, students were seen “milling around” the history department on Friday, frantically trying to get study cards signed.
“There was some frustration on the part of the students because faculty members aren’t often around on Fridays,” he said.
Economics 1010b instructor Christopher L. Foote is looking forward to starting sections on a Monday—as opposed to a Wednesday, like last year— because it allows professors and section leaders “a little more time to get our act together.”
“I think if any student feels like they need a little bit of extra time, or if they change their mind, we try to be as flexible as possible,” he said.  “We’re not out to bust anybody’s chops.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stability at the goaltender position has long been a hallmark of Harvard women’s hockey, with stalwarts like Ali Boe ’06, Brittany Martin ’08, and senior Christina Kessler defending the net for the Crimson in recent years. But when Kessler’s college career came to a sudden end after she tore her ACL two weeks ago, Harvard was forced to thrust untested freshman Laura Bellamy into the starting role earlier than it ever planned to.
After mixed results in her first five appearances, Bellamy steadied herself just in time for a barrage of Dartmouth shots on Friday in Hanover, N.H., making 37 saves in a 4-1 Crimson win and marking the defining moment of her young career.
“She gives us confidence as defense,” Harvard co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “It’s like she knows exactly where to be. She’s natural in there.”
Junior forward Kate Buesser and the Crimson offense took care of the rest, displaying more efficiency than its counterpart. Despite being outshot 38-28, Harvard found the back of the net four times, with Buesser scoring twice.
“[The Big Green] is always a tough team to play against,” Farni said, “but I think we came out strong. We just kept plugging, and pucks started going in the net—that’s exactly what we need to be doing.”
The Crimson struggled to find its footing in the early stages of the contest, ceding the momentum to Dartmouth with a pair of first-period penalties. The Big Green rattled off 15 shots in the frame compared to Harvard’s 10.
But the Crimson penalty kill stood tall, and after earning a power play in the second period, Harvard struck.
Farni converted on an assist from junior and fellow defenseman Leanna Coskren to put the Crimson on the board 1:18 into the second. But Dartmouth wasn’t prepared to let the game slip away just yet, and the Big Green retaliated six minutes later with a score from Sally Komarek.
That would be Dartmouth’s last foray into the net, as Bellamy buckled down behind a defense that successfully fought off five Big Green power plays.
“It’s kind of an opportunity to prove myself right now,” Bellamy said. “I think the team has been playing great defense, and it’s made it an easy job for me. It’s been fun.”
With the Harvard blueliners resolute, the Crimson’s forwards got to the business of scoring.
Buesser initiated a flurry of goals, slipping the puck past Dartmouth goalie Mariel Lacina 16:32 into the second period. She then repeated the trick after intermission, notching another tally midway through the third frame to put Harvard up, 3-1.
Buesser has done her share to make up for the loss of the Crimson’s three leading scorers—Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Jenny Brine ’09, and Sarah Wilson ’09—to graduation last year, leading Harvard with 10 goals and 16 assists over 21 games.
“She’s doing a great job,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said of Buesser. “She plays tough, and she plays consistently tough, and that’s what makes a difference for us.”
Harvard added another insurance goal in the game’s closing minutes, when freshman Kaitlin Spurling scored off assists from Buesser and senior forward Randi Griffin.
“Regardless of what was going on in the game, we kept to our game plan and we didn’t deviate,” Stone said. “It was a tight game for a long time, and so I thought we stuck to our game plan and did a nice job and were patient. And once we got our opportunities, we took advantage of them.”
While Dartmouth is not the ECAC powerhouse it was in years past, it still represents a tough conference foe for the Crimson. Beating the Big Green was important for a Harvard team that is fighting a tough race to the top of the league standings.
With 27 points, Clarkson has a firm lead in the ECAC regular-season title hunt, but the Crimson is tied for third in the conference with Rensselaer and Princeton at 20 and is hot on the trail of second-place Cornell, which stands at 23.
Harvard’s place among its peers will have ECAC playoff implications in terms of seeding and home-ice advantage, and likely influence its chances of an NCAA Tournament bid as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard wrestling envisioned its home opener at the start of the year, it couldn’t have asked for more energy and enthusiasm from the crowd. Unfortunately for the Crimson (2-8-1), the lineup it pictured barely resembled the one on the mat during Saturday’s dual matches against Boston University (3-8-1) and Army (5-3) at the MAC.
With six starters sidelined due to injury or skin issues, Harvard once again struggled as a team despite a number of standout performances. Although three grapplers went undefeated on the weekend, the Crimson fell, 35-15, to the Terriers in the afternoon, before losing to Army, 35-11, in the nightcap.
“I couldn’t be more pleased with some guys,” co-captain Louis Caputo said. “But in other matches we need to be a little mentally tougher. These guys are our size, our age, and we shouldn’t be getting manhandled.”
ARMY 35, HARVARD 11
Although Caputo emphasized the similarity between the competitors, the reality for a depleted Crimson roster meant that a number of grapplers moved out of their weight class, leading to mismatches up and down the lineup. In addition to forfeiting the heavyweight match, Harvard trotted out rookies Chad Eason (125 lbs.) and Spencer Friedman (141) for the 133-lb. and 149-lb. bouts, as well as junior Fermin Mendez (133) for the 141. All three suffered falls in an 18-point swing that gave the Knights a commanding lead.
“[The size discrepancy] is huge,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “It makes a big difference.”
“[Our smaller wrestlers] are going out against guys that have another 10 pounds of muscle on them,” Caputo added. “It takes a lot to step on the mat against teams like Army, sending out tanks like that.”
But while the majority of the team struggled against a talented Knights squad, Caputo (184), co-captain J.P. O’Connor (157), and rookie Steven Keith (125) held their ground.
Keith (13-5) had perhaps the most impressive showing of the day, as he capped an undefeated weekend with a 12-2 major decision over Lance Penhale, a stalwart in the EIWA.
“[Penhale] is third or fourth in our conference, and [Keith] just majored him,” Weiss said. “He’s coming along and doing a nice job. We knew that was a big match for us.”
It looked as if Keith had a tough bout in store, as Penhale caught the young grappler’s leg and tripped him for an early takedown. But after a number of battles in which neither player could score, Keith blocked Penhale’s leg on a restart, giving the Crimson wrestler leverage for a reversal. Drawing on his momentum, Keith easily escaped again to start the second frame, en route to 11 unanswered points and a definitive win.
“I thought I wrestled pretty well,” Keith said. Obviously there’s always stuff you can do better, and I’ll look to work on that in the wrestling room, but overall, I was pretty happy with my performance.”
O’Connor and Caputo cruised to equally dominant victories. O’Connor (18-0) was never threatened, as he built a 6-0 lead with two takedowns and a reversal. Besides allowing an escape to attempt a final takedown, the Harvard captain enjoyed a mistake-free 8-1 major decision.
Caputo (11-2)—in his only competition of the day—simply overpowered Collin Whitmeyer. The 184-lb. grappler earned the last win of the evening for the Crimson, notching an 8-1 decision.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY 35, HARVARD 15
Roster shifts plagued the Crimson in its afternoon competition as well, as junior Jackson Salovaara (157) joined the list of grapplers competing above their weight class.
“Guys went out there and battled, and that’s all they could do,” O’Connor said.
Unfortunately for Harvard, Boston University was not interested in consolation points. The Terriers sealed the inaugural Charles Cup—a trophy dedicated this year to the rivalry between the only two Division I wrestling programs in Massachusetts—with the same three falls between 133 and 149 pounds.
Despite excellent showings from Keith and O’Connor, as well as a forfeit at 184 pounds, Harvard simply could not keep pace. Salovaara—competing in just his second bout of the season—also fell to his opponent in the 174-lb. class, but rather than show disappointment, Weiss noted the importance of giving inexperienced grapplers more time on the mat.
“We had guys wrestling that needed an opportunity to wrestle,” the coach said. “Are they ready? Maybe not, but I enjoy watching those guys, [who] put in the time every single day, go out and compete.”
Although the final result did not favor the Crimson, Keith once again stormed out of the gate to open the dual meet, taking down Ryan Dowd early and often. The rookie earned six points in the first frame without relinquishing his top position, demonstrating his ability to dominate riding time.
“That [skill] is what he came in with,” Weiss said. “[Keith] is real good on top, very hard to counter.”
After notching two more takedowns in the final frame, the young grappler solidified an 11-1 major decision to post another victory in a strong rookie campaign.
But O’Connor had the strongest bout of the afternoon, as the top-ranked grappler asserted himself with a technical fall. BU’s Andrew Swank scored his only two points when O’Connor consented to let him escape, only to take down the Terrier once more. The 18-2 win marked the biggest offensive output of the day for Harvard.
“Earlier in the season I was having a little problem scoring points, so it was nice to run the score up on somebody and get my offense going,” O’Connor said. “My confidence is high, but I’m [still] getting it to where it needs to be to make a push for a national title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to Waco, Texas this weekend to compete in the ITA Kickoff Tournament. Facing frigid temperatures and two non-conference opponents, the Crimson held its own, coming away with a 4-1 win over the Nevada Wolf Pack yesterday, but falling, 4-0, to the No. 5 Baylor Bears on Saturday.
In both matches, Harvard freshmen—who made up four of the six starting singles positions—paced the squad with high energy levels.
“[The freshmen] pretty much have been our on-court leaders,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “They’ve been a spark for the others.”
HARVARD 4, NEVADA 1
Weather was a major factor in yesterday’s match against the Wolf Pack.
“It was actually snowing this morning against Nevada,” junior captain Samantha Rosekrans said. “Not ideal tennis weather.”
Despite the cold and windy conditions, Harvard was able to capture four singles matches and secure a 4-1 victory.
But the Crimson opened the match by losing the doubles point. According to Green, Harvard’s lower level of play in doubles was due to inconsistency.
At No. 3, freshman Sophie Chang and sophomore Samantha Gridley gave the Crimson a boost with an 8-5 win. But Nevada stole the doubles point with wins at No. 1 and No. 2. The top Harvard pair of sophomore Holly Cao and Rosekrans fell, 8-6, and the tandem of freshmen Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton lost, 8-4.
“I thought our doubles started very flat today,” Green said.  “It wasn’t very good. The singles was much better, people were much more consistent.”
In singles, Tachibana took down Florence De Vrye, 6-2, 6-2, at No. 2. In the No. 3 slot, Norton won, 6-3, 6-4, and at No. 4, Rosekrans earned a 7-5, 6-1 victory. For the fourth singles win, Chang took down Sophie Stevens, 6-3, 6-4, in the No. 5 spot.
BAYLOR 4, HARVARD 0
The Crimson had its hands full with the Bears, one of the nation’s top teams. Baylor captured the doubles point and then won the first three singles matches to clinch the overall victory, 4-0.
“We obviously went in as the underdog,” Rosekrans said. “We knew we had no pressure, nothing to lose.”
Although the score would indicate otherwise, Harvard put forth a strong effort in the doubles portion of the match. Tachibana and Norton brought energy that allowed the pair to challenge its opponents, according to Green.
“We were trying to just have fun with it,” Rosekrans said. “In the doubles we were pretty evenly matched. In singles they overpowered us.”
In the No. 1 doubles position, Cao and Rosekrans managed to stay with No. 13 Lenka Broosova and Csilla Borsany but ultimately fell, 8-4. Gridley and Chang dropped their match by the same score.
At the No. 3 singles slot, Baylor’s Nina Secerbegovic, ranked No. 24 in the nation, defeated Norton, 6-0, 7-5.  In the No. 5 position, Rosekrans was similarly blanked in the first set, and ultimately fell 6-0, 6-2 to Taylor Ormond.
At No. 6 Carla Lundlar beat freshman Alexandra Lehman, 6-2, 6-3.
Because Baylor clinched the overall win with four match victories, Cao, Tachibana, and Chang did not finish their matches.
“Playing Baylor was a great experience, because they’re such a high level team with a bunch of accolades,” Green said. “I know it’s going to help us.”

It was a break from the grinding ECAC conference schedule, but for the Crimson women’s hockey team, Saturday’s contest was no vacation.
No. 7 Harvard welcomed No. 9 Providence (12-9-8, 8-4-4 Hockey East) to Bright Hockey Center in a matchup of two programs looking to make noise in the postseason. The Crimson (12-5-4, 8-5-2 ECAC) took control with an early goal and put the game away with a late one, earning a 2-1 victory.
“I liked how our team played tonight,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Providence didn’t go away, and we stayed on it. We managed the last minutes of the game pretty well. I’m very pleased with how it went.”
Though the Crimson outplayed the Friars for most of the game, Harvard found itself in a 1-1 deadlock in the waning minutes.
But when Providence winger Arianna Rigano was sent to the box for cross-checking with six minutes to play in the game, the Crimson made the most of the opportunity.
A series of quick cross-ice passes from junior Leanna Coskren and co-captain Kathryn Farni put the puck on senior Randi Griffin’s stick. From the right post, Griffin chipped the puck into the net for what would prove to be the game-winning goal.
“[Friar netminder Genevieve Lacasse] played great,” Stone said. “We had all kinds of chances, and we just couldn’t bury them, but we persevered. We had a great power-play goal at the end, that sort of vintage Harvard power play.”
The vintage power-play goal was followed up by some characteristically-stingy defense from the Crimson blueliners, as Harvard held Providence scoreless through a late-game power play and 92 seconds of 6-on-5 action.
Defense was the story throughout the afternoon, highlighted by the play of freshman goaltender Laura Bellamy. The rookie picked up 19 saves in her second-straight win—and first ever over a ranked opponent.
“She’s stepping up and she’s competing hard and that’s great to see, that’s what we’re asking,” Stone said. “Just keep us in the game, give us an opportunity to win. We’ll do our best in front of you.”
The Crimson started the game strong, opening the scoring just over five minutes in. Farni sent a pass to junior Katharine Chute, whose shot from the right circle bounced up into the top of the net for the 1-0 lead.
From there, Harvard cruised, outshooting the Friars, 27-11, through two periods of play.
“They have a strong goalie, but I think we kept getting some shots on net, which is something we wanted to do right from the start,” Farni said. “We wanted to come out hard and stay on them all three periods.”
All told, the Crimson launched 36 shots at Lacasse. But midway through the third, the home team faltered.
Providence earned a faceoff in its offensive zone, and sophomore center Kate Bacon won the draw and quickly passed the puck off to linemate Rigano. Rigano let a slow shot off, but Bellamy didn’t see it coming through a screen. The puck dribbled across the goal line, tying the score at one.
“We were dominating the game, and then to kind of let in a fluffy goal like that was tough,” Farni said. “But we bounced back. That’s what you’ve got to do, be resilient.”
Griffin’s goal came five minutes later, and gave Harvard its momentum back—and a lead that it would not relinquish.
“All weekend we’ve been talking about momentum changes in athletics, and how if you’re a basketball player, it happens to you all the time,” Stone said. “In hockey, it’s a little bit different...You just have to weather the storm and sort of respond and dictate what happens.”
All three of the Crimson’s offensive lines—two of which were shuffled heading into weekend play—saw significant ice time and were able to create chances in front of the goal.
“It’s been nice to see the chemistry develop between some of the new lines,” Farni said. “I think it’s been working out great, everyone seems to be getting along pretty well.”
Rookie center Jillian Dempsey, skating between Chute and senior Anna McDonald, put four shots on net, but more impressive was the freshman’s performance in the faceoff circle. Dempsey won 24 out of 27 draws on the afternoon.
“I think [the new lines] are pretty good—we’re generating some offense,” Stone said. “The kids are just playing better now. I think they’re getting going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rackets are heating up just in time for conference play.
The Harvard men’s tennis team built on the momentum it garnered last weekend to come up with its first win of the season this Saturday. The Crimson faced stiff opposition from programs that are at the same level as Harvard. The No. 61 Crimson invited No. 62 Brigham Young University, No. 67 Mississippi State University, and DePaul University to the Harvard Kick Off Tournament. This even competition allowed the Crimson to further assess its progress thus far and fine-tune its play before the team starts defending its ECAC crown.
“Mississippi State almost took out [top ten] Ole Miss, so it was pretty intimidating coming in,” junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans said. “Every match was an absolute war. Our doubles were looking great and we got the doubles point from every team. It’s good to see that everyone competed hard.”
Friday afternoon, the Crimson took on an in-form Brigham Young team. The Cougars won the match 4-3, taking the top four singles matches but not faring as well in doubles play. Chijoff-Evans played at the first spot and put up a battle in the first set against Thomas Shubert only to drop it, 6-7. Chijoff-Evans then took the next set, 6-3, but couldn’t come up strong in the final set, 2-6. Junior Aba Omodele-Lucien took his opening set, 6-3, but was unfortunate to also drop a frame by the closest margin, 6-7. Things didn’t pick up for the third-year starter as he also lost the decisive set, 6-4. Freshman Joshua Tchan, the top performer from last weekend’s competition, was swept in the third spot, 6-4, 6-2, along with fellow freshman Andy Nguyen, 6-4, 6-3.
Doubles play was by far Harvard’s greatest strength, as the squad took the top two games. Omodele-Lucien teamed up with freshman Christo Schultz for an 8-6 win. It was by the same score that ITA Regional Doubles champions Nguyen and sophomore Alistair Felton beat Brigham Young’s Evan Urbina and Spencer Smith. At the third spots, Chijoff-Evans and captain Michael Hayes couldn’t win against Daniel Hwang and Georgy Batrakov, falling to the Cougar duo, 8-2.
Saturday was a tiring day for the Crimson, facing a strong Mississippi State team in the afternoon while taking on DePaul at night. It was a similar story for Harvard in the first match of the day, once again dropping the top four of six singles matches but faring well in doubles play.
The Crimson showed off its doubles finesse to start the day when Chijoff-Evans and Tchan paired up to defeat the Bulldogs’ Louis Cant and Chris Doerr, 8-2. Harvard also took the other two doubles matches, with duos Felton and Nguyen and Omodele-Lucien and Schultz taking care of the sweep.
When it came to singles matches, the Crimson couldn’t come up with an answer. Chijoff-Evans lost at the number one spot to No. 42 George Coupland in three sets, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
“When I played BYU and Mississippi State, I felt I had a grip on the matches and that I was the better player,” Chijoff-Evans said. “It’s first time I’ve been first on the team and it puts a lot of pressure on me. At certain points, I was playing not to lose rather [than] to win. I was thinking too much.”
Omodele-Lucien also lost in a three set battle, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, while the freshman Tchan was swept in two sets by the same score, 6-3.
“I had some really tough matches and wasn’t able to pull out victories unfortunately,” Omodele-Lucien said. “I competed well and if I keep playing hard results will come. I will only take positives away from these losses.”
Harvard tennis showed its determination Saturday night against a then-undefeated DePaul squad. Chijoff-Evans shook off the two losses he suffered this weekend by beating Bartosz Jozwiak in the first game 6-2 and the last set was left unfinished, 3-3.
Omodele-Lucien—who dropped his third match—didn’t let his singles results translate over to his doubles play. He and Schultz won comfortably in the top spot, 8-5, with Harvard repeating the same score when Nguyen and Felton continued another successful weekend in the number two spot.
Felton and Nguyen also won their singles matches at the No.4 and No.5 spots respectively. It came down to the sixth spot between the Harvard captain Hayes and Mathias Hambach. Hayes did an excellent job edging his opponent in a close first game, 7-6, and had an easier time in the second, 6-3, to wrap up the tournament.
“We played a lot of great teams this semester and I feel like we’ve been put through the wringer,” Chijoff-Evans said. “We’ve seen what true college tennis is like and we’re going to be tough as nails going into ECAC play. Having a 1-2 record against better opposition is better than a 5-0 record against mediocre teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were moments during the Harvard men’s volleyball team’s 3-2 loss at Endicott (5-2) on Friday when the players seemed to have their first victory of the season at their fingertips. But instead, the Crimson again returned home empty-handed.
The loss sets Harvard, which was missing co-captain Gil Weintraub, back to 0-3.
“It was a unique, unique match,” co-captain Eric Kuld said. “We did a lot of things okay. We should be doing them a lot better.”
The match was close from the opening minutes, with the Crimson able to come away with a 47-45 victory in the first set, during which neither team was able to establish momentum. Each time one team had a kill or caught a lucky break from an attack or service error, the other would respond with the same on the next play. Kuld’s finishing abilities were constantly being called upon, as the senior finished the set with 10 kills.
The largest lead acquired by either team was a six-point Harvard advantage, 22-16, but the Gulls rallied back. It seemed that the set would never end, until finally Endicott committed back-to-back attack errors to give the Crimson the victory.
“The first game was cool just because it went so long,” sophomore Matt Jones said in a text message. “[It was] definitely the longest game I’ve ever played in.”
The attack errors were mistakes the Gulls quickly corrected in the second set, as they stormed to a 30-19 victory. Harvard kept it close for the first 20 points before Endicott went on a five-point run, taking advantage of a service error and two attack errors. Coach Brian Baise called a timeout, and play evened from that point, but the Crimson was never able to recover.
One more five-point run put Harvard at an insurmountable 10-point deficit. All it took was a few kills to even the match, 1-1.
And by that point, Harvard had the lost the momentum and couldn’t seem to stop the attacking abilities of A.J. Witkofsky and Zeke Kubisch in the third. The Crimson only won back-to-back points five times throughout the set, while the Gulls frequently had two- and three-point runs to win, 30-21.
“[Endicott] did not have a conventional playing style,” Kuld said. “They’re really good at chasing down balls on broken plays. They’re just really gritty as a team. It took us a while to figure that out.”
It looked like the close start might be a preamble to a blowout.
Instead, Harvard turned things around in the fourth set, controlling play as much as the Gulls had in the previous set. This time, it was the Crimson forcing errors and making kills, with Jones, sophomore Nicola Ivica, and freshman Derek Jansma finishing off point after point for Harvard.
Meanwhile, senior Soren Rosier and Jones were winning their serves, allowing Harvard to go on five- and four-point streaks late in the game.
“I think we started to find our rhythm,” Kuld said.
But unfortunately, the team couldn’t sustain that rhythm into the fifth set, when Endicott used a strong start to propel it to a quick victory.
“If we got off to a better start in the fifth set, I think we could have won,” Kuld said.
But the fifth set of volleyball games only goes to 15 points, leaving little room for error. When the Gulls charged to an 8-2 lead, the Crimson didn’t have much opportunity to rally.
While Harvard improved its play after a timeout, it couldn’t win consecutive points or steal back momentum. Finally, Witkofsky, who pestered the Crimson all night at the net, finished off the match with his 31st kill, sending the Crimson back to Cambridge on a disappointing note.
“Going five sets and losing is always a feeling you don’t forget,” Kuld said. “It’s a good opportunity for strengthening us...We’re glad we’re getting these learning experiences early in the season. Hopefully that is going to help us down the stretch in conference play when we need the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson escaped the pressure.
The pressure of four straight road games.
The pressure of seeking its first Ivy League win.
The pressure of Columbia’s full-court defense.
After playing four consecutive games away from Lavietes Pavilion—a stretch that included tough losses to Dartmouth and No. 13/14 Florida State—the Harvard women’s basketball team (10-6, 1-1 Ivy) returned to its familiar confines across the river last Friday night, notching its first conference victory of the season with a dominating 73-55 win over Columbia.
“We do love coming home to our gym, but we have to love all of the gyms we play in,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “Nevertheless, I was very pleased with how we played, and I thought that we came together as a team.”
Harvard and Columbia traded scoring runs in the opening minutes of the first half. Junior forward Emma Markley’s three point play extended the Crimson’s early lead to 15-5, but Lions guard Sara Yee’s back-to-back three pointers brought Columbia within two, at 15-13.
The Lions employed full court pressure the entire game, giving Harvard difficulty at first getting the ball past half court.
“Columbia is the best in the league at full court pressure,” Delaney-Smith said. “The key is to stay poised and find the open player, and not make the quick pass. We had a lot of turnovers early on because of that.”
The Crimson never looked back, though, as junior co-captain Christina Matera’s three pointer sparked an 18-7 run to close out the first half with a 33-20 lead. By halftime, seven players had already made their mark on the score sheet.
Despite committing 30 turnovers, Harvard appeared to have no problem establishing its offensive groove and maintaining it throughout the game.
“We turned the ball over stupidly, but that didn’t seem to bother us,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s why you can walk away with these type of games.”
The Crimson also managed to stay hot the entire game, shooting 65.9% from the field—including a season-high 70.8% in the second half. Leading the way for Harvard was Markley, who posted 19 points, eight rebounds, and a season-high seven blocks.
“Strong defense, rebounding, and a positive attitude made everything offensively click for us,” Markley said. “Everything follows through after that.”
Adding to the Lions’ woes was the Crimson’s precision from beyond the arc, as Harvard shot 7-of-9 from three point land. Matera—who scored 14 points in the game—was perfect from beyond the arc, converting all four of her three point attempts.
But what really allowed the Crimson to pull away was its stifling defense, a 2-3 zone that gave Columbia fits the entire game.
“[Columbia] didn’t like our zone, and we were anticipating their passes really well,” Delaney-Smith said. “They have some nice shooters but we were able to get out to them most of the time.”
“We run a make and miss offense,” added sophomore point guard Brogan Berry, who had seven assists and two steals in the game. “We were making our shots tonight, so we were able to focus on defense.”
With Columbia’s outside game stone cold—the Lions shot just 29.0% the entire game—it went inside to junior forward Judie Lomax looking for answers. Lomax, who led the NCAA in rebounding at 14.3 per game last year, scored a game-high 20 points, a concession that Delaney-Smith was willing to give considering that the star was held in check on the glass.
“Our main focus was finding a body and boxing out,” Delaney-Smith said. “We held [Lomax] to six rebounds; I’m pretty happy with that.”
“I wasn’t focused so much on getting my own rebounds, but I was just trying to make sure to keep her off the boards,” Markley added.
With Markley’s stellar performance in the paint and a strong supporting cast around the perimeter—guards freshmen Victoria Lippert and junior Jackie Alemany contributed 11 and seven points, respectively—Harvard jumped out to a 20-point advantage with just under six minutes to play, marking its largest lead of the night. From that point on, the Crimson cruised comfortably to its seventh victory at home this season.
Harvard’s 18-point rout of the Lions proved that the Crimson will be a major player for the Ivy title—a prize that last belonged to the squad in 2008.
“We just have to take one game at a time,” Berry said. “We have to play each game like it’s the title game.”
Delaney-Smith pointed out that Harvard had won the title before, even with early losses in conference play, clearly downplaying the heartbreaking 45-44 loss to Dartmouth just two weeks ago.
“Nobody’s going to run the table,” Delaney-Smith said. “Columbia is one of the better teams in the league, and I don’t think anybody is going to run the table, because they’ll have to go through us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No one questions Brogan Berry’s leadership on the court. But it wasn’t until referees questioned her dribbling that the sophomore point guard hit her stride in the Harvard women’s basketball team’s 69-53 win over Cornell (5-12, 0-4 Ivy) Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Berry glided through the Big Red defense for an easy layup to give the Crimson (11-6, 2-1) what would have been a one-point lead, but referees called her for traveling. Unfazed, the sophomore retreated back on defense with a smile. The next possession, she stole the ball from Caitlin Costello and sprinted down the court for another layup. This time when the whistle blew, it sent Berry to the line. She converted the foul shot for the three-point play to put Harvard up, 18-16.
Eight seconds later, Berry struck again with a three-point shot, sending Harvard into halftime with a two-point lead.
“I try to be a leader on the court as best I can and sometimes it involves passing, sometimes it involves scoring,” the sophomore said.
The effort capped off a late-half rally. Cornell hadn’t made any spectacular offensive plays, but the Crimson couldn’t seem to find the basket against its high pressure defense. For much of the first 10 minutes, Harvard seemed out of rhythm as it endured a scoreless streak of more than six minutes, allowing the Big Red to pick up an eight-point lead.
“They came out really strong,” Berry said. “They’re a great team and they got us back on our heels.”
“We weren’t ready for them,” freshman Elle Hagedorn added.
The Crimson co-captains started to turn things around. Junior Claire Wheeler hit a jumper to reduce the deficit to six. Harvard wouldn’t find the basket again for nearly two minutes, but it played lockdown defense and didn’t allow Cornell a tally in that period. Then junior co-captain Christine Matera scored her second of four three-pointers to bring the deficit down to two. By then, it seemed only a matter a time before Harvard took control, which it did following a three-pointer by freshman Victoria Lippert and the back-to-back three-point plays by Berry, the second of which was the Crimson’s last basket of the half.
In the second half, Harvard finally looked the part of the favored team with its usual offensive stars—Matera, Lippert, Berry and junior Emma Markley—hitting their shots. But the Crimson allowed the Big Red to hang around just long enough to tie the game twice before two free throws from junior Jackie Alemany finally put Harvard up for good with 13 minutes to play.
That proved to be the backbreaker for Cornell. Matera struck soon after with her fourth three-pointer of the day, and Hagedorn followed it with back-to-back steals for layups.
“[Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith] just tells me to use my long arms, get in the passing lane,” the freshman said. “I think that’s one of the reasons she puts me in. I see that as one of my key roles on the team.”
More quietly, Matera contributed 16 points. The guard’s four three-pointers were executed so mechanically as to look easy.
“She’s awesome,” Hagedorn said. “It’s great knowing you have a shooter that’s that consistent.”
But the co-captain had the opportunity to add some flair on her final field goal of the night, using a hesitation move to get move to get past Cornell’s defenders. Her last two baskets were free throws.
“We told Chris that she should score 21 because she’s turning 21,” Hagedorn said. “I don’t think she reached that, but she still had a hell of a game.”
Matera’s 16-point effort, the highest of all scorers, put her five short of a 21-point birthday effort. Perhaps to compensate for those five points, she added two assists and three rebounds in the winning effort.
“I was just hoping for a win for my birthday,” she said. “I was just telling all of them that’s all I want for my birthday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the battle between two ECAC giants, the Harvard men’s hockey team (5-11-3, 5-6-3 ECAC) came up just short in Friday night’s matchup against Princeton (8-10-2, 4-8-1), losing, 2-1, at Bright Hockey Center.
The loss snapped the Crimson’s four-game unbeaten streak.
“When you play a team like Princeton, they play a similar style to us where we play solid defensively and don’t give up much,” captain Alex Biega said. “When two teams like that come up together, it’s going to be a battle for the game.”
Harvard and the Tigers certainly kept things close and interesting until the very end. With Princeton leading with just over two minutes to play, Tigers defenseman Brad Schroeder was flagged for a hooking penalty, putting the Crimson on the power play for the rest of the game.
With less than a minute on the clock, Harvard pulled junior goaltender Ryan Carroll, giving itself a two-man advantage in a last-ditch attempt to send the game into overtime.
But Princeton goaltender Zane Kalemba, last year’s ECAC Player of the Year, held strong, stopping five blistering shots on goal in that last minute to give the Tigers their first win at Bright since the 2006-07 season.
“I thought Kalemba was very large in there,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “He’s a guy that has shown in the past that he can stand on his head at times and I think he did in the third period.”
The Crimson held a narrow 35-34 advantage in shots on the game but outshot Princeton, 13-4, down the stretch.
After a slow start to the game, Harvard finally appeared regain the form that had propelled it to success in its last four games. But getting the puck past a resurgent Tigers defense, anchored by Kalemba, proved to be too tall an order for the Crimson.
“Princeton, in general, has been going through a little of what we’ve been going through in terms of having a down season,” Biega said. “But [Kalemba’s] obviously a very skilled goaltender, and he can obviously carry their team...but I still think we should have capitalized on more of our opportunities throughout the game.”
A crucial missed opportunity came early on for Harvard. About halfway through the first period, an attempt at goal by sophomore forward Alex Killorn managed to sneak its way behind Kalemba, but the puck hit the post and didn’t have the power to make its way across the line.
Less than three minutes later, the Tigers got one past Carroll to take a 1-0 lead.
Harvard evened the score five minutes into the second period, thanks to some nifty playmaking by freshman forward Louis Leblanc and a solid finish by classmate Conor Morrison.
Up a man on the power play, Leblanc skated down the left side before passing the puck backwards to an open Morrison, who placed it neatly behind Kalemba to even the score at one.
“Conor’s a very skilled player and...Louis came up and made a nice move on a defenseman and [we] scored off the rush,” Biega said. “We try to use those goals to our advantage and use our speed out wide.”
But the Crimson wasn’t able to build momentum off Morrison’s goal, as Princeton forward Marc Hagel fired a one-timer past Carroll to score his first goal of the season at the end of the second period. The last goal Hagel scored came in the Tigers’ win over Harvard at Hobey Baker Rink on Jan. 3, 2009.
Hagel’s tally proved to be the game-winner, as Kalemba fended off furious Crimson attempts at goal to seal the win for the visitors.
“Princeton’s a dangerous, a very proud team,” Donato said. “They don’t have the success they’ve had over the past couple of years without a lot of character guys.”
Harvard will take a break from ECAC action tonight as it travels across town to TD Garden to take on No. 14 Boston College in the Beanpot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early in the season, the Harvard men’s hockey team needed to fix its problem with late-game lapses.
Mission accomplished.
Friday against Princeton, the Crimson had the opposite problem, as a sluggish first period proved to be the difference-maker.
“I think we could’ve been a little bit more determined early in the game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
The Crimson seemed to lack its usual speed early in the game, which allowed the Tigers to get some odd-man rushes and man-up situations and put the pressure on junior goaltender Ryan Carroll early.
“We got behind the eight ball up in the first,” Donato said. “We kind of let them get some odd-numbered situations and pin us in the zone a few times.”
Heading into the game, one would have expected the Crimson to have the momentum early, as it was riding a four-game unbeaten streak—having knocked off two ranked teams in the process. But it was Princeton who took control from the opening faceoff, outshooting Harvard, 15-11, in the first.
“I thought we started off very flat,” captain Alex Biega said. “Especially in our rink when we’re at home, we usually try to get some momentum on our side and have a great start and go from there.”
Instead, the team found itself playing catch-up after Dan Bartlett scored midway through the period.
The goal proved to be a wake-up call, as Harvard picked up its speed and intensity for the remaining two periods. But all it took was one small defensive lapse to put the Crimson away for good, forcing it to make tough decisions late in the third.
The teams’ even play in the second and third periods couldn’t compensate for the slow start.
“Unfortunately, we just played two of the three periods to our capabilities,” Biega said. “We’ll take it for experience and hopefully move on from it.”
SECRET’S OUT
The Crimson has six NHL draft picks on its roster, but there wasn’t any question which one Princeton feared the most: freshman Louis Leblanc, who had found the back of the net in three of Harvard’s past four games heading into the weekend.
A large part of the Tigers’ game plan seemed to be to protect goaltender Zane Kalemba from Leblanc’s stick.
“He’s going to get special attention,” Donato said. “Especially with a lot of the other guys out of the lineup, even more so.”
But the freshman found a way to use heavy coverage to his advantage in the second period, when he moved the puck through swarming Tigers onto the stick of a wide-open Morrison, who put the puck past Kalemba.
“[Leblanc] made a beautiful play on the first goal, and he had a bunch of chances in and around the net,” Donato said.
In the third period, Leblanc seemed determined to shoulder the Crimson’s load as much as possible, battling in the corners for loose pucks and looking to roll the crease.
But Princeton was always there.
“I thought he was all over the place in a good way,” Donato said. “He does not get turned away easily, he just keeps coming.”
The scoring phenom has distinguished himself over the course of his career with his willingness to engage in physical play.
Perhaps it was fitting, then, that the game closed out with a penalty on Leblanc for roughing. It was the freshman’s 12th penalty of the season.
“He just never gives up,” Donato said. “I thought it was another very strong game by him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—On the eve of arguably the most important game in Harvard men’s basketball history, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker expected his players to stay focused on the task at hand.
Harvard  (14-3, 3-0 Ivy) lived up to its coach’s standards, blowing past Columbia (6-11, 0-3) on the road, 74-45, the night before the Crimson’s much-anticipated matchup against Ivy League favorite Cornell.
“I would have been incredibly disappointed if there was any thought or inclination at all that our kids were looking past anybody,” Amaker said. “That’s not who we are.”
The Crimson stayed true to its identity, leading throughout the game en route to the 29-point trouncing at Francis S. Levien Gymnasium, which allowed Amaker to rest his starters for significant minutes in the second half.
The Lions entered the Friday night contest coming off two lopsided losses to Cornell, but were expected to challenge Harvard with their skilled outside shooting.
Instead, Columbia, which came into the game ranked fifth nationally in three-point percentage, came out flat. The squad shot just 1-of-11 from deep and 33.3% from the field.
“I thought tonight we did a good job of executing our plays—I just feel like we just couldn’t make enough baskets,” Lions coach Joe Jones said. “We had some good looks and didn’t knock them down.”
The Crimson, on the other hand, had six different players knock down shots from beyond the arc, registering an 8-of-16 mark from deep.
Columbia’s shooting woes coupled with Harvard’s balanced offensive attack—nine Crimson players notched at least four points—led to a game that was all but decided at the half, with Harvard entering the break sporting a 15-point advantage.
The Crimson attacked the hoop early on, scoring three baskets in just over a minute of play to take the early 6-0 lead.
Co-captain Jeremy Lin got things started for the Crimson, slipping past his defender on the game’s opening possession for a backdoor layup off a pass from sophomore Oliver McNally.
Harvard’s stingy defense forced two turnovers on the Lions’ opening possessions, and Lin found a path to the basket for the second time, this time elevating over his defender and switching the ball from his right to his left hand before tossing the ball into the hoop.
Lin continued to display his offensive prowess, knocking down a mid-range jumper, a three-pointer, and another layup for 11 points in his first eleven minutes of play on 5-of-5 shooting.
“Jeremy’s performance as usual was sensational,” Amaker said. “I thought he was dynamic in his way of leading us in the first few minutes of the game. I thought he was able to set the tone for our team and we usually feed off the things that he’s capable of doing for us.”
And feed off Lin they did.
After Columbia’s leading scorer Noruwa Agho cut the lead to three with a mid-range jumper and a three pointer from the left wing, the Crimson countered with a 14-7 run that extended its lead to double digits.
Freshman Kyle Casey sparked the Harvard run, rising above his defender and then letting go a three ball that swished through the net. Agho tried to keep the Lions afloat, knocking down a jumper from the left corner, but McNally hit another deep ball on the Crimson’s following possession.
The Harvard bench erupted moments later when Lin gave the Crimson the 24-16 lead after he received a pass from freshman Brandyn Curry a foot beyond the arc and sent it through the hoop.
McNally capped the run with a final three pointer from the left wing that gave Harvard a commanding 29-19 lead with just over six minutes remaining in the first half.
Poor shooting the rest of the way stifled any chances of a Columbia comeback as the Lions were unable to chip away at their 15-point halftime deficit.
As Harvard’s lead grew to 20 midway through the second period, the Crimson starters were granted the unusual reward of rest in preparation for their hyped matchup the next night.
But despite the excitement and significance of the Cornell game looming over its head, Harvard managed to keep its focus and come away with the large victory over its weaker Ivy opponent.
“Saturday night doesn’t have any significance for us if we don’t play well and do our job here on Friday,” Amaker said. “I think it’s the mark of a team that’s maturing and growing to be able take that to heart.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every athlete has a different training routine, and right now for Harvard, they all seem to be working.
On a weekend that the Crimson rested many of its team members, a handful of competitors traveled to the Boston University Track and Tennis Center for the Terrier Invitational, while three women took part in the Harvard Multi-Meet, affording some a chance to post strong times while others rested in preparation for a stretch of big meets.
“For a lot of kids on the team, it’s a long season,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “Each event coach will work to pick and choose spots [to compete] so that everyone is ready when it matters most.”
Those athletes that did take part in the weekend meets certainly seemed prepared, as Harvard racked up three more ECAC qualifications and boasted a personal best.
“[The meets] went really well,” Saretsky said. “It was a good opportunity for some athletes to get in a single event and focus on putting up a mark or a time. We had some very good performances.”
Although the Crimson did not compete as a team, the squad took its ample individual success as a sign of potential for the upcoming weeks.
“As we get into this part of the season, it’s much more about the team trying to do some specific things,” Saretksy said. “Each year we’ve been getting better and better, so we’re excited about the next few [team competitions].”
TERRIER INVITATIONAL
A number of Harvard competitors found success at the large open meet held by Boston University, including three ECAC qualifiers. Junior Eliza Ives and rookie Carlyle Davis had excellent showings in the 5k and 800-meter races, respectively, joining sophomore Darcy Wilson, who earned an ECAC invite in his third event this year. Ives—competing indoors for the first time this season—sped to a 17:14.57 to take seventh place overall, more than six seconds ahead of her nearest competitor.
Davis, who has come on strong the last couple weeks, also notched a formidable time, taking second place in 2:09.44. Despite being a rookie, Davis finished only behind Olympian Erin Donohue in the 77-woman field.
The most impressive effort, though, may have come from Wilson. The second-year runner has put his versatility on display this season, surpassing ECAC marks in the 1000-meter, 800-meter, and mile runs. This weekend featured the mile for Wilson, and he did not hesitate to produce for a third straight week, taking 17th overall in 4:11.79.
“That’s just where my training is at right now,” Wilson said. “I like getting out and competing, and that’s when I’m at my best.”
Qualifying in so many events will prove a mixed blessing for Wilson, though, as the sophomore must soon choose an event to focus on in the conference meets.
“Last year the 1k was my event, so to speak,” Wilson said. “This year I ran [all three events well], so it will involve talking to the coaches about where we’re headed. It will also have to do with where my training goes from here.”
On the other hand, junior Brian Hill, sophomore John Dingus, and freshman Jeff Homer seem all quite sure of their position after top-five showings on Saturday. Hill posted a lifetime best 1:50.80 in the 800, just .63 seconds behind winner Elkana Kosgei. The second-place finish matched Hill’s effort from a week ago, marking consistently-strong showings in his third year.
Dingus and Homer were no less impressive, taking third and fifth respectively in the 500-meter race. Junior Sean Gil also earned second in the pole vault with a jump of 4.56 meters, rounding out the list of quality finishes for the Crimson.
HARVARD MULTI-MEET
Three Crimson competitors filled out a field of 10 pentathletes at Gordon Track over the weekend. Sophomores Nicole Sliva and Christine Reed bested their seeds, finishing just two points apart to take third and fourth in the event. Rookie Mary Hirst—winner in the shot put event—also took ninth in her first multi event. Dartmouth had a comparable showing at the meet, claiming first, fifth, sixth, and eighth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—After last week’s narrow 62-58 win at Dartmouth, Harvard was left scratching its head. The Crimson’s offense was able to create seemingly open looks but shot a season-worst 39.0 percent from the field and 11.8 percent from three.
To its relief, Harvard found its stroke on Friday. The Crimson knocked down its first four shots and did not look back, hitting 55.6 percent on field goals and 50 percent on three-pointers.
The damage on the perimeter came from two unlikely sources. For the first time since November, sophomore guard Oliver McNally hit multiple treys. McNally hit his first three midway through the opening half to extend a four point lead to seven, and minutes later knocked down another to bring the lead to 10.
Sophomore forward Andrew Van Nest experienced a similar run in the second half. The big man hit two threes in the span of a minute—both in front of the Harvard bench—to break the game open. Van Nest had previously been one for his last seven after coming back from a shoulder injury in December.
“We’ve been trying to find a way for him to get back on track,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “His ability, as you witnessed this evening, to stretch the defense and to make open shots is a big weapon.”
Ironically, while Harvard had a prolific scoring night, it was a missed shot, that excited the crowd. Five minutes into the second half, sophomore forward Keith Wright had a wide-open, fast break lay-up. But as he jumped, the ball slipped out of his hands and rocketed off the backboard for a highlight-reel blooper.
MILLER TIME
With senior forward Pat Magnarelli nursing a sprained ankle, Harvard needed to spread his minutes around to the other big men. Van Nest responded by knocking down a pair of open triples, but co-captain Doug Miller filled the void in the paint.
“I thought Doug was tremendous,” Amaker said. “He played strong around the basket.”
Miller, who entered the game averaging 3.3 points per game, scored a season-high eight points, including four of the team’s first 11.
After his initial spurt, Miller was quiet for much of the first half—until the closing seconds. Co-captain Jeremy Lin was in the familiar position of holding for the last shot, but he passed it off to freshman Brandyn Curry, who then found Miller in the post. From the right block, Miller finished a lefty reverse, sending the Crimson into halftime with a 41-26 lead.
On top of his post scoring, Miller provided some needed muscle on the boards, corralling five rebounds as Harvard edged Columbia, 29-25, on the glass.
“He embraces his role and does a tremendous job with that,” Amaker said.
LOPSIDED LIONS
In the first half, the offense that the Lions did generate came almost exclusively from its two guards, Patrick Foley and Noruwa Agho.
The pair combined for 22 of Columbia’s 26 points and took 14 of their 19 shots in the opening frame.
But the second half proved to be far more difficult. Less than a minute into the action, Foley separated his shoulder and left the game.
“It popped out,” Lions coach Joe Jones said. “It’s the shoulder he got surgery on two summers ago...I can’t see him trying to play with that.”
Agho, who started the game hitting four of five shots, missed his next five attempts and did not score in the second half.
“Early in the second half, we thought we were right there, if we could string a couple stops together,” Columbia guard Kevin Bulger said. “We just weren’t able to do that, and that coupled with missing some really makeable shots [made a comeback] difficult.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To be number one, you have to be the best. As Harvard found out on Saturday, the No. 1 Trinity men’s squash team has the top ranking for just that reason.
The Bantams swept the event at their own Kellner Center, overpowering No. 5 Harvard 9-0 with five match-ups ending 3-0 in Trinity’s favor.
“It’s hard to be happy with a 9-0 loss, but at the same time we were quite pleased with the result in terms of how we were competing,” junior Eliot Buchanan said. “It was just those last couple of points in each game that were making the difference, where Trinity was showing a little more discipline, a little more experience.”
Going into play on Saturday, the Crimson knew odds were in the home team’s favor. Trinity, the No. 1 ranked team for the past 10 years, holds the longest winning streak in the history of intercollegiate varsity sports with 217 matches.
“Each of those players, they are in league with professional athletes really,” Buchanan said. “Squash is their priority and they are very physically prepared but more so mentally prepared.”
“They go into every match knowing they will win,” he added. “It’s one thing to think you can win, but they have the experience to go in with special positive attitudes in their mind and that certainly reflects itself in the game.”
Trinity’s shutout started with freshman Zeke Scherl’s loss in the No. 3 position to Trinity co-captain Supreet Singh. Singh took the first two games 11-4, before Scherl came back in the third, going point-for-point until Singh took control, 12-10.
Buchanan, playing at No. 5, faced similar back-and-forth play against the Bantam’s Antonio Diaz Glez as each of their games went into overtime. While Diaz Glez finished with the victory in each game, Buchanan’s play continuously improved. The junior lengthened each overtime before falling 10-12, 11-13, 12-14.
“In one respect I was disappointed because it’s one or two points,” said Buchanan, who just finished a semester abroad away from squash. “I could have come up with a victory there, and one victory from one player leads to another, it’s all about momentum...but from an individual perspective I was very pleased with my performance.”
Unlike Scherl and Buchanan, the opponent of the Crimson’s No. 1 senior Colin West did not need overtime to take control.
Baset Chaudhry, Trinity’s top player, dismissed West in three games 11-6, 11-4, 11-9.
For the intercollegiate squash world, this was the individual match-up to watch with Baset voted No. 1 and West No. 2 in the College Squash Association’s preseason rankings.
“I think the last time Colin played him, he beat him, but we all know that Baset is much more polished then he was three months ago,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said prior to the contest.
As West fell to Baset, two Harvard rookies, No. 9 Alexander Ma and No. 6 Jason Michas, picked up two of the Crimson’s four games won, before losing the next three to their respective opponents. juniors No. 2 Richard Hill and No. 4 J. Reed Endresen also won a game apiece.
“At the end of the day the results are what matters, and each of us sort of faltered a little bit when we had the lead,” Buchanon said. “When we had the opportunity to close up the game we just couldn’t quite push that extra step.”
Despite losing 9-0, Harvard plans to take the positives of playing a top-caliber opponent into next weekend’s double-header against No. 8 University of Pennsylvania and No. 4 Princeton.
“Playing Trinity yesterday was obviously a huge privilege, but really it’s a non-conference match-up,” Buchanan said. “With that said, Penn, Princeton, and Yale are all huge matches. They are crucial because one loss will put us outside of our goal for the Ivy League title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—The opening possession of Saturday night’s match up between men’s basketball heavyweights Cornell and Harvard was a fairly simple play.
The Big Red’s All-Ivy big man Jeff Foote received the ball in the post, paused, and then found a wide-open Chris Wroblewski, who drained a three-pointer and sent the home crowd into a frenzy.
Though only eight seconds had passed—and Crimson freshman guard Christian Webster would respond with a three of his own—the Crimson’s inability to defend the seven-foot Foote and prevent Cornell’s sharpshooters from getting open looks at the basket would haunt the road team until the final buzzer.
By all accounts, Foote, the most dominant big man in the Ancient Eight, stuffed the box score while stuffing dunks all over the opposition’s frontcourt personnel.
Harvard starters Keith Wright and Doug Miller, clearly at a sizeable physical disadvantage, were unable to stop the Big Red center from backing down his defender and lofting hooks and layups with ease.
Playing in only their second career league game on the road, reserves Andrew Van Nest and Kyle Casey proved to be even less effective on the interior.
The loss of senior forward Pat Magnarelli to a high-ankle sprain sustained last week at Dartmouth certainly did not help the Crimson’s efforts.
“This was a game where we really had to utilize Jeff,” Cornell coach Steve Donahue said. “They scramble around so well on defense that if you continue to do that, it wears you down. We have the luxury of just slowing things down, dumping it inside, making them guard.”
Mostly facing a single defender, Foote still managed to find the open man out on the perimeter—a strength shared by his teammates, as Harvard’s defensive troubles extended beyond just dealing with the big man.
The Big Red distributed the ball with incredible efficiency, continually finding its shooters good opportunities with dribble-drive penetration and stellar perimeter passing on the way to 22 assists.
The talent that had led Cornell to two consecutive Ivy titles was on full display. The 2007-08 Ivy Player of the Year Louis Dale used his quickness to get into the lane, either finishing at the hoop or passing to teammates on the outside. The Crimson’s perimeter defenders often failed to rotate quickly enough, giving the high-powered Big Red offense a chance to flex its muscles.
GIVING IT AWAY
The Crimson turned the ball over 30 times in a loss to Army, and for much of the game, it seemed the squad was intent on reaching that milestone again.
Harvard amassed 14 turnovers in the first half alone, doing so in almost every way possible.
Whether it was drawing offensive fouls, stripping penetrators on dribble drives, or picking off simply lazy passes, Cornell applied a defensive pressure that the opposing squad could not handle.
“They were very aggressive, they took us out of anything we wanted to run and knocked the ball off of us,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Obviously having 25 turnovers and only seven assists is not a very good formula for positive basketball.”
Many of the give-aways—which led to 29 points for the opposition—resulted from a team-wide inability to hold onto the ball. Passes repeatedly went off of hands, dribbles went awry, and the raucous Newman Arena crowd ate it up.
As a result, Harvard struggled mightily on the offensive end. One of the league’s top offenses never found a stable rhythm and only took 32 shots from the field, compared to Cornell’s 66.
Giving up no fast break points, the Big Red also stopped Harvard from pushing the ball up into the open floor, one of the team’s strengths.
And the Crimson’s half-court offense ran into plenty of problems of its own, as the lack of a legitimate post presence and clutch shooters crippled the visitng team.
“We have guys that can guard on the perimeter and you have a kid like Jeff waiting there, so it’s difficult to keep penetrating, which they do,” Donahue explained.
On a night when the long-distance shots weren’t falling—the squad shot 33 percent from three—and Foote was bullying his way around inside, only Lin was able to successfully get into the lane and finish at the basket.
Harvard totaled 14 points in the paint to Cornell’s 32.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overcoming challenges is the measure of a true champion, and after this weekend, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (5-0, 3-0 Ivy) has further cemented its status as a true contender for the national title.
The Crimson traveled to No. 2 Trinity on Saturday and took on No. 6 Stanford at home yesterday morning. Coming into the weekend, Harvard was undefeated, winning all of its games by 9-0 margins. The matchups weren’t as easy this weekend, but the results still fell in the Crimson’s favor. Harvard beat Trinity, 7-2, and defeated Stanford the next day by a score of 8-1.
“We never know what outside of the Ivy League is going to bring to us,” Crimson coach Satinder Bajwa said. “Stanford is another example. I think Trinity made us much more ready for Stanford today. Before the matches, I told the girls, ‘Nobody gives you anything, you have to go out and win it.’”
HARVARD 8, STANFORD 1
Just a day after beating the Bantams, the Crimson welcomed Stanford to Barnaby Courts.
The match that first took place on center court was the meeting between sophomore Nirasha Guruge and the Bantams’ Pamela Chua. Guruge had to battle her way through the first sets only to be halted in the second and third sets. Chua kept her cool, even after dropping the fourth game to a defiant but tired Guruge, and won the matchup in the fifth set, 9-11, 13-11, 11-9, 7-11, 11-7. This was the second day in a row that Guruge was forced to go to five games, but luck wasn’t on her side this time around.
“I think Nirasha would win that match next time—it’s not a match that she can’t win,” Bajwa said. “But she played a five-game match yesterday and she had to work very hard to win that match, and today she lost a little edge from having to play yesterday.”
Freshman Laura Gemmell took care of business right after the Guruge-Chua match, and she put away Katy Brewster in three sets, 11-8, 11-3, 11-5.
In another five-set match, junior June Tiong demonstrated her resolve after falling behind 2-0 to Kerrie Sample. The first game was a heartbreaker, 13-11, followed by an 11-8 loss. The third game was another close contest, but this time Tiong proved to be the victor as the game went to 15 points.
Tiong gained momentum as she also took the fourth game, 11-7, leading to a highly-contested fifth game. Sample did not let up easily, but Tiong overcame her opponent’s kill shots to take the win, 14-12.
HARVARD 7, TRINITY 2
The Bantams were not in the mood to let the Crimson blemish their nine-game win streak on Saturday. Harvard was not going to let its chance to solidify its ranking as No. 1 in the nation slip away. But in its toughest match yet, the Crimson also had to adjust to a new environment.
“[Saturday], what we had was different conditions,” Bajwa said. “So when you play against Trinity, they’re the only one with panel courts. Their glass courts are different colors. So the girls had a hard time adjusting to the conditions, so we lost a couple of matches. That’s all. In terms of if they were to play again, every one of them is capable of winning their match at a neutral place.”
Gemmell once again shone at the top position, winning in three straight sets against Pamela Hathway, 11-6, 11-6, 11-7. The rookie has been reliable thus far, winning all of her matches with relative ease.
The three and four spots suffered the first losses of the year for Harvard. Trinity’s Nour Baghat got the best of Tiong, taking all three sets for the win, 11-6, 11-7, 11-7. Junior Alisha Mashruwala couldn’t turn the tide in her favor in the second set, falling to the Bantams’ Tehani Guruge, 11-2, 11-9, 11-6.
Another Guruge who had a stellar day played on Harvard’s side, as the sophomore faced Nayelly Hernandez Perez in a five-game thriller. Like Tiong on Sunday, Guruge came back to win it from two games down, 6-11, 7-11, 12-10, 12-10, 11-6.
“I lost the first two sets, and in the third set I was match ball down,” Guruge said. “I was still able to come back and it was a great match for me.”
The top-ranked Crimson will face Ivy League rivals Penn and Princeton next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—What was billed as the premier Ivy League matchup of the season failed to live up to the hype.
Instead of a back-and-forth battle between two title contenders, the sold-out crowd at Cornell’s Newman Arena witnessed the most lopsided Ivy League game of the season.
Rather than challenging the Big Red (18-3, 4-0 Ivy) for league dominance, the Harvard men’s basketball team (14-4, 3-1 Ivy) was trounced 86-50 in the Crimson’s worst loss since 2007.
“We didn’t play up to our capabilities and in a game like this, against a team like Cornell in this environment, we obviously need to play much better,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Whether it was the raucous crowd, the game’s high stakes, Cornell’s stifling defense, or a combination of those factors, the young Crimson team was knocked out of its offensive rhythm, turning the ball over 25 times and shooting 36.1% from the field.
“We did everything we wanted to do defensively to make them struggle,” Big Red coach Steve Donahue said. “I do think we have the ability with our depth, our size, our experience, of being able to cause things like that on defense.”
Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin struggled to control the ball, turning it over eight times. Lin had more success scoring, finishing with a game-high 19 points. But with no other Crimson players reaching double figures, Harvard failed to keep pace with a dynamic Big Red offense that had five different players finish with at least 10 points.
Seven-foot center Jeff Foote led Cornell with 16 points, nine rebounds, and four assists, scoring most of his baskets on post moves in the paint—including two flushes—against the Crimson’s undersized big men.
“I just felt like I had a little bit of an advantage,” Foote said. “I was catching it deep and getting good position. Today I was able to slow myself down, really gather myself, and go into my moves that I’m effective with.”
Amaker threw a number of different defensive looks at Foote in an attempt to slow the big man down. Amaker sent four different forwards to cover Foote man-to-man throughout the game and also switched to zone defense on several possessions.
But it was to no avail, as the reigning defensive player of the year was able to have his way on offense, knocking down 7-of-11 shots from the field.
“As we went through the scouting report, I mentioned I thought he’s the key to their team,” Amaker said. “I think he does so much dirty work. He scores on the inside; He’s a great passer, a very unselfish big man. I’m very fond of his game.”
On the other side of the ball, the Big Red attempted to slow Harvard’s strongest offensive player, Lin, by limiting his touches or doubling off screens to force the All-Ivy player into sending the ball to his teammates—or out of bounds.
Lin’s teammates failed to make the defense pay when Cornell double-teamed, as they collectively shot just 26% from the field.
Despite the offensive and defensive struggles and lopsided outcome, the Crimson was not without opportunities to get itself back in the game.
Cornell got out to a hot start, hitting its first six shots to open the contest, and a Foote spin move followed by a lefty floater over Harvard sophomore Andrew Van Nest gave the Big Red a 19-10 lead just under six minutes into the game.
But Harvard countered with a 7-0 run sparked by a layup from sophomore Keith Wright. Moments later, freshman Dee Giger knocked down an open deep ball to get within two after Wright recovered an offensive rebound and sent it back out to the wingman on the perimeter.
Cornell’s Mark Coury blew a layup on the Big Red’s next possession and the Crimson came away with the ball—and the opportunity to tie the score or take the lead.
Lin found Van Nest beyond the arc, but the big man’s shot attempt—Harvard’s only attempt in the game to take the lead—clanged off the rim.
Foote finished with a dunk on the other end, starting a 16-0 run for the Big Red, which would take a 38-24 lead into the break.
Six points from Lin to start the second half got the deficit back down to 10, but the Crimson would never get closer than that, as Cornell cruised to the 36 point victory.
“I think they’re an outstanding basketball team,” Amaker said. “One of the better teams in the country from what I’ve been able to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams finished their last regular-season matches in perfect fashion Saturday at the Eric Sollee Invitational in Waltham, Mass.
The men (8-5) finished the day with two wins, defeating Air Force, 17-10, and Haverford, 23-4, while the women also swept the same opponents, 24-3 and 21-6.
Although the Crimson’s competitors were unranked and less of a challenge at the start of the day, both fencing teams ultimately finished victorious.
“Every meet we have, whether it is strong competition or not, we always find a way to work on something we need to improve,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It doesn’t matter who we are fencing. This was mostly about focus.”
Sophomore epee James Hawrot was a spark for the men Saturday, leading his weapon to a 9-0 win over Haverford and keying a 5-4 win against Air Force. Hawrot defeated senior Falcon Peter French, who, according to Brand, is one of the top epee fencers in the nation.
Joining Hawrot in the spotlight was freshman sabre Thomas Kolasa. The rookie led the sabre team over the Falcons and Fords, 6-3 and 8-1, respectively.
“Thomas Kolasa in sabre has really come a long way in terms of being able to consistently do well and control his bouting, both emotionally and physically,” Brand said. “He’s made some good adjustments.”
Kolasa’s performance helped his weapon to victory, even with an off weekend from sophomore star Valentin Staller.
But Brand recognizes the difficulties mentally and physically in fencing and has no doubts about Staller’s resilience.
“It was just one of those days,” Brand said about the sophomore sabre. “I’m confident [Staller] will be successful in the long run.”
Junior foil Hao Meng had a standout performance as the foil team notched 6-3 wins over both schools.
Brand applauded the junior’s focus throughout the day, acknowledging that although Meng was not competing against the most formidable opponents, he knew what was needed to get the job done.
“Hao Meng was one of our foil fencers who had been struggling,” Brand said. “His performance yesterday really seemed to show him breaking through some mental barriers.”
But it was Harvard’s women (9-5) who really shined in Saturday’s performance, bouncing back after a disappointing showing at last week’s St. John’s Invitational.
Once again, it was sophomore co-captain Caroline Vloka who put together another stellar performance in the sabre, going undefeated through the two matches.
The women’s sabre team finished 8-1 versus both Air Force and Haverford. Following suit was the epee team, which defeated the Falcons, 7-2, and the Fords, 5-4.
The women’s foil was the most successful weapon on Saturday, only losing one bout in defeating Air Force, 9-0, and Haverford, 8-1. Freshman foil Katherine Chou added another standout performance for her squad.
“We have a really solid foil squad,” said sophomore co-captain Noam Mills, who went 4-2 on the day for the epee squad.
“Kathy came in as a freshman and didn’t get a lot of chances at the beginning of the year,” she added. “Now that she’s getting the chances, she wants to prove to Coach she can do it.”
Even with the Crimson’s success, Brand admitted that there is a lot of work to do before the next competition.
“Fencing, it’s a long road,” Brand said. “You take any little gain you can build on and hope that the person has learned something and will get stronger as the season continues.”
Last Saturday was the end of the regular season for the Crimson, as its next competition will be for the Ivy Championship title.
In three weeks’ time, Harvard will begin competition against Cornell, Penn, and Yale in Ithaca, N.Y.

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had a disappointing finish to its regular season this past weekend, failing to keep its perfect record intact at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.
At the HYP meet, the Crimson’s most important regular season contest, Harvard fell to perennial swim powerhouse and Ivy League rival Princeton, 203-150. The Crimson was able to pull out a definitive win over Yale, 242-106, moving its record to 7-2 overall and 6-1 in conference action.
“We had some really strong swims and there were a lot of in-season best times in this meet,” said senior distance standout Mason Brunnick. “We had a lot of depth, but we weren’t winning certain events we needed to be winning to [beat Princeton].”
Harvard’s distance lane racked up significant points for the Crimson, dominating in the 500-yard and 1650-yard freestyle events. Brunnick led the charge in the 500, where Harvard claimed the top four finishes.
Brunnick captured the gold with a time of 4:26.82, followed by co-captain Alex Meyer at 4:29.06. Junior Blake Lewkowitz and sophomore Matt McLean brought home third and fourth for the Crimson, respectively.
Harvard also recorded a 1-2-3 finish in the 1650-yard freestyle. This time Meyer was at the front of the pack, touching the wall in 15:13.80 and lapping Princeton’s strongest mile swimmer in the event.
Lewkowitz claimed second with a 15:33.66 race, a hundredth of a second faster than Brunnick, who placed third with a time of 15:33.67.
“The distance lane has become a Harvard tradition. We have one of the top distance lanes in the country year in and year out,” co-captain Tommy Gray said. “Alex [Meyer] and Mason [Brunnick] have really gotten the job done all year.”
In addition to its distance stars, the Crimson drew on a collective effort from the relay teams to bolster its score. Junior Jordan Diekema, rookie Owen Wurzbacher, sophomore Nicholas Tan, and junior Eric Taylor sprinted to a second-place finish in the 200-yard medley relay—the first event of the meet—while Brunnick, McClean, and freshmen classmates Brendan McIntee and Greg Pelton posted a 3:04.38 to take third in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
The diving duo of freshman Michael Stanton and junior Zac Ranta also had a strong showing this past weekend. Stanton placed first in the 3-meter dive with 339.55 points, while Ranta brought home second with a 332.00. Harvard fell to Princeton and Yale in the 1-meter event, though, as Stanton just managed to capture third.
The Crimson picked up a few more place finishes, but was ultimately thwarted by the Tigers, who had a sizeable advantage in the sprinting and relay events.
Brunnick upset Princeton’s Jon Hartmann to place in his fourth event of the day, claiming the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:39.29. But even with Brunnick’s win, the Tigers captured the next six places in the event.
“Mason Brunnick winning the 200 freestyle was huge,” Gray said. “He came up and beat [Princeton] in an event that they were definitely supposed to win.”
Meanwhile Diekema, who has been battling injuries and sickness all year, returned for his first meet of the season and added a win in the 100-yard backstroke, touching the wall in 49.65.
Sophomore Niall Janney picked up the 400-yard individual medley with a time of 3:56.47 to wrap up the Crimson’s first place finishes.
Harvard will have one chance for retribution, as it faces Princeton again in the Ivy League Championships, held in the Tigers’ home pool in early March.
“We know that we have enough depth to beat them, we just need to be on our game when it comes down to it,” Brunnick said. “This definitely puts us in a position where we can’t be complacent about how we swam this weekend—we had some good swims, but we need to get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team finished its Ivy dual season with an impressive 6-1 record after the annual HYP meet on Saturday. The Crimson (6-1, 6-1 Ivy) defeated Yale (6-3, 4-2), 180-120, but suffered a loss against conference rival Princeton (6-0, 6-0), 196-102 at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J.
“The meet in Princeton was the first time all year that we’ve come against a challenge,” Harvard coach Stephanie Morawski said. “We’ve skated through the invitational swimming very well, but Princeton caught us by surprise.”
The team was led by junior Jenny Reese, who won both the one- and three-meter diving events in the meet.
“[Jenny] did extremely well this weekend,” Morawski said. “We have always had depth in diving, but rarely a frontrunner. She has worked so hard and is a leader on a young squad.”
Reese was forced to sit out much of last season due a knee injury, but based on her performance in this weekend’s competition, she’s making up for lost time.
“She is really stepping up and following her words with action,” Morawski continued. “It’s  a real sign of how much talent she has and what she is capable of doing to come back this season and perform like this.”
Reese won the three-meter event by nearly 20 points, while she edged out Yale’s Paige Meneses by just 1.2 points on the lower board. Sophomore Leslie Rea placed fourth on the three-meter and sixth on the one-meter.
Also contributing strong performances for the Crimson were freshmen Ellie Johnson and Kelly Robinson and juniors Katy Hinkle and Ali Slack, who made up the 400-yard freestyle relay team that took first in its event. The foursome finished with a time of 3:28.35 to edge out its Bulldog competitors by just under three seconds.
Princeton’s top team would have won the race in 3:25.87, but with the meet’s results already decided, the Tigers swam the relay as an exhibition.
“We fought really hard this weekend,” Robinson said. “The meet bodes well for our chances at the championships...and showed how strong we are as a team.”
Aside from her victory in the relay, Robinson also posted two runner-up finishes in the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard butterfly with times of 23.81 seconds and 55.25 seconds, respectively.
Further place-holders were co-captain Alexandra Clarke, who finished third in the 1000-yard freestyle, junior Chrisine Kaufmann, who placed second in the 500-yard freestyle, and sophomore Meghan Leddy, who was runner up in the 200-yard backstroke.
Another standout for the Harvard squad was junior Kate Mills, who had three top-three finishes in the 200-yard butterfly, 200-yard freestyle, and 200-yard individual medley.
Mills’ 1:58.76 in the butterfly was good enough for third place and an NCAA “B” cut .
“We have a very, very deep team, and it really came out this weekend,” Mills said. “Once we get together and are fully rested, there really will be no stopping us.”
The Tigers were propelled by co-captain Alicia Aemisseger, a 10-time All-American. Individually, Aemisseger took the 200-yard butterfly in pool-record time and won the 1000-yard freestyle in 9:37.27—18 seconds ahead of runner-up Aislinn Smalling.
Aemissiger also touched the wall first in the 500-yard freestyle, besting runner-up Kaufmann by almost 14 seconds.
Princeton is now in position to claim its fourth-straight dual-meet title if it can hold off Columbia on Friday. The Crimson will have another opportunity to compete against the Tigers at the Ivy League Championships in late February, when it hopes to repeat last year’s victory.
“This weekend, we learned what we need to work on over the next month towards the championship,” Slack said. “The straight wins we had brought us together, but the loss has truthfully motivated us even more for the end of the season.”
For Morawski, the final meet against Princeton will not only be a test of her team’s skill, but also of its character.
“Princeton is certainly going to be swimming off a huge confidence booster,” Morawski said. “It shows your character and how tough you are to dust yourself off, come back, and fight for a win.”
“Our focus now is finishing the season with an Ivy championship,” Robinson echoed. “We have dominated in all our other meets, so I think the rest of our season is in the bag.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the end of the season looming, the Harvard men’s hockey team has a shot at redemption against local rival Boston College, who defeated the Crimson in a close 3-2 match in early December. The Beanpot game, scheduled today at TD Garden, will measure how far the Harvard team has come from the 10-game losing streak it was on when it last faced the Eagles. Since playing Boston College, the Crimson has improved its record from 1-8-2 to 5-11-3.
Although Harvard had a 27-26 shot advantage over the Eagles, Boston College scored two goals in less than three minutes in the first period, building a lead the Crimson could not overcome. After a netminder change in the second period, the Eagles were unable to score again, but with three goals already on the board, the damage had been done.
For Harvard to win in the rematch, it will need to generate the momentum it had in the waning minutes of the first game, and carry it through all three periods. Coming off a loss to conference rival Princeton, the setting is familiar. Boston College will have the chance to continue a Crimson losing streak once again.

The popular finance blog 24/7 Wall St. threw a couple stones at Fair Harvard last night, calling our endowment "by a wide margin the worst managed endowment." Ouch.
The National Association of College and University Business Officers recently released an analysis legitimizing common knowledge about the suckiness of our endowment, but 24/7 Wall St. took it a step further, calling us the worst at managing money (based on both percent and absolute dollar loss) among 842 institutions with endowments greater than $1 billion.
The article noted that this is “ironic” because Harvard boasted to the alumni and media about the "brilliance" of those who managed the endowment. Because Harvard people are supposed to be like, all smart or whatever, you know?
Now, we’d all just like to call 24/7 Wall St. a big bully. The kind of institution that swaggers onto the university playground, walks up to bright-eyed and defenseless Harvard, pokes him in the chest, and calls him “Worst Managed Endowment” just to see him cry. But does the bully have a point? Or is it simplistic to assume that having the largest loss automatically means our endowment is the "worst managed"?
Maybe no university minds being at the top of a list, even if the statistics that accompany the top spot are a $10.9 billion-dollar loss and -29.8 percent change in endowment market value. And sure, we’re accustomed to Yale, Stanford, and Princeton being behind us...but then again, endowment mismanagement is one area we don't really want to dominate.
