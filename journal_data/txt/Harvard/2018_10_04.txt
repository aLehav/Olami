After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After my senior year of high school, my parents finally triumphed in their four-year campaign to make me clean my room. I’m not gross, or a slob. Just a hoarder who never threw away a single sheet of paper. By graduation, my slowly-growing mass of pages sprawled across the floor and under my bed, far beyond the pile that was born freshman year. All the pencil marks were smeared by time and friction, the edges ripping under shoe prints, the creases collecting dust.
I’ve always kept things because I could never feel sure they were useless. I thought that, years later, I would nostalgically relive every essay and equation. But while I dutifully boxed away the chronicle of my high school life, only the doodles caught my eye. They were everywhere. Gardens of little flowers creeping up the margins, eyeballs staring in rows between paragraphs, absurd comic strips interspersed with lecture notes. I couldn’t remember drawing any of them, but now I realized how many hours I must’ve spent. And how deliberately I forgot them.
Because doodles meant laziness and boredom. They were only allowed to inhabit the blank spaces. Overlooked when I flipped back to study old notes. Erased when I needed more room. They were separate, unimportant, a distraction from my real work.
That was a terrible realization to have while sitting on the newly bare floor of my bedroom, where I could remember scattering crayons at age four, stapling my first homemade picture book soon after, planning my future as an author-and-illustrator by middle school. Art had shaped and colored in my childhood, but by the end of high school, I’d confined it to the borders of my notebooks and the margins of my life.
And art meets the same fate in so many other lives. As kids, we’re all encouraged to be messy and imaginative. We produce an abundance of scribbled stick figures, gaudy pom-pom crafts, glitter-glued pipe cleaners. We make art with no need for purpose, no fear of judgment.
But at some point, everything shifts. In seeps an uneasy awareness of the other sets of eyes evaluating everything we create. The world starts telling us that we are no longer coloring, or crafting, or doing anything else for its own sake — now, there are grades, scores, prizes, and adults who praise and criticize. We, too, learn to watch with critical eyes, evaluating other people and ourselves. And many of us learn that, if we want to thrive and succeed, we need to be “good” at something — and avoid being “bad” at anything else.
Like all our other pursuits, art can be divided into “good” and “bad.” But art is overwhelmingly classified as something we’re “bad” at, because it is often misinterpreted as an innate talent, rather than a skill that can be honed with practice, such as school, music, or sports. And in a community as competitive and success-driven as Harvard, so many of us only make time for the things we believe we can improve upon or become “good” at. As a result, we’re pushed away by the idea that something like art requires unattainable talent, that we aren’t and will never be “good” enough at it to feel that longed-for euphoria of success and of standing out from others.
This misconception of art is exacerbated by the “starving artist” trope, which tells us that only a tiny elite is capable of securing financial stability through art, and that we are not part of it. We come to accept that making “bad” art not only brings us a sense of personal failure, but can drag us into economic ruin. And so art’s inherent riskiness constitutes yet another reason to drift away from it. At Harvard in particular, the “starving artist” trope is fueled by a culture that equates success with financial prosperity after graduation. As we watch our classmates pursuing lucrative finance and consulting jobs, or pursue them for ourselves, our priorities come under pressure. Time is a limited resource that must be spent productively, so we push to spend our time on profitable pursuits — things that we’re “good” at — since these alone provide a route to success.
It’s not like art was ever our one true calling. Not everyone who liked drawing as a kid should want to become a professional artist. We have so many other passions and things we’re “good” at, and each of us must figure out how to hone in on a particular path that fulfills us and leads to success. But as we grow up and those passions grow stronger, art becomes wrongfully sidelined.
The loss of art in our lives parallels countless other sacrifices we make to pursue our conceptions of success. At Harvard, many students never get enough sleep, don’t have the energy to take care of their mental and physical health, can’t find the time to be mindfully alone. We don’t make room in our schedules to go outside and exercise, to practice that instrument we played in high school, to read a book for pleasure. And we can’t squeeze art in, either.
Like so many other sacrificed things, art is incredibly important, even (and especially) when it is entirely unrelated to our primary interests. For the process of making art is inherently enriching, even when there’s nothing to be gained externally, and regardless of whether we’re “good” at it. Our imagination, storytelling, and awareness of the world around us flourish when we exercise our creativity. As kids, we had not yet learned to care if our art was “good” enough. And now that we’re growing up, we should once again recognize art’s true value, strive to always make more “bad” doodles, and consciously free them from the margins of our lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University community learned on Sep. 27 that Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira had decided to delay publishing the results of a health survey sent to all undergraduates last spring. Instead, Barreira indicated that he intends to host interactive forums meant to engage and inform students on interpretations of the data.
We disagree with the decision to delay publication of the survey results and call on the University to release the data. If the data have been collected, analyzed, and are ready for presentation, as Barreira states is the case, then the student body has a right to access this information — particularly because the survey concerns public health and our own physical safety. The University should still hold Barreira’s proposed in-person forums, but as a way to discuss the findings of the survey and its subsequent analysis — not as a way to release the information to students. With this approach, those who are able or willing to attend the forums will be able to deepen their understanding, and those who are not will not be left in the dark.
If the University is concerned about its image, it should release the data anyway. The very fact that the University is withholding these data may suggest that it is hiding disagreeable data from the community. If this is not the case, HUHS ought to release the data immediately to dispel these concerns; if it is the case, HUHS ought to release the data to inform students of any health problems in our community. Above all, the University should prioritize the health of its students. Therefore, if the data depict a grim picture of student health at Harvard, the University should have even more reason to release them. The community should be aware of any serious public health issues that the University is confronting. At the same time, the proposed public forums can be used to fully explain the data, and perhaps give full context to any disagreeable data.
Additionally, it is especially important that the University release these results given Harvard’s difficulty with handling issues of mental health in the past and the renewed focused on the issue recently.
Ultimately, all that we ask is that the University be transparent about student health statistics. Regardless of whether or not there exist serious population-level issues, the community has a right to be immediately aware of any prominent public health trends. Consequently, we call on Barreira and HUHS to release the full and unfettered results of the survey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the recent news that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh will not teach at Harvard Law School next semester is an encouraging development, Harvard’s response to the allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him has been wholly inadequate.
Instead of announcing that Kavanaugh’s position would be terminated or, at the very least, that his status would be contingent upon the outcome of an exhaustive investigation, University President Lawrence S. Bacow indicated that Kavanaugh made a personal decision not to teach next semester. We draw two conclusions from Bacow’s remarks: The mobilizations of Harvard students against Kavanaugh have been effective, and Harvard’s administration has stopped short of investigating and firing Kavanaugh.
Harvard has an obligation to clearly articulate its position on Kavanaugh. We should not be left to wonder whether someone accused of sexual assault will be invited to teach on campus in the future, nor whether the allegations he faces had any bearing on the termination of his lectureship. This ambiguity is, at best, a missed opportunity for the University to show its commitment to supporting victims of sexual assault. At worst, it constitutes yet another example of Harvard failing to take abuse and misogyny seriously.
Time and time again, Harvard has shown its inability to hold abusers accountable. We saw this in the decades-long defense of Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez, who is accused of repeatedly groping students and faculty members, and more recently in the firing of Mayli Shing, who was terminated for “insubordinate conduct” after she made allegations of workplace racism and sexism. These events are not isolated, but rather indicative of an institution that has failed to meet the standards demanded by its student body.
Kavanaugh currently faces credible accusations of sexual assault and misconduct from three women. These accusations, anchored by the moving testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, have given the University sufficient grounds to terminate his position. A rushed FBI investigation may satisfy the rancorous and partisan Senate, but Harvard must be held to a higher standard.
Any claims that Kavanaugh should receive the benefit of the doubt ought to be laid to rest after last Thursday’s hearing. He repeatedly lied under oath and distorted statements from key witnesses. It remains to be seen whether having done so will secure his appointment to the Supreme Court, but brazen distortions in a hearing about accusations of attempted rape should disqualify him from teaching at an institution that claims the motto “Veritas.”
As The Crimson Editorial Board rightly argued, Harvard should be the voice of survivors, not perpetrators. If the news of Kavanaugh’s absence on campus offers solace to victims of abuse, that sigh of relief is cut short by the prospect of his eventual return. Is the basis for Kavanaugh not returning a schedule conflict on one of his many infamous calendars? Or is it due to his alleged abuse? This distinction matters to those who have been awakened by the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. The looming possibility of inviting an accused abuser back to campus is an affront to victims of sexual violence everywhere.
Anger at Kavanaugh is brewing across the country. Crucially, many have translated this anger into powerful direct action. At his snarling testimony last Thursday, Kavanaugh bemoaned the prospect of never teaching again. Thanks to student-led walkouts, public statements, petitions, and last week’s speakout, he surely recognized his return to campus would not have been a welcome one, and he showed himself the door.
A Kavanaugh-free campus is a victory for survivors and those who stand with them, but the conditions of his retreat have implications for the struggle against sexual assault moving forward. Perpetrators should not be granted discretion over the terms of their departure. We should settle for nothing less than Harvard dismissing Kavanaugh indefinitely.
As members of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences International Socialists, we will speak out against Kavanaugh, as others have in Washington D.C., New York City, New Haven, and Boston. We encourage all concerned members of the Harvard community to join demonstrations on campus and to organize in opposition to Judge Kavanaugh. We believe protests in the streets can prevent Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Time’s up, Harvard!

Amanda Zhang ’21 describes today’s outfit as more “femme” than usual: a white knee-length dress with thin black straps and doodles of faces and profiles gracing its fabric. As she dresses each morning and walks to class, she often wonders, “Is someone going to take me seriously as a student?" Zhang explains that women or people of color who “differ from the kind of person who’s always gone to Harvard” have to reckon with their identity expression on an everyday basis.
Zhang says she realized that there is a “public sort of ethos that goes along with [Harvard’s] history” early in her career as a college student. “When I think of my family in Asia, and you ask them, ‘What's a good school?’, they say, ‘Harvard.’ You'll ask them, ‘What do Harvard students dress like?’, and they will say, ‘This.’”
“This” Ivy League look refers to four white male students walking under a gothic stone arch in plaid shorts and greyscale sweaters with collars peeking out — the exact image that appears on the original cover of “Take Ivy.” Founded in 1965, “Take Ivy” was a survey of collegiate American fashion created by Japanese photographers who wanted to introduce the style to Asia. They traveled up and down the East coast documenting the outfits of Ivy League students. A cursory flip through the book shows page after page of white men wearing rugby shirts, Bermuda shorts, and boat shoes strolling around brick buildings and grassy quads.
When she was in high school, Zhang found an online video that the “Take Ivy” photographers had produced in conjunction with the book. The images stuck with her even after she became an Ivy League student herself: for her final project as a Houghton Library Book Arts fellow this summer, she dug up a copy of “Take Ivy” in Widener. The book’s cover was missing, so Zhang was inspired to update and redesign the original cover. Her new cover obscures most of the original image, leaving only the title and the top of the arch visible.
When she arrived at Harvard, Zhang discovered the same tension between Ivy League style and self-expression that she had seen in the pages of the magazine. During her freshman year, Zhang took a class called “Fashion and Slavery” that pushed her to think about the issue in an academic setting. While many conceive of the stereotypical Harvard professor as someone who prefers collared shirts and pressed slacks, “Fashion and Slavery” challenged many of those ideas — her professor regularly sported “jean overalls and Nikes to class as professional wear.” This questioning of institutional conventions via clothing prompted “a lot of discussions in that class about what clothing means and how it can be used as a symbol of resistance and how it tells stories,” Zhang says.
Her curiosity about how institutional support influences “personal” style grew into her project on “Take Ivy.” In the course of her research, she was struck by how a physical book in Widener can academically legitimize a subject, and she became determined to produce a book that would one day have a place in Widener’s stacks — because “it's another one of those ways of making fashion stories legitimate and intellectually rigorous.”
Though her fellowship ended in August, Zhang has continued to work on her project. She’s planned a series of sit-down interviews and photo shoots with Ivy League students. She describes the interviews as casual conversations, guided by the question: “What led you to dress the way you did today?” The goal is to document these exchanges over the course of the year and compile them into a book by next summer; eventually, she plans to revamp the original creators’ vision by incorporating more technologically advanced components, documenting her art on a blog or an Instagram account.
Zhang emphasizes that redefining Ivy League style will require understanding the individual experience as opposed to a generalized Harvard experience. “It's very hard to get something like Harvard to change in the minds of an entire generation of people,” she explains, “but it's much easier to showcase that individuals are making their own unique choices to make Harvard different.” She believes that the only way to do this is to speak on a personal level with many people. “The heart of this project is sitting down with people… which really speaks to how Harvard is becoming a far more diverse community that needs to collaborate in effective ways,” she says.

When I first visited the Smith Campus Center three weeks ago, I settled into one of the orange, mock-papasan chairs on the second floor right above Pavement Coffee. Maybe it’s because I’m shorter than the average Harvard student (clocking in at 5 feet and one-and-three-quarters of an inch), but leaning back into the orange sphere was like retreating into a plush, Sunny D-colored cave. I had planned to finish some readings for a for class but the chair was so comfortable that I couldn’t. I lounged.
I looked at Massachusetts Avenue through the wall-sized window in front of me. I had a clear view from the T stop to the campus exit by Cafe Gato Rojo and all the way over to Clover. I thought I saw a professor I really admire drinking a grande Starbucks beverage, which I found remarkable because he seems too serious a person to have read the gratuitous Frappuccino flavors off the Starbucks menu. I looked again and realized it was a different, nicely dressed man rushing to campus. I wondered if I’d see my roommate running to class (he was still asleep by the time I left our room in the Quad, even though he had class in 30 minutes).
As I mindlessly watched people walk to and from campus, a friend texted me asking what I was up to. “Looking at Mass Ave,” I responded blandly as I surveyed people two stories below me, like a Greek god or a security camera incarnate.
After checking my texts and then, since I was already scrolling through my phone, checking Twitter and Instagram, I couldn’t stop thinking about my seminar from the day before, in which we talked about Facebook and Instagram data collection. Suddenly, I thought to myself, “Ohmygod, I’m watching people do mundane things without them knowing just like Facebook and Instagram watch me do virtual mundane things without me knowing. I am accidentally collecting people’s data!”
Shortly after, I left to attend class. But my thoughts strayed back to the Smith Center. Was my theory just a product of too much coffee? Or maybe my tabloid habit had rewired my brain to produce salacious headlines? I went back to the building the next day to find out. 
Though my intention was to investigate how the layout of the Smith Center compels people to essentially spy on other people, I totally forgot that people could see me from inside. When I arrived outside the Mass Ave entrance, engrossed in my phone, I paused outside to scroll through Twitter and stretch my mouth to see if my lips were chapped enough to crack. Then, I looked up at Smith. Though I could barely see through the mirrored reflection of the trees and the brick buildings across the street, I discerned the general outline of the people inside (who had a clear view of me grimacing maniacally at my phone). Then I remembered why I came: because I believed that anyone could watch random people do private and or revealing things on the street from inside Smith.
I walked inside and went to the second floor, to the side facing Holyoke Street. I sat in a chair the same color as the mini-cave, but this one was rectangular and permanently reclined at a 30 degree angle.
As I looked directly at Farkas Hall through a glass window the size of a movie screen, I felt like I was sitting on the inside of an iPhone. I don’t know what the inside of an iPhone looks like, but the Smith Center feels like what I imagine it would be. It’s very cold, presumably to ensure the things inside remain alert. It is eerily clean and has wide pathways so people, or electronic signals, can move quickly and freely around the space. There are lots of large metal things whose purpose remains opaque to me.
Obviously iPhones don’t have tiny people inside them pulling levers and carrying data to various parts of the phone. But, to be honest, I don’t know what the inside of an iPhone looks like or how Apple products even work. As far as I’m concerned, it is just tiny people carrying around tiny data —  maybe tiny wire baskets full of ones and zeros. And I felt like one of those tiny people as I watched a guy in a grey hoodie enter Farkas Hall. I collected his location data in my head without him knowing. I could, without even wanting to, see a guy wearing gym shorts (even though it was 60 degrees outside!) indulge in a cheese-and-egg Clover breakfast sandwich, like I was the Foursquare or Yelp app. I could see a guy in a plaid shirt run towards campus because he was, presumably, late to class. Like Facebook, I could try and sell him a Monster energy drink because I was, without his awareness, gleaning the most inane details of his routine.
Looking straight ahead in the Smith Center means watching people walk down Holyoke. But the layout of the building makes it seem natural, like it’s my default gaze. In fact, from two floors up, the street looks like it’s in Google Earth viewing mode. It’s the same way Mark Zuckerberg normalized Facebook data collection at his Senate hearing: “If you’re logged into Facebook and visit a website with the Like button, your browser sends us information about your visit.”
After 20 minutes, I had to leave Smith to go to class. Later that day, I walked past the building and didn’t think about whether I was being watched. It’s like when I’m on my phone — I never seem to remember that something or someone may be looking through my Google searches and Facebook chats.

My dad and I are about to go inside when he offers me his jacket.
“It’s going to be really cold in there,” he warns me. The jacket is emblazoned with the logo of the hospital where he works, and it’s about four sizes too large; my dad is six foot four. I feel diminutive.
Most of the staff are already milling about as they wait for the day to begin. The man at the machine in the corner checks his phone every now and then, and, at the front of the room, a woman is sitting at a desk taking notes on a spreadsheet. Sirius XM’s classic rock station is playing softly overhead. My dad was right about the cold; two of the women have rough cotton blankets wrapped around their waists. The man at the machine in the corner offers me a blanket, too. I politely decline and stuff my hands deeper into the pockets.
Conversation ebbs and flows around me: restaurant recommendations, tips for winning at the casinos down the road. For these people, it’s a normal day at work. A nurse is talking about her son’s basketball game as she hands my dad a scalpel, though he is silent when he makes the first incision in the patient’s chest.
My dad is a cardiothoracic surgeon. He performs one or two open-heart surgeries a day, but at times he’s completed more than 25 cases in a single week. So the only thing unusual about today is me. He’s invited me to watch him perform a double bypass on a man who I am told is in his sixties, whose face I cannot see. The man’s head is concealed under a dressing-draped metal cage, which the surgical team stacks tools on and occasionally uses as an armrest. The only visible parts of his body are concealed in brown iodine drape. I know nothing about him except for his name, written in messy dry-erase marker on a board next to the door.
As I watch the patient’s heart rate slow on the monitor, it strikes me that I am watching a major event in someone’s life. The scar on the patient’s chest will be permanent, and I am here to witness it form. My dad’s patients sometimes give him gifts as thank-you’s for putting their lives back together again. But he has received so many gifts over the years that he sometimes can’t remember when he got them, or who gave them to him in the first place. After all, he does this all the time.
Even though I’m a rare wild card in the world of his operating room, I’m no stranger to surgery. I grew up seeing photographs of hearts and lungs on the kitchen table. I watched a triple bypass a few days before I left home for my freshman year of college.
After the first time, I asked my dad if he told his patients that someone had watched their surgery. “It’d be weird knowing that some unqualified stranger has seen your internal organs,” I said.
“No, not really,” my dad replies with a shrug. “It doesn’t really matter if we tell them or not.”
The surgery goes on, and for a while I stand at the anesthesiologist’s station, right behind the patient’s head, watching the screen that keeps track of the various medicines the patient needs. The graphics look exactly like the ones on the computers at my waitressing job back home; the button here for “fentanyl” has the exact same size, shape and font as the button that, in my worksplace, stands for “chicken fried steak.”
My dad cuts through the patient’s sternum with a saw that sounds a lot like the electric turkey carver we use on Christmas and Easter. He warned me about how bad the operating room can smell — I’m mostly protected by the surgical mask I’m wearing, but I can smell the burning when they use a red-hot cauterizing knife to stop the bleeding.
During a double bypass, the heart must be empty of blood, which means the patient must stop breathing in the traditional way. To keep the patient alive, my dad hooks up a set of tubes to his major arteries and cycles the blood through a machine that the perfusionist — the person in charge of making sure the patient’s blood stays oxygenated — watches from a rolling chair. I notice the patient’s chest has stilled as Pat Benatar’s “Hit Me with Your Best Shot” begins to play.
My dad is the son of a carpenter. He grew up fixing things — the workshop in the backyard was his second schoolroom, and he’s passed some knowledge on to me. I’ve spent summers and weekends lying on our garage floor, holding car parts in place so he can fix them to his truck. He taught me to change tires and solder wires and fix a game camera to a tree.
He also taught me how to shoot a gun and a bow, how to clean fish and kill a snake. In elementary school, I spent early mornings frozen in camouflage and snake boots, waiting for turkeys to gather around the decoys or for deer to gather around the corn feeder. I became used to the feeling of a rifle butt in my shoulder, of a bow release pulling on my wrist. I would practice my aim with arrows and a foam archery block in the backyard, accompanying my dad to the gun range on his rare free Saturday.
It was just what we did. But even though I was supposed to, I never killed an animal, and I never liked the feeling of guns. He said it was because I wasn’t lucky, or that I wasn’t used to it. In reality, I lacked the heart.
All my life, I knew my dad as a surgeon. I knew he was a doctor, that his job was to fix people, that his calling was to make people better. He’s good at fixing people and the things around them; he can mend a malfunctioning heart or a malfunctioning car, rebuild someone’s venous system after a heart attack or rebuild a living room cabinet when the new TV doesn’t quite fit. His proficiency for fixing and saving always fit so naturally next to his proficiency for hunting and shooting that I didn’t question the juxtaposition until I was much older, when I realized that I had no interest in hunting or guns or medicine.
In the operating room, he’s used to being the center of all motion and attention. The nurses stand ready to hand him tools, the anesthesiologist and perfusionists wait for him to give them their cue. It isn’t until much later that I found out something went wrong during this surgery — the new vein wouldn’t seal to the heart. I didn’t notice because no one batted an eye.
A couple of times, I wonder how he remains so nonchalant about the whole process. But then again, I know he is nonchalant about life and death in a way that I am not. Medicine is his career — he earns his paycheck by cutting people open, fixing them, and then sewing them back together again.
I watch my dad’s hands as he begins to stitch. Hands that stitched together holes in stuffed animals after I cried for hours, awaiting his return home. Hands that cleaned shotguns at the kitchen table and poured black powder into bullet casings in the garage. Hands that can lace together or take apart. His choice.
The patient starts breathing again at exactly 12:30 p.m. to the soundtrack of “Sign of the Gypsy Queen” by April Wine. I try to force some feeling back into my cold toes.
My dad doesn’t stay for long after that. When the man’s chest is closed, his work is done. We walk back to the physicians’ lounge, eat some snacks, talk with a nurse from his team. I never see the patient’s face.

The cover of the magazine features a black-and-white photograph of a bare-chested masculine figure lying on a bed, the covers pulled up to just below the pecs. The face is cut off by the frame. The right arm splays across the striped duvet; the left reaches suggestively beneath the covers towards the groin.

The words “Lavender Portfolio” are printed — in lavender — along the border of the page.

Created under the auspices of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gay Students Association (GSA for short), the Lavender Portfolio meanders through student poems (“Death Camp in Lavender,” “Texas”), sketches (a strapping male, pictured from behind, is clad only in tight shorts), and photography (“Butch Posturing #2” juxtaposes a shirtless male student with photos of muscle-bound men in all their beefcake glory).


 How Lavender Portfolio came to be — whose idea it was, how it was published, how it was distributed — is mostly a mystery. Sandy F. Smith, Jr. ’82 and Jonathan L. Handel ’82, two members of the magazine’s six-person editorial staff, can recall only snatches of the beginning.

“I don’t remember now how we got around to discussing that we should put out a magazine,” Smith says. “But I know I expressed interest in that the moment the subject was broached.” Handel adds that he’s “pretty sure” magazine staff did not drop copies of the issue outside every undergraduate’s dorm-room door. “I think we left them on tables in the dining halls,” he says.

What is certain is that Lavender Portfolio was a one-off.

“It’s a shame that we never put out a second issue,” Smith says. “I think there were more stories we could have told.”


 The Portfolio’s lone issue was almost surely shocking to the average student enrolled at Harvard in 1982. It would probably be provocative even by today’s standards. But for queer students attending Harvard in the early 1980s through the late 1990s, magazine publication offered a way to own their sexuality — a means to carve out space for their own narratives. There were a handful of national gay-interest publications — most notably “The Advocate” and later “Out” — but gay issues and queer culture were mostly absent from mainstream media.

“I literally kept a clipping file of every gay-related story in the New York Times and the Boston Globe,” Handel says. “And it was easy to do, because there would be one such story every few months in either paper. There was no coverage.”
***
“DO NOT PURSUE GAPS.”

Someone has written this in inky black block letters on one of the first pages of Harvard’s archived collection of “Peninsula,” a conservative publication launched by Harvard students in 1990. A smaller hand has penciled in the name of one of these “gaps”— missing issues — below:
vol. 3, no. 2
“Exploring the Truth”
Re: Homosexuality
Visitors can page through an anti-abortion issue of Peninsula (Nov. 1992, title-less and displaying on its cover a cartoon fetus with the hook of a wire hanger wrapped around its head). Passersby can also pick up an edition devoted to the environment (May 1993, “Saving the Earth from the Environmentalists”). But “Exploring the Truth Re: Homosexuality”?

Nowhere to be found.

I didn’t listen. I pursued the gap, and it brought me to the Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana — where Rev. Roger J. Landry ’92, one of the founders of Peninsula, had sent it in March 1992, and where staff librarians were kind enough to send me scanned copies of the magazine.

In an enclosed letter, Landry writes to a Mr. James Lanning: “I apologize that it has taken so long for me to send you the issue. We have been so swamped with requests for this issue that we ran out of issues in the middle of February. Over the past month, I first had to find money to reprint the issue, and then had to re-edit it and get it to the printers. I’m proud to say that the issue I’ve sent you is the new-and-improved edition.”

The fruits of Landry’s labors are now captured in a convenient PDF and pulled up on the screen of my laptop.


 On the cover, a pink triangle explodes into shards — it looks as though a bullet has blown through, sending rose-colored fragments flying towards the reader. At the bottom is printed — as is printed on each and every edition of Peninsula — “All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

As if any clarification were necessary, the magazine’s self-styled “Preamble” renders the intention of its Oct./Nov. 1991 issue abundantly clear: “Why we think homosexuality is bad, and what we would do about it, is what this issue is all about.”

For Landry, that edition of Peninsula concretized a view that was “not being considered” within the undergraduate community at Harvard. He calls this perspective “street-corner conservatism” — which he defines as “the type of conservatism you’d hear at a barbershop.”

Sean P. McLaughlin ’91, who founded Peninsula alongside Landry, initially wrote for a conservative publication called “The Harvard Salient” and established in 1981. McLaughlin says not all perspectives were welcome in that community: “A kid came in and tried to submit an article about a moral conservative issue, as opposed to an economic issue, and it was rejected. And at that point this had happened a couple of times.” These “moral conservative issues” included abortion, the access to birth control — and homosexuality.
José M. Padilla ’97 saw Peninsula’s willingness to adopt controversial stances as a way to let dissidence surface on campus. “The point of it was: let’s say something that’s really outrageous in order to create space.”


 Landry, now a priest of the Diocese of Fall River, Mass., said the “Homosexuality” issue was inspired by the activities of queer students on campus.

“That was an issue that basically was born from my experiences as a freshman at the Freshman Outdoor Program trip. I met a handful of classmates and, you know, nice guys, they were all Americans — and then five or six months later, they had identified as gay.”

Landry’s description of the impetus behind the issue is one of collective interest. These classmates, he says, were “getting more and more involved in a lifestyle that we didn’t think was really for their happiness.”
***
Peninsula door-dropped its “Homosexuality” issue to every undergraduate on campus.

Rachel E. Cohen ’94 vividly remembers the day the magazine came out in print. “I remember waking up one morning as a sophomore in Lowell House and finding that there was a copy of Peninsula on our doormat, and an exploding pink triangle on the cover of it,” she says.

“We were outraged, we were appalled, we were shocked,” Joel L. Derfner ’95 says. “Well, we weren’t shocked. Because there were people like that all around back then.”

Though Rachel B. Tiven ’96 was not on campus during the release of the “Homosexuality” issue — she enrolled as a first-year the following fall — she was well aware of the publication. She says Harvard sent it to her as a part of her admissions materials as an incoming member of the class of 1996.

“It was mailed to us in a packet of examples of student publications,” Tiven says with a laugh. It’s a sunny late afternoon, and we’re sitting on the steps of Memorial Church in Harvard Yard. “I don’t remember being upset exactly. I remember being like, what the fuck is this?”

Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73, who has worked as director of admissions since the 1980s, wrote in an email that Harvard often sent a sampling of publications and printed materials to admitted students around that time.

“It was a pretty random selection as I recall — we wanted to introduce prospective students to the dazzling array of publications at Harvard, and we wanted them to get a sense of the diversity of activities and opinions. I don’t recall specifically what we sent — it varied from year to year and there may even have been some variation within a given mailing, depending on how many copies of each we could get,” McGrath wrote. “I don’t remember anything about Peninsula specifically.”

But Theodore A. Gideonse ’96 does. He says the magazine with the pink triangle on its cover turned up in his mail, too. “As someone who knew they were going to come out the minute they got to school, seeing that was pretty unnerving,” he says.

The staff of Peninsula spent 19 months researching the issue, Landry says. The first part is titled “Exposing the Myths”; the second, “Exploring the Truth”; and the third, “Evaluating Solutions.” The edition includes a flow chart Landry compiled titled “Possible Pathways to a Homosexual Orientation.” In addition to biology, he lists “difficulty getting role models,” “experimentation and enjoyment,” “trauma,” and “desperate election.”

One of the last articles in the issue — “The Courage to Change: A Survey of Help Groups for Homosexuals” — provides contact information for six such groups. A note below this array of foundations and rectories reads: “Unfortunately, however, Harvard University has no campus organizations or services dedicated to helping homosexuals who wish to change their lifestyle. In fact, neither University Health Services nor any of Harvard’s half-dozen or so pro-homosexuality organizations even offer information about the alternatives available to homosexual students. Perhaps it’s time that the university did.”

For queer students and allies on campus, the “Homosexuality” issue served as a rallying cry.

“When I say it was galvanizing, I mean that the lesbigay community” — a title Derfner says some in Harvard’s queer community adopted at the time — “had been very close, and we hung out, because we were the only people like us we knew.”

“And now we had an enemy.”
***
Two days after the “Homosexuality” issue dropped, the BGLSA (the ‘B’ was added in the late 80’s) organized an emergency night-time meeting. Nearly 100 students attended the gathering, at which they planned two dining hall sit-ins. They also organized and held a rally at noon the next day, Sheila A. Avelin ’93 remembers.

But that wasn’t nearly enough.

“Any undergraduate who had any connection to any closeted professor was deputized to reach out to that professor,” Avelin says. A junior at the time, Avelin had served as co-president of the BGLSA the year before.

“People were in glass closets. The message of that to undergraduates was, ‘This is how you get along.’ You can acknowledge it privately to your friends, but it’s not something you can speak to in your professional world.”

Avelin reached out to Barbara E. Johnson, a professor of law and psychiatry in society. “I looked her up in the white pages, and so I called her at home and asked her if she would speak at this rally. And she agreed to.”

With Johnson in their camp, the rally organizers were able to convince another faculty member to come out that day: Reverend Peter J. Gomes, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church of Harvard University.

“It was after Barbara had said that she would that we got Peter Gomes to speak,” Avelin says. Johnson ended up speaking after Gomes, “but Barbara also came out that day and opened up space for us to tell Peter that he would not be the only faculty member coming out.”

The rally began at noon. Energy was high. When the time came for Gomes to speak, the reverend — whom Derfner remembers as the kind of public speaker who could “work a crowd like nobody’s business” — cracked joke after joke.

“And then he came out,” Derfner says.

Gomes’s declaration was simple: “I am a Christian who happens to be gay.”

The crowd of around 250 went wild. In its next issue, Peninsula published a complete transcription of Gomes’ speech. Just after faithfully copying down Gomes’s nine-word revelation, the transcriber wrote into the text: “[Wild applause and cheering for 27 seconds]”.

The minister’s public — and unexpected — avowal of his sexuality marked a milestone for many of the College’s queer students.

“The person who was the closest to God on campus had staked this moral claim that outness was the morally correct stance, and it turned things inside out,” Avelin says.

Still, Gomes’s “moral claim” did not go undisputed. Two campus groups — Concerned Christians at Harvard and Association Against Learning in the Absence of Religion and Morality (AALARM) — actively campaigned for his resignation in the wake of the rally.

Less than a decade after Lavender Portfolio, queer students at Harvard once again began seeking a place in print where their voices could be heard.
***
We dedicate this first issue of HQ to the
Reverend Peter J. Gomes,
for his courage.
 These words grace the inner front cover of “HQ,” a publication begun in 1992 as a response to the “Homosexuality” issue and the events that followed. The cover itself is black and white, bearing a target with a sinuous, bold black line that reaches out from the central rings. A row of block-shaped recesses line the top, each holding what looks like a fragment of sculpture. Nose and lips are visible in one; an ear in another. The only thing discernible in this dense and inscrutable system of symbology is the “H” scrawled in black in the top left corner.

William T. “Tate” Dougherty ’94, who helped design the cover, says he drew on the work of 20th-century gay artist Jasper Johns. The image of the target represented “how all of us felt,” he says.


 Dougherty and Cohen and a third founder, Timothy M. “Cage” Hall ’94, wanted HQ’s name to reflect its inclusive bent — and to differentiate it from the dogmatic moral binary preached by Peninsula. “We all liked HQ. It seemed to suggest Harvard Queer, but not demand it,” Cohen says.

Much like Lavender Portfolio, HQ featured poetry, art, and essays; it was very much a literary magazine. It did not grapple with explicitly political discourse.

It was important to Cohen that every issue be door-dropped. “I wanted it on every doorstep in the same way Peninsula had been on every doorstep,” she says. She organized and sent battalions of volunteers to deliver cases of each issue to every House. She joined in the action, too, running up and down scores of sets of stairs.

Cohen, Dougherty, and Hall later recruited Tiven and Gideonse to help produce the publication.

“I can’t remember how I ended up going to a meeting of HQ, where I met Cage and Tate and Rachel,” Gideonse says. He does, however, remember when he saw HQ for the first time.

He spotted the second issue, whose cover featured an image of Bill Clinton and Al Gore photoshopped to resemble bodybuilders straight out of a gay fantasia. “I remember that showing up in the basket in front of my door in Hurlbut and being like, ‘Oh my God, this is the most amazing thing in the world.’”

The mass distribution of HQ — and of Peninsula — was possible because of what Hall calls “the home computing and home publishing revolution.” It was easy to obtain and use software like Pagemaker to run off a couple hundred issues at a cost of only a few hundred dollars. This led to a proliferation of undergraduate publications at Harvard. In 1982, at the time Lavender Portfolio was published, there were 15 student organizations listed in the Unofficial Guide to Life at Harvard under “Communications.” By 1993, that number had grown to 39.

In all, there were five issues of HQ. The final issue, which explored the intersection of race and sexuality, was published in April 1994. The magazine died soon after, lacking “a combination of interest and money,” Gideonse says. Cohen, Dougherty, and Hall graduated that year, and Gideonse and Tiven got tied up in other campus responsibilities — he became an editor of Fifteen Minutes, and she upped her level of involvement at Hillel, where she founded the queer affinity group BAGELS.

After two years, HQ departed Harvard’s dining halls and — like Lavender Portfolio before it — began a half-life of existence in the University’s archives.
***
As publications made by queer students and intended for a broad audience, Lavender Portfolio and HQ were several years ahead of their time. By the end of the 1990s, though, queer voices had entered the mainstream. Television shows like Will & Grace paved the way for positive, sympathetic representation of gay characters in popular culture.

In 1997, Ellen DeGeneres famously came out on the cover of Time Magazine. Less than a year later, Andrew P. Tobias ’68 came out on the cover of Harvard Magazine.

In 1973, Tobias — under the pseudonym John Reid — had written a book titled “The Best Little Boy in the World.” Billed on Amazon as “the classic account of growing up gay in America,” the book details the pressures gay men face in the mid-20th century closet as filtered through Tobias’ own experiences. Over two decades years later in 1998, Tobias republished “The Best Little Boy in the World” under his real name. He also released its sequel, “The Best Little Boy in the World Grows Up.” And in 1998, he chose to come out to the entire Harvard community.

Craig Lambert, who was Associate Editor of Harvard Magazine at the time, recalls approaching Tobias to solicit the piece. According to Lambert, there was no particular “trigger moment.”

“It was just an important issue and had a connection to Harvard,” Lambert says. “It was something that was in the air, had been in the air for years, and I thought, ‘We oughta treat it.’”

Lambert and the editorial staff knew there was potential for controversy. The magazine, described online as a “separately incorporated nonprofit affiliate of Harvard University,” goes out — for free — to all staff, faculty, and alumni of the University. Harvard affiliates have to actively opt out to stop receiving the magazine.

The size of the guaranteed thousands-strong audience didn’t deter Lambert. “We knew this was an appropriate story, a good story, a story that needed to be told.”

To Tobias, the editors at Harvard Magazine were the “brave ones.”

“I was already out. It was easy and fun for me to do, but I couldn’t lose my job over it or lose a lot of subscriptions,” Tobias says. The article, titled “Gay Like Me,” is a meditation on what it took to grapple with homosexuaity in the 1960s at Harvard. Tobias tells his own story, as well as those of a number of gay classmates, who navigated a Harvard where some students pursued electric shock therapy out of the mistaken notion it might cure their homosexuality.

In the piece, Tobias didn’t hold back. “Some of us kill ourselves, but others (really most, I think) make it through just fine,” he wrote.

The pushback was significant, and alumni put pen to paper to voice a wide range of responses. “It is, I think, the greatest and largest number of, I think, at least published letters that we ever had into any story in the magazine’s history, that I know of,” Lambert says.

In its next issue, the editorial staff of Harvard Magazine printed 21 of the letters received. “To put it mildly, I am appalled, shocked, disgusted, and saddened that your magazine would attempt to depict homosexuality as a normal and acceptable lifestyle… Don’t you have any consideration for Harvard’s historic reputation? I urge you to stop printing such trash,” reads one letter, sent in by a Samuel T. Rhodes.

Lambert says the first wave of letters were mostly hostile. But after readers read those letters, the magazine drew another wave of missives — these “overwhelmingly” positive. Harvard Magazine printed 20 letters in its next issue, and five more in the issue after that.

“I’m still seeing red,” Ellen F. Zaslaw ’63 wrote in the May-June issue. “Tobias’s article didn’t shock me. What shocked me — and stirred in me feelings of unreality that this could be happening in a Harvard environment — was the hostile mail that arrived in response.” The letter concluded: “These are people whose Harvard education has failed them.”

Tobias identified a generational gap. The more disapproving alumni tended to skew older, Tobias says. And “basically anybody under 40 was saying ‘hurray, good for Harvard Magazine for doing this, and hats off to you,’ and all that.”
***
From national publications like The Advocate and Out all the way to Harvard Magazine, the printed word holds an influential space in the history of queer agitation in the eighties and nineties.

There’s just something about writing it down.

Michael Amico is an alumnus of Dartmouth College and served as editor-in-chief of an intercollegiate queer student publication, called “queer.”, that began at Harvard in the early 2000s.

“Most of my life, I guess, has been trying to find a language to talk about sexual desire in a more complex, nuanced, accurate way, not just with my fellow students — with everyone, my family, with people I meet on the street, with people I hook up with,” Amico says. “With everyone.”

A historian currently at work on a book about gay love stories in the American Civil War, Amico thinks a lot about the expression of desire via the written word. “Sexual desire is premised on not saying and not telling, not because it’s titillating or not because we’re repressed, but because the whole point of sexuality is that the center of it is unknown.”

“But nonetheless, that just means there can be more artful ways to talk about sex.”


Lavender Portfolio and HQ form some of these “artful ways”: physical manifestations of what are, to many, frustrating intangibilities.

When Ted Gideonse and Rachel Tiven arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1992, no one in their class had come out. Both Gideonse and Tiven broke ground by coming out that fall. “By the end of freshman year, besides us, we only knew of nine or ten out students who were freshmen. That is really isolating,” Gideonse says, his voice quiet.

Today’s Harvard is a very different place. In my upperclassmen house, there’s a rainbow flag hanging in the dining hall; signs expressing solidarity — including one reading “Pfoho Tutors Support Our LGBTQ Students” — hang pinned to the doors of House staff.

Asked about the influence of HQ on Harvard’s campus, Dougherty chuckles. “It’s more like hypothetical influence.”

“None of us will ever say it changed the world, but all of us would say that we know it was important, even if we still couldn’t quantify it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has placed the head coach of its diving program Chris Heaton on leave after a class-action suit filed in an Indiana court alleged that the 31-year-old solicited nude pictures from and sent photos of his penis to young female swimmers years ago.
Heaton — who is named in the suit, but not as a defendant — allegedly committed the acts of sexual misconduct when he was teaching at the Indiana Diving Academy known as Ripfest, according to the suit. Athletes began complaining about Heaton’s behavior to his superiors in 2015, the suit says.
Harvard did not know about the allegations against Heaton when it hired him two months ago, according to University spokesperson Rachael Dane.
“Harvard University was unaware of any allegations of sexual misconduct when Mr. Heaton was hired as the Head Coach for Diving in August 2018,” Dane wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday. “Upon learning of these allegations from media reports, Harvard immediately placed Mr. Heaton on leave, pending a review of these allegations by Harvard University.”
Heaton could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. CNN first reported that Harvard had placed the coach on leave.
The lawsuit, filed Sept. 30 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, details both Heaton’s alleged misbehavior and students’ frequent — but unsuccessful — attempts to alert Ripfest president John Wingfield to Heaton’s conduct.
“On numerous occasions… Chris Heaton solicited nude pictures from female athletes at Ripfest,” the suit states. “Heaton sent pictures of his penis to young female athletes.”
Wingfield, however, was “dismissive” of the female athletes’ complaints about Heaton, according to the suit. Wingfield could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.
Instead, Chris Zukas, another Ripfest coach, stepped in, according to the suit. Zukas “was instrumental in getting Heaton to leave Ripfest,” the suit states.
Harvard hired Heaton in August 2018. At the time, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise praised the new coach in a press release.
“Chris is an outstanding coach and educator,” Scalise said at the time. “He brings a great track record of helping students achieve success at the highest level.”
Heaton said in the release that he was thrilled to accept the position as head diving coach. Mentioning his wife and three daughters, he said he was eager to start work.
“My wife, three daughters, and I are excited to relocate to Cambridge,” Heaton said. “I look forward to bringing my knowledge, experience, and passion to the team and partnering with the coaching staff to continue to foster an environment that creates successful scholars, athletes, and leaders.”
Heaton is not the only Harvard Athletics employee to face allegations of sexual misbehavior in the past year. Former Harvard track coach Walter W. Johnson ’71 was arrested and charged with the possession and distribution of child pornography in April 2017. He had served as a track coach for the University’s men’s and women’s teams from 1982 to 2006.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams plans to use the added cash raised through the school's capital campaign to bolster financial aid programs, renovate old campus buildings, and erect new ones, she said in an interview Wednesday.
The school announced its capital campaign fundraising total of $933 million two weeks ago. Williams said she wants to invest some of the school’s newfound riches in major infrastructure projects that will help consolidate and update its campus.
“A major priority emerging after the successful campaign has to be a campaign to help us rebuild our campus,” she said.
Williams pointed to two aspects of the school’s current campus that she finds troublesome. First, the school’s offices and classrooms are dispersed across 25 different physical addresses. The school’s main campus is on Huntington Ave., near the Medical School, but it also has offices at the Landmark Center in Boston, about a mile away, and in Harvard Square, about three miles away.
“It's really hard to exercise this team science if the overhead of our getting together to be a team is so high,” Williams said.
Second, she noted some of the school’s buildings are approaching the end of their “built utility.” She pointed to the Kresge Building, completed in 1975, as one example.
“We are investing quite a lot in repairing and rehabbing space that we would rather use those resources to build a facility that is more in keeping with the 21st-century science that our faculty and students are doing,” Williams said.
Looking forward, Williams said she has discussed plans for infrastructure redevelopment with top Harvard administrators. Further construction or renovations would need to be “done in coordination with the master plan of the University” over the course of several years, she said.
In recent years, Harvard’s Cambridge campus has seen several large-scale construction or renovation projects — including the more-than-$1-billion House Renewal projects currently underway. Construction, however, has been less extensive across the river in Longwood.
Williams said another fiscal priority for the school is to help reduce the debt load that students must assume to graduate.
“Right now the average debt that students leave with is $75,000,” she said. “I'd like to see that drop to zero if we can make that happen through pushing on philanthropic sources.”
A debt-free guarantee would require the school to spend roughly $40 million on financial aid each year, according to Williams.
The school’s capital campaign raised about $26 million specifically earmarked for financial aid, administrators announced at the campaign celebration last month.
Full-time tuition without financial aid for the school’s most popular degree program, the Master of Public Health, currently clocks in at $58,635 per year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After their old contract expired — and with no new agreement immediately in sight — leaders of Harvard’s largest union hosted events across campus this week to garner support for continued negotiations with the University.
At tables set up in the cafes and in the main thoroughfares of campus buildings across nine of Harvard’s schools, representatives from the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers encouraged members to sign a statement of support and to read up on the plan for negotiations going forward. Members were allowed to take "HUCTW" buttons and were encouraged to hang posters in their workspaces bearing slogans such as “INVEST IN STAFF” and “WE CAN’T EAT PRESTIGE.”
The last time the University and HUCTW negotiated a contract in 2015, bargaining continued for nearly four months after the expiration of the union’s previous contract. The 2015 contract, which was binding for three years, expired Sunday night.
The University and the union have agreed to keep members’ benefits in place in the absence of a contract, as they did during previous negotiations that stretched past deadline. But the lack of a resolution will delay any expected raises that a new contract might bring for union members.
The University and the union remain at odds over three central issues: wages, healthcare, and the use of contingent workers such as "temps." HUCTW President Carrie Barbash said many union members who stopped by HUCTW tables this week feel that continued negotiations over these issues are “in line with their priorities.”
“We’ve had really positive response from members,” Barbash said. “All the members who’ve been coming by the tables are very supportive, and seem to think we’re all on the same page.”
Barbash said the events around campus are meant to demonstrate that union leadership and negotiators “have the membership’s backing” in continuing to bargain with the University.
“We want to get as many people up to speed on what’s happening as possible,” Barbash said.
Union member Geoffrey Carens wrote in an email that he believes union members are in danger of being “nickel-and-dimed” in negotiations this year.
“Personally I'm very disappointed that the University hasn't been willing to make a deal with the union leadership, especially considering how modest HUCTW's goals are,” Carens wrote. “Union members were asking, ‘Where's our raise?’”
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement Monday night that Harvard is "committed" to "continued negotiations that resolve all outstanding issues."
"The University is as eager as HUCTW to reach a resolution and has put forward fair proposals that ensure HUCTW members salary and range of benefits remain top of market," Jackson wrote. "We keenly understand the critical nature of the work members of the HUCTW perform for the Harvard community, and we are proud that they receive compensation and benefits packages that lead among Boston-area higher education institutions."
The daily tabling events, which began on Monday, will continue through Thursday afternoon. Though union leaders have not yet planned any “next steps,” Barbash said they are preparing for many possible scenarios.
“We could come to a resolution, and that’s what I think everybody hopes for, but it’s possible that we might not be able to do that right away,” she said.
“If we do need to go on for longer, it’s definitely the case that we’ll be asking for members to get more involved,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College administrators are “in dialogue” with some of the few single-gender social groups left on campus about the possibility of going gender-neutral and thus avoiding Harvard's sanctions, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview last Thursday.
Fourteen formerly single-gender groups — including every all-female group on campus — have already vowed to go co-ed in exchange for College recognition and exemptions from the social group penalties. Their shift toward gender-neutral status left behind just a handful of single-gender groups in Cambridge.The hold-outs include three fraternities — Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Chi — and six final clubs: the Owl, the Porcellian Club, the A.D. Club, the Fly Club, the Phoenix S.K. Club, and the Fox Club.
Representatives for six of the nine remaining all-male groups did not respond to requests for comment on whether they have been in contact with the College. Bartle B. Bull ’93, graduate president of the A.D., declined to comment.
Fly graduate president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 also said the College has not been in communication with his club's leadership.
"Neither Dean Khurana nor anyone number of his staff have communicated the terms of recognition with the Fly Club board of directors," Porteus said.
In an emailed statement, Adam M. Kahn, the self-identified "undergraduate president" of Harvard’s chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, said the fraternity does not plan to admit women.
“We haven’t been in contact or received any form communication from Dean Khurana,” Kahn wrote in the email. “At this time we do not plan on complying with Harvard sanctions and will continue as a single gender organization but we are not opposed to having an open dialogue with Dean Khurana moving forward.”
The College’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
Khurana declined to specify the number or identity of the single-sex groups now talking to administrators. He said conversations between social groups and the College have centered around how organizations can “modify or change and come into conformance with our university’s policies.”
To receive College recognition, groups must not only be gender-neutral but cannot remain affiliated with graduate boards that the College determines exert too much sway over the organizations. Groups that affirm they do not discriminate on the basis of a wide a variety of criteria including race and sexual orientation may progress to higher levels of recognition that confer perks including College cash.
While some groups have gone co-ed to avoid the sanctions, a few still hope to imperil the College’s policy. Members of the Cambridge Coalition — a group comprising the P.C., the A.D., the Fly, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Chi — have traveled to Washington, D.C. in recent months to lobby for a bill that could force Harvard to choose between millions of dollars in federal research funding and its controversial social group policy.
If they fail in their mission on the Hill, Cambridge Coalition members have said they may sue Harvard.
Khurana did not directly respond to a question last week asking how worried he is about a lawsuit. He said no one at Harvard has asked him to start preparing for the possibility that some single-gender groups sue.
Instead, he said he thinks the majority of single-gender organizations hope to eventually become gender-neutral.
“Personally, I believe that most of these organizations are trying to find a way to become inclusive and evolve,” he said. “It’s just not always easy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shopping week may one day be a virtual experience.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke detailed what a replacement for the current course registration system could look like at a Graduate Student Council town hall Wednesday evening, suggesting the College is seriously exploring a shift to early registration. Such a switch would cancel shopping week, the traditional course registration process that allows Harvard students to freely walk in and out of classes to sample them during the first week of the semester before making final selections.
Burke said an early registration system might include a “digital” shopping period during which students could watch online materials to preview courses. He said tools like Canvas and the “Q” Guide, an online system that aggregates student feedback on Harvard courses and instructors, lessen the need for shopping week.
At the request of the Faculty Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body — Burke is currently forming a panel to propose a new system by which students can select courses. The possibility of a new registration setup first surfaced at a March Faculty meeting when Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana broached the subject, though he did not offer any kind of formal proposal at the time. Many professors spoke in favor of the idea.
Given the number of students taking any particular course remains in flux until the end of the week and given teaching fellows are typically alloted based on class size, the current structure of shopping week means professors are sometimes forced to hire or dismiss teaching fellows on very short notice. Graduate students have long complained of shopping week-induced headaches, lamenting the fact that their teaching positions remain in limbo while undergraduates finalize their schedules.
Many undergraduate students, however, have praised shopping week for its flexibility. Some say they appreciate the chance to try out classes before formally enrolling.
The Council heard a proposal to switch to early registration from Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh at its last meeting on Sept. 12. The proposal advocated replacing shopping week with a system that would require students to enroll in courses before the beginning of the semester. Students would then have time to add or drop courses if they wished.Burke added that graduate teaching fellows would likely benefit from such change. He said the current system “creates havoc and has a real life impact for grad students.”
After hearing Burke’s proposal, several attendees said they would favor a move to early registration. GSC representative DeAnza A. Cook said that, while undergraduates may moan over the loss of shopping week, the proposed change would ultimately “enhance the undergraduate educational experience.”
“Teaching fellows would be better prepared to actually teach the classes and work collaboratively with faculty earlier than what shopping week allows,” she said.
Michael Ortiz, a first-year graduate student who also sits on the GSC, said he hopes the Faculty Council will prioritize the needs of graduate students in their deliberations.
“On the practical side, my sympathies lie with the teaching fellows and the difficulties that occur when you don’t have a final roster for classes,” he said. “I’m hoping that the administration will keep them in mind.”
Burke said his panel will likely present a proposal to the Faculty Council in January. He added that — if the faculty ultimately approve an early registration proposal — it will roll out two years from now at the earliest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council published an open letter Wednesday asserting it supports the federal investigation into Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and urging the University to undertake its own probe into sexual misconduct allegations brought against the embattled Supreme Court nominee and former Harvard Law lecturer.
Harvard Law School administrators have repeatedly refused to say whether the school is investigating or plans to investigate Kavanaugh. The FBI on Wednesday concluded a roughly week-long probe into allegations of sexual misconduct brought against the nominee by at least three women, according to the Washington Post. The Council, which comprises representatives from each of Harvard’s 12 graduate schools, voted to release the statement — posted on Facebook — at a meeting Tuesday evening.
"The Harvard Graduate Council (HCG) is deeply moved by the accounts of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick," the letter reads. "The Harvard Graduate Council demands that the Congress of the United States withold its vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court until a thorough and independent investigation has been completed into the allegations of sexual assault levied against him."
The Senate will review the contents of the FBI report in coming days and Republicans hope to hold a final vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation by the end of the week, according to the Post.
The Council's letter comes days after The Crimson reported Kavanaugh would not return to teach a January course at Harvard Law School following weeks of student outcry over his continued employment at the school. Both he and University President Lawrence S. Bacow have indicated he made the decision to leave on his own.
President Donald Trump nominated the conservative judge to the Supreme Court in July. His ascension to the nation's highest court seemed all but certain until the first woman spoke up in mid-September.
Ford granted the Washington Post a tell-all interview roughly two weeks ago, telling the newspaper that Kavanaugh had tried to rape her at a house party the two attended in suburban Maryland in the 1980s. Days later, Ramirez told the New Yorker Kavanaugh had pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while they were undergraduates at Yale. And last Wednesday, Swetnick said in a sworn affidavit that Kavanaugh was present while a group of teenage boys drugged and raped her at a D.C.-area party in 1982.
At Harvard, where Kavanaugh has taught since 2008, the allegations prompted students at the Law School to protest Kavanaugh’s confirmation and to demand Harvard launch its own probe into the allegations against the nominee. HGC members wrote in Wednesday's letter that they agree with those who have demanded Harvard investigate Kavanaugh, arguing that every allegation against a faculty member should lead in an internal investigation.
“HGC celebrates the activism of students who have demanded that the Harvard administration initiate a separate investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh in lieu of his scheduled January lecture at the Harvard Law School,” the letter reads. “No professor who is accused of a serious crime like sexual assault should be allowed to continue teaching without an investigation into the allegations.”
"The administration must consistently uphold this standard of scrutiny and accountablity in all instances of sexual assault across the university," the letter continues.
The council’s letter is meant to represent the views of Harvard’s graduate student community at large. Harvard Graduate Council president Max Vani wrote in an email that “the Council decided that high-profile matters surrounding sexual assault are of university-wide importance and should be addressed collectively by all of Harvard's constituent schools.”
The effort forms part of a larger push by the group to speak out about national and local issues affecting graduate students. At the same meeting, the council discussed the possibility of forming an External Affairs subcommittee specifically charged with releasing these kinds of statements.

The Harvard Kennedy School has adopted new guidelines for vetting fellows following a year in which its decision to appoint Chelsea Manning and several Trump administration officials to fellowships generated campus and national backlash, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in an interview Tuesday.
The new protocols will take into account a candidate’s “values” and his or her potential for engaging with the school, among other considerations. If a candidate proves particularly divisive among HKS affiliates, the dean pledged to convene a committee to review the candidate.
Elmendorf said he spent last spring “talking with people around the school” about the roles of fellows — conversations which resulted in a new set of guidelines meant to regulate the fellow selection process at different research centers. Though faculty are still reviewing the guidelines before they decide whether to formally approve the new rules, Elmendorf said the school has already begun to follow the guidelines “as an ongoing practical matter.”
The changes come almost exactly a year after the school released a statement in Oct. 2017 saying administrators were “working to better understand our current practices for applying the term 'Fellow,' and to establish consistent standards across the School.” That statement came in response to criticism the school received for extending a fellowship invitation — and then rescinding that invitation — to Manning, a former U.S. army soldier and transgender rights advocate who was convicted of leaking several thousand classified documents to WikiLeaks.
After HKS named Manning a fellow, Kennedy School senior fellow and former CIA deputy director Michael J. Morrell resigned from his post and CIA Director Mike Pompeo backed out of an event at the school’s Institute of Politics to protest the decision. Early the next day, Elmendorf rescinded Manning’s appointment and called her selection “a mistake” — sparking several campus organizations to release a letter in support of Manning. More than 15,000 people also signed a petition created by Harvard graduates condemning the school’s decision to disinvite Manning.
The Manning controversy was one of several the school confronted during fall 2017. More than 2,000 alumni at one point signed a petition to revoke the fellowships of former White House press Sean Spicer and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, arguing that the former Trump officials damaged public discourse and promoted “white nationalism.” Spicer also garnered criticism after visiting Harvard several times without holding any on-the-record events.
The imbroglios prompted the school to reflect on the ways in which it chooses fellows — and what, exactly, the term “fellow” means.
The school has a variety of fellowships associated with its 11 research centers, which include the IOP, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. These centers offer a wide range of fellowship experiences; some encourage teaching or engaging with undergraduates, some are geared toward research, some are tailored toward post-doctoral fellows, and others bring in political bigwigs.
“Part of the difficulty of overseeing the fellows at the Kennedy School is that they come in so many different varieties and play different roles in our educational mission,” Elmendorf said.
As part of the new guidelines, he said, fellows who come to the Kennedy School should expect “sustained engagement with real faculty oversight.”
“If you're coming just to give a talk or a couple talks in a day, then you should not be a fellow at the Kennedy School,” he added. “You should come and we will listen to you, but you wouldn't be a fellow.”
Elmendorf also said school administrators charged with evaluating candidates should assess whether they model the “values” of the Kennedy School.
“If they will be here long enough, and that we think for other reasons because of expertise they should have the title of fellow, then we will also consider whether they have behaved in ways that seem consistent with our values,” he said.
The dean was referring to the values of public leadership he outlined in a speech to students in 2017, according to Kennedy School spokesperson Gail M. Chalef. They include the “importance of truth and knowledge,” “civil discourse and compromise,” and “focusing attention on those who have been disadvantaged.”
The other values Elmendorf emphasized in the speech were “the worth of each person” regardless of characteristics like race, gender, and sexual orientation — as well as the creation of governments and institutions that “act effectively in the public interest.”
In a recent interview, Elmendorf said that, in cases where there may be disagreement over whether it is “appropriate” for someone to be a fellow, he will convene a committee of faculty members to review the applicant’s proposal.
The school is also working to increase the diversity of fellows “along demographic lines, along ideological lines, and in other ways,” he said.
The Kennedy School has faced scrutiny in recent years for its lack of racial and gender diversity among students, faculty and staff. Diversifying the pool of fellows is easier and quicker than shifting the demographics of other groups at the school, since fellows turn over each year, Elmendorf said.
Daniel B. Harsha, a spokesperson for the Kennedy School’s Ash Center, said fellows add a “richness and diversity” to the center.
“We have long committed to engage emerging scholars with great promise as well as the very best leaders in their fields, be they academics or practitioners, to inform our faculty’s research, teaching, and impact on practice,” Harsha said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article was updated on Oct. 4, 2018 at 8:15 p.m.
Forty Harvard Law School professors have signed a New York Times editorial arguing that the United States Senate should not confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
Harvard affiliates — including former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and Laurence Tribe — joined more than 2,400 law professors across the country in signing the editorial, published online Wednesday. The professors wrote that Kavanaugh displayed a lack of “impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land” in the heated testimony he gave during a nationally televised hearing held Sept. 27 in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Judge Kavanaugh exhibited a lack of commitment to judicious inquiry,” the letter read. “Instead of being open to the necessary search for accuracy, Judge Kavanaugh was repeatedly aggressive with questioners.”
As of Thursday evening, 40 Harvard Law professors had signed the article, which authors indicated "will be updated as more signatures are received." The signatories presented their letter to the United States Senate on Oct. 4.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate committee to address allegations of sexual misconduct raised by Palo Alto psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the Supreme Court nominee of attempting to rape her at a house party in 1982 in suburban Maryland. Ford recounted these allegations in detail to the Judiciary Committee last Thursday before Kavanaugh himself testified.
After Ford went public with her allegations, two more women — Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick — came forward with their own charges. Ramirez said Kavanaugh shoved his penis in her face at a party during their freshman year at Yale College and Swetnick issued a statement in which she said she saw Kavanaugh engage in “inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s.”
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied these allegations. During last Thursday’s hearing, he vehemently and angrily insisted that the women’s tales of sexual misconduct formed part of a partisan plot by the Democrats to ruin his nomination.
The professors did not take a stance on the allegations against Kavanaugh, focusing instead on the judge's temperament and writing that “we have differing views about the other qualifications of Judge Kavanaugh.”
The Crimson reported Monday evening that Kavanaugh will not return to teach at the Law School this winter; he was originally slated to teach a class titled “The Supreme Court Since 2005” for three weeks starting in early January. Kavanaugh has lectured at the Law School for roughly a decade.
In their letter, the professors wrote that “judicial temperament” numbers among the “most important qualities of a judge” and that Kavanaugh’s lack of composure at his hearing is “disqualifying” for a nomination “for any court, and certainly for elevation to the highest court of this land.”
The professors also criticized Kavanaugh for calling the hearing “partisan” and for displaying agitation over Senators’ questions.
“Instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the allegations that were raised, Judge Kavanaugh responded in an intemperate, inflammatory and partial manner, as he interrupted and, at times, was discourteous to senators,” the professors wrote.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 was not among the letter’s signatories as of late Thursday.
Correction: Oct. 4, 2018
An Oct. 3 version of this article listing the then-25 Harvard Law professors who had signed the New York Times editorial left off Law School professor Bruce Hay. The Crimson regrets the error. The article was updated to remove the list of Harvard signatories after the number grew significantly over the course of the day on Oct. 4.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow acknowledged in his first full-length sit-down with The Crimson last week that the brand-new, Republican-backed tax on Harvard's $39.2 billion endowment will deal a blow to the University — but said he will protect the school's financial aid programs at almost any cost.
The University will pay taxes for the first time on its fiscal year 2019 returns, meaning it won’t actually shell out money to the federal government until the fall of 2019. The funds to pay the tax — which is calculated based on the school’s endowment annual returns, rather than the total endowment sum — will have to come out of the University’s annual operating budget.
“I can’t tell you where the money’s going to come from,” Bacow said. “But if you ask me what are my priorities, my priorities would be to save money in other areas. The last thing which I would do is cut financial aid.”
Last week the University announced that its endowment returned 10 percent, faring better than it has over the past two years. The unprecedented endowment tax — the product of last year’s Republican tax overhaul — would have cost the University $43 million in 2017, according to Harvard’s estimates. Bacow said that amounts to about $2,000 per every student who attends Harvard, or roughly 25 percent of the school’s total undergraduate financial aid budget.
As the value of the endowment increases, Harvard will likely pay even more; based on its 2018 returns, Harvard would have owed the federal government more than $50 million this year.
Even as the first fiscal year of taxation begins, Harvard hasn’t given up the fight to eliminate the new levy. On Bacow’s first trip to Washington, D.C. as Harvard’s top leader, he told legislators on both sides of the aisle that the tax will fail to accomplish their goals.
“I talked to them about the federal endowment tax, why I thought that was poor public policy, the specific impact it had on Harvard, why I thought it not only would not achieve its intended goals — which are to ‘reduce the cost of admission,’ we'll call it the cost of attending college — but why it would have the exactly opposite effect,” Bacow said.
Not only would the tax potentially increase the cost of higher education, Bacow said, it would make it harder to fundraise for scholarships, too. He explained that it is harder raise money for financial aid when endowed scholarships are going to be taxed.
Bacow emphasized that the tax is a broad political issue — not one unique to Republicans. He pointed to the additional endowment tax Massachusetts Democratic candidate for governor Jay Gonzalez proposed last month.
“I don’t want to label this as a Republican issue or a Democratic issue,” Bacow said. “It’s an issue for us and it’s an issue across the board. We need to do a better job of making the case for higher education.”
Bacow’s desire to advocate for higher education is one that his predecessor, former University President Drew G. Faust, shared. Since taking office, Bacow has traveled to his home state of Michigan to speak to high school students there. Faust similarly visited cities and schools across the Midwest throughout her tenure.
“One of the reasons why I’m spending as much time as I am in D.C. and will spend it there but also traveling around the country, engaging in conversations with others, is because I believe so passionately in the mission of higher education,” Bacow said. “I think institutions like this really, really matter and so I think it’s important that I and others continue to try and make the case for why they are worthy of public support, and we can’t take that for granted.”
For now, though, Bacow said the endowment tax will necessitate “belt-tightening” in certain areas — even after the University wrapped up its capital campaign by raising a record-smashing $9.6 billion.

Eight of the students and alumni who petitioned to testify at the upcoming Harvard admissions trial will have the opportunity to speak in support of the College in court, U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled Wednesday morning.
Burroughs’s ruling came as part of the case’s final pre-trial hearing, which lawyers for Harvard attended along with attorneys for Students for Fair Admissions — the anti-affirmative action group that sued the University in 2014 over allegations that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Harvard has repeatedly denied all allegations of discrimination and argues the consideration of race in the admissions process is vital to achieve diversity at the College.
Six alumni and eight current students, some of them representing University-affiliated organizations, had previously asked the court for permission to testify in favor of Harvard’s affirmative action policies. Lawyers representing some of the students wrote in previous court filings that their clients are uniquely positioned to share their experiences as “ethno-racial minorities.”
Harvard asked the court last month to admit testimony from the students and alumni. SFFA, however, claimed such testimony would be irrelevant, arguing that the individuals are unfamiliar with the intricacies of the Harvard admissions process.
But the student and alumni petitions — as well as Harvard’s on their behalf — won the day. When the trial begins on Oct. 15, the witnesses will have their day in court — though that means they may also be subject to cross-examination.
Judge Burroughs wrote in a Wednesday court order that she believes some of the additional testimony would “advance justice.”
“Both amicus groups offer to present testimony from individuals with valuable perspectives that will otherwise be absent from the trial record,” Burroughs wrote.
Burroughs also handed down a ruling Wednesday regarding what evidence will remain sealed in the case. She said that any documents that either Harvard or SFFA “rely on” in the trial must become part of the public record. Burroughs agreed to grant certain exceptions, however, agreeing to redacting sensitive information such as students’ names.
“If we rely on it, I feel like it should be in the public domain,” she said.
Burroughs asked that both parties limit the volume of their evidence submissions in order to avoid “a wholesale data dump” that would unnecessarily prolong the trial.
How confidential information is handled in the case was a major bone of contention between Harvard and SFFA in the pre-trial phase of the suit. SFFA pushed for the unsealing of many documents filed as evidence — such as internal admissions office emails and student application files — while Harvard repeatedly demanded privacy for its students and faculty.
Several thousand of pages revealing previously confidential details of Harvard’s admissions process — ranging from the school's rating system for applicants’ “personal qualities” to the substantially higher admit rate seen by Harvard legacy students — became public over the summer.
Another outstanding disagreement between SFFA and Harvard was whether Harvard’s history of anti-Semitic discrimination during the early 1900s may be discussed at the trial. Burroughs decided the evidence would be allowed at the trial, but only in a “very limited” capacity.
Harvard previously argued any historical discrimination has no bearing on the current allegations, while SFFA argued the decades-old evidence points to a history of discrimination perpetrated in the College's applications process.
Burroughs told the lawyers she believes this history is of “limited relevance” since a “vast amount of time” has passed since that era of admissions at the College.
“I don’t find it particularly relevant, but others may,” Burroughs said, adding that she believes the court should “develop as thorough a factual record as possible.”
Though the trial was originally scheduled to last three weeks, Harvard and SFFA suggested they may need as long as four weeks in a joint Monday filing. Burroughs, however, asked the lawyers Wednesday to limit the duration of the trial.
Judge Burroughs asked the attorneys whether they believed space in her courtroom would be sufficient and — expecting significant public interest in the trial — determined the case may require an overflow courtroom.
Burroughs — who serves at the U.S. District Court in Boston — will adjudicate the allegations of discrimination in the October trial without a jury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across four competitions this weekend, the Crimson was forced to navigate through rough waters.
The Jen Harris Women’s regatta in Annapolis, Md., saw two days of spotty conditions in which unfavorable winds prevented the regatta from completing its entire slate of races. Harvard secured a ninth place finish in a pool of 17 teams, and the performance ensured the Crimson the last qualifying position for the Women’s Showcase Final in two weeks’ time.
Harvard’s A-division boat was led by senior skipper Taylor Gavula for the first six races and first-year Emma Kaneti for the following four. Sophomore crew Emily Wang raced in all 10 events, and the team overall ended with 106 points after finishing in the top five in just one of its ten races.
However, the success in the B-division boat, led by junior skipper Lucy Wilmot and senior crew Alejandra Resendiz, kept the Crimson in the top 10 overall.
“It was a nice outing for us, especially since we didn’t qualify for a culminating showcase last year,” Wilmot said. “We felt like we had stronger boat handling than the other girls.”
The B-division boat finished sixth with 74 points, helping Harvard secure the team’s place in the showcase final.
The Moody Trophy, hosted by the University of Rhode Island, was characterized by similar wind inconsistencies and saw a competitive pool including Boston University, Rhode Island, Yale, and Tufts. Harvard finished fifth, edging out Brown by 2 points.
In the A division, sophomore skipper Eli Burnes and senior crew Lena Episalla finished fourth on a tie-breaker. In the B division, senior skipper Andrew Puopolo and junior crew Iulianna Tarista finished fifth, just ahead of the Bears.
MIT hosted a third in-conference regatta this weekend. The George Warren Smith Trophy, named in honor of an MIT professor and ex-sailor, saw Tufts take first and second places at the end of the weekend.
The A-division boat started the weekend with first-year Frankie Doyle at skipper and sophomore Gayatri Balasubramanian at crew. Doyle found “the conditions [to be] tricky,” yet he still “found [his] rhythm and managed to score the lowest on the day.”
The second day of competing for the Smith Trophy, however, ended with the team finishing in ninth place after Doyle was replaced by junior skipper Catherine Kerner and one of the Crimson’s finishes from the first day was disqualified.
In the B division, freshmen Eric Hansen and Katherine Barkin finished in seventh place after two days of racing.
To round out the weekend, the Danmark Trophy, a regatta hosted by the United States Coast Guard Academy, was composed of a tough fleet. Among a competitive field of schools including Stanford, University of California at Santa Barbara, Boston College, Yale, and MIT, Harvard finished eighth on a tie-breaker.
In the B division, senior captain Nick Karnovsky and junior captain Jessica Williams finished the weekend in first place, outlasting Tufts by two points. The A-division boat, sailed by sophomore skipper Henry Burnes and senior crew Catherine Tang, finished in 13th place, contributing 62 of the team’s 88 total points — an undesirable statistic in a regatta, where lower scores reflect higher finishes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Life is good when your dynasty takes just a brief respite before returning in all its glory.
As a New England Patriots fan, I’ve seen this play out first-hand this season and in a few seasons past. Two straight losses, one to the Detroit Lions, had detractors salivating and clamoring to fire off tweets about how the Tom Brady is done, Bill Belichick is finished, and the Patriots are history. The team responded by blowing out the Miami Dolphins, 38-7, and even though the Dolphins aren’t necessarily elite competition, I’ll go out on a limb and say that it’ll win the AFC East for the tenth consecutive season (not really the highest of accomplishments, but oh well).
Harvard’s rebuilding phase was slightly longer than that of the Patriots, but it still wasn’t excruciatingly lengthy. I mean Brown hasn’t won the league since 2008, Cornell last came out on top in 1990, and Columbia fans have to go back to 1961 to find the sole instance the Lions secured the trophy, so at least the team’s fans haven’t suffered through that. After a 5-5 finish last season, the Crimson appears to have improved team chemistry and play-making ability about a third of the way through its 2018 campaign. Yes, I’m saying this after Harvard lost for the first time this season, but too bad. A take is a take.
And if somehow, some way, the Patriots and/or the Crimson fail to live up to my lofty billing? Well, you may just find all traces of this article scrubbed from internet history.
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
Football fans can be awfully partial to their version of the transitive property. The Browns beat the Jets, who beat the Lions, who beat the Patriots, so the Browns by definition are better than the Patriots, right? Well there’s a simpler version to that formula relevant to this game: Dartmouth beat Holy Cross, which beat Yale. So of course I’m taking Dartmouth over Yale this week.
Under 19-year veteran coach Buddy Teevens, the Big Green has started off 3-0, just as it did last year. In 2017, Dartmouth lost two crucial games — to Columbia and Harvard in back-to-back weeks — which dropped it just short of an Ivy League title. However, that means that Yale’s lone loss last fall was to the Big Green, in a game that featured a wild fourth-quarter finish.
This time, Dartmouth needs to travel to New Haven, Conn., to face off against the Bulldogs, but is it really home field advantage when your stadium is about a two-day journey from your campus?
Dartmouth by 1.5
LEHIGH AT PRINCETON
What do you expect when an Ivy League legend, Chad Kanoff, departs for the final time from Princeton’s hallowed halls? Not this.
Princeton has begun its 2018 season on what you could call a bit of a hot streak — it has blown the doors off three consecutive opponents, averaging 48.7 points per game on offense and conceding only 8.7 per game on the other side of the ball. The Tigers have averaged a 40-point margin of victory. Think about that. I know I don’t want to.
Behind Princeton’s offensive explosion is Kanoff’s heir apparent, John Lovett. So far, Lovett has completed 64 percent of his passes for nine touchdowns in the air, and he has tacked on an extra five on the ground. Lovett is one of the biggest enigmas in the league; in 2015 and 2016, he was a dual wide receiver and quarterback, and in 2016 he ran in 20 touchdowns and passed for 10 more.
With all of that said, betting Princeton in this game? I don’t like it, I Lovett.
Princeton by 30
MARIST AT COLUMBIA
As I said earlier, Columbia has not had the most luck when it comes to winning the Ivy League. Despite having one of its best seasons in recent memory last year, it still fell short, with one of its two losses coming at Harvard’s hands. Now that I think about it, the Crimson was a real spoiler last season. It didn’t work out perfectly, though, as its wins over Dartmouth and Columbia led directly to rival Yale claiming the trophy.
Just as I used Holy Cross as a proxy for picking the Dartmouth–Yale game, I’ll use Georgetown (poor, poor Georgetown) in this case. As expected, the Lions took care of the Hoyas in their week two game. Marist was unable to do the same. In fact, Georgetown beat the Red Foxes by 25. Yikes. I’ll roll with Bagnoli this time around.

BROWN AT RHODE ISLAND
This one’s going to be a real battle, folks. I devoted a full day to researching and writing this section and about twenty minutes combined on all the rest. After a grueling 24 hours of historical analysis, statistical modeling, interviewing college football experts, and throwing all that out the window and trusting my instincts instead, I’ve reached a decision: the Bears will win this game.
Weren’t expecting that, were you? Well, it’s true. I believe in Michael Hoecht, I really do. The guy got the entire press corps fired up and ready to run through a wall with his answers after Harvard beat Brown.
“You take out that first quarter of the game, we beat that team, 100 percent. Even the first 10 minutes,” Hoecht said. “We all know it.”
Chills.

HARVARD AT CORNELL
Two weeks ago, I spent the entirety of this column talking about a band — Led Zeppelin. Some readers probably appreciated it, and for others the rock genre is not necessarily their cup of tea. But the band I’ll talk about this week has not endeared itself to anyone — not a single person — throughout its history. I’m talking about the Harvard University Band.
A rag-tag collection of “musicians” playing seemingly whichever instruments they can find lying around before any given game, the Harvard band is even worse at running a Twitter account than it is at getting through “10,000 Men of Harvard” without a band member tripping over their own feet. This is not an unprovoked attack on an innocent band; it has levied a handful of mild sarcastic insults at our Twitter account over the years. (Shameless promotion: Follow us @THCSports. Do not follow @HarvardBand. And no, I don’t have thin skin. Why do you ask?)
I have a pretty simple solution to this problem, though. When Harvard returns home to face Holy Cross next Friday night, whoever is in charge should just send the band to the moon — if that’s not possible, the roof of the Smith Campus Center will do. It’s a win-win for all sides: inhabitants of Harvard Square get a free concert, Harvard Stadium can just let its sound system do all the work, and the band can finally make some friends at the renovated and #cool campus center.
Oh yeah, the football game. I’ll go with the Crimson.
Harvard by a billion
PENN AT SACRED HEART
Aside from the Dartmouth–Yale game, this might be the most evenly-matched contest we see this weekend — at least when you just look at each team’s record and its scores. Like I said earlier, I wasted all my time and energy researching the Brown–Rhode Island matchup.
To this point, I’ve picked Ivy League teams to win each game. Let’s mix it up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday at the University of Minnesota, the Harvard men’s cross country team finished in the top three of 15 teams at the Roy Griak Invitational, while the women’s side finished fourth amongst 14 teams. Junior Kieran Tuntivate led the pack, taking home first in the men’s 8000-meter run with a winning time of 24:33.4. Sophomore Abbe Goldstein also finished highly, placing fourth in the women’s 6000-meter run with a time of 21:33.1.
However, it wasn’t just Tuntivate that helped the men’s team finish near the top. Fellow sophomore Hugo Millner and junior Will Battershill followed Tuntivate, finishing third and sixth, respectively. Hugo Millner set a time of 24:36.8 and Will Battershill finished the race in 24:44.8.
The strong finishes by multiple runners helped the Crimson achieve a total score of 89 points with an average time of 25:02.72 and a total time of 2:05:13.60. Duke and Minnesota took the top two spots with scores of 74 and 77, respectively, while South Dakota State was a distant fourth with 132 points.
“We definitely need to try to close the gap between our top three and the rest of the team. If David [Melville], Luke [Laverdiere], and I can work together and pull that off, we should be a hard team to beat,” said senior Collin Price, who finished in 36th with a time of 25:34.1.
The women’s cross country squad found similar success, where sophomore Brooke Starn, who improved from her first race of the season, finished 18th with a time of 21:59.5. The women’s team had a total of five top-50 finishes, helping the team achieve a score of 115 points with an average of time of 22:06.26 and a total time of 1:50:31.30.
The results at Roy Griak Invitational have added a confident boost to many of the members, where Harvard hopes to maintain its momentum for the Pre-Nationals Invitational held on Oct. 13 at Madison, Wisconsin.
“Griak was a definitely a great showing for us," Price said. "The way we are training we should be running our best time later in the season. So, going into pre-Nats we’ve just gotta continue to stay mentally engaged throughout the race and we should continue to improve.”
Freshman David Melville finished top 50 with a time of 25:44.5 and freshman Luke Laverdiere finished with a time of 26:56.4. The team plans for each member to all finish near top to help the Crimson reach a ranking higher than third for Pre-Nationals.
On the women’s side, notable performances came from sophomore Anna Juul, who finished in 31st with a time of 22:17.5, and freshman Maya Rayle, who collected a time of 22:20.0 for 33rd place. The team trailed Minnesota (52 points), California Baptist (82 points), and South Dakota (106 points), but slipped in ahead of Montana State (133 points) and North Dakota State (173 points).
Harvard did not attend the Roy Griak Invitational last year, but the results look promising as both squads claimed top four rankings. The Crimson cross country team now prepares for the coveted Pre-National Invitationals on Oct. 3.

We all have that friend who never gets sick, or that suitemate who’s immune to oversleeping, but let’s make one thing clear: no one is safe from emo hours. As the semester progresses, you may find yourself hit by stronger bouts of disappointment, stress, angst, lostness, or heartbreak. What can we say? Harvard is hard. But Flyby has some recommendations for places to clear your mind when you need somewhere to wallow.
Under your desk
Your bed is an excellent pick and likely the first place that comes to mind, but if you’re looking for a change of scenery that doesn’t require leaving your room, the space underneath your desk can also be quite pleasant. Don’t forget to bring a soft blanket or sweater with you.
The Radcliffe Sunken Garden
Located near Agassiz House, this peaceful garden (with plants and a fountain!) is a lovely spot to take a few deep breaths.
The Science Center Observatory
While the Science Center might be the source of your problems, it can help to let the elevator take you above all your worries for a wonderful view from the eighth floor. If there’s a specific person making your life stressful right now, even they’ll look very small from way up there.
Wherever serves your favorite comfort food
Comfort food is powerful. Save this one for when you really need a moment when no one is allowed to judge your condiment choices or taco preferences. You deserve it. And your arteries will forgive you.
A graduate school
Harvard Law School’s beautiful campus is only a short walk from the Science Center, but it feels far, far away from undergraduate life and is a nice place to go for an hour or two to get away. Tourists, roommates, and acquaintances from section won’t see you looking sad here. On the off chance they do, maybe they’re here for the same reason — it’s a bonding experience!
Atop the John Harvard statue’s lap
While most of these options involve hiding, this one’s for the people who like to be front and center. You never know, a tourist could take a great dramatic candid of you.
We’ve offered you some ideally tranquil places, but don’t forget: nowhere is as comfortable as the arms of a friend. In all seriousness, if you’re having a rough day, reach out to those close to you to vent or get some help.

If you haven’t heard (or you’ve just been living in Lamont for the last two weeks), our new salmon-loving president, Lawrence S. Bacow, is getting officially inaugurated on Friday. If the plethora of emails promising an “academic procession” and a “Bacow Block Party” aren’t enough to convince you to attend, maybe we can. Read on to see why you should check out the inauguration.
Historical Factor
Bacow is only the 29th president ever installed, and the last time this happened was back in 2007. That makes the inauguration even rarer than the number of times you’ll walk to the Quad this year. And that’s saying a lot. Chances are you’ll be long gone before the next inauguration comes along.
The Bacow Block Party
Sick of hot and sweaty dorm parties? Well, you’re in luck! The Bacow Block Party gives you the chance to have fun in a beautiful, tourist-free (for seemingly the first time ever!) setting. Harvard Yard is also just a tad classier than your friend’s friend’s “giant” suite.
Cool Academic Regalia
With faculty encouraged to wear academia’s version of their Sunday best (aka the whole academic ensemble, robes and all), you won’t have to wait until graduation for the chance to see your favorite professors dressed up in those spiffy black caps. Besides, everyone knows they’re the peak of fashion.
For The “BaClout”
Do your friends back home not make enough fun of you for going to Harvard? Fix that problem by going and posting a picture on your snap story of you with those giant Widener banners. Your swipe-ups are guaranteed to be filled with snarky comments.
More Crowds than Trump’s Inauguration
This one’s self-explanatory. If the more activist-minded among you want to make a *real* difference, show up and stick it to a certain other president by ensuring that this inauguration has an even bigger turnout. That’s how activism works, right?
Obviously, there’s no reason not to hit up this once-in-a-lifetime event (unless you have a pset or essay due, in which case you get a pass). With the invite asking you to dress “as you would for work or class,” maybe this will finally be your chance to party in pajamas.
