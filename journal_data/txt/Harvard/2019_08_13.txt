After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
August is a unique vantage point for me to look forward to life at Harvard and to reflect on my gap year away from it. Please join me for a last adventure through some of the landscapes of my memories and my lessons learned.
First, climbing mountains always leads to achieving good perspective. I trekked for four days on the outer rim of Kathmandu, Nepal, and my final climb on the peak was up a half-finished building with no walls. On the roof, I watched the sun set over hills draped in curling smoke. In Hong Kong, I scaled a sharp mountain path, the “Dragon’s Back,” that ended in a quaint surf town at the bottom. I cooled off drinking a coconut on the beach. I witnessed the sunrise over earthy plateaus and the Judean desert from Mount Masada. And from a perch in Puerto Rico, I looked over a pure rainforest amidst a cacophony of wild fauna. Each time, the physical height gave me an incredible life perspective, because each peak was a reflective moment when I could ask myself, “How did I get here?”
There was much more than the physical climb that led me to each peak: I felt the ways my heart grew more open to adventure, how my strength swelled to mount the physical challenge and inner fears. At those peaks, as much as I was flooded with gratefulness for the people who stay in my heart no matter where I travel, there was also gratitude to myself for giving myself this time. It was a long journey to realize for myself that “selfish” wasn’t necessarily a bad word, but meant prioritizing my well-being. For the whole journey there was no trail to follow: my gap year was rushing into doors when they fortuitously opened and when they weren’t, following my intuition down untraveled roads. And now, I realize that maybe I don't need a mountain peak to have these revelations and feel this gratitude. I can feel it at home and on campus.
Second, failure is inevitable so fail with more vigor each time! I contacted around 50 alumni to learn about their career paths, but only a few replied. On top of that, I applied to about 60 internship positions over the entire year (most in industries I simply wanted to explore) and received second round interviews in less than 10 of those. At first, sending those emails and applications made me embarrassed and fatigued. Some days I felt so nervous after an email burst I would wait a few days, too scared to read the replies, if any.
But slowly, I became good, almost adept at failing. The reward — a warm-hearted conversation about someone’s life story, a new exciting opportunity — was always worth it. In the end, the handful of alumni I had meaningful contact with led to amazing experiences: While I visited Jerusalem, I spoke with a member of the city council about the Israel-Palestine conflict. I visited local offices in parts of Boston I had never explored before. I spoke with lawyers, filmmakers, health care policy experts, and non-profit organizers. And the worst-case scenario — no reply — didn’t hurt at all after a while.
As for work experience, I accepted a position I never expected at a political media company. I used to avoid all political conversation before and I was completely out of my comfort zone, but it was a brilliant experience for me. It pushed me to be active, knowledgeable, and opinionated in ways I had never been before. And I was open to it because I took to heart the advice that was repeated to me in all those career conversations: Even if you plan your whole life out, it will twist in ways you could never expect. Don’t take yourself so seriously. Keep a kitchen cabinet of friends and mentors behind you who want the best for you. In the end, you decide your own happiness.
Third, there are kindred souls wherever you travel, but sometimes the best person to have one-on-one time with is yourself. Every new friend and learning experience, I cherished as a pure gift, one I only had because I dared to find them. At the same time, there are adventures I cherish even more because I did it alone: travelling through armed checkpoints in Palestine, impulsively buying a 12-hour bus ticket to Lumbini, the Buddha’s birthplace, or realizing I had no cash at dinner and scrounging my way to my apartment in another city in Italy.
In some of those moments alone when I was brought to crisis, I completely fell apart and felt like a stranger to myself, a far cry from this image I had of walking back on campus with a poised, confident stride. And yet, there were also moments when I surprised myself with a flash of strength. There were moments I am still unable to express because of their deep, carving pain and moments I will never choose to express because of their precious beauty and secret holiness. Those, I can only have to myself.
It’s futile to explain all the takeaways of my gap year in one retelling. The very nature of what I learned rejects such a challenge. During the continuous journey of self-discovery and in the trials and tribulations that forge a career well-lived, there is never a well-marked linear path. It is not like climbing a mountain trail, when you mount the peak and say, “I have arrived. This is it.” Growth isn’t always in a direction: Sometimes it means pushing up against our hard corners in extreme times, and other times, it is pulling back to reveal an inner softness we forgot. At this point, I’ve given up on trying to label things. I just go where I feel is best. And Harvard, though always the ending place of my gap year, was never the final destination. The journey continues.

NINILCHIK, ALASKA – “First and last name?”
“Moonbeam. Just Moonbeam.”
I comb through my roster of volunteers, searching for her name among scrawly notes and half-completed spreadsheets. When I find it, I fasten a festival band to her wrist and write a dark check in sharpie.
“Thanks for volunteering, welcome to Salmonfest.”
Salmonfest is kind of like Woodstock, if Woodstock were fish-themed and held in a seaside village in Alaska. As the volunteer who checks in other volunteers, I’ve been afforded a front-row seat to the ins and outs of this quirky music festival: strange names, organizer drama, unpunctual bands, and more than one attendee in a fish costume.
I’ve also had the opportunity to observe the activist roots of Salmonfest. The festival was founded as an outreach campaign against Pebble Mine, a proposed project that threatens wild salmon habitat in Alaska’s Bristol Bay. Since Salmonfest has grown in visibility and popularity, its message has expanded to include other dangers to our fisheries, including climate change, improper waste management, and most recently, Alaska Governor Michael J. Dunleavy.
In late June, Dunleavy used his line-item veto powers to make devastating cuts to the Alaska state operating budget. He defunded many environmental and public safety programs, eliminated the state’s senior benefits program, and imposed massive reductions on the University of Alaska system. Alaskans across the political spectrum are furious.
Now, those infuriated Alaskans are trying to oust Dunleavy from office. The group is gathering petition signatures to put a recall on the ballot — and they’re making significant progress. They’ve been collecting signatures in cities, in rural areas, and at events like Salmonfest, where droves of people are passionate about changing our leadership.
I haven’t actually seen a person gathering signatures at Salmonfest. I still haven’t signed the petition. Nevertheless, I plan to, and I think tens of thousands of other Alaskans will too. Maybe it’s too easy to be optimistic when you’re surrounded by nearly around-the-clock sunshine and music, but I think we have a chance.

There was a firestorm last week when Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro tweeted the names of 44 of his constituents who had contributed the maximum amount to President Trump’s reelection campaign. I’ve got news for you: Those 44 names barely touch the surface of the publicly available data about individual campaign contributions.
If you’re on the mailing list for any of the 26 candidates still dreaming of the White House, you’ve heard that presidential campaigns had to report their quarterly fundraising numbers in the middle of July. When August rolled around, that information became freely available. Thanks to the Federal Election Commission, I can find out everything about your political donations — and so can anyone else with an appetite for spelunking through obscure public datasets.
By “everything,” I mean detailed information about every contribution over $200 made to a congressional or presidential campaign for the last 20 years. (Plenty of donations under that limit also appear in the data.) If you’re a high contributor — more than $500 at a time — I can see every contribution for the last 40 years. “See” also has invasive subtext: The dataset will show to whom you donated, the exact dollar amount of your contribution, and what date the transaction occurred. One more thing — attached to your name is your occupation, your employer, and your home zip code.
I’m all in favor of open data — I’m studying academic economics — but this is too much.
In a world where foreign powers have demonstrated themselves all too eager to meddle with American elections, we should all be able to agree that the integrity of our elections is threatened if we allow a whole bunch of untraceable money to slosh around our electoral system. We should also agree that voters deserve to know if their elected officials are accepting large donations from political interest groups. The FEC claims that its new individual contribution database tracks broad strokes in campaign finance. But if the original goal was to understand where campaigns get their money, the FEC has under-delivered on tracking campaign-level financial information and over-delivered on the tracking of individual contributions.
Ignoring for a moment the exposure of occupation and home zip code, there’s a quiet idealist in me that wonders why it’s such a bad thing to have one’s political contributions be publicly known. Shouldn’t political donors have the courage of their convictions and put their mouth where their money is? Wouldn’t we all vote — with campaign cash as well as at the ballot box — with a little more community-mindedness if others knew where we stood? As outraged as Republican commentators were by Castro’s tweets last week, maybe this is the price we pay for protecting campaign donations under the law as a form of political speech. If you want protections, you very well better make that speech out loud.
But I reject that idealistic impulse because I know that it takes a high form of privilege to bear the brunt of politically unpopular choices. We should hold on to the privacy of individual, small-dollar campaign contributions just as vociferously as we hold on the notion of the secret ballot. I wear my politics on my sleeve, but not every American is prepared to do that, and we shouldn’t require that of anybody. What if you’re not a Democrat in a place like San Francisco or Cambridge?
It’s easy to imagine how individual contribution data can be misused. What if a quick search of the contribution database becomes a standard way for employers to “get a feel for” potential hires? And what if there’s a false positive — a quick search of the database reveals that a retiree with my name living in South Carolina donated $28 to Trump last year.
Should we really expose small business owners — and their employees — to the threat of boycotts because they quietly express their politics in the form of small online donations to locally-unpopular partisan committees? If we want to reject discrimination based on political affiliation, we can’t make that information publicly available en masse.
A few hours surfing the database may affect my individual relationships. At home, I noticed that a relative made a political contribution contrary to the political affiliation I always projected onto him. At school, I saw the itemized contributions of multiple professors. At work, I had always tiptoed around the topic of Trump with a colleague who I knew to be a Republican. The FEC data revealed donations to the president’s reelection campaign. Could that change the way I talk to him? Maybe.
I also enjoyed some less nefarious uses of the data. Which random political campaigns sweet-talked my grandparents into giving money? Who are my neighbors supporting in the early days of this primary? I was able to look at the contribution records of my state senator at home and my favorite candidate for the Cambridge City Council.
But satisfying mere curiosity isn’t enough to obscure the plain truth: In trying to tackle campaign finance reform, the FEC has built a juggernaut of a privacy violation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will recommit $20 million to a program designed to foster affordable housing opportunities in the Greater Boston area, the University announced Monday.
The program, dubbed the “Harvard Local Housing Collaborative,” extends funding to three local nonprofit organizations — the Local Initiatives Support Coalition, BlueHub Capital, and the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust — according to a press release.
“The financing that is provided through the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative is flexible, low-cost, and available at the critical, early-stages of development — such as during land acquisition and predevelopment, making it a particularly attractive — and oftentimes crucial element for developers,” according to the press release.
Harvard initially created the program in 2000, then known as “20/20/2000,” which provided $20 million in low-interest loans. The program has since contributed to creating more than 7,000 units of affordable housing — including more than 1,600 units in Cambridge — according to the press release.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the release he was proud to work to “strengthen the region” and address the local demand for affordable housing.
“We are grateful to all of our partners for their support and their efforts to increase access to homeownership and promote fair and equitable access to housing,” he said.
Several Cambridge officials praised the University’s new efforts following the announcement Monday.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern called the plan fantastic in an interview Monday, and said he believes ongoing talks between the city and the University contributed to the decision.
“I don’t know if you want to call it pressure or if you want to call it advocacy, but I'm sure that the discussions that we’ve been having in the city have been an influence,” he said. “I'm glad that that connection has been made.”
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said in the press release that the University has been an “exceptional partner” in addressing many of the city’s issues, including affordable housing and public education.
Not everyone, however, was content with Monday’s announcement. While Cambridge City Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui said the program is a “positive step,” she added that the relationship between the University and city requires a bigger contribution on Harvard’s part.
“It is great that our housing providers can have some of these monies up front, because it's very difficult to fund affordable housing,” she said. “But I think, you know, 2019 is very different from the year 2000. So those amounts should be reflective of that, and land costs have gone up as well.”
University Spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “incredibly pleased” with the program’s success in creating affordable housing units.
“It also reflects one of many ways that Harvard and Cambridge partner together on shared priorities and critical needs for our community— such as sustainability, economic mobility and public realm improvements,” she wrote. “We look forward to continuing these meaningful partnerships and working together on countless initiatives that are important to the City, to Harvard, and to the region.”
Members of the Council have previously criticized the University for not doing enough to alleviate the city’s housing crisis.
David E. Sullivan, a Cambridge resident and former City Councilor, said he is grateful to the University for “stepping up” on the issue of affordable housing.
“Harvard, you know, creates a need for affordable housing, because it's a major employer,” he said. “So it is important for Harvard to play a role in helping to solve the problem.”
