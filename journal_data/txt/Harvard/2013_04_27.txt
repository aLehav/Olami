After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston attorney conducting an outside investigation of Harvard’s email search scandal will share a written report of his findings with the Harvard community, according to a statement issued Friday afternoon by William F. Lee ’72, the Harvard Corporation subcommittee chair overseeing the external review.
Lee’s statement did not indicate when or how the report will be shared with various segments of the community, but it did say that the attorney, Michael B. Keating of Boston-based Foley Hoag, hopes to finish his investigation by June 30.
“At the request of a Corporation committee, Mr. Keating’s review is focusing on the facts bearing on any searches of email or email metadata done in connection with the Administrative Board proceedings relating to a take-home exam in a spring 2012 undergraduate course,” Lee wrote.
The Boston Globe first reported on March 9 that Harvard administrators had authorized secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts in an attempt to identify the source of a leak of internal communication pertaining to the Government 1310 cheating case. In a statement two days later, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote that the searches had been limited to subject-line searches of the deans’ administrative accounts.
That statement contained a number of inaccuracies, and on April 2, Hammonds revealed to faculty at their monthly meeting that she had authorized a set of additional searches of both the administrative and faculty accounts of the resident dean identified by the first search. That second round of searches violated the FAS email privacy policy.
University President Drew G. Faust announced at that April 2 meeting that she had commissioned Keating to verify the findings of the University’s own initial investigation of the searches. Faust will sit alongside Lee, trial lawyer Theodore V. Wells, Jr., and Tufts University President Emeritus Lawrence S. Bacow on the special Corporation subcommittee. The Harvard Corporation is the University’s highest governing body.
New details about the report’s timing and distribution come two weeks after the FAS Docket Committee, which is responsible for setting the agenda of monthly faculty meetings, wrote an email to Faust requesting clarification about the scope, timing, and distribution of the Keating investigation. In particular the Docket Committee, which consists of three members of the elected Faculty Council, wanted to know whether or not faculty would be made privy to the final report.
Faculty members, including history professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, the vice-chair of the Docket Committee, said at the time that given the inaccuracies in previous administrative statements about the searches, the report would bear little weight unless shared in some way with the community.
Jasanoff said Friday evening that she was satisfied with the details offered by the Corporation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It didn’t take long for the Baltimore Ravens to fill the Harvard void on their roster.
Just months after the most accomplished football player in Crimson history—center Matt Birk ’98—retired from the squad, the reigning Super Bowl champions selected Harvard H-Back Kyle Juszczyk with the 130th overall selection in the fourth round of the NFL Draft on Saturday.
The senior becomes the first Harvard player drafted since Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and the 20th all-time.
“Couldn’t be happier to be a Baltimore Raven! Dream come true! Now it’s time to work! #PurpleandBlack #NFL,” Juszczyk tweeted.
The selection culminated a steady rise up NFL Draft boards for the former Harvard tight end who gained the attention of scouts at the Senior Bowl but was surprisingly not invited to the NFL Combine. Despite the snub, Juszczyk was considered one of the draft’s biggest risers and came to be rated the best fullback prospect in the draft by ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr.
“I expected Kyle to be drafted in the 4th or 5th round and the 4th was a  bonus,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy wrote in an e-mail. “For a lot of reasons I think Baltimore is a great fit for Kyle.  Obviously it's a great organization, they have a strong future need at  his position and they did a great job analyzing his skill set.”
The senior led the Crimson during the 2012 season with 52 receptions, 706 yards, and eight touchdowns and established program records for tight ends in those three categories. Over the course of his career, he earned a number of accolades, including being named a first-team All-American by the Associated Press last season.
With Baltimore fullback Vonta Leach entering the final year of his contract, Juszczyk met with the Ravens in mid-April as one of his at least 12 visits to NFL teams.
“A lot of the people on the Ravens, [coach John] Harbaugh, who coached with me at the University of Cincinnati, as did Craig Ver Steeg, and their special teams coach and one of their secondary coaches...they’ve called several times—they have a particularly strong interest [in Juszczyk],” Murphy said earlier this week.
The coach was right, and the Ravens made Juszczyk the fourth Murphy alumnus to have his name called in New York City.
“I had a lot of options, I really wasn’t sure where I would end up,” Juszczyk said. “I kind of had a good feeling after leaving Baltimore that that would be a good fit for me.”
The Medina, Ohio native said the Ravens particularly valued his versatility.
“When they spoke to me they mentioned [I would be] kind of a move fullback, someone they can use to line up in a lot of different formations,” Juszczyk said. “I don’t think I’m that traditional old-school kind of fullback who’s going to run isos all day.... I think there are other ways I can be used.”
The senior was chosen just eight selections after the first Ivy Leaguer came off the board—Cornell guard J.C. Tretter, who went to the Green Bay Packers—making 2012 the first draft in 15 years that two Ivy League players were selected in the first four rounds. Princeton defensive lineman Mike Catapano was taken by the Kansas City Chiefs with the first selection of the seventh round, giving the conference three draft picks for the first time since 2001.
“It’s always cool to see the Ivy League get a little respect and [to have] people recognize that we play some serious football up there,” Juszczyk said.
As he moves on to the next stage of his career—Baltimore’s first OTAs begin in less than a month—the H-Back has already earned the support of Ravens fans by expressing a smashmouth attitude on his conference call.
“Physicality has always been one of my strongest traits,” Juszczyk said. “I’m not going to shy away from hitting somebody in the mouth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout its season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team has shown flashes of brilliance, pushing multiple nationally ranked teams to the brink of defeat. The Crimson did just that against No. 15 Yale on Saturday afternoon, but—as was the case against No. 5 Duke and No. 6 Cornell—Harvard could not finish the job, losing by one goal.
In the teams’ regular season finale, the Bulldogs (9-4, 4-2 Ivy) defeated the Crimson, 11-10, at Harvard Stadium. With the loss, Harvard (6-8, 2-4) concludes its second consecutive season without an Ivy League Tournament bid.
A goal from senior attacker Jack Walker with 36.6 seconds left in regulation pulled the Crimson within one. Off the next faceoff, senior Bulldog attacker Kirby Zdrill was immediately called for holding to give Harvard its first man-up opportunity of the game and a chance to extend its season.
“I honestly thought we were going to tie the game up and go to overtime,” Crimson captain Jason Gonos said. “Our man-up’s been great this year.”
But Yale goalkeeper Eric Natale made two saves in the final half-minute to secure the win for the Bulldogs. Six seconds into the man-up, the sophomore blocked a close-range shot from Harvard senior attackman Henry Mumford. The Crimson recovered the ball and cycled it to sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde, who unleashed a final 10-yard shot that found the goalkeeper’s stick.
With the win, Yale clinched the second seed of the Ivy League Tournament, which will be held next week in Ithaca, N.Y. Harvard, which finishes the regular season tied with Brown for fifth place in the conference, needed a victory Saturday to crack into the top four tournament-qualifying teams.
On Senior Day, attackman Ian Ardrey led the Crimson with four goals. The freshman entered the game with only five career goals.
“I thought [Ardrey] moved really well off ball and was finding seams in their defense,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said.
Junior attackman Peter Schwartz also recorded a hat-trick for Harvard with three of the team’s first four strikes as the Crimson dominated possession early in the contest. Harvard jumped out to a 3-1 lead by the end of the first quarter, but big Bulldog runs in the middle two frames allowed the visitors to pull ahead and hold on.
Yale opened the second quarter with its first of four man-up goals with a strike from sophomore midfielder Shane Thornton. The Bulldogs had six man-up opportunities on the day before Harvard received its first at the end of regulation.
Schwartz responded just over a minute later with his third goal of the game, but Yale proceeded to go on a 3-0 run. The run culminated in a strike from Zdrill, who faked a pass to the top of the box before rolling to the crease for a go-ahead goal. The senior finished the afternoon with a team-high four goals.
After Ardrey’s second goal tied the game at five with two minutes left in the first half, the Bulldogs enjoyed a 4-0 run to start the third quarter. Yale scored four times in less than three minutes, including two from Zdrill less than a minute apart, to take a 9-5 lead. The Bulldogs’ last two goals of the run were on the man-up as the Crimson’s frustration began to show with one-minute penalties to junior defender Joe Petrucci and senior faceoff specialist Rick Molé.
“They were capitalizing on a couple of our mistakes,” Gonos said. “They had the momentum in the second and third quarter, and it took us a little too long to get our momentum back.”
Harvard finished the game on a run of its own, outscoring Yale, 5-2, over the game’s final 20 minutes. The Crimson’s comeback was sparked by two late-third quarter goals less than 15 seconds apart by Ardrey and senior attackman Alex White, who finished with two goals.
In the final frame, Molé won all five faceoffs for the Crimson to finish the day 18-for-24 in faceoffs. Two goals from Ardrey and a goal from Walker cut the Bulldogs’ advantage to one, 11-10. Walker’s shot with just fewer than 40 seconds left appeared to catch the leg of Natale before trickling across the goal line.
But the visiting goaltender would not miss again with two final stops down the stretch. After the game, Wojcik reflected on the Crimson’s season.
“We never quit. I thought we got better as the year went on,” Wojcik said. “Maybe throw the Princeton game out, but we got better as the year went on. We just came up short.”
Yale will meet Penn in the first round of the Ivy League Tournament on Friday. Top-seeded Cornell will play Princeton.

Visitors making their way through Harvard's campus over the last few days have witnessed the full extent of Harvard's beauty. Some might think it's commonplace for students to cheerfully bask in the warmth. Little do they know of the dreary grey pall that seems to envelop Cambridge from November to March.
Picturesque days like these, when students sprawl out in the Yard to sunbathe and attempt to read for class, are precious because of their scarcity. Tragically, these days seem to return to us at the busiest times of year, as final projects, papers, and exams loom just beyond the sunny horizon. To help you concentrate on work amidst these unbearably wonderful days, we brainstormed a few ideas to keep you focused when all you want to do is toss around a Frisbee, chat with friends, and observe the hoards of tourists roaming aimlessly in the Yard.
1. Take Breaks. Resisting nature is an uphill battle. Make a schedule and reward yourself for hard work with 15-minute jaunts in the Yard or by the river. If you find yourself staring longingly at Facebook photos, take a break. No need to deprive yourself completely of some much-needed Vitamin D.
2. Find strength in numbers. Get some friends together and head to Lamont. You may not be able to resist the sunshine on your own, but finding a group to work with you will provide solidarity.
3. Make your own weather. While it may be gorgeous outside, if you shut your blinds and turn on some rain sounds, maybe you can fool yourself into thinking it is torrentially pouring outside.
4. Find a happy medium. Park yourself next to a big sunny window, so you reap all the benefits of the sunshine without the hubbub of the great outdoors. Try snagging one of the small tables in the Quincy dining hall or the comfy chairs in Ticknor Lounge.
5. Can't fight it? Embrace it. Get outside, throw on some headphones to ward off friends, and seclude yourself in a sunny spot to do your work while enjoying the weather.

Colorful shorts and chairs are back in season, the Science Center Plaza is flocked with dozens of Cantabrigians, and the new 'Porch' on Memorial Church is thronged with people—students, professors, tourists—lounging around on the smooth wooden benches, reclining on the steps, or chatting it up around the tiny silver tables. But one can only lounge so much. Here are some interesting ways to take advantage of this new common space.
1.    Section Outside: Who wouldn't want to escape that stuffy room on the third floor of Sever? You could easily fit a small class on the porch, either seated in the chairs or just lying on the steps, and who knows, your comments might even sound smarter out in the fresh air. Now you've just got to convince your TF.
2.    Sunbathing: The trees haven't quite started to block out the sun yet, but when they do Memorial Church will be an ideal place to catch some rays; the sky above the porch is tree-free and it's well-lit all day. Lie down on a towel or blanket and proceed to get tan—or burnt, if we're being honest. Just wear sunscreen!
3.    Declamation: Give a speech! Or maybe just host a rally if your oratory skills are a little rusty. There's plenty of space for witty signs and supporters of your cause, and whatever you're saying will sound so much more legitimate when you are standing in front of Memorial Church, framed by all that Greek architecture.
4.    Lunch Date: If you're just looking to relax and enjoy the view of Tercentenary Theater, then bag a lunch and grab a seat; listen to the birds, catch a breeze, or just people-watch as you stoically eat a sandwich.
5.    Boardgames/Poker: If you want to encourage friendly competition among your friends or just lose some money, then the porch works. The chairs and tables are great for small games, though their size might make these friendly matches a tad more intense.
6.    Workout: Only the best of us can run the steps of Widener, but Memorial Church is the perfect spot for a Rocky-esque workout that is less demanding and comes with a nice location for relaxing afterward.
7.    Art: Draw, paint, sculpt, chisel, mold! The area's got a cornucopia of subjects to choose from—trees, buildings, people, all uniquely shadowed—and it's just quiet enough not to disrupt your focus. Even if you don't already do art, there's no better place to start.
8.    Flashmob: No one will expect it. Gather some friends and look completely inconspicuous before breaking into your routine. If that kind of public spectacle isn't your thing, the wide, flat porch would still be great for a tango in the moonlight.

No rest for the weary! While their petition for a nap space in Harvard Yard awaits approval from the administration, the Nap Space Project has launched a Nap Map with recommendations of current siesta sites for sleepy students around campus. Here are some of our favorite picks from their Map.
Nap Room in Langdell Hall, Harvard Law School: The only space on the list actually intended for sleeping, the "nap room" hides deep inside the law school library. Located past the west end of the reading room on the fourth floor of Langdell Hall, the room of oversized beanbag chairs welcomes students inclined to recline. If Elle Woods didn't know about this space, she was, like, totally missing out on some seriously awesome beauty rest.
 
Memorial Hall Basement: HUDS roast turkey have you feeling heavy-eyed after dinner in Annenberg? Bus your tray and head on down to Loker Commons in the basement of Mem Hall. If the classrooms are occupied, the Nap Map proposes laying your weary head down on one of the many tables lining the hallway outside the Queen's Head Pub—not the most comfortable arrangement perhaps. Instead, you may want to consider trekking back to your own room for a more satisfying slumber.
 
Cabot Science Library: Need a rest between lectures in the Science Center? The Nap Space Project suggests curling up on one of the small, single-person sofas in the Cabot Science Library. In the likely scenario that the couches are occupied, it may be best to skip the snooze and opt for a coffee from the Greenhouse Café, instead. Finishing that p-set now means more real sleep later!
The Yard: The Nap Space Project urges you to embrace the springtime weather—lean back in a multicolored chair, lie down in the grass, or nod off beneath a tree. If you want to multitask, the Yard is your best bet. You can tan and get your daily dose of fresh air while you nap. However, be warned that you will likely become the subject of hundreds of tourists' photos.
