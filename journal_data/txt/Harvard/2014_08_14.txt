After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
To the Editor:
The Crimson’s coverage of the recent teaching forum for graduate students in the March 13 article, “Section Size, Teaching Concerns Center of Latest Graduate Student Forum,” included remarks by Professor Robert A. Lue describing the financial obstacles to reducing section sizes.
As a graduate student and teaching fellow keen to improve both the quality of undergraduate education and the working conditions of graduate students, I appreciate this important concern. Yet, I take issue with Professor Lue’s claim that “the fiscal reality we are in” is the source of these obstacles.
My disagreement stems from information covered in another Crimson article announcing a massive expansion in the size of the Bok Center, which Professor Lue directs. According to that article, the current FAS capital campaign has earmarked $150 million for “Leading in Learning,” split between the Bok Center, the SEAS Learning Incubator, and HarvardX. It would seem that “the fiscal reality” is that FAS is earmarking a huge sum of money for pedagogy at Harvard. Professor Lue would speak more accurately if he referred to the financial obstacles to reducing section sizes as a question of “fiscal priorities.”
A back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me $150 million would pay for tens of thousands of sections. In 2009, when FAS cut eight to 10 percent of section leaders, they aimed to save $2 million—1.3 percent of the “Leading in Learning” fund.
None of this suggests that the financial obstacles are insurmountable. Rather, it suggests that section size should form part of a broader conversation about pedagogical and fiscal priorities at Harvard. I would urge not only Professor Lue but also all members of the Harvard community to engage in that conversation, recognizing that how Harvard spends its money has a direct impact on the quality of undergraduate students’ education and graduate student employment.
