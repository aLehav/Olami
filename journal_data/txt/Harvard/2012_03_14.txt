After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday night, Donald B. Swegan watched his television screen intently when Princeton’s victory over the University of Pennsylvania granted the Harvard men’s basketball team is first ticket to the NCAA tournament in 66 years. For any Crimson fan, it was an exciting moment, but for Swegan—one of the ten Harvard players who made the trip to the tournament in 1946—it brought back a flood of memories.
“In those days, only eight teams went to the NCAA.... To be selected was quite an honor,” he said.
When Swegan, who came to Harvard for one year as part of the Navy V-12 program, later re-named NROTC, joined the basketball program in 1945, he found himself on a team largely made up of fellow Navy men.
According to Swegan, six of the Navy men playing for Harvard the last time the Crimson went to the Big Dance had been captains of their previous schools’ basketball teams.
“It just happened that we were all sent to Harvard at that time and came together as a very good team,” he said.
Swegan and his teammates traveled to Madison Square Garden in March 1946 to face Ohio State in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
“I certainly had never experienced anything like that, and I doubt if the other [players] had either,” said John D. Clark ’47, another member of the team. “To be in Madison Square Garden and to be a part of that was exceptional, something that went beyond any dream I had.”
Despite the team’s 46-38 loss to Ohio State, Swegan said he still remembers the game fondly. “I made the last shot in the game, and that threw off the point spread,” he said. “Ohio State was the favorite by 10 points. When I made that last shot, a huge roar went up from the crowd…. Everybody that was gambling was affected by my basket.”
Along with their memories, both Clark and Swegan said that they have held onto the personally inscribed Bellevue watches that were presented to each Harvard player at the tournament.
Looking ahead to this week’s game, Clark and Swegan noted that the playing field has changed considerably since they last donned their Crimson jerseys.
“It was never like March Madness,” Clark said. “It was a much smaller tournament.”
Swegan agreed, noting that in 1946, for example, three-point shots and dunking did not exist. “[Today’s] players, to be honest, are much better than we were. They’re bigger, they’re stronger, and they have moves that we didn’t even think of.”
While Clark will be watching Harvard’s game against Vanderbilt on Thursday from home, Swegan will attend the game in Albuquerque with Vincent F. Lackner Jr. ’72, another former Harvard basketball player who has led an effort to reach out to players from the 1946 team.
“I looked Don up and called him and said, ‘Is there any way we can get you to the game?’” Lackner said. The Friends of Harvard Basketball and the Varsity Club also assisted in the effort.
Swegan, who said he is looking forward to meeting this year’s players and men's basketball coach Tommy Amaker, already has his outfit picked out for the big game. “[I’m taking] my Harvard football letterman’s sweater,” he said. “I can still fit into it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just as it did when Duke visited Cambridge two years ago, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team fell behind big in its contest against the No. 14/15 Blue Devils Monday night.
This time around, the Crimson (2-3) managed to avoid a blowout with a desperation fourth-period comeback attempt that netted four goals. But the late flurry was not nearly enough, as Harvard fell to the Blue Devils, 11-8, in Durham, N.C.
The squads went into the half tied at four, but Duke (4-3) dominated the third period, scoring seven times while outshooting the Crimson, 14-8, to take an 11-4 lead.
“Duke did a great job capitalizing on our mistakes,” senior attackman Jeff Cohen said. “I give them a lot of credit. We were a little soft in the third quarter, and they took advantage of that.”
Jordan Wolf had two tallies in the period for the Blue Devils, who scored bookend goals 22 seconds into the quarter and with 12 seconds remaining—plus five times in between—to take control of the game.
It was a rough introduction to the collegiate level for highly-touted goalie prospect Jake Gambitsky, who was given a chance to start by Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 after junior Harry Krieger had suffered two consecutive losses.
“They just had a really good offense,” Gambitsky said. “I was just trying to keep my composure out there.... They were possessing the ball a lot and were getting some good looks inside. It took us a while to adjust.”
The Crimson finally adjusted in the fourth, scoring four times.
Cohen registered an unassisted goal 12:44 into the final period, and two minutes later, junior midfielder Ryan Stevens beat Duke goalie Mike Rock—also making his first start of the year—for Stevens’ first score of the season.
After back-to-back slashing and holding penalties on Duke’s Chris Hipps and Greg DeLuca, respectively, Cohen poured in two more man-up scores, his fourth and fifth of the contest. The senior currently ranks fifth in the nation in goals per game.
“Every time we need a goal, [Jeff] takes it upon himself,” Gambitsky said. “We count on him to pick us up and get one for us. He’s a big impact player, and he really makes a difference out there.”
But the Crimson was unable to muster anything else over the final 4:30 and dropped its third straight.
“We responded with a good fourth quarter, but in the end I think it was too large of a margin to overcome, and we couldn’t put it together in the end,” Gambitsky said.
Harvard jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the first. Ten minutes into the period, sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp beat Rock for the game’s first score. Moments later, Eipp found freshman Will Walker, who put the Crimson up two.
But the Blue Devils responded to tie things up. Just seconds after Walker’s goal, Duke’s Josh Dionne took a pass from Christian Walsh and beat Gambitsky to cut the deficit in half. Two minutes into the second period, Walsh provided the equalizer with an unassisted score.
Neither team could break the deadlock until Cohen scored his first goal of the game with 2:32 to go before the half.
That set up a flurry of scoring before the break, with Walsh adding his second of the night a moment later and Dionne scoring his second off a pass from Walsh with a minute remaining to put the Blue Devils up, 4-3.
Before the period was over, Cohen notched his second goal of the game off a Duke turnover, taking a pass from Eipp and beating Rock to tie things up heading into the break.
“I thought we played really strong in the first half,” Gambitsky said. “The offense was playing well, possessing the ball, and the defense was also playing well.”
Duke finished with 19 turnovers—10 of which came in the final period—but collected 32 ground balls, compared to 20 for the Crimson. Harvard outshot the Blue Devils, 48-36, on the afternoon, paced by 12 attempts from Cohen and nine from Eipp. But too many of those shots failed to turn into scores.
“We outplayed them for three of the four quarters, but at the end of the day, that’s obviously not enough,” Cohen said. “In the future we have to look to play a strong, complete game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After being swept in its first series of the season at No. 7 Arizona, the Harvard baseball team continued a tough early-season roadtrip this week, traveling to No. 19 Stetson for another non-conference test.
The Crimson managed to pick up its first win of the season Sunday night, topping the Hatters, 5-1, but dropped its remaining three contests in the four-game set at Melching Field in DeLand, Fla., to fall to 1-6 early in the season.
STETSON 9, HARVARD 7
After scoring just four runs in its first five contests, the Crimson offense broke out Sunday night and continued to do so Monday evening, plating seven runs. But the effort was not enough, as Stetson (13-3) broke a 7-7 tie with runs in the bottom of the seventh and eighth innings to take the series win.
The Crimson was hurt by five errors, which led to six early unearned Hatters runs off Harvard freshman starter Tanner Anderson that put Harvard in a 6-2 hole.
The Crimson began to climb back from there, with freshman catcher Ethan Ferreira delivering a two-out, two-run single in the top of the fifth to cut the deficit to 6-4. After a bases-loaded walk plated another Stetson run in the bottom of the inning, the Crimson rallied to tie it in the top of the sixth, beginning with a homer to deep left by sophomore shortstop Carlton Bailey.
“[Bailey’s] definitely been a big sparkplug for us,” senior pitcher Brent Suter said. “He’s stepping up in big ways [and] playing his heart out.”
Rookie center fielder Mike Martin then singled and was driven in by junior second baseman Kyle Larrow, who ripped a double down the right field line. Senior third baseman Jeff Reynolds added a single to center, scoring Larrow to tie the game.
But after getting the first three runners on in the bottom of the seventh, Stetson retook the lead thanks to an RBI single through the right side by Spencer Theisen. Trey Blackman singled home a Stetson insurance run in the following inning.
In the top of the ninth, Hatters closer Robbie Powell got Bailey to line out with the tying runs at the corners, ending the contest. Harvard outhit Stetson, 15-13, on the afternoon—including a 3-for-5 day from sophomore outfielder Jack Colton—but it was not enough to pull out the victory.
HARVARD 5, STETSON 1
In game two of Sunday’s doubleheader, the Crimson picked up its first win of the season behind one-run, five-hit ball from sophomore Sam Dodge, junior Matt Doyle, and junior Zack Olson.
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead in the top of the first on a Reynolds sacrifice fly. After Stetson tied the game in the second on a Blackman sac fly, Reynolds responded in the top of the third with an RBI single, scoring Martin.
Harvard plated two more in the second with a two-out rally. A Bailey single to left, scoring freshman right fielder Zach Boden, was followed by an RBI triple down the right field line by senior catcher Jon Smart to extend the Harvard lead to 4-1.
“Even in the games where we haven’t scored a lot of runs, we’ve had hits, but we’ve had trouble stringing a few together,” Reynolds said. “That’s what we did in that game.”
Smart tripled again to lead off the top of the ninth and was brought in by Reynolds. That was more than enough offense for Harvard, which featured five players with two hits on the evening.
“It just felt really good to get in that win column,” Suter said. “[Losing] gets to be frustrating.”
STETSON 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson was shut out for the second straight contest in a 3-0 loss to Stetson on Sunday afternoon.
The Hatters scored two runs in the fourth thanks to a wild pitch by Crimson starter junior Joey Novak and an RBI single through the right side by Mark Jones. Stetson added an unearned run in the seventh thanks to a Reynolds throwing error.
Hatters starter Lindsey Caughel improved to 3-0 on the season thanks to a dominating seven-inning, five-hit, 10-strikeout performance, while Robbie Powell earned his fourth save with two shutout innings in relief.
“We had a tough time getting anything going offensively,” Reynolds said. “[Caughel] pitched really well.”
STETSON 5, HARVARD 0
Harvard also dropped the series opener, as Stetson took advantage of four Crimson errors to score five unearned runs off Suter—who allowed five hits and struck out six over five innings—and junior captain Andrew Ferreira.
The Hatters scored three in the fourth thanks to a throwing error by sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan, which cost Harvard a chance at a double play. After the mistake, a sacrifice fly, single, walk, and two-run single by Robert Crews plated three Stetson runs before Suter finally got out of the inning.
The Hatters added unearned runs in the sixth and the seventh, while the Harvard offense could not muster a run against Stetson pitchers Kurt Schluter, Tucker Donahue, and Jake Boyd, who finished with nine total strikeouts.
“We just had a couple of tough innings,” Suter said. “We didn’t capitalize on opportunities both defensively and offensively to pull that game out.... We were happy with how we battled, but we’ve got to cut down on mistakes to be the team we want to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a multi-year hiatus, the Harvard men’s hockey team is back in the national rankings.
With its dramatic victory over Yale in the best-of-three ECAC quarterfinals series, the Crimson rocketed up the polls, more than tripling its point total from the previous week to nab the No. 19 spot in this week’s poll.
The expectations for Harvard coming into the season were low, to say the least. One preseason poll picked the Crimson to finish last in the 12-team ECAC while another pegged Harvard at seventh place. After all, the squad had struggled mightily for much of the 2010-11 season—the team started the campaign with a 4-18 record—and graduated its two goaltenders and many of its top players.
But the 2011-12 version of the Harvard men’s hockey team defied expectations, riding an NCAA-record 11 ties to a third-place finish in the ECAC and a bye in the first round of the conference playoffs.
All the while, voters in the USCHO.com Division I Men’s Poll were taking note. After receiving zero votes in the Feb. 20 poll, Harvard garnered 25 the following week. 14 days later, after topping Yale, the Crimson earned 95 points in Monday’s poll and leapfrogged a number of teams to enter the nation’s top 20 for the first time this season.
Harvard takes on rival Cornell in the ECAC semifinals this Friday in Atlantic City, N.J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last few months have been full of ups and down for Harvard athletics. Here at The Back Page, we took a look back and compiled a list of the moments that made this winter one that we may never forget.
Biggest letdown: Penn 55, Harvard 54
Another year, another one-possession Harvard basketball loss with major postseason implications. The Crimson was in control, 49-40, with 7:56 left in the game. The 11-point-favorite just had to hold on to keep destiny in its own hands and essentially clinch its first ever outright Ivy League title.
No problem, right?
Wrong. Zach Rosen picks Harvard apart defensively, scoring 11 of his team’s final 15. Harvard forgets how to shoot, only recording a dunk, a lay-up, and two free throws the rest of the way. And in the waning moments, a shot that goes in is called back. Penn emerges victorious by the score of 55-54. Eager fans ready to storm the court go home stunned and appalled.
Coach of the winter: Tommy Amaker
Someone alert Coach K. Tommy Amaker is coming for you. After 15 losing campaigns in 16 years, Cambridge’s second-newest cult hero came to town. Amaker didn’t waste any time; in the next three seasons he led the Crimson to a combined record of 92-55. This season, his squad set a program record for victories in a season, made the top-25 for the first time in program history, and, just a week ago, earned its first NCAA tournament appearance in 66 years. Thanks in part to an invigorated recruiting process, Amaker has helped change the course of Harvard basketball and for that, he is our coach of the winter.
Biggest Surprise: Jeremy Lin
Have you heard of him? This question may seem silly now, but it didn’t a couple months ago. In fact, when the Crimson questioned many fans at Madison Square Garden about Jeremy Lin ’10 over winter break, it got responses such as: “Jeremy who?” Just weeks before his explosion, Lin couldn’t even reserve a spot at the end of the bench, as Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni sent him down to the D-League’s Erie Bayhawks. Regardless, Linsanity (Lin link below) has since swept the nation’s heart and is here to stay.
Play of the winter: Curry's dunk on Mangano
Wish we had a picture to show you. For now, we will settle with a description.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—With just about 24 hours to go before the Harvard men’s basketball team faces No. 5 seeded Vanderbilt in the second round of the NCAA tournament, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker gave the media his thoughts on the Commodores and the tough test ahead.
After the interview, Harvard took to the court for an open practice in New Mexico’s University Arena, better known as “The Pit.”
And according Amaker’s scouting report, athleticism is one of Vanderbilt’s defining features.
“[The Commodores are] a veteran team, a team that can score,” Amaker said. “[They’re] very athletic, more athletic than people give them credit for being in the SEC conference with incredible, athletic teams.
“It didn’t surprise me they were able to make that run through the SEC Tournament,” he added. “We’re just hopeful that we can match their intensity.”
Vanderbilt—coming off of a win against No. 1 Kentucky in the finals of its conference tournament—also boasts good size, headlined by 6’11” center Festus Ezeli. But Ezeli, the Commodores’ all-time leader in blocked shots with 199, won’t be the only challenge that the Commodores’ balanced lineup presents.
“That’s something we talk about our ballclub a lot, is having great balance,” Amaker said. “They’re incredibly balanced with front line, strength, athleticism, scoring and incredible perimeter shooting. There are no holes with this basketball team.”
One of the more unsung contributors for Vanderbilt is senior Lance Goulbourne, who leads the Commodores in rebounding and has scored at least 10 points in 18 contests so far this year.
“[Goulbourne] is very athletic, 6’8”, an older player, veteran player, and very experienced player,” Amaker said. “He really relishes his role in…setting screens, getting offensive rebounds, keeping balls alive, sprinting the floor, blocking shots, doing a lot of things that…are sometimes overlooked.
“I think he’s a big piece of the puzzle for their ballclub.”
On the offensive end, Vanderbilt’s has shooting guard John Jenkins, who led the SEC for the second year in a row with 19.9 ppg.
“He’s as good of a shooter as we’ll face in our tenure at Harvard,” Amaker said. “He has deep range.... They do a number of things to get him shots, get him open. He has good size [and] he’s a terrific basketball player. You don’t lead the SEC in scoring and win the conference tournament without being an outstanding player and one of the top players in the country.”
But the Harvard players seem unfazed by the Commodores’ strong post lineup and outside shooting threats.
“They’re big, they’re strong and athletic,” junior forward Kyle Casey said. “But I think we’re prepared. We’ve played teams this season who have had a good frontcourt. I think if we just stick to our principles, we’ll be fine.”
And although the Crimson has a tough test ahead of it, the team says it’s ready to take on the upcoming challenge.
“We’re going to face a really talented team and hot team in Vanderbilt,” co-captain Oliver McNally said. “But we’re not just happy to be here and win our first solo Ivy title and just throw in the towel. We’re here to win, and that’s what we’re expecting to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The odds are certainly stacked against the Harvard men’s basketball team heading into its matchup with fifth-seeded Vanderbilt Thursday afternoon.
The Commodores, which entered the season ranked No. 7 in the country, are coming off a victory over No. 1 Kentucky in the SEC championship and boast an experienced, talented, and athletic lineup.
But as history has shown, crazy things happen in college basketball during the month of March. Here are three keys for a Crimson victory Thursday afternoon.
1. Crash the Boards
Rebounding is not something the Crimson is known for, but Harvard might want to change that if it hopes to emerge from Thursday’s matchup victorious. During the 2011-12 season, controlling the glass has been crucial to the Commodores’ success. In games that Vanderbilt outrebounded its opponents the Commodores went 18-2. In games in which it was outrebounded, Vanderbilt was just 5-8. The onus for getting on the boards will fall not just on the shoulders of forwards Keith Wright and Kyle Casey. Commodores’ wings Jeffrey Taylor and John Jenkins are second and fifth on the team in rebounding, respectively, meaning Harvard’s Christian Webster and Oliver McNally will need to box out.
2. Close Out on Shooters
In addition to helping on the glass, the Crimson’s wings will also need to clamp down defensively. Vanderbilt enters Thursday’s matchup as one of the nation’s best three-point shooting teams, connecting on 39.1-percent of its shots from beyond the arc. Especially crucial will be preventing John Jenkins, the SEC’s leading scorer, from getting hot. Jenkins is shooting 44.8 percent from deep and has knocked down at least four triples in 20 of 33 games.
3. Attack Festus Ezeli
I would say the Crimson should aim to contain Ezeli, but I think the only way that’s really possible is to have him far, far away from the court sipping Gatorade on the bench. The Commodores’ 6’11, 255-pound center presents a serious matchup problem for the Crimson. With the senior boasting a three-inch advantage on Wright, expect Ezeli to look for his shot early and often on offense and to make things difficult for Wright on defense. But in addition to being known for his strength in the post, Ezeli is also known for his propensity to pick up fouls; in four of his past five games, the center has been whistled for at least four fouls. If the Crimson can get Ezeli in foul trouble, it will open up Wright in the post and allow Harvard to run its inside-out offense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—Let me start off by saying that flights from Boston to Albuquerque are not cheap, which forced me (and the Crimson Sports board, with which I tagged along) to travel to Denver, where we rented an SUV to make the picturesque drive to Albuquerque, N.M. Thank you, NCAA committee, for that one, really.
Despite the remote location, I made the trip because I figured that, as a senior, it would be my last chance to go to the NCAA tournament as a current student and root for my own school.
Before earning its tournament berth this year, Harvard had not made it to the Big Dance since 1946, when the NCAA tournament invited only eight teams and was second to the then-bigger NIT.
Not only is this moment truly historic, but it is also a testament to how far the basketball program has come under Crimson coach Tommy Amaker.
In the time I’ve been here at Harvard, I’ve witnessed the drastic transformation, and I wanted to take in the final stage—the NCAA tournament—of such change for myself. Is it worth making my bank account cry as it took a significant hit?
As soon as we arrived today to UNM’s University Arena, otherwise known as “The Pit,” I was completely sure I had made the right decision to come this far.
The arena was undergoing final preparations for the tournament, though it was already adorned with welcome signs from the NCAA. Inside, the Pit was more majestic than what its nickname implies—the enormous below-ground arena could easily seat 10,000 people, and the basketball court was shining with the big NCAA logo smack in the middle, just like on TV.
As the Crimson writers and photographer went to work, I sat down with Ben Samuels, current Crimson president, to watch the open practices, each of them lasting 40 minutes. A few over a hundred fans were also present to see what the teams stationed in Albuquerque had to offer.
Out came the Montana Grizzlies, and grizzly they were.  A few players had full-grown beards, and they just seemed like a hard-working team straight out of the mountain ranges of that great Northwest state. They could really hit their jumpers, but it will be interesting to see how they will match up athletically with Wisconsin tomorrow. I didn’t stay for the Wisconsin practice, though I imagine they practiced like a No. 3 seed.
Up next was the Harvard Crimson. No longer a journalist for the Crimson, I stood up to cheer loudly along with the cheerleading team, which had made it in time to watch them practice.
Under the bright lights, the Crimson looked really good, which got my hopes up for tomorrow’s win even more. Coach Amaker made his players run a couple of fast-break drills along with some screen plays and shooting practice.
Nothing too strenuous for the 40 minutes they were out there, but the team looked solid and excited to be there. Harvard’s three-point shooting could use a little more work though, which made us debate whether Denver’s altitude may be playing a factor in their shots.
Regardless, that is an excuse that also applies to Vanderbilt, which hails from Tennessee, and, is just an excuse in the end.
Some notable tidbits:
-	The Crimson seemed super excited to be in Albuquerque, and it showed in their fast-paced drills.
-	There were a lot of dunks from Casey, Travis, and Saunders, among many other players, in the beginning of the session, which seemed once again to be a product of their excitement.
-	The team’s jump shots were falling, but the treys weren’t as much—let’s just hope this goes away by tomorrow.
-	Harvard’s ball movement and handling was excellent, but then again, this was against an invisible opponent. Turnovers will be a key statistic in tomorrow’s matchup—the Commodores are known to be turnover-prone, which is something the Crimson should take advantage of and convert into points.
-	Amaker’s team showed a lot of effort during a defensive drill that focused on forcing the opponent to taking a mid-range jump shot. If the shooter missed, Harvard was there ready to grab the rebound. This will be important tomorrow against a team that a) shoots the ball well but b) does not rebound effectively. If Vanderbilt has a poor shooting day and Harvard rebounds well, the Ivy League champion has a real chance at downing the No. 5 seed.
After watching the Crimson practice its free throws and retreat to the locker rooms, Ben and I decided to skip out on the Badgers’ practice for some grub. But we came back just in time to see Vanderbilt practice, and what an underwhelming session it was.
I’m pretty sure they spent more time shooting free throws, which most teams do at the end for a couple of minutes, than running plays and drills. The energy just wasn’t there, not from the players nor the coaches. I’m sure Vanderbilt did not want to give away too much during the open practice, but still, it was a little disconcerting how little enthusiasm the squad exuded.
The Commodores did exhibit their shooting proficiency, with senior Jeffery Taylor and junior John Jenkins catching my eye with the number of shots they made.
Festus Ezeli, one of the best centers in the SEC, practiced his post moves and made a fair amount of hook shots. He’s listed as 6’11, which surprised me because he did not look like it at all. We’ll see tomorrow when he stands next to Keith Wright.
Final tidbits:
-	“I’ll be rooting for Harvard, but it’s just too much of a stretch.” These are the words of our Commander in Chief and Harvard Law School graduate, President Barack Obama. Have some hope, man!
-	Albuquerque really loves Los Lobos, its basketball team. Papa John's was selling their apparel, and many signs around the city showed signs of support.
-	If Harvard basketball continues its meteoric rise, we’re going to need a Pit of our own. After sitting in UNM’s arena, Lavietes Pavilion, as historic as it is, just does not do it anymore. I can’t wait to visit Chapel Hill or Cameron Indoor one day.
-	I bought some memorabilia for tomorrow’s game—sorry, bank account.

There is now one more thing to do during the hours spent anxiously staring at your television waiting for Kyle D. Casey '13, Oliver R. McNally '12, and other members of the Harvard basketball team to appear in HD. Thanks to the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective, Crimson fans have a place to (virtually) compete to see who has the most knowledge of college hoops with Harvard's first Bracketology competition.
Betting is open to all students until Thursday at 10 a.m. EST. The rules of the game are simple: fill out which team you think will win each match-up, wait for the games to go final, and receive points for each correct pick. But, there's a kick: in this bracket-battle, correctly predicted upsets are rewarded more generously than cases where the higher ranked team comes out victorious. This suggests that picking just the top-seeded teams to win every game may not be the most profitable to one's overall score, depending on the results.
 
 The first-place winner of the Bracketology competition receives a $100 gift card to Amazon and the runner-up will win one worth $25. Best of all? There is no entry fee.
 So if you're feeling lucky, procrastinating spring break work, or just want to show off your basketball IQ, register and make your predictions. And remember, with Harvard as a number 12 seed, there are a lot of points that you can earn considering they make it all way the way to the final four.

March 11 marked the one year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami disasters in Japan. In 2012, the aftereffects of the natural disaster have not yet subsided, and many in Japan still find themselves without home or job. A Cambridge-based fundraising initiative called Bake For Japan hopes to give buyers the chance to make a difference in the lives of impacted individuals while simultaneously indulging buyer's sweet tooths.
After taking a few minutes to peruse the selection of delectable confections on the organization's website, users can press the "Click to bid" button next to their dessert of choice (be it that delicious chocolate cake or set of peanut butter frosting cupcakes.) If you are the highest bidder, not only will you enjoy your selected dessert, but you will also be able to choose whether your money goes to the Japan Disaster Relief Fund - Boston, the Kumagai family, whose story can be found here, or a charity of your choice.
Mariko Moher, a College Fellow in the Psychology Department and one of the bakers behind Bake for Japan expressed excitement about people's enthusiasm thus far.
"What's really thrilling is how supportive people have been," Moher said. "I think this is one way to keep what happened alive in people's memories."
The auction ends on Thursday, March 22 at 10 p.m. If you feel like giving and are looking for a delicious dessert as well, make your bid before that date.

Though the Harvard Crimson may be the main attraction in Albuquerque this week, the town has plenty of sights to keep you busy when you're not at a basketball game. Albuquerque is a place heavily influenced by Hispanic and Native American cultures, with a fusion of food, art, architecture, and music that can be hard to find in the Northeast. Below are Flyby's top five tourist stops.
 
Old Town Albuquerque
 
Old Town is the historical and geographical heart of Albuquerque. Since its founding in 1706, the neighborhood has grown to include five museums and over 100 shops and restaurants. The architectural centerpiece is the San Felipe de Neri church, established in 1706 and rebuilt in 1793. With thick adobe walls and rounded arches, the church is a jewel of Southwestern architecture. Be sure to check out the traditional arts and crafts sold in shops and on sidewalks, and try a traditional dish with green chilies.
 
American International Rattlesnake Museum
 
This museum is not for the faint of heart. Located in Old Town, the American International Rattlesnake Museum holds over 30 living species of snakes. The museum's website claims that they "host more different species than the Bronx Zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo, the National Zoo, the Denver Zoo, the San Francisco Zoo, and the San Diego Zoo" combined.
 
Sandia Peak Aerial Tramway
 
Just as skyscrapers comprise the skylines of New York and Boston, the Sandia Mountains are the outstanding feature of the horizon in Albuquerque. The word "sandia," which means "watermelon" in Spanish, describes the color of the mountains at sunset. The Sandia Peak Aerial Tramway takes visitors 2.7 miles above canyons and scrub brush to the top of a 10,378-foot mountain. From there, you can hike around or have lunch before your descent.
 
Indian Pueblo Cultural Center
 
Run by the 19 Pueblos of New Mexico, which is one of the largest Native American communities in the American Southwest, the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center provides visitors with an overview of Pueblo history and culture. The arts, crafts, and artifacts displayed in the museum span the centuries of Southwestern history, from the pre-Columbian era to today. Given the integral role Native Americans have had in the westward expansion of the United States, this is a learning opportunity specific to the region and not to be missed.
 
Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum
 
The biggest draw for tourists to Albuquerque is the International Balloon Fiesta, held in October. At this event, over 600 balloons climb into the beautiful southwestern fall skies as more than 100,000 spectators look on. You won't be able to attend this spectacle, but you can still visit the museum that takes the Fiesta as its subject. The Anderson-Abruzzo Albuqueruqe International Balloon Museum presents ballooning from a scientific and historical perspective, covering the basics of how balloons worked in the past and how they work today, the use of balloons in times of peace and war, and artifacts including coins, stamps, and artworks celebrating hot air balloons.
