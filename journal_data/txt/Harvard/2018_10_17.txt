After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, I was watching Pose, a TV show about transgender women of color and the ballroom scene in the 1980s, during the AIDS crisis. Produced by trans activist Janet Mock, Pose is making history by having the most trans series regulars on any TV show ever.
In one episode, there’s a scene where Blanca, a trans woman of color, stages a protest at a bar that caters to cisgender gay white men after the bartender and manager refuse to serve her. Here, we see a trans woman who already faces discrimination from cis straight people trying to find solidarity with other queer people at the bar, but she is shunned. The cis gay white men are more interested in upholding their own privilege than building community with trans women of color. This in itself is a strong message, but the show’s creators took it one step further.
While at the bar, Blanca notices that she’s not the only person of color in the room; there’s also a black cis gay man there. Hoping to find an ally in the room, Blanca points out that they’re the only two people of color in the room and tells him, “They don’t want us here.” His response? “No, they don’t want you here.” Upon hearing this, the manager gives him a free drink, “compliments of the house.”
This cis gay black man is both queer and a racial minority, like Blanca. He doesn’t have to imagine oppression; he’s experienced it many times over. Even so, he is too invested in upholding his cis privilege to side with Blanca as she faces blatant discrimination. And he’s rewarded for this with the approval of a white person.
I’ll be honest: I was surprised with this scene. I thought the show was going to call out cis straight white men (the usual suspect for privileged people being problematic) and cis gay white men (one of the usual suspects for marginalized people being problematic) and move on. After all, cis white men of all sexualities do benefit from many privileges, and having more privileges gives you more avenues to oppress people, whether intentional or not. But instead, Pose pointed out how anyone with privilege, even marginalized people, even people with multiple marginalizations, can oppress others to uphold their own privilege. And specifically in this case, how cis queer people (and not just the white ones) are far too comfortable perpetuating transphobia. And more personally, how I have been and continue to be far too comfortable perpetuating transphobia, even if I don’t realize it. And how we need to change.
BGLTQ people may be in the same community, but that doesn’t mean we all face the same issues. Let’s not “All Lives Matter” this. There are specific and real barriers that trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people face that cis people do not, or at least not to the same degree. These include lack of healthcare access, inadequate or nonexistent protections from employment discrimination, and a high murder rate — one in 2,600 for young black trans women in America compared to one in 12,000 for all young adults. These barriers are symptoms of a structural imbalance that cis people benefit from and continue to uphold. Drawing attention to this isn’t divisive; it’s the only way that we can achieve true equality for our entire community. It’s abhorrent that cisgender queer people would benefit from and perpetuate transphobia while reluctantly throwing in a “T” to the acronym as an afterthought.
While today’s mainstream BGLTQ movement can be notoriously cis-centric, we shouldn’t forget that the first Pride marches were in commemoration of the Stonewall riots, led by trans women of color Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. It’s no coincidence that a key turning point in the movement was catalyzed by trans women of color, yet they continue to be erased from our community. In fact, just this past year, anti-trans protesters disrupted London’s Pride march and were eventually allowed to lead the march. The fact that transphobes felt comfortable sharing harmful rhetoric at a Pride march — and were even rewarded with the honor of leading the march — is a red flag for the ways in which mainstream queer culture does not force cisgender people to interrogate their own transphobic biases.
The first step in fighting transphobia is listening to trans people. They deserve more than just a seat at the table; they helped create the table and should be leading our movement with a strong voice in any decision made. A movement that is not inclusive of the most marginalized is not a movement at all. Countless trans, non-binary, and genderqueer activists have already pointed out the transphobia in the BGLTQ community and how we can be better, but cisgender queer people just haven’t always been listening.
Sam Dylan Finch, a trans activist who blogs at “Let’s Queer Things Up,” highlights the importance of respecting and using people’s correct pronouns, writing on Everyday Feminism that “When you make the decision to not respect someone’s pronouns, what you are ultimately saying is that their personal truth is something you are more knowledgeable about than them.” Shige N. Sakurai from mypronouns.org explains that “sharing pronouns is a great way to disrupt the normalization and privilege of assumption,” so cisgender people should make it a habit to introduce ourselves with pronouns. Adrian Ballou, a genderqueer writer and activist, explains how ungendering our language “can bring us all closer to gender-based freedom.” Lourdes Ashley Hunter, the co-founder of the Trans Women of Color Collective, tells cisgender people to “Leverage your access to resources to create opportunities for our community,” whether that be access to educational resources, money, or certain professions. This list of behaviors that trans, non-binary, and genderqueer people have told cis people to do to help dismantle cisnormativity is far from exhaustive.
To my fellow cis queer people, we need to do a better job of listening to trans people and then interrogating our own actions and biases. It’s hypocritical for us to demand more than performative allyship from cis straight people and then turn around and perform the bare minimum of allyship for trans members of our community. We can’t hide behind queer identities to absolve us from the real harm that cis people create in perpetuating transphobia. It is not enough to just include the “T” when spelling out the acronym. If we aren’t actively dismantling cisnormativity, both within society and within ourselves, then we are part of the problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Immediately after accepting Harvard’s offer of admission, I spent many hours daydreaming of dorm life in historic Harvard Yard, where freshmen are housed in quaint, red-brick buildings for their first semesters. While my high school friends headed to other colleges were frantic, hoping that they would get into their first-choice dorms, I was at ease, confidently knowing that I would be living in a building in the heart of Harvard, only steps from Annenberg Hall, Widener Library, and the Science Center.
By the time my rooming assignment finally arrived, I was well-versed in the layout of Harvard Yard. I knew the names and locations of all the dorms and had an idea of the amenities in each one. Yet, despite my extensive research, I was still not prepared for the result: Pennypacker, a union dorm located outside of the Yard on Harvard Street.
There was an agonizing month between receiving my fateful rooming assignment and arriving at Harvard to see the cursed building for myself. From the information I could glean from the internet, it did not seem nearly as picturesque as Wigglesworth or as historically relevant as Massachusetts Hall. And I know I was not the only one of my union dorm peers to have these concerns. Looking back, I wish that some former Pennypacker student had a page on the internet that debunked the myth of union dorms.
So, to the next line of Harvard freshmen exiled to Hurlbut, Greenough, and especially Pennypacker, let me tell you sincerely that you are even luckier than the freshmen living in Harvard Yard.
The union dorms are not actually light-years away from civilization: By my calculations, it takes only six minutes and 30 seconds to walk from the front of Pennypacker to Annenberg. To the casual observer, this may seem like a terrible hindrance, but to the seasoned (well, I’ve only been here a month or two) union dorm resident, this walk has many advantages. Easy access to J.P. Licks, Hokkaido Santouka Ramen, and the rest of Harvard Square is ideal. Also, the union dorms are to the Lowell dining hall as Canaday is to the Berg. When you’re in a rush, Harvard University Dining Services is still only a few steps away, and rumor has it that House dining hall food tastes better.
The walk does deter us from leaving Pennypacker when we don’t have to, but this actually works to our benefit. When we become restless in our dorms, we head for the Pennypacker common room on the first floor to talk to each other instead of heading out of the building. The common room is crucial. On Monday night, it’s for comparing problem sets, and on Friday, it’s for sharing pizzas after meandering back in the wee hours of the night. The distance from the Yard forces us to focus our attention on the people in front of us, inevitably creating a sense of community.
Pennypacker is also known for its single, central staircase, which means that all one hundred residents will pass each other multiple times a day. When our problem set buddies can’t be found in the common room, we run up the stairs and knock on doors to hunt them down.
When other freshmen find out that we live in Greenough, Hurlbut, or Pennypacker, they respond with, “Where is that anyway?” or grimace with an, “Oof, that sucks.” The union dorms are the Quad of freshman housing: pitied by the outsiders, but loved by the residents. Many Pennypacker residents would agree that they couldn’t imagine living their freshman year in any other building.
Just this weekend, former residents of Pennypacker flooded back into the building during the Class of 1988’s 30th Reunion. When we emerged from our rooms to investigate, the alumni eagerly pointed out which suites they lived in and told us about the memories and friends that were made within these walls. Although it’s strange to think of the time when the Class of 2018 will be visiting Harvard as alumni, I can already see that we will have many stories to share with the future residents of our union dorm, from our own little world outside the Yard.
I smile when I catch myself saying that I’m heading “home” to Pennypacker. The union dorm I was so disappointed to receive has grown on me quite a bit. Come take a swing by on Harvard Street to see for yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Thursday marked National Coming Out Day, a holiday that commemorates both the difficulties of coming out and awareness of the BGLTQ community and its history. This year, the celebrations at the College were colored with multiple festivities. Students across campus celebrated the day with rainbow cake in dining halls, yoga, and an open mic event.
The day was also highlighted by the release of a preliminary information guide for BGLTQ-identifying individuals, the product of a joint effort between the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life and the University’s Title IX Office in an effort to disseminate resources clearly to BGLTQ students. It includes contact information for both administrative offices at the University (such as Office of Sexual Assault and Response and the Office for Diversity Inclusion and Community Partnership) as well as particular school affinity groups (such as Harvard Law School Lambda and Queer Rites Harvard Divinity School). A more comprehensive guide for BGLTQ students will be released in the spring.
We commend Harvard for making efforts to make the College a more accommodating space for BGLTQ students. Both the celebratory events held by the College and the University-wide information guide will work toward making BGLTQ students, faculty, and staff feel welcome and appreciated in our community.
While these events were organized primarily by the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, we would urge Harvard to expand these initiatives to all the other schools of the University. This may manifest itself in the form of a centralized affinity space for BGLTQ graduate students where members could interact. Such a space could also support the graduate BGLTQ community by hosting events similar to the ones debuted at the College’s National Coming Out Day celebrations. Institutionalizing festivities that celebrate days like National Coming Out Day and other BGLTQ-awareness days would further demonstrate University support for BGLTQ individuals in any and all spaces on campus.
As the College’s BGLTQ Office and Title IX Office work together to compile the new and improved information guide, we are hopeful that they incorporate information about mental health resources both at the College and throughout the rest of the University. Being BGLTQ can present its own challenges, and including this information in the guide would start an important dialogue concerning how being BGLTQ can affect students’ mental health.
The information guide should also be more widely publicized to all students, both now and again upon completion of the new guide, so that those who comb through the BGLTQ website looking for these resources or are members of the appropriate email lists are not the only ones accessing this information. All students — BGLTQ-identifying, questioning, or otherwise — should be made aware of this guide so that it can better inform their decisions and experiences as they navigate their time here at Harvard.

Professor Jill E. Abramson covered the Clarence Thomas hearings as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book on the topic with Jane Mayer. She currently teaches in the English department. Prior to Harvard, she served as the executive editor of The New York Times. Here, she talks with Fifteen Minutes about the politics of allegations, ethical journalism, and what’s changed over the past thirty years. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: When you first heard about Dr. Ford’s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, did you immediately draw a connection [to Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas]?
JA: I wanted the truth. I thought that her story sounded very credible, her vivid description of what happens, how terrified she was… just the level of detail and the fact that she was so reluctant to be identified and come forward. I thought ‘yes, I take these very seriously and the Senate is going to have to investigate this in some way.’
FM: Do you remember having a similar reaction when the Anita Hill accusations came out?
JA: Neither of these women were political figures. Neither Anita Hill nor Christine Blasey Ford. So what would their motive be, exactly, except they felt the call of citizenship to make their allegations known, because they speak directly to the suitability of a Supreme Court nominee who will have lifetime tenure?
FM: When you were covering Anita Hill, do you remember noticing more resistance among your colleagues and people you were talking to? Did people seem more reluctant to believe her [than they did Ford]?
JA: I worked at the Wall Street Journal then, in their Washington bureau. And I never polled my colleagues, but I think certainly after her testimony, most of the reporters, I would believe, believed her over Justice Thomas. Because I remember we were all surprised at the instant — I think this will happen with Kavanaugh too — the instant reaction…  The polls back in ’91 showed that more Americans believed Clarence Thomas than believed Anita Hill, but a year later that had completely flipped. And the anger of women over his confirmation just built.
FM: When you sat down to watch the hearings last week and as the day played out, did you think they were going to end the way they did?
I did. I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times that ran the day before the hearings saying that it was designed to end in a he-said-she-said stalemate. The strategy of the Republicans back during Anita Hill was that they designed the hearing to end in a he-said-she-said stalemate, where the accuser would be the lone woman accuser. That was very important. They felt back then — and I think it’s the same way now — that a second accuser would really put the nominee in danger. So the processes were both stacked against the accuser and, I think, unfair, with a predetermined outcome to confirm the nominee.
FM: As a journalist, do you think that the way the Kavanaugh hearing was covered contributed to how things turned out?
JA: I think journalists did a good job covering this. I would exempt Fox News, which was full of guest contributors who were very personally insulting to Dr. Ford. But for the most part, I think journalists did a good job. I think the Washington Post did a wonderful job with that first interview of her; it was very thorough, very fair-minded. And the New Yorker – Jane Mayer, Ronan Farrow found Deborah Ramirez, the second woman. That was very significant.
FM: I'm seeing this #himtoo backlash, and I mean, I assume that there was a similar kind of angry backlash from similar people [during Anita Hill]–
JA: But there was no Internet.
FM: Right. Do you think that social media might spur something else on the far-right side that wasn't possible during Anita Hill?
JA: Sure, on both sides. Social media is being used by activists who are outraged by the outcome to organize and get people to protest. You know, the #metoo movement was so powerful on the internet. I think in a similar way, on social media, there were a lot of women saying that Dr. Ford's allegations brought up they had a horrible high school experience, too — it really touched a nerve, and people were on Facebook and Twitter and other platforms talking about sharing their experiences too. So it will be on both sides.
FM: I'm always fascinated by the comments that people leave on thecrimson.com; it’s a lot of people who see Harvard as the enemy. And I'm wondering, as someone who has run the New York Times, and now you're teaching at Harvard–
JA: Right, I'm like a walking satire of the hated symbols of the liberal elite. Plus I’m from New York City, so.
FM: Right.
JA: You know, I guess my position is: I'm a truth-teller. And with Harvard and “veritas,” the whole mission of Harvard is to open students' eyes to the truth, and the traditions of truthfulness. And The New York Times is the gold standard of journalism, you know, look at this [holding up front page of The New York Times] flawless investigation into Trump's wealth that three reporters spent more than a year on. That's the truth! The attacks are predictable and, I think, have to be responded to.
FM: Do you think that these institutions need to be making efforts to in some way mitigate the polarization?
JA: In my seminars, I scour the applicants for any sign, I so want conservative students in my classes. And I've had some. Because sure, you want to include, you want to consider everything they have to say, and how they may look at issues and stories differently. I hope to turn them on to the importance of truth-telling and digging and investigative journalism.
FM: So you feel that there are ways that you can lead productive conversations?
JA: Yes!
FM: Having watched the country react to Anita Hill — on the micro level that you were reporting and writing, but also just over the past thirty years — what do you think is in store? Are you hopeful?
JA: I'm always hopeful. I mean, how can you go through life and not be hopeful? But I'm honestly hopeful. And I think we are seeing ideological see-sawing. We did have eight years of President Obama, and very different policies. Now we have Trump, but that's not going to last. I think his administration has done abhorrent things — to the climate and immigrants and trying to abolish healthcare — but politics goes in cycles. This will not last forever. And my suspicion post-Kavanaugh is that there are going to be a flood of women coming to the polls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School completed its capital campaign with $789 million raised, slightly exceeding its goal of $750 million, according to data provided by the school.
The school’s campaign, entitled “The World Is Waiting: The Campaign for Harvard Medicine,” was divided between four priorities: education, discovery, service, and leadership.
Discovery — which mostly entails research — brought in by far the largest tally at $496 million, school spokesperson Gina Vild wrote in an email. Education garnered the least, at $70 million. Roughly $1 million have yet to be designated to one of the four priorities.
Campaign chair Joshua Boger said the campaign drew mostly upon donors who did not attend the Medical School because the school has a relatively small number of alumni.
“Very little of the money that we raised came from alumni of Harvard Medical School. That’s not because Harvard Medical School alumni aren’t generous; there just aren’t very many of them,” he said.
Boger added that the small alumni base can make it more difficult to fundraise for education as opposed to research because people are more inclined to give to a school they attended.
“I think the place where the campaign probably had the hardest time was in some of the education facilities ideas,” he said, referring to renovating or expanding classroom spaces. “When you’re not talking principally to people who ever went to Harvard Medical School, that’s a hard sell.”
Using money from the campaign, Harvard Medical School will be able to establish 12 new professorships at the school itself, and 57 at affiliated hospitals, according to Vild. In total, just under 10,000 donors made gifts.
The school’s campaign forms one part of the University’s broader capital campaign, which brought in a record-breaking $9.6 billion, administrators announced last month. The Medical School’s Longwood neighbor, the School of Public Health, posted a $933 million total.
The Medical School publicly launched its campaign and announced its goal in 2014, after raising about $375 million in “quiet phase” cash. It passed the $750 million goal in February.
Harvard Medical School has faced difficulties making ends meet in recent years. The school has ended nine of the 10 most recent years with operating deficits, including a $44 million shortfall in the most recent year.
These budget woes prompted the school to sell its research facility at 4 Blackfan Circle. After receiving at least a dozen bids, the school sold the building to Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation for $272.5 million.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chanting through the halls of Harvard’s Office of Employee and Labor Relations, a delegation of around a dozen students and employees attempted to confront University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran over the controversial firing of former Harvard University Health Services employee Mayli Shing.
The group — comprised of undergraduates, graduate students, and members of three campus labor unions — sought to convince Curran to reinstate Shing, who was fired in February. Shing claims she was fired in retaliation after she made allegations of workplace racism and sexual harassment.
The group specifically chose to march to Curran’s office on Tuesday in light of Shing’s Wednesday hearing at the Massachusetts Division of Unemployment Assistance.
Shing began receiving unemployment benefits from the state of Massachusetts in July, according to Geoffrey Carens, a member of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers who represents Shing. Carens said Shing and her supporters are asking the University to compensate her for the five-month period between her firing and the awarding of unemployment benefits — and to rehire her.
“Going without income all that time put a very severe financial strain on Mayli and really affected her life very gravely,” Carens said.
According to her termination letter, Shing was fired because of “insubordinate conduct in repeatedly disregarding instructions and previous warnings.” The letter specifically cites an incident in which Shing arrived at work 30 minutes before her shift began, despite having been told not to do so.
Thursday’s demonstration was the latest effort in an ongoing campaign calling on the University to rehire and reimburse Shing.
Since her termination, a loose coalition of student and employee groups — including the Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, the Harvard No Layoffs Campaign, and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better — hosted four rallies to support her. Most recently, the group picketed in front of the Smith Campus Center during the inauguration of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, calling on Bacow to support Shing’s reinstatement.
On Thursday, the activists didn’t make it past Curran’s door.
When they arrived at the Labor Relations Office, a staffer informed them that Curran, along with most of the office’s personnel, was negotiating a contract with the HUCTW and could not meet with them.
After leaving a message for Curran with the staffer, the group retreated through the halls of 124 Mount Auburn St. chanting, “What do we want? Rehire Mayli! When do we want it? Now!”
Afterwards, they gathered on the front steps of the office to place calls to Curran’s office phone.
“Harvard is trying to claw back unemployment benefits that HUCTW member Mayli Shing has already received. Please drop this vindictive effort immediately and see that Mayli is rehired in a new, full-time job with a new supervisor and full back pay!,” their suggested call script read.
University representatives declined to comment.
SLAM member Saul A. Glist ’22, who participated in Thursday’s action, said he feels it is crucial that students support and advocate for employees like Mayli who “make this place run.”
“It’s really important right now, just given the culture around sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace,” Glist said. “If we’re trying to create a welcoming Harvard community, that obviously includes the workers who support it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a summer road trip from Killeen to Amarillo, Texas, Noah D. Zunker ’21 decided he wanted to take a semester off from Harvard in the fall of 2018 to work for Democrat Beto O’Rourke’s U.S. Senate campaign.
“It was my first campaign trip and we were in a small town called Paducah, Texas. It was our second day on the road. It was a super early morning — a Sunday morning — and 25 people showed up to Beto’s event, five of whom were Trump supporters and actually protested the event,” Zunker said. “For Paducah, that was a really good turnout.”
A Round Rock, Texas native and prospective Government concentrator, Zunker said he has always been passionate about politics. He had originally planned to work on O’Rourke’s campaign for the summer and return to Harvard this fall, but his trip to Paducah convinced him to stay on the campaign until Election Day.
“I fell in love with the campaign and what it stood for that day,” Zunker said, adding he felt he had to be “really convinced” to take time off from school to work on a Democratic campaign in his traditionally Republican home state.
Since May, he has been working on O’Rourke’s campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. While his job primarily consists of working in the Austin campaign office, Zunker said he regularly accompanies O’Rourke on road trips across the Lone Star State.
“On some of the more intense days you wake up at 5:30 in the morning and travel two hours to a middle-of-nowhere town and by the time you’re in bed it’s 2 a.m. because you just finished up,” he said.
Zunker is not the only Harvard undergraduate taking time off to pursue political activism. Caroline M. Cohen ’19 is working on a Kentucky congressional campaign, and Sarah S. Fellman ’18-19 is working in Pennsylvania state politics. Cohen declined to comment, while Fellman did not respond to a request for comment.
Anna L. Duffy ’19, chair of the Campaigns and Advocacy Program at the Institute of Politics, said she applauds “classmates who are willing to step away from Harvard to help make a difference in the world.”
But Ryan D. Enos, a Harvard government professor who has written on the topic, offered a different perspective on students taking time off for politics. He said such leaves of absence are sometimes driven by “opportunistic” motives, especially for those who work on campaigns outside of their home states.
“There’s something a little weird — for lack of a better term — when you think about students from a place like Harvard parachuting into different places in the world and going and representing campaigns,” Enos said.
“Every four years, all of a sudden Ohio is a really important place in the country. Well, you have all of these students who spend their time in Cambridge showing up in Ohio and trying to be part of a campaign,” he added.
Zachary D. Steigerwald Schnall ’21, who plans to take time off for the 2020 presidential race, has a more charitable take on out-of-state student campaigners.
“I want to be wherever I can make the biggest impact in 2020,” he said. “I think that anyone’s voice is as valuable as another on a campaign, particularly when a lot of the work that you do is making phone calls, knocking on doors.”
Prior to coming to Harvard, Steigerwald Schnall took a gap year in 2016 to work on the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s statewide coordinated campaign, which included Hillary Clinton’s presidential race and various statewide and congressional races.
“Though we were happy with the results in our state, we were of course unhappy with the results across the country,” he said. “So I decided on November 9, 2016 that I was going to take time off in 2020 — as much time off as I needed — to make sure that we had different outcomes nationally.”
Steigerwald Schnall, who also worked for the Ohio Democratic Party this summer, said he feels confident about his decision to take time off for the 2020 presidential campaign. He added that he is taking five courses per semester to graduate on time with the class of 2021, and that his academic advisers are helping him through the leave of absence process.
“It’s always a difficult decision to take time off, whether for political reasons or other experiences like starring in a play,” Steigerwald Schnall said. “There are always so many factors, like friendships, graduating with your incoming class, etc.”
Duffy said she supports students such as Steigerwald Schnall who decide to dedicate their full energies to campaigning.
“I encourage students who see the potential to play a part in history to explore the possibility of taking time off for the 2020 elections,” she said.
For Zunker, despite his demanding schedule, he believes his decision to take time off was the right one.
“This has literally been the experience of a lifetime,” he said of working on O’Rourke’s campaign this fall. “I’ve been on the road, and I’ve been able to meet a lot of really cool people and see a lot of Texas.’”
Zunker said his time off this fall has inspired him to run for office one day so that he can engage with other Texans on a deeper level.
“I love interacting with people and learning about people’s lives,” he said.
After Nov. 6, Zunker plans to catch up on sleep this winter and return to Harvard in the spring. Regardless of the outcome of O’Rourke’s campaign, Zunker said he hopes Texas residents will turn out to vote in future elections.
“If you show up and register to vote and you call your friends and tell them to vote, you can really multiply that effect out and become a lot bigger than you think you are,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Republicans proposed a December 2017 amendment to a congressional higher education bill that would bar universities from punishing students who join single-gender social groups, the legislation seemed explicitly targeted at Harvard — but it wasn’t quite that simple.
It was unclear at the time whether the bill, a suggested revision to the Higher Education Act, actually applied to the College. The legislation — titled the PROSPER Act — refers only to “recognized” social groups. But Harvard’s controversial sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, only penalize members of “unrecognized” single-gender social organizations.
Opponents of the sanctions have long said they hope to update the wording of the amendment to ensure it would force the University to choose between its sanctions and millions of dollars in federal funding. Now, they’re one step closer to making that happen.
Three weeks ago, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education — an advocacy group that says it aims to protect freedom of speech and freedom of association on college campuses— proposed an amendment to the PROSPER Act that would shift the bill’s wording to guarantee it endangers Harvard’s social group penalties.
The proposed amendment would prevent any “institution of higher education that receives funds” under the Higher Education Act from punishing students for joining any “constitutionally protected” group — whether or not that group is affiliated with the school.
Still, FIRE’s proposal — dubbed the “HEA Freedom of Association Amendment” — is far from implementation. A member of Congress must formally introduce the amendment before lawmakers can vote on it, according to Neal McCluskey, the director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute.
It is unclear whether any legislators plan to introduce the FIRE amendment, and none have done so to date.
The College’s sanctions, first debuted in May 2016, bar members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs, fraternities, and sororities from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, serving as the captains of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsements for certain prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes Scholarship.
Joseph Cohn, FIRE’s legislative and policy director, said his organization drafted the amendment specifically to ensure the PROSPER Act, if ultimately passed, applies to Harvard.
“This amendment would specifically prohibit [Harvard’s sanctions] because it would apply to institutions that accept federal funding which, obviously, Harvard is one,” Cohn said. “So I think that, if this amendment were adopted as written, Harvard would have to stop its plan to crackdown on single-gender organizations and the people who choose to join them.”
Contacted for comment, a Harvard spokesperson pointed to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s previous statements concerning the PROSPER Act. In multiple interviews, Khurana has said he believes the sanctions are key to achieving Harvard’s educational mission.
“People should respect a private institution’s ability to organize itself around its mission,” Khurana said in an April 27 interview.
Former University President Drew G. Faust said in a March 2018 interview that she is “distressed” by any congressional attempts to interfere with “internal University affairs.” In a later letter to Congress, she wrote that attempts by lawmakers to kill the penalties would “undermine [the] diversity of choice and experience” on campus.
Though members of FIRE wrote the amendment themselves, they received “feedback” during the drafting process from some congressional offices, according to Cohn. He said he did not remember which offices chose to offer comments.
FIRE is not the only group seeking to convince Congress to cancel the sanctions. Though roughly a dozen Harvard social groups recently vowed to abandon single-gender status, thus earning College recognition and exemption from the penalties, a handful of holdouts are staunchly campaigning against the policy.
The Cambridge Coalition — comprising all-male final clubs the Fly Club, the A.D. Club, and the Porcellian Club, along with the Harvard chapters of fraternities Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon — sent representatives to the Washington in spring 2018 to urge lawmakers to support the PROSPER Act.
Cohn presented FIRE’s amendment to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce during a Sept. 26 hearing on college students’ First Amendment rights.
It is unclear when — or if — the House of Representatives will vote on the PROSPER Act. Though the proposed legislation passed out of committee in December 2017, it has not yet been scheduled for a full vote by the House.
If lawmakers fail to pass the PROSPER Act, the fight over the future of the sanctions could move from Congress to the courthouse. Some final club affiliates have said they would consider suing Harvard, though they view legal action as a “last resort.”

Ranging from a forum on emerging technologies to aid those with disabilities, to a drone exhibition, to an “innovation playground” in Kendall Square, Boston’s HUBweek follows the philosophy that the air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.
HUBweek — a week-long “ideas festival” founded by Harvard, MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Globe — ran from Oct. 8 to Oct. 14. With 200 sessions and 38 industries represented, innovators and Boston residents engaged with events, installations, and talks on subjects ranging from art to science to technology.
The week also brought together thought leaders and political activists. Some of those included David Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting who co-founded the March for Our Lives movement; Maureen B. Dowd, a columnist for the New York Times; and Walter S. Isaacson ’74, a renowned biography author.
In a written statement, Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote that HUBweek is a platform where Boston-area innovators can come together to collaborate and display their work.
“Throughout the Greater Boston region and on Harvard’s campus, groups and individuals have long explored innovative answers to challenging problems. HUBweek provides a platform for industry leaders and young entrepreneurs to collaborate and showcase their work with peers and the public,” O’Rourke wrote.
Now in its fourth year, HUBweek drew thousands of attendees.
“We’re very pleased with the breadth of innovative content in the programs offered this year,” wrote O’Rourke. “Audiences were engaged at a wide variety of events throughout the week, with thousands of people coming from the Greater Boston area and around the world to take part.”
On campus, Nicole Mills, senior preceptor senior in Romance Languages and Literatures, and Rus Gant, a virtual reality technology specialist, offered a HUB week session in Cabot Library detailing their integration of virtual reality into the curriculum of French 11: “Beginning French II: Exploring Parisian Life and Identity.”
After students imagined themselves living in a Parisian quarter over the course of the semester, Mills hired four different Parisians from that same residential quarter to document their daily lives and diverse cultural practices within the same geographic space.
“It moves away from the clichés of culture towards a multiplicity of understanding,” Mills said.
“I really just wanted to talk about the notion of cultural immersion through VR — this idea that the ability to be able to walk in someone else’s shoes,” Mills said. “Research shows that if you can embody another person through VR, you’re more apt to show empathy towards that person.”
This was Mills’s first experience with HUBweek, and she said she regretted not being able to attend other sessions.
“I was looking online and was kind of jealous of all the things I was missing,” she said.
Other Harvard affiliates also organized events in Boston. Harvard Medical School professor Reisa A. Sperling presented on developments in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Sperling said that although there is still no cure, research is making progress because Alzheimer’s is now identifiable in the brain.
“We’re grateful to be part of a wonderful and committed community of partners who’ve created programs on a range of subjects — from how virtual reality can help language learners, to exploring new approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease,” O’Rourke wrote.

Former executive editor of the New York Times Jill E. Abramson ’76 and New Yorker investigative journalist Jane M. Mayer discussed the intersection of politics and press in an era of partisan discord at the Institute of Politics Tuesday.
In a conversation with Nicco Mele — the director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy — Abramson and Mayer reflected on their recently published essay, “The Press Has Never Been More Vital to the Success of Democracy,” as well as on their decades of experience covering both the executive branch and sexual harassment at the highest levels of the American government.
In recent weeks, Mayer has played a critical role in reporting the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, which emerged shortly before his confirmation. She and fellow New Yorker writer Ronan Farrow reported the existence of a letter from one of Kavanaugh’s high school classmates — later revealed to be Christine Blasey Ford — that detailed an allegation of sexual assault at a high school party. Mayer and Farrow later reported on similar sexual misconduct allegations brought by Deborah Ramirez, one of Kavanaugh’s classmates at Yale.
Covering sexual misconduct amongst members of the judiciary is familiar territory for both Mayer and Abramson, who currently teaches creative writing courses on journalism in the English Department. In 1994, the pair published “Strange Justice: the Selling of Clarence Thomas,” an in-depth account of the sexual harassment allegations raised against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas by Anita Hill during his confirmation hearings.
Abramson noted that there were strong parallels between the Thomas and Kavanaugh confirmation processes.
“To say it is a flashback is an understatement,” she said.
She remarked that the Senate Judiciary Committee’s decision to only have Kavanaugh and Ford testify, rather than call other witnesses, indicated to her that Ford’s allegations would be handled similarly to Hill’s.
“The strategy was to isolate a lone female accuser, to have her testify first, as Anita Hill did, and have the judge go last, as Clarence Thomas famously did,” she said. “That set up was guaranteed to end in a ‘he said, she said’ stalemate with all of those senators saying the same thing that they said in ’91.”
Mayer added that Thomas’s and Kavanaugh’s hearings were so similar that “three of the same senators” were sitting on the Senate Judiciary Committee throughout both confirmations.
Abramson also praised Ford’s courage in coming forward with her allegations, saying Ford “felt the call of citizenship.”
Later in their conversation, the 29th annual Theodore H. White Lecture on the Press and Politics, the two women reflected on the challenge of covering politics in an increasingly polarized and media-wary nation.
“Reporters have become unwilling combatants simply for trying to tell the truth,” Mayer said.
She went on to defend objective journalism from politicians who accuse the press’ coverage of being a partisan attack.
“It’s not propaganda, it’s not resistance. It’s reporting,” she said.
Mayer and Abramson also discussed the difficulties of reporting in the digital age, as reporters are challenged to capture readers’ attention in the tidal wave of information available on social media. Mayer advised young reporters struggling to capture an audience to tell a story in their writing.
“If you tell a story, you’ll ground your audience,” she said.
Abramson and Mayer delivered their remarks to a packed audience at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
“You could tell that everybody here wanted to be here and for better or for worse [we] are on a team now, a team for facts and reporting and the truth,” said Timothy C. Devine ’17, who attended the event.
Megan Gentile, a student at a local high school, said she enjoyed the event as a “budding journalist.”
“They kind of spoke about telling the truth and just emphasizing the truth in this world when everything can kind of get a little bit crazy, which I think is important to tell to journalists, especially young ones like me,” she said.
Abramson said after the event that her main piece of advice for young journalists is “to just be determined to dig out the truth, to work somewhere that values [the truth] and will give you the time to do it.”

Following the cancellation of an Undergraduate Council-led town hall about “Shopping Week,” the UC Education Committee held an “organization meeting” to help students prepare to defend the College’s embattled course registration system in a series of upcoming “listening sessions” with members of a Faculty-led committee.
Roughly 50 undergraduates gathered in Harvard Hall Tuesday evening to prepare to strategize a cohesive message to defend Shopping Week — the weeklong period during which students freely wander in and out of courses before officially enrolling — and address undergraduate concerns about its potential elimination.
“We thought that it was still important for students to realize that we stand behind them and that we want to be able to build this platform together,” said Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, chair of the Council’s Education Committee.
Amanda J. Claybaugh, dean of undergraduate education, announced Monday that, in lieu of the originally planned town hall, the College will hold three separate administrator-led events at which students can share their thoughts on Shopping Week. The events will be attended by members of a recently formed committee tasked with considering alternatives to Shopping Week.
Palaniappan said that, after the town hall’s cancellation, she thought “being able to organize ourselves as students around this topic and come to a common understanding” around how to best advocate for Shopping Week during the listening sessions was “extremely productive.”
Over the course of the hour-long meeting, students discussed concerns that would arise from replacing Shopping Week, including scheduling difficulties, an inability to explore interests, and an inconsistency with the College’s stated commitment to the “transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education.”
Students also acknowledged concerns held by administrators and graduate students, many of whom have bemoaned the uncertainty Shopping Week creates for undergraduate teaching assignments and classroom sizes.
“The Education Committee does hope to reach out to graduate students so we can better understand what their concerns are,” Palaniappan said.
She added that she thought the conversations about Shopping Week “have been taking place in bubbles” of administrators and faculty, undergraduates, and graduates, with little communication between all parties involved.
Several students expressed a desire for undergraduate input to be considered seriously, and not merely as a formality.
Cara J. Kupferman ’20, who attended the event, said she “definitely” planned to attend one of the administrator-led listening sessions.
“I was a transfer student to Harvard, and one of my favorite things about being here has been Shopping Week,” she said. “I think that it really embodies the power of a liberal arts education and has made my experience here so much more impactful and educational.”
Other students expressed a general frustration with the way student input had been considered in the process thus far.
“We deserve to have a right in what we say and how our lives are run,” Samuel M. Throm ’20 said. “We are not children that need to be controlled. That is what this Shopping Week decision feels like.”
Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, a UC Education Committee member, said the current debate was about issues broader than just Shopping Week.
“It has to do with the feeling that the student experience at Harvard cannot be something that is just prescribed to us,” she said.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke to College and Kennedy School students about the upcoming midterm elections and the Democratic agenda Tuesday, predicting significant gains for her party.
Pelosi’s remarks emphasized unity, mobilization, and transparency in government, asserting that those principles “are important to anyone who takes public service seriously in our country.”
Caroline B. Kennedy ’80, former U.S. ambassador to Japan and honorary chair of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee, introduced the discussion with Pelosi and moderator Mark D. Gearan ’78, director of the Institute of Politics.
Pelosi expressed confidence in a Democratic victory in the November midterm elections.
“If the election were today, we would win the majority,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi emphasized the importance of organizing one’s own agenda before worrying about opponents, repeating multiple times that Democrats “don’t agonize, we organize.”
The Democratic leader also praised the slate of Democratic candidates running for Congress this year.
“They know their why. They know what their vision is about America. They know their subject matter, whatever it is that drew them in: whether it’s climate, LGBTQ, women’s right to choose, gun violence, immigration,” Pelosi said. “These candidates are authentic. They know who they are, why they’re running, what they’re talking about, and how to do it.”
Pelosi also addressed plans for the Democratic agenda if her party retakes the House. According to Pelosi, Democrats plan to “rebuild our agenda by consensus,” welcoming the “revitalization” brought by new representatives.
She predicted the first bills likely proposed by a Democrat-controlled House will concern campaign finance reform and increased openness and accountability in the House. Other priorities Pelosi highlighted included lowering healthcare costs, developing climate-friendly infrastructure, protecting DACA recipients, and establishing “common sense background checks” to prevent gun violence.
Throughout the discussion, Pelosi emphasized the importance of voter mobilization and encouraged students to get involved in campaigns.
“Uncross your fingers and ring a doorbell. Take action instead of hoping that others will,” Pelosi said.
Students who attended the discussion said they were motivated to take action in this year’s midterms.
“I really liked when Nancy Pelosi tells people to uncross their fingers and ring a doorbell,” Katherine K. Roberts ’22 said. “It was a cool way to explain how to not just sit in your room and hope the election goes well but to get out and get people active.”
Attendees also highlighted Pelosi’s focus on the significant number of female Democrats running for Congress.
“In her speech, Leader Pelosi encouraged women to own their power and run for office themselves, which is a message that is empowering for all women at Harvard, regardless of political affiliation,” Olivia M. Ferdinand ’21, chair of the Women’s Initiative in Leadership at the IOP, said.
Pelosi, who will face reelection to become speaker of the House should the Democrats retake the chamber, said she was aware of potential challengers within her party.
“It’s the Democratic Party, it’s what you expect, the vitality. None of that frightens me. It’s what I anticipate, what I expect, and what I thrive on,” she said to applause. “I’ve said to my colleagues, ‘Do what you have to do. Just win, baby.’”

Columbia University announced last week that its endowment investments returned 9 percent during fiscal year 2018, making it the only school in the Ivy League to trail Harvard in endowment returns.
The Columbia Investment Management Company, which manages the New York school’s finances, announced that the gains brought its total endowment to $10.9 billion. This October marks the first full fiscal year group chief Peter Holland’s has overseen its returns.
The school’s endowment returns trail this year’s Ivy League average of 11.8 percent as well as the S&P 500, which returned 14.37 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Harvard returned 10 percent, an improvement from last year’s return of 8.1 percent, but still behind most of its peers.
In a press release, Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger noted the returns’ impact over the last decade, but he did not directly address the school’s latest fiscal year returns.
“Strong and steady investment performance across market and economic cycles is essential to sustaining our world class scholarship, teaching, research, and patient care,” Bollinger said in a written statement. “The returns achieved over the past decade and the remarkable generosity of our donors continue to help us expand student access, discover new knowledge, and advance Columbia’s groundbreaking research.”
Columbia’s statement noted part of the endowment’s growth came in part thanks to a “substantial growth in gifts,” including donations from Herbert and Florence Irving, as well as Roy Vagelo. The school’s endowment is made up of over 5000 separate funds.
N.P. Narvekar, CEO of the Harvard Management Company, previously oversaw Columbia’s endowment. During the last reporting cycle, a period in which Narvekar led Columbia’s endowment for the first part of the fiscal year, Columbia returned 13.7 percent, the third best returns in the Ivy League.
Experts said it is too early to judge Narvekar's strategy at Harvard, instead recommending that Harvard’s investment performance should be judged as Narvekar’s tenure progresses.

The kickoff is the most violent play in college football. Setting up a full sprint of the two teams toward each other, more concussions occur during these kickoffs than any other play, but the Ivy League has been working to change that.
A study released by the Journal of the American Medical Association on Oct. 1 supports the experimental Ivy League kickoff rule’s effectiveness in reducing the incidence of concussions.
The researchers, Douglas J. Wiebe, Bernadette A. D’Alonzo, Robin Harris, Margot Putukian and Carolyn Campbell-McGovern, summarized the study’s results in a research letter titled, “Association Between the Experimental Kickoff Rule and Concussion Rates in Ivy League Football.”
For the past two seasons, the division’s football teams kickoff from the 40-yard line, as opposed to the 30-yard line in previous seasons. Additionally, touchbacks can be called from anywhere behind the 25-yard line and if a touchback is called, the ball is placed at that 25-yard line rather than the 20-yard line of the years past.
The study measured the number of concussions during kickoffs in the three seasons prior to the rule change and during the two seasons following. From 2013 to 2015, the incidence of concussions on kickoffs was 10.93 for every 1000 plays. In the two years succeeding the rule’s implementation, the incidence rate decreased to 2.04 for every 1000 plays — more than a 68 percent reduction.
“I think it’s a no brainer. I just think it makes so much sense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “If you move the kickoff line up, you’re definitely going to have more touchbacks and therefore you’re going to have less high speed collisions. It’s such a no brainer that I can’t believe that it won’t eventually adopted by the NCAA.”
The rule is aimed at increasing the number of touchbacks on kickoffs, thus preventing any full scale contact on the play. In the three years prior to implementation, kickoffs resulted in touchbacks an average of 17.9 percent annually. In the 2016 and 2017 seasons, that mean increased to 48 percent.
“I think it's good, I think this is what it’s going towards,” said Harvard senior defensive tackle Richie Ryan. “I think they’ve found something that works so stick with it. Kickoff and kick return are just becoming more old style football that I don’t think is going to last much longer.”
The NCAA has since adopted portions of the rule, allowing any fair catch signaled within the 25-yard line to count as a touchback. In the past, players could only signal a touchback if there caught the ball in their own endzone.
Concussion review in the Ivy League began in 2010 with the formation of a special ad hoc committee. The committee was chaired by then-Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim and then-President David J. Skorton and was comprised of a number of coaches, administrators, consultants, team physicians and trainers.
The committee’s initial recommendations — taking effect in the 2011 season — limited the number of full contact practices, specified education athletes would receive surrounding head trauma and made the post-game review of helmet-to-helmet contact more stringent.
This committee also began to review kickoffs, noting in it’s study that while the kicks only accounted for 5.8 percent of plays, the collisions caused during the kickoffs accounted for 23.4 of concussions during games.
In 2016, the coaches of the Ancient Eight squads unanimously voted to approve a rule prohibiting full contact football practices, another effort to address concussions. Only weeks later, the National Football League acknowledged for the first time the link between CTE and playing football.
“The action taken by Ivy League leadership based on epidemiologic evidence demonstrates how targeted policy changes can reduce sport-related concussion,” the researchers wrote in the letter. “Although these results may not generalize beyond the Ivy League, they may inform the NCAA as it considers adjusting the kickoff rules in football in all collegiate conferences.”

It was the last set of races for the day, and the end of the regatta. On Mascoma Lake in western New Hampshire, the Harvard men’s sailing team was sitting in first place, with the Stanford Cardinal nipping at its heels. With the Captain Hurst Bowl on the line, each boat of the three divisions was poised to take water one last time. Unfortunately, Harvard did not sail its best in those pivotal races.
“We didn’t do well in the last set, they got us there,” said sophomore Henry Burnes, an active Crimson news editor. “[We didn’t] execute on matching up with the guys we had to beat and beating them in the race. [We needed to] do a little more boat-on-boat racing — just connecting with the other boat and ensuring that we stay ahead of them.”
Despite having to settle for second place — an impressive feat in and of itself coming from a 17 team field that consisted of many top boats — Harvard had many impressive performances throughout the event hosted by Dartmouth College. The Crimson’s division A boat, consisting of sophomore Eliot Burnes and senior Lena Episalla, finished in fourth place in the division and actually held the top spot many races during the second half of the regatta. The division B boat, sailed by Henry Burnes and senior Catherine Tang, finished in third in the division. The division C boat, captained by junior Jessica Williams and senior Nicholas Karnovsky, also snagged a fourth place finish.
But when it came down to the wire, Stanford outperformed the entire field. Both the Cardinal’s A B boat won its respective final races of the regatta, and Stanford’s B boat held the top spot in its division for a majority of the entire regatta. This boat was the true difference-maker for the Cardinal’s team, as it extended skipper Wiley Rogers’ undefeated streak on the season and finished in first place in the B division, ultimately bringing home the Captain Hurst Bowl for Stanford.
“It was an exciting end of the regatta,” said Williams, the Norfolk, Va. native. “We’re happy with the second place, but it definitely stings a little. We would have obviously preferred to get first.”
Also this weekend was the Women’s Showcase Finals, hosted by Brown University. The Crimson finished in 11th place out of 18 teams, with the A boat — sailed by senior Taylor Gavula, freshman Emma Kaneti, and sophomores Emily Wang and Emma Jakobson — snagging a 10th place finish and the B boat — led by junior Lucy Wilmot and senior Alejandra Resendiz — ending up in ninth place.
Looking back on the weekend, both Williams and Burnes saw ups and downs for Harvard. As such, the team is looking to perfect its technique as the fall season begins to wind down.
“We did a pretty good job of positioning ourselves well on the course,” Williams said. “In general, we could be better about our starts and be more consistent with our results.”
Burnes tended to agree with Williams about the importance of a solid start to a race.
“The team generally was able to have good races when we got off the line well and had good starts, and struggled a little more when we weren’t able to get good starts,” Burnes stated. “[We need to] get off the line clean and put ourselves in spots that are conducive for doing well in races.”
With all that in mind, the Harvard squad is certainly optimistic for the future. This upcoming weekend is the Showcase Finals at Saint Mary’s College — the culmination of the sailing season — to which only the top 18 teams in the country are invited. The Crimson will face some of the opponents they saw this weekend as they compete in one of the most important regattas of the season.
“It was a good weekend for the team, and we’re building up towards the Showcase Finals,” said Burnes, the Boston, Mass., native. “I think we’ve had a pretty good, building season — we started off a little shaky, and we started to get more consistent and have stronger finishes in the regattas — so we’re hoping to close out the season on a high note.”

For the second straight season, Harvard men’s basketball has been pegged as the preseason favorite to win the Ivy League. A panel of media representatives granted Harvard 12 of the possible 18 first place votes in the poll, doling out five to Penn and one to Yale. The Quakers shared the Ivy League title with the Crimson last season, winning on its home court in a 68-65 nailbiter to clinch a berth to the NCAA Tournament.
It is no surprise that the current outlook of the conference places Harvard’s squad firmly atop the Ancient Eight, as the Crimson returns a strong batch of juniors. Harvard’s Class of 2020 includes reigning Ivy League Player of the Year forward Seth Towns, All-Ivy first team forward Chris Lewis, and 2016 Rookie of the Year guard Bryce Aiken, who will be returning from an injury that sidelined him for most of last season. The junior class accounted for over 76 percent of the team’s scoring and 67 percent of the Crimson’s minutes. The rest of the returning roster combined with the juniors to return 99.4 percent of Harvard’s scoring from last season, the second most in the country.
Penn has a similarly talented duo of juniors in forward AJ Brodeur and guard Ryan Betley, two key pieces in the Quakers’ run to March Madness last season. Both were All-Ivy selections at the end of last season, with Brodeur being a unanimous selection. The clashes between the two squads will not only have familiar faces, but will also prove to be key determinants to the Ivy League crown.
Although this title is decided within regular season play, a new element was added two seasons ago in the form of a conference tournament. The relatively new four-team format keeps the end of the season exciting for most—if not all—of the Ancient Eight. Last season, seven of the eight teams in the conference were playing for a possible conference tournament bid in the final weekend of the season, ensuring that every single matchup heading into the final slate of games carried weight.
Despite this fact, the preseason poll seems to suggest a division within the Ivy League between an upper and lower half. The Crimson, receiving a leading 137 points, was ranked 15 points above Penn’s 122, who lead Yale by only 12 points. Fourth-ranked Princeton, however, received 92 points in the poll, in front of a fifth-placed Brown team that headed up the bottom half of the poll with only 64 points. Cornell and Columbia followed closely behind with 54 and 43 points, respectively, leaving Dartmouth deep into the cellar at only 21 points.
Even if parity is perceived to be relatively low for the bottom half of the league, the Ancient Eight as a whole has a bright future ahead. The conference will field similar players with an extra year of seasoning under their belts. Twelve of the top 15 scorers from last season will be suiting up again, including the entire All-Ivy first team and six of the seven players that made up last year’s second team. Like Harvard, the Ivy League boasts a talented crop of returning young standouts that are sure to make a serious impact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing on Friday in Providence, R.I., Harvard defeated Brown in five sets after conceding the first two frames. On Saturday, the Crimson travelled to New Haven, Conn., to face Yale, a game which Harvard lost in three, tightly-contested sets.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
Although the Crimson edged out Brown in blocks, digs, aces, and hitting percentage, the statistics do not tell the full story of the matchup. Dropping the first two sets against the Bears(8-9, 1-6 Ivy), Harvard (8-8, 3-4) faced an away sweep in Providence. A loss in the third set would bring the Crimson’s two game win streak, consisting of their first victories in the Ancient Eight this year, to an end.
However, Harvard was not deterred. Entering the locker room after the second set, the team collectively found a new energy, realizing that they haven’t been playing to their usual standard.
“I think it really came down to that mentality and that urgency of knowing that if we don't get this last game it could potentially really hurt our season,” senior co-captain Christina Cornelius said.“But we realized that it shouldn’t be a stressful situation. It should be more of us being excited for the comeback.”
That excitement was on display. Harvard came out of the break a different team. With its back against the wall, the Crimson held Brown to a .000 attack percentage in the third and fourth sets. As the game progressed, the scoreline began deviating greatly, as Harvard won the fourth set by 11 and the fifth by 6. To round off the match, Harvard’s play was nearly flawless, as the team recorded only one error in the fifth set.
Cornelius led the surge, contributing 18 kills throughout the game, a statistic tying her career-high. Sophomore outside hitter Mindie Mabry and junior outside hitter Grace Roberts-Burbank also contributed double digit kills in the victory. Senior libero Anna Uhr led the team in digs with 22, and senior co-captain Brooke Istvan added 15 digs to the team’s total of 88.
With this comeback victory, the Crimson evened the all-time series with the Bears, with each team now having 37 wins against the other.
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
Looking to extend its Ivy League win streak, Harvard arrived in New Haven, Conn., on Saturday to face a Yale team that only had one loss in conference play.
The first set was decided by a two-point difference in the Bulldogs’ favor. The second set beared the same result, and the Crimson found itself in the same situation as it did the night before in Providence.
However, this time, the comeback couldn’t be made. The third set was lost by the same two-point margin as the first couple of sets. With the loss came the end of Harvard’s three-game win streak.
Although the Crimson did suffer a sweep, the scoreline did not fully depict the reality of the game. Harvard showed promise in the loss against a well-prepared and talented Yale team. Ending with six more blocks than the Bulldogs’ 15, Harvard showed dominance on the defensive end. On the offensive side, the Crimson ended with a better hitting percentage (.146) than Yale. Once again, Christina Cornelius led Harvard in kills with 11. Anna Uhr led the squad in digs with 24.
Practicing ahead of the second half of their conference schedule, Harvard is working on its mental toughness to separate itself from the competition.
“What [the game] came down to was mental toughness.” senior co-captain Brooke Istvan said. “In such a tightly-contested game, the mental toughness determines who is resilient enough to come out on top.”
In five of the first seven conference games this season, Harvard played away from home. Having to travel to a different school and play in front of an opposing crowd is always a difficult task, and it was no different against Yale. The fan turnout on Saturday noticeably contributed to the Bulldogs’ will in each of the three tightly-contested sets.
“Yale had a bunch of fans and a bunch more energy because of that,” Istvan said.
And with a game in which the teams are as evenly matched as Harvard and Yale are, the energy level is crucial to having success.
“Having the home court advantage is huge,” Istvan said. “It can really carry you and help you throughout the game.”
With the second half of the Ivy League season coming up, Harvard is facing a five-match home stretch. The Crimson return to the Malkin Athletic Center this Friday, 10/19, against Dartmouth.
