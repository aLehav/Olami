HENLEY-ON-THAMES, England—When my upcoming trip to Europe came up in conversation in the days before my departure, I was asked the same question over and over again. For the record, the answer is yes. I have seen the movie “Taken.” I’ve watched and learned. Note to self: don’t get into taxis with strangers in Paris.
Dublin, Brussels, Ghent, Versailles, Paris, Amsterdam, Düsseldorf, Köln, London and Henley on Thames. 10 cities. 15 days. This is Western Europe, the abridged version.
Hours after landing at Gatwick, we arrive at our hostel, set to explore London.
Just kidding, change of plans. It’s off to Henley. London and our bags will be there when we return, we hope.
Out of the station and straight to the river we go. Casual saunter along the racecourse before the Harvard Freshman eight’s race and we immediately run into our first acquaintance of many. Customarily confused looks anticipate the realization, “Wait, I know you…”
Ten minutes later, an encounter with acquaintance number two. This run-in is intentional. The exchange leads to a just-kidding-but-seriously warning about knee-length dresses and intoxicated composure in the Stewards’ Enclosure.
The freshman boat edges out the Yale varsity lightweight eight; we celebrate by edging toward the Pimm’s kiosk. I elbow my friend, indicating a conspicuously misplaced figure wandering out of the crowd. “Is that…oh, god, it is. What on earth happened to him?” Grass-stained pants, unidentifiable substance spilling down his button-down, wrinkled blazer with a crumpled piece of fabric—a tie, supposedly—awkwardly poking out of a pocket. Acquaintance number three looked like he had been to hell and back. Only this is Henley-on-Thames—after a quick chat, we learn the next stop on his journey: a family brunch with the grandparents.
Soon, day rolls into night as a quiet town of roughly 10,000 people morphs into a haven for drunken debauchery. Pimm’s is downed by the pitcher, and those who aren’t living the glory days, are reliving those that once were.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia—“It’s just a disgrace,” said my uncle, a Canucks season ticket holder. I could tell the conversation was paining him—maybe even more than my recent move to Boston, home of the Bruins.
“Hockey is a tough game, and the Bruins won fair and square,” he continued. “Now, we fans don’t only look like sore losers, but the enduring image of Vancouver in 2011 will be that of rioting. It’s embarrassing for the city, and it’s embarrassing for us. We look like savages.”
It’s been more than a month since the Boston Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks to win the Stanley Cup, but the series is still making headlines in Canada—or rather, its aftermath is. Overshadowing the Bruins’ first Cup win since 1972 was a post-game riot in the streets of Vancouver that resulted in millions of dollars in damages and shocking images of rioters setting police cars on fire, throwing mannequins into store windows, and wrestling with police.
Though the majority of Canadians are hockey-crazed, they aren’t crazy. The police have blamed the riots on anarchists who were looking for the opportunity to create trouble. Nevertheless, civilians abetted the frenzy, plundering local businesses.
My uncle’s disappointment in his fellow citizens was echoed in all my conversations with friends and relatives in the Pacific Northwest and, judging from the response of the city government, seems to be consistent across British Columbia.
City authorities and news stations posted images and video from the riots, asking viewers to call in if they recognized any of the perpetrators. Vancouverites came out in troves to identify an arsonist here and a thief there, and they continue to do so many weeks later.
I came to Vancouver for a wedding, an event that celebrates unity and love. It struck me, when I arrived, that this summer's most prevailing image of this city is the exact opposite of that for which I had come—it’s of school-teachers stealing TVs from the Hudson Bay and of college students striking a match at the end of a Molotov cocktail.
The anarchists may have succeeded in taking advantage of frustrated and, in many cases, drunk fans in order to cause chaos in a city known for its tranquility. But in the aftermath, people like my uncle and others I spoke to, in addition to the authorities and those who called in to identify anarchists, salvaged Vancouver’s image. As a Yank, it’s not our northern neighbors ferocity on the street that I’m worried about—it’s their ferocity on the ice.

MONTEREY, Calif.—I plunge my paddle into the water with force. But instead of propelling myself forward, I seem to be developing the perfect method for entangling my paddle in the thick coat of green kelp floating just under the water’s surface. Biting my lip, I wrestle pathetically with the unwieldy piece of plastic.
This is nowhere as easy as my friends make it look. They keep pace far ahead with our intrepid guide, a spunky fifty-year-old who leads her tour with exactly the amount of sass you would expect from someone who quit her corporate job to lead kayak tours. They glide across the waves in front of me, chatting pleasantly about whatever outdoorsy types talk about while they wait for lesser humans to catch up.
When I finally pull my kayak parallel to theirs, our guide points to a dark clump in the water sixty feet away. “Now, what you see over there are sleeping sea otters! I’ll tell you something funny about them: when the male wants to mate with a female, he bites her sharply on the nose!” (For the next two weeks, I will work this fact into every possible conversation.)
We hear a loud splash followed by frantic yelping. “Oh, looks like there’s a male getting a little frisky! All the females are getting the heck out of there! Well, who can blame them? I wouldn’t want to start my morning with a nosebleed either!"
Suddenly, we are surrounded. Having overcome their fear of humans in order to seek refuge from their playground romance, frolicking otters dart in and out of the water around us. Even our guide is awed by the sight. “It’s like Whack-an-Otter!” I say to my friend, who rolls her eyes at me.
Two otters chase each other through the water. A baby drifts alongside her mother, their coats gleaming in the light. Yet another otter floats on her back, balancing a spiky sea urchin across her belly with her paws. I rest my paddle across my lap and look out at the bay that surrounds me, its surface broken every now and then by a jet of dark brown fur.

FLORENCE, Italy—It had been a long day. We had woken up at 5:30 a.m. to catch our 7:39 train to Florence, where we spent eight hours before hopping on a train to Pisa, sprinting to the Leaning Tower and back, and catching the 7:54 p.m. train back to Florence so we could catch our return train to Venice. We were exhausted.
By the time we got back to the Florence train station, we were also starving. Looking around for somewhere to eat, we were confronted with a sign pointing towards two familiar golden arches.
Normally, as a matter of principle, I refuse to eat at McDonald’s while abroad. Urban Dictionary, which defines an American tourist as an “annoyance on anyone trying to have a good holiday in another country,” points to eating McDonald’s in foreign countries as a hallmark characteristic.
In that moment in Florence, though, I couldn’t resist Mickey D’s call. “I’ve been in Europe for five weeks now; I’m not a tourist anymore,” I told myself. Thus rationalized, I succumbed. In the homeland of pasta, pizza, and gelato, I was ordering burgers—and a side of fries with that. Of course, in classic Italian style, ketchup packets cost 20 cents.
Despite my pang of guilt, my choice of some of America’s most dubious food over some of Italy’s best isn’t uncommon. The first McDonald’s opened in the heart of Rome in 1986 amidst heavy protest, and now 300-plus outlets of the American fast food staple fill Italy. Rome is checkered with signs pointing to the nearest McDonald’s. In Bologna, the golden arches sit across the street from the city center.
Despite my usual contempt for indulging in a Big Mac overseas, I have to admit that there’s something to be said for the place. Sitting with my McDonald’s bag on the train back to Venice, I gobbled down my burgers at lightning speed, inhaled my fries and, remarkably satisfied, licked my salt-enveloped hands. All I was missing now was a McFlurry. I would just have to settle for gelato when I got back to Venice.

SEATTLE, Wash.—It’s neither easy nor productive to judge people at first glance—most of the time, anyway.
A few nights ago, I was involved in coordinating Cheezburger Night at Safeco Field, one of many micro events orchestrated and conducted by the Seattle Mariners.
That’s cheezburger, as in “I can haz cheezburger,” not cheeseburger, as in the classic staple of a true American diet.
It was among the larger nerd collections I had ever seen, and that includes a number of high school quiz bowl tournaments. Lolcatz were there in the flesh at the pre-game event at the stadium. People introduced themselves as much by username as by given name.
The group was strikingly easy to spot; I have to assume that the event was the highest concentration of xkcd T-shirts outside of Randall Munroe’s living room.
Which is why I was so confused when two men in their mid-twenties, decked out in the latest Mariners gear and each double-fisting Bud Lights, showed up for the event. I was prepared to give them directions to another part of the stadium when, much to my surprise, they presented the correct ticket, and went in to join a sizeable and growing group of individuals who could name Chewbacca’s home planet (Kashyyyk, of course).
Ten minutes later, the same two men—each at least a beer down—came back to the sign-in table ready to leave. Alas, they were looking for an all-you-can-eat cheeseburger bar, or at least some discounted grub, not the largest collection of Failblog commenters in the Northwest.
From a young age, we’re all taught that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. But in this case, that’s just inaccurate.
I could have saved those two men a solid ten minutes of fruitful beer-consumption time.

TAIPEI, Taiwan—When you travel halfway around the world to learn another language, “total immersion” does not end at the classroom. Dinner must be purchased with wild gesticulations and educated guessing, rush-hour subway apologies must be murmured fluently and, most importantly, primetime dramas must be religiously followed in their rapid-fire Mandarin Chinese.
As I flipped through the channels, which alternate between talk shows with cheesy sound effects and maudlin dramas with predictable plots, the title “Full House” caught my eye: Could it be? Had Bob Saget and the Olsen twins extended their empire across the Pacific Ocean, dubbed in Chinese? Not this time. As it turns out, Korean dramas sometimes choose names identical to those of American sitcoms, and no one thinks it strange.
And so I settled in to watch “Full House,” which stars a bright-eyed, spunky girl who gets duped by her friends into traveling to China while they steal her house and belongings. In the process, she meets a suave, handsome movie star who she soon finds out is her house’s new owner. Then they grudgingly move in together—and, well, you can probably guess the ending from there. The plot was rather thin, and my elementary understanding of Mandarin meant some of the humor eluded me, but I soon found myself unwittingly captivated.
Unlike soap operas in America that are banished to daytime television, Taiwanese dramas—or in this case, translated Korean dramas that also become popular in Taiwan—are thriving. Expanding beyond the sentimental love story, “Full House” pays close attention to issues that American shows often gloss over: maintaining good relations with the in-laws, accepting criticism from others, and resisting the lure of celebrity. For three weeks, I watched every day in rapture, pondering the cultural rift manifested on my television screen.
“Full House” has ended now, but I will continue my study of Taiwanese dramas. Maybe I’m in pursuit of an excuse to veg out, or, assuredly, to navigate the path to some deeper cultural truth. Maybe both. But for now, after a long and hot day of exploring the city, I kick up my feet and flick the television on.

An investigation into Asian gangs in the area has resulted in charges being brought against three individuals related to prostitution, with one man accused of operating brothels in Cambridge and Allston.
Wei X. Chen, Yue Q. He, and Xiaohong Xue were indicted on charges of "conspiring to induce travel to engage in prostitution," the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a press release on July 12.
Chen allegedly operated three brothels in East Cambridge at 108 Second St., 185 Charles St., and 87 Gore St., as well as a brothel in Allston at 171 Everett St., according to the indictment. The brothels were staffed primarily by Asian prostitutes, according to an affadavit from an FBI agent.
If convicted of the prostitution conspiracy charges, they will spend up to five years in prison and each pay a $250,000 fine.
Chen was arrested on July 1 and has pleaded not guilty. Authorities have not been able to arrest He or Xue, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. District Court.
Chen and He were also indicted for possession and intent to distribute ecstasy. If convicted of the ecstasy charges, they will spend up to 20 years in prison and pay $1 million in fines for each count.
The arrests were the product of a multi-year investigation into organized crime in Chinatown, resulting in indictments being brought against 26 people from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Florida.
"This criminal organization is alleged to have trafficked large amounts of drugs, threatened and beat up individuals who failed to pay off large illegal debts, and moved women around the country to work in their brothels," said U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz in a statement.
Minh Cam Luong, along with nine others, was charged with running an illegal gambling business and using violence against clients who did not pay their debts.
Employees of Luong, a member of the Ping On Gang in the early '90s, allegedly frequented Chen's brothels, as did associates of John Willis, the alleged leader of a drug-trafficking conspiracy who goes by “Bac Guai John," or "White Devil John," according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

The first American to qualify for the 2012 Olympic Games was not Michael Phelps, LeBron James, or Hope Solo.
Instead, it was Alex Meyer ’10, the former Crimson swimming co-captain who earned his place in London after competing in the men’s 10-kilometer open water race at the FINA World Championships in Shanghai on Tuesday night. Meyer’s time of 1:54.33.1 was good for fourth place along with a spot in next summer’s Olympics.
Just 25 men and 25 women will be eventually selected to participate in the 10-kilometer race, set to take place in Serpentine Lake in London’s Hyde Park. By finishing in the top 10 at the World Championships, Meyer was the only American to guarantee himself a spot in the competition.
At Harvard the swimmer earned All-American status by recording the second-fastest time in school history in the 1,650 freestyle during his senior year. After graduating, Meyer began training for the open water competition, and he won a gold medal at the open water world championships in Roberval, Canada, just two months later.
After that race, Alex’s mother, Shawn, told The Crimson that her son’s goal was to represent the United States in London—an aspiration that has now been met.
The 2012 Olympics will be just the second to feature the dangerous open water event, which debuted in Beijing in 2008. The sport has been dominated by calls for safety reforms this past year, after Meyer’s friend and roommate, Fran Crippen, drowned in October at the World Cup final in the United Arab Emirates. Meyer continues to carry a photo of Crippen everywhere he competes, and told ESPN he continues to visualize racing with his former teammate to this day.
Next summer, he’ll have the chance to imagine Crippen alongside him at the event they had both dreamt of taking part in—the Olympics.

The scene in "The Social Network" was almost laughable. Cameron S. H. Winklevoss ’04 and Tyler O. H. Winklevoss ’04, dressed in suits, came to the office of then-University President Lawrence H. Summers. Summers quipped that they were there to "sell [him] a Brooks Brothers franchise." The twins complained about their idea for a social network allegedly being stolen but found themselves outsmarted and rebuffed by a none-too-pleased president.
The portrayed twins came off as jerks, but at a conference yesterday, the real Summers pushed the envelope one step further, suggesting that they were "an asshole."
“Rarely have I encountered such swagger, and I tried to respond in kind,” he said, justifying his response to the twins.
Summers made his comments during an interview at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference. During the rest of the interview, the former Harvard president discussed topics ranging from the technology industry to the national debt.
But the remarks that have had the most play were ones in which he responded to the question "So was that scene in 'The Social Network' true?"
"One of the things you learn as a college president is that if an undergraduate is wearing a tie and jacket on Thursday afternoon at 3:00, there are two possibilities," Summers said. "One is that they're looking for a job and have an interview. The other is that they are an asshole."
"This was the latter case," he said.
Apparently, the Winklevoss twins never quite lost their habit of taking things to the top, even if those at the top may not want to hear them. In May, they decided to take their ongoing legal battle with Facebook to the Supreme Court. But ultimately, they chose not to pursue the appeal.
UPDATE: In an email to University President Drew G. Faust, the Winklevoss twins tattled on Summers for his comments. Read their complaint here.
