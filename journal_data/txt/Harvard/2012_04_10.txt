After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“His aesthetic was so intense, it almost made sense that it should burn itself out,” writer and critic Lev Grossman recently remarked in The New York Times about novelist Mark Leyner’s 14-year hiatus from the world of fiction. “I always kind of imagined Leyner having finally collapsed in on himself, becoming a neutron star or a black hole.” Much like a cosmic implosion, “The Sugar Frosted Nutsack,” Leyner’s first novel since 1998, operates on a scale incomprehensibly vast—the book opens with the creation of the universe—and incredibly small, as much of the novel focuses on the life of one strange man. Luckily, Leyner puts Grossman’s premature worries to rest: In “The Sugar Frosted Nutsack,” he crafts a hilarious combination of divine creation and mundane reality.
Leyner’s epicurean gods are no ordinary deities; rather, they are a 14-million-year-old shape-shifting motley crew of “drug-addled bards” that include deities such as El Brazoi, God of Urology and Pornography; El Burbuja, God of Bubbles, Dogs, New York, and Shit; Fast-Cooking Ali, God of Woman’s Ass; José Fleischman, God of Dermatology; and perhaps most importantly, XOXO, God of Head Trauma, including Concussions, Dementia, Alcoholic Blackouts, etc. The gods descend to Earth in a bus that plays a tune similar to the Mister Softee jingle and begin their eternal meddling with the lives of mortals. Once they splinter off into melodramatic factions, inter-God relations take on the tone of a soap opera that happens to affect all of humanity.
With shout-outs to popular figures as diverse as Lloyd Blankfein, Béla Bartók, Heidi Montag, Charlie Sheen, and the Marquis de Sade, “The Sugar Frosted Nutsack” is an uproarious foray into the lightest and darkest stretches of Leyner’s self-consciously wild imagination; yet despite its hilarity, it contains a surprising amount of profundity. The novel centers about the gods’ current obsession: Ike Karton, a butcher from New Jersey, whose own epic family story—also titled “The Sugar Frosted Nutsack” (T.S.F.N.)—appears in various forms throughout the novel. But Ike’s tale is at risk, for XOXO and his immortal allies are attempting to corrupt the epic as it is handed down through generations. Thanks to Leyner’s creation of XOXO, the novel hardly forms a coherent narrative—though in a work whose subject matter is already haphazardly artistic, that does not necessarily detract from quality.
Before Leyner explores the inner story of T.S.F.N. he inspects the seeming irreconcilability of brilliant and dull godly creations. After describing the most noteworthy accomplishments of each god, he writes, “What does this wild oscillation between the sublime (e.g. the creation of musical harmony, the electromagnetic spectrum, prime numbers, the Riemann Zeta Function, etc.) and the gratuitously sadistic (e.g. giving someone a grotesquely disfiguring facial tumor) reveal to us about the Gods?” Leyner’s humor explores the oft-questioned disparity between the beautiful and the damned from a new and poignant perspective; rather than one god who creates good and evil from infinite chaos, the sharp comparisons around the world instead reflect the whims and fancies of a troop of hedonistic deities.
In a mess of lusty gods and sex-crazed humanity, the narrative of Ike’s family story is not always easy to identify. The labyrinthine nature of the tale is a result of XOXO’s devious subterfuge. “An infinitely recursive epic that subtends and engulfs everything about it (i.e. everything extrinsic to it), and that has…been subject to the impish and sometimes spiteful corruptions…of XOXO,” Leyner writes, “presents a phenomenon that’s difficult to get your mind around.” Self-aware statements like this one, which occur throughout the book and ostensibly reference both the novel itself and the story within a story, begin to imply that both sagas gain meaning not through content, but through the experience of reading. Leyner seems to encourage the reader not to give up, to look beyond the immediate confusion of the novel and to seek its deeper meaning.
The story of T.S.F.N. is cast as an epic that is inherited through oral tradition. Its playful references to mythical stories and the culture that surrounds them ends up creating, through a peculiar combination of admiration and ridicule, a larger-than-life quality for the novel itself. The most facetious of Leyner’s flirtation with historical epics is his allusions not to Greek mythology, but to James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” Leyner first ironically addresses the content of “Ulysses” with Ike’s opening monologue on his hankering for a meaty breakfast, much like Leopold Bloom’s opening musings. Later, Leyner comments on the cultish culture surrounding “Ulysses”—including Bloomsday festivals and yearly pilgrimages to Dublin that reanimate the events of Joyce’s novel—when CALLER asks REAL HUSBAND on the reality TV show The Sugar Frosted Nutsack where Ike’s first butcher shop is located, because he plans on visiting all the key sites in Ike’s life over the course of one weekend. In many ways, Leyner mocks epics by attempting to create one, from the set-up of gods meddling with mortals to references to specific epics like Ulysses.
The novel is mostly fun and entertaining; it may be easy, however, to tire of the incessant glare of culture references and grandiloquent literary gestures in the novel. Even David Foster Wallace once lambasted Leyner’s overblown desire to entertain his readers by arguing, in his essay “E Unibus Plurum: Television and U.S. Fiction,” that Leyner’s writing was “less a novel than a piece of witty, erudite, extremely high-quality prose television” that ends up ringing “oddly hollow.” But such a claim seems hardly relevant in Leyner’s latest effort, which, despite its outrageous humor, traces a vein of contemporary culture too bleakly authentic to remain void of consequence.
In fact, Wallace’s criticism highlights Leyner’s greatest accomplishment in the novel: his ability to keep the massive force of his absurd writing contained within a relatively sincere framework. At one point in the novel, a fictional Alan Greenspan concludes that T.S.F.N. has never really been about Ike Karton, but rather “about the war between XOXO and the epic itself, i.e., the war between the boldfaced and the italicized”—that is, the war between frothy punch writing and its meaningful undertone. With its impressively small radius of action and high density of characters, “The Sugar Frosted Nutsack” is indeed a black hole that sucks its reader into an endlessly entertaining world replete with boldface comedy and italicized gravity.

Depicting purely mental sequences in a predominantly visual format like that of a graphic novel is never an easy task, and Alison Bechdel sets a high bar for herself in her carefully-constructed, cerebral memoir, “Are You My Mother?” Those waiting for a follow-up to Bechdel’s bestselling graphic novel “Fun Home” will not be disappointed. However, this latest book is, rather than a strict sequel, an enlargement on the ongoing excavation of her own life. “Fun Home” delved into revelations about her father’s covert affairs with men and possible suicide as well as Bechdel’s own struggle with her sexuality. “Are You My Mother?” turns its gaze from one parent to the other. In looking at her mother, Bechdel covers both memories and the therapy that came later, biographies of family members and inspirational figures alike, and even recounts the act of creating the memoir itself. The novel, which Bechdel’s mother accurately calls a “metabook,” often obscures, rather than reveals, her intertwined narrative, a quietly heartbreaking emotional core that even Bechdel seems to realize she can’t quite articulate.
“Are You My Mother?” draws on a variety of sources to trace Bechdel’s recollections. The novel includes dream sequences, therapy sessions, various girlfriends, bedtime reading, and psychoanalytical excerpts. Sometimes she and her mother converse; at others, Bechdel just observes her putting on makeup, watching TV, or acting on stage. Bechdel’s obsessive journaling from a young age provided her with ample and accurate material for the labyrinthine storyline of “Fun Home.” In “Are You My Mother?” however, her vast resources make the narrative almost overwhelming. In “Fun Home,” Bechdel reached a kind of closure about her father’s secret life and sudden death. Yet “Are You My Mother?” provides only a glimpse into an ongoing relationship from the perspective of a daughter trying to understand its intricacies. The mother in question remains, in many ways, an enigma, impossible to properly translate into memoir.
Bechdel’s artistic style, marked by precise attention to detail, has evolved since the publication of “Fun Home.” Her meticulousness affected her work even as a child, when her mother took to transcribing her journal in order to bypass the neurotic habits that made Bechdel’s entries take hours to write. She still notoriously photographs herself as a model for every panel (something she references at one point in the story) and painstakingly researches her sets. In “Fun Home,” Bechdel added a blue-gray wash to her customary black line art, which she refined and combined with crosshatched copies of photographs, architectural layouts, maps, and other unusual imagery. In “Are You My Mother?” she layers red and gray washes and relies heavily on hand-drawn snapshots of pages from books and journals for an unusual presentation. “Fun Home” recounted a set of intimate revelations within a fairly strict frame, while “Are You My Mother?” places a series of mainly internal upheavals on pages that play, subtly, with conventional comic form and content.
For the most part, Bechdel maintains her simple, clear technique, but breaks out of her usual smoothness at moments of extreme emotion, crumpling and marring characters’ faces—especially her own. This seems partly due to her story’s confessional nature, but at times seems connected to Bechdel’s realization of her and her mother’s advancing age. Suddenly, her familiar self-portrait has a lined face. She links her book to the onset of menopause: “My clockworklike menstrual cycle skipped its very first beat the very week, in my forty-fifth year,” she writes, “that I sat down to begin writing about my mother.” Despite these new elements—the gray-black wash, the heightened portrayal of emotion, the awareness of mortality—“Are You My Mother?” is not necessarily darker than Bechdel’s debut memoir. At the same time, the book illuminates less about her relationship with her mother than the reader might hope.
There are no easy stories in “Are You My Mother?” and, despite her graceful narrative, Bechdel struggles to tell them. Every scene is rich with effort and symbolism. For example, the story starts in Bechdel’s car, where she’s deciding how to tell her mother she’s writing “Fun Home.” Suddenly, a truck swerves in front of her: it’s a Sunbeam Bread truck, the same kind that killed her father. After this near-death experience, the sequence finishes by depicting the conversation Bechdel had been planning to have with her mother. “You mean, this is something you have to do?” her mother asks bluntly, “I can’t help you. You’re on your own.” Later, once she has a finished script, Bechdel tells her mother, “I have no idea what you went through.” She replies, “No, you don’t. I just can’t imagine how you’re going to draw it all.” Bechdel seems, at times, to encounter more roadblocks than breakthroughs, but doesn’t shy away from portraying either.
Bechdel perseveres in transferring her story in print, first with “Fun Home” and again with “Are You My Mother?” She recounts, again and again with terrible accuracy, memories of her mother interchanged with scenes with her current therapist, girlfriend, or psychoanalyst. We’re privy not only to Bechdel’s memories but to her efforts to understand what they mean, using a complex vocabulary of psychological terms. We see her, a daughter, a sister, a lover, a patient, an author, and more, reflected and distorted through efforts to put her family on paper. Though Bechdel ends the novel with a resolution, nothing has truly been decided. She bravely reveals years of journaling, therapy, and conversations, but Bechdel’s relationship with her mother, and her understanding of that relationship, is still evolving. “Are You My Mother?” seeks to encompass a complex, personal set of memories and interpretations, and, in doing so, quietly chronicles the difficulties of sketching a lifetime.

Dreadlocks, Stratocasters, and massive arrays of effects pedals were all on display at the Berklee College of Music’s annual Guitar Night: Rock and Pop concert. Produced by Berklee professors Mike Idhe and Jon Finn, the event boasted 10 guitarists from the college’s guitar program, most of whom were accompanied by backing bands. The featured players, who differed in everything from class year to musical style, performed in a relaxed atmosphere created by Finn and Idhe’s banter and an enthusiastic audience.
“I felt like everyone was really comfortable, and that empowered everyone to play comfortably,” said Michael C. Mattice II, one of the guitarists featured in the showcase.
Before the concert, Finn and Idhe said that they initially received 50 or 60 applications from which they picked the 10 guitarists. Samuel H. Harchik’s group was the first to perform, with an original song entitled “Paradigm Rain.” The song started out with a rush of frenetic shredding, then quickly progressed through a variety of sections, shifting from elaborate hard rock to something that sounded like extraterrestrial surf rock. At times, Harchik would press his back against bassist Shareef Addo’s as the two of them played solos. “Wow. That’s a whole lot of notes,” Finn said jokingly after the song concluded. “Although I’m pretty sure Sam didn’t play F sharp that whole time,” he added.
Harchik, a student at Berklee, was the youngest performer in the concert. Having seen one of his friends play the showcase last year, Harchik said he was proud of appearing at Guitar Night at such an early age. “Getting to do this so quickly was just the most insane thing,” he said. “This is the greatest show I’ve ever been a part of.”
The guitarists’ performances drew on a multitude of different styles. Harchik’s taste in music, he says, tends towards progressive metal bands such as Liquid Tension Experiment and Dream Theater, the latter of which formed at Berklee in the 1980s. Others, however, took inspiration from outside of rock and roll and Western music. “I listen to everything, from...ragas to Brahms. I’ve been listening to a lot of meditative ragas lately,” Mattice said, referring to a form of Indian classical music in which a solo performer improvises around a set of notes “But also metal,” Mattice added.
Mattice, who favored a brassier tone than the other guitarists, excitedly adjusted effects pedals to create thundering bursts of sound during his performance. Occasionally, he would swing his body in time with the rhythm, his dreadlocks twisting around his head. The lone solo performer, Julien Osty, worked in a more experimental mode. By manipulating his volume knob, he was able to create undulating waves of sound occasionally accompanied by gentle feedback. Osty had a playful stage presence; he frequently pretended to talk to his guitar. In the interludes between acts, YouTube videos such as the minor viral hit “Shit Guitarists Say” were projected onto the stage.
Among the audience members were parents, friends of the musicians, and even some potential applicants to Berklee. Current Berklee students at the event spoke favorably of previous showcases. “I’m looking forward to seeing everything,” first semester student Jeremy S. Desous said. “Last time they had everything from jazz to R&B, and I enjoyed it all.” Others were there to support friends, like Berklee freshman Tessa J. Kaslewicz, who came out to see Harchik.
Though entire bands performed for much of the showcase, in the end the audience responded most strongly to the individual guitarists. When the Spliffsters covered Led Zeppelin’s “The Ocean,” vocalist Dave Vives came out on stage dressed in a massive fur coat and pranced around constantly. He eventually discarded the coat, danced around without a shirt, and, later, tried to get the audience to sing along. But it was only when guitarist Sebastian Fernandez launched into his solo that the crowd erupted into applause.
Guitar Night was a platform for Berklee guitarists to show off their musical skills and to achieve temporary stardom as rockstars on their own campus.

Listening to Lotus Plaza’s new record, “Spooky Action at a Distance,” is like looking at a picture that has been put through a vintage Instagram filter on your pretentious friend’s Facebook. Sure, it’s pretty in that grainy and faded way that screams timelessness and authenticity, but does it reflect skilled photography? We associate graininess with authenticity because we automatically project authenticity on the past, and since photos inevitably fade with time, our only images of the past are grainy and faded. There’s nothing inherently authenticating about these visual qualities: behind the Instagram filter still stand boring, inauthentic people posing apathetically for badly composed photographs.
Similarly, behind all the layers of electronic fuzz and distorted guitars on Lotus Plaza’s new album lie dull songwriting and an unskilled, unadventurous musician who consistently confuses loudness with complexity. It may be a pretty album from time to time, but does it reflect skilled musicianship?
Lotus Plaza is the solo project of the Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, who must have inherited an inability to think up good names from his parents. Though indie band names these days typically range from alienating (Fucked Up) to exasperating (Animal Collective), Lotus Plaza reaches a new level of nominal atrocity. What is a “lotus plaza?” I’m guessing that Pundt took his initials, thought of the two most quote-unquote poetic words starting with these letters, and mashed them into a band name regardless of whether or not they cohered. News flash: they don’t.
After a throwaway ambient track, “Spooky Action” opens with its most compelling cut, “Strangers.” A soaring guitar vamp rides a sixteenth-note snare pattern from the outset, as Pundt’s disaffected croak tracks our maiden voyage: “You’re on your own / There’s no one else.” The opening of this track is an epic pinnacle of indie guitar rock, reminiscent of Deerhunter at its most expansive. But by the time we’ve reached the two-and-a-half minute mark, Pundt has repeated the same verse-chorus structure three times with little variation. As if he has tired of his own lack of creativity, Pundt gradually decelerates the tune’s tempo, ending in a deathly crawl. The heights of the first few minutes are never again reached on the album.
Instead, we get tunes like “Dusty Rhodes.” Here, a strolling tempo is repeatedly robbed of momentum by lazy acoustic guitar breaks. Like a teenager who just picked up his first guitar, Pundt seems convinced that a reductive, two-chord progression is something that everyone wants to hear ad nauseum. Hearing “Dusty Rhodes” next to the previous track, “Out of Touch,” deepens the monotony of Pundt’s theme-craft. A nearly identical melodic turn in each has us yearning for some innovation by the album’s midpoint.
One of Pundt’s biggest problems as a songwriter is his inability to adorn his songs with variations. As in “Strangers,” it’s as if Pundt were so enamored by his chord changes that he forgot that things happen in good songs. The album distinctly lacks bridges or solos: most tunes conclude with a lengthy repetition of the chord structure accompanied by growing fuzz or illegible noise. “Jet Out of the Tundra,” for instance, which begins with a moving groove that seems to pull us toward unknown horizons, ends in a mess of clashing layers and indistinct noise. As much as Pundt wants us to accept it as such, this is not development; it’s only volume.
Like the words “lotus plaza,” most of Pundt’s lyrics sound like he thought about them for the entirety of three seconds. Most songs revolve around the gaudily romantic theme of escape, whether from the ground in “Out of Touch” (“Wave goodbye and fly away”), the world in “Monoliths” (“Somewhere outside / And I wish I could be there”), or his body in “White Galactic One” (“Dancing ‘round my head / Floating ‘round my head). This already well tread territory is exacerbated by the repetition of trite, disconnected phrases that function only as lyrical placeholders. “I know / I know / I know,” he insists in “Strangers,” which is an odd refrain in a song ostensibly about people one doesn’t know. Fortunately, Pundt seems to recognize the weakness of his lyrics, as he frequently hides them behind filters and pea-soup reverb.
There’s nothing spooky about “Spooky Action at a Distance” just like there’s nothing spooky about artificially faded photos. There’s only fabricated distance: pull out the binoculars and Lockett Pundt is just another mediocre guitarist who doesn’t know how to write songs.

Alabama Shakes faces a truly daunting challenge—to be as great as its fans believe it to be. When the blues-rock band released its self-titled EP in 2011, which included the simmering track “You Ain’t Alone,” MTV named the group one of its “11 Artists to Watch in 2012.” Hundreds of thousands complied, forming a cloud of near-frantic hype around the release of the band’s first full album, “Boys & Girls.”
Now, the storm is here. “Boys & Girls” has all the strength of a tornado—it is a gale-force attack comprised of 11 deeply emotional tracks that are at once revelatory and deeply familiar. The band’s music sparks with humor and explodes into bristling rage without ever losing the deep thrum of heart rending, bluesy warmth that marks Alabama Shakes as a powerful, daring band.
Brittany Howard, guitarist and lead singer, is the obvious powerhouse behind “Boys & Girls.” Although her dynamic voice can rival that of anyone in the music industry, Howard refuses to fall back on pure force alone. Her vocals are subtle and varied for the greater part of the album. On the album’s sweeter love songs, Howard blends speech and melody into shimmering warbles that are poignant but not saccharine.
The first tracks on the album are dynamos in their own right—“I Found You” and “Rise to the Sun,” are especially moving. Howard and her bandmates seem to restrain themselves on these early tracks with controlled hooks and melodies. However, this early constraint does not detract from the songs’ beauty; it highlights the progression toward the intensity of the rest of the album.
“Goin’ to the Party” serves as the juncture between the two halves. Situated between the tender “You Ain’t Alone” and the crashing “Heartbreaker,” “Party” is understated and bare. On the track, Howard never strays from her lilting, sugared sing-speech, and the instrumentation is stripped down to fragmented plucks of bass and guitar. Clocking in at under two minutes, “Party” seems to be the deep breath before Alabama Shakes explodes.
What follows is a series of songs in which the instrumentation drives forward and riffs on Howard’s scorching vocals in ways that slams into the listener’s ear with enough force to scramble the brain and burst out on the far side of the head. “Be Mine” begins unassumingly enough, but by the end of the song it seems anything but as Howard repeats over and over, “So be mine” in a rising build that dovetails with a lively piano riff. She then breaks into frantic screams of “Be my baby” that span her entire register. Guitarist Heath Fogg and Bassist Zac Cockrell match Howard step for step, injecting the songs with sharp, bluesy riffs and following her with twangy loyalty through the mania that is their second-act eruption.
The last white-hot track, “On Your Way,” is the crowning achievement of the album. A deep bass strum lays the foundation for Howard’s high croons. The hymnal delicacy of the song’s introduction is broken by a scratchy, rising guitar riff that launches into a sprawling blues-rock yelp. The song builds and releases several times, and at one point, it pauses completely for several seconds—just long enough to create a vacuum that Howard then gloriously fills with her raw voice as she leads to the jaw-dropping finale. In the final moment of the album, Howard offers a few simple words. “It was just me / Just little ‘ol me,” she confesses softly, an incredible understatement of Howard’s titanic vocal abilities. Immediately after, the rest of the band refutes her modesty with a magnificent, crashing wave of sound. These few seconds capture the essence of a breathtaking album that is equal parts force and longing.

M. Ward sounds very drowsy on his latest release, “A Wasteland Companion.” His words are murmured and slurred together, and he frequently misses the exact pitch or beat it seems he is supposed to land on. This vocal laziness, along with tired lyrics and minimal production, gives the impression that Ward did not work very hard on the album. Maybe he deserves a rest—he’s been exceedingly busy recently, as “A Wasteland Companion” will be his seventh release in the past four years in a tally that includes albums from side projects She & Him and the Monsters of Folk. But no matter the cause, “A Wasteland Companion” is a listless effort that is more likely to put listeners to sleep than become a sleeper hit.
Ward has been writing sleepy, contemplative pop since the early 2000s. His career got a jolt when he teamed up with actress Zooey Deschanel to form the duo She & Him, which garnered much critical and commercial success. On “A Wasteland Companion,” Ward shows that he sorely needs Deschanel’s charm and charisma to complement his delicate somberness. Deschanel shows up to inject a bit of life into the fourth track, “Sweetheart,” but her appearance only serves to highlight Ward’s faults. Deschanel’s voice is relaxed and bright, layered in waves of soaring harmony. Ward, in contrast, shows strain at the top of the register, and he muffs his notes at the bottom when singing “I love you.” It doesn’t help that Ward sings his verse three times, all with the same inane lyrics: “You have a sweet heart, sweetheart, you have a nice smile, baby / You drove me crazy / Down lover’s lane.”
The lyrics are a continuing problem throughout. Given that many prominent singer-songwriters, like Stephin Merritt of The Magnetic Fields or Andrew Bird, rely heavily on wit or poetic insight, it is shocking to hear how amateur Ward’s lyrics are. “If you say, ‘how’re you doing?’ / She’ll say, ‘I’m doing well,’” Ward sings when trying to provide evidence about why his girl is primitive on “Primitive Girl.” On “Clean Slate,” Ward indulges in vague, idealistic optimism: “You only have to wait a little while / Before you find the truth.”
Ward’s shoddy lyricism isn’t helped by his thin instrumentation. The stripped-down piano and guitar accompaniments force Ward’s pedestrian vocals and lyrics into the spotlight with no place to hide. “There’s a Key” features Ward finger picking on three simple chords for three minutes while he spouts poetic gibberish about the ocean. His soft acoustic guitar wanderings toward the end of the song sound aimless rather than essential to the song’s development. This lack of movement, combined with the sluggish and forgettable melody, make “There’s a Key” the worst in whole run of quiet and emotionless guitar songs at the back end of the album.
Ward has always been characterized by a sense of aloofness; in fact, he has intrigued many listeners with his disengaged persona. On “A Wasteland Companion,” this exaggerated cool falls flat. Ward’s emotional palette comes across as, in his own words, a “clean slate.” “Watch the Show” tells the tale of a disillusioned, neglected member of modern society plotting revenge on his oppressors. But nothing about the song, from the plodding guitar fuzz to Ward’s quiet murmurs, shows any trace of passion or danger. And on “Pure Joy,” Ward doesn’t come close to exhibiting the sentiment of the song’s title.
The best song on the album, “Wild Goose,” shows the intricacy that Ward is capable of. His gorgeous, varied guitar picking is supported by strings and echoing piano melodies. Over the top, a chorus of M. Wards sing in whispery harmony. The guitar lines, harmonizations, and finely tuned production of “Wild Goose” surely required much effort by Ward and his producers, and it is a shame that the rest of the album wasn’t cared for so attentively. But if Ward did run out of creative juice while recording this album, it’s understandable. M. Ward sounds tired, and for the sake of everyone, let’s hope that he gets some golden slumber as soon as possible.

Monstrous Doubles
April 13-15, 7:30 p.m.,
April 20-21, 10:30 p.m.
The Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13,
Daniel J. Giles ’13,
Mariel N. Pettee ’14
Produced by Anne E. M. McGrath ’13
If sometimes the scariest part of a horror story is how it’s presented, then “Monstrous Doubles” promises to be a terrifying show indeed. It is an event featuring “The House of Shadows”—a play written and directed by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts writer—and   “[ ]’s Monster,” a dance-theater collaboration between directors Daniel J. Giles ’13 and Mariel N. Petee ’14.
Although both pieces are polished, “The House of Shadows is by no means a finished product. “The idea of the evening is we have a complete play, but it’s still evolving and it’s still not finished. I think it’s exciting to have two plays which are trying something new out....The idea is about bringing a playwright, a director, and a choreographer together and seeing what we can do,” he says. From the beginning, the cast helped out in the creative process. Taking Hans Christian Anderson’s “The Shadow” as inspiration, McTaggart and cast members Bryan D. Kauder ’14 and Peter K. Bestoso ’14 took turns hashing out the kind of story they wanted to tell. Only after these preliminary workshops did McTaggart sit down and write the working script for “The House of Shadows.”
In “[ ]’s Monster”—an adaptation of Mary Shelley’s classic novel “Frankenstein”—Giles and Petee combine dance with dialogue in their newly devised work. “I think Dan and Mariel make the dancing component and the acting component one and the same. They’re sort of inseparable,” says cast member Emily B. Hyman ’13. Each character enacts their role in a unique dance style that emphasizes non-verbal communication. “Sometimes it’s a block of dance and then a block of acting, but a lot of the time it’s more mixed than that,” says Anna A. Hagen ’15, who is playing a character named []. “Sometimes I’m doing something really different with my words than with my body, and that’s an interesting contradiction that complicates everything.”
Both productions imbue their scripts with an original vision. By pushing theatrical boundaries, “Monstrous Doubles” aims to take traditional horror stories and experiment with their structures, creating something brand new in the process.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 19
An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of one of the directors of “Monstrous Doubles.” It is Mariel N. Pettee ’14.

Cain & Cain
April 13-15, 8:00 p.m.,
April 19-21, 8:00 p.m.
The Loeb Ex
Directed by Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13
Produced by  Christopher M. Lehman ‘13
Only a really dark play could have a name like “Cain and Cain.” This new work—which revolves around the dynamics between a mother and her two sons Michael and Chad—features fratricide, incest, dead dogs, and extended conversations about cabbages.  Writer and director Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13 is the first to call his work weird. “At its heart, despite the weirdness, this is a play about relationships, and sometimes the dogs just have to die for that,” he says.
“Cain and Cain” promises to be inventive not only in its subject matter, but also in its staging. “The audience is actually in the center, and the set goes around them,” Nee-Vogelman says. “The set really lends itself to creating this place that feels like this is the only place in the world. A lot of this play is about people trying to escape from the situations they’re in and finding themselves unable to leave and unable to change anything.”
The production aims to create this same sense of confinement in the audience. “I think the audience will feel trapped in the story in a good way, but in a disconcerting way as well,” says Ben J. Lorenz ’14, who plays Michael. The enclosed quality of the narrative extends to the staging, as the set surrounds the audience and will effectively prevent anyone from walking out. “No one’s fucking leaving,” says Nee-Vogelman.
There will be no scene breaks or set changes in “Cain and Cain.” The circular staging allows multiple backdrops to exist simultaneously in different areas of the theater and for the actors to literally walk from scene to scene without going backstage. The cast seems excited about tackling the material despite the constant energy required of them to be in character through the full duration of the play. “I think it’s really helpful, I think being onstage the whole time keeps you focused,” says Darcy C. Donelan ’14, who plays the mother.
“Cain and Cain” will be odd and experimental and perhaps a little overwhelming. “I want to make a show and have people come out and say, ‘Huh,’ and maybe that’s enough,” says Nee-Vogelman.

Hart Crane
April 20-22, 8:00 p.m., 26-27, 8:00 p.m.
The Loeb Mainstage
Directed by Devon H. Dunn ’12
Produced by Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12,
Madeleine F. Bersin ’14
A student-written opera about the eponymous American poet, “Hart Crane,” tells the life story of an artist who is regarded as one of the most brilliant of his generation. Matthew A. Aucoin ’12—who wrote both the score and the libretto—has been writing operas for as long as he can remember. He finds the story of Hart Crane uniquely engaging. “What I want to present in this piece is the story of a human being who wanted to do something impossible. He wanted to invent poetry as a whole new language for…art in America,” Aucoin says.
Set in 1920s New York City, “Hart Crane” chronicles Crane’s trials and triumphs as he struggles not only to create a unique form of poetry but also to come to terms with his own homosexuality. Drawing inspiration from the works of T. S. Eliot, Crane rebelliously set out to shake the literary world through his highly stylized, difficult poetry. With his most ambitious work, “The Bridge,” Crane brought a new sincerity to modern American poetry.
According to Aucoin, opera provides a unique medium through which Crane’s life story can be poignantly conveyed. “Opera is the right medium to do this because it shows so many different registers. You can show a boring fight between two lovers just as effectively as a fantasia on the poetic process,” he says. Having loved opera since childhood, director Devon H. Dunn ’12 has found it exciting to put together an operatic work, especially one of this caliber. “The Mainstage is such a big, beautiful space, which works really well for [opera], which is so grand,” she says.
“Hart Crane,” will portray a trying tale of self-discovery and the power of art. New works such as this one emphasize the fact that opera is very much a vibrant art form. “A big meta-theatrical takeaway is that opera is not dead,” says Dunn. Through poetry and music “Hart Crane” explores the life of one of America’s most important poets.

One of my earliest memories is of sitting on my dad’s lap in the sun-dappled living room of our first house. The chair we sat in then rests worn in my room now, but even 15 years ago it still creaked like an old family relic. As we rocked, my dad sang “Summertime Blues” by The Who and I fell asleep peacefully to the dulcet tones incongruously paired with lyrics like, “Well, I’m gonna raise a fuss / I’m gonna raise a holler.” The first cassette I bought was by Bob Dylan, but the first band I fell completely in love with was The Who. Every morning, on the way to school, my mom and I would listen to Oldies 103.3 FM and my favorites were the Motown songs.
We never fought about music. My brother—who gave me fodder for an endless series of lovelorn mixtapes in middle school and the band names to make me look cool on Facebook in high school—got me listening to alternative music starting in seventh grade, and my drives to school changed for the next few years. My mom endured my obsessive love for Everclear’s “So Much for the Afterglow,” and as the school bus phased out short morning drives and introduced me to the majestic appeal of early mornings spent channeling the heartache and rage of others through my earbuds, I stopped listening to Motown.
In junior year of high school this changed in a matter of three minutes and 48 seconds. One day, as I waited for the bus in my mom’s car, I tired of the CD in the drive. When my rummaging turned up no sufficient alternatives, I turned on the radio and cycled, thanks to a well toned habit, to Oldies 103.3. The first song I heard was “Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)” by The Temptations. Those few minutes were the closest I’ve ever gotten to having a Proustian moment.
The song begins with Eddie Willis’ solo guitar sliding placidly with a light tremolo effect. With each surge of the guitar and Bob Babbitt’s bemused bass, the snare drum hisses almost unintentionally. The song is undeniably recorded live, which is almost hard to believe because it is so perfectly played. It feels magically calm, peacefully together. When The Temptations strike their first three-part harmony, Babbitt locks into a warm bassline, and the horns strike a chord and fade. Otis Williams sings with soft-toned reverence as he sets the scene: “Each day through my window / I watch her as she passes by.” Williams tells of his joy at loving this distant woman: “Soon we’ll be married / And raise a family.” At each chorus, he reminds himself that she doesn’t know he exists: “It was just my imagination / Running away with me;” every chorus a resignation to the verse’s dreamy hope.
When The Temptations recorded the song, they knew they were coming to the end of something. In the section of the song when the narrator’s self-deceit gives, Paul Williams moans, “Every night on my knees I pray.” At the time, the pain of Williams’ sickle-cell anemia had driven him to alcoholism, and the group knew that soon they’d have to let him go. His voice is pure emotion on those notes, strained through a growing husk. Two years later, he’d take his own life with a shotgun. Eddie Kendricks felt he was constrained by the group and was moving towards a solo career. When Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong gave the group the song, The Temptations all knew it might well be their last.
It feels like a memory the first time you hear it. Dreamlike and faded, it ebbs from even the most compressed MP3 as if it’s worn with a thousand late-night spins under a dulling needle. The guitar tone is muted and distant like the orchestra’s French horn, throbbing and mumbling soothingly. Williams sings of loving a girl who will never know him, but the song is somehow not heartbroken. It’s as if, in producing this rapture, the love, while unrequited, is not unfulfilled. It’s almost humorous to hear the members of the group finish each other’s sentences as if they were all the same lovelorn dreamer, mournfully packed behind a windowpane and watching their love go by.
But it isn’t funny, or sad, or pained—it’s joyful. The song is a peaceful space where such love can flourish, and The Temptations sound as if they’re dreaming together, providing the harmonies that undergird each other’s reveries. Kendricks had to record his vocals separately because he was so mad at Williams that they couldn’t be around one another anymore, but on the record their overdubbed voices harmonize the way they did when they’d just begun. The song is bittersweet because their dreams of stardom are dissipating, but joyful because they’ve dreamed nonetheless.

A small metal table sat center stage, nearly buckling under the weight of dozens of bottles of booze. This bar served as the centerpiece for the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s new production of Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night.” As the play descended into a giddy mash-up of gender-bending chaos and romantic comedy, the irreverent cast of characters drained the bottles, and their spent cans rolled around on the stage with all the illogical direction that marked the revelers who empty them. At times, this dedication to playing up the bacchanalian nature of the Bard’s original text caused the play to sag beneath the weight of its own affected whimsy. However, the strength of the cast, all of whom exhibit remarkable comedic timing, managed to overcome the production’s occasional self-indulgence. “Twelfth Night”—which ran in the Loeb Ex from April 5 to April 7 and was directed by Susanna B. Wolk ’14—was a saucy staging of an already flippant play. The cast and crew brought Shakespeare’s bawdy gem into the modern era with ease and hilarity.
The play follows several tangled love triangles from their creation to their eventual romantic resolution with only the most ridiculous characters left single by the end of the production. Viola (Olivia L. Ball ’14) and her twin brother Sebastian (Matt J. Bialo ’15) unwittingly run circles around their respective love interests, Duke Orsino (Josh G. Wilson ’13) and the Princess Olivia (Anjali R. Itkowitz ’13, a Crimson arts writer). Viola decides to cross-dress as a way of getting closer to her prince and in the process wins Olivia’s heart.
Wolk seamlessly integrated liberal drug and alcohol use into Shakespeare’s text.  She played with the original wording in interesting ways—when the script told the characters to “hold their peace,” they held aloft their pipes instead. No one called for swords to be drawn without thrusting their crotch into the air and gesturing wildly at their genitals, and every convoluted Shakespearean insult was accompanied with eye-rolls and raised middle fingers. Dummy weed was passed around in sandwich baggies in many scenes, and the cast, especially those playing characters who were most deeply under the influence, did a magnificent job of slurring and stammering their lines to hilarious effect.
Ball was magnetic as her male alter ego Cesario—she strutted across the stage, leading with her sock-padded crotch, and in moments of great emotion and confusion her eyes always managed to find their way back to the audience with a conspiratorial glitter. For example, in one scene Cesario tries to fend off Princess Olivia’s wild affections. She tried to escape, but in the course of the action she still found the time to send the audience an impish wink that highlighted the farcical nature of what was going on.
The gang of pranksters, Maria (Madeleine F. Bersin ’14), Sir Toby Belch (Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, a Crimson arts comper), Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Aaron S. Graham-Horowitz ’15), Fabian (Nancyrose Houston ’15), and their luckless target, Malvolio (Ari D. Brenner ’14) ultimately stole the show. Hilgartner and Bersin’s every movement laid bare their characters’ complete moral bankruptcy, while Brenner’s portrayal of a party-pooper-turned-hopeless-romantic was hilarious to the point of tears. In this absurd gaggle, however, it was Graham-Horowitz who shone most brightly. His stage presence was a consistent highlight of the show, and he played the bumbling Aguecheek with infectious absurdity. There were several moments in which Aguecheek tried to show off his dancing chops. What he saw as irresistibly suave was actually the bizarre lovechild of the Robot and the Funky Chicken, a dance which Graham-Horowitz preformed to hilarious effect.
With giddy wickedness, drunken belligerence, and romantic intrigue running rampant, there were a few moments when the play boiled over past the point of artistic subtlety and into the realm of pure spectacle. For example, when the revelers managed to convince the authorities to institutionalize Malvolio, the glee with which they persecuted him was overblown and seemed incongruous, even for this band of merrymakers. However, for most of the play, the impressive cast managed to reign in the madness; as a result, their characters remained genuinely intriguing and sympathetic. The cast and crew of “Twelfth Night” worked hard without taking themselves too seriously, and the result was an inventive staging of Shakespeare’s classic comedy.

“Damn it, I’m screwed! People are picking up on my shit,” says Julia Easterlin as she sits in a cafe on Newbury Street, gingerly spreading cream cheese on a bagel. Her sarcastic cause of concern is other musicians using vocal looping—a musical technique that Easterlin has explored and mastered over the past few years. Easterlin sounds conflicted when talking about artists like Andrew Bird or tUnE-yArDs who have recently used the technique. “There’s a pathetic part of me that’s threatened by it, but at the same time I have to keep reminding myself, ‘No, this is good.’”
Easterlin, a graduate from the Berklee College of Music, has had a lot of good things going for her recently. The Boston-based 23-year-old singer-songwriter has received prominent attention due to her innovative, loop-driven compositions and exuberant voice. In the past year she’s performed at large-scale music festivals including SXSW, CMJ Music Marathon, and Lollapalooza. She will release a new EP soon, and a full length album is in the works. These two projects will only contribute to what Easterlin has called a “crazy year.”
However experimental and technologydriven Easterlin may be now, her musical beginnings were in traditional folk and jazz. “I found my mom’s acoustic guitar under her bed. I was thirteen,” she said nostalgically. “My mom listened to a lot of Joni Mitchell and Indigo Girls, so I was like, ‘Yeah, that’s what I’m going to do!’” She performed mainly as a jazz vocalist in high school, traveling around the country for competitions. “Once I got to Berklee I had some realization that that just wasn’t what I wanted to do,” Easterlin said. “I really started finding my own voice.”
Easterlin’s musical style is driven by loops. During a live show, she will sing a vocal pattern into the microphone that will be looped through a speaker and then overlays a harmony or rhythmic complement on top. She employs traditionally sung melodies along with percussive sounds ranging from beatboxing to beating on her chest as she exhales. Easterlin then coalesces all of these parts into layered soundscapes. On her rendition of “There There,” a Radiohead cover that appeared on Berklee’s Heavy Rotation Records album, she recreates the gloomy atmosphere of the original by using different intonations of her voice; blunt “doos” form the bassline, and shimmering “oo-wee-oos” fill out a droning backdrop. Above all of her percussive experimentation, Easterlin sings the melody with an expressive yearning.
Her inclusion in the Heavy Rotation Records show came at a particularly trying time, and her rendition of the Pixies’ “Break My Body” resulted out of, in her words, “emotional necessity.” Her original plans to sing in the project’s showcase last February were jeopardized by the sudden death of her band mate. However, she decided to perform at the last minute, arranging the song backstage and writing the lyrics on the back of her hand. “It was the first time where I felt like I performed really honestly because I was so tired from my own grief and my own illness,” she said. The raw performance was a turning point in her career. “After that was when I got the offer to play at Lolla, and along with that came a whole slew of experiences.”
As a result, Easterlin has transitioned from mostly performing solo to playing with a full band in order to flesh out her live shows at outdoor music festivals. “I called up my friend who played bass, I called up my friend who played drums, and he called up his friend who played percussion, and we all got into a room and rehearsed for six months until we played Lolla,” Easterlin said. This change was initially difficult. “It was more emotionally challenging for me than musically, because I was so used to being not just the driver in charge but the only driver,” she said. However, the decision has paid off and pushed her as a musician. “I think it enriches the end product to have input from various folks whose input I trust.”
Easterlin is now focusing on recording and writing more music. “The EP I’m about to release...I’m revisiting older things and making them more current, and I’m releasing two new tracks,” she said. She also spoke excitedly of her upcoming full-length album. “I’m writing completely new material right now, and I feel like that’s going to be a segue into the next phase of creative evolution.”

I’m a pretty cool guy. Admirers have alternatively described me as, “The reason I want to have children,” “The best and only hope America has against the terrorists,” and “He makes me hate everyone else I know for not being him.” One can see how it’s easy to forget that I wasn’t always the suave, well-adjusted ladies’ man that I am today. But it’s true; just a few years ago, I was an awkward teenager whose developing mind was losing a desperate battle against raging hormones. I was filled with all the emotions, both warranted and not, that so often accompany those years.
I’ve since shed many of the things that identified me throughout high school, like my “You wouldn’t understand, mom” haircut, but I’ve held dear to Explosions in the Sky. If you’re unfamiliar, Explosions is a post-rock group from Texas that plays purely instrumental music. When I was a freshman in high school, they were drastically removed from the rest of my favorite artists: there’s no crooning singer waxing poetic about any number of girls that he did or did not love, there’s no bass being dropped, there’s no pretense. They never hid behind the guise of irony or jadedness. They faced the unknowable abyss of human emotion with a stony resolve and a kind of sincerity that I had never yet experienced in music.
I wish there were some crystallizing moment I experienced where a particular melody perfectly struck some chord deep within me, but, to be honest, that’s not the kind of relationship I shared with Explosions in the Sky. Their music speaks to me of moods, of types of afternoons, of the countless nights I spent with nothing but my thoughts and the sparkling melodies of their album “How Strange, Innocence.” During a time when I was struggling to understand who I was and what I was becoming, I heard in that album melancholy and sadness, but also optimism and a tenacious faith in the goodness of the world.
That is what drew me so strongly to Explosions in the Sky and what still draws me so strongly to their work: the hope one can hear shining through even their darkest songs. Their work doesn’t need any words; in fact, I’ve always felt that vocals would cheapen what the instrumentals alone are able to convey. They create something raw and beautiful with each crescendo and decrescendo in “Snow and Lights.” The dissonance in the opening chords washes and breaks into swirling, carefully plucked melodies that slowly build and are drawn back out to an ocean of noise by another rolling wave of cymbals and the same opening chords.
“Snow and Lights” creates a feeling of darkness that carries through to the next few tracks, but there is some respite offered. Clear, glittering melodies peak through the grey clouds of distortion and minor chords in every song, and I hear hope in every one of those notes. As I would sit in my driveway and wonder why the nights gave rise to the next day regardless of my dissatisfaction with the day previous, I found some resolution in these songs.
The final song on the album, “Remember Me as a Time of Day,” perfectly addresses the darkness that resonates throughout the album. Listening to that particular song feels like looking at a younger self. The simple, almost fragile-sounding guitar melody slides along against a sparse backdrop of quiet percussion, never venturing beyond a safe range of pitches, almost as if it were slightly unsure of itself.  Each note is picked carefully and deliberately, as if the guitarist is trying to tell a story that is difficult to share, the other members of the band delicately nudging him forward with gentle snare drum and tender bass. For the first time on the album, the melody does not have to compete with any clashing cymbals or cascading chords. The melody alone is able to complete its story, and it is a heartening one.
Explosions in the Sky’s music is inescapably melancholy at times, but I used to be, too. The beauty of their music, what I found in it and have tried to hold on to, is the shimmering optimism that peaks out from the gloom and roar of each song and of their world. In the silvery harmonics that float above the darkness of “Glittering Blackness,” I heard an affirmation that, while maybe not everything will be okay, the important things will be. “How Strange, Innocence” plays like a heartfelt letter from an old friend, assuring me that earth is not a cold, dead place.

“Release the Kraken” is the phrase that launched 1000 memes. This iconic imperative sentence from “Clash of the Titans” was gleefully absurd, with the deep voice and straight-faced delivery of Liam Neeson. Thus, it set an endearing tone of faux-gravitas. “Wrath of the Titans” exists in a similar state of tension between stupidity and charm, tending towards the latter. The movie is definitively entertaining due mostly to the impressive special effects. However, its forgettable narrative and poor handling of Greek mythology makes for a series of impressive Computer-Generated Imagery shorts more than a proper film.
“Wrath of the Titans” opens with its hero, Perseus (Sam Worthington) living as a fisherman, distinctly not saving the world as he did in the precursor film “Clash of the Titans.” Meanwhile, Zeus (Liam Neeson) is dealing with an uprising from jilted brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and daddy-issues afflicted son, Ares (Édgar Ramírez). Shortly following is a clunky scene that explains why Perseus has renounced his position as demigod in favor of a mortal existence—just in time to be unable to use his former powers to help his father. However, when monsters attack Perseus’ home village, he is inevitably dragged into the conflict.
The movie efficiently delivers complicated CGI renderings; however, the narrative is a string of pointless series of characters always looking for a suddenly-introduced item or person, chugging along innocuously until a monster or god shows up for another fight.
These fights are the film’s true raison d’être. Director Jonathan Liebesman, whose previous work includes such expensive spectacles as “Battle Los Angeles,” uses his hefty special effects experience to provide an entertaining spectacle in the short term. The CGI sections are impressive especially in the two scenes that book-end the movie. An early monster fight employs a kind of long-form tracking shot, but, of course, with a two-headed fire-breathing chimera inserted for good measure. The final battle is a marvel of special effects, featuring a convincingly animated enormous giant made of lava, a satisfying pay-off for all the silly plot exposition—if you can call it that—preceding the ultimate scene.
The film’s violence is decidedly bloodless and refreshingly simple. Bucking the slow-motion, gory stylizations of Tarsem Singh’s “Immortals” or Zac Snyder’s “300,” the film embraces the velocity of real-time action shots and the straightforward brutality of the choke-hold, pile-driver, and repeated punches to the ribs. These fights tend to be somewhat anti-climactic—one would expect Gods to have a bit more chutzpah—but the result is a charmingly low-fi experience for such a high-budget movie.
The actors’ skills range from competent to overqualified. Worthington is suitably muscular yet disappointingly deprived of any personality. Neeson and Fiennes both give off the impression that they’re slumming for a paycheck. The dramatic weight both actors bring to bear on their roles as Greek gods that comes off as simultaneously appropriate and ridiculous.
Adding to this corny gravitas is the strange costuming, more akin to the flowing white robes of Elrond in “Lord of the Rings” than the togas of ancient Greece. The only exception to this phenomenon of overqualified actors playing over-serious Gods is Hephaestus, played by Bill Nighy, who acts his part as the delightfully unhinged God of the Forge, standing out as a dynamic—if psychotic—character amongst a crowd of actors always grimacing in their self-seriousness.
Despite the charms of some of the cast, the movie ultimately falls apart in its banal narrative. Like so many other films about Greek mythology, “Wrath of the Titans” dilutes the stories inside to the point of insipidity in an conflation of poorly-related myths—be it of the Titans or the Minotaur. What is left is an unsatisfying rehash of commonplace Greek mythological tropes.

A nine-year-old Terrence Rattigan was given two options: stop attending the theater or receive a beating. He chose the latter. Last year marked the centennial of the birth of the late British playwright, so filmmaker Terence Davies commemorated the occasion in the most flattering way he could: by making a movie. “The Deep Blue Sea” is one of the most popular of Rattigan’s works, and Davies’ film adaptation of the 1952 play brings the character-driven drama to a new audience with a fairly strong array of performances.
Set not long after the end of World War II, “The Deep Blue Sea” follows Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz), a woman who in the opening scene attempts to kill herself by gas poisoning. We soon learn that Hester’s depression stems from the miseries of her romantic life. She has left her well-to-do husband, Sir William Collyer (Simon Russell Beale) and their privileged life together because their marriage lacked passion. She has has turned instead to Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston), a young former Royal Air Force pilot who satisfies her sensual but not her emotional needs The film follows the dramatic changes in Hester’s relationships with the two men that result from her botched suicide.
The story of “The Deep Blue Sea” is related with the help of flashbacks to the dissolution of Hester’s relationship with Sir William and to the beginning of her romance with Freddie. Though the flashbacks acquaint the audience with the circumstances that culminated in Hester’s act of desperation at the beginning of the film, some of the transitions from past to present or vice-versa feel awkward or needless. Several of the movie’s flashbacks are interrupted by a view of Hester in the present smoking a cigarette, gazing out a window or reflectively staring downwards; in these cases, a simple cut to the next scene from the past would have been less disruptive.
To bring the characters of the play “The Deep Blue Sea” to life in the film, Davies wisely chose as his leads three individuals experienced in both stage and screen acting. Hiddleston exudes a boyish charm as Freddie, bringing a giddy enthusiasm to the role as Freddie laughs at his own inane jokes or gleefully reenacts war scenes with his buddy Jackie (Harry Hadden-Paton). In Freddie’s altercations with Hester, Hiddleston reveals an equally childish temper in his histrionics and furious expressions. Beale is excellent as Sir William, as well. He establishes the character as a quiet and even-tempered man, making it all the more powerful in the few scenes when his character does become emotional.
Other notable performances include that of Barbara Jefford as Sir William’s mother, who in one dinner scene exchanges barbs with her daughter-in-law as helpless Sir William watches; and Jolyon Coy, who brings laughter as the wisecracking neighbor who sees to Hester’s medical needs after the incident.
Unfortunately, the portrayal of the central character is not as compelling. Weisz’s face is obscured in pivotal scenes. As she makes a phone call to her lover in one scene, her back faces the camera. While speaking with Sir William, she casts her face down so that it is practically unreadable. When talking to Jackie about her relationship troubles with Freddie, she stands outside in a dark alley so that she is visible only in silhouette.
It seems apparent, therefore, that Davies and cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister deliberately set up a number of shots in which Weisz’s countenance would be inscrutable to the audience, perhaps to help characterize Hester as withdrawn and distant as a result of her world-weariness. If this was their intention, they are successful, but they pay a price for the decision as it becomes difficult to feel connected to the protagonist. Sadly, some of the most memorable moments in the film came from the times that Wesiz faces the screen and gives a self-deprecating smile, delivers a witty remark, or cries belivably.
“Freddie was very frank with me, so I know the whole situation,” Jackie says to Hester about her suicide attempt. “Do you?” she asks sardonically. This exchange is rather representative of “The Deep Blue Sea” as a whole. Weisz’s distant character avoids being frank with us for so much of the movie that even by the end it feels as if her situation is still unclear. Ultimately, nuanced and captivating performances by other members of the cast save this solid film and provide a fitting homage to the memory of Rattigan.

Most artsy people, myself included, like writing. But not even the most highfalutin literary artsies that Harvard can muster like Expos. Almost no one likes Expos. It’s a marvel that the course, Harvard’s cruel admissions gift to unsuspecting freshmen, has stuck around for this long. Faculty and administrators are always rushing to reassert the importance of a humanities education in an increasingly technological world. Maybe abolishing the hefty deterrent of Expos would give the appeal of such an education a bit of a boost.
Can you blame freshmen for wanting to avoid writing-heavy concentrations when their introduction to scholarly writing at the collegiate level is almost uniformly painful? There are, of course, good arguments in favor of Expos. Harvard students come from such a wide variety of educational, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds that there is a genuine need for a single course to establish some common ground.
But current Expos offerings make students loathe writing more than they improve students’ aptitude for it. I think this failure stems from the lackluster nature of the course material itself. My Expos class was about “Pop Art.” It sounded great in the description, or at least an improvement on “Darwinian Dating.” But my expectations were quickly deceived.
I remember the very distinct breed of dread that accompanied my trek to Expos at 10 a.m. thrice weekly. This reluctance was remarkable given the extreme brevity of my commute: Expos met in the Barker Center, and I lived in Pennypacker. I felt a kind of hollowness that stemmed from two dead certainties: first, that the hour would yield not a jot of useful information; and second, that everyone in the room, including the preceptor, would rather be somewhere else—indeed, anywhere else.
Attempts to establish common ground and teach basic writing skills by forcing students to read about hopelessly contrived topics in courses like “Cross-Cultural Contact Zones” are bound to fail. It would make far more sense to make all students read a canonical author or text and use that as a basis for instruction in discursive writing. Aside from leveling the playing field by providing common material for all students, this might actually lend the course a feeling of purpose.
I’m not the first person to propose such a scheme. Harvard used to have a mandatory Homer course for all freshmen. As hard as this is for me to admit as a Classics concentrator, I realize that a Greek bard who lived over 2,000 years ago is not the most accessible author and is likely to foster as snooze-inducing an atmosphere as current Expos offerings. But what about Shakespeare?
Having just finished playing Olivia in the Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s production of “Twelfth Night.” I can attest that the humor of his bawdier comedies has withstood the test of time. But, more importantly, Shakespeare’s lexicon is one of the most colorful in the English language. By the end of the run of “Twelfth Night,” our cast was speaking almost entirely in Shakespeare-isms. No one should graduate college without getting to call someone a “rudesby” or telling someone to “sneck up.” It certainly beats talking about thesis statements and body paragraphs.
Shakespeare’s language is idiosyncratic and dated, but therein lies the relish, so to speak. It’s a valuable skill to be able to read Shakespearean writing with fluency and ease, and exposure to it has refined my command of both spoken and written English. More than that, his plays are fun to read, unlike the majority of Expos fodder. If I had had to read “Twelfth Night” for Expos in lieu of Mikhail Bakhtin’s incomprehensible musings on moral philosophy, I might have walked to class with a spring in my step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JR, the French street artist who was the topic of my last column, represents one extreme of the street art spectrum. He works with communities, orchestrates planned, large-scale, universally celebrated works, and wins huge cash prizes. On the other side of the spectrum, there are street artists, like Kidult, who work on the fringes of communities or against communities, provoke general  revulsion, and get arrested.
Kidult’s huge tags­—he uses fire extinguishers as spray paint cans—across the storefronts of expensive brands like Agnés B. and Colette protest their use of graffiti-style designs on their expensive products. These tags triumphantly reclaim graffiti as a purely political act, and not simply a visual trope. In an interview with Highsnobiety, Kidult asserted that graffiti is destructive and illegal, and essentially so: “If graffiti becomes legal, I’ll stop.” He sees the visual motifs of graffiti as indivisible from their history of individual action and rebellion. Kidult’s strict sense of artistic ownership stands in contrast to the anarchic freedom of his medium—and in fact he borrows from the visual language of fashion magazines in his posters, if only to twist them into the grotesque.
A project by the Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh makes a strong argument for a different form of unsanctioned street art. He and his friends dumped gallons of purple, green, red, and yellow paint on a busy Berlin intersection, and the cars driving through the paint tracked it in all directions, making a massive painting. Iepe used water-soluble paint to ensure minimum destruction to the cars and the street—but he and his accomplices still made a quick escape and waited a year and a half before revealing themselves to the public.
The project highlights the quotidian processes of an intersection by forcing participation onto passersby, making a call to awareness of one’s commute as well as a map of the intersection’s most common paths. The internet reaction has not been entirely sympathetic (“If that shit splattered on my car’s paint I’d be pissed,” wrote one commenter on Blueline.ca), but the project’s very obtrusiveness creates the image and its meaning.
One of the most beautiful pieces of street art ever—a street performance, not a painting—is “Kolotoč/Merry-Go-Round” by four Czech artists, Vojtěch Fröhlich, Ondřej Mladý, Jan Šimánek and Vladimír Turner. They climbed a three-sided, rotating billboard by the side of a highway, and hung down three rope swings from the corners, which they then mounted, spinning in slow circles like a carnival ride. (Their wonderful video documentation can be viewed on Vimeo). The performance has a post-apocalyptic deadpan silliness: The artists carry limp pink balloons as they slowly circle above the highway, swinging their legs back and forth like overgrown children. But its real power is in the work’s transformation of a lifeless suburban space into a playground—and its daring and scrappy creativity. Though less damaging than Kidult or the intervention in Berlin, “Koloteč” comes from the same tradition. Its repurposing of a billboard and a manmade wasteland forms an oblique protest.
One final example is Mobstr, whose stenciled texts cheekily engage with the anti-graffiti authorities. He defaces a white wall with energetic swaths of blue and yellow, and writes “Come on paint me white again.” He documents another series on one stretch of gray wall. “Is this shade of grey acceptable?” he writes first, which some anti-graffiti authority paints out. “Obviously not. How about this shade?” he writes in a lighter grey, which again is painted out. “Or this one?” comes next, which is again erased. Finally he writes, “I give up.” Looking at the series, you wonder if the person charged with graffiti removal even noticed what it said.
Mobstr, like Kidult and the Czech artists, is mainly concerned with advertising, which is graffiti’s perpetual competitor for visual dominance of the streets. In one piece, Mobstr puts up a sandwich board on a city street that says, “I’ve forgotten what I am supposed to be advertising.” Like all of Mobstr’s work, the piece restricts itself visually to grayscale and stenciled capitals. Though Mobstr’s antagonistic attitude resembles Kidult’s, he opposes graffiti’s traditional aesthetic, and so represents the exact opposite of the high fashion brands who pick the graffiti aesthetic without the message.
Taken together, Kidult’s combative defacement, Rubingh’s employment of unwitting crowds, the Czech artists’ poetic repurposing, and Mobstr’s direct engagement all make use of street art’s status as a fringe activity by making transgression essential to their message—working without permission, without funding, and always with a goal of pushing people’s awareness of their environment.

A fair-skinned beauty courageously escapes from an evil queen by staying with seven small men before falling in love with a handsome prince. Sound familiar? It should. The beloved fairy tale “Snow White” has been reincarnated as “Mirror Mirror,” a star-studded, socially-aware, family-friendly spectacle. But although the formula is similar to the slightly gruesome Grimm Brothers’ original, “Mirror” effectively features beautiful costumes, humorous quips, and feminist concerns. Despite some blandness in the acting, the result is a wholesome and surprisingly entertaining film.
Snow (Lily Collins) is an 18-year-old princess, deemed as a “pathetic shut-in.” The Queen (Julia Roberts) has ascended to the throne after the King is supposedly killed by a beast. As in the fairy tale, she prioritizes her vain desire to be the most beautiful woman in the realm over all else, including Snow’s happiness. There’s just one complication: the Queen is broke. As a solution, she hopes to marry a young, wealthy and, of course, handsome prince (Armie Hammer). Coincidentally, he is the very same prince that Snow stumbles across in the woods, tied up in a tree by the seven dwarves, and, naturally, falls in love with at first sight.
Between the Prince and Snow White—not to mention the stunning queen—the cast is so beautiful it was hard to look away. Hammer’s attractiveness is blatantly acknowledged from the beginning, with the Queen saying, “Will someone please lend this man a shirt so I can concentrate?” While other interpretations of the fairy tale often concentrate on the fearsome forest or wily machinations of the Queen, “Mirror” pays close attention to the elements of the story that concentrate on vanity, with exquisite costumes for the entire cast—especially Roberts—and imaginative scenery.
As befits a children’s film, there is plenty of humor geared towards a younger audience. In one scene involving prolonged use of computer animation, the seven dwarves play a sort of whack-a-mole with one of the evil Queen’s mystical marionettes. Supplemented by a heavy dose of punches to the face, the slapstick humor between characters eventually becomes wearisome.
Although there are times at which “Mirror” milks the corny fairy tale card, such as the token “ding” following the Prince’s toothpaste-commercial smile, at other times the directing veers far away from the traditional plotline or even the aesthetic of the original Disney animated film. For example, the dwarves retain none of the same names, although one of them is still a little grumpy and another acts very dopey. Their costumes aren’t the standard elfish pajamas but rather worn, mossy-looking leather.
A fresh aspect of the film is Snow’s independence. The now pants-wearing Snow joins the gang of seven shorter-than-average men in their thieving endeavors, although she insists that they only steal from the Queen and give everything back to the poor village people who have been taxed up the backside to help finance the Queen’s parties. She refuses to allow her prince to save her from harm, instead choosing to fight the beast himself. At one point she even swordfights her “Prince Charming,” complete with witty repartée and touchés.
While the actors probably won’t be winning any Oscars for their performances as essentially remastered cartoon characters, some of the cast nonetheless did a commendable job of fleshing out their characters. Roberts does the Queen justice by managing to show both her vulnerability and her vanity simultaneously. Hammer humorously engages in some self-deprecation by demonstrating his less-than-glamorous side when he slobbers all over people, sweating and panting under a puppy spell—a refreshingly humble turn after his arrogant role as both Winklevi twins in “The Social Network.” However, the acting still remains the weakest aspect as the draw of the visually-oriented movie overshadows the characters within it.
Overall, the film put a well suited modern spin on a familiar story. Between the beautiful cinematography and underlying messages of social acceptance, the whole experience is justifiably sweeter than the Grimm Brothers’ original.

Todd Hido is a photographer who animates the mundane spaces that we encounter every day. These landscapes range from foreclosed suburban homes to bare roadways to urban apartment buildings. His most recent photographs were featured at an exhibition called “Fragmented Narratives” in the Bruce Silverstein Gallery in New York City early last year. The photographs from “Fragmented Narratives,” along with some of his other works, will be published later this year in a book called “Excerpts From Silver Meadows.” His art is also featured on the cover of the Silversun Pickups’ new album, “Neck of the Woods.”
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get involved with photography in the first place?
Todd Hido: I first got started doing photography when I was in high school. I used to race BMX bicycles, and I used to take pictures of my friends jumping ramps and stuff. It was actually something a lot of kids paid…other kids to do, so that’s how I got started in it. At the same time, I had a really great high school photography teacher, a man named Michael McClure. He noticed that I wasn’t a typical high school photography student. He…spotted that talent and encouraged me to do it.
THC: You recently had an exhibition called “Fragmented Narratives.” Could you tell me a little bit more about the works exhibited there?
TH: My work has always had a sort of cinematic quality to it. I worked on exchanging [both people and faces] to create a story of my work. Basically, it will turn into a book that’s going to come out November this year; it’s going to be called “Excerpts from Silver Meadows.” It is really inspired by where I grew up, which was Kent, Ohio. I think I have always hinted at stories of my childhood, but in this work, it goes to another level. It not only incorporates my own narrative of memory, but it also encapsulates other people’s.
THC: One of the major themes of your oeuvre is suburban homes. What is so special about them?
TH: Things I choose to photograph are almost all places that remind me of where I grew up—it almost always comes up to that. I have done a lot of work in the neighborhood that I actually grew up in, but I eventually ran out of space to photograph. I travel a lot. Whenever I go to a new place, I try to drag around and sort of search for inspiring things.
THC: Most of your photographs do not feature human figures. Where do the portrait photographs situate themselves in relation to the rest of your work?
TH: In the show at the Bruce Silverstein Gallery and also in “Excerpts from Silver Meadows,” people are totally integrated into the scene, and then there’s a narrative woven together that has to do with characters. In a lot of ways—just like I mentioned—I’ll go and find something that reminds me of home. People that I work with, they often come to me…[and] things magically come together. It’s all really related in a way. Sometimes you find something that really resonates for you.
THC: I have noticed that the titles of your works are always numbers. Does this signify anything?
TH:  They are all numbers because the number-one thing I hear from people about my photographs…is ‘Oh, that really reminds me of a neighborhood I grew up in.’ I think that this is really important…having people connect to your work in a personal manner. My work is largely based on emotional things. I put feelings over concepts for sure. The emotional content of the work is more important than the contextual content of the work. I am really interested in people connecting to my work. That’s where the titles come in. I don’t want to say: ‘Oh, that is Kent, Ohio,’ or ‘Oh, that is Hamilton, Montana.’ Titles limit the construction of an artwork; titles are sort of an end in artwork. It should lead the viewer down the path or knock them from going down the path.
THC: Also, I learned that your photograph will be featured as the cover of the upcoming Silversun Pickups album, “Neck of the Woods.” How did this happen?
TH: It’s funny how it has come about. They live in California, and [bassist Nikki Monninger’s] boyfriend is a shrewd photography book collector. She’s very in tune with that, too. They knew of my work, and they liked it a lot, and then they approached me with the interest of having my picture on the cover. I met with them, we talked, and did that. I like their music; I think that it’s really good music.

ROVING REPORTER: On Friday evening, a series of Ivy League preps, high-heeled ladies, and neon-clad models stormed Annenberg Hall in an attempt to embody the outer personae of Harvard students in the sixth annual “Identities” fashion show. What began in 2006 as an endeavor to support the pursuits of Harvard fashion designers has metamorphosed into a large-scale production akin to a show at New York City’s annual Fashion week. This year’s show highlighted the work of Jen Kao, an increasingly well-established New York-based designer known for her trademark combinations of experimental knits and structured leather. In addition to Kao’s collection, the show provided three segments entitled “What Makes a Lady,” “An Education,” and “Double Take.”
“What Makes a Lady” featured a large array of little black dresses and pastel-colored, flowing items in an attempt to show classy femininity while bucking traditional images of sweater sets and pearls. The progressive message was undercut by an unnerving tendency for the lights to wash out models’ faces on the large projector screen. “An Education” showcased men’s fashion with a retro, Ivy League prep style. The models had to ignore two inebriated gentleman who waltzed down the catwalk. The final segment, “Double Take,” focused on the dualist nature of a woman as she moves through public and private spaces.
Sakura Huang ’13, Audience member
Roving Reporter: What do you think was the strongest aspect of the show?
Sakura Huang: Diversity. Not only of skin tone but of the styles presented in the show. Even though the prep section [“An Education”] was messed up [due to the two inebriated men dancing down the runway], the show as a whole really highlighted what I think it meant to—differences in identity.
RR: Worst aspect?
SH: To speak from a fashion perspective, it was sort of obvious that the models aren’t professional. But the women were a lot better than the men in that they had more command in their gait, poses, and staying in character.
RR: Anything they could have done better?
SH: Some of the parts seemed a bit self-congratulatory: making people queue up for an hour beforehand [to get into Annenberg]. However, this is my first fashion show, so it might just be the norm.
RR: Summary of your experience?
SH: It showcased the beautiful, the fierce, and the dangerously hot.
Lee C. Seligman ’13, Model
RR: Hardest part about being a model?
LS: I think it would actually be just stepping up onto the catwalk. But then you see your friends and it turns into this awesome experience that I just can’t describe.
Jamie Kang and Veronica Barrera, Audience members
RR: Why did you come to “Identities”?
JK: We’re from MIT—Kappa Alpha Theta—and we have a fashion show ourselves called KATwalk.
RR: Anything that you thought you’d like to emulate in your own show?
JK: The make-up was very well done—and I feel that everyone was incredibly well put-together.
VB: What Jen Kao said was true as well—about fashion not being for the weak. You really do just have to be unapologetic in the way that you live your life.
RR: What do you think is essential for a fashion show like “Identities?”
JK: They need to put an emphasis on featuring up-and-coming designers. They had Anna Sui last year, which was an amazing experience. More people like her can really make a compelling show.

The Crimson Arts Board.
Sometimes an unusual shows requires a unusual review. Last week, TEATRO!—an oncampus theater company that specializes in Spanish language and Spanish-influenced drama—put on “Nuestra Señora de las Nubes,” a play by the Argentine playwright Aristides Vargas. This production was entirely in Spanish, but the cast and crew advertised “Nuestra Señora” as a show that was relatable for people who don’t speak the language. This fact presented us with a conundrum: should we tailor our review for a Spanish-speaking audience, or should we try to see how accessible the show is to viewers who can’t understand the dialogue?
We decided to do both. We sent two reviewers to “Nustra Señora:” Charlotte M. Kreger, who is fluent in Spanish, and Noah S. Guiney, who can’t speak the language to save his life. We hope that both of these reviews, when taken together, provided a balanced view that gives TEATRO!’s production the respect it deserves while still providing an insightful critique of how well the cast communicated to audience members who didn’t speak Spanish.
Charlotte M. Kreger
Sometimes memories are all you have left of your home. TEATRO!’s production of Aristides Vargas’ play “Nuestra Señora de las Nubes”—which ran from April 5 to April 7—uses recollections about the past as a thread that connects the show’s disparate scenes. Not only did it broach over-arching social problems such as repressive governments, but it also dealt with more personal issues such as mental illness and exile. Through impressive acting that explored all sections of society,  Director Enzo E. Vasquez Toral ’14’s production of “Nuestra Señora de las Nubes” intertwined light-hearted comedy and serious examination of social problems. It provided a series of vignettes that, when taken as a whole, formed a heartrending representation of both the beauty and the horrible injustice that make up life in Latin America.
The play follows the characters Bruna (Vanessa D. L. C. Martinez ’15) and Oscar (Adrian Arteaga ’14), who both hail from Nuestra Señora de las Nubes—an imaginary region that represents Latin American countries more generally. After meeting each other unexpectedly in a new home, they reminisce, and these musings frame the rest of the play. Oscar and Bruna’s relationship to each other threaded the different scenes together, and therefore it was important that they maintained an emotional connection to the audience, as well as with each other. Their quick banter offered a constant manifestation of their characters’ deep friendship. For example, at the end of the play Oscar and Bruna ask for shelter from the residents of an English-speaking community. Although his character did not know English—Oscar only speaks Spanish—Arteaga’s body language conveyed a sense of deep emotional support to Bruna as she broke into an impassioned, English-language  plea for dignity. Despite Oscar’s status as an exile, he held himself with pride and self-worth in a way that provided a visual manifestation of Bruna’s  appeal to the  humanity of her hosts.
Not all of the play is serious. Scenes of two brothers catcalling women in the audience and the relationship between a pompous governor and his ditsy wife provided welcome relief from the sometimes heavy nature of the play.  Also, most of these characters were played by members of the opposite sex, and this heightened the farcical nature of these scenes.
However, sometimes these comic interludes hampered the show’s political message. Abuela (Arleen B. Aguasvivas ’15) would have been more believable if she weren’t so comically portrayed. Her voice and demeanor were cartoonish, and the artificiality of the performance made it difficult to empathize with her.
However, Aguasvivas’s portrayal of the conductor’s needy, air-headed wife was spot-on. She barged in on her husband’s orchestra rehearsal and with her aggressive sexuality managed to both horribly embarrass her significant other and steal the show.
“Nuestra Señora de las Nubes” provided a unique opportunity for both Spanish and English speakers. Through a balance of lightness and sincerity, it explores the pain of exile and the displacement it brings.
Noah S.Guiney
In 1888, the world changed: a French-born inventor by the name of Louis Le Prince shot what is commonly considered to be the first film in history.  Known as “Roundhay Garden Scene,” it was a little more than two seconds long and was filmed in a place called Roundhay, a suburb of the Leeds, England. He would have made a fortune on his invention—the Single-Lens Reciever—had he not mysteriously disappeared two years later on a train to Paris.
Le Prince’s early video camera heralded the age of silent film, which, at least for about 30 years or so, showed audiences the crucial importance of non-verbal communication. While body language is always valuable, modern viewers very rarely have to rely exclusively on what they see to understand the story. However, last Thursday I had the opportunity, if only because of my embarrassingly poor Spanish, to do just that.
“Nuestra Señora de las Nubes” provided me with 72 wonderful minutes of blissful, mild confusion.  Apart from what I could gather from the acting, I had to rely only on what I could recall from seventh-grade Spanish, as well as geeky realizations I made about the language’s similarities to English (“Soy el Gobernador” means “I am the Governor!”). Although I was only able to figure out the plot after reading the playbill, I was pleasantly surprised at how much of the characterization I could understand just by watching the action on stage.
The two leads, Oscar (Adrian Arteaga ’14) and Bruna (Vanessa D. L. C. Martinez ’15) provided some of the best onstage chemistry in the show. During their scenes together Martinez would interject very subtle bodily movements into the dialogue. She would tilt her head slightly and smile at Arteaga, and she would shrug her shoulders as she listened to what he said, hinting at the possibility of romantic interest between the two. I couldn’t understand what they were saying, but I got the emotional arc of their relationship as I watched their body language.
In another scene, the Governor (Lizette B. Suxo) of the region was talking to his wife (David L. Orama ’12). Suxo’s portrayal of the pompous official included some truly impressive eyebrow acting. They were always in motion, darting from furrowed in dignified concern to raised in surprise. These brow poses displayed a sense of mock stateliness that perfectly fit her character. Orama complemented this performance by playing up the role of the ditsy trophy wife. He was constantly curling the hair of his huge blonde wig and his over-the-top eye rolls seemed to come direct from “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.”
One of the things that makes theater such a moving medium is that what is left unsaid in the script can be articulated through the body language of the actors. “Nuestra Señora de las Nubes” provided a refresher course in just what can be expressed to an audience who can’t understand what you are saying.

The first story in Etgar Keret’s latest collection of short stories is where it gets its title: “Suddenly, A Knock on the Door.” Three separate men force their way into the narrator’s apartment, and they demand a story from him. Despite his initial protests—that he’s a writer of stories rather than a teller—held at gunpoint, he goes on to attempt to appease them. His first story, which describes the “knock on the door” that announced the entrances of the three men, is met with disdain. “It’s exactly what’s happening here right now. Exactly what we’re trying to run away from. Don’t you go and dump reality on us like a garbage truck. Use your imagination, man, create, invent, take it all the way,” one of the intruders says. For the remaining 35 stories in the portable volume, Keret fulfills this fictional promise to use his outsized faculty for invention.
Perhaps it is this formal creativity in Keret’s writing that has led some critics to describe him as apolitical. Despite his upbringing amid the incessant polemics of Israel, his stories make only oblique references to politics. The almost flippant statement, “East is east, and west is west, and all that,” and a character snorting “contemptuously” at shekels in comparison to American dollars, are the closest things to an overtly political statement through the latest collection.
Keret’s stories are, instead, feats of pure imagination: his characters are outrageous and his plots unpredictable. In “Shut,” the narrator describes a man who daydreams so frequently that he even drives his car with his eyes closed. The story “Unzipping” shows the process of shedding a superficial identity, but in a strange and arresting metaphor. “She gently slipped her finger under his tongue—and found it. It was a zipper…When she pulled at it, her whole [boyfriend] Tsiki opened up like an oyster, and inside was Jurgen.” Halfway through the collection, the goldfish pictured on the cover of the novel is introduced as a magical goldfish who is fluent in Russian and Hebrew and who keeps a lonely immigrant company for many years.
It would be a mistake to conclude from this fantasy that Keret’s prose lacks realism or relevance. Though he refuses to adopt political positions—and though his stories can be as absurd as they are funny—they are always marked by sincerity that suggests a concrete point of genesis. “Because something out of nothing is when you make something up out of thin air, in which case it has no value. Anybody can do that. But something out of something means it was really there the whole time, inside you, and you discover it as part of something new, that’s never happened before,” says one of Keret’s many writer-narrators.
Without its grounding in reality, “Suddenly, a Knock on the Door,” would not have the emotional force that it does. In “Pick a Color,” most objects and people are ascribed an epithet of color—“A black man moved into a white neighborhood…They got married in a yellow church. A yellow priest had married them,”—and initially the trope seems childish at best. Then, a brown man kills the black man’s white wife, and the yellow priest reacts with anger towards his God. Keret writes in a “silvery God,” who shows up in person to the church, and tells the yellow priest and black man in frustration, “Do you think that I created all of you like this because it’s what I wanted? Because I’m some kind of pervert or sadist who enjoys all this suffering? I created you like this because this is what I know. It’s the best I can do.” It’s no wonder that Keret’s orthodox sister won’t let her 11 children read his works. Yet the fantasy of the silvery God is so moving because it comes from Keret’s honest sentiments.
Keret’s stories are so immediately engaging because of how strange and darkly funny they are. These characteristics though, may just be another hint of a humane social-realist impulse interwoven through the book. In “Teamwork,” when the narrator is accused of being crazy, he replies, “‘It’s not a crazy look,’ I say, and I smile at him. ‘It’s a touch of the human soul. It’s what we call feeling. Just because you have no trace of it in you doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing.’”
Perhaps Keret would agree that his unpredictable flights of fancy—whether they be in a story about a woman who only sleeps with men named “Ari,” or in a single sentence he calls “The Story, Victorious II”—are products of his all-too-predictable, sad, and shared humanity. Keret’s collection “Suddenly, A Knock on the Door” veers brilliantly away from this reality yet remains emotive and relevant.

“I write from the place I live: exile,” Michael Chabon said, opening the 20th annual Robert Salomon Morton Lecture at Northeastern University on Wednesday. The University’s Humanities Center and Holocaust Awareness Committee welcomed Chabon as part of Northeastern’s Holocaust Awareness Week, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author delivered a lecture titled “Imaginary Homelands” in which he explored the interconnections between his Jewish heritage and his love for genre fiction.
Chabon continued to discuss the overarching themes in his writing in relation to what he labeled as Jews’ exiled condition, their lack of a permanent home to call their own. He described his Jewish identity and his passionate interest in genre fiction—work that falls into clear, popular categories like crime or sci-fi—as the two ongoing investigations of his writing. But, he said at the outset of his talk, “There was really only one investigation all along, one search with a sole objective—a home, a world to call my own.”
He first outlined his spiritual search for “home,” which had ended in an existential cul-de-sac. For him and the post-Holocaust Jewish people, he said, home was neither America, which he described as a fabricated planetarium show, nor distant Israel, which he said seemed at once a summer house and a fallout shelter.
He then described an enlightening moment in a chain store, when he happened upon “Say It in Yiddish,” Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich’s Yiddish phrase book. “The first thing that really struck me about it was, paradoxically, its unremarkableness, the conventional terms with which ‘Say It in Yiddish’ advertises itself on its cover,” he said. “‘No other phrase book for travelers,’ it claims, ‘contains all these essential features,’ boasting ‘over 1,600 practical and up-to-date entries.’” He paused, squinting at his audience. “Up-to-date?” he said. He interspersed quotations from the phrase book throughout the remainder of his speech, which had the audience both erupting in laughter and falling into somber silence.
The book inspired Chabon’s novel “The Yiddish Policemen’s Union,” he said, which imagines an alternative post-Holocaust settlement for Jewish refugees in Sitka, Alaska, where Yiddish is indeed widely spoken. The phrase book was also the subject of an essay of Chabon’s originally titled “Guidebook to a Land of Ghosts,” which, he explained, caused considerable controversy on Mendele, a listserv for enthusiasts of Yiddish language and culture.
In his conclusion, Chabon tied together the strands he presented at the beginning of the talk, his Jewish identity and his literary leanings. He described how he thought that as a Jewish writer he had transgressed literary boundaries with his use of genre fiction, and, while he said he at times felt like the transgender cousin at the dinner table, the Mendele listserv had gotten him thinking. He concluded by considering a provocative question: “If I could piss off so many people with one little essay, how many could I piss off with an entire novel?” he said.
Following the lecture, Chabon fielded questions from the audience before joining them at a reception and book signing.
Northeastern’s Ruderman Professor and Director of Jewish Studies Dr. Lori H. Lefkovitz, who serves on the Holocaust Awareness Committee, described Chabon as an obvious choice for the lecture. “He is an eloquent spokesperson of his generation, a self-identifying Jewish writer, and he directly speaks to the Holocaust legacy in a contemporary idiom,” Lefkovitz said.
The Robert Salomon Morton Lectures are themselves a product of exile—their namesake, Robert S. Morton, was born in Germany in 1906 and endured years of Nazi persecution before deciding to apply to emigrate to the U.S. in 1934. Bill C. Giessen, a close friend of Morton’s who grew up in Nazi Germany and taught at Northeastern for over 40 years, founded the lecture series in Morton’s honor. Erika Koss, assistant dean for research and program development in Northeastern’s College of Social Sciences and Humanities, who helped organize the event, described Chabon as a speaker who furthered the objectives of the Morton Lectures and of the Holocaust Awareness Week. “To have Michael Chabon here as somebody who brings people together as a fiction writer, who helps us enter into imaginative worlds—that is, I think, really important in remembering, so that these sorts of things don’t happen again,” she said.
One entry in the Weinreichs’ phrase book proves emblematic of Chabon’s speech as a whole and of his literary work: “Can I go by boat/ferry to ________?” Chabon described the blank in the phrase as tantalizing, impossible to fill. “Whither could I sail on that boat/ferry in the solicitous company of Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich?” he said. He has personally chosen to fill in the blank with his writing, he said—he creates imaginary homelands in his fiction, which helps him to think more broadly about the post-Holocaust Jewish experience. For lack of a concrete homeland, according to Chabon, Jews must find one in invented literary worlds or imagined concepts of home—the range of possibilities for that blank is endless.

The work of composer Osvaldo Golijov represents a fusion of musical traditions—Golijov is a Jewish Argentine musician with an Ivy League degree in composition. At Harvard Hillel on April 2, Golijov explored the roots of his multi-faceted musical style in a discussion with Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg. The talk integrated performances of Golijov’s works by his longtime collaborators, the St. Lawrence String Quartet.
Born in La Plata, Argentina, to Eastern European Jewish parents, Golijov was raised listening to traditional chamber music, klezmer, and Jewish liturgical music. But growing up in La Plata exposed him to the rhythms of Argentine culture, and he was influenced particularly by the new tango of Astor Piazzolla. Golijov then chose to study music abroad, including in Jerusalem and at the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed his Ph.D. in composition. He has since worked with celebrated artists and groups such as Yo-Yo Ma, Francis Ford Coppola, and the Boston Symphony.
In the discussion at Hillel, he said he believes that studying different cultures has given him more perspectives on how to express emotion in music. “There are many musical languages. Certain cultures have explored certain areas of the soul more thoroughly than others,” he said. Delving further into the creative process behind his works, he said his goal is to translate distinct emotions directly into music. “It is when sobbing becomes a melody,” he said of his pieces. “It makes a raw, uncooked visceral expression.”
The St. Lawrence String Quartet is closely involved in developing the style of Golijov’s compositions, he said—both in conveying his sentiments and in adding new touches. Since the early ’90s, Golijov has worked closely with the quartet, and his Grammy-nominated 2002 CD “Yiddishbbuk” celebrated 10 years of partnership with the acclaimed group. “They are my friends. I trust them,” he said.  He explained that what he writes in the score—dynamics like pianissimo, for instance—can actually be played in many subtly different ways. He lets the quartet’s musicians develop these nuances, he said, based on their own impressions of the music. “It is very hard for a string quartet to play something that they are not convinced by.”
At Hillel, the St. Lawrence String Quartet played excerpts from “Yiddishbbuk” and Golijov’s new work “Qohelet.” Golijov, Steinberg, and the quartet discussed Jewish themes in the musical works. “Yiddishbbuk” memorializes the internment of three children at the hands of the Nazis—hence the sounds of sobbing, Golijov noted during the discussion.
The piece was also inspired by lines from apocryphal psalms. Steinberg recited excerpts from some of the psalms, then inquired about the influence of these traditional works on Golijov’s pieces. “I wonder if you were even worried about how these themes are at present without having spoken word,” Steinberg said. Golijov replied that once he had written the piece, he intended the inflections applied by the players to bring out the emotions in the psalms.
The members of the quartet spoke about the importance of their playing technique in capturing the feelings Golijov intended. “It’s important how the bow is handled. If you don’t really go for it, it has a different sound,” violinist Geoff Nuttall said. “It gets to the point that you’re so zoned into your training that you have to push the boundaries as a professional. Then [Golijov] starts to hear the notes that he wanted.” To demonstrate different ways of handling their instruments, Nuttall and the musicians then played multiple interpretations of the same passage of music.
Elaborating further on the development of his musical style, Golijov also mentioned people and moments in his life that have shaped him as a composer. He noted that his great-grandfather, an organ player, was the most influential person in his life. This inspiration is audible in some of Golijov’s works with larger ensembles, such as the piece “She Was Here,” in which the horns and clarinets play long, organ-like notes.
Golijov also said he appreciates other groups performing his works. He made reference to how often and how successfully Shakespeare’s works have been reimagined, and he said he encourages different interpretations of his music and of music in general. “There are so many ways to say, ‘To be or not to be,’” he said. “Music is a dialogue with the entire culture. It is a two-way street.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Climbing the curved stone staircase and entering the hushed marble foyer of the Houghton Library is like entering an ancestral monument. In contrast to the teeming Lamont Library just across the lawn, Houghton’s expansive ceilings and furtive hallways are serene. Stepping through its doors, one can sense the range of history that is locked in cabinets just beyond reach.
Houghton’s current exhibition, which opened last week, pays homage to the scientific drawings of Edward Lear at the bicentennial celebration of his birth. In my childhood, I knew this British poet and artist as the man who wrote “The Owl and the Pussycat” and whose nonsensical drawings decorated the tiles around our kitchen sink. Yet this latest exhibition put on by Houghton celebrates the side of the man often forgotten: his talent for painting scientific images of animals, particularly  life-like drawings of parrots and birds.
This wondrously extensive collection reflects the life-long obsessions of notable collectors Philip Hofer and William B. Osgood Field. But how the exhibition should be appreciated is less than straightforward. Can we consider the collection of Lear’s scientific drawings—not the components but the assemblage—a work of art in and of itself?
The opening of the exhibition also coincided with the Philip Hofer Prize for Collecting Books or Art, a prize that raises further questions about the merits of collecting. The private collector is often attacked for hiding works of artistic and historical value, and the inherent costs of collecting restrict its participants to a select few. The Lear show reflects the obsession, rigor, and knowledge of two private collectors, yet presents Lear’s works in a public forum so that the greatest number of people might also view the preserved artwork. Visibility presents a possible solution to the moral problem with collecting.
CHANCE AND COMPASS
Whether collecting is an art form or not, it evokes a passion in collectors that can rival that of artists. On Dec. 7, 1984, William P. Barlow Jr.—a well-known collector specializing in books printed by 18th century English printer John Baskerville—gave the ninth of the Engelhard Lectures on the Book at the Library of Congress that was entitled “Book Collecting: Personal Rewards and Public Benefits.” Beginning his talk, Barlow stated, “The collecting experience, it has always seemed to me, is so personal that it is both painful to write about and impossible to communicate.” These words almost resemble the sentiment of artists or writers when they are asked to discuss how they produce art. The act of creation is something difficult to communicate or express—much like Barlow’s inability to discuss the act of collecting—precisely because it is too “personal.”
Barlow goes on to discuss the process whereby a collector pieces together a collection. It begins—as all works of art—with chance. Barlow, already the owner of a printing press at age 16, read about 18th century printer John Baskerville in a book. It was then, while in Pasadena during his freshman year at college, that Barlow stumbled across a set of Milton’s works printed by Baskerville. This stroke of luck was the conception of his collection—a collection that has come to span his life.
Barlow’s experience in Pasadena mirrors the chance finding described by William Kentridge in the second of his Norton Lecture series “A Brief History of Colonial Revolts”; Kentridge showed a brief clip from his black-and-white comic opera “The Magic Flute” in which a man with spindly legs walks across the screen. Kentridge described how the image of the man came about purely because a pair of mathematical compass legs were lying on a surface of his studio. The chance finding of this compass thus gave rise to the artistic image on the screen—much like the chance finding of an object that might give rise to a collection.
Hope Mayo, the curator of the Department of Visual and Graphic Arts at Houghton, emphasizes that a collection is not a mere accumulation of objects. “A collection might begin with an accumulation, but it must then cohere in either form or subject. The collection is more than just an accumulation,” says Mayo.
The Philip Hofer Prize for Collecting Books or Art, which is given in the name of the founder of the Department ofPrinting and Graphic Arts, emphasizes the coherence of a collection over the rarity and cost of the pieces within it. A body of items must be unified and, by being an assemblage, reflect a meaning different from the individual pieces. In this sense, the collection comes to reflect a work of art: a work of art is a composition, a piecing together of various fragments to construct something unified and different to its individual parts.
PRIVATE EYES
The invention of printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440 can be conceived as the beginning of modernity because the printing press allowed the material spread of knowledge in a way that was previously unfathomable. The mass production of books has altered the way in which art and books are now consumed. Particularly in an age of mass media, where information is freely available via the Internet, art and books are sometimes considered public property. Indeed, it could be argued that in order for art’s potential to be fully acknowledged, it must be seen, used and studied by as wide an audience as possible.
Yet privacy plays an integral role in collecting. A private collection can be considered elitist by the very nature of its privacy since its objects can only be appreciated by a select few. Yet, the importance of the private collector is evinced by the fact that the collections of public institutions—including Houghton Library—are composed, for the large part, of individual donations. As illustrated by the lives of both Barlowe and Philip Hofer, the eccentricity, obsession, and passion of the private collector is key to amassing a comprehensive collection.
The split between private and public ownership of valuable objects is a difficult boundary to chart. The lack of an audience potentially renders collecting a matter of recreation rather than a display of handicraft. But, more importantly, collecting raises a series of moral dilemmas.
COINING THE MARKET
The Occupy Museums movement argues that art and valuable objects are not being made freely accessible to the public. As written on the Occupy Museum’s official website, “Galleries and museums increasingly operate as profit-driven business….This system…has emaciated the breadth of art available to the public.” On these grounds, it would be easy, but arguably ignorant, to dismiss collecting.
Ross P. Ford ’12 was last year’s winner of the Philip Hofer Prize for Collecting Books or Art with his collection of coins entitled, “Traveling Art of the British Empire (1884-1947), a Numismatic (Re) Collection.” Ford has been a collector since an early age. His grandfather—an avid collector of coins himself—initiated Ford’s penchant for collecting by encouraging Ford to find the state coins as a child. But despite his personal motivations for collecting, Ford reflects the passion and determination of a collector whose aim is not to hoard objects of value, but to recognize and preserve these objects.
“I like to find things as cheaply as possible, to find something beautiful for nothing,” says Ford. “The market is often so absurd, as people don’t understand the value of things, so I am able to find objects of value at very low prices because their value is not being recognized.”
Ford is not a collector with a limitless budget who shops only at the world’s most expensive auction houses. Rather, he
enjoys hunting for forgotten objects in Goodwill and at street markets, and he relishes the thrill of finding a valuable object for nothing. He illustrates that collecting is not merely reserved for a select few.
FINDING MARIA
Ford sees the activity of collecting as a vital pursuit because, by finding objects of value that have been forgotten, he helps preserve items of historical signifance. It is the act of collecting, of sourcing, recognizing, and acquiring these objects of historical and artistic importance that prevents parts of our historical past falling out of the material record.
Whilst travelling through Europe the summer after his freshman year, Ford stumbled across relics of material history in markets in Istanbul and along the Balkan Peninsula. In Bulgaria, he came across what collectors call a cornerstone: the object that is the unifying piece of the collection. For him, it was the Maria Thaler Dollar silver coin.
The act of collecting can open up areas of historical knowledge previously unknown. Another coin in Ford’s collection bears the face of Englishman James Brooke, who became the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The Brookes—an English family of an army officer— were the rulers of Sarawak for three generations and possessed the power of life and death over their subjects. After discovering this coin, Ford came to learn about the White Rajah dynasty of Sarawak—a startling and intriguing fragment of colonialist history.
Ford’s experience illustrates how objects serve as historical repositories: each a door into a past that may have fallen out of the historical record, or, if not, at least out of our consciousness. Similarly, the new exhibition of Edward Lear in the Houghton Library forces us to remember a crucial part of Edward Lear’s career that often remains forgotten.
VERDEAN VEHICLE
Collections can also function as vehicles of social advocacy. This is exemplified in this year’s winning collection, by Carla Martin, a Ph.D. student in the Department of African and African American Studies and entitled “‘Nos lingua, nos kultura, nos identidadi’ (‘Our language, our culture, our identity’): Books in and about Cape Verdean Creole.”
“Ultimately, this collection, while a source of daily inspiration to my own research and writing, is inherently political in nature,” Martin wrote in an email. Martin has spent the past decade involved in various research and civic engagement projects in Cape Verdean communities. “Its broader implications include potential progressive social development (through education, social enfranchisement, and political participation) for Creole-speaking communities. I strongly believe that it is through the collection and dissemination of Creole language materials that further advocacy work will be made possible,” she wrote.
Martin’s collection includes written texts pertaining to the language of Cape Verde, such as poetry, fiction, children’s storybooks, and non-written or sonic texts such as sheet music. Martin, the U.S. Representative of the National Library of Cape Verde, regards this work as vital, not only to her own individual project, but to making publications from Cape Verde freely available to communities around the world.
“Each year, I organize multiple book fairs in conjunction with cultural events. As a result of these book fairs, members of the United States-based Cape Verdean community now have unprecedented access to these publications,” Martin wrote.
Carla’s work illustrates the societal role a collection project can perform. Carla collects texts for her own research and ownership, but her collection simultaneously sheds light upon the cultural context of Cape Verdean Creole, and constructs possible paths for social development in Creole-speaking communities.
LEAR SCREEN
In the fall of 1984, the Harvard Library Bulletin published an article entitled “Prince of the Eye: Philip Hofer and the Harvard Library” written by William Bentinck-Smith. In the article, Bentinck-Smith described Philip Hofer as a “librarian, trustee, world traveler, collector and donor, founder and long curator of the College Library’s Department of Printing and Graphic Arts.”
As this lengthy list implies, Hofer was an extraordinary collector to whom Mayo attributes “revived interest in book illustration.” Hofer was not merely an extensive private collector, but he also founded the Harvard department dedicated to the preservation of printed works and illustrations.
As illustrated by Ford and Martin, the private collector is a fascinating, and often eccentric individual, one whose passion for a particular subject will take them delving through markets and auction houses, whose eye is always searching for an object of value. Their collections are highly personal and thorough and serve a higher purpose than the mere accumulation of objects: preserving material history or even aiding social advocacy.
Even so, how can the problems of private collecting be solved? The solution is in Philip Hofer’s work and in the sentiments expressed by Carla Martin. “I have already started the process of digitizing those works in [my] collection that fall under the category of public domain, and have plans to make them available on this website,” Martin wrote.
The exhibition space comes to reflect the unity of the private collection with the public space, while allowing for collections to serve a larger societal purpose. But the exhibition space is itself limited by location and access. The possibility of digitalizing collections offers permanent and limitless access to all collections, and both Martin and Houghton Library have plans to digitalize collections in the near future—Houghton intends to digitalize the pictures by Edward Lear currently being exhibited. The digital age, despite the repercussions it may have on the longevity of the material book, could render valuable artistic and historic documents freely available to all. Technology presents the possibility of further accessibility, but ultimately, the donation of private collections to public institutions allows a general public to appreciate the fruits of a collector’s passion, no matter how obscure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent interview with the Harvard Independent, an anonymous representative of the newly-formed group, Munch, which stylizes itself as a resource and community for Harvard undergraduates interested in the BDSM subculture (an initialism that stands for bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism), insisted that “the BDSM community in general and here at Harvard has a huge emphasis on consent and negotiation.”  I had to cock an eyebrow.
To be clear, I do not like policing anyone’s consensual, harmless, sexual proclivities.  Nor do I wish to condemn Munch, however sensationalized the Crimson’s coverage might have been. But any utopian claim that the BDSM community-at-large “hugely” upholds consent is a naiveté that is too dangerous not to address.
The BDSM community has a problem with non-consent.  A big problem.  In late January, salon.com published an article in which kink educator turned advocate Kitty Stryker claimed that abuse in the community is a “systematic issue” and that she had “yet to meet a female submissive [masochist] who hasn’t had some sort of sexual assault happen to her.”  Stryker’s confession has sent shock waves throughout BDSM blogs and the BDSM social networking site, Fetlife.com, where a disturbing deluge of horror stories of abuse and systematic cover-ups have begun to appear.
Stryker has not been the first to claim that the problem is systematic.  In 2011, prominent kink educator Mollena Williams, who spoke at Harvard as part of Sex Week, published an account of her rape within the community and her subsequent distress that her “story was common. Standard. Typical.” In 2008 in “Are We Men a Bunch of Lying Pricks?”, Jay Wiseman, author of the canonical book SM101, wrote of his similar epiphany when a woman revealed her shock that Wiseman didn’t rape her during kinky play.
At the center of this maelstrom of abuse is the nebulously defined nature of consent in the context of BDSM. According to the idealized narrative that the BDSM community feeds the outside world, the masochist and sadist agree beforehand, in a contract, what activity will or will not take place in a “scene,” the sharply limited fantasy space in which kinky activity occurs. The sadist cannot exceed the bounds of this contract, and the masochist can terminate the scene at any time by the invocation of an agreed-upon safe-word. The use of the contract prompted post-Freudian theorist Gilles Deleuze to term masochism an “ironic subjugation” of the “sadistic” partner, and ethnographers like Andrea Beckmann and Stacy Newmahr have continued to maintain that BDSM is subversive because, among other things, the supposedly subjugated partner is actually in control.
The theory does not match the reality. In an essay that draws on work by ethnographer Margot Weiss, Thomas M. Millar discusses what he terms “domism and sexism intersectionality.” He joins a chorus of other voices, including those of Stryker and those of bloggers Bitchy Jones and MayMay Moscovitz, in confronting the rampant prejudices at work within the BDSM community, in which all women are assumed to be naturally masochistic and all men are assumed to be naturally dominant. Dominant women, submissive men, and the non-heteronormative are stigmatized, while submissive women are often plagued by men who assume that they are constantly in the mood to be dominated by any male, consent-be-damned.
More sinisterly, the alignment of sexual roles along gender lines results in a community in which sexual violence, far from being differentiated from consensual kinky play, is normalized and glamorized. The result is the crumbling of the distinction between the fantasy of a sharply limited, contractually controlled scene and reality. Stryker, Millar, and others have written extensively on the problems this breeds: scenes with unclear beginnings and ends, scenes that begin without negotiation, the glorification of “edge-play” (play that is dubiously consensual), the pressure on women to play the submissive role, the pressure on submissives not to use their safe-word, the confusion between kinky play and actual rape or domestic violence, and the insistence that abuse cannot happen in the community because, after all, submissives like to be abused.
I do not believe that Munch, due to its small size and isolation from the broader community, is as infected with these problems as, say, the Boston scene.  Nonetheless, I urge Munch to be as aware of issues around consent as possible and to strictly maintain the boundary between fantasy and reality.
Samantha A. Berstler ‘14 is an English concentrator in Kirkland House.  She is currently pursuing research in trauma theory, consent, and alternative sexual communities.
This article has been revised to reflect the following: The original version erroneously claimed that Contact Peer Counseling and the Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention Response did not have literature to help differentiate between kinky play and abuse. In fact, CPC and OSAPR have such literature available.

As the commuters filled Athens on the morning of April 4, a 77-year-old Greek pensioner shouted, “I don’t want to leave debts to my children” and shot himself. Unfortunately, such events have become increasingly common. In the first half of 2011, Greece’s suicide rate increased by 40 percent, leaving many Europeans wondering why. During a solidarity rally in Athens following the public suicide, one plumber pointed to Parliament and stated, “It’s those in there that killed him, and they’re killing us all.” One note pinned to a tree near the site of the suicide said, “Austerity kills.” And the Greeks are not alone. From Spain to France and the United Kingdom, protests blaming the government for economic plight have swelled. The protesters and workers of Europe are right to be frustrated, but they are frustrated for all of the wrong reasons.
Since World War II, the European continent and Western Europe in particular have been attempting to build a new society, one that would provide the institutions to solve the persistent problems of the past. With massive amounts of aid from the United States, the European recovery from the devastating war was a success. Industry grew, education was reformed and expanded, and with rapid economic growth, European governments could easily afford to provide generous benefits to their citizens and grow the state. Looking forward, it appeared that Europe was destined to converge with the United States. Instead, it diverged, falling away from its global rivals throughout the 1990s and collapsing in spectacular fashion during the Great Recession.
In their attempts to guarantee comfort and economic security for a lifetime, the European governments, with the support of the people, broke the foundations of their economies as they constructed their new society. With increasingly regulated labor markets to protect consumers and workers from economic misfortune, advancements and changes within the economy became increasingly harder to adapt to. The computer and internet revolutions presented more of a struggle than an opportunity, and European productivity continues to lag behind the United States as the continent attempts 20th century research and development in the 21st century world. With permanent contracts increasingly expensive and stringent, European firms during the 1990s began to rely on short-term contracts to allow them to adjust to fluctuations in economic conditions. The majority of the young workers in Europe were employed through these contracts, and without the ability to fire those on permanent contract, these same short-term positions disappeared in massive numbers during the current recession. In Spain, they’ve made up 90 percent of all jobs lost. As a result, 17 million young people are out of work in Europe today, and only 5.5 million of them are still searching for jobs. They not only lack an income; they also lack hope.
As protesters denounce austerity measures, those who are supposed to pay for the benefits find themselves falling through the crumbling welfare system, joining the exploding numbers of Europe’s poor. As things fall apart, they realize what they’ve lost. As the welfare state guaranteed economic comfort to everyone, charity and civil society receded. The individual moral responsibility to give had been fully delegated to the government. As government granted workers increasing power and placed heavier burdens upon employers, it effectively regulated those not yet employed out of work. Those young workers now find themselves without jobs, without economic security, and without the charity of civil society; the welfare state finds itself without much-needed revenue.
While the United States slowly recovers, Europe is left falling with a society stratified into two estates: the old and employed receive the benefits and protection of the government, while the young and poor face the consequences. To those left to dwell in the bottom tier, government regulations and economic reality leave them with no way to climb out. The inherent vice of the welfare state has been exposed: In guaranteeing economic comfort, it takes liberty and, with it, innovation and prosperity. Europeans were once supposed to show the United States how to solve inequality; now they find themselves wishing for the liberty to be able to pursue the American dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney attributed President Barack Obama’s alleged ineptitude to his having “spent too much time at Harvard, perhaps.” If learning at this university has the potential to dull one’s faculties, Romney must be speaking from experience. Not only has he earned more degrees than Barack Obama from Harvard, but, if he becomes president, he would be the most crimson commander-in-chief since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, class of 1902. Romney has not one, but two advanced degrees from this institution. He graduated from the joint J.D./M.B.A. program in 1975, and from there entered the business world. While President Obama spent three years here, Romney spent a total of four.
If Romney has indeed become aware of the deleterious effects of a Harvard education, it must have been a recent epiphany. Three of his sons attended Harvard for their M.B.A.s, suggesting either that their presence on this campus was an act of rebellion against their reluctant father, or that Romney has only caught on to the crippling effects of a Harvard education in the past few years. Then again, even this scenario seems doubtful. After all, Romney counts economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw and Kennedy School Fellow Meghan O’Sullivan among his top advisers.
Most likely, Romney’s apparent change of heart towards his alma mater is an attempt to tap into anti-intellectual sentiment in order to rile the Republican base. Since he has a hard time impressing the far-right wing of the Republican Party with his pedigree, maybe Mr. Romney thinks he can fool them into only scrutinizing his opponent’s. But seriously, he’d have more luck trying to convince them that he’s always been “severely conservative.”
Although Romney’s recent conversion to anti-intellectualism may seem humorous, what it says about his candidacy is troubling. Although the Republican Party styles itself as the party of meritocracy, their appreciation for individual achievement seems to be rather limited. Academic and intellectual merit are regularly disparaged by Republican party leaders, even as they routinely exalt the value of hard work. Experience in academia—a field in which so many conservative luminaries have served—is mocked as not being “a real job.” It is no wonder that there is a dearth of Republicans in our nation’s top universities.
In the same breath that Republicans undermine the value of academic and intellectual accomplishment, they bristle when anyone speaks against the interest of those whose accomplishments have been financial. For example, any suggestion that those whose “real jobs” have brought them immense wealth ought to pay a more in taxes is decried as “punishing success.”
It speaks to the power of the extreme right in today’s Republican party that trash-talking academic achievement is de rigeur even for candidates who hail from Massachusetts, received two Harvard degrees, and are supposedly members of the Republican establishment. This is not simply anti-elitism, but anti-intellectualism.  In an age when the nation’s problems are increasingly complex, requiring the kind of expertise that a good education provides, we cannot afford to mock those who pursue one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the most crucial moment to bring an end to the worst epidemic in recent history, President Obama has failed. Over 33 million people around the world live with HIV or AIDS and more than half of the individuals who could benefit from treatment lack access to HIV/AIDS medications. Furthermore, there have been major breakthroughs in the science of HIV prevention and treatment in the past two years. A number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of treatment to prevent transmission, specifically the ability of pre-exposure prophylaxis to eliminate infection, and the cost effectiveness of investing now so that spending on treatment can begin to drop in just three years. The volume and persuasiveness of all of this evidence led many, including Secretary Clinton and President Obama, to declare that the end of the epidemic is in sight. Last December, on World AIDS Day, AIDS activists applauded President Obama’s announcement that he would increase the U.S. treatment target from 4 million people to 6 million by 2013 as he declared his commitment to an AIDS free generation.
But AIDS activists, and the millions who are affected by the disease around the world, were soon met with disappointment. The President’s fiscal year 2013 budget proposed a cut of $562.9 million in bilateral HIV/AIDS spending through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, slashing the program’s budget by 12.3 percent. This is not the first time that advocates have been disappointed with the President on this issue. In 2007, Obama (then a candidate) promised to increase AIDS funding every year he was in office, to a total of $50 billion over five years by 2013. But in the years he has been in office, funding for these programs has flat lined. His most recent proposal to cut AIDS funding represents an abandonment of the fight against the AIDS epidemic. PEPFAR has been incredibly effective in providing treatment to millions of people, and the President’s failure to sustain funding levels for this program signifies a betrayal to the millions who need treatment but still lack access to essential medicine. These steep cuts may even mean that funding to continue treatment for individuals currently receiving medication will dry up. Furthermore, these cuts will likely lead to highly increased mortality due to AIDS within the next year, an increase in vertical HIV transmission (from mother-to-child), as well as an increase in the number of children orphaned due to the disease. At this crucial moment when we are finally becoming capable of treating those currently afflicted with HIV/AIDS and bringing an end to the epidemic in sight, President Obama has given up.
The void in political will from the executive branch has sadly been met with silence from Massachusetts’ legislative delegation, contributing to the stagnating progress in fighting the AIDS epidemic. The outpouring of global health research and information from within Massachusetts has situated the state as a leading locus of knowledge and work in this field. However, it does not seem that this focus has been reflected in the priorities of our legislators. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator John Kerry (D-MA) has had the opportunity to leverage his influential position to be a true advocate for AIDS funding. In recent years, though his private voice has supposedly been strong on this issue, his public voice has been virtually nonexistent.  Senator Kerry’s annual statement on World AIDS Day has become an empty tradition—supported by the best of intentions, but reinforced by no concrete action to ensure the expansion of AIDS treatment and prevention measures to those who need it most.  As the Obama administration has continually flat-lined or slashed bilateral AIDS funding, Senator Kerry has neglected to sign on to two recent “Dear Colleague” letters in the Senate—one submitted in 2009 and one submitted in 2010—calling for the restoration of funding levels. In recent meetings with members of Senator Kerry’s policy team, we have been assured of Kerry’s private leadership on the issues, but now is the time for urgent, committed, and public leadership. With the end of the AIDS pandemic in sight, Senator Kerry must find his voice again.
Despite the failures of two would-be leaders in the fight against AIDS, there is still hope that positive political action might emanate from this Commonwealth. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA), who fashions himself a maverick, has the perfect opportunity to step up and fill the void left by President Obama and Senator Kerry. He can reclaim the Republican legacy for PEPFAR, which was founded in 2003 by President George W. Bush. In the coming weeks, the Senate Appropriations Committee will work on a fiscal year 2013 budget. Now is the time for Senator Brown to bring attention to the need for the U.S. to continue its commitment to ending AIDS, just as he has done for issues regarding human trafficking. There are myriad reasons for Senator Brown to use his voice to renew the U.S. fight against AIDS, not least of which is the fact that millions of lives are on the line.

Harvard English professor James Wood joined a list that includes writers Samuel T. Coleridge, William B. Yeats, and J. K. Rowling when he was designated a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature last week.
Since 1820, the Royal Society of Literature has conferred its fellowship—which includes access to the society’s building in London and the post-nominal honorary letters FRSL—on luminaries in the field of writing and literary criticism.
Wood, who teaches the popular lecture course “Postwar American and British Fiction” and perennially oversubscribed seminars, was elected a fellow alongside several others, including feminist critic Elaine Showalter and decorated novelist Margaret Atwood.
When the new fellows are sworn in, according to the Royal Society of Literature’s website, they sign a book using either Lord Byron’s quill or Charles Dickens’ pen.
In addition to his post at Harvard, Wood writes about contemporary fiction for The New Yorker.
“I was delighted,” Wood wrote in an email about his recognition, “not least because I thought it might finally please my 84-year-old mother, for whom reviews and teaching jobs in far-away lands have little significance, whereas the old, bourgeois lure of letters after one’s name—well, that’s tangible!”
Wood’s colleagues and students cited his talent as a teacher and literary critic as reasons for his election.
English department Chair W. James Simpson wrote in an email, “James Wood is one of the Anglo American world’s foremost critics of contemporary fiction. The English Department is privileged to have James teaching our concentrators, and applauds his election to the Royal Society of Literature.”
Samantha J. Gridley ’12, an English concentrator, said that Wood is “personable, engaging, and so brilliant.”
She described Wood’s courses as “less like having a class and more like sitting down for coffee—without the coffee—with a brilliant mind.”
Describing Wood’s seminar “Consciousness in Fiction” as “unlike any English class,” Simone X. Zhang ’12 said that Wood’s practice of asking students what they found most striking in a text made the course resemble a book club more than a University class, as Wood liked to joke.
Gridley and Zhang both praised Wood’s ability to spark insightful discussion based on short literary passages.
Wood would “pick out the most minute excerpts and make you leave class thinking ‘wow,’” Gridley said. “He really wanted us to fall in love with the novels.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives of the Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition gathered outside of U.S. Senator Scott Brown’s Office on Monday to urge the Republican to endorse an effort to block proposed funding cuts to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
Dressed in Super Man-themed attire and wielding signs, a dozen protesters urged Brown to “be our hero” and sign a “Dear Colleague” letter, encouraging fellow senators to preserve funding levels for PEPFAR. The letter has garnered some support from Democrats, but Brown would be the first Republican to formally back the initiative.
The letter from GHAC is part of a larger effort to preserve PEPFAR funding since President Obama proposed $562.9 million in cuts to the program earlier this year. PEPFAR provides funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and relief and is part  of the President’s Global Health Initiative started by George W. Bush, which pledged $15 billion to fight HIV/AIDS around the world over five years.
The proposed cuts would be the first in the program’s relatively brief history and would break Obama’s campaign promise to increase funding for the initiative during his presidency.
“We really don’t believe in the statement that we shouldn’t be funding AIDS research and relief abroad,” Cara S. Guenther ’13 said.
The GHAC representatives have met with various Massachusetts politicians in the past, including Democratic Senator John Kerry, but after a series of meetings they were still unable to secure support. Isabel R. Ostrer ’14, one of the event’s organizers, said that GHAC members were optimistic after several meeting with Brown’s aides.
The group was told Brown was not available and instead met briefly with a member of the senator’s staff. They presented the staffer with a letter to Brown, as well as a Super Man cape signed by Massachusetts voters in support of the action.
“Scott Brown likes to think of himself as a maverick,” said Lily H. Ostrer ’14. “He prides himself on being independent of all the entrenched issues in Washington....This is an issue in which Scott Brown can kind of be a contrarian and stand up for this issue.”
Ostrer said Brown has been a strong supporter of human rights issues in the past, and it makes sense that he would support sustained PEPFAR funding.
The Senate will begin putting together its budget for the next fiscal year in the coming weeks, leaving a critical window for action against the proposed cuts, protesters said.
“There needs to be a demonstration of support in order for the appropriate committee to restore funding,” Ostrer said. The group plans to follow up with Brown on Wednesday and reevaluate if he does not agree to take action.

Eleven members of the Harvard Cycling Team were victims of bicycle theft in West Haven, Conn., on Saturday night.
While staying overnight at a Hampton Inn during a two-day race at Yale University, the cycling team members left their bikes locked in a van in the hotel parking lot.
Sunday morning, they found the van doors broken open and their bicycles gone.
“We’re really bummed out. Race bikes are worth several thousands of dollars, and the worst thing is that all of these bikes are student bikes that we bought ourselves,” said team captain Sophy T. Lee ’12.
Lee said that according to West Haven Police officers, the police have recovered five of the bikes and identified a suspect who has not yet been apprehended.
According to Lee, a Connecticut State Trooper pulled over a car driving down the highway toward New York at 9:45 p.m. on Saturday night after a civilian called 9-1-1 to report that the car had bikes hanging through its windows.
The officer found five bikes in the car and ascertained that the driver had a criminal record, including 21 counts of larceny in the West Haven area, according to Lee.
The police confiscated the bicycles because the man’s explanation for having them did not seem plausible, but without evidence of theft, the officer let the man drive away, Lee said.
Since one of the bikes had an identification sticker issued by the Harvard University Police Department, the West Haven police called the HUPD, who in turn called the members of the cycling team. “We woke up on Sunday morning to a bunch of calls from HUPD,” Lee said.
West Haven and Harvard police representatives could not be reached for comment on Monday.
After receiving these surprising wake-up calls on the second day of their race, the teammates went outside, where they found that a lock had been broken off the van’s door and pushed in. All eleven bikes that had been inside had been taken.
Cyclist Ian C. Boothby ’14 was among the victims. “We’re really pleased with the way that the West Haven police have been handling the case. They put a detective on it and fingerprinted the bikes,” he said. “They’re taking it seriously and not just brushing it off.”
Lee added, “They know the [suspect], and consider him a regular to the department. We’re just trying to figure out where he is.”
Boothby commented that the suspect had removed the bikes’ front wheels in order to fit them into his car. “This definitely seemed premeditated,” he said.
Lee recalled a police officer stating that this was one of the biggest single incidents of theft the West Haven Police had seen. The department brought in a whole team of officers despite the fact that it was Easter Sunday.
A few members of the team had driven to the race individually, so their bikes were not in the plundered van. They raced on Sunday while the rest of the team spent the day in the police station and the hotel.
The cycling team sent detailed descriptions of the six bikes that have remained missing to their acquaintances via email and social networking sites in the hope of recovering their property.
“These guys aren’t going to hold on to our bikes for long,” Lee said. “They’re very recognizable, high-end bikes. The more people that know about them, the better chance we have at getting them back.”
Lee also sought to caution other cycling teams after the theft. “I sent out a list to all of the collegiate conferences in the U.S., warning them to take the extra 20 minutes bring the bikes into the hotel room,” said Lee. “No matter where you are it just takes one guy with a hammer.”

The Cambridge City Council voted against a measure to televise an upcoming roundtable meeting—a proposal that some councillors said they hoped would increase transparency but others argued would limit discussion.
Though regular City Council meetings are recorded and aired live, roundtable meetings are not typically televised. According to some councillors, roundtable meetings are neither recorded nor broadcasted in order to encourage free discussion.
Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom proposed that the April 25, 4 p.m. meeting—which will address major developments in Kendall and Central Squares—be televised.
“People work—they work during the week, and they’re tired at night, and they have families at home, and that’s the reality,” vanBeuzekom said. “At least they’d have a way to keep track of what’s happening.”
Councillor Craig A. Kelley supported vanBeuzekom’s measure to televise the roundtable meeting.
“I think this all should be televised,” Kelley said. “I don’t see the magic in not televising them and I think that a lot of useful information, or at least a lot of interesting information, doesn’t get beyond here because it’s not televised.”
During the meeting, Kelley said that he thought the final decision was “sort of un-American on our part.”
Six of the other councillors voted against the measure. Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 was absent for the vote.
According to Massachusetts Open Meeting Law, in all but a few situations, “all meetings of a public body shall be open to the public.” Additionally, “any person may make a video or audio recording of an open session of a meeting of a public body.” This law, however, does not require that the City Council televise its meetings.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who voted against the measure, said that she thought that the Council can be more productive when the meetings are not televised.
“Whether we want to believe it or not, when the cameras get turned on in this room, the conversation is not the same level of conversation,” Decker said during the meeting. “If we televise them, they’re no longer roundtables. It actually completely overrides the purpose of a roundtable.”
Councillor Leland Cheung, who is also a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, expressed similar sentiments to Decker, and voted against the measure.
“The round table is like a study session where it gives the opportunity for councillors to really dive deep in a rapid way into an issue,” Cheung said. “When you televise it you have a very different format.”

Students in Engineering Sciences 100: “Engineering Design Projects” exhibited their senior design concepts in a series of presentations that took place from Tuesday through Friday of last week.
The year-long class, required for engineering sciences bachelors of science concentrators, challenged students to identify and respond to real-world engineering challenges, according Robert J. Wood, ES100 lecturer and an associate professor of electrical engineering.
“For the engineering students, it’s a direct application of the knowledge they have accrued over their time here,” Wood said. “They’re able to take the theory and put it into practice to make optimal design choices.”
“I can remember seeing [computer science] lectures from the past come into play during my design and thinking ‘Oh, that’s what that really meant. That’s why that was useful,’” said Tabaré A. Gowon ’12, who created computer software to help dance choreographers during rehearsal.
Following a growth trend that has occurred in many of the courses in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, ES100 saw the number of students enrolled double this year to 31 students. In a departure from the traditional lecture-based class model, the class employs a heuristic and interactive pedagogical style.
Time in class was split between student presentations of their progress and workshops that introduced topics required for engineering accreditation, such as securing a patent, understanding engineering ethics, and obtaining a professional license. Students spearheaded each step in the process, from their choosing the area of research to implementing their designs.
“Class time was really used to teach us the skills we’d need for work as engineers,” said Rashid M. Yasin ’12.
Yasin’s project—a cranial drill that allows neurosurgeons to penetrate the skull more safely—actually built on a design that had originated from a student group’s work the previous year in Engineeering Sciences 227: “Medical Device Design.”
Other students such as Gowon drew upon personal experiences for inspiration.
“During my dance fellowship in Washington, D.C., I noticed that technology for dancers was really limited to basically cameras,” he said, “I wanted to create something technological that would assist choreographers in their creative work.”
Rachel D. Field ’12 travelled to Ghana in January to conduct research and determine the design specifications for her project, a sustainable device for recycling circuit boards at electronic waste sites.
“It’s really all up to you. You determine what comes out of your project and how far it’s going to go,” Field said.
Students emphasized the sense of community that developed throughout the year.
“It was a great experience. We were all really supportive of one another, urging each other to keep working and helping each other even when everything just broke down at 2 a.m.,” Field said.
Students noted the challenges of creating their own designs including unexpected explosions, missing pieces, and having to modify and rethink their designs repeatedly.
“We have to think about every last detail, every nut and bolt. It’s unreal to be able to graduate from College having made a working, functional device,” said Kristina M. Barile ’12, who created a portable sand-cleaning device for oil-contaminated beaches.
“We praised our successes and lamented our failures, but nonetheless we learned what a typical design process is like and will be in the real world,” she added.
Some students have plans to expand their projects beyond the scope of the class. Field said she hopes to continue working with some non-governmental organizations and government contractors she met in Ghana to develop her project further.
“It really develops into a passion and something you’re really into,” Field said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For three years, co-captain Rachel Brown battled for circle-supremacy with the established ace of the Ivy League at the time, Elizabeth Darlymple of Cornell. After being named Ivy League Pitcher of the Year last season, Brown is now the queen of the league while Penn freshman Alexis Borden has emerged as the next up-and-comer with the skills to pull off a coup d’état. On Saturday though, Brown defended her throne.
Borden and Brown entered Saturday’s duel as the only two pitchers in the league with over 100 strikeouts, more than 10 wins, and sub-2.00 ERAs, with Borden leading in wins and ERA. The matchup might be the pair’s only battle before Brown graduates.
The Harvard ace entered the game coming off of one of her best pitching performances of the year. The day before her duel with Borden, Brown had dominated Columbia, holding the Lions to one hit in a complete-game shutout, her fourth of the year.
“She had good command of her pitches, she was really zoned in on working ahead in the count, and all her pitches were breaking well,” coach Jenny Allard said. “It was a very strong outing for her.”
Brown needed the strong outing to get back on track after a number of uncharacteristically shaky starts during the week prior. Starting back at a Mar. 27 loss to Bryant, Brown had accrued an ERA of 4.67 in her last five appearances (including one inning of relief work) coming into the weekend, nearly three times as high as her current ERA for the year.
“There are ups and downs and rhythms to a year,” Allard said. “She started the season strong, but just like hitters, pitchers face struggles during the year.”
Less than 24 hours after blanking Columbia, Brown’s struggles appeared to return in the first inning against the Quakers.
Penn’s leadoff hitter got on with a single to right field, which was followed by a double that left runners at first and third with no outs. Brown would have to battle out of the jam against Kayla Dahlerbruch, who sits third in the Ivy League in RBI and was next up in the Penn Lineup.
Brown managed to strike out Dahlerbruch swinging, but trouble still loomed. Next up was the Quaker’s cleanup hitter, Brooke Coloma, whose 16 RBIs to-date put her eighth in the league. But Coloma went down swinging just like Dahlerbruch.
That brought Jessica Melendez to the plate. Melendez has hit five home runs this year, fourth most in the league, but she was still unable to avoid her teammate’s fate as she struck out looking. Three of the league’s toughest hitters sent back to the dugout—boom, boom, boom. Hail to the queen.
“I definitely got fired up in the first inning and had a lot of adrenaline pumping,” Brown said. “Whenever runners got on I really tried to bear down and make my pitches work.”
After Brown escaped the first inning relatively unscathed, it was Borden’s turn to struggle. The rookie eventually ended the frame with two stikeouts and a groundout, but not before a barrage of base hits came together to give the Crimson a 4-0 lead over Penn.
Following the wild first inning, both pitchers settled into the duel everyone expected, combining for six strikeouts over the next three innings while only allowing four batters to reach base.
As the fifth inning rolled around, Brown found herself in another jam. Back-to-back singles and a double gave the Quakers their first run while setting the table for more. After a strikeout by Penn’s 2-hitter, the tying run stepped to the plate in the form of Dahlerbruch. After her first-inning strikeout, the sophomore got revenge with a single that drove in two and turned the contest into a one-run ballgame. Brown came right back and ended the inning with a strikeout.
After both offenses failed to change the tally in the bottom of the fifth or in the sixth inning, Brown took to the circle in the top of the seventh as Harvard clung to a 4-3 advantage.
The senior quickly took control of the inning by striking out Penn’s No. 9 hitter, Stephanie Caso, who had scored during Brown’s rocky fifth. Another strikeout and a groundout later, Brown had officially squashed Borden and Penn’s attempt at insurrection. In the game, she struck out 13 of the 29 batters she faced.
“They are being talked about as potentially being in the Ivy championship,” Brown said. “It was a great personal win for me over their pitcher and a great team-win over Penn.”
Long live the Queen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the three regattas of the weekend, Harvard maintained its impressive and consistent season of performances. In the President’s Trophy, Friis-Marchiando, and Central Series 3, the Crimson placed in eighth, sixth, and twelfth, respectively.
PRESIDENT’S TROPHY
Boston University hosted the women’s intersectional regatta, the President’s Trophy regatta on the Charles River.
Saturday, the winds came with excitement. Northwestern winds are known to produce inconsistent conditions on the Charles; the shifts and auto-tacks produced three capsizes.
Crews navigated constant shifts and choppy waters, both of which led to horizon jobs throughout the afternoon. Later, eastern breezes brought cooler temperatures.
“We sent two of our talented women’s skippers with two new crews—Morgan Russom and Caitlin Watson skippering and Emma Smith and Jaquelyn Cooley crewing for them, respectively,” sophomore co-captain Isabel Ruane said.
Notably, sophomores Watson and Jaquelyn Cooley marked five top-five finishes. With 81 points, the tandem boat placed seventh in the B division.
Sophomore Morgan Russom and freshman Emma Smith represented Harvard in the A division with 97 points for an eighth place finish. Overall, the Crimson women’s squad placed in eighth of 13 teams.
JAN FRIIS/LYNNE MARCHIANDO TEAM RACE
The Friis-Marchiando Regatta is a two-day competition held at both MIT and Tufts. On the first day, pre-seeded teams go to either Tufts to sail in Larks, or to MIT to sail in FJs. The top four teams from each location go to Tufts for the championship Friis race, and the bottom teams go to MIT for the Marchiando consolation race in fireflies.
On Saturday, Harvard generated a record of 6-6. It placed third out of the eight teams, securing a spot in the top four at MIT. Along with Boston College, Roger Williams and MIT, Harvard earned itself a spot in the Friis Trophy.
Sunday brought northwesterlies ranging five to 18 knots on Mystic Lake in Medford Mass. Strong winds paired with Tuft’s flattop mains and larks made for a day of fast racing. The strong trio boat, composed of senior skippers Emily Lambert and Brendan Kopp with freshman Gram Slattery exemplifies the spirit of the Crimson team.
The Crimson compiled a ledger of 4-10 on Sunday, which put them in sixth place out of eight squads.
“We’re a young team overall with some very talented seniors,” said sophomore co-captian Ben Lamont, who did not sail this weekend. “Therefore we’re focused on both winning Nationals this spring and gaining experience for the future. Emily Lambert and Brendan Kopp have led the way as our top two skippers in competition, but have also led the way in preparing the younger members of our team for competition at the highest level.”
CENTRAL SERIES 3
Harvard hosted the Central Series on the Charles River. This regatta, exclusively for New England teams gave less experienced and younger Crimson sailors a chance to get on the water.
After crew shells cleared the basin, the race day began with two to eight knot winds. Throughout the day, breezes turned westward. The frequent and unexpected shifts made for close, competitive races. Sunday, the breeze was northwesterly again, ranging from four to 12 knots in velocity.
Freshman Ansel Duff and junior Jiyan Zang accumulated six top-10 finishes during the weekend for a total of 95 points, landing the duo in 12th place in the division.
Sophomore skipper Michael Lukas and junior crew Nicholas Gordon came in tenth place in the B division with eight top-10 finishes and accrued 91 points.
“We were happy with Mike Lukas, who is a walk-on and got his first regatta.” Harvard coach Michael O’Connor said. “He did pretty well: in the first race he won the start and cross-fleet on the first leg.”
As a team, Harvard finished 12th out of 15 teams at the Central Series 3.
Looking forward, this weekend acts as preparation for the remainder of the season.
“Competition was very good.” O’Connor said. “A lot of teams are using it as a tune-up for the New England Championship, which we are hosting next weekend.”
New England Dinghy Championships will be the first qualifier of the spring. Depending on how the Crimson sails determines if it will move on to National Semifinals at the Navy in mid-May or not.

April 9 marked a big day for Boston sports. A hundred (and one) years ago, the Red Sox played their first-ever home game against none other than the Harvard Crimson. Ever since the Red Sox beat Harvard during Fenway's inaugural game, students have been trying to get their hands on Red Sox tickets. 
 For baseball fans hoping to watch a home-run soar over the Green Monster this season, Flyby has you covered.
If you're looking to score cheap tickets and don't mind the nosebleeds or seats with obstructed views, head over to Gate E on Lansdowne Street two hours before game time. There's no guarantee tickets will be available once you reach the front of the line, but approximately 300 tickets are made available before each game, with prices ranging from $40 to several hundred dollars.
 
If you don't want to risk not getting a seat at one of the nation's smallest ballparks, single seat tickets (and sometimes pairs) are often available online at the Red Sox website a week before the game. Right now, it's still possible to purchase tickets for the Sox's April 22 showing against the Yankees for less than $50.
 
A third option for baseball enthusiasts is to head over to Stubhub or Ace Ticket. While there are usually tickets left on these sites, be prepared to pay more than face value.
If all else fails, you can always go on a tour of Fenway Park for $12 and then head over to O'Donnell Field and watch the Crimson "play ball!"

Congratualtions to all involved.

A state of war exists between the Quad and the River. Last night, in response to a sabotage of the Adams House mascot poll by students in Currier House, Adams House suspended its poll and declared war on Currier.
"The leadership and students of Currier House, fully complicit, have naughtily infiltrated our mascot selection process, and for this we shall not stand," Adams House said in its formal declaration of war.
Concurrent with the declaration, Adams banned all Currierites from the House, including the Dining Hall, and asserted that Adams House now controls the Currier Tree and Currier House Crest. Adams also asserted that Currier should now be referred to as "Adams House Quad Outpost."
Adams also warned that former Currierites will be subject to pranks, espionage, and attacks on "sanity and comfort."
House wars have loomed before, though none have come to fruition quite so famously as the Pfoho-Adams War of 1999, when Adams House declared war on Pforzheimer House as a part of the debate on dining hall restrictions. That war ended with Pforzheimer being awarded swipe privileges in Adams Dining Hall. Who knows what victory in this one will mean.

An earlier version of this post said that Adams House's formal declaration of war was written by House Committee Chair for Special Projects Antone Martinho III '13. In fact, the declaration was unsigned.

In a not-altogether-unsurprising turn of events, Pforzheimer House announced its position on the recent outbreak of war between Adams and Currier Houses. In the so-called "Mario Doctrine," named after Pforzheimer Building Manager and "Secretary of Depfense" Mario Leon and modeled on the Monroe Doctrine, Pforzheimer residents outlined that they "will not tolerate expansionist efforts from any River House."
The doctrine was penned by a group of students led by Paul E. Schied '13 following an exchange on the Pfoho Open e-mail list discussing the war and its implications for Pforzheimer House.
"The proposed River encroachment into the Northern Hemisphere will not be countenanced by Pforzheimer House. We continue to recognize Currier House as a legitimate and sovereign house, and call on the interhouse community to do the same," it states.
Pforzheimer also warned that "the full might and courage of the Pfolar Bear Cavalry shall be unleashed on Adams House if any members of Currier House are harmed or inconvenienced by the treachery and snobbery of Adams House."
"It needed to be made clear to the interhouse community that Pfoho would be prepare to use pforce to prevent river Houses from meddling in the Northern Hemisphere," Schied said in an e-mail to The Crimson. 
Adams House Committee Special Events Chair Antone Martinho III '13, who issued the Declaration of War on behalf of Adams HoCo, was not aware of the Mario Doctrine as of Tuesday afternoon.
The Doctrine also made reference to the last major interhouse conflict, the Great Pfoho-Adams War of 1999. Schied concluded by saying, "We trust that Adams residents remember what happened the last time they started a war with a Quad house."

The April 10 post "Pfoho Clarifies Position in Adams-Currier Kerfuffle" incorrectly identified the Doctrine the document is modelled off. In fact, it is based off the Monroe Doctrine.
