After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The news that Harvard Square’s only mainstream movie theater will close in early July was met with sadness by Cambridge residents and Harvard students this week.
In the wake of the announcement that the AMC cinema chain will shutter the theater, community members recalled the theater’s history, from its 1920s beginning to its 28-year tradition of midnight showings of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.”  The showings are organized by the Full Body Cast, a rotating group of actors that perform along with the screening of the film.
Students especially decried the loss of the cinema because of its convenient location, just across the street from the Yard.
“My friends and I really hate going into Boston to see movies,” said Henry B. Regan ’15, a Cambridge resident who estimated that he went to the theater two or three times a month.  “It’s going to be tough to see movies during the school year.”
According to Sarah L. Burks, a preservation planner for the Cambridge Historical Commission, the theater was built in 1925 as the University Theater. In its original incarnation, the theater was a single-screen cinema with a stage and balcony. Numerous stage plays and musical groups performed at the theater; according to a 1986 Boston Globe article, the venue hosted Bob Dylan, the Clash, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Waits, Hall and Oates, and Bruce Springsteen.
Burks said that major architectural changes took place in 1982, when the marquee moved from Mass. Ave. to Church Street. The single screening room was divided in two.
Ned R. Hinkle, creative director at the Brattle Theater in Harvard Square, said that the number of screens increased to five when Loews purchased the theater in the late 1980s.
“They started playing more Hollywood movies,” Hinkle said. “I used to go to the Harvard Square when I was in high school and see these amazing double features. It was somewhat similar to the Brattle, but its focus was more on cult films.”
Cambridge resident Remy R. Prevost, a Harvard Law School library employee, said that he was disheartened to learn that the Full Body Cast’s longtime midnight showings of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” would have to find a new location.
“That’s an established thing,” Prevost said.  “I was born and raised here, and I remember going there in high school in 1989 just to see what it was all about.”
Originally, the FBC's midnight showings were at the Exeter Street Theater in Boston. In 1984, when that cinema closed, the Full Body Cast moved the ritual screenings to Harvard Square.
During the screenings, FBC members provide an energetic interpretation of the onscreen action.  Viewers are treated to bawdy skits, sarcastic commentary on the dialogue, and shouted instructions for performing the “Time Warp,” the film's signature dance.
Those who have not attended a midnight screening before are labelled as “Rocky Horror virgins.”  Before the show begins, they will be labelled with a “V” drawn in lipstick and brought to the front of the auditorium to have their virginity symbolically taken.
FBC member Arthur F. Laurie, who has been performing with the group since its Exeter Street Theater days, said that he was struck by the beauty of the Harvard Square Theater when the FBC moved there.
“Eventually it just became one of the places you went to in Harvard Square, like the Coop or the [Out of Town news],” Laurie said.
Current FBC director Alex H. Savitsky praised the Cambridge residents who have made the cast feel at home for 28 years.
“Occasionally, we’ll have a complaint from a parent whose kid snuck out to see the show,” Savitsky said.  “But it’s been a very positive community.”
The show was popular with Harvard students.
“I loved the enthusiasm of the audience and the performers,” said Ari M. Albanese ’15, who attended the show with a group of other Harvard students. “Everyone was dressed up and singing along and just really enjoying themselves. I had a great time.”
According to Savitsky, Full Body Cast staged two shows a week until 1997, when they switched to a weekly performance. Over 28 years, that would mean that approximately 2,100 showings took place at the theater.
For co-director Gary A. Greenbaum, this rigorous schedule distinguishes Full Body Cast. “This is the only Rocky cast that has been performing consistently in the same theater,” he said.  “Others put on a show once a month or so, but this is the only show that did it once a week.”
Greenbaum and Laurie both said that the Halloween weekend shows are among their favorites.
“We do three shows with an expanded pre-show before the show,” Laurie said. “Those are always awesome, and those are always full house. You can wait all year for that and always be satisfied.”
Despite the loss of the venue, the cast has no plans to end the performances and is currently scouting for a new location.
“We’ve always been in contact with other theaters for just such an occasion,” Greenbaum said.
Hinkle said that for those in the theater business, the writing has been on the wall for the Harvard Square theater for quite some time.
“It’s been rumored on and off for a long time that it would be closing,” he said. “Anyone who’s been there recently has seen it was neglected by AMC.”
Laurie sounded a somber note of farewell. “I’m sad to see it go,” he said. “Even though this theater closed and we will hopefully get another theater, [the dynamic] is lost forever. And that’s sad.”
At the Brattle Theater, an artsier cinema which was not direct competition to the AMC theater, Hinkle was sympathetic rather than triumphant at the closing of a peer.
“'Disappointment' is the best word,” he said. “Any time a movie theater closes is a tragedy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seasoned transvestites and “Rocky Horror” virgins alike turned up Saturday night for the Full Body Cast's third-to-last midnight showing of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” at the soon-to-be-closed AMC Loews Harvard Square 5 theater.
Most attendees said that they bought their tickets after hearing earlier in the week that the theater was closing. When a cast member announced that the last performance at the AMC theater in Harvard Square would be on July 7, she was greeted with boos from the audience.
“I’ve been going since it was back at the [Exeter Street Theater],” said Cambridge resident Stephen Moore. “I was really sad to hear it was closing. It’s an institution.”
But the show’s sold-out audience was not limited to regulars.
“I just turned 17,” said “Rocky Horror” virgin Renee Nickerson, who was at the show with several of her friends. “It’s a birthday party type of thing.”
The show is open only to those 17 and older. Both first-time attendees and veterans shared similar expectations for the show, which includes actors performing in front of the screening of the cult film and audience members gyrating in the aisles.
“Mayhem,” predicted Cambridge resident Devlyn Kelly, who had also just turned 17.
“Total craziness,” said Gail Bennett, a friend of Moore who has been going to shows since the movie premiered in 1975.
For Cambridge resident Hayden Schultz, the show was an opportunity to educate a younger generation.
“I saw this in college when it came out,” Schultz said. “My son had neither seen it nor heard of it, so I thought it’d be fun to bring him. Ever since I bought the tickets, ‘Time Warp’ has been stuck in my brain.”
In addition to its final two midnight showings, the Full Body Cast will present a 9 p.m. show on July 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All-American huh? Not so fast.
Two days after starting and registering 12 points and seven rebounds in an upset of the Czech Republic, sophomore Temi Fagbenle made the final 12-woman roster for the Great Britain team Friday in advance of the 2012 London Olympics, which begin in late July.
Fagbenle grew up in England before coming to the United States for high school. Following an impressive senior campaign, the 6’4” forward was named a McDonald’s All-American and was unanimously considered one of the top recruits in the Class of 2011.  After Fagbenle’s Lavietes Pavilion debut was delayed as the NCAA forced her to sit out a year, she’s gotten on the court for the British National team faster than expected.
Since joining the squad for a series of warm-up contests this summer, Fagbenle has drawn immense praise from United Kingdom coach Tom Maher, which was backed up by her inclusion on the team at just 19 years of age. She is the only teenager to make the final roster, and only the second woman in Ivy League history to compete in the Olympics.
The British are guaranteed to be competing in the Olympic Games next month because the home nation is automatically qualified for the tournament. But, unlike in past years, this team may have been able to qualify the hard way. Officially ranked 49th in the world (right behind Uzbekistan and Sri Lanka) due to years of mediocrity, the Brits have been playing up to the competition in recent contests, topping global contenders South Korea, Canada, and Argentina this summer in addition to upsetting the No. 4-ranked Czechs. Some of the recent success can be attributed to the addition of Fagbenle, but she represents just one member of a growing crop of talented British basketball players that have taken the program to a new level.
Before tip-off of Olympic action July 28th, the UK has several more tough tests to prepare itself for the Games. The squad has upcoming matches with world No. 2 Australia and No. 7 China, two teams that have already qualified for the 12-team Olympic tournament, before playing its final pre-Olympics contest against the world No. 1, and defending Olympic Champion, the United States.
That American squad will face an England team tougher than any British squad they’ve faced in a long time, thanks in large part to the play of an All-American sporting the Union Jack.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over an 11 day period, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. Now up: Market in the Square.
How do I love thee?  Let me list each way.
I love thee in the despair and darkness at the height
Of an endless all-nighter when exhaustion blurs my sight
I love thee as I welcome the dawning of a new day.
Stumbling innocently into thy great fluorescent light
I love thee, emotion shared by seniors and by frosh
I love thee dearly for the offerings and late-night nosh
I love thee purely, but in thy sushi I take alimentary delight
For delicious food, and not a chemical compound from CVS
I love thee with a faith in humanity I seemed to lose
When all other establishments so early close their doors
Certainly, a feature that’s far better than the rest
When I want food in that hour most suited for a snooze
A brief respite from what’s left to do of my late-night chores.
Behind its shining glass façade, Market in the Square is the radiant beacon in the bleak darkness of all-night studying. It is salvation at a time when Lamont is emptying out, the dining halls are being cleaned, and jaywalking becomes a right, not an obnoxious privilege.
Late night food is all about satisfying cravings. And the bottom line is that Market in the Square can do so without causing remorseful nausea and weight gain after consuming greasy lumps of fried dough and questionable chemicals with shreds of mystery meat masquerading as sweet and sour chicken.
With a symphony of flavors at your disposal—unlike the monotone grease-and-salt that are the staple of other late night food joints—the Market is where you are sure to find what you need. If you have a discerning sweet tooth and want Chimes Mango Ginger Chews rather than a gritty chocolate faux-Hershey bar from CVS, Market in the Square has its wonderful selection of gourmet and international snacks at your disposal. But it isn’t limited to your late-night cravings; if you’re getting started on some late-night baking but are missing sour cream, Market in the Square also carries an assortment of grocery essentials.
It’s probably the most serene of any of the after-hours stops. At the Market, you can peacefully settle into one of the polished metal seats with (optimal day-time people watching) and gaze out into the snowy night as you sketch paper outlines and economic models.
Put simply, Market in the Square has real food for real students who have yet to learn the concept of sleep. And there are a lot of us out there.
