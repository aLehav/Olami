After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“Into the woods / Who knows what may / Be lurking on the journey?” the cast sings in the prologue of Stephen Sondheim’s classic musical “Into the Woods.” The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club brings their own interpretation of the fairytale musical—which runs Dec. 8 to 9 at OBERON—that hopes to bring an elegant performance to an unconventional setting.
“It’s a show that everyone has seen since they were kids,” says director Jake S. Stepansky ’17. In the musical, characters taken from many different story tales—Cinderella (Arianna N. Paz ’19), Jack of beanstalk fame (Eli Troen ’20), Rapunzel (Lucy Devine ’20), and Little Red Riding Hood (Rachel Kahn ’20)—all embark on a journey seeking their Disney-like happy endings. The musical, however, takes a dark turn as the fates of these characters are quickly compromised by unknown forces.
Although the musical’s characters come from frivolous childish stories, “Into the Woods” explores some weightier themes. “[The show features] a brilliantly done series of events that makes you think that you have to be really careful for what you wish for, because you just might get it—and it might not go the way you want it to,” says Paz. The theme of a loss of innocence follows many of the characters as their eyes are opened to the harsher realities of the world.
“Into the Woods” has special relevance for college students, according to co-producer Emily E. Bergquist ’18. “[It’s about] what it means to have that moment that many people have in college where suddenly you realize the world is not really what you thought it was,” Bergquist says. “There’s so much in this show about expectations, and what happens when reality comes in.”
Stepansky says the musical as a directorial project had a unique appeal. “Everyone has some kind of personal battle they are fighting, or some personal demon they are uncovering,” he says, “so that really felt like an issue that I’ve wanted to tackle on this campus, and that’s why I’m doing this play.”
Beyond its initial layer of fairytale wonder, the musical brings about an incredibly introspective look at difficult issues around self-realization. The venue, OBERON, plays a large role in maintaining this recurrent theme. “With all of the balconies and the aisles, [it] makes it so the audience gets lost in the woods with us,” says Ashley M. LaLonde ’20, who plays the villainous Witch. “It’s a very active show for the audience—we’re singing in their faces, falling in their faces, weeping in their faces, and it essentially adds to the entire nature and ambience of ‘Into the Woods,’ which is getting lost in this magical world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
April Ayers Lawson’s debut work, “Virgin and Other Stories,” contains five short stories that grapple with sex, love, desire, and violation. “Virgin” displays a man named Jake’s experience watching his wife, Sheila, slowly become comfortable with her sexuality. “Three Friends in a Hammock” delves into the attraction three divorced women feel towards each other. “The Way You Must Play Always” portrays 13-year-old Gretchen’s desire for her piano teacher’s brother, who is recovering from a brain tumor. “The Negative Effects of Homeschooling” depicts teenage Connor’s inability to understand Charlene, a woman who was once a man. “Vulnerability” exhibits a married painter’s attraction towards her art dealer and H., one of the art dealer’s artists. All these stories function well on their own, yet the award-winning Ayers Lawson successfully connects the short stories to create one coherent and controversial work.
The themes of attraction and desire join the stories into a cohesive whole. Sometimes, short stories are only placed together because they all were written by the same person, but here, that is clearly not the case. The first story, “Virgin,” immediately brings these ideas to attention. The entire book begins with, “Jake hadn’t meant to stare at her breasts, but there they were, absurdly beautiful, almost glowing above the plunging neckline of the faded blue dress.” A flashback to the attraction he felt towards his wife, Sheila, follows this portrayal of Jake’s desire for Rachel Delaney. These elements carry over to the next story, “Three Friends in a Hammock,” after which Ayers Lawson continues to address the theme in all the other stories. Even when desire is not explicitly mentioned, like in “The Negative Effects of Homeschooling,” the idea is implicit when Connor’s mom writes only about Charlene in her diary.
Some of the themes in the pieces are purposefully disturbing and controversial, which allows Lawson to incorporate important issues within them. Sheila, Jake’s wife in “Virgin,” and the painter in “Vulnerability” are characters that struggle with experiences of sexual assault. In “The Way You Must Play Always,” Gretchen (who is only 13 years old) wants the piano teacher’s brother’s attention. This story is not only disturbing because Gretchen—who does not understand sex—desires a man who takes advantage of her to an awful extent, but also because of her desire for and sexual experiences with her cousin, Jamie. Ayers Lawson’s decision to write about rape, molestation, and sexual assault results in an exploration into the way survivors approach sex with future partners.
The structure of each story is interestingly complicated in that it switches back and forth between present and past events. For example, in “Three Friends in a Hammock,” the story moves fluidly from the tales that the narrator’s friends are telling her to her contemplation of the physical dynamics and characteristics of the friends in the hammock, then repeats. The same goes for “Virgin,” which switches between the present party scene to past events that Jake shared with his wife while she struggled with the psychological scars left of sexual assault. This structure renders the stories multifaceted and allows for the reader to get to know the characters very well in a short amount of time and space.
Ayers Lawson’s ability to compress character development is particularly impressive because the people themselves are so complex. For one, 16-year-old Connor from “The Negative Effects of Homeschooling” is a self-proclaimed “hairy chronic masturbator,” and he blames a lot of his social inabilities on homeschooling. He is impulsive, telling Ally (a girl he finds attractive) that he will marry her, and the last scene brings his violent side to the surface. He has an incredibly difficult time accepting Charlene—a transgender woman—with whom his mother is friends. In other stories as well, Lawson completes pictures of her characters’ motivations and emotional statuses.
Conventionally, stories about sex contain erotic material; yet “Virgin and Other Stories” centers itself around serious themes of attraction and desire while bringing to attention taboos such as violation and sexual assault. Universal ideas and powerful structure allow Lawson to accomplish this revision, resulting in a collection that contains more than your conventional sex stories.

For Theater, Dance, and Media concentrator and president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, theater at Harvard is a driving passion and a primary academic and extracurricular pursuit. But theater at Harvard is also a world in which Brophy, a black student, says that she has had to claim space for herself and the expression of her identity. “I don’t frequently see a lot of people who look like me on stage,” she said. “For me, it’s really exciting when I see someone who looks like me doing what I want to do. So that’s what I want to be for somebody else.”
Brophy’s experience offers just one example of a much broader campus conversation about the arts and inclusivity. As Harvard’s undergraduate student body has grown ever more diverse, many challenges remain in making the University a fully open institution for all those admitted. From the ongoing dialogue over social spaces to the movement to protect undocumented students, from criticisms of affirmative-action admissions practices to protests after the election of Donald Trump, issues of identity and belonging have been at the forefront of discussions on campus in the past weeks and months. The intersection of these questions with the arts has also emerged as a key focus for debate, most recently during the controversy over the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ fall production of “The Mikado.”
According to The Crimson’s annual survey of graduating seniors, students of color at Harvard are less likely to concentrate in the arts and humanities than their white peers. Students, faculty, and administrators cite a variety of possible reasons for this disparity: socioeconomic pressures to pursue more obviously marketable majors, lack of access to arts programs in high school, and lack of diversity in curricula and faculty in the arts and humanities departments of the university. Many administrators and faculty now express a commitment to broadening both their course offerings and the demographics of their teaching staff to reflect the interests and identities of an increasingly diverse undergraduate population.
Outside the classroom, meanwhile, students are exploring issues of identity and inclusion, culture and history, through a wide variety of creative extracurriculars. Across the University, both faculty and students say that making the arts more open and more responsive to broader social concerns has rarely been so important. Following the election of a presidential candidate who in his campaign demeaned specific minority groups, many of those interviewed suggest that the arts can serve as a means to put forth a different vision of American citizenship and to reassert the values of tolerance and diversity.
The Crimson’s 2016 survey of graduating seniors showed that about 10 percent of surveyed students of color—Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska native, Asian, South Asian, Black or African American, and Pacific Islander students—had concentrated in an arts or humanities discipline, compared with 14 percent of white students surveyed. In total, 906 students responded to the survey—representing more than half of the class—although not all respondents answered every question. The survey, sent to seniors by email and open from May 5 to May 11, was anonymous, and The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias. Fifty-seven percent of students of color concentrated in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, compared with 45 percent of white students. From top administrators to students, many within the University see this gap as a problem.
For Robin Kelsey, Dean of the Arts and Humanities Division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the issue of inclusion has become increasingly important as Harvard’s student population has changed. “Making the arts and humanities responsive to the unprecedented diversity of Harvard’s undergraduate student body is one of my highest priorities as dean,” he said.
Kelsey said that he would hesitate to assign a definitive cause to the lack of diversity within the arts and humanities at Harvard as compared to STEM concentrations. “As we know, correlation and causation have a very tricky relationship,” he said. However, he speculated that socioeconomic factors might play a role. “To begin with, students of color by and large come from less-privileged backgrounds than white students. The more comfortable you feel economically, the more free you may feel to pursue a study that you love. This places the arts and humanities at a disadvantage with students from economically less-privileged backgrounds, regardless of the color of their skin or their ethnic identification,” he said. Kelsey said that students who felt themselves or their families to be less economically secure may feel pressure to choose a concentration with clear professional applications.
Suzannah Clark, chair of the Music Department, agreed. “No matter what one’s race or identity, [if one is] either a first-generation college student or economically disadvantaged or on financial aid, there can be pressures to think about how one can use one’s degree later for employment,” she said. “Sometimes people worry that the arts and humanities don’t necessarily lead to the most obvious jobs afterwards.”

Sarah E. Lewis ’01, assistant professor in History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies, added that the pathway to careers in the arts can involve years of unpaid internships, which many students cannot afford. “I was a social studies-art history double concentrator here, and I did notice that I was one of the few students of color who saw a career in the arts as my future,” she said. “But given the changes that are occurring in the art world to start to do away with the unpaid internship model, and I think the increasing visibility of many—my colleagues and artists of color—who are pioneering work, indispensible work, today, we’ll start to see some change.”
Students themselves cite the barriers to access to the arts that result from economic disadvantages. Nicolas E. O’Connor ’17, a Latino student of Ecuadorian descent who concentrates in English and is involved in campus theater, said that he felt lucky to have had a strong theater program in his high school. He added that many students of color come from schools that lack well-funded arts programs, which may impact their interest in or sense of preparedness to pursue the arts once they arrive at college.
Lewis also noted that students’ experience of inclusion in or exclusion from the arts begins long before college. “Not teaching art in most public schools makes it harder to have a diverse pipeline [of students] entering the programs at the undergraduate and graduate level,” she said.
Many faculty and students also expressed concerns about a lack of diversity in the curricula in arts and humanities concentrations at Harvard. Brophy said although the standing committee on Theater, Dance, and Media is working to increase the number of courses focused on non-Western art, these courses remain relatively scarce and are often general surveys. She explained that incorporating both breadth and depth into studying art outside the Western canon remains a challenge. “I find [it] frustrating that when non-Western traditions are brought into the curriculum, it’s frequently in a class that purports to do a broad survey of all of a section of non-Western culture,” she said. “So if you’re taking a class on, say, African theater, you’re like, ‘I’m learning about all of African theater this semester?’ And you’re not. But on the other hand, if you don’t have foundational courses, it seems odd to have very specific courses that address things.”
Martin Puchner, chair of Theater, Dance, and Media, said that the committee is mindful of the need for diversity of representation in the concentration’s courses and productions. “[W]e are extremely committed to a diverse group of concentrators and faculty, and we seek to foster that commitment in the design of the curriculum and our various concentration activities,” Puchner wrote in an email. He added that TDM includes a world theater requirement and that November’s concentration production of August Strindberg’s ‘A Dream Play’ included a diverse cast and addressed issues of inclusion through a new interpretation of the work.
O’Connor also discussed the lack of ethnic and racial diversity in the English curriculum. He noted a narrowness of focus on relatively few well-established authors of color in the English courses that do incorporate literature by non-white writers. “As much as I love Junot Díaz, half of the courses that involve people of color will read his work,” he said.
James Simpson, chair of the English Department, said that the department is currently working on a motion “with regard to diversity.” In an emailed statement, Simpson wrote that the wording of the motion  had caused debate at a department meeting in late November and the department decided to redraft and will likely reconsider the motion in its next meeting at the end of January.

Another factor cited by both students and faculty was the lack of diversity in the faculty in many arts and humanities departments. Elaine Dong ’17, a visual and environmental studies concentrator, said that this lack has come to feel normal for her. “Really the only non-white mentor that I’ve ever had in the visual arts is the painting teacher that I took classes with [beginning when] I was around 10 years old,” she said. “Since entering high school, all of the artists that I’ve really known well have been white. That’s not something that necessarily bothers me all that much, partially because I guess that’s all I’ve ever really known.”
Lewis added in an email that a dearth of mentors and role models of color in arts careers may perpetuate unequal representation. “As I see it, the barriers have to do with modeling and economics. By modeling, I mean that you can’t always see what you can’t imagine,” she wrote. “So if the field appears homogeneous, many students can assume that the arts are not for them.”
However, Kelsey stated his commitment to making faculty searches more inclusive and open to people with identities that are currently underrepresented on the faculty. “The most important thing for us to do, I think, vis-à-vis the undergraduates in terms of the diversity of the curriculum and addressing the diversity of the students, is to make hiring decisions that are cognizant of these needs,” he said.
Some arts and humanities departments have already begun bringing in faculty who are committed to teaching courses focused outside the traditional canon. In the Music Department, Vijay Iyer, hired in 2014, teaches courses focused on creative music, which he says has deep roots in jazz and in the African American musical tradition. Yosvany Terry, hired in 2015, teaches a “Foundations of Modern Jazz” course that incorporates the work of composers from Benin, Israel, Cuba, and Venezuela. In the Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures and History and Literature, Assistant Professor Lorgia H. García Peña, hired in 2013, is one of the University’s first professors focused on Latino studies. And Lewis, who joined the faculty in 2015, is teaching “Vision and Justice,” a class focused on the intersections of race and aesthetics in America, for the first time this year.
Faculty diversity remains a concern for many arts and humanities departments. The Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, for example, currently has no faculty members who are people of color, according to Robb Moss, the department’s chair. He emphasized, however, that the entire department is engaged in an ongoing conversation about issues of inclusivity. “[Lack of diversity], I think, is a problem, and it’s something that the faculty is talking a lot about,” he said. “People should not think that artists need to be white.”
In an emailed statement following the interview, Moss stressed the department’s dedication to inclusion. “This year, VES is mounting two searches whose chairs and committee members are committed to adding diversity to the VES faculty,” he wrote. “While the faculty in VES are extraordinary artists, scholars and educators, we are not as diverse as the fields we represent, nor are we as diverse as the students we teach. At this point in our history, it is our responsibility to improve this situation by increasing the diversity of our applicant pools and by staying alert to our selection processes. This does not mean selecting for diversity, but it does mean creating a rigorous process where everyone has a chance to be chosen.”
Carrie Lambert-Beatty, a professor in VES and history of art and architecture, added that she felt that VES has made significant progress toward mounting more inclusive faculty searches. “We are just more aware of the places where bias slips in and narrows the pool in ways that make it difficult to get a more diverse faculty,” she said. “So that’s been really important, and I see the cultural shift happening, but we don’t have the results yet that we need.” She noted that the department is small and opportunities to hire new faculty are thus relatively rare.
However, even as academic departments are becoming gradually more inclusive, students are taking matters into their own hands by exploring culture and identity through the arts outside the classroom. According to Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts, students have worked hard in recent years to make the campus arts scene more inclusive. “I think that students of color are in some sense taking the lead, and saying, ‘No, this is what the arts at Harvard are too. This is who we are, and we want arts and culture to reflect who we are,’” he said.
For students concentrating in disciplines both within and outside the humanities, arts-focused extracurriculars—theater, music, dance, and more—can provide a space in which to explore their own cultural traditions and to be part of a community that shares those traditions. Megan said that in his time at Harvard, he has seen campus artistic productions become significantly more diverse. “When you look at dance, for instance, 30 years ago you would have seen modern, you would have seen ballet, you might have seen tap here at Harvard,” he said. “Now you’ll see Bhangra, you’ll see the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble, you’ll see the South Asian Dance [Company].”
Ryan F. Boyland ’17, a black student concentrating in neurobiology, joined the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, a choir that performs music of the African diaspora, in his sophomore year. Now the president of the group, he said that his experiences with Kuumba have extended beyond the purely musical to include explorations of identity and history. One of his most important memories with the group is of their spring 2015 tour, during which the singers visited the historically black Rust College in Mississippi, whose campus includes a site formerly used for slave auctions. “We sang, I want to say it was ‘Hold On.’ And ‘Hold On’ is a song that’s basically exactly what it says, it’s a spiritual that says, ‘Hold on just a little while longer, everything will be all right,’” he said. “And you’re singing that at this slave auction block, at this historically black college, with a crowd of primarily black students, and it just had a lot of meaning.”
Brophy said that one of the key goals of her tenure as president of HRDC has been to increase the diversity of narratives represented in Harvard theater. She emphasized that students of color looking to be involved in theater may face higher barriers to entry than white students. “I think that there’s a lot of pressure for people of color to always be representing not just themselves but generally communities of color,” she said.
She said that she has worked to increase collaboration between HRDC and more culturally-specific theater groups such as the Harvard Black Community and Student Theater Group, or BlackC.A.S.T., and TEATRO!, the Latino student theater group that restarted this year after a four-year hiatus. “We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how we can best try to reach out to the largest array of people,” she said. “We obviously don’t want it to come off as being very tokenizing, like, ‘Come tell your story,’ but we want to make sure that all people feel welcome to come into our community.”
This fall, O’Connor directed TEATRO!’s first show after its revival, “Nuestra Señora de las Nubes,” a play by contemporary Argentinian playwright Arístides Vargas that focuses on experiences of exile in Latin America. “It felt very personal to me, just because being part Ecuadorian and being an Ecuadorian citizen, I felt like it spoke to a lot of underrepresented voices that exist not within… the Latinx community at large here on campus,” he said. “The play deals with the exiles that a lot of people’s families went through... also just the general immigrant experience that a lot of people feel and that their families have gone through or that they themselves have gone through.”
O’Connor said that for him, casting the show with entirely Latino actors was essential. “Just because the themes were so rooted in that identity and that experience, it would have felt strange and inappropriate, borderline unacceptable, to have non-Latinx people playing [the roles],” he said. “They were able to bring their own lives into the text and really enhance the experience and make it more real for the people who were watching it. They really cared, because in part they were acting out pieces of their own lives.”
Other culturally-specific arts extracurriculars, however, look to attract students regardless of ethnicity or background. Kuumba, for example, is a non-audition group, as are the Asian American Dance Troupe and Ghungroo, the annual South Asian music and dance performance.
Dong, a co-captain of AADT, said that this inclusivity is an essential part of what drew her to the group. “I think on a campus like Harvard’s everyone is always super competitive, and they almost always exclusively do the things that they’ve done forever and they know they can do and are good at,” she said. “AADT, on the other hand—the majority, maybe 70 to 90 percent of AADT, are students who have never danced before college. It’s a very different atmosphere, where the people are just there really to learn a completely new skill set and to really have fun.”
Raj Vatsa ’18, an applied mathematics concentrator and one of the directors for this year’s Ghungroo, expressed similar feelings about including students from any background. “[Ghungroo] is very much South Asian, with South Asian dances and music, but the diversity of students that you end up seeing onstage is, for me, super exciting,” he said. “I came from a high school where I was one of three or four South Asian people there, and to come to a place where [people from] so many different cultures are celebrating the South Asian arts was awesome.”
For many students and faculty thinking about the intersection of the arts with issues of diversity and inclusivity, the stakes have rarely seemed so high. After an election that for many seemed to herald a resurgence of racism and xenophobia, students and faculty say that making the arts a space for dialogue has become more important than ever.
Many arts organizations on campus created opportunities for students to process the results of the election. “Kuumba opened itself up to be a space for reflection for people about the election,” Boyland said. “So for a lot of people, that can be a space of healing and catharsis.” According to O’Connor, TEATRO! also helped host a reflection event.
Many of those interviewed also emphasized the role that the arts can play in shaping national conversations about citizenship. “Whatever one thinks of immigration policy, there’s no need to demonize people,” Megan said. “So I think this issue of how the arts reflect who we are and promote inclusion or belonging is more important than ever.”
Clark expressed similar hopes. “The humanities teach you how to ask questions and to think from different points of view,” she said. “I think that what has been happening recently on the world stage is that people are not thinking about different points of view.”
Lambert-Beatty emphasized the importance of the arts in any reckoning with exclusion in American political, social, and cultural life. “I think that these are topics that can be dealt with in the language of policy and can be dealt with in the language of social science, and have to be, but that they are issues of the psyche, of culture at a level that’s not always apparent to us on the surface as we live it,” she said. “It necessitates the examination of all of the assumptions that we carry, and art is constantly bringing [these issues] up and letting us see them and giving us other ways to approach them.”
She added that the arts can also create opportunities for the imagination of alternatives to dominant cultural and political realities. “Art generates the possible, and that’s why it’s so important to have lots of different people generating the possible from lots of different perspectives,” she said.
For Lewis too, inclusivity is an imperative. “Part of what should give us a sense of the urgency of this topic—of dealing with inclusivity, of dealing with race and the arts—is that we’re dealing with a topic that shouldn’t have any barrier for entry,” she said. “We’re dealing with what it means to be creative. We’re dealing with a skill that we’re naturally endowed with at the youngest stage of our development—the ability to invent, to imagine, to dream. If this field does have barrier of entry, out of all fields, if the arts is a field that still needs work to do with inclusion, you know that we really have work to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well, this is not the end-of-semester column I expected to write.
In September—or even when I published my last column, early Nov. 8—I thought I’d be writing a Trump retrospective. What could we learn about our country and ourselves through Trump’s rise and fall? How could we prevent the rise of a future “clean Trump,” the extremist without such obvious personal flaws—without the Twitter insults, the business scams, the infidelities, the shameless disregard for the importance of the office—who could actually win?
If a few state lines had been drawn a bit differently, I’d be asking those questions.
Like many of my classmates, I wandered campus pretty shell-shocked the day after the election. The country—no, not the country, but 46.1 percent, a large enough minority to carry someone to the White House—had rejected what we had taken for granted in the Obama years: the slow-but-sure march of social progress, the most basic respect for political opponents and the institutions of civic life.
What rocked me to my core, though, and what I think really devastated everyone’s inner student—constantly self-challenging truth-seekers that we ideally are—was that Trump’s win represented a triumph of bullshit. Forty-six percent of Americans bought a compellingly presented narrative that relied almost entirely on utter garbage: America had less growth (true, kinda) and security (completely false) than it used to; this decline was attributable to waves of immigration across our southern border (false in both incidence and causality) and to internationalism (trickier, but the economic benefits to free trade are incredibly well-established); and finally that Trump alone could solve these problems because he, unlike all of his competitors, was not beholden to the elite establishment (to which he, undoubtedly and by his own account, belongs). His case also depended on contradictions, like that Hillary Clinton’s rule-breaking made her irredeemably crooked, but his “made [him] smart.” But 63 million voters, presumably mostly rational, kind people in their private lives, believed it enough to pick him over Clinton.
So now we must grapple with more urgent questions than the above hypotheticals. How can we mitigate the damage to human rights, to the climate, to democracy in the next four years? How can (small-L) liberal (small-D) democrats win elections when authoritarianism clearly appeals to so many? And insofar as doing so protects humanity, how can we fight for facts in our politics?
First, we need to understand how Trump won.
We can't solely attribute his victory to the white supremacists he attracted and failed to condemn, nor the sexists who excused his misogyny. He also won the votes of tens of thousands of people—moderates—in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin who voted for Obama twice; many switched allegiances in spite of his antagonizing, not because of it.
Hillary Clinton’s economic plan, with its lower-income tax breaks, job retraining, and public infrastructure investment, addressed their needs far better than Trump’s supply-side cronyism, but should we really expect people to read platforms? Seriously! People have jobs, kids, marriages, millions of things they’d rather do than familiarize themselves with position papers. They watch television. They surf social media. They learn about candidates first through ethos and then through messaging.
Clinton’s messaging, down to her slogan, “Stronger Together,” emphasized diversity, cultural politics, and Trump’s supposedly fundamental un-Americanness. Trump promised to revitalize manufacturing and, as a result, the Rust Belt. Whether or not he can, he recognized their grievances as legitimate. He convinced them, like Obama did in 2012, that he was on their side and his opponent was not.
If you lived in Detroit, or Cleveland, or Youngstown, or Erie, or Flint, how badly would you want to believe that your hometown, decimated by automation and maybe also free trade, could come roaring back? The idea that coastal elites have sold you out might make sense, when their economies have fully recovered and your city’s population has halved. Truly consider: How alluring would Clinton’s narrative have been, that Trump was just exaggerating America’s problems, that we were “already great,” that Trump would have represented a dangerous jolt to the status quo?
This column has previously explored how the ways we process information, in this age of overwhelming data, affect our politics. We think about politically loaded terms like “change,” which is of course neither inherently good or bad, emotionally and sometimes irrationally. We flock more to individuals than to arguments, to narrative more than point-by-point refutation.
How can liberals win? By campaigning to people as they are, not as they “should be.” Look at the last 10 years: They won marriage equality, according to a persuasive article in the Atlantic by Molly Ball, when they shifted their arguments from abstract rights-based arguments to appeals to love and family. They won in 2008 and 2012 not because Obama was more qualified but because he was an agent of change and, then, a middle-class warrior. They won on the strength of narrative.
The battlefield for the next several years is not the ballot box but the legal system, Congress, and public opinion. The president-elect will continue to lie, to make claims like, “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions who voted illegally.” We must not waste our time furiously debunking every falsehood. We must offer a better vision for the country—one that does not ask people to hate their neighbors, to excuse rape, to follow one clownish man who says he can do it alone.
Hannah Arendt writes in “The Origin of Totalitarianism” that the “chief disability” of political lies is that, well, they aren’t true. They “cannot fulfill this longing of the masses for a completely consistent, comprehensible, and predictable world without seriously conflicting with common sense.” In a world swimming with falsehood—likely soon to include official propaganda—we can still hope that the facts will, in the end, prevail. We just have to tell the right story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s abrupt decision this past May to sanction unrecognized single-gender social organizations beginning in 2017 has been a point of contention among not just students, but also faculty members. While University President Drew Faust deemed all unrecognized single-gender social organizations “at odds with [the College’s] deepest values” and decided to sanction their future members, some Harvard faculty have disagreed with this sweeping punishment, ultimately drafting a motion declaring that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of the organizations they join,” which they argue will repeal the sanctions if it is passed. After months of anticipation, the motion was finally formally presented at the faculty meeting on Tuesday. Nevertheless, after impassioned argumentation on both sides and a motion by the docket committee to indefinitely postpone the vote—which would effectively kill the measure—the meeting was ultimately adjourned without the expected vote.
While we certainly acknowledge that the postponement the faculty vote is neither useful nor productive, we are primarily concerned with the way that Professor Harry Lewis, one of the most outspoken faculty members against the sanctions, framed the motion at the faculty meeting itself. His remarks, which were posted onto his personal blog, are framed in a disconcerting manner. For instance, Lewis draws a parallel between discrimination on the basis of race and discrimination on the basis of belonging to a club. Insinuating that these types of discrimination are at all equivalent is troubling, distasteful, and illogical; students exercise no control over their particular race, whereas students who voluntarily join single-gender social organizations under the sanctions willingly accept whatever consequences that may entail. In addition, the wording is such that we cannot support it. The language does not explicitly address the sanctions directly and makes a tautological argument that discrimination against those who discriminate is discrimination.
Additionally, Lewis and others have claimed the sanctions themselves are unconstitutional on the basis of preventing freedom of association. However, we are skeptical about the validity of this argument. Even though implementing the sanctions effectively bars students from joining unrecognized single-gender social organizations, the bar of prevention should be higher than legality. For the same reasons that Harvard administrators can and should prevent students from joining an alt-right or white supremacist club on campus, they can prevent students from joining unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Moreover, we believe that the way the motion was presented at the faculty meeting overlooks that the sanctions affect not just male final clubs, but all unrecognized single-gender social organizations. While Professor Lewis addresses the idea that women who belong to these unrecognized social organizations would be punished most strongly by the sanctions, he does not offer enough detail regarding the nuances between unrecognized male and female social organizations.
In the past, we emphasized that the significant differences between male and female unrecognized social groups merit different treatment, and that a blanket punishment like the sanctions as they currently exist is not the best solution. We still believe this detail is an important one that should be seriously considered in the voting decision. However, despite the clear differences, we recognize that female final clubs and even sororities have their own flaws and problems of exclusivity that can be improved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pond scum taught us more about our brains than generations of research. GOP leadership should learn from it.
In 2002, researchers from the University of Texas submitted a grant proposal for “Rhodopsin Signaling in a Model Eucaryotic [sic] Microorganism.” The proposal passed the stringent grant proposal review process at the National Science Foundation and was fully funded.
If the proposal had been submitted today, however, under a title closer to that of the final paper, it’s likely a quick Google search for “phototaxis” would have landed it on the chopping block of every vigilant government-spending “watchdog” out there.
I mean, we’re talking about allocating $261,001 to fund to study the way pond scum move towards light.
Yet, the study of this green algae and its receptors that allow for such movement towards light changed neuroscience more than, arguably, any single discovery in recent history. It was the discovery of a channelrhodopsin, a light-sensitive protein in the receptors, that has fueled this revolution. Channelrhodopsins specifically are ion channels that “open” when light hits them, thus causing the neurons they are found in to fire.
From here, it was a short jump to developing methods to carry these channelrhodopsins into specific neurons, allowing researchers to “turn on” precise neurons using light. This method, known as optogenetics, has led to advances in our understanding of memory, addiction, disorders such as OCD and anxiety, diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and other open questions in neuroscience.
These findings are a testament to not only the power of good science, but also the power of experts managing good science. A cursory view of the study by non-experts would not have seen the 40 years of research that laid the foundation for it, the potential future applications, or what the experts in the field found inherently valuable in it: that it may further our knowledge of the world, whether or not it had obvious applications.
However, Lamar Smith and other congressional “watchdogs” think that they know better. Smith, a Christian Scientist (not to be confused with a Christian scientist), has served as the Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee since 2013.
That same year, Smith started investigating the NSF’s grant award process based on his interpretation of what should qualify as relevant science. More recently, he placed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under subpoena for publishing a scientifically accurate paper that he believed, in his personal opinion, to be false. Given his recent re-election to the chairmanship, we can expect such efforts to continue under a Trump presidency, especially with regard to NSF funding.
The NSF grant review process generally takes over half a year and is one of the most thorough systems for scientific funding in the world. Proposals undergo several levels of review before they are approved or denied.
This process, however, is not enough for Smith. He repeatedly calls for increased levels of congressional intrusion in the NSF, justified by his interpretation of titles of funded proposals. Yet, the fact remains that Lamar Smith is not, nor has ever been, a scientist in any fields concerned with his multiple “audits.”
France Córdova, current Director of the NSF, has, under these audits, worked with congressional leadership to improve transparency and open communication while still preserving the integrity, efficiency, and autonomy of the NSF’s processes. Although, by statute, her term as NSF Director would expire in 2020, the statute also stipulates she could be removed by the President at any time, and President-elect Trump has shown a willingness to break with convention when it comes to appointments. Without a champion, the NSF’s rigorous, expert-driven processes may well give way to a process driven by burdensome, politicized bureaucracy.
Ultimately, calls for “more transparency” lead us to two major issues. First, the already robust, difficult, and extensive grant proposal process will become more difficult, more extensive, and not any more robust. Second, non-technical explanations of research will be further used to bolster arguments against valid scientific research, as Smith has already done.
The latter issue is the more unexpected of the two—it seems logical that taxpayers and congressional leaders like Rand Paul and Smith should have all the details about NSF spending. This conclusion, however, is ill-founded. It relies upon the assumption that each grant proposal stands alone, as an island, unrelated to broader fields of inquiry. Such a view of science is what leads to calls for more applied research and less basic research. It is a misplaced belief that science is like building a tower one floor at a time—that each discovery will beget implementable results.
However, this is not science. Science is a sprawling, interlocked web of ideas. It doubles back on itself. It hits dead ends. But sometimes, importantly, it connects two paths that never were thought to be connected. And it is by these connections that we make some of our most groundbreaking discoveries. These are almost always the result of decades of nuanced research that may seem frivolous to someone outside the field. Yet, things are usually not as simple as they seem, especially in the sciences.
Thus we come back to our case study for the necessity of basic science—the optogenetic revolution. Had Smith and others had their way, it’s likely we’d never have optogenetics, nor all of the progress that it has fueled.
In a Politico op-ed, Smith and Paul argue that they are not on a "war against science.” I agree. To be engaged in such a war would require them to holistically understand the scientific process. Instead, they have taken their electoral popularity as a mandate to be citizen-specialists, auditors-in-chief, scientific experts made overnight.
Without an NSF Director willing to push back against overbearing congressional leaders, the mechanism that has created the environment for American scientific advances during the last seventy years will be in jeopardy. In light of this, the scientific community must stand prepared—prepared to oppose more politicized intrusions; prepared to stand tall in the face of scientific illiteracy; prepared to defend itself from the pro-Smith, pro-applied, pro-bureaucracy movement within the GOP’s leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, a World War II and Korean War veteran, Navy test pilot, and United States Senator for a tenure of 24 years, died on Thursday. He was 95.
As a native Ohioan, I grew up admiring John Glenn. Glenn achieved an almost mythically larger-than-life status in American culture when he returned from space in 1962. From his journey in orbit on, Glenn continued to make Ohio and the United States proud. Both because of his incredible achievements and the way he handled himself with humility and plain-spoken grace, Glenn was an ideal role model.
He embodied so many characteristics teachers and parents want young people to learn about—and he was a homegrown legend. Having studied history for the last four years, my perspective on why John Glenn is a hero has changed. My conviction that Glenn’s legacy is important and my belief in the inspirational power of his life story, however, is unaltered.
Glenn was a lionhearted warrior, an undaunted explorer, and a judicious statesman. He was a hero in traditional modes perhaps unrivaled by any American in the last century. Tom Wolfe wrote that he was “the last true national hero America has ever had.”
He was admired by President Kennedy and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, by President Obama. To use another of Wolfe’s phrases, he simply had “the right stuff.” Americans could believe in John Glenn.
It’s hard to feel idealistic admiration for public figures today. The “Great Man” theory of history has fallen out of favor, and with good reason. The truth is the United States did not win the space race because of John Glenn alone. An uncountable number of people contributed to his accomplishments. He was, as we all are, a flawed human being. He lost two races for the Presidency. But John Glenn was a hero.
For 75 years, from the time he dropped out of college to enlist in the military until his death, John Glenn was a public servant. He was a fighter pilot in two wars, then a Navy and Marine test pilot, before being selected as one of the original “Mercury Seven” astronauts. His famous orbit of earth was the culmination of twenty years of extraordinary feats of daring.
Glenn announced he would run for the Senate the day he retired from NASA in 1964, though he wasn’t elected until 1974. In 1998, while still a sitting Senator, he returned to space at age 77, the oldest person ever to do so. After officially retiring from the Senate, he helped found the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy (now the John Glenn College of Public Affairs) at The Ohio State University where he taught. He continued to give lectures and visit schools, including my elementary school, until the end of his life.
John Glenn had one of the most impressive resumes in history. But accomplishments and accolades aside, the sheer immensity of Glenn’s devotion to others—whether measured in time, energy, or personal risk—was itself heroic.
In this winter of discontent and divisiveness, Glenn’s passing is a reminder that an optimistic vision of America is possible. Without turning Glenn into a marble demigod or valorizing the cultural milieu from which he came, for that we be dishonest and a disservice to the man, I admire his human courage and his unwavering commitment to causes greater than himself. I respect the way he used his celebrity to create a platform from which he could unselfishly multiply his ability to do good.
And I try to remember, without having lived through his most historic accomplishments myself, what it was like to be inspired by a humble individual who dared to test the limits of possibility.

Over the summer, Harvard University Health Services' after-hours urgent care clinic moved from the Smith Campus Center to its current temporary location in the Law School's Pound Hall.
Despite the move, the urgent care center has received a number of visits comparable to last year. However, administrators say they continue to worry about the current location’s accessibility to students since its relocation in June.
The relocation is a result of ongoing construction to the Smith Campus Center, which administrators said could cut off utilities in the building after regular business hours.
“Having after-hours urgent care [at Pound Hall] is a constant concern, in terms of setting up a barrier that might prevent students who are either physically ill, mentally ill, or drunk—who don’t get there when they should get there,” HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira said.
This academic year, the number of after-hours urgent care visits on nights, weekends, and holidays at Pound Hall has remained relatively unchanged from last year when it was located in the Smith Campus Center, according to data provided by HUHS. In total, 3,298 Harvard affiliates visited the after-hours clinic between Aug. 23 and Nov. 30, from the beginning of freshman orientation through the end of fall classes. Undergraduate visits totaled 1,606.
Last fall, during a similar period spanning the fall semester, HUHS recorded 3,324 urgent care visits outside of normal hours, 1,739 of which were by College students.
While the data may suggest the relocation has had a minimal impact, Barreira said HUHS has received concerns from individual students, the Freshman Dean’s Office, and House staff about the difficulty of locating Pound Hall—especially at night. He said HUHS administrators had heard of instances in which students used Uber, the ride-sharing mobile app, to get to the clinic.
“What we have to reconcile is the individual experience and group data,” Barreira said. “I’m gratified that the numbers have looked close to the same in this site, but I’m also mindful that students are reporting they find a barrier.”
Maria Francesconi, director of HUHS Health Promotion and Education, agreed.
“Our numbers may look the same, but the experience of getting to it is going to be so different,” she said.
In response, HUHS has tried to improve signage around Harvard Yard and information on its website for students, including photos that show the entrance and maps with the building’s location.
“When they have to go over there at night, they don’t know the space over there,” Barreira said. “The building is not easy to recognize; the entrance to it is even more difficult.”
HUHS chose Pound Hall—which is also the Law School’s daytime HUHS clinic—as the location for after-hours urgent care because of its close proximity to the College’s student body and because the building already possessed a license from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
Barreira said the Smith Campus Center construction has disrupted HUHS operations beyond the relocation of urgent care services. Some of its administrative resources have had to move to other University buildings, and the Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors, a College peer counseling group, was displaced from its office, as well.
“Construction is a huge, huge issue in ways that you see and don’t see,” Barreira said. “The one you see is urgent care.”
Barreira confirmed that HUHS intends to move after-hours urgent care back to the Smith Campus Center when construction is completed in the fall of 2018.
HUHS after-hours urgent care in Pound Hall is open from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. on weekdays and 24 hours on weekends and holidays.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton weren’t the only candidates pouring money into their presidential campaigns this year.
Four tickets vying to serve as next year’s Undergraduate Council president and vice president spent a total of $649.52 over the course of the UC’s 10-day campaign, according to expenditure reports submitted by the candidates to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
For this year’s UC campaign, the majority of funds were spent on printing posters and letters, hosting websites, and boosting Facebook posts.
Four tickets ran for the UC presidency and vice presidency this year: Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and Alex Popovski ’19, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, and Grant S. Solomon ’18 and Alexander T. Moore ’18. Sachee and Khansarinia ultimately won the election, and were sworn in as the UC’s new leaders earlier this week.
This year, each ticket was allowed spend up to $200 on the campaign, according to UC Election Commission rules. Candidates could be reimbursed  for their expenses up to the $200 limit, if they submitted receipts to this year’s UC treasurer, Samarth Gupta ’18.
Each ticket other than Solomon and Moore’s spent more than $160 of their allotted $200 spending cap. Solomon and Moore—the only ticket to feature candidates who had not previously served on the Council—spent just $89 on their campaign.

Sachee and Khansarinia’s campaign spent significantly less than Ely and Bonsall or Gonzalez and Moore on printing costs, and also were the only candidates to advertise themselves on Snapchat.
Their ticket spent $54.23 on two different Snapchat filters that appeared in various locations on campus—including Annenberg, Lamont Library, and several upperclassman Houses and freshman dorms—during the campaign. Solomon and Moore used Twitter as a campaign platform as well, though they did not spend any campaign funds on the social networking site.
Printing—for posters or paper messages delivered to dorm rooms—was the largest spending category across the campaign, accounting for 29.6 percent of total expenditures. Candidates spent a total of $192.50 on printing costs. Solomon and Moore were the only ticket not to spend campaign money on printing.

Websites accounted for the next largest spending category, with $104.80 spent across all campaigns. All four tickets had websites during the campaign advertising their platforms, and they also maintained Facebook pages.
Three campaigns—all but Ely and Bonsall’s—spent funds on boosting advertisements of their tickets on Facebook. Facebook post boosting allows a page’s posts to appear higher in users’ news feeds, helping the post to reach a wider audience.
Combined, the three tickets spent $104 to fund Facebook post boosting.

Solomon and Moore spent $52 on Facebook post boosting, accounting for 59 percent of their ticket’s total expenses. Meanwhile, Gonzalez and Popovski’s ticket and Sachee and Khansarinia’s ticket each spent just under 15 percent of their total expenses on Facebook post boosting—Gonzalez and Popovski spent $28 on Facebook, while Sachee and Khansarinia spent $24.
Candidates also spent campaign funds on envelopes, posters, puzzle pieces, stickers, and tape.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor Homi Bhabha, director of Harvard's Mahindra Humanities Center, rejects the idea that the center should only focus on pursuits that have traditionally been considered within the realm of the humanities: literature, art, and their related fields.
Instead, he said he strives to incorporate a multifaceted, interdisciplinary approach to the center’s pursuits, and to involve students and faculty members with a wide variety of expertise.
“Amongst ourselves, it’s not a humanities center,” he said. “It’s a crossroads of views, it’s a crossroads of beliefs, it’s a crossroads of faculty coming to us.”
This idea of a “crossroads” encapsulates Bhabha’s efforts to expand the scope of the material the Mahindra Center promotes discussion on.
As director, Bhabha has supported efforts to adopt an interdisciplinary approach, to bring together Harvard affiliates with different interests and backgrounds, and to make the humanities relevant to current events.
MIXING DISCIPLINES
Comparative Literature professor William M. Todd said the overall impact of the Humanities Center is “bringing to the discussion the subject of perspectives from a variety of disciplines.”
Bhabha believes that the Mahindra Center’s goal is to offer perspectives that extend beyond traditionally humanistic approaches.
“We also believe in thinking about history and architecture or the humanities and medicine or the question of mass incarceration and the concept of mercy,” Bhabha said. “So to bring in these different worlds, to make new constellations by bringing in different and often very diverse disciplinary worlds is something that we’ve been trying to do here.”
To describe the impact of these perspectives from “different worlds,” Bhabha said, “Your focus shifts from wanting to center yourself in any one discipline to trying to explore other worlds, other ideas and other visions from across the campus.”
As an example of the interdisciplinary activities the Mahindra Center hosts, Todd described a panel discussion about shame of which he was a participant.
Todd spoke about a paper on shame in Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky’s works while Psychology professor Steven Pinker presented an article from a psychological point of view. In addition, Indo-Tibetan studies professor Robert Thurman from Columbia talked about shame in a religious context.
Moreover, Todd said the Mahindra Center has facilitated connections between people of various departments.
“It does really interesting work, and it’s [working with the Mahindra Center is] a good way to get to meet your colleagues across departmental boundaries,” Todd said.
Bhabha said his implementation of the faculty lunches where faculty across campus convene has been “one of our most successful events.”
Regarding faculty lunches, Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey said the faculty lunches have had a “tremendous effect” on him. According to Kelsey, faculty members who work in the humanities at Harvard or in related fields make an appearance at the humanities center over lunch and share some of their work with their colleagues.
“It’s hard to think of another initiative that’s done more to connect incoming faculty members to their colleagues across Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the University than the faculty lunches,” Kelsey said.
Comparative Literature department chair David Damrosch said Bhabha has been influential in creating this interdisciplinary approach.
“Homi’s been very much interested in reaching out and building bridges between the humanities and other parts of the University, other perspectives,” he said.
‘READY FOR ACTION’
The Mahindra Center is also studying current events under Bhabha’s leadership. Bhabha said he believes that, in order to conduct these explorations, the center must approach them from a variety of cultural perspectives.
Comparative Literature lecturer Cécile Guédon said that she appreciated that the center provided a forum to discuss current events.
“It’s been around for some time, and it also finds us ready for action when the times ask and demand for it. And that’s a wonderful thing,” she said. “I think it needs to be underlined.”
History professor Sugata Bose explained that, under Bhabha’s leadership, the Mahindra Center has studied cultures that humanities centers do not usually explore, such as South Asia.
In 2011, the Mahindra Center invited Jim Scott, a professor at Yale who has studied Burma, to give a series of talks called the Tanner Lectures.
“We often don’t think of these places when we want to promote the humanities, but that has been done under the leadership of professor Bhabha,” Bose said.
Executive Director of the Center Steven Biel and Bhabha said the Mahindra Center does not just analyze ongoing issues like migration.
“We tend to respond quickly to short-term issues but deliberate on long-standing issues which have an ongoing history,” Bhabha said.
One of these “short-term issues” that the center addressed was last month’s presidential election. The day after the election, the Mahindra Center held an event called “Dark and Stormy” to discuss why President-elect Donald Trump won.
This panel was an example of a “newsflash,” an effort, started by Biel, to hold events to respond to these “short-term issues.”
Guédon praised the Mahindra Center for offering the Dark and Stormy panel.
“I think it’s admirable that we found tools already ready for action when the moment seized us,” she said.
The Mahindra Center is also focused on longer-term trends. For example, Bhabha is studying the experience of minority groups within countries.
“I think he has done extraordinarily well in highlighting what could be termed minority cultures which often get a short shrift because majorities dominate within nation states but minoritarian cultures are extremely important,” Bose said.
Bhabha said that his own scholarly background influenced the Mahindra Center’s focus on minority cultures. He said that he has studied “how the experience of minoritization... in general can make us question some of the norms and values that we take for granted.”
Bhabha believes that this approach allows the Mahindra Center to analyze and respond to current issues.
“In a time of often diverse and conflicting views, the role of the humanities center is to provide a platform for courageous and civil discourse,” he said.
Through a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Center offers a seminar to its postdoctoral fellows. This year is marks the end of a seminar on violence and nonviolence, and starting next year, the Center will address the issue of migration.
“It partly relates to what we have been doing in the past three years but in many ways it also responds to the great migration crisis that we have been witnessing,” Bhabha said.
Bhabha added that the group would also consider the practical effects of migration.
“Migration also has a connection to questions of citizenship and refugees, migration also connects to urban issues, where do you settle people who are migrants, migration connects to health issues, economic issues,” he said. “We tend to take issues of this kind and see what kind of contribution the humanities can make to them.”
BUILDING BRIDGES
Under Bhabha’s leadership, the Mahindra Center has helped bring together various branches of Harvard that would otherwise remain disparate.
According to Bhabha, his attempts to bring together a “community” at the Mahindra Center are necessary because we are “in an era in which the place of the humanities in the university at large is less self-evident.”
One of the many ways the Mahindra Center unites the University is by providing a space for students from Harvard's various schools to convene.
The Mahindra Center “reaches out to people in the Law School, the Medical School in particular, and has lectures, seminars, round tables which treat subjects which could be of interest to both communities,” according to Todd.
He added that these events often deal with “ethical problems, political problems, things which can be reflected upon philosophically… Remember these cross-school initiatives really remind us of the potential breadth of the humanities.”
Biology professor Steven E. Hyman said a sense of camaraderie is fostered through conversation and dialogue at the center.
“It’s a very wonderful open set of discussions partly because of the diversity of the scholars who came to the Mahindra and participated,” he said in describing the Mahindra’s lecture series.
Center affiliates also say they hope to encourage more undergraduate students to attend the events.
“I also want to work with Homi to ensure that everyone working in the humanities including our undergraduates feels that the Mahindra Center is a key location for them,” said Kelsey, who works on shaping policy and programming at the Mahindra Center.
“I think the humanities center previously had been oriented very much towards faculty and graduate students and probably more towards literary and cultural theory of a somewhat high order kind,” Damrosch said. “I think that Homi’s very interested in bringing this out into the world of campus.”
Government professor Michael J. Sandel commented on why Bhabha’s efforts to bring together different scholars have resulted in interdisciplinary dialogue.
“The secret to his success?” he said. “Homi does not colonize foreign places and disciplines, but offers an intellectual hospitality that makes engaging with the humanities, and with him, utterly irresistible."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final vote tally that will determine whether Harvard’s graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants unionize may be delayed further if the number of challenge ballots requiring review remains larger than the margin necessary to decide the vote’s outcome. 
Harvard officials and graduate student organizers will meet again on Dec. 19 at the National Labor Relations Board’s Boston office to continue sifting through challenge ballots from November’s vote. According to a Dec. 8 email signed by Harvard's Director of the Office of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran and sent to eligible student voters, the parties will finish working through challenge ballots that day.
The final vote count itself could also begin Dec. 19 if there is enough time following the completion of the challenge ballots’ review. NLRB deputy regional attorney Robert P. Redbord said officials prefer to begin and end a count on the same day for logistical reasons. Therefore, ballot boxes have remained sealed.
If there is not enough time to go through all the challenge ballots on Dec. 19, the final count will begin Dec. 22, according to Curran’s email.
However, the upcoming vote count might not decide whether the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers becomes a union representing approximately 3,500 eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching staff, because some ballots might remain under challenge after the vote count, according to Curran’s email.
“If the election is decided by a margin smaller than the number of ballots still under challenge, the NLRB will set a date for a hearing to determine whether these remaining ballots should be counted,” Curran wrote.
The sheer number of challenges—an estimated 1,000—has delayed the vote count thus far. Some ballots were challenged merely due to a student voting at an unassigned location, while others were set aside for more complex reasons, such as Ph.D. students who voted while not being currently on the payroll but who have been employed by the University for at least one semester in the past year.
Harvard and union organizers stipulated in the election agreement that these students could vote under challenge because the language of the August NLRB decision did not specify their eligibility.
“Our position has always been that doctoral students who have worked in the past and have an expectation to work again should be eligible,” HGSU-UAW organizer and Ph.D. student Sam S. Klug said. “We’re really just doing research to make sure that we have the information that we need regarding people’s working status basically to make sure that the process follows the election agreement and is fair.”
The parties have been working through challenge ballots one-by-one to determine which ones should be counted. Eligible graduate and undergraduate students cast votes on whether or not to form a union on Nov. 16 and 17.
Curran also made clear that the University does not want to delay the count process.
“While we know that many students will be away for winter break at this time, the University agrees with the NLRB that the vote count should proceed without delay once the challenges have been addressed,” Curran wrote.

The committee tasked with implementing the College’s new policy penalizing members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations is on track to meet its deadline to offer recommendations to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana next semester.
“Each sub-committee is preparing to share their initial recommendations with the Steering Committee, which will help inform the Committee’s final recommendations,” College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email.
The implementation committee, whose full membership was announced Oct. 31, is comprised of a steering committee and three sub-groups: “Governance and Implementation,” “Social Groups and Campus Community,” and “Communications and Benchmarking.”
Members of subcommittees have met with student group leaders, fellowship recipients, and varsity athletes over the course of the past month to discuss how the policy could affect these different groups and inform their own recommendations to the steering committee.
The steering committee—which is chaired by Douglas Melton, a faculty dean of Eliot House and a University professor, and Kay K. Shelemay, a professor in the Music and the African and African American Studies departments—establishes and guides the work of the subcommittees and will ultimately make recommendations to Khurana about the extensive logistics of implementing the new policy and recommending methods for enforcement. Faculty members and students sit on the steering committee.
While the subcommittees are preparing to provide initial recommendations to the steering committee, Shelemay wrote in an email that the larger implementation committee has “not completed our deliberations yet.”
Last spring, Harvard administrators announced an unprecedented policy that will ban members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from becoming leaders of recognized student organizations, varsity team captains, or recipients of top College-endorsed fellowships, starting with the Class of 2021.
The committee’s work in implementing the policy continues amid criticism from alumni, faculty, and students.
Prominent former administrators, national media outlets, and hundreds of women have been vocal in their opposition to the College’s policy, though members of the Harvard Corporation, various students, and varsity coaches have expressed support.
In particular, a motion presented by Harry R. Lewis ’68 at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting—stating “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join”—has cast the committee’s work in uncertainty. He believes a vote in favor of the motion will overturn the policy, while the motion’s opponents argue the policy is set in stone.
Tuesday’s meeting was adjourned before the motion could be put to a Faculty vote, with discussion of the legislation tabled until the next full meeting of the Faculty in February. In the past, University President Drew G. Faust has not specified what effect, if any, a Faculty vote in favor of Lewis’s motion would have on the implementation of sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For several months during her freshman and sophomore years of high school in Portland, Ore., Nadya Okamoto ’20 was legally homeless.
Yet, Okamoto still attended school, traveling four hours every day to pursue her education. During the course of her commutes, she developed friendships with other homeless women who lived in shelters along her route.
Through these relationships, Okamoto began to learn more about health issues facing homeless women. Handling menstruation, she soon found, is one of the foremost challenges.

“When I was 16, I was in a very abusive relationship. I hid it from my mom by going to a battered women’s shelter when I had bruises. So it was there that I really connected with more women and heard about how periods were one of the biggest challenges they faced,” Okamoto said.
“I collected stories in my journal,” she added. “They were using toilet paper and grocery bags and, most commonly, stolen pillowcases; anything they could find that could absorb menstrual blood.”
After she regained stable housing, Okamoto established Camions of Care, a nonprofit start-up that works with other organizations to distribute feminine hygiene products to homeless women around the world.
Since coming to Harvard, Okamato has continued to expand the organization. Her advocacy is part of a larger movement on campus and around the nation to address women’s health and hygiene issues.
Campus Activism
Eudora L. Olsen ’17,  who founded the Hygiene Campaign on campus in 2015, became passionate about women’s hygiene following her enrollment in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies sophomore tutorial.
A pre-med student concentrating in the comparative study of religion, Olsen began examining her feminist readings through a public health lens.
While the adversity facing homeless women regarding menstruation seemed obvious to her, Olsen soon realized the issue has been largely overlooked.
A discussion with her mother on how homeless women address hygiene and menstruation illuminated the issue further.
“I am very lucky to be raised by a very strong, feminist mother, and she was like, ‘In my 60 years, I have never even thought about that [issue],’” Olsen said. “If my own mother is not thinking about this, who else isn’t thinking about this?”
“It’s an uncomfortable issue and I think it’s hard to initiate conversations when there’s immediate discomfort,” Olsen added.
The Hygiene Campaign provides feminine hygiene products to homeless women and raises awareness for women’s public health across the University. Harvard officially recognized the organization this fall.
Before the Hygiene Campaign attained its official status, Olsen collected donations for and distributed tampons and pads to homeless women who did not otherwise have access to these products. She reached out to other schools in the Boston area, including MIT, Boston College, and Northeastern University, where she held weeklong donation events and helped them start their own Hygiene Campaign initiatives.
Since receiving official recognition, the campaign has launched a series of events to increase donations. The organization participated in this year’s [BLANK] Party, which it co-hosted with other women’s groups, and recently held FundRAGER, a party in which guests were asked to donate feminine hygiene products to gain admission. In the days leading up to FundRAGER, the campaign posted videos of members sharing “period confessions” to help destigmatize the subject, according to Emma Y. He ’19, a member of the Hygiene Campaign.
“Through the past two events, we’ve collected $270 in donations, and we just went to Costco and bought  huge packs of tampons and pads and dropped them off at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter,” He said.
“It’s such a silenced issue and the women who suffer most from silenced issues are those who are most vulnerable in our society. That has everything to do with race, economic status, sexuality,” Olsen said.
From Donations to Legislation
Okamoto’s research on feminine hygiene revealed that menstruation poses a major obstacle to school attendance. In some societies where menstruation symbolizes the start of womanhood, girls are forced to drop out of school and marry early.
Okamoto works with Camions of Care co-founder and Operations Director Vincent J. Forand, a freshman at Cornell University, to organize and coordinate over 50 chapters around the world. The chapters are located on both high school and college campuses, and Harvard’s Hygiene Campaign started as a Camions of Care chapter. Four chapters are located overseas in Canada, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Kenya.
Chapters run donation events and give the products they receive to Camions of Care, which redistributes the products to women in need around the world. According to Okamoto, the nonprofit has “addressed” over 48,000 periods in the past two years by working with 45 nonprofit partners in 23 states and 13 countries.
“It’s not actually too hard to keep in contact with Nadya and keep this going,” Forand said. “I believe that this is an issue that everyone is affected by and it’s something that we need to come together if we’re going to have any legislation pass or if we’re going to have any major changes... we need both women and men to feel the same way and be able to add to our cause.”
In addition to her work with Camions of Care, Okamoto is also fighting the stigma against menstruation at the city level in Cambridge with Olsen and the rest of the Hygiene Campaign.
Okamoto and Olsen have worked with Cambridge City Councilwoman Jan Devereux to push for making feminine hygiene products available at no cost in public restrooms throughout Cambridge. Their efforts have culminated in a citywide pilot program that will run on a trial basis until June 30, 2017.
“The Department of Public Works is installing dispensers that supply female hygiene products at bathrooms in each of the five youth centers, the Multi Service Center, and in the bathrooms at City Hall,” a Cambridge policy order dated November 7 and signed by then-Acting City Manager Lisa C. Peterson said.
According to Devereux, who had attended and been involved in Hygiene Campaign events in the past, she approached Peterson personally to push for the program.
“The purpose of the pilot is to be able to report back and say ‘Here are the ways we think we succeeded and here are the ways it didn’t go like we planned,’” Devereux said.
“Hopefully, the honor system will work and it won’t be exorbitant costs. People will express appreciation and it will continue. That’s my hope. We’ll have to see, though,” she added.
Hygiene Campaign members voiced support for the organization’s public initiatives.
“I think an upcoming aspect of the club is a legislative aspect for long-term goals, because ultimately collecting donations is not a sustainable support system for homeless women. In order to address the more systemic issue, you’d have to do that through legislation,” He said.
The Campaign, which has also been in contact with a member of the New York City Council according to He, hopes Cambridge will eventually follow New York City’s precedent. The city recently passed legislation that would provide free pads and tampons in all prisons, public schools, and homeless shelters, making it the first city in the United States to do so.
He described New York City’s measure as a “total game changer.”
“They have some initial statistics for how effective this is in schools—the attendance rate went up after these dispensers were put in place. I don’t think we realized how much of an influence this has on people’s lives,” He said.
Setting an Example for Harvard
Olsen hopes these initiatives and conversations will continue on campus.
“It’s not even about making it into a Harvard issue, but how to lift up the fact that the stigmatization of menstruation affects students here. We don’t have free tampons and pads in any of the College bathrooms and that’s something that really, really needs to change,” Olsen said.
Other college campuses across the United States have launched initiatives to provide free feminine hygiene products to students in restrooms.
Brown University’s Undergraduate Council of Students has recently received attention and praise for providing feminine hygiene products in some restrooms on campus.
According to a press release from UCS President Viet Nguyen,“[s]tarting September 7th, Brown’s Undergraduate Council of Students (UCS) will be providing tampons and sanitary napkins in non-residential women’s, men’s, and gender-inclusive bathrooms across campus. This initiative is a student-run effort.”
The Student Life Committee of Harvard’s Undergraduate Council has also been working on a pilot initiative that would that would provide free tampons in campus buildings. UC Crimson Yard representative Arnav Agrawal ’20 said he hoped increasing the number of feminine hygiene product dispensers around campus would reduce taboos surrounding the topic.
“When we have condom dispensers across campus, it fosters community conversation around safe sex, around consent, around sexually transmitted diseases, and so on and so forth,” Agrawal said. “I believe that by having these dispensers across campus, we can foster similar conversations around menstrual hygiene, around problems people face every day. I think it’ll foster the realization that not all people who identify as women menstruate.”
Olsen also said such stigma is important to combat.
“Even to this day, I think a major barrier even for myself that I’ve struggled with is to get over that very ingrained sense of embarrassment and stigma in my own self and I’m like constantly talking about periods. And I still get like a little bit red or like a little bit uncomfortable,” Olsen said.
“However, I love that discomfort because I think so much of that makes me want to keep talking about it. If I need to get over this, then the world needs to get over this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere’s course Government 1360: “American Public Opinion” is a typical class filled with young and eager undergraduates—but there is at least one exception: Robert “Bob” Karp ’61, who has returned to the College at age 72.
Karp is one of many individuals who audits courses at Harvard through a system in which Harvard affiliates— after obtaining permission from the course’s instructor—can attend a class without receiving grades or actually being enrolled in the University.
The process of being permitted to audit a class, however, is an informal system that varies between each of Harvard’s schools. Because of the ambiguities and inconsistencies, many auditors, and even professors, say they are unsure about how to formally audit a class and act on their own interpretations of the policy.
Inconsistent Requirements
At the College, there are basic requirements for those who wish to audit a course: one must be either a student enrolled in any school of the University, an individual holding a teaching appointment in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, or the spouse of someone with such a teaching appointment.
No official record is kept of past or current auditors of College classes, according to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' website.
However, sometimes potential auditors circumvent the requirements by obtaining permission from the instructor.
Asked whether he requires his auditors to have some connection to the University, Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly said, “No, but often people will volunteer that, and sometimes we have people visiting from other colleges.”
Indeed, Kelly’s criteria for auditing is of his own making.
“My personal view is that I’m happy to have people who want to learn things in the class,” Kelly explained, “as long as it doesn’t affect the experience of the students who are enrolled.”
For Kelly’s courses, the process of obtaining permission is quite simple: “They just ask, and I say yes.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane referred questions on auditing to the FAS website.
The Kennedy School follows a similarly lax procedure for auditing.
“Auditing is an informal process, and it is done independent of the administration,” Ben P. Sunday, a customer service specialist in the Kennedy School’s enrollment services office, said. “You contact the professor directly, and there is no record of your participation at the registrar. It is purely at the discretion of the instructor.”
At the Divinity School, by contrast, there is more formality to the system. According to the Divinity School’s website, anyone from the general public can audit a course as long as they obtain the instructor’s permission, fill out an application, and pay the $550 fee for a one-semester course.
The Divinity School also has a specialized program in which full-time ministers who live within 50 miles of HDS can audit classes at a discounted rate.
A Beloved System
Despite variations across the University’s schools, auditors and professors alike have praised the auditing system.
Karp graduated from Harvard College in 1961 and worked for urban renewal agencies and private development companies before retiring. When he “semi-retired” at age 72, Karp said he wanted to remain active.
Upon retirement, Karp started volunteering through Harvard's Phillips Brooks House Association, tutoring prisoners for the high school equivalency test. While volunteering for PBHA, Karp said he heard he could audit classes free of charge because he is an alumnus.
The first courses Karp audited was about inclusion in the classroom. On the first day of classes, Karp went to the class and asked for the professor’s permission to audit.
“He was very clear that I could audit on the condition that I participate in the class and that I do some of the reading, and I said, ‘That’s fine, that’s why I'm here,’” Karp said.
Karp has been auditing classes for five years now, and is currently enrolled in Ansolabehere’s Government 1360.
“Bob is exactly the sort of auditor I like to have,” Ansolabehere said. “He brings fresh insights and takes the class seriously.”
“The professors make a point of knowing people’s first names,” Karp said. “They made a point of saying that ‘When I ask questions in class and want you to participate they’re not trick questions and I’m not going to put anyone on the spot.’”
Ansolabehere praised the diversity auditors bring to the classroom.
“I encourage the auditors to participate fully,” he said. “They bring different experiences and perspectives.”
Karp said he appreciates school more now that he is older.
“I was sort of casual about going to class, more than casual,” he said. “Now that I’m not paying for it I feel uncomfortable and guilty when I miss a class.”
Despite the popular conception that many auditors are of older age, some undergraduates also take advantage of the chance to audit courses that may fall outside of their main academic interests.
Julia M. Ernst ’18 said she has audited a handful of courses in addition to her regular course load.
“Whenever a friend tells me of a class that they are loving a lot, I tend to go with them,” Ernst said. “I’ve been going to one of my good friend’s poetry classes, and it’s been awesome.”
According to Ernst, in her experience auditing courses, professors have been very welcoming and encouraging of students sitting in on their classes.
“It’s nice to remember that there are so many different areas of study at this school,” Ernst said. “Even if I’m an engineering concentrator… it’s super refreshing getting to participate or even just listen to people talking about poetry or talking about the economics of global health, or whatever subject they’re focusing on.”
Keeping Quiet
Despite praise for the auditing system, the lack of clarity and consistency in rules across the University has deterred some auditors from raising questions about the process.
Although Karp has enjoyed auditing several classes, he said he hopes he is not violating any College rules concerning auditing courses that would prevent him from being able to sit in on classes in the future.
“It’s a great great opportunity to be able to do what I’m doing and I hope I’m not violating any University policy,” he said, adding that the lack of clarity in the system made him nervous. “I’d rather take my chance on forgiveness rather than permission,” Karp said. “I don’t want somebody to say no.”
Ernst voiced similar concerns regarding the lack of clarity in the auditing process. While it is rare for her to ask for permission to audit a large lecture course, Ernst often speaks with the professors of smaller courses she chooses to audit.
“I haven’t actually formally audited a class,” Ernst said, although receiving a professor’s permission to audit his or her course technically, according to the FAS website, is sufficient to formally audit a course.
Ansolabehere acknowledged that there are drawbacks for auditors.
“Auditors typically do not get the full benefit of the course, as participation in projects and writing papers seems necessary to have a complete learning experience,” he said.
Still, the ambiguities implicit in the auditing process has not stopped people like Ernst and Karp from capitalizing on the chance to take Harvard courses free of charge.

UPDATED: December 9, 2016, at 5:10 p.m.
Officials from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation detailed updates to the agency’s plans for straightening a portion of Interstate 90 that will cross Harvard-owned land in Allston during a public meeting Thursday.
The project, projected to cost $260 million, will straighten the Mass. Turnpike over Allston Landing South, a 91-acre parcel of land Harvard purchased from railroad company CSX Transportation in 2003.
The realignment will be accompanied by the erection of West Station, a new commuter rail stop slated to connect Allston to an existing rail line. The process of realignment will not begin until 2018 or 2019, according to Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey. When it was announced in Sept. 2014, the new station was scheduled to open in 2020.
“There’s been a lot of reports in the newspapers, there’s been a lot of reports on social media. I want to make sure that you are fully knowledgeable about this project,” Michael J. O’Dowd, who led the meeting, said in his opening remarks. O’Dowd is a project manager for MassDOT.
One of the major updates to the realignment project involves shifting Soldiers Field Road 100 feet to the south, a move that will enlarge park space along the Charles River between the River Street and Boston University bridges. Many area residents had previously called for the creation of additional parkland.
MassDOT officials said some of the proposed updates to the realignment, including moving Soldiers Field Road, were made possible by an agreement recently reached between Harvard and Bruce E. Houghton, the president of Allston-based industrial company Houghton Chemical. A section of rail yard owned by Houghton’s company complicates the construction of the Turnpike, and had limited MassDOT’s ability to move forward with the project.
Under the terms of the deal struck between Houghton and Harvard, Houghton Chemical will relinquish all rights to its rail siding in two years, and Harvard will provide Houghton with an unspecified amount of money to relocate the rail house.
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident and member of the Turnpike project task force who attended the meeting, said the new park space along the Charles River was “great,” adding that Harvard deserved “big kudos.” He and several other attendees expressed concern, however, over what they said was MassDOT’s failure to update the public on the status of West Station.
“I think MassDOT has created a huge amount of uncertainty about their commitment to building West Station,” Mattison said.
At the meeting, O’Dowd, pressed by attendees to give a specific timeline for the construction of West Station, refused to do so. He emphasized, however, that MassDOT remained committed to the project.
“If the necessary funds are not in place, the decision will need to be made at that point as to what buildings will be constructed ahead of others, but we have not said that West Station will not be built,” he said.
The station’s construction is projected to cost $25 million, and Harvard and the state government have said they will each shoulder a third of the cost. A funding source for the remaining $8 million is still unclear.
MassDOT communications specialist Patrick Marvin said funding for West Station lay “outside the scope” of Tuesday’s meeting.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification: 
CORRECTION: December 9, 2016 
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the I-90 is currently on Harvard-owned land. In fact, the proposed realignment would be located on Harvard land.
CLARIFICATION: December 9, 2016 
A previous version of this article indicated Houghton Chemical had relinquished rights to its railyard property to Harvard. To clarify, Houghton Chemical will relinquish rights to its rail siding .

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undocumented students and activists said they are disappointed by University President Drew G. Faust’s decision not to label Harvard a "sanctuary campus" following the presidential election, although they remain optimistic that many of her proposals to protect undocumented immigrants will make the University similar to such a campus in practice, if not in name.
The “sanctuary campus” title is a relatively new one and mirrors the “sanctuary city” status that several municipalities, including Boston and Cambridge, have adopted. Immediately following Trump’s victory in the election, several institutions, including Wesleyan University and the University of Pennsylvania, labeled themselves as sanctuaries, vowing to protect undocumented students who may be affected by the anti-immigrant policies Trump has promised to enact.
Two weeks ago, Faust sent an email to Harvard affiliates promising her “clear and unequivocal support” for undocumented students, faculty, and staff at the University. In the message, she proposed a number of initiatives, including a “single, University-wide point of connection” for undocumented affiliates seeking resources for immigration concerns. She also clarified that the Harvard University Police Department “is not involved in enforcing federal immigration laws.”
At a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting on Tuesday, Faust joined the presidents of Brown University and Princeton University in declining to adopt sanctuary status, citing a lack of “legal significance” in the term. She also said it "risks drawing special attention to the students in ways that could put their status in greater jeopardy.”
Several undocumented students and organizers who met with Faust two weeks ago called the decision disappointing but unsurprising.
“The term ‘sanctuary campus’ was more symbolism than anything, and during our meeting with Faust, we weighed the costs and benefits of that symbolism,” Paulo J. Pinto ’19, an undocumented immigrant and board member of immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream, said. “She just thought that the costs outweighed the pros.”
Maribel Nava ’20, a member of Act on a Dream and some of whose family members are undocumented, said adopting the sanctuary campus label would have provided “mental security” to those who fear Trump’s immigration policy will harm them.
“We’re doing a lot of things that are happening on sanctuary campuses,” Nava said. “But declaring Harvard a sanctuary would have been such a big moral step.”
Some students questioned the logic behind Faust’s decision. Allyson R. Perez ’17, an organizer with Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard, sharply criticized Faust’s rhetoric, calling the announcement “extremely frustrating.”
Many said the decision is disheartening given the widespread student and faculty support for the protection of undocumented immigrants. A petition authored by Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard gathered more than 4,000 signatures in the week following the presidential election. Hundreds of professors signed a letter urging Faust to champion Harvard’s undocumented students.
Although dissatisfied with Faust’s announcement, several members of Act on a Dream said they are hopeful about other measures the University will take to protect Harvard’s undocumented community, many of which mirror policies adopted by sanctuary campuses.
“The other steps she’s willing to carry out are the same things happening at sanctuary campuses, so taking the name would have been a purely symbolic gesture,” Pinto said.
“All I care about are the practical things, so the symbolism doesn’t really matter to me,” Enrique Ramirez ’17, an undocumented immigrant and board member of Act on a Dream, said. “What really matters is that people are safe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team did not get off to the start it wanted in Wednesday night’s road contest against Kansas. In the first three minutes of the matchup between the Crimson (8-1) and Jayhawks (3-5), it seemed as though the magic that Harvard had at the start of the season had finally run out.
The Crimson had five turnovers to go along with only one attempted and missed shot, and on the other end of the court the Jayhawks would jump out to an 8-0 lead. It looked as though the homecoming for senior guard Grace Keane would not have a happy ending.
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith would call a timeout to regroup and settle her team. The Crimson came out of the timeout looking more poised and would go on to outscore Kansas, 69-51 the rest of the way. The 69-59 victory at Allen Fieldhouse was the team’s eighth consecutive win.
“We’re just really happy,” Delaney-Smith said. “Given the timing of this game, [the game] being on the road, and it being a Big 12 [game]...They had a very good game plan to maximize the pressure, and we weathered the storms.”
Wednesday’s victory was the team’s first victory over a power five conference opponent this season. Despite not having the prestige around its program like the Jayhawks do, Harvard had two options for its trip to Lawrence.
The first was to show up and have a lackluster performance and leave the Sunflower State after a memorable couple of days and having played in one of college basketball’s most historic arenas.  The second was it could fight and prove that the one-loss record was not a fluke.
The Crimson chose the latter.
“Before the game we talked a lot about how we didn’t have anything to lose,” freshman forward Jeannie Boehm said. “We walked into Kansas and you could tell that not a lot of people expected us to win, and so we all had a chip on our shoulders. That was really the focus of the game, to just take it to them, and proving ourselves out there.”
Boehm may have been just another freshman in Kansas’ gameplan, but she played like she had everything to prove. The Winnetka, Ill., native recorded 12 points, five blocks, and 10 rebounds, with four of the boards coming on the offensive end of the floor.
“Great game tonight, really good game tonight,” Delaney-Smith said of her freshman’s play. “Terrific.”
After the Jayhawks jumped out to the 8-0 lead, Harvard finally responded with a three-pointer from freshman guard Katie Benzan.
The first quarter had many inconsistent stretches for the guests, but they would finish the quarter ahead 17-13.
In the second quarter, the Crimson did a better job of finding its stride on the offensive end. Kansas would win the second quarter, aided by four 3-pointers,  but that did not throw Harvard off its game on the other end. Against a streaky shooting, perimeter-oriented team, the best response to the Jayhawks’ shooting was to stick to the game plan.
“You play a team like Kansas, which their players are very athletic,” Delaney-Smith said. “If you isolate, then you’re gonna get yourself in some match-ups that are challenging. We didn’t do that, we played together and played as a team.”
Going into the second half the Crimson were down by only one point, and would eventually reclaim the lead with seven minutes to go in the third quarter.
Harvard did not trail the rest of the contest. The key to success for the Crimson was what Delaney-Smith calls 14-player team basketball.
“We’re working towards being totally unselfish,” Delaney-Smith said. “That it’s a 14-player team win on both ends of the floor. We have kids who can shoot really well; we share the ball really well, which is very important. Defensively, it’s really important that you help your teammate, and that you play like a team.”
Harvard would play like that team. Four of the five starters would score double digit points, and the bench would not only create and capitalize on opportunities on the court, but provided relentless and fiery energy off it.
“If you look at the stat line it’s pretty clear that everybody contributed,” Boehm said. “I think a big part of it was the energy off the bench, players 1-14 really contributed, and it wouldn’t be possible without everybody.”
Going into the fourth quarter, the  freshmen Benzan and Boehm helped seal the deal.
Benzan had two steals, two assists, and a three-pointer while Boehm collected four rebounds and a block in the final frame to put the icing on the cake. The key now for the Crimson is to stay consistent and do what has gotten them to an eight-game long winning streak.
“We don’t change anything,” Delaney-Smith said. “I definitely would say that this win is coming at a good time. We can make sure that everyone stays healthy. Our team has stayed very healthy. Making all the right choices away from practice, eating and sleeping right. This team is committed to doing what they are supposed to do, and that’s what we’ll do during exams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a win at home against Northeastern, the Harvard men’s basketball team traveled to take on local rival Boston College on Wednesday. In a matchup that saw head coach Tommy Amaker become the winningest coach in Harvard men’s basketball history, the Crimson would carry a 16-point first half advantage to down the Eagles, 74-66.
Behind a season-high 22 points from freshman forward Chris Lewis and 18 from classmate Seth Towns, Harvard (4-4) moves to .500 for the first time this season and extended its winning streak to three games.
TAKING THE EARLY LEAD
In a matchup that seemed to follow the script of the Northeastern game the night before, the Crimson got off to a hot start against the Eagles (4-4). After trading baskets early on, the Crimson would go on an 18-5 run in the middle of the first half to take a 15-point lead.
The strong start was spearheaded by a combination of Harvard’s young talent and co-captain Siyani Chambers. 33 of the Crimson’s 46 first half points were scored by three freshmen—Bryce Aiken, Towns, and Lewis. In that same span Chambers would add six assists, four points, and two steals.
While the Crimson has thrived beyond the arc this season, in Wednesday’s game, Harvard took to attacking the basket early and often. The Crimson would outscore BC 20-8 in the paint over the period while taking only eight threes.
After entering the bonus with over ten minutes left on the clock, Harvard would go the line for 10 points to the Eagles’ one in the first half.
“We’re constantly trying to preach, can we set the tone, can we be the aggressor early,” Amaker said. “One of the points of emphasis for us all the time is we really monitor free throw attempts and I just thought that they responded very well to that, making plays, the decisions I think come with that.”
On the other end of the floor, the Crimson forced eight turnovers and held BC to 38 percent shooting in the half. For its part, Harvard would close the half shooting 57 percent from the field and 50 percent from three.
STRUGGLING TO CLOSE IT OUT
Also reminiscent of its matchup the night before, the Crimson, while keeping a healthy lead for most of the second period, struggled to close out the game late.
“They’re always hard fought games,” Amaker said. “Obviously we got off to a great start this evening, but similar to last night we got to the finish line.”
In the second half, the Crimson struggled to create offense and make key stops. Despite another five assists, Chambers would go 0-of-5 from the field while the team as a whole turned the ball over seven times in the period.
After taking a lead as large as 18 in the first half, Harvard turnovers and fouls allowed the Eagles to cut the lead late in the game. Sophomore Jerome Robinson, who led all scorers with 25, kept BC afloat late in the game.
With a little over two minutes to play, Robinson would hit a three to cut the Crimson’s lead to six. Despite facing a full-court press in the closing minutes, Harvard managed to hold on to the lead and hit free throws to close out the game.
“The kid, Robinson, is just so hard to guard,” Amaker said. “We tried different players, different things, and you have particular percentages for his shooting but I’ll tell you what, he’s very, very tough to defend and I thought they played their tails off tonight to make it very interesting for us as the game closed out.”
Harvard would shoot 39 percent in from the field in the period on 2-of-6 shooting from beyond the arc. Despite games on back-to-back nights, the Crimson would come away with another win.
“In the Ivy we play back to back so being able to come out and compete at a high level last night and tonight really shows that we’re getting there with our focus and our competitiveness and trying to figure out who we are,” Chambers said. “So I think we did take a big step with some tough wins against some tough opponents that didn’t give in and give up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the inaugural game of its campaign towards a third-straight national championship, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team not only earned the victory against No. 9 Dartmouth, but the squad posted a perfect score.
Winning the matchup hosted at the Crimson’s Bamaby Squash Courts, 9-0, Harvard (1-0, 1-0 Ivy League) didn’t even let the Big Green (1-2, 0-1) win a single game. Every single player on the Crimson bested their respective opponent 3-0.
“I thought the team did well today,” junior Sue Ann Yong said. “Sometimes it's easy to be too relaxed when we are playing a lower-ranked team, but I think the team did well to maintain focus and play some disciplined squash. Individually, I was happy to start off the season and put into play what I've been working on at practice for the past few weeks.”
At the number one position, sophomore Sabrina Sobhy continued her dominance. Last year as a freshman, Sobhy was named Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and was recognized as a College Squash Association First-Team All-American.
The team also brings in four freshmen to supplement their nine returning players from last year’s championship team. Three of these players—Gina Kennedy, Amelia Henley, Eleonore Evans—at the number two, three and seven positions, respectively, picked up their first collegiate victories with ease.
“We have an amazing class of freshmen this year, all talented and eager to compete,” Yong said. “I think they add some fresh excitement and motivation to the team, and I'm sure they will bring that momentum forward into the season.”
Junior Alyssa Mehta picked up her victory in the number four position. Mehta, like Sobhy, was a CSA First-Team All-American and All-Ivy League player. Crimson sophomore Kayley Leonard earned the same honors in the 2015-16 season.
Representing the number five position, Yong picked up the team’s fifth perfect victory with sophomore Sophie Mehta picking up an equally impressive win as the number six player.
Captains Caroline Monrad and Dileas MacGowan both picked up their wins in the number eight and nine slots, respectively.
The Dartmouth team came into Wednesday’s competition with two matches already under its belt. The team took its first loss in the first match of the season to Trinity, 7-2. Bouncing back, the group beat Marshall, 8-1. This is a Big Green team that is coming off of a B Division National Championship last season.
“There's always some nerves going into the first match, but I think the team was very excited to kick the season off as we build up to the heart of the season and really big matches come J-term,” Yong said.
Harvard, however, completed only three clean sweeps in their national championship season last year. It was against St. Lawrence, No. 16 Brown in the Ivy League Championship, and No. 8 Cornell in first round of the CSA National Championships that the Crimson posted perfect games. The 2015-16 season represented the fourth time that the team had taken the national gold in five years.
In fact, Harvard is on a 24-game win streak, with its last loss coming on January 11, 2015, to Penn. With its next matchup against Drexel on January 13, the Crimson will officially go two years without a loss.
“We were playing without two team members so a clean sweep is an especially good result and really shows how strong our team is this year,” MacGowan said. “We've put in a lot of training on court and have also focused more on mental preparation this year than in previous years, so it'll be interesting to see how that affects our performance and results this year.”
