After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My Harvard experience will be “transformative,” they said. Freshman year would be a good time to explore my academic interests freely, they said. Well, I tried. I met lots of friends, experienced lots of academic challenges, and got used to studying in the United States — I’m an international student, by the way. It’s true that a lot of things have changed in my life this past year in college. But in terms of my academic path, the only transformation that I have gone through is that I have become more confused than ever.
I still remember how during the first semester of freshman year, everyone was very enthusiastic about asking each other about future concentration plans. Back then, we all had easy answers — none of us knew what to expect, so we would just tell each other about any academic or career path that sounded impressive or interesting. Nowadays, when someone asks me what I want to concentrate in, I do have a default answer that I give them. They say “oh, nice,” and move on to some other random topic. What I do not tell them is that I honestly have no clue. The fact that I halfheartedly answer that question does not at all mean that I know what is going on in my life. I don’t. I used to think I would be able to do this. I used to think that I would be able to do well in those particular classes that ensured A's and A-'s to students placing in the top 50 percent of the class. Now, all I know is that I am lost. I’m constantly jealous of my friends that manage to keep getting good grades and have a clear idea of what they want to do in college and what kind of job they want.
A lot of us feel so much pressure to succeed, or at least to look as if we are doing well. For me, this comes from mainly three sources: myself, family, and peers. I am expected to make choices that would lead to a lucrative career, and there is an implicit belief that ending up with certain jobs that are not well-paying or socially respected would be a waste of my Harvard degree. Showing signs of uncertainty and being honest with academic struggles is shunned by many students; sometimes, I don’t want to admit that I’m not doing well because I’m well aware that doing so would lead to a banal string of comments from the other person that are seemingly supposed to make me feel better but in reality do nothing to solve my uncertainty. I’m internally scarred when I see that other people try to relate to my hardships in a certain class but actually cannot understand my struggles because they find the class very manageable. I’m not trying to fault others for making me feel bad — I just want to point out the emotions I experience in my everyday life, especially when I think that I’m not working hard enough, that I’m not as talented as my friends, and that I have no idea what to do with my life. In fact, even I don’t know how to offer genuine words of encouragement to my peers going through similar problems because no matter what I say, it wouldn’t be anything new or profound. The burden ultimately falls on us to reflect on ourselves and escape from this trap of negativity.
What is ironic is that although we worry a lot about our future plans, our lives are so busy that we rarely have time to stop and think about the future. At least for me, my day to day thoughts are centered around preparing for an upcoming exam, thinking about how much of my essay I should complete today, and so on. It is when others ask me about my life looking forward that I realize that I have no plan and have to scramble for a general answer. It is only afterwards that I am left with a feeling of emptiness and start reflecting on my life to make sense of what is going on.
I would like to ask you to take a moment in your daily life and think about whether you are studying a field because you like it. If you already figured out what you’re good at and want to do later on in your life, I commend you for that. I would love to be at that stage in life. But if you find yourself in doubt about whether the concentration you intend to choose or the career path you say you want to take is genuinely what you want, think about what makes you dissatisfied. It might be the less-than-optimal grades you are getting. It might be the burden of success you have, forcing yourself to choose an area of study because doing so would give you a better chance at that prestigious finance career that everyone else is dying to attain. Whatever realization you come to, you will have reached a better understanding of what drives your choices. Maybe having this time of self-reflection and realization about what you truly want is part of that “transformative” experience that we were promised as we entered Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone who’s ever considered getting mental health treatment will know it’s a strangely difficult choice. The first step requires not only admitting that you have a problem, but that the problem is so serious you are no longer in control of the situation.
Instead of taking that first step, it’s much easier to just ride the wave of terrified optimism and tell yourself that you are, in fact, in control of the situation, as if this disease is just God’s way of measuring your willpower (or something like that), even though you aren’t actually Christian.
Yet when those lies begin to obviously fall apart, you are left with the same unsolved problem and the same choice.
Instead of making the right choice, you begin to spend all your time stressing about the logistics: How will you fit an hour of counseling into your “busy” schedule? What kind of excuse will you give if you run into someone you know? How will you mark appointments in your calendar so that the person sitting next to you won’t be suspicious? What if they tell you to take medication? What are the side effects?
Despite all these procrastinating concerns, almost exactly one year ago I finally had to admit it: I was absolutely not in control of the situation, and alternating between trying to perform cognitive behavioral therapy on myself and calling psychology a “fake science” was not going to fix it.
So I took that first step.
I thought it’d feel as dramatic as jumping across a canyon, but honestly it was just a step. Our brains have this amazing way of making things seem more difficult and complicated than they really are, and I’m here to testify as to what the reality of seeking counseling actually is.
First, Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is a stellar service. It is located right in the Smith Center, which is right in the heart of campus and is actually more than an ugly mess of concrete now. There is almost no wait time for your first appointment —  a miracle when you consider how some universities have a three-month long queue. The people there are actually nice. And finally, for students who have paid the Student Health Fee, the cost of these services are covered in full by the University. There is therefore no reason why you shouldn’t at least try it out. The people will work with you to find a solution that works, even if it takes months to do so.
Second, the logistics for initiating counseling are really not that hard. That first thirty-minute phone call is straightforward, and all the data they take from you is carefully reviewed by your counselor before the first meeting, meaning that you aren’t ever wasting your time. An hour a week is pretty easy to fit into your schedule and can be sandwiched in between classes. There are more than enough euphemisms to fill your calendar with. And I never ran into anyone I knew — but if I did, I really should have been having an honest conversation with them about why we were both there anyway.
Finally, realize that getting help does not mean giving up control. I may have enrolled in counseling when I was the most helpless, but counseling ended up being the most empowering thing I did for myself all semester. Not only did I learn to approach my mental illness as something separate from who I was as a person, I learn also to analyze and tackle it constructively with the help of a professional. After all, psychology is not a “fake science,” and while counseling is not a magic bullet, it is a leap towards recovery.
All of this writing is just a long-winded way of me saying, if you need help, go get it. Far too many of us have dealt with mental illness or know a friend who suffers from it to stay quiet. If we don’t take that first step for ourselves or find the courage to drag our friends towards it, no one will.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 13, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, referred an anonymous letter to the FBI detailing an allegation of attempted rape by Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. At least two more sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh have subsequently emerged, throwing into doubt Kavanaugh’s previously assured confirmation. However, the open Supreme Court seat was not the only position Kavanaugh was slated to soon fill. Kavanaugh was also granted a lecturing position at Harvard Law School for the winter of 2019. In light of the accusations against Kavanaugh, we believe that the University should conduct an investigation into his actions and background and, if it finds that he was likely culpable of misconduct, strip him of his position as a lecturer.
To be clear, we find the allegations brought against Kavanaugh are serious, credible, and worthy of full investigation. As we have opined in the past, elite institutions — Yale and Harvard among them — have long enabled abusers to access the highest corridors of power. Kavanaugh’s glittering academic history at Yale — and now his appointment as a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law — does not make him beyond reproach for the crimes of which he is accused. Harvard should seriously consider the allegations against Kavanaugh, and be prepared to terminate his position if it finds them credible.
This is not how Harvard has always acted. Our university has a history of privileging powerful men over the voices of victims. Jorge I. Dominguez, who retired from the Government Department last year amid sexual misconduct allegations, has not been fired and is still professor emeritus of the University. Even more troubling, Harvard had known about his record of sexual transgressions going back more than 30 years.
We believe that in addressing Kavanaugh’s alleged sexual violence, Harvard has a chance to at least partially make amends for its own complicity in supporting powerful men and silencing those that they are accused of harming. Kavanaugh’s alleged misconduct may be a national story, but it is one eerily reminiscent of our own campus culture.
We are tired of giving powerful men the benefit of the doubt. We are tired of their victims being treated as mere collateral damage — a footnote on an otherwise illustrious career path. There is no resume so spotless that it compensates for the moral depravity of sexual assault. Men like Kavanaugh have been embraced by the dominant political and cultural institutions of our country, and in maintaining its support for him, the White House now stands behind a man accused by at least two women of sexual misconduct.
We ask that Kavanaugh’s upcoming appointment as a law school lecturer be suspended pending a review of the serious allegations against him. For better or for worse, decisions made at Harvard fall under the national spotlight. Let us be a voice for survivors, not perpetrators. If the University has reason to believe that Kavanaugh was culpable of sexual assault, we believe that accepting him onto our campus would be an insult to survivors within our own community. Harvard must clearly demonstrate that it prioritizes their needs, believes their experiences, and will fight for their safety.

Whan that Octobere with his coloured leaves, the cool of Septembre hath perced to the roote, thanne folk get down with Ills and Seeckness. The Healr of HUHS is weak and full of Sin and hath no Power over the Daemon that lives in thy Lungs. Hence, thy lyfe is in thy own hands and the hands of the Lord thy God. But fortun smyles upon thee! Fiftene Mynnets, known for science and for heigh renoun, has tips and trycks for beaeting the mukus Devile.
KEEP THOSE HUMORS IN GOOD BALANCE
Even the Smallyst and the Stupidyst of Children knows that the most common cause of a Cold is too much Blood and too little Bile. Breake out those Leechys, the holiest of the Invertebrates of the Lorde. Styck them all over your Pathetyc and Sickly flesh! When you are Pale and can Barely Walk and are Dizzy from the Lack of Blood, you should quickly down a pynt of Ale to stimylate the bile in the Liver.
GET PLENTY OF BED REST
The Sleepyng and the Restyng wyl attrakt the Spirit of the Lord!
CALCULATE THOSE PLANETARY POSITIONS SO YOU CAN USE THE PROPER ASTROLOGICAL HEALING TALISMAN
Nothing is more embarrassyng than trying to use a Rooster Fethyr to heal a cold when Venus is in retrograde. What is this, 950 A.D.? Such a Foole probably thinketh Aristotelian Philosophie cannot be Reckonciled with the Holy Bibyl. Do not be a Foole! Consult your locol astrologyr for help in choosing a Talisman.
GARGLE WITH SALT WATER TO SOOTHE A SORE THROAT
The Devile loves to Establysh his Army in the throtes of the faithful. The faithful will thyn be Sad that theyr throte is Sore and will swear alleegance to the Army of Darkness and Daemyns and turn away from the Lorde. Do not do this! Instead, lyk how the Lorde drowned the Pharaoh and his evyl army in the Red Sea, you should drown the Devile’s footsoldiers in the saltiest of saltwater.
BE NEAR A LARGE PILE OF PRECIOUS METALS
Remember the good Doctour from that work of contemporary fiction, The Canterbury Tales. For gold in phisik is a cordial, therefore he lovede gold in special. A Wyse Man Indeed! Gold will cure All Ills! If you are poore, have a Fryend or a Pal rob a Caravan on the hyway.
HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE
Drouwn the Devile in flooids and liquids! In all this world ne was ther noon hym lyk to speke of phisik and of surgerye than hym who drinks the Beer and Spirits until the Devile comes out.
ENGAGE IN SELF-FLAGELLATION UNTIL ALL YOUR SIN IS APPROPRIATELY EXTINGUISHED IN THE EYES OF GOD
This is the Most Importynt Tip! All the Talismen and the Leechys and the Gold in the World will have no power over ye if the Lord is not Satisfyed. Yes, Clement VI has condymned this practice, but do not compromys your health by bowing to the Papal authority. Whip away! The more boyls and pustules that emerge on thy back, the more forgivyn thy be.
If you follow these tips, you too can live to the ripe old age of 32!

Maybe you were one of the 1.2 million people who, in the last month, watched the “Mamma Mia” cover on YouTube entitled “THIS MAN FLEW TO JAPAN TO SING ABBA IN A BIG COLD RIVER” and wondered, “What inspired such an elaborate video?” According to the title of a popular post on a video subreddit, the impetus was this: “My girlfriend broke up with me after we planned a trip to Japan. So I brought my Dad instead… and made this music video.”  But, curious if there was more to the story than what the subreddit post proposed, FM reached out to the voice behind the video to clarify these rumors. Fortunately, the man in the Big Cold River himself, Austin B. Weber ’19, a joint Visual and Environmental Studies-Music concentrator, explained what really brought him to Japan.
FM: First off, could you give us some general background on the video—how did it come about?
ABW: I was in Japan for about a month at the beginning of the summer. I was there on a fellowship to make field recordings of Buddhist temple bells in and around Kyoto. The temples close every day at about five or so, and there were a few extra hours of daylight, so I could do whatever I wanted.
FM: At what moment did you decide, “I want to record "Mamma Mia"”?
ABW: Well, it’s a great song! I was in Italy before taking photographs and was traveling with my guitar. While I was there I started playing the song and it’s just something that I thought would be fun.
FM: One of the big draws of the video is that it takes place in the Big Cold River. How did that happen?
ABW: The river runs right through the middle of the city so it’s unavoidable. And I was living a block away from the river. I had this track and I thought, “Oh I should just sing this in random places because it would be funny and cool.” And I was lucky—my dad came and joined me for a portion of the trip so he was there to film. We just went around Kyoto in the afternoons for like two or three days. Some of it’s filmed on top of a mountain, some of it’s filmed in a river, some of it’s filmed in the middle of crowds on the street. All of the singing is live.
FM: Yeah, even looking through the various comments online, a lot of people have seen your dad in like the reflection–
ABW: In the reflection of the bus! Almost immediately, that’s one of the first things people said—“Is that your dad?” It is.
FM: Are there any other moments in the video that you find are your personal favorite or any Easter eggs people haven’t seen yet?
ABW: My favorite one to do was on top of the mountain.  We did a lot of takes of that one—when I’m yelling on the mountain and I do the arm punch.  So there’s a really funny compilation that could be made of me doing that a bunch of times in a row.
FM: Did you get any strange reactions from passersby when you were recording?
ABW: Yeah, we cut to some people’s faces in the video, but honestly people were pretty cool about it. One thing interesting about this river is that people go stand and practice music under the bridges and stuff because it’s a really shallow river. There’s a guy who would play his saxophone under one of the bridges, so really it wasn’t totally weird that I was doing that in the river. Everywhere else it was, though.
FM: And after the recording, mixing, mastering, how long did it take to make the whole video?
AW: I don’t know, it took me probably two days to make the music and another two days to make the video. Maybe three or four days in early June. And then when I got back to campus, I spent 2 days mixing it. And then one of my good friends, Nick Zampiello, mastered it in like a day.
FM: What has surprised you most about the reception of the video?
ABW:  I don’t know; it’s been really fun and wonderful. It’s nice when people like the things you do. I only make stuff because I think it’s cool and fun and my friends think it’s cool and fun. And I’m lucky I like what I do and it’s a crazy cool bonus that other people like it too.
FM: The style of your video and singing seem very unique. Are you inspired by other singers or artists?
ABW: Well, the video is done largely in the style of a great maker of music and videos—Jack Stratton of Vulfpeck. They’re a group I love a lot. I really like how James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem does stuff, also people like Bill Wurtz—same sort of vibe there. I trained as a jazz singer for a really long time, but you can’t tell. But I had a lot of fun. I just try to sound like me.
FM: Why do you think the video has been such a hit? It’s been up for what, 10 days?
ABW: Well, there’s nothing wrong with it, that’s a bonus. There’s not really anything at stake. It’s a good song—it’s just fun. I wasn’t trying very hard when I was making the video, it’s just a nice easy process. And I think that comes through. It was just a fun thing we were doing. I think people like watching stuff like that.
FM: Are you aware that you’ve already inspired a parody video on YouTube?
I show Austin a video posted just one day before that’s made in the style of his own ABBA cover. But, this time, it’s Sinatra’s “New York New York” and the “Big Cold River” has been swapped for a “Small Puddle of Urine.”
ABW: If there’s one thing to get out of the Mamma Mia video, it’s that! It’s like, the world is so fun and crazy it behooves us all to go out and make something and have fun. That’s what life’s all about. It’s about doing and moving.

On the third Tuesday of every month, millenial movie buffs flock to the Brattle Theatre, “Boston’s Unofficial Film School since 1953,” to sit in the dark for a few hours, sip on $8 draft beers, and snack on vegan-friendly popcorn. This is standard. What’s unusual is that tonight’s showing isn’t part of some Wes Anderson retrospective; it isn’t the second film in Kieślowski’s “Three Colours” Trilogy (which is white, by the way); it’s not even the umpteenth Hitchcock showing of the month. This crowd, 100-something strong, is here for Trash Night, a monthly showcase of the worst cinema that straight-to-VHS and Generation X has to offer. Tonight’s selection is “Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone,” an early 80s cash-in on Star Wars mania featuring a Walgreens-brand Han Solo (the Brattle’s words, not mine), a script seemingly Markov-chained out of “A New Hope” and “Max Max 2,” and not a hope in the world of passing the Bechdel test.
***
The Brattle, if you haven’t been, is tucked away in an alley off Brattle Street — comprising a single box office window and a lobby about the size of a Canaday double with rotating selections of beer, wine, and Boylan’s fountain sodas. The theater’s single auditorium is up a dim, single-file stairwell, seating 200-plus in in a dim room. Shallow seats line a flat floor, with the screen and stage looming close up against the front row. The whole room has the grey, at once both cavernous and cramped quality of a half-empty garage.
I pick a seat in the back. There’s a dead ringer for Stanley Kubrick sitting in front of me. Behind me, someone proclaims, “Ant-Man I felt was, like, uninspired.” In the half-full seats, tattoos peek out of shirtsleeves and run defiantly down bare arms, three women have the exact same shade of turquoise-teal hair, and a young couple is discussing which Mumford & Sons concert date they can make. If you couldn’t tell already, this crowd is overwhelmingly white — the Mayo Masses, if you will — the well-meaning movie buff, crane-your-neck-and-count-on-one-hand-the-other-POCs-in-the-room kind of white.
On the screen, a mute montage of VHS-grade infomercials is playing, the distant fading quality of analog flashing through a menagerie of late-night oddities, each edited in frantic jump-cuts to the non-sequitur quality of “The Eric Andre Show,” or a poorly dubbed anime: a 60-year-old named Betty, spandex-stretching on screen; “The Secret to Beautiful Roses”;  “Living with Scarves”; and so on, the irreality of the whole thing heightened by its abruptness, its silence, each new scene another punchline with a setup you — and everyone else — must have missed.
One of the bearded crowd jumps up on stage. He briefly introduces Trash Night (“We show god awful movies”), where audience participation and jokes are encouraged — and in fact, an indispensable part of the experience. His face turns stern. “Make sure you’re not being racist in your jokes. That’s not cool.” The audience cheers. “And don’t be a transphobe.” He finishes with a reminder to return: “If this is good for you, if you’re damaged in the same way I am, please come out!” And the movie begins.
I am now going to run through the Spacehunter’s convoluted thoughtless clusterfuck of a plot here in a paragraph (apologies to my editor), because I don’t think it deserves any more of my — or your — time. Here goes:
Walgreens-brand Han Solo (henceforth referred to as WBHS) and female sidekick #1 (FS#1) arrive on a planet based on either Tatooine or Utah, looking for three damsels in distress (DiDs) being held by some Bad Guys (BGs). There’s some sort of voiceover going on, too, but any and all exposition — e.g. who the DiDs are, who the BGs are, the general premise of the whole thing — is hard to follow in the already raucous din of the crowd. WBHS and FS#1 arrive in the middle of a battle over the DiDs, but the BGs escape with the DiDs. WBHS then discovers that a) FS#1 is dead and b) FS#1 is a robot. Then, the first of several interspersed commercial breaks — an artifact of Spacehunter’s straight-to-cable fate — filled with more of the cut-up infomercials made by Trash Night. Someone in front of me has, in desperation, pulled up the film’s plot on Wikipedia, their phone screen on full brightness. The action continues; thankfully, WBHS is no longer the sole object of our attention. A feral desert preteen (female sidekick #2, or FS#2) joins him — but “partners we ain’t,” he scowls. They trek off, in search of our three DiDs, who we learn are being held by a mad scientist threatening the DiDs with “a little mood enhancer.” Back in the desert, WBHS and FS#2 face a zany series of enemies en route to the DiDs: a tribe of aquatic amazons, some wet sumo-suit baby monsters, their own uncomfortable quasi-paternal, quasi-sexual tension, among others. The mad scientist is replaced by Giant Robot Darth Vader (GRDV), who commands the DiDs to “undress — slowly!” WBHS and FS#2 arrive, inexplicably, at GRDV’s lair. There’s a tiff, the DiDs are freed, GRDV captures FS#2 and explains, “I’m very old and I need you. I need your vitality.” WBHS arrives and saves the day, explodes GRDV, and everyone lives happily ever after. Note that I’m omitting several semi-important side characters, the fact that all but five minutes of Spacehunter take place on land, and at least three more incidents prompting the crowd to murmur about “mild sexual assault.”
***
More power to you if you skipped that paragraph. It, like the plot, is impossible to follow, and all that really matters about this movie is that it’s unsurprisingly terrible and is filled with questionable shit, to put it lightly. Moreover, it’s a Tuesday night and there are 100-odd people spending their money and time on this. Maybe they just want to laugh at something so poorly made, so obviously deficient in all the silver-screen niceties. But that doesn’t explain the good-natured crowd, the jubilant tenor the room reaches during the most egregious scenes, with each freshly contrived macguffin inducing new glee, new laughter.
This is not the deliberately seeded so-bad-it’s-good of Sharknado or its spiritual Bad Film contemporaries. This has nothing to do with age, and everything to do with intent: The makers of modern Bad Film are all too aware of their own ridiculousness, whereas the lack of artifice behind Spacehunter is all too apparent. We’re not used to seeing such a contrast between what a movie sought to achieve in its creation and what we’re ridiculing in the Brattle today.
There are jokes in Spacehunter — mostly raunchy, totally inappropriate ones with FS#2 — but the crowd isn’t laughing because these are funny in and of themselves, but instead because they can’t quite believe someone intended this to be a real movie with real jokes, made for real people. Compare this with the edited commercials Trash Night airs or Vic Berger’s Youtube edits of the 2016 election debates. Both of these montage the momentary absurdities in their source material to the greatest degree, touching upon much the same I-cannot-believe-this quality that Spacehunter carries, yet they’re obviously charged with the same winking, ironic intention that made someone sit down and create them in the first place. Spacehunter isn’t.
We’re used to seeing science fiction film, and most cinema in general, do at least a half-decent job of convincing us that we’re not sitting in a cramped grey room with 100 other people, on a Tuesday night, etc., that we’re in a far-away place with people more brave and witty than we could ever hope to be, and we’re just along for the ride. Spacehunter so earnestly professes to such an ambition that the crowd can’t help but enjoy the failing seriousness of the whole endeavor.
***
Post-credits, everyone is dispersing to Felipe’s or waiting for their Uber in quiet untalkative circles. I’m puttering around, trying to interview the few solitary, unoccupied-looking loiterers outside the theater, but they keep shaking their head and walking away when I ask their name. Someone googles the cast: FS#2 is played by Molly Ringwald. “Holy shit, she was fifteen.” A hush descends as everyone collectively remembers Walgreens-brand Han Solo asking her to “turn around” while bathing, remembers Giant Robot Darth Vader telling her, “when you give yourself to me... there’s nothing left for you.” I try, in vain, to get someone to give me their middle initial and an opinion, any opinion, but the night is over.

For a kindergarten school project, my classmates and I made web diagrams meant to serve as condensations of our five-year-old identities into the basics: pink and blue, macaroni and cheese, Disney World. We put our names in the middle circle of the diagrams and personal favorites in each of the sub-circles: favorite color, favorite animal, favorite food, favorite vacation place. Most of my answers looked like my classmates’, except for two — favorite food and favorite place. For these, I thought about my grandmothers. The circles read “Korean instant ramen” and “Atlantic City.” 

When I brought this project home from school, my paternal grandmother hung it on the wall of her living room. It blended in with the rest of the school projects, family photos, and portraits of saints that covered her walls. It hung there through lazy summer afternoons and post-Christmas-dinner, stay-for-one-more-coffee evenings.

Later, when my grandma became sick with cancer, she lived on a hospital bed in her living room where access was easier for hospice nurses. Eventually, she lost the ability to speak. There wasn’t much for me to do other than smile, hold her pale hands and study her veins, or stare at the crowded walls. The walls which, like a magnet, had quietly collected memories across years and continents.
***
Both of my grandmothers were born in the 1930s and came of age during wars: my maternal grandmother in Korea, my paternal grandmother in Italy. My grandma left Italy as a young woman, while my halmeoni decided to stay in Korea. Years later, when her daughter, my mother, graduated college and moved to the United States, my halmeoni followed to help raise me.
My grandmothers saw my brother and me as battlegrounds for their cultures, each trying to make sure theirs didn’t disappear. That my halmeoni came forty years after my grandma gave the former a significant advantage, because the years hadn’t the chance to erode memories, customs, identities. Italian had already abandoned my father’s tongue. I went to Korean school every week, but no such thing existed for Italian.

After one too many tearful attempts at combing my hair, which had inherited my father’s curls, my mother gave me a perm so I had the same straight, black hair as she did. There was no First Communion picture on my grandma’s wall — I was raised Protestant, like my mother. My maternal grandmother took each of these changes as a personal attack, a physical manifestation of her culture’s diminishing existence in this new country. 

My parents tried to play neutral between the two grandmothers, and thus I ended up spending elementary school afternoons split between the two.

Evenings with my paternal grandmother consisted of the click-click-click-whoosh of the stove and the clanging of pots and pans, the aroma of tomato sauce, the heavy steam that stuck to my skin — closing in until nothing was left in the world but her tired house. When I refused to eat tomato sauce, my grandmother would make a separate dinner for me: Tiny star-shaped pastina in chicken broth. My own mushy night sky in a bowl. 

My halmeoni lived with my family at our home. Just as during afternoons with grandma, halmeoni afternoons brought the same click-click-click-whoosh of the stove. The stove turning on often released all the tension in the room — lingering tension from the day, from our relationship. I would feel vaguely unsettled as the headlights of passing cars flashed long, distorted shadows on our kitchen walls. Here, it felt like we should be the only ones who existed.

But the food halmeoni cooked tasted nothing like grandma’s. It was pure sensory overload, and I loved its ability to make my eyes water, tongue burn, snot run down my nose. The dish that did this best of all was Korean instant ramen — the food I wrote on my kindergarten web diagram. 

The day I brought my web diagram project home from school, I spent the afternoon with my paternal grandmother. I pulled her side table next to the couch I was sitting on, slid her ChapStick and rosary out of the way, and opened my folder to do homework. When she looked down and saw “lamyun,” the Korean pronunciation of ramen, written on my project, her face remained stoic.

“Why you no write pastina?” she asked, her broken English a sharp edge.

***
Neither of my grandmothers ever mastered a language other than their own. They certainly would never speak each other’s. But at some point, they developed their own shared language: the bright colors and sounds of slot machines. These gambles were a promises of instant wealth, an equal chance for all—sort of like the American dream, but better, because all they had to give up was a handful of quarters. 

This became our yearly summer tradition: my parents, my grandmothers, my brother, and I loaded into our minivan to make the trip to my favorite place: Atlantic City. 

My grandmothers would creep quietly back into our hotel room hours after my brother and I had fallen asleep. I didn’t understand how they could spend hours and hours together without ever speaking, communicating only through laughs and gestures and eye contact.

***
When my paternal grandmother died, I saw the rawest form of grief I’ve ever seen in my halmeoni — no words, just sobs so visceral I thought she would run out of water for her tears. 

Eventually, the hospital bed vanished from grandma’s living room, the stove in the kitchen went cold, and the collection of memories on the wall began to thin. As we took them down one by one, rewinding the memory reel, I noticed the kindergarten web diagram again. I remembered my mother’s laughs when she saw it (that a five-year-old listed Atlantic City and instant ramen as her favorite things). I remembered my childhood despair that I couldn’t fit everything I wanted. I remembered my grandmother’s anger that she and her pastina weren’t represented.

But upon closer examination, I realized I had missed an addendum. Next to the neatly typed “lamyun” in the “favorite food” bubble, I had scrawled in pencil, with big, clumsy, earnest letters, “And Pastina.” The project I had seen as a battleground was actually the space my two grandmothers’ stories came together. I wonder if they came to think of my brother and me the same way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira has no immediate plans to publish the results of a health survey sent to all undergraduates last spring, saying he wants to release the data in a manner that engages Harvard students.
HUHS emailed a survey to all undergraduates last semester — something it does every other year — asking students to anonymously answer questions on topics ranging from alcohol consumption to drug usage to mental health. The survey closed on March 9.
Though he said the data has already been analyzed by HUHS staff and is ready for public presentation, Barreira said he does not believe it is useful to simply share the results without making sure undergraduates seriously consider the data.
“It’s not locked away data that can’t be shared,” Barreira said in an interview earlier this month. “It’s a question of what’s the right forums and groups to share the data and talk about how we want to respond to the data.”
Barreira said he plans to hold interactive forums that will include presentations and conversations meant to help students interpret the survey result data. He said he has yet to determine a timeline for these conversations.
“If we could do something that would really engage a lot of students in some creative conversations, it could only benefit the students,” Barreira said.
He drew a comparison to a survey that HUHS recently sent to graduate students in the Economics Department that helped unearth the reality of student learning environments at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
During the 2016–2017 academic year, HUHS and a group of Economics Ph.D. candidates worked together to develop a mental health survey designed to assess levels of student stress. Barreira said this experience led him to realize how powerful it can be when students are involved in survey generation and analysis.
So far, though, HUHS not replicated this kind of survey for undergraduates. Barreira said it is often easier to class and understand issues — like stress factors — when they are experienced by a homogeneous student body like Economics Ph.D. students.
“In graduate school, it’s really simple,” Barreira said. “They all live in their graduate department. They live and die for their departments.”
HUHS offered College students a $5 J.P. Licks gift card as a reward for completing the optional survey, an amount redeemable for roughly one scoop of ice cream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard prepares to face a high-profile trial in a four-year-old lawsuit charging it discriminates against Asian-American applicants, another elite institution has come under fire for near-identical allegations: Yale University said Wednesday that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are investigating its admissions process for possible discrimination.
Like its New Haven rival, Harvard is also facing a Justice Department probe into alleged discrimination against Asian-American applicants. That's on top of the ongoing lawsuit — brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014 — which is slated to go to trial in a Boston courthouse on Oct. 15.
Yale President Peter Salovey confirmed the departments’ joint probe into Yale’s admissions policies after the Wall Street Journal reported on the investigation Wednesday morning.
“The Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education are investigating whether Yale’s undergraduate admissions policies improperly discriminate on the basis of race, particularly in regard to Asian-American applicants,” Salovey wrote in a statement posted on a Yale website.
According to the Journal, the Department launched its investigation into Yale in April 2018 in response to a civil rights complaint filed in 2016.
The Justice Department opened its ongoing probe into Harvard's admissions in Aug. 2017 in response to a 2015 civil rights complaint filed by 64 Asian-American groups including the Asian American Coalition for Education. The 2015 complaint alleged the College denied admission to "almost perfect" Asian-American applicants while admitting similar students of other races.
At the time — operating under the aegis of the Obama administration — the Department of Education quickly dismissed the complaint, and the Justice Department also refrained from taking action. But in August 2017, several months after the upset election of President Donald Trump, a spokesperson for the Justice Department announced that the federal agency planned to investigate Harvard after all.
The 2016 complaint against Yale was also filed by the Asian American Coalition for Education, then acting in concert with a coalition of 132 other Asian-American groups. In that complaint, Yukong Zhao — the president of the Coalition — charged that Yale, Brown University, and Dartmouth College all "unfairly denied admission to Asian-American applicants by treating them differently based on their race during the admissions process," according to the New York Times.
Though it is pursuing the charges against Yale, the Department of Education has dismissed the complaints against Brown and Dartmouth because they lack sufficient detail, the Journal reported.
In his Wednesday statement, Salovey unequivocally denied all allegations of discrimination — as Harvard's top brass have done repeatedly since the lawsuit and probe began. He cited the educational benefits that stem from a diverse campus, again mirroring rhetoric frequently espoused by Harvard administrators.
“I want to assure you that while Yale will cooperate fully with the inquiries conducted by the federal government, we also will vigorously defend our ability to create a diverse and excellent academic community,” Salovey wrote.
He compared the Yale probe to challenges facing affirmative action policies practiced at other universities such as Harvard and the University of North Carolina, which is also facing a private lawsuit over its race-conscious admissions policies.
“This investigation takes place in the context of legal challenges at other universities aimed at overturning Supreme Court precedent permitting the consideration of race in college admissions,” Salovey wrote.
Experts have said the Harvard lawsuit is likely to reach the Supreme Court and that the Court's ruling could decide the future of affirmative action in the United States.
As it probes Harvard's — and now Yale's — admissions, the Justice Department is also seeking to get involved in the suit. But it's definitely not looking to help Harvard.
The department filed a sharply worded "statement of interest" in the lawsuit on Aug. 30 in which it asserted Harvard’s admissions system is “infected with racial bias.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not comment on the federal probe into Yale’s admissions process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 sharply condemned Harvard’s sanctions on members of single-gender social groups in a letter he sent to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Wednesday.
Lewis — who has long served as a staunch and vocal opponent of the sanctions — wrote in the letter that the roughly two-year-old penalties have led to the “erosion” of Harvard students’ freedom of speech, expression, and association. He argued College administrators are effectively “coercing” single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations to go gender-neutral.
“Harvard claimed a right to align students’ thinking on social matters with its own,” the letter states. “As enacted, the sanctions have nothing to do with students’ conduct, only with their alleged betrayal of Harvard’s ‘deepest values’ by joining a single-gender club.”
Lewis submitted the missive for consideration as part of a hearing held Wednesday morning in Washington by members of the Education and the Workforce committee. The hearing, which lasted for two hours, was meant to examine the First Amendment and whether institutions of higher education are protecting students’ rights. Speakers included Representative Virginia A. Foxx, a North Carolina Republican who recently proposed a new higher education law that would imperil Harvard’s ability to enforce its controversial sanctions.
The penalties, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships. Since administrators debuted the penalties in May 2016, at least 15 formerly single-gender social groups have vowed to go co-ed and, in return, have received Harvard recognition and exemption from the sanctions.
Though she declined to comment on the specifics of Lewis’s letter, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane broadly defended the sanctions in an emailed statement Wednesday.
“Harvard seeks to create a community where students have the fair opportunity to engage in curricular and extracurricular activities regardless of their gender, socioeconomic status, or other attributes unrelated to merit,” she wrote.
Lewis wrote in the letter that he believes the College would benefit from some form of congressional intervention. He declined to specify exactly how he wants legislators to act, though.
“I am no fan of government interference with private universities, but Harvard needs a civics lesson,” he wrote.
One possible “lesson” could come in the form of Foxx’s higher education law — the PROSPER Act, which she proposed as an update to the Higher Education Act. The bill, currently under consideration by the House of Representatives, contains a clause that could prevent colleges and universities that penalize members of single-gender social groups from receiving federal funding.
The PROSPER Act in its current form likely would not affect Harvard. But opponents of the sanctions hope to change the wording of a provision in act to ensure it applies to the University.
In recent months, several undergraduate and graduate members of final clubs and Greek organizations have traveled to Capitol Hill to lobby for the legislation and against the sanctions.
The Fraternal Government Relations Coalition — a group involved in that lobbying effort — also penned a letter to the congressional committee Wednesday. It, too, argued that Harvard has gone too far and that Congress must step in.
“We urge you to consider how Congress can play a part in protecting every student’s freedom of association rights, in particular a student’s ability to join the student organizations of their choosing, including single-sex organizations,” the Coalition’s letter reads.
Dane wrote in her emailed statement that Congress “should not be seeking to regulate student life at private institutions.”
The sanctions have only recently attracted the attention of Congress — but they have roiled Harvard’s campus for years, drawing student protests, faculty backlash, and two separate attempts by groups of professors to pass motions cancelling the penalties.
Lewis spearheaded both efforts to kill the sanctions. He — along with 11 0ther faculty — first filed a Faculty of Arts and Sciences motion in May 2016 declaring that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
He withdrew that motion in Jan. 2017 after Harvard administrators formed a faculty committee and charged it with reviewing and possibly revising the sanctions. In its final report, that committee did not propose any major changes to the penalties, prompting Lewis to file a second motion in Aug. 2017 — this time alongside 20 other professors — that once again sought to nullify the sanctions.
The faculty voted down that motion 130-90 in Nov. 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first full-length sit-down interview with The Crimson, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wanted to make one thing absolutely clear: at Harvard, “we don’t discriminate against anybody.”
He was referencing a four-year-old lawsuit that alleges the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Though the stakes are high — the suit could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States — Bacow is, for now at least, unworried. The brand-new president said he is “confident” Harvard will prevail in court when the suit goes to trial on Oct. 15, though he is unsure what may happen if the case reaches the Supreme Court.
Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions brought the lawsuit against Harvard in 2014, during the latter half of former University President Drew G. Faust’s tenure. Weeks before she left office this summer, the legal battle escalated dramatically when hundreds of pages of court documents revealing intimate details of Harvard’s admissions process became public.
Some revelations drew national headlines — including the fact that the University's internal research arm produced a confidential report in 2013 that concluded the College's admissions process disadvantaged Asian Americans. The study, which was circulated among top administrators but not released publicly, asserted that Asian-American applicants suffer "negative effects" not experienced by candidates of other races who apply to Harvard.
Bacow said in the interview Wednesday that he does not believe any of the documents released over the summer — including the details regarding the report — prove the College discriminates against Asian-Americans. Harvard has repeatedly denied all allegations of discrimination.
“There have been hundreds — I think a hundred thousand documents — that have been turned over through discovery and countless individuals have been interviewed under oath and there is no evidence of any intent to discriminate, policy of discrimination, limitation on the number of students admitted from any ethnic group,” Bacow said.
Bacow was serving as a member of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — when the school's research research office produced and offered the report to Harvard high-ups in 2013. But he said Wednesday that neither he nor the Corporation as a whole ever examined the report, dubbing it one of many internal research documents that failed to make its way onto the Corporation's jam-packed agenda.
“I only became aware of this through the lawsuit,” Bacow said of the report.
He added that the internal study is a draft that relied on “incomplete data,” characterizing it as “a cursory effort.” Harvard lawyers have outlined similar arguments in court, asserting that the 2013 report was "incomplete" and "preliminary" and never intended to definitively evaluate "whether Harvard was intentionally discriminating."
Though the trial has yet to begin, Bacow said he expects the real contest will play out in front of the Supreme Court.
If Harvard wins in the October trial — as Bacow predicted it will — and SFFA decides to appeal, the case will proceed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. If Harvard wins there, too (and Bacow said he is “confident” it will) a second appeal would propel the case to the Supreme Court.
The Court has ruled in favor of race-conscious admissions policies in the past, holding up Harvard’s system as a model.
But, pending the results of a confirmation hearing slated to be held Thursday for President Donald Trump's embattled nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, that could change. Kavanaugh's appointment would shift the Court to the right — and conservative America has long sought to end affirmative action in college admissions.
Bacow said the Supreme Court’s ruling in the suit would have implications not just for Harvard, but for all of higher education.
“If the Supreme Court wants to make new law, they will make new law. If they apply existing law, we will win,” Bacow said. “If they make new law, we’ll have to see what law they make.”
Bacow noted SFFA's founder Edward Blum has openly admitted that he wants to cancel the consideration of race in universities' admissions processes — and has sought to do so before.
"I think there's a lot at stake here," Bacow said.
Legal experts are divided over whether the case will wind up in the Supreme Court. Some have argued that the court may be hesitant to take on the case, given it has offered similar decisions in the past.
Both SFFA and the University have martialed large bodies of paper evidence to make their respective cases. In court, Harvard plans to call as witnesses top administrators including Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
Bacow said he will not testify at the trial because the admissions policies under fire date to well before he assumed Harvard's top job.
As things heat up in coming months, Bacow said the University is working to ensure its perspective remains part of the national conversation.
“Do I wish people had written about other things about Harvard? Of course,” he said. “But I do think that we’re working hard to make sure that our side of the story gets out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Black Law Students Association released a statement Wednesday asking the Law School to place greater emphasis on criminal justice and calling on Harvard to steer clear of investing in prisons, among other demands.
The group’s public statement — posted on Twitter Wednesday morning —  endorses 10 demands issued as part of the National Prison Strike and states the Law School must “work to better prepare its students to support the plight of incarcerated people.”
The document is Harvard Law students’ latest public show of support for the strike, a three-week-long national movement meant to advocate for prison reform in response to a riot that recently broke out in a South Carolina maximum security prison. Among the 10 demands of the National Prison Strike are “an immediate end to prison slavery,” an end to “racial overcharging, over-sentencing, and parole denials of Black and brown humans,” and calls for Pell Grants to be reinstated in every U.S. state and territory.
Roughly 30 students gathered at the Law School three weeks ago to hold a demonstration in support of the strike. In an interview Wednesday, Lauren D. Williams, president of BLSA, said the group must continue to publicly back the cause.
“I think it’s important that we as an organization stand by this cause because a lot of our work that we have done in school is really connected to this kind of work, and especially when we’re looking at a system that disproportionately impacts black and brown people,” Williams said.
The BLSA statement also included four proposals aimed specifically at Harvard. These included ensuring the University’s endowment is not supporting any institutions that profit from the prison system; creating a “movement lawyering” clinic at the Law School to prepare students for social justice work; starting pipeline programs for jailhouse lawyers and a prison law clerk program; and appointing a critical race theorist to the Law School faculty.
The final demand echoes a rallying cry of the now-inactive activist group Reclaim Harvard Law. Reclaim occupied a main thoroughfare in the Law School in 2016 to pressure the school to hire more faculty of color and to bolster the school’s curricular offerings on critical race theory.
Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in a statement Wednesday that the Law School is committed to teaching students about criminal justice reform.
"Criminal justice reform is the focus of a great deal of leading scholarship, research and advocacy by a number of faculty, clinics, and student organizations at HLS, including BLSA,” London wrote. “We learn from hearing student proposals about ways to improve the learning experience at HLS."
Emanuel Powell, one of the co-chairs of the Powerfully Utilizing Law School Educations for Political and Social Justice Committee — a subcommittee of the Harvard Black Law Students Association that organized the demonstration three weeks ago — said the group hopes to use the Harvard name to call attention to the cause.
“I think it’s critical... for us to use our platform in support of individuals who are currently incarcerated — to use our platform to elevate their voices,” Powell said.
“By attending this institution, an institution in general, we’re at a position of privilege and a position of power and we can make changes and do things and actually impact the system,” Williams added.
Both Williams and Powell said they are planning to reach out administrators to discuss the proposals BLSA put forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Toting rainbow flags and hand-drawn signs proclaiming “We Believe Survivors,” members of the Harvard International Socialists rallied in Harvard Yard Wednesday night to protest the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
International Socialists member Samuel Nighman characterized the event as a “speak-out” designed to allow Harvard affiliates and Boston-area locals to voice their concerns about Kavanaugh’s nomination. At the rally, a dozen of the roughly 35 attendees gave megaphone-enhanced speeches on the steps of University Hall. At various points, the crowd booed at references to Kavanaugh and chanted slogans such as, “They say ‘Kavanaugh,’ we say ‘Hell nah.’”
President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Anthony Kennedy in July. The judge’s confirmation seemed all but certain until two weeks ago, when women began to come forward with allegations he had sexually assaulted them decades ago.
First, Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh had forced her onto a bed, pressed his body to hers, and tried to take off her clothes at a party the two attended in the 1980s, when both were enrolled in private D.C.-area high schools. Just a few days later, another woman — Deborah Ramirez — told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed himself and pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while students at Yale.
On Wednesday morning, a third woman came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. The woman, Julie Swetnick, said in a sworn affidavit that Kavanaugh was present while a group of teenage boys drugged and raped her at a D.C.-area party in 1982. She also alleged Kavanaugh participated in similar behavior at parties held between 1981 and 1982.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly and unequivocally denied all three allegations. Both Kavanaugh and Ford are set to testify at a high-stakes and nationally televised hearing before members of the Senate on Thursday at 10 a.m.
Late Wednesday night, hours before the testimony was scheduled to kick off, two more anonymous allegations surfaced in documents released by the Judiciary Committee. The committee published transcripts of phone calls it held with Kavanaugh on Sept. 17 and on Tuesday in which comittee members asked him about charges that he sexually assaulted a woman he was dating in 1998 and that he raped a woman on a boat in 1985.
Kavanaugh denied the charges listed in both calls, at one point calling the allegations "crazytown."
At the International Socialists rally, several speakers called on Harvard to sever ties with Kavanaugh, who has taught at the Law School since 2008. Several Law School students urged the University last week to bar the embattled nominee from returning to Cambridge to teach the course on the Supreme Court he is supposed to offer in Jan. 2019. The Law School is refusing to say whether it still plans to employ Kavanaugh.
As the evening went on, the gathering attracted attention from tourists and students milling around the yard. Midway through the event, a pair of Harvard freshmen passing by — Neil K. Khurana ’22 and Oluwatobi I. Ariyo ’22 — strode up the steps to University Hall and asked for moderation and a fair hearing for Kavanaugh and his accusers.
“We have to make sure that due process is still upheld and innocent until proven guilty is still a thing that we hold true,” Ariyo said. “I mean, I don’t know if the accusations are true or not true, but —”
A member of the International Socialists cut Ariyo and Khurana off and thanked them for speaking. Several members of the crowd shouted “Go away!”
The event concluded with calls for changes to both the international political order and to Harvard’s treatment of its affiliates who allege sexual misconduct. In her speech Wednesday, Our Harvard Can Do Better member Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 said the allegations against Kavanaugh should be taken “seriously” by both Harvard and the U.S. Senate. OHCDB is an anti-sexual assault advocacy group.
“This is a person who is now being nominated for a permanent seat on the highest court in our country and who also holds a position at our University where he gets paid over $20,000 each year for teaching for nine days,” Goldberg said. “We’re requesting that these allegations, which are very serious in nature, be taken seriously.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the sounds of Kanye West and Childish Gambino streamed onto Holyoke Street, sweaty, blazer-clad sophomores mingled at the all-male Owl Club’s first openly publicized punch event Wednesday night.
The Owl has held punch events nominally open to all sophomore males for the past two years, but did not make details of those events widely available.
This punch season, though, the club sent an email to all male members of the Class of 2021 inviting them to attend an event either Monday or Wednesday. Some attendees also received individual text messages from club members encouraging them to attend.
Punch, held each fall, is the process by which Harvard final clubs have long recruited and selected their members.
The change to the Owl’s punch process comes at a time when the membership policies of Harvard's historically single-gender social groups are under intense administrative scrutiny. Fifteen former single-gender social groups recently vowed to go gender-neutral and, in exchange, received exemptions from the College’s social group penalties.
The sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus club leadership roles, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
According to several attendees, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, no women attended the Owl’s punch event Wednesday.
Though the University previously justified the social group policy by arguing it would reduce sexual assaults, Harvard administrators later pivoted to a new rationale: the sanctions, they argued, would prevent gender-based exclusivity on campus. This year, administrators changed the justification again, arguing that the policy will promote diversity of every stripe.
The Owl is one of the clubs that has remained single-gender despite the sanctions, though it did recently agree to forge a vaguely defined partnership with the historically all-female final club the IC — supposedly meant to allow both groups to "explore paths of increased inclusion" this year. The IC has vowed to go co-ed and successfully applied for College recognition; the Owl has not.
But, unlike some of its peers, the Owl does not appear to be taking active steps to imperil the policy. Three other all-male final clubs — the Porcellian Club, the A.D. Club, and the Fly Club — have not only remained single-gender but have sent representatives to Washington, D.C. multiple times this year to lobby for a law that could force Harvard to choose between the sanctions and millions of dollars in federal funding.
In pursuing an open but still single-gender punch process, the Owl apes policies adopted by the A.D. and the Porcellian. Members of the latter group committed to opening their punch process in 2016, but have since continued their traditional recruitment methods of distributing handwritten punch cards to select sophomore men.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A coalition of faculty, staff, and students aiming to protect Harvard’s undocumented population met with University President Lawrence S. Bacow Wednesday to discuss their goals with the new president.
The meeting fell roughly a year after the Trump administration terminated Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to live and work in the United States — and about nine months after the administration announced it would terminate Temporary Protected Status for residents from El Salvador, Haiti, Nepal, and Honduras. TPS provides legal protections to immigrants from countries plagued by violence or natural disasters.
Roughly 65 Harvard affiliates were undocumented in the 2017-2018 academic year, and dozens of staff members are TPS holders.
The coalition that met with Bacow formed in an effort to bring together immigrant advocacy groups across campus. Dubbed "Harvard Community Organized for Immigration Action," the coalition consists of organizations including Harvard College’s Act on a Dream, the Harvard TPS Coalition, and the Graduate School of Education’s UndocuAllies.
“I would say that one of the big goals for this meeting was for it to be one of the first formal ways of all of these various individuals coming together as a single community and using their voices as one,” said Elmer Vivas Portillo ’20, Advocacy Co-Chair of Act on a Dream, who attended Wednesday's conference with Bacow.
Bacow took office in July. Ever since, he has criss-crossed campus — spending time in dining halls and at student events — to meet with undergraduates, faculty, and staff across Harvard’s schools.
This meeting, which was originally slated to include 46 participants, ultimately involved just eight activists. Administrators told coalition members that construction at the site of the meeting forced cuts to the guest list.
“There were a lot of voices that were not heard because there were less people represented — and maybe organizations represented — but I know we made a great attempt in trying to get a variety of people represented within even the smaller group,” said Ariana Aparicio Aguilar, co-chair of UndocuAllies.
In an interview with The Crimson ahead of the meeting Wednesday morning, Bacow said he has spoken to lawmakers in Washington, D.C. to advocate in favor of protecting undocumented people. He pointed to his own personal history — his mother was a Holocaust survivor who immigrated to the United States — as one of the reasons he cares passionately about the issue.
“I also talked to people about immigration issues, about DACA, about the importance of continuing to extend the protection of Temporary Protected Status for students, for staff, for others, why it was important that places like this continue to be open to talented men and women from around the world,” Bacow said.
“I think we have a moral responsibility to try and be responsive to the needs of those who are most vulnerable,” he added.
Speaking about his goals for the meeting before it took place, Bacow said, “I’m interested in hearing what they have to say. I intend to tell them that this is an issue I care passionately about.”
At the meeting, members of the coalition raised three main concerns: the need for legal support for those at risk of deportation, the need for mental health services, and the need to secure work authorization for TPS holders.
“He did listen to us; he said he was there to listen,” Aparicio Aguilar said, adding — “with the limited amount of time we had.”
Another main goal of this meeting, Vivas Portillo said, was to create a centralized platform detailing resources available to undocumented Harvard affiliates.
“It's wonderful that we have a lot of resources at the University, whether it be immigration clinic, whether it be spaces like Act on a Dream or spaces of the graduate schools, but one of the things that we feel is this idea that it feels fragmented,” Vivas Portillo said.
Vivas Portillo pointed to a recently created website that compiles many of these resource, adding that he hopes to build on these efforts in the future.
“This was an initial conversation and we’re looking forward to a follow up with the President’s office to implement some of these goals, and also we look forward to having more resources being representative of the undocumented immigrant population,” Aparicio Aguilar said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine you’re a bulldog in the woods. You find a dead grizzly lying lifeless on the ground. You obviously take a bite, burying your snout in the flesh. Engrossed in your meal, you suddenly feel a twinge on your hind leg. You look to see what is biting you and it’s the bear. But also biting the bear is a lion. Biting the lion is a tiger. And the tiger is being bitten by two colors.
No this isn’t some demented version human centipede, it’s Ivy League football and everyone beating everyone is why no one actually knows who is better than who.
I, however, am tasked with the glorious burden of separating the wheat from the chaff, the strong from the weak, the losers from the losers. Thus I present to you, my picks:
PRINCETON AT COLUMBIA
Speaking of animals, recently, two rabid racoons were discovered at Princeton. But raccoons aren’t the only thing on the campus that are mad. Animal control should look into the football team as well.
The group looks good, salivating crazily at the mouth good. Two games, two wins. But not just two wins, two blowouts. The Tigers dropped 50 and 51 points on Butler and Monmouth, respectively. The opposing teams managed to score just 16 total points in return.
The Tiger’s offense is led by the senior quarterback John Lovett. The senior’s long blonde hair, which pokes out the back of the helmet and resembles Thor’s, might look ridiculous if he weren’t thundering each and every opponent.
If you haven’t been paying attention, you might have forgotten about Lovett. The senior served as tri-captain last season despite missing every game due to an offseason injury. Now Lovett is making his presence known and after taking the field against, Columbia is going to need some new pants. That’s a shame because it seems they won’t have anywhere to wash them.
Is this performance sustainable? Perhaps if you’re the god of thunder.
Princeton by 21.
RHODE ISLAND AT HARVARD
This is the Crimson’s second consecutive Friday night game and it’s starting to feel like we cover a high school squad. Harvard will field one more weekday matchup against Holy Cross before the rest take place on Saturday. The team actually does quite well under the lights of Harvard Stadium. It wasn’t until last year’s match against Princeton that the Crimson lost a contest at home, on a Friday night, under the lights.
But if any team can do it, it’s No. 20/22 Rhode Island. The squad is actually the highest ranked team Harvard has played since 2010 when the Crimson was downed the No. 18 Penn. Still, Harvard’s performances on both sides of the ball leave me inclined to favor it in this contest against an FCS ranked team. My gut says Crimson, and the last time I didn’t go with my gut, Yale got trashed by a mediocre Holy Cross team.
Harvard by 3.
GEORGETOWN AT BROWN
Everyone should go to at least one Brown football press conference in their life. Truly inspiring. The team which finished last in the Ivy League in the 2017 entered the press pool following the loss to Harvard — for lack of a better word — hyped. This not to say they were excited about losing. On the contrary, coach Phil Estes and junior co-captain Michael Hoecht were mad, but they believed their program would be great in the near future. I’m inclined to agree.
The way Hoecht’s eyes lit up when he talked about where the Bears went from that night, I wanted to strap on some pads and relive my high school glory days in a Brown uniform.
Also, as I’m quite fond of saying, Georgetown is really bad at football. Mark my words, Saturday will be the beginning of a Bears football dynasty.
Brown by 21.
SACRED HEART AT CORNELL
Sacred Heart doubles as a religion. Ithaca is as close as to hell as you can get still breathing. I believe the outcome here was decided some time ago.
Sacred Heart by 12.
PENN AT DARTMOUTH
New Hampshire is a fraud.
So begins an op-ed by Henry Allen in the Washington Post. Among the better lines in his visceral description of the northern state.
“There is junk everywhere,” Allen writes. “There is an atmosphere that reminds you New Hampshirites drink more beer and distilled spirits per person than people in any other state.”
Housed in Hanover, this line more adequately describes the Dartmouth campus than any I have ever read. That then begs the question, does inebriation inhibit success on the football field? The Big Green’s record so far points to no. The team squared up against Holy Cross — Yale’s opening loss this season — and drummed the Crusaders by 20.
When Penn visits this cabin in the woods, it won’t escape with its win.
Dartmouth by 7.
MAINE AT YALE
People ask us all the time, is Yale good?
When people tell you there are no stupid questions, they’re lying. This is a stupid question. For one, we go to Harvard. Of course the Bulldogs are terrible. For another, this is the Ivy League. No one is really sure if anyone is good or bad. All the teams are just equally the same.
Allow me to explain as I did in another one of my articles. By the last two weeks of the 2017 season, seven teams could win the Ancient Eight title. Yale was the team that ended up capturing that crown but lost to Dartmouth. Dartmouth lost to Harvard. Harvard lost to Princeton. Princeton lost to Dartmouth. Dartmouth lost also to Columbia, which also lost to Harvard, which also lost to Cornell, which beat Princeton but lost to Penn. There was only one team that did not participate in this mess was Brown, which lost to everybody.
What I’m saying is none of this matters. This article you just read? Worthless. The five minutes you spent thoroughly digesting my expert analyses? Wasted. You know why? Because I’m convinced every Ivy League match would be better predicted with a coin flip.
But also, Maine trounced Western Kentucky.
Maine by 13.

We’re Harvard students, so of course we’re chronically running late (RIP Harvard Time). Since being overcommitted is the norm around here, most of us wear a watch to keep ourselves in check (or just to look intelligent). Either way, what does your watch say about you?
Apple/Smart Watch
Apple watches are increasingly popular these days. They also let you discreetly read your texts in class, and who doesn’t love that? If this is your watch of choice, you probably like to stay on top of the tech trends, or you’re an athlete and like to know your heart rate at all times.
Analog Watch
A classic and elegant watch, this option is tried and true. It comes in a million different brands and colors. If this is your chosen chronometer, you probably like to play it safe and defer to a time-honored tradition.
Digital Sport Watch
These watches are very practical, if not the most stylish — the running shoe of watches if you will. If this is your go-to watch, you’re most likely a no-nonsense type who understands that function can trump fashion. What’s the point of wearing a watch if it’s not also waterproof and shockproof?
Chronograph Watch
This is the watch that has at least 3 dials and can give you the time, date, moon phase on some, and even act as as stopwatch. It can truly do it all. If this is your favorite watch, you’re probably a bit of an overachiever. You like to be able to do everything, and much like your watch, do it well with stunning accuracy.
Rolex/Any Other Really Expensive Watch
For some people, their watch is their investment. We get it: a watch can pull a whole look together. Also, who doesn’t love showing off a few thousand dollars on their wrist? If this is your preferred timepiece, you probably put a lot of effort into your appearance. You wouldn’t be caught dead in sweats unless they were say, Gucci, and even then it’d still be a maybe.
Next time you see someone wearing a watch, make note of what kind it is! After all, our watches say things about who we are.

Midterms may be just around the corner, but with the weather still hovering in the mid 60s, now is the time to explore Boston. Take advantage of Boston’s T system (only $2.25/ride!) and impress your Monday class acquaintances when you actually have something not-boring to talk about during the inevitable “how was your weekend” small talk.
Friday:
10th Annual Oyster Festival
If you for some reason enjoy the slimy nuggets of seafood known as oysters (no judgment here), head to Legal Harborside this weekend for an abundance of oyster preparations. This event runs from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. all weekend, so take advantage of tasty seafood and enjoy the company of fellow oyster-lovers!
Saturday:
Free Fall Cruise to Spectacle Island
If you like cruises and you’re not afraid of an earlyish morning, join the Spectacle Island Cruise hosted by Save the Harbour this Saturday. Check in at the World Trade Center dock at 9:45 a.m., and the cruise will get you back to Boston at 2:30 p.m. You’ll have some time to explore the island, so this could be a perfect blocking group adventure/date/romantic picnic, or anything in between!
Sunday:
Women’s Market
A Women’s Market will be held at District Hall this Sunday from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m. The market boasts “30+ womxn makers and artists” and admission is free, so this could be a great opportunity to get a head start on holiday gifts or just explore some fun creations. Plus, there are interactive booths for headshots, collage, beading, and henna, so it’s sure to be a good time!
We hate to burst your bubble, but Harvard isn’t the entire world. Go forth and burst the Harvard bubble with these Boston events!
