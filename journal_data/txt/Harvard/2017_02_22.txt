Gaudy costumes, men in drag, and crude jokes: all things you can expect from a musical from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. With a talented set of actors and clever content, the Theatricals’ 169th production, “Casino Evil,” delivers all of this and more.
This musical takes the age-old plot of the little town struggling to stay afloat and twists it into something absurd. The characters of this small Western town are horrified to see that the new casino, Caesar’s Phallus, has stolen their audience for the annual fair. As Grannie Oakley (Daniel S. Milaschewski ’17), Ophelia Thrustin (Dylan J. Peterson ’17), Ruby Slippers (David J. Lynch ’20) and Hank Kupfs (Michael A. Wingate ’18) travel to the casino, they meet a babysitter-turned-cactus, Alesha Not-A-Cactus (Eli Russell ’20) and four-year-old bandit Dennis Jimanez (Derek P. Speedy ’18). Once the gang decides to take down the casino’s owner, the morbidly obese mob boss Al Calzone (Daniel E. Hughes ’18), the plot becomes even more convoluted and ludicrous.
With its lewd jokes and crazy outfits, “Casino Evil” could have easily gone wrong. Yet the actors deliver an engaging performance by recognizing the absurdity of it all. Occasionally, an actor almost breaks character to laugh at the ridiculous line that’s scripted, invoking even more laughter from the audience. Em Fizeema (Jacob W. Roberts ’19), an ex-FBI agent and heavy smoker, made bizarre faces at the crowd during dance numbers that added to the hilarity. The actors’ individual abilities to sing and speak in voices completely different from their own also exhibited the considerable talent of the cast. Peterson used a husky, seductive voice while Roberts sounded convincingly like a smoker. Scott Kall ’20 was perhaps the most convincing of all, singing in an Italian accent as Calzone’s hench-woman, Bella Donna. Overall, the actors brought an energy to the stage that enhanced the comical experience for the audience.
The cliché nature of the play makes the show an all-around entertaining experience. “Casino Evil” is a shamelessly tasteless send-up of “The Wizard of Oz”: Ruby Slippers is almost identical to Dorothy, and Caesar’s Phallus resembles Emerald City. As the actors occasionally break the fourth wall, they recognize the outlandishness of the plot. For example, as Ophelia, Ruby and Grannie discuss men, Grannie directly looks at the audience and says, “We’re all girls here. Aren’t we?” Moments like these draw in the crowd, as did the closing act, which includes the whole cast dressed as brides calling for the audience to dance along.
The lyrics were brilliantly done and paired well with original music. The songs are hilariously ridiculous and also include many dirty one-liners, yet the Hasty Pudding is not afraid to throw in dark and politically-charged humor as well. “Casino Evil” poked fun at the recent HUDS strike and had a quick plug against gun violence. Of course, the lyrics include lines that ridicule other universities such as Yale and Wellesley, along with some self-deprecating humor about Havard itself. The jokes were funny and exactly what an audience might hope for when coming to Farkas Hall, the Hasty Pudding’s home theater.
The drag costumes are extravagant, adding to the visual appeal of the show. The makeup is over-the-top with exaggerated drawn-on eyebrows, huge red lips, and excessive blush. This just adds to the fun of the performance, reminding the audience that this is anything but your average musical.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals does an excellent job creating a unique drag show full of laughter and drama. The original music, interactive experience, and lyrics filled with college humor make “Casino Evil” a musical worth seeing.
“Casino Evil” is at Farkas Hall from Feb. 4 to Mar. 5.

In a corner of the room, hung just high enough on the wall that it misses the slanting shafts of sunlight filtering into the room, is a clock. Its shape is uneven; the wood has no embellishment. No numbers mar its smooth surface. And yet—
Yosuke Kajiya glances up at it, glances down at similar pieces of wood scattered around his workshop, and knows that time is passing, that it will always tick on.
One year has passed since his guitar factory opened.
Six years have passed since this town was destroyed. 
“On Friday, at 2:46 p.m. Tokyo time, the quake struck. First came the roar and rumble of the temblor, shaking skyscrapers, toppling furniture and buckling highways. Then waves as high as 30 feet rushed onto shore, whisking away cars and carrying blazing buildings towards factories, fields and highways.”
–New York Times, March 2011
“Even before the tsunami, there were so many problems in this city, like the declining population and aging society. … Even though more than 70 percent of my town was destroyed by the tsunami, we have been able to restart and begin tackling these demographic problems. In this way, Onagawa can become a role model for all of Japan.”
– Yoshiaki Suda, mayor of Onagawa
“Sessionable, a guitar manufacturer that has set up business in the Ishinomaki area of northeastern Miyagi Prefecture, today held a ceremony to commemorate the completion of its guitar factory in the town of Onagawa in the prefecture. The factory, named ‘GLIDE garage,’ … officially starts production today.”
–Mitsubishi Corporation press release, March 2016


All this—the timeline of devastation and revitalization that I had wandered into—I would find out later, by stepping into Yosuke Kajiya’s guitar shop. The clock on his wall was the unadorned body of a guitar. And every instrument in his shop was a tangible manifestation of how he, along with every other entrepreneur, businessman, policymaker, and resident in the area, had rebuilt Onagawa.

Although Onagawa’s buildings are slowly re-emerging, its population continues to decline. Young people are few and far between. And yet, for those that remain, whether they envision becoming pop stars or teachers or entrepreneurs themselves, one day they may wander into the center of town, and hear music, and see through glass windows the clear shape of Kajiya’s dreams: the half-finished frame of a guitar.

This piece was a result of an innovative, intellectual, and far-reaching journalistic experiment: 10 foreign student journalists, invited by the Prime Minister’s office and hosted by HLAB, sought to explore and illuminate Japan over a span of 19 days. Encouraged to pursue whatever topic they found interesting while participating in various activities of HLAB or while exploring various cities in Japan on their own, the journalists’ work eventually spanned topics ranging from Japanese views of success and failure to the robust Japanese artisan culture. See some of the other pieces.

Laughter filled the First Parish Church on Friday night as George Saunders dispensed wit and wisdom about writing and the role of art in today’s world. His visit to Cambridge was part of a several-week tour promoting his new book, “Lincoln in the Bardo.” The Harvard Book Store hosted the event, which included a dramatic reading of the book by Saunders and a cast of five others.
“Lincoln in the Bardo” is Saunders’ first novel, but he is no newcomer to the literary world. His essays and short stories have earned him much critical acclaim, as well as a MacArthur Genius Grant and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He seems to have adapted well to longer-form work, as his novel has already received tremendous praise. The book focuses on one night in which President Lincoln visits the grave of his son, Willy.
Saunders tells the story from the perspectives of the ghosts who reside in the graveyard, but includes many informational quotes from historical texts and accounts of the time interspersed in the fictional narrative. In the excerpt that Saunders read at the event, the two main characters possess Lincoln, giving them access to his thoughts. Interspersed with reflections on the death of his son are quotes from his diaries and letters written about the bloody Battle of Fort Donelson, a key battle in the Civil War. The passage was moving and emotional, but also very funny at times.
This combination of humor and pathos carried over into the question and answer session, in which Saunders offered much more than writing tips. One audience member asked how to feel engaged in art, given the current political situation. “This moment is taking a lot of stuff from a lot of different people,” Saunders replied. “Don’t let it take [your art] away from you too.” The author made no attempts to hide his political leanings or his feelings towards President Trump and said that the duty of liberals in this moment is to be “empathetic and fierce.”
Saunders also gave out more general lessons for the artists in the room. He recalled telling the father of one his childhood friends that he wanted to be a writer when he grew up told him he should, and asked Saunders, “[O]r else you know who you’re going to blame?” Saunders replied, “Yeah, myself.” But the father corrected him. “You’ll blame your wife and kids,” the father said, and that advice stuck with Saunders.
Many of the audience members were already longtime fans of the author, having gotten to know his short-form work. He moved some attendees, like Katherine J. Frick, a fan of Saunders, primarily through his political message. “It was inspiring,” she said. “I think at this moment, hearing someone speak positively about what we can do, and where we are, is really rare.”
Tony Discepolo, another audience member, described Saunders as “very down-to-earth.” He continued, “I think he is expressing a view that a lot of people aren’t expressing right now.”
Others were particularly interested in his writing. J. Gregory Given, a doctoral student in the study of religion, found his historical references compelling. “As someone who uses historical sources...watching him tell parts of a story through block quotes from letters, from other books, and histories of the period, is really fascinating.”

Controversy surrounded Martin Shkreli's speech, which took place last week after the Harvard Financial Analysts Club extended him an invitation to campus. Despite Shkreli’s infamy in the pharmaceutical industry and the public eye, he attempted to steer clear of those topics and focused on his investment career. Given his tenuous connections to Harvard itself and his refusal to engage on the topics for which he is known, it is questionable why HFAC invited Shkreli to speak at all.
Although HFAC has not commented on their reasons for inviting Shkreli, his presence appears part of a broader trend, especially on college campuses, that confuses contrarianism for its own sake with intellectual output and achievement. While both are protected, the ideals of free speech are held to improve public debate and recognize multiple viewpoints. In theory, giving those with more iconoclastic views a public platform falls under these goals.
Despite HFAC’s claim that the event would be governed by “guidelines on free speech,” their actions state otherwise. Prior to the talk, HFAC told attendees they could raise any concerns with Shkreli during the question and answer session. However, questions related to his personal or legal issues, the source of many audience grievances, were forbidden. Additionally, at the talk itself, HFAC intentionally attempted to bar press access to the event. Restricting the audience’s questions, preventing honest reporting, and hindering the public knowledge of the event censored free speech rather than permitting it.
While Shkreli may have particular insights into the pharmaceutical industry, his speech did not discuss his experience in that sector, implying that he was invited more for his notoriety. His more than 5000 percent price increase of the drug Daraprim, compounded by fraud charges and a slated court case, are all infamous hallmarks of his pharmaceutical background. Shkreli’s history of harassing women on social media is another cause for concern. Most troublingly, Shkreli has shown no remorse for his actions.
HFAC and similar organizations use free speech to support their assertion that their invitees have something of value to add to campus conversation. In reality, speakers such as Shkreli flood the marketplace of ideas with noise rather than discussion, just to garner attention for those doing the inviting. In the future, we ask those who wish to invite controversial speakers to consider the value of their contribution rather than just their fame. Both should be protected; only the former is wise.

I have yet to visit Puerto Rico, but I would like to go sometime. One of the night guards in my dorm says he has a house there that my friends and I could stay at—so I may take up the offer if it still stands. I mention Puerto Rico because my ancestor Pedro Salsedo was a page on the Santa Maria, which, captained by Columbus, landed there in October of 1492. That crew had no foreknowledge of what North America was or what it was destined to become.
Now, several centuries later, there is no mistaking the promise and opportunity that this continent, and particularly these United States, offers to those who dwell here. The act of journeying from poverty or oppression to seize something better is courageous and commendable. I have friends whose parents risked everything to escape unsettled Middle Eastern countries and partake in our democratic tradition—and even serve in our military. For these people, the temporary immigration ban is most unfortunate. But I contend that it is also sadly necessary.
The crux of our identity is freedom—freedom of religion, speech, expression, and ambition; freedom that hinges on an unsigned yet uncontested social contract to a government that, by consent of the people, protects it justly. We subscribe to a bipartisan brand of liberalism rooted in the belief that all people, equally created, inherently hold rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness through their honest labor. We have shed blood for these values, and we have sacrificed in order that other nations could taste the same. My dad, my uncle, and many family friends have responded to the call to serve in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and they have done so willingly. I acknowledge and appreciate that many people in these war-torn countries hold a deep respect for their service. But some do not—and they say so openly.
In scorn of our ideals of freedom and justice stand executors of radical Islamic ideals, and the many sympathizers who observe their deeds approvingly. I cannot accept those who behead and crucify Christians, call for a second Holocaust, abuse women horrifically, or treat with great violence those who do not adopt the same beliefs. The bystanders who fail to condemn these practices commit no lesser sin, and neither the actors nor the silent spectators will edify the liberalism that defines our nation—to deny this conclusion signifies either ignorance of atrocity or arrogance in refusing to recognize it. Frustratingly, many of these people seek entry among the innocent, and in these times, due caution is necessary to protect our solid ground of liberty from anyone who fundamentally opposes it.
Many argue that the ban callously labels entire populations as radical. I would like to point out that the order is temporary and short-lasting, and is installed chiefly to allow the administration time to hone a more thorough vetting process without simultaneously compromising security. It aligns with the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act (H.R.158), passed by Congress in 2015—with a 407-19 House majority—under President Obama. In summary, the Act prescribes that entry to the U.S. from other countries will be permitted only if the governments of those countries cooperate in the effort to screen travellers thoroughly and fully share relevant information with the United States. Nations under special scrutiny are those known to house terrorist cells and those deemed to have dangerously loose border and immigration control mechanisms.
Contrary to common accusations, President Trump's policies are not against Muslims, as 87 percent of the world's Muslims, dwelling in countries like Indonesia, Egypt, and India, remain unaffected by the ban. The seven nations that have been put under the ban were first listed as “countries of concern” in a 2016 law passed under President Obama's administration. (The term “countries of concern,” specified in H.R.158, refers to nations that have not met the criteria for adopting adequate screening techniques, enforcing satisfactory border security, or duly cooperating with the United States in sharing information.) Notably, the law of 2016 in principle carries much more weight than any executive order, which stands only insofar as it is supported by law. With the nations under the current ban, President Trump has merely formalized something in response to dangers recognized before his election, in accordance with legislation that has already been passed.
My purpose in writing this is not to spark pointless controversy, but to remind us all of who we are, what we foundationally believe in, and the difficult task we face in balancing compassion for the foreigner with the hallowed freedom we enjoy. There is no pleasure in signing or carrying out an order to halt immigration from these seven countries, and President Trump has wrestled with the ramifications of tighter borders, especially for children of illegal parents born in the United States. His executive order is not heartless, but was crafted in a rational effort of protection as we look to instate firmer measures of security moving forward.

As award season reaches its climax with the Oscars on February 26th, it is impossible to overlook the largely leftist political edge of award acceptance speeches. While the entertainment media industry leans left and would have some criticism of any Republican president, the current president, Donald Trump, differs greatly from a ‘usual Republican’. Consequently, celebrities have focused on criticizing the divisive nature of his rhetoric more than usual conservative policies. In her Golden Globe speech lambasting Trump, Meryl Streep most clearly demonstrated this kind of criticism, pointing out that “without outsiders and foreigners, [we’d] have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.”
While criticism like Streep’s are direct and rhetorically powerful, it does little more than galvanize the left’s approval and the right’s disdain. Streep’s message and conservative reactions highlight the redrawing of the culture war. Whereas the old culture wars were fought on matters of religion and sexuality, Trump has redrawn the battle into one of “populism and nationalism” versus cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism. With the culture wars reset and reignited, the question remains: what is pop culture’s role?
Although the fantasy of a post-racial America after Obama’s election was quickly dashed, his term oversaw the ‘diversifying’ of pop culture and the rise of multiculturalism. Voices and narratives from marginalized perspectives—particularly women and people of color—gained prominence in national discourse. Beyonce’s proclamation of her feminism as a black woman made her the subject of conversation and admiration. With examples ranging from “Steven Universe” to “Ms Marvel” to “Transparent,” television and comics have also been telling a stories from a wider range of perspectives and identities. While movies were slow to catch up by comparison, this ethos is embraced in films from “Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures” to even “Mad Max: Fury Road.”
This trend towards diversity coincided with the growing value of inclusivity and intersectionality on the political left. As a result, the cultural and political left became more closely entwined, especially due to the Obamas’ effective use of pop culture as a political platform. This synthesis is perhaps best embodied by “Hamilton: An American Musical.”The musical quickly garnered national attention for its cast of racially diverse Founding Fathers and hip-hop score. Yet, it let its leftist flag fly with the “young, scrappy, and hungry” idealism of 2008 Obama and the belief that a strong executive is needed for general prosperity.
This growing inclusion and respect of minority voices was matched by a growing backlash to “political correctness.” This backlash was first manifested with Gamergate in the summer of 2014. Originally a controversy over ethics in games journalism, Gamergate soon devolved into harassing female game developers and commentators. They were villainized as unwanted invaders whose perspectives politicized and attacked their media, their entertainment, their culture. With its rejection of ‘diversity’ and its use of social media, Gamergate can be seen as the herald of the alt-right.
Two years later, those who resented the cultural elite and its ‘politically correct’ hegemony would join those who resented economic and political elites to vote Trump into the presidency. When then VP-elect Mike Pence was addressed by the cast of “Hamilton,” imploring the Trump administration to heed the worries of the minority communities, Trump claimed that Pence was harassed and demanded that the cast apologize. The war against multicultural pop culture thus began.
With the values represented by “Hamilton” rejected under Trumpian pop culture, what will pop culture look like? Gamergate’s premise that culture should be apolitical, while understandable on the surface, is ultimately impossible. Narratives are political because they are drawn from societal—and thus, political—experience. The desire to be apolitical is really a desire to return to what was not noticeably political: to default to the status quo that is in itself political. A prime example of this is the backlash to  “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” As the film neared its release, the alt-right charged that it was anti-white propaganda; a politicized defiling of the ‘pure,’ original trilogy.  However, made in a time when fascism was considered morally wrong on principle, the original Star Wars itself was political: its antagonists’ fascist tendencies were sufficient to demonstrate their villainy.
If art can’t be apolitical, then maybe pop culture will now be less focused on racial diversity and return to focusing on white working class protagonists. One narrative regarding Trump’s win was that he was supported by the white, working class voters who felt economically abandoned by the elite.  Regardless of how accurate this narrative actually is, there have been hints of its resonance in culture. J.D. Vance’s memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” briefly caught national attention for its depiction of the despair surrounding the collapse of white working class culture. “Hell or High Water,” a crime thriller rooted in that same despair, is up for several Oscars, including Best Picture.
One could argue that this is for the better. By appealing to minorities through their concerns regarding their race, gender, and other markers of identity—hence the term ‘identity politics’—one could argue that the left have equated ‘straight white males’ as oppressors in the process, encouraging them to act and think according to concerns regarding their identity. The white nationalist alt-right, fighting against diversity and ‘white genocide,’ can be thus seen as identity politics from the right. Should pop culture try to dial down ‘identity politics’ on the left in the hope that it will matched on the right?
I don’t quite think so.
As tactical rallying cries and mere appeals to one’s identity, identity politics are a definite cause for concern. Casting Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables” without considering their reasons for supporting him not only cuts any attempt at conversation short, but also risks pushing those supporters to more tribalistic extremes. Streep’s aforementioned speech falls into this exact trap by casting herself and her audience as cosmopolitan, pro-art ‘heroes’ and Trump as a nationalist, anti-art ‘villian.’
However, striving for diversity and the inclusion of marginalized voices should not be a means to political power, but a universal ideal, monopolized by neither the left nor the right. At its core, diversity reinforces the dignity of all individuals regardless of their race, gender, class, or creed—including the white working class which has been marginalized over the years. While the technocratic political elite have lost the ability to articulate why core values, such as diversity, are important on a visceral level, art and entertainment retain that ability by emotionally investing us in the lives of the characters on page or on screen regardless of how similar or different we are from them. Rather than rejecting those who feel economically marginalized and therefore are beginning to devalue racial diversity, we must take their perspectives into the fold before it is too late.
This is not to ask that all of pop culture be reduced to condescending fables or leftist drivel. Rather, this is an urgent call for entertainment media to reinforce the value of diversity by presenting subjects of all identities as complex characters rather than simple caricatures, especially in the face of an administration whose rhetoric has stridently otherized minorities — and whose policies look to do much worse.

After 161 years of business, Schoenhof’s Foreign Books plans to permanently shutter its doors on March 25.
Schoenhof’s, the self-described “oldest and largest foreign language-only bookstore in the United States,” was originally founded in Boston in 1856. The store moved to Cambridge in the early 1900s and has been at its Mount Auburn St. location in Harvard Square since 1983.
In a press release announcing the closure, Daniel Eastman, Schoenhof’s general director, wrote that high rents in the Square and competition from online booksellers prompted the store to close.
“In recent years a number of independent businesses have been driven out of the Square by the high rents, and Schoenhof’s finds itself joining their ranks,” Eastman wrote.
Eastman said that while the closing is not ideal, he understands that Schoenhof’s had to shutter its brick and mortar location.
“Our landlord has been quite helpful with us, quite helpful and supportive, but there is only so much that they can possibly do,” Eastman said. “There comes a point when what they’re ready to concede and what we’re able to give can’t meet.”
For several decades, Schoenhof’s has rented its location from the Spee Club.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that consumers should prioritize buying from local businesses like Schoenhof's to prevent their closure.
“You can’t expect that bookstores or newspaper stores or retailers of any kind will survive if people continue to buy online. That’s just the reality,” Jillson said.
David A. Gevarter ’19 said he was disappointed to hear the news. As a Romance Languages and Literature concentrator who speaks English, Hebrew, Spanish, French, and German, Schoenhof’s was his go-to bookstore.
“I’m a big language nerd, so I am very excited to be able to go into a store where they have a couple hundred languages available,” Gevarter said.
Gevarter also praised Schoenhof’s staff.
“I think the staff for sure was one of the best parts in addition to having such an amazing collection of books,” he said. “The staff there is incredibly knowledgable and very helpful. Even if you don’t know what you’re looking for, or if you’re just browsing, they are very helpful helping you find something that you’d be interested in.”
In the press release, Eastman said Schoenhof’s will maintain its online store as a way to continue to fulfill its mission.
“The mission of Schoenhof’s has always been to provide access to the larger world through language learning materials and literature in the original,” wrote Eastman in the press release. “Given the present political and social climate, that mission becomes ever more meaningful.”
Eastman said the website will offer a wide variety of foreign books at a low cost.
“We’d like to be able to take advantage, in a way, of having, say, the reduced expenses of our retail location, and invest that into having an amazing website that offers a complete experience, a complete customer experience as close to actually being in a bookstore without being able to be there, as well as offering the lowest possible pricing,” Eastman said.
Schoenhof’s has been a longtime member of the Harvard Square Business Association and is active in community events, particularly the Bookish Ball and Shakespeare’s Birthday Celebration, according to Jillson.
“It has been so lovely because we clearly get visitors from across the globe, and for us to be able to send them to Schoenhof’s to get a book in Portuguese or a book in French or a book in Spanish is just a delight, and something that is very unique and really will be a loss for Harvard Square,” Jillson said.
Jillson emphasized the importance of going out and buying from local retailers.
“It’s how much they care, and if they care, they will think twice before they go to Amazon to buy something,” Jillson said. “If they don’t walk out of their dorm room or out of their home and into the Square and into a store to support that store—and I don’t care whether it’s a local, regional, national, or international—if you don’t do that, the vibrancy of the Square or of any business district is jeopardized.”
Though Eastman said he is sad to see Schoenhof’s brick and mortar location go, he said he has high hopes for its online future.
“We really appreciate the support that we received from the students at Harvard over the last, my God, over 90 years that we’ve been in Cambridge. And we just hope that they’ll continue to visit us online,” Eastman said.

As Divinity School graduate Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 takes the reins at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, some members of Harvard College’s faith groups say they welcome the discussions of religion and sexuality Scarborough aims to foster.
In his time at Harvard, Scarborough has worked to help students reconcile their faith and sexuality: an initiative he co-founded at the Divinity School, for example, supports students from religious backgrounds in coming out.
Now weeks into the job as director, Scarborough—who grew up in a conservative Christian family—said he will continue to lead discussions about religion and BGLTQ student life.
“Sometimes it feels like you have to leave one or the other at the door when you go into the temple or when you go into the club,” he said. “It’s so important to recognize that at the intersection of identities, one or the other doesn’t necessarily take priority.”
Members of several of the College’s religious affinity groups say they welcome those conversations.
Talia Weisberg ’17, a member of Harvard Hillel, said the group looks to make Judaism an accepting faith for all. Weisberg noted that Hillel also has a sub-group called BAGELS, which specifically deals with issues of sexuality and BGLTQ student life.
Hanaa Masalmeh ’18, a student in the Harvard Islamic Society, said she has found the group a positive resource to discuss sex and sexuality. Growing up, Masalmeh said, she found discussions of sexuality to be “taboo” and “embarrassing,” but her time at Harvard and in the Islamic Society has allowed for more fruitful and honest conversations.
“The fact that there are people of my age, people of my background that I can discuss these issues with is something that’s really been formative for me because I have this soundboard,” she said.
For other groups, like the Catholic Student Association, discussing BGLTQ identities can be difficult because it may contradict with traditional religious teachings.
“The vast majority of us Catholics have struggled at times with the question of ‘am I really Catholic if I don’t believe ‘x,’” said Justin S. Sanchez ’17, the president of the Catholic Student Association. “While there is no minimum amount of ‘Catholicness’ you must posses in order to be a member of the CSA or or come to CSA events, there is a certain amount of adherence to orthodoxy that comes with being Catholic.”
Still, Sanchez added that he welcomes discussions with BGLTQ groups about sexuality and identity.
“I believe more dialogue between CSA and LGBTQ groups can be edifying and beneficial for many people,” Sanchez said, adding that he believes the traditional Catholic stance against non-straight relationships “is not going to change.”
Though Harvard’s religious groups explore sexuality in different ways, Scarborough said he believes discussions on faith and BGLTQ identity are necessary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students and undergraduates gathered Tuesday in the John F. Kennedy, Jr. forum to hear stories and career advice from former political speechwriters Jonathan J. Finer ’98 and Sarah K. Hurwitz ’99.
In a conversation moderated by Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, Finer and Hurwitz—who, between the two of them, have worked for former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, and former Secretary of State John Kerry—fielded audience questions and shared tips for pursuing careers in public service.
Both panelists described their careers as often random and unplanned, and often the result of “happenstance” with hard work.
Hurwitz told attendees that she worked as a speechwriter first working for Al Gore and then Tom Harkin, then a Democratic senator from Iowa. Hurwitz, however, said she did not excel under the direction of Harkin’s staff, and eventually went to law school.
“I’m always suspicious of people who can write their five-year plan on a napkin, that usually doesn’t pan out. I think my career is proof of that.” Hurwitz said.
Finer echoed Hurwitz, adding that careers in government often require a level of spontaneity.
“I am not a planner. I tend to book flights two hours before they take off—and that goes for my career experience as well,” he said. Finer said he ended up in journalism—he worked at the Washington Post for several years—“almost totally by accident.”
Both panelists also said they found amiable personalities to be necessary in their field, though they said such traits are difficult to detect.
Specifically, while hiring for senior positions during his time as John Kerry’s chief of staff, Finer said he looked for cooperative instincts in employees.
“I believe that ambition is a good thing, as long as it’s channeled towards the mission and less towards the advancement of that individual, it’s an important distinction… Low drama, low ego, is a huge plus and a hard thing to assess in a job interview, that’s why there are things like references.” Finer said.
Both Finer and Hurwitz said they found their careers both successful and rewarding, but not without ups and downs. Hurwitz described many experiences on the job as “very physically taxing.”
“Those moments of uncertainty where you just don’t know—they’re hard,” she said. “And I think a lot of success in politics is just muscling through them.”
Finer said he thinks young people often underestimate the impact they can have while working within the government.
“You have the ability to do incredible things in government at a young age,” he said. “It shouldn’t be a hard sell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. on Saturday.
The event raised $2.2 million and drew hundreds of guests, including Medical School professor Stephen E. Sallan and Dana-Farber Senior Vice President for Communications Steven R. Singer, according to science news site STAT.
Trump’s attendance, however, drew particular attention and fanned the flames of an ongoing controversy over Dana-Farber’s choice of venue.
Colleen M. Farrell, a Medical School student who organized protests against this year’s Mar-a-Lago fundraiser, said she was “disappointed” the event occurred despite heavy student opposition. Farrell said Trump’s surprise appearance “further proves the point that there is no staying out of politics with this decision from Dana-Farber.”
“You can either take a stand against the president’s policies, which are Islamophobic and harmful to immigrants, or you can be silent and let those policies become a fabric of our society,” Farrell said.
Dana-Farber spokesperson Ellen Berlin did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Since 2011, Dana-Farber, a Medical School teaching hospital, has paid the Mar-a-Lago $150,000 per year to host its “Discovery Celebration” event at the resort. After Trump’s presidential immigration order barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, however, Medical School students petitioned for the event's relocation.
In a statement earlier this month, President of Dana-Farber Laurie H. Glimcher and Board of Trustees Chairman Joshua Bekenstein wrote that Dana-Farber’s hosting the fundraiser at Trump’s resort did not constitute a political endorsement, but that the hospital would work to “avoid controversial venues” in the future.
“Our decision last year to continue to rent that facility for this long-standing fundraiser was never meant to be, and does not now intend to be, any type of political statement or endorsement of any political figure or policy position,” Glimcher and Bekenstein wrote.
In response to the decision, Medical School affiliates held a protest on Feb. 11 calling for the fundraiser’s relocation.
On Monday, Farrell said students will seek assurances from administrators that no future events will be held at Trump’s “winter White House.” Farrell said she respected Dana-Farber but hoped that its leadership will “put more of their resources behind the people whose countries have been targeted by these recent policies.”
“We would like to see the Dana Farber leadership take a stronger moral stand in its public communication regarding the executive order,” Farrell said. “Banning certain people from certain countries which can have patients and researchers is against the core values of medicine and Dana Farber.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dafna Linzer, a political news editor for NBC News and MSNBC, reflected on challenges of political reporting during Donald Trump’s presidential administration at the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Tuesday.
In a discussion with Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center, Linzer offered thoughts on journalistic ethics with regard to anonymous sources, Trump’s Twitter posts, and the President’s recent characterization of news media as “the opposition party.”
Beginning the discussion, Linzer spoke to the importance of reporting on Trump’s tweets, which throughout his month-long presidency have been frequent and impassioned.
“I hear people say that we shouldn’t report on his tweets. I strongly disagree with that,” she said. “I believe that what the President tweets is U.S. policy and [thus] is extremely important to be covered.”
Linzer said that while Trump’s tweets offer the American public an opportunity to get “a very unfiltered look at the President and [hear] from him directly,” keeping up with Trump’s “ability to Tweet facts that aren’t facts, wrong facts, falsehoods” has posed a challenge for reporters.
Linzer also offered advice on how journalists should respond to Trump’s accusations that media perpetuate “fake news” and are an “enemy of the American people.”
“We’re not at war with the White House,” Linzer said. “I don’t like to hear there’s a war between the Trump administration and journalists or journalism.”
Spencer E. Shapiro ’18, who attended the event, said he agreed with Linzer’s thoughts.
“When you read a lot of the media, or you listen to the news, it can be difficult to put it in perspective that the media really does just want to cover the facts, and they’re not trying to have a certain viewpoint or anything,” he said.
Linzer also said it is critical for journalists to continue reporting on issues that are of interest to the American people, even if those stories are based on anonymous sources. Recently, Trump has decried leaks from his administration and reporting with anonymous sourcing in White House reporting.
“Anonymous sources are never the ideal. Of course you want everything on the record, who doesn’t?” Linzer said. “But when you’re talking about policy issues, things that should be subject to public debate and public scrutiny, and there’s no other way to know about them except through anonymous sources, then I think that’s important.”
Asked by Mele whether she worries about “fatigue” among both reporters and viewers as a result of the nearly constant news coverage of the White House, Linzer said she is concerned about “voter fatigue.”
“Americans were very engaged in this election, despite what happened on election day with voter turnout,” Linzer said. “They were very engaged with the issues and I really truly hope they stay engaged in the issues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 22, 2017 at 2:07 p.m. 
Graduate student union organizers are calling on University President Drew G. Faust to provide additional support for international and undocumented students amid uncertainties generated by President Donald Trump’s seven-country travel ban.
In a petition organizers delivered to Massachusetts Hall Tuesday afternoon, members of Harvard’s student unionization effort contend that the University’s response to Trump’s order—which bars immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries—was not prompt or strong enough. In particular, the petition demands that the Harvard pledge financial and legal support for students impacted by Trump’s immigration policies.
“International students and scholars require much greater and more concrete legal, political and institutional support from the administration to guarantee their physical and emotional wellbeing and working conditions, as well as the integrity of the larger Harvard community, in the face of ongoing and anticipated attacks,” the petition reads.
The International Scholars Working Group of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers organized the petition, which over 600 students from across the University signed. Organizers said existing union infrastructure helped them mobilize students around the petition.
The travel ban, now suspended after an appellate court decision earlier this month, has sparked protests around the country, and at Harvard, fear among international students. More than 100 Harvard students and scholars are citizens of the seven countries, and at least four were initially barred from the country. Trump’s administration has pledged to unveil a revised order as soon as this week.
Harvard has roughly 10,000 international students and scholars in total, according to the Harvard International Office.
The University has taken a number of steps to respond to the immigration ban. The day after Trump signed the order, the HIO sent a message to international students urging them not to travel, and Faust wrote a letter to Harvard affiliates expressing support for international students the next day. In her letter, Faust offered legal advice through the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Law Clinic and announced information sessions for affected students, among other measures.
But the graduate students say these responses were not sufficient.
Beyond financial and legal support for students, the petition requests “immediate and transparent communication” about Harvard’s understanding of immigration changes and effects that they could have on students. Student organizers said messages from the HIO did not reach students with green cards, since the office only tracks visa holders.
“The response to this from the administration has almost been privatized, in some sense,” Eben Lazarus, a graduate student, said. “The burden of responsibility has been put on individual students to figure out how to respond to this in whatever way they find best.”
The HIO messages also lacked information about how Trump’s order might impact different types of visas, Colombian-Canadian graduate student Laura Correa Ochea said.
University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in a statement that the University is still deciding how to support students affected by Trump’s immigration policies.
“This is a fluid situation and, as reflected by the many activities we’ve undertaken, we are working to evaluate how we can appropriately support members of our community,” she wrote.
The petition also asks for extensions for students’ G-clocks, which measure the number of years that they have been studying towards a PhD, if they are unable to enter the United States.
“GSAS works directly with individual students to address issues related to G-clock adjustments and funding, because the circumstances are unique to the individual,” said University spokesperson Ann Hall. “If a student faced a situation that prevented them from returning to the country, the Office of Student Affairs would work with them to determine next steps and support.”
While it is difficult to anticipate what policies the Trump administration will unveil and how they will impact Harvard affiliates, graduate student organizers described the measures they outline in the petition as institutional safeguards.
“These are contingency plans that we can sort of deploy to ease as much as possible the situation,” Correa Ochea said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House unveiled an exhibit Tuesday that interrogates the life of its namesake Increase Mather, the former University president and a slave owner.
The exhibit, hosted in Mather’s Three Columns Gallery, chronicles Increase Mather’s life and reproduces some of his writings. A Puritan minister involved in the Salem Witch Trials, Increase Mather served as President of Harvard College in the late 17th century. He also owned a slave named Spaniard.
A small group of students, working with Mather Faculty Deans Christie McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten, dug through historical records and material from the Harvard University Archives over the summer to learn more about Increase Mather’s life. The new exhibit brings together months of research, according to McDonald.
Rosengarten said he first became interested in the project when he learned Increase Mather was a slaveholder. After that, Rosengarten said, he wanted to find out “what this man really was.”
“In a time when universities are grappling with the historical legacy of the names and symbols that describe their campuses, Increase has become one of the more controversial namesakes of the undergraduate Houses and on Harvard’s campus more broadly,” the exhibit’s introduction reads.
“Mather students and affiliates have spent some months investigating Increase’s life and legacy, contextualizing and seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the slave owner,” it continues. “This is a first attempt to pass that knowledge along to the Mather community.”
The exhibit’s debut comes ten days after Yale University chose to rename Calhoun College—originally named for Yale graduate John C. Calhoun—because of Calhoun’s legacy as an “ardent defender of slavery” and “white supremacist,” according to Yale President Peter Salovey.
Harvard has also taken steps to address its historical ties to slavery. In March 2016, the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, accepted a proposal for Harvard Law School to change the school’s seal given its connections to the Royall family, slaveholders who helped endow the first law professorship at Harvard.
In April 2016, University President Drew G. Faust dedicated a new plaque on Wadsworth House to four enslaved persons who lived and worked on Harvard’s campus during the 18th century. Faust also wrote a Crimson op-ed in support of recognizing Harvard’s past involvement with slavery, though she has said she disapproves of changing controversial names and symbols en masse.
Rosengarten and McDonald said that, to their knowledge, there are no current plans to rename Mather House.
“I don’t think that’s really come up as a serious option,” Rosengarten said. “But, you know, you do have all these questions, whether you should change the name, whether you shouldn’t.”
McDonald referenced Yale’s decision to rename Calhoun College, but said she believes the “context” in Increase Mather’s case is different.
“Given the context here, we’re trying to understand, what did Increase do, what did he do at every level,” she said. “And I don’t think we’re making any recommendations, at this point, for change.”
Zarin I. Rahman ’18, a Mather resident who helped research and set up the exhibit, said she thinks renaming is one way to appreciate and understand history, but that another method involves educating students on difficult topics.
“I think this [exhibit] is a good way to let other students know that there’s a lot about Harvard’s history,” she said. “Some things are not great and some things are great to learn about, but it’s important to be educated.”

UPDATED: February 23, 2017 at 12:39 p.m. 
On Feb. 22, the National Labor Relations Board will hold a hearing that could determine whether eligible students at Harvard can form a union. In November, Harvard was one of the first private universities in the country to hold a student unionization election.
Who is forming a union and why?
In short, Harvard undergraduate teaching assistants and graduate student teaching and research assistants, including all graders, course assistants, and preceptors. But not undergraduate research assistants. So if you’re a graduate student holed up in a lab doing research for a professor, a TF grading final papers, or an undergrad who works for CS50, you would be in the union. If you’re an undergraduate doing research for a Law School professor, you wouldn’t be.
Graduate student unions already exist at some public universities, and in 2015 some graduate students at Harvard, calling themselves the Harvard Graduate Student Union, started working towards creating an official union of their own. Union organizers hope that collective bargaining will give student workers a platform to negotiate for better compensation, job and workload protections, health and family benefits, as well as anti-discrimination and harassment policies.
Is the union working alone? 
What does Harvard think of its students’ efforts to unionize?
Several top administrators have strongly denounced the unionization efforts. University President Drew G. Faust has argued that unionization would change the “mentoring” structure between students and faculty into a “labor relationship,” and that it would be detrimental to students’ learning experiences.
Prior to the NLRB ruling in August, Harvard jointly filed an amicus brief with six other Ivy League universities, Stanford, and MIT opposing student unionization. One of the case’s core arguments was whether academic student workers should be considered primarily students or university employees.
In the days leading up to the vote, top University administrators Graduate School of Arts and Science Dean Xiao-Li Meng, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 sent emails directly to the student body, urging eligible students to take part in the election and to consider potential consequences of unionization.
Why don’t some students want to unionize? 
Some students worry that the cost of union dues might be greater than any potential pay bumps earned during collective bargaining. They also said that the union could disrupt academic projects and researched and are concerned that a single union could effectively negotiate for such a diverse labor force.
As the election date drew nearer, some students became more vocal about their criticisms of HGSU-UAW and formed their own loose organization, called “Against HGSU-UAW.” Many members of the group are science and engineering students, and fourteen graduate students recently penned a letter arguing that the NLRB should uphold the results of the November election.

Why is the NLRB holding a hearing?
Here’s where it gets complicated. At the hearing Wednesday, the NLRB will consider two separate issues: which ballots from the November election should be counted and objections both Harvard and the union organizers filed to the conduct of that election.
The NLRB originally scheduled the hearing to decide whether 314 ballots, which were challenged and held separately from the other ballots, should count in the election. A December vote count that did not include the 314 contested ballots showed that 1,272 students voted in favor of unionization, while 1,456 opposed it. Because the vote margin against unionization was smaller than the number of unresolved challenged ballots, the vote count remains inconclusive. Depending on which ballots the NLRB decides to count at the hearing, the challenged ballots could sway the results of the election.
There’s more. Both HGSU-UAW and Harvard have filed formal objections to the November election. In their objection, the union organizers charge that the NLRB should invalidate the election and hold a re-vote. They argue that Harvard did not provide complete and accurate lists of eligible voters before the election.
Harvard’s objection is much more narrow in scope, taking issue with a single vote that was not counted. The NLRB worker who was counting votes from the election marked one ballot void because, in addition to marking the “no” box, the voter wrote a message to the vote counter and drew a smiley face.
The NLRB will consider both the objections and the challenged ballots at the hearing Wednesday, though it may not make a final decision about the outcome of the election that day. Both the union and the University will call witnesses to testify about the election. Both sides, working with their lawyers, also filed pre-hearing briefs with the NLRB.
What happens if students unionize? 
HGSU-UAW would begin representing student employees in bargaining sessions with the University. Organizers intend to hold elections for a bargaining committee and to survey students about priorities during negotiations.
If the union ratifies a contract, all graduate student teaching and research assistants, as well as undergraduate teaching assistants, would begin paying dues to the union; it wouldn’t matter if an individual voted for unionization or not. UAW’s base rate for dues is 1.44 percent of an employee’s income—that money goes toward strike funds, paying organizers, and legal staffing.
Students could not fully opt out of the dues, but they could pay a reduced fee that only covers “representation” costs, which have to do with bargaining the contract, and not “non-representation costs” from political work, for example.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not particularly unusual for sophomore Sonia Wang to put a team on her back. The Upland, Calif. native has earned four All-Ivy League honors, qualified for the NCAA Championships, and set multiple records throughout the span of her Harvard career. Yet at last weekend’s Ivy League Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships, Wang brought unusual meaning to that common phrase.
Wang came into Friday’s 400-yard individual medley as the event’s defending champion, and she finished holding that same title. However, Wang’s victory came under circumstances distinct from those she faced a year ago. After she missed the entirety of the season up to that point battling a stress fracture in her back, the event marked her first return to the pool.
The road to Wang’s repeat title has been marked by the challenge of an injury, one that has not only been difficult to overcome, but also to pinpoint. Yet, to her teammates, Wang’s determination to compete has been evident throughout her journey.
“They don’t really know what exactly it [her injury] is, but it happened earlier this season,” co-captain Daniela Johnson Restrepo said. “She’s seen a lot of specialists, and they don’t know the actual cause of it, but it’s like a fracture. She’s been trying to rest her back, while also training, which has been crazy.”
“Her coming back, to be able to swim for the team this year was an amazing accomplishment,” co-captain Summer Schmitt said. “It speaks so much to her dedication to the sport and to the team.”
Striving to get back in the pool, Wang has dedicated herself to the process of recovering. Leading up to her return, she sought medical counsel and was instructed to rest. But Wang did not neglect her training while heeding this advice, working diligently to fight her injury.
“She’s been going to the training room,” Johnson Restrepo said. “She had to do a lot of side things to get ready for this weekend.”
Regardless of her performance in the water, Wang’s journey from injury to the Ancient Eight Championships at Brown University would have been notable. However, her performance in the 400 IM truly proved to be a remarkable feat.
Wang started the event out in front, but the swimmers to her right and left slowly began to close in on her lead as the race progressed.
“When [Wang] pushed off in the freestyle leg, I think she could see this one other girl in particular,” Johnson Restrepo said. “You could see, especially on the lap 50, that she just increased her stroke rate, really fought all the way to the wall, and out-touched the other girl.”
While other swimmers may have the tendency to lose steam as a long-distance event progresses, Wang’s teammates claim that the opposite can be said of her.
“She is definitely a distance swimmer and she comes on strong at the end,” Schmitt said. “It’s always fun to watch her race, because she fights all the way to the end.”
“Usually people get slower in the race, but she just kept on getting faster,” Johnson Restrepo said. “It was really inspiring to watch.”
Pulling ahead with her final surge, Wang was able to touch the wall first in a time of 4:14.21. Wang’s mark was enough to not only secure her title as the event’s defending champion, but also to break the Katherine Moran Aquatics Center pool record.
Wang’s performance gave momentum to a Crimson team that went on to finish the Championships in second place overall in the Ancient Eight. Overcoming injury to claim her first-place result, Wang left those in attendance stunned. But, for her teammates, Wang’s efforts in the title meet simply showcased what they already knew to be true about her.
“She’s such a fighter,” Johnson Restrepo said. “This girl is one of the greatest fighters I know of.”
“She pushed herself so hard for the team,” Schmitt said. “She did it for all of us. I hope she was proud of herself, because it was amazing.”
The Upland, Calif. native’s success wasn’t limited to the 400 IM, as she picked up two more podium finishes over the course of the meet. Wang claimed the bronze medal in both the 200-yard individual medley and 200-yard butterfly, as well.
Overcoming the obstacle of a broken back, Wang left with a broken record and a claim to back-to-back titles. Last weekend’s efforts speak not only to Wang’s skill within the pool, but also to her incredible resiliency far beyond it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team found itself in an unfamiliar position within the first 66 seconds of Tuesday’s road contest with Holy Cross. Junior midfielder Matthew Fischetti fired a shot past Crimson junior goalie Robert Shaw to put the Crusaders up a goal. It was a spot that Harvard had not found itself in since last May’s Ivy League Tournament Final.
The early deficit served as a wake-up call of sorts for the Crimson as the guests scored the game’s next three goals and held on to beat Holy Cross, 12-9. Attacker Morgan Cheek led the way for Harvard (2-0) as the junior notched three goals to push his season total to seven.
“Morgan’s our best player and not only that, he’s also our hardest worker,” tri-captain Matt Ryan said. “It’s not a surprise for me to see him producing at this level. He’s been working his tail off for a long time and he’s really stepped up as a leader.”
The Crusaders (0-3) scored the game’s final four goals but it proved not to be enough. Three different Holy Cross players each tallied two goals on the afternoon.
“I think for the most part everyone was going hard, we had the right mindset,” tri-captain Sean Coleman said. “At times, we looked really good. The coaches have done an awesome job of making the practices really competitive and really hard so that when we hit the field on game day, the games are easy to us.”
The Holy Cross lead lasted a mere three minutes and 27 seconds. Cheek got the Crimson on the board with an unassisted goal to keep his hot streak going. Neither team could break the deadlock despite a flurry of Crusader shots and a penalty against Holy Cross senior midfielder Marc Buermann. Freshman Nigel Andrews gave Harvard its second goal of the afternoon to provide a lead that the Crimson would not relinquish for the rest of the contest. It was the first career goal for Andrews, a first-year midfielder from New York City who prepped at Deerfield Academy.
Andrews was not the only Harvard freshman to get in on the Crimson’s offensive onslaught. After his team controlled the ball for most of the time immediately following its second goal, first-year defenseman David Strupp gave Harvard some insurance before the teams switched sides following the first intermission. It was the second goal in as many games for Strupp as senior defenseman Ryan Norton chipped in an assist. Andrews lit the lamp again in the fourth quarter while classmate Dalton Follows tickled the twine in the second. All told, the Crimson’s freshmen combined for four goals and an assist on the afternoon.
“I think we have a lot of young guys and new faces and that’s been awesome,” Coleman said. “I think they’ve been playing awesome across the board. It’s just good for them to get experience early on in the season.”
The Crusaders would cut the deficit to one goal three more times on the afternoon but could never break through to get an equalizer. Senior attacker Jack Ortlieb scored late in the second but Follows’ goal came just 91 seconds later to put the lead back at two. Senior attacker Kevin Lux got the hosts back to within one but Cheek was the one to rain on the parade this time. Hoping that the third time would prove to be the charm, Lux took matters into his own hands, scoring an unassisted goal to take Holy Cross into halftime trailing by a single goal.
“The most positive takeaway was...not getting too high when we had good moments and not getting too low when we had bad moments,” Ryan said. “We kept a pretty even keel throughout the game but certainly a lot to work on going forward.”
Juniors Joe Lang and Coleman scored within ten seconds of one another to put the Harvard lead at three while Coleman’s second goal of the afternoon, which came just 80 seconds after his first tally, put the Crusaders behind by four. Throughout the early second half and into the fourth quarter, the Crimson remained in the driver’s seat, scoring four of the next five goals to push its lead to seven at 12-5. Penalties down the stretch allowed Holy Cross to muster some rhythm on offense and score the game’s final four goals. Harvard took four penalties on the afternoon, something it has done in both contests over the last week.
“Our intensity level was pretty high throughout the game,” Ryan said. “Our execution wasn’t quite there, certainly a lot of things we want to improve on that we will have to improve on to get wins going forward.”
