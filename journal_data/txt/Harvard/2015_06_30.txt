After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than two hours of public discussion, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal on Thursday delayed a decision on Harvard’s plans to renovate the Smith Campus Center until July 30 at the earliest.
Approval from the Board of Zoning Appeal would be the final step before the University can begin renovating the building formerly known as the Holyoke Center at 1350 Massachusetts Ave., which was originally set to begin next year. The plans have already received approval from the Cambridge Historical Commission and the Cambridge Planning Board. 
The plans for the Smith Campus Center include redesigns of the building’s first, second, and 10th floors and the construction of new meeting and common spaces. The plans also call for a reconstruction of the building’s front facade, where restaurant Au Bon Pain currently sits, and changes to both the indoor and outdoor dining areas.
Administrators have hailed the plans as beneficial not only to students, faculty, and other University affiliates but also to the public. Cambridge residents and members of the board at a public hearing on Thursday, however, expressed mixed opinions of the plans.
Detractors said the proposed building renovations were “too grandiose,” arguing that changes would detract from the “peaceful” nature of Forbes Plaza, the area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Dunster Street currently occupied by outdoor seating.
“If Harvard’s encroachment on Forbes Plaza is authorized, then we might as well rename Harvard Square ‘Harvard’s Square,’” Cambridge resident Thompson E. Potter said. “Harvard doesn’t need any more glittering, window dressing, or programmatic spaces.”
Other residents suggested that the proposed campus center plans would disrupt the public chess space that currently sits beside Au Bon Pain’s outdoor seating area and maintained that Harvard’s plans to decrease the sidewalk width by 10 feet would be detrimental to street performers and protesters.
People in support of the proposed plans emphasised Harvard Square’s need for welcoming indoor public spaces, especially in the winter months.
Laura E. Donohue ’85, the owner of a stationary shop in the Square, argued that the University’s plans will benefit both the area’s public and various retailers, as an indoor space with accessible public bathrooms would be especially attractive to patrons on cold and rainy days.
Members of the Board of Zoning Appeal ultimately delayed a final decision until July, saying that they were uncomfortable making a decision after hearing so many differing opinions voiced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students from Washington, D.C., to New York shed tears of joy and marched in parades this weekend to celebrate the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision on Friday to recognize same-sex marriage as a constitutional right.
“I literally was crying,” said Lily M. Velona ’18, who visited the Supreme Court on Friday during her lunch break. “I called my mom and my dad and the person I’m dating; it was just a really monumental time.”
Velona said people were still celebrating—many of them singing—outside the court hours after the opinion was handed down Friday morning. Later that night, Velona hosted a party in celebration of the ruling Friday night, inviting other Harvard students in the area.
On behalf of five justices, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in the Court’s majority opinion that the Constitution guarantees a fundamental right to same-sex marriage and that states must recognize same-sex unions.
Kara J.W. Lessin ’16, who was in the Supreme Court chamber when that ruling was announced, recalled her reaction.
“When I realized that what I was hearing was what I was hearing, I just started crying,” Lessin said. “I just looked around and thought: I get to be here in this moment and experience the fact that in this moment in history I was a couple hundred feet away from [Justice] Ruth Bader Ginsburg.”
Throughout the weekend, students celebrated the decision many miles away from Washington, marching in gay pride parades and attending rallies in San Francisco, New York City, and other cities across the country. And Facebook lit up with color as dozens of students changed their profile pictures rainbow in celebration.
The Boston Pride Committee hosted a rally outside the Massachusetts State House on Friday evening that featured U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, and Mary Bonauto, one of the lawyers who argued the same-sex marriage case before the Supreme Court.
“We should celebrate and rejoice, and I know we will,” Healey said at the celebration. “But I’ll tell you what: Don’t make any mistake about it. We have so much work to do. Because we know that here in this state and across this country there are LGBT young people who are looking to us who need our help. We also know we have work to do right now, right in this time, right behind us when it comes to transgender equality. And that is a fight that we’re all going to engage in.” 
David Olvera-Sanchez ’18, who was at a briefing for congressional LGBT bullying legislation when the verdict was announced, echoed Healey’s sentiment, saying that the decision was a cause to celebrate, but also a reminder of the work still needed.
