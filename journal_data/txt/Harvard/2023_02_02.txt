After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Be f-cking for real, says the small white girl with beach blonde hair and dressed head to toe in bright pink preppy clothes. “Be f-cking for real,” the newest phrase meaning “be serious,” or in response to something so incredulous it cannot be real.
Yes, “be f-cking for real” is correct. But not in the way she probably means it.
The phrase, originating from a Black woman, has now been adopted and popularized by white creators in America. There is nothing new about this phenomenon — dominant populations have co-opted minority culture, ideas, and innovation for their own use throughout recorded history — and this theft will, in all likelihood, continue to occur unless something changes.
However, this seeming inevitability should not discourage marginalized communities from fighting back, and being vigilant in protecting their intellectual property.
Perhaps the word “theft” is too strong. A more accurate term would be “borrowed,” because white creators frequently take ideas and phrases from minority communities, only to discard them and move on to the next trend. “Borrowed,” because once they get tired of playing with our culture, they throw it onto the floor, like a doll that has exhausted its temporary lifetime, and play with their other toys. All the while we, the ones who created the ideas in the first place, lie battered and used on the floor, unwanted and unseen.
African-American Vernacular English — the unique grammar, vocabulary, and accents used in Black communities — is not the only aspect of our culture that has been borrowed by white American society. The pattern extends to fashion trends as well. For example, in recent years, the aesthetic of wearing a slick bun with chunky gold hoops, which originated from Latina and Black women, has resurged into mainstream media but has been rebranded as the “clean girl” aesthetic by white women.
Another example is the trend of “Brownie glazed lips,” popularized by celebrities such as Hailey Bieber. Where this trend originated, however, goes unacknowledged by Bieber when describing a style that was seen predominantly in Black and Latina cultures throughout the 1990s. This “revamp” of Black and Latina culture, which includes the use of other “borrowed” phrases by white TikTok creators, not only erases the cultural significance of these trends but also perpetuates the marginalization of those communities.
We’re told that it’s not inherently harmful to us that these trends are being borrowed. But as Black and brown women around the world have shared tidbits of knowledge from their cultures, the tremendous oversaturation of consumer culture has made it more difficult for the people for whom the products were originally intended to acquire them.
For instance, Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Oil, a version of a product used in Black and brown cultures for generations, has found its way into white women’s hearts recently due to a video posted by the famous white TikToker Alix Earle. The problem with this recommendation is not the product itself, but that the over-purchase of this oil, designed mainly for curlier hair, in stores across America has caused the product to go scarce.
To be clear, we as Black and brown women are not trying to harm white women, or imply that they do not deserve to thicken their hair, as the oil claims that it can help them do. Instead, the issue is that since hair care companies often appear to prioritize white women, their Black and brown counterparts have less accessibility to hair care products, thus highlighting the disparities between us.
Additionally, and worryingly, some Black hair companies have in the past allegedly abandoned formulas created especially for Black hair in favor of reworking their products to appeal to a white audience, strengthening the market dominance of white women. The contagious effects of this market power lead to panic among marginalized groups to stock up on things before formulas change, which exacerbates the problem of product scarcity. The overarching domino effect set off by a single video is what minority creators have been trying to spotlight, to little avail.
The perspectives of oppressed populations must be sought out and amplified in order to remedy this problem while addressing white influencers’ liability for their behavior. White influencers should make an effort to learn about the cultural relevance of the trends they are supporting, seek out and work with creators from underrepresented groups, and utilize their influence to advance representation and equity in their fields. It is crucial that society as a whole amplifies the voices of marginalized communities within the fashion and beauty industries, for the purpose of providing fair representation, resources, and opportunities.
It isn’t difficult to solicit the perspective of the people whose culture is being appropriated before promoting a product or homogenizing a new phrase. And to those that tell us that that’s too much to ask, I say…
Be f-cking for real.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You couldn’t miss it if you tried. From YouTube adverts starring celebrity comedians to incessant news stories touting another broken price record, “it” was cryptocurrency, a movement taking the world by storm in 2021 and 2022. Largely born out of libertarian currents in the wake of the last financial crisis and limited in scope to Internet subcommunities for years, crypto had finally entered into the mainstream.
Harvard was not immune from this explosion of enthusiasm. On campus, the first-ever undergraduate organization focused on blockchain was founded, while internships and offers of employment at cryptocurrency firms became ubiquitous and irresistible.
Though the highs of 2021 have mostly subsided and the allure of a blockchain future has been greatly diminished by scandals such as the spectacular collapses of the LUNA “stablecoin” network and the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, it still remains unclear why crypto, a technology more than a decade old, was only able to have its moment in the sun over the past couple of years.
The classic answer given by pundits has been “easy money,” the notion that rock-bottom interest rates set by the Federal Reserve had made it far too tempting for deep-pocketed investors to go all in on moonshot ideas like upending the global monetary system. There may certainly be some truth to that, but it can’t explain how crypto captured the popular imagination, not to mention sovereign governments — how it was able to persuade a solid fifth of Americans and millions of others around the world, spanning across class and cultural boundaries, to risk their financial well-being for the sake of something new.
This question was somewhere in the back of my mind as I was strolling through the Harvard Art Museums toward the end of the fall semester. Having long been a nerdy numismatist, I soon found myself (again) on the third floor, gawking at the Roman coin collection, which boasts selections from the Late Republican era (1st century BCE) to the Late Antique (3rd-5th centuries BCE).
The temporal diversity of the collection makes it easy to spot clear compositional differences between coins cast at the opposite ends of the Pax Romana. And while it might not be fair to assume so at first glance, the quality of the coins differ significantly too. By and large, Roman coins, being minted by a central imperial authority, consistently underwent a process of debasement as a smaller and smaller amount of precious metals were used in their manufacture. For instance, whereas the silver denarius was 94 percent pure during the reign of Nero (54 – 68 CE), coins minted by Claudius Victorinus when he ascended to the throne two centuries later in 268 CE were basically junk metal, containing only 0.02 percent of real silver. To many emperors, the logic was simple. Expensive wars required costly expenditures, and what was easier — raising (and collecting) taxes or simply keeping more bullion in the public coffers by reducing how much was spent on currency?
While the thesis that this regular debasement over centuries contributed to the ultimate downfall of the Roman state is hotly debated, the notion that the practice was common knowledge among the populus Romanus is more widely acknowledged. Salaries provided to regular soldiers steadily increased as coin purity decreased, while auxiliary forces recruited from “barbarian” forces increasingly demanded their pay in pure gold form. The once-unquestioned authority of the Roman state to control the mediums of exchange in its sphere of influence was gradually shredded to tatters.
Among the many parallels that politicians and thinkers so often draw between the Roman world and ours, especially with respect to the dominating nature of American cultural influence, perhaps one that should be heeded with caution is the loss of public trust in the Roman “financial” system and the one that we live with today. While there are certainly very significant differences in their respective architectures — namely that we no longer seek to chain our monetary supply with the availability of precious specie — surely we can compare the qualities of public sentiment.
After all, money still largely serves the same social functions in our world as it did in our forefathers’, and as with any medium of exchange, unanimous agreement about the value of money is absolutely essential to its continued survival. Once collective trust in its worth erodes beyond some critical point, individuals may be incentivized to seek alternatives. While the Romans may have found refuge in the visible constancy of aurum, as many “gold bugs” still do today, crypto seems to be the new, very popular, kid on the block.
Indeed, it doesn’t seem coincidental that a mass media motif that was just as pervasive recently as the rise of cryptocurrency was the imminent threat of inflationary pressures in the United States and globally. Think-tankers lined up to provide their version of how rising prices came to be, with some pointing back to the “easy money” policies of central banks and others blaming everything from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine. What was much less disputed was the effects of inflation on the average psyche, as popular discontent shot upward, fueled by the widely held belief that central authorities were to blame somehow for the newfound crisis.
Framed in these terms, it may be much less of a mystery why cryptocurrency has appealed to so many so recently. It has been, in essence, a passive revolt against establishment institutions, driven by the same kind of sentiment and notions of a “break from the big banks” that drove thousands to Occupy Wall Street more than a decade ago.
Yes, crypto’s fifteen minutes of fame has likely elapsed, but extensive mistrust of the present financial status quo lingers. Public policy must thus be willing to address these eddies of economic disaffection, lest our currency too goes the way of the Romans’.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, over 100 students, activists, and labor leaders surged into Northwest Building classroom B108 — before walking right back out again.
They were protesting professor John L. Comaroff’s return to teaching. Years ago, multiple graduate students accused the African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor of sexual harassment, provoking intense uproar. For the second semester in a row, Comaroff is back in the classroom, while students chant in unison, fervently hoping that their voices — loud as ever — might just induce the administration to act.
Last semester, it was graduate students; this time, it’s undergrads too. In the long fight against this alleged abuser, we must all continue to beat the drum until justice is won.
Thank you for your strength. You are an inspiration to us all in the ongoing quest for justice.
Thank you for your determination. When our supposed role models in the administration and faculty fail, the project of creating a safe campus regrettably falls on you. As you’re fighting an uphill battle, feeling dejected about the change that never seems to come, your fingers numbing from protesting outside during a frigid Boston winter, know that your fellow students appreciate — no, need — your activism. Maintaining a years-long battle for accountability for sexual harassment and discrimination in the public conscious takes strength and perseverance, which you have wielded powerfully against our institution.
Resign.
As educators, you have a dual obligation to both teach us and keep us safe. Students have made it clear that they feel Comaroff’s position on campus poses an active threat to their safety. They need your support. Call for Comaroff’s resignation. Take a stand. Use the power of your position — that same power Comaroff supposedly abused to harass students — to foster a safer campus and a more just world.
Your silence reeks of negligence and lends tacit approval to Comaroff’s actions. Instead of disregarding the voices of the hundreds of protesters and the staggeringly low enrollment in Comaroff’s courses, perhaps listen to student voices when they feel unsafe.
Revoke Comaroff’s tenure. When tenure rules render professors unfireable, what purpose do Title IX and other accountability measures even serve? While this undoubtedly lengthy process unfolds, also ensure that the College offers alternatives to Comaroff’s courses, so that no African and African American Studies concentrators are stuck between two terrible options: either navigating the unwieldy schedule-change process, or worse, taking a course with an accused sexual predator.
This is an opportunity to set the tone of your new presidential administration. Show us that President Gay’s Harvard is no place for harassment or discrimination of any kind. Comaroff is part of a larger culture of harassment on campus; it is high time we reckon with this pervasive problem. Students and faculty, partnering hand-in-hand with university leadership, must come together to implement a zero-tolerance policy for sexual misconduct.
We urge your incoming administration to pursue every avenue of change necessary to ensure this vision. Demand Comaroff’s immediate resignation. Hire other academics who study Comaroff’s areas of expertise. Scholarship in these areas is valuable, but we need not compromise our safety to gain his knowledge.
As you prepare to begin your new role, we are similarly preparing to engage in the timeless tug of war between idealistic student protesters and wary university administration that influences all action taken on this campus. But it’s not push and pull if you never budge. In your upcoming term, we hope you will find yourself swayed by student protesters as they raise critical consequential issues, including this one — student safety is at stake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newly-announced Harvard Institute of Politics spring 2023 resident fellows discussed the divisiveness in current American politics at their inaugural JFK Jr. Forum on Wednesday.
IOP Interim Director Setti D. Warren moderated the panel discussion between the fellows, who were announced last month and include eminent political figures and state representatives. Some of Setti’s questions centered around bipartisanship and the panelists’ views on the political atmosphere leading up to the 2024 election.
Quentin Fulks, the political strategist and campaign manager for recently elected senator Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.), talked about the importance of listening to voters.
“Regardless of how partisan or rigid the electorate is, voters are complex — they are listening,” Fulks said. “People have gone through a lot over the past couple of years with Covid, but they really care about who represents them.”
Chief Counsel of the Republican National Committee Matthew Raymer, whose family members sat in the front row, asked the audience to raise their hands if they had ever been to a meeting of their state or county political party.
“When you talk about politics in this country, I think it’s really important to remember that the future belongs to the people who show up, and it belongs to the people who are going to put in the work, who are going to take part in the stuff that’s not fun,” Raymer said.
Jamie Herrera Beutler — one of the 10 Republican representatives who voted to impeach former President Donald J. Trump – said she would be discussing the value of respecting diverse opinions in her upcoming study groups.
“I really, truly believe we have to get back to the point where we have healthy governing officials,” she said.
“We also need to value one another,” she added.
Other fellows who participated in the discussion included Kristin L. Amerling ’87, the chief counsel and deputy staff director to the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol; Negah Angha, former director for multilateral initiatives for the National Security Council; and Jason Rezaian, an opinion columnist for the Washington Post who was detained in Iran for 544 days.
Jonathan Haileselassie ’26, who attended the forum, said he found the wide political spectrum represented by the fellows interesting.
“It was really cool seeing all that diverse thought,” he said. “Seeing how successful they’ve all been able to be just by following their belief to the fullest extent possible — it was really inspiring.”
Attendee Kimani E. Panthier ’24 said the group has a broader policy scope compared to that of previous fellow cohorts. He said he hoped the fellows will be “authentic” and engage with young voters.
“As we head into 2024, I want to hear how we can change the tide of what’s been happening in politics so that we can mobilize younger voters to have more of a say,” Panthier said.
Tenzin R. Gund-Morrow ’26, a Crimson editorial editor and IOP Fellow and Study Groups’ co-director of community, said he “loved” the forum and looks forward to the fellows becoming more candid with the smaller study groups.
“Having a forum with six people is never really going to let you take full advantage of the people, but the best part is that we have a whole semester to continue taking advantage of having them on campus,” Gund-Morrow said.

Brenda D. Tindal will serve as the inaugural chief campus curator for Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences starting Feb. 13, FAS Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay wrote in an email Wednesday.
The chief campus curator role was created at the recommendation of the FAS Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage in December 2021. The novel role entails reevaluating and modernizing the University’s historical and cultural spaces, signs, and curricula.
“The visual culture and signage across Harvard communicates what our institution values, who it celebrates, and the kind of community we aim to foster,” Gay wrote in the email. “This appointment is an opportunity to revitalize Harvard’s shared spaces in order to acknowledge the past, while celebrating the diversity of the present and promoting the vitality of the future.”
Since May 2021, Tindal has worked as the executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture.
Tindal has also served on the Human Remains in the Harvard Museums Collections Returns Committee and the Legacy of Slavery Memorial Project. She has advised engagements between HMSC and Indigenous groups and descendants of enslaved people, Gay said in the email, areas where Harvard museums have faced ethical and legal criticisms for their handling of human remains and cultural objects.
Tindal will have primary oversight of different aspects of the FAS’ campus, such as landscaping, architecture, gates, public art, interior design, and portraiture.
“If we desire to be a campus that embodies inclusive excellence and engenders a sense of belonging for an inherently global and diverse community of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and visitors, the essence of the campus — its visual culture, way-finding, interior and exterior aesthetics, and place-making attributes — must reflect those noble aspirations,” Tindal said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette.
She will launch her duties as chief campus curator by overseeing a campaign of “renewal efforts” for the FAS Faculty Room, Annenberg Hall, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Center, according to Gay’s email.
The task force identified these as “priority spaces” and described the rooms as “dominated by homogenous portraiture of white men” in their report. Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, displays 23 portraits. All but three depict white men.
The initial task force was launched in September 2020 as a part of a push by the FAS to advance racial justice following George Floyd’s murder by police. Its recommendations include representing a more diverse range of people and experiences in art around campus and using technology to expand on campus tours and historical signage.
Reporting to FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Scott A. Jordan, Tindal will be advised by the new FAS Committee on Visual Culture and Signage, chaired by Dan Byers, director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts.

Mary “Gwen” Knapp ’83 — a sports journalist at The Harvard Crimson, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times — died on Jan. 20 at age 61 after a year-long battle with lymphoma.
Long-time friend and former classmate Nancy W. Boutilier ’83 first met Knapp during a rain delay under the scorer’s table at a 1981 Harvard softball game. Boutilier was pitching, and Knapp was covering the game for The Crimson.
“Her intensity, curiosity, and passion for sports drew me in from the get-go! It didn’t take but 5 minutes with Gwen to know she was brilliant!” Boutilier wrote in an email.
Known for her column in the San Francisco Chronicle that ran from 2000 to 2012, Knapp covered sports and its intersections with contentious topics ranging from racism to doping to homophobia.
Before her career as a professional sportswriter, Knapp got her start as an associate sports editor of The Crimson. In addition to covering athletics on campus, Knapp swam for the women’s swimming and diving team.
Claudia S. Leonard ’83, one of Knapp’s freshman-year roommates, remembers meeting her on move-in day into 33 Matthews South, their dorm in Harvard Yard.
“She might have looked soft and sweet at that first encounter, and little did I know at that first meeting, the kind of ferocity that she had underneath,” Leonard said.
Knapp's friends and family said she was known for her integrity and strong ethical reporting standards — traits that extended to her personal life.
In 2001, Knapp questioned the legitimacy of former cyclist Lance E. Armstrong’s numerous wins 12 years before he admitted to his use of performance-enhancing drugs in his Tour de France victories.
Caroline A. Miller ’83, a friend from the swim team, said she was unsurprised to read about the Armstrong story in an obituary for Knapp.
“I just laughed because that was Gwen,” she said.
“I admired her because so many women — still at that time — would just kind of give in to make nice, and Gwen was somebody who did not care about whether or not other people were gonna agree with her,” Miller added. “She just always held hotly-contested opinions about everything.”
One of Gwen Knapp’s younger sisters, Rebecca Knapp Adams, said that Gwen Knapp’s bold reporting stemmed from her ethical fortitude.
“If you knew Gwen, if you worked with Gwen, if you had any relationship with Gwen, you understood that she was without guile and that the demands and the determination and persistence did not come from a place of ego at all,” she said. “It came from a desire to do the right thing, to see the right thing done.”
Alongside her commitment to covering injustice in the sports world, Knapp remained a persistent optimist, according to Leonard.
“She would assume the best,” she said. “Despite the fact that she always had something that was distressing her about the state of the world — some injustice — she still was at heart a complete optimist.”
“She laughed loud, argued fiercely, and worked really hard at everything,” Miller added.
Lawrence R. “Larry” Countryman ’83 first met Knapp during the eighth grade after joining the swim team at their middle school in Delaware.
Though they attended different high schools, they kept in touch through their arrival at Harvard, where they both swam at the varsity level.
Countryman recalled that when Knapp was covering the 2000 Sydney Olympics, she called him during the men’s 1500-meter freestyle so he could hear the race.
Countryman had been a distance freestyle swimmer, and he lauded Knapp’s propensity for remembering “little things” about others and including them in experiences she knew they would enjoy.
“She wanted to make sure you were taken care of, that you were part of the thing — whatever that thing was,” he said.
“I’m never gonna forget about that,” he added.
Countryman also spoke fondly of Knapp’s “loyalty” and generosity.
When his mother fell ill and he needed to travel back home, he said Knapp told him, “just get to the airport tomorrow morning — there’ll be a ticket there for you.”
The oldest of four sisters, Knapp is remembered as an impactful mentor — both formally and informally.
One of Knapp’s youngest sisters, Adams, said that Gwen was always the exemplar of a big sister.
“The role of big sister was really important to her. She really saw it as a responsibility to all of us,” she said. “I think she also — whether this was conscious or not — was a real role model.”
Adams added that when working as a swim coach during the summer, Knapp would seek out kids that needed a “big sister figure.”
Susan Knapp McClements, the second-oldest sister, said Knapp served as “an amazing mentor” to all of her sisters’ children.
During her time in San Francisco, Knapp volunteered as a tutor at A Home Away from Homelessness, a nonprofit organization providing unhoused children with mentorship, tutoring, counseling, and legal aid.
Reverend Alyson Jacks, the director of volunteer services and mentorship during Knapp’s time there, said she was an invaluable volunteer.
“She just was one of those volunteers when you’re so lucky to have them, who was consistent, showed up, didn’t bring a lot of pretentious assumptions about anything, and was really just there to be of support to the kids and bring her sense of curiosity and love of life and love of learning,” she said.
Nancy Knapp Piccione, another sister of Gwen Knapp’s, said Gwen Knapp enjoyed her time with the children at the nonprofit beyond her role as a tutor.
“I think she obviously was a role model and an adult who took care of them, but I think she loved being at their level and understanding their lives and joking around with them and supporting them.”
Gwen Knapp is survived by her three sisters, as well as her father, Laurence Knapp.
Countryman said Gwen Knapp’s legacy is rooted in her trailblazing journalistic career as a female sportswriter who always strove for fairness and truth.
“Gwen always strived to do something that was different and wanted to be good at it and wanted to excel and get things right,” he said.
“I think going into sports for her was sort of, ‘Hey, people don’t expect this from women, and I’m going to show them that women can,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard Quincy House resident Mia A. Colman ’23-’24 returned to campus for the spring semester, she was surprised to find her bedding in a plastic bag.
Next to the bag was a letter from Quincy Building Manager Dick Nerden, which stated that a pest control service had found mouse droppings on the bed and proceeded to vacuum the excrement and place traps in the room.
Shortly after reading the note, Colman said she had a surprise encounter with one of the trespassers.
“There was a mouse who was half-alive stuck in one of the glue traps that had been put in,” she said. “It was actually kind of sad.”
“It was kind of cute, but it definitely had been through it,” she added.
A number of rooms in the New Quincy residence hall of Quincy have been plagued by a rodent infestation going back to at least last November, prompting surprise and disgust from several residents who reported mice and droppings in their living spaces.
Cole H. Petersen ’23, who has also been dealing with mice since last semester, said there were four dead mice in one of the rooms of his suite when he returned from winter break.
“There was one living in a food container that was closed that jumped out at us,” he said. “You hear them in the radiators at night — which is not great.”
Petersen also said there was a mouse living in his roommate’s room, which left droppings in his sheets and “all over his room.”
“The mice are in the dining hall at night — you can see them very openly, out in the open — just running around,” he added.
In a Jan. 26 email to residents, Nerden said Quincy is working with a pest control company and Harvard’s Environmental Health and Safety team to address the ongoing issues.
Nerden also advised residents to be “extremely diligent” about avoiding leaving food and trash in their suites and asked affected dorms to report sightings through the house’s work request system.
Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement that the residential facilities team is working to address concerns in Quincy “quickly and thoroughly.”
“Ensuring a clean and healthy living space for all students is always a priority,” he wrote. “Several steps are being taken to mitigate the issue, including the assignment of pest control and custodial crews making regular visits and treating points of entry.”
Quincy resident Chloe S. Wilson ’24 said she and her suitemates have implemented additional rodent countermeasures, including draft protectors to prevent movement between rooms and devices that repel mice with high sound frequencies.
Still, Wilson said her efforts have been largely ineffective.
“One time we literally saw one of the mice jump over the trap,” she said. “These are smart mice.”
Annika S. Huprikar ’24 said the mice have led her suite to make late-night calls to pest control and devise homemade traps.
“We even tried making one of our own traps with peanut butter from the dining hall,” Huprikar said.
Quincy resident Nabin Poudel ’24 wrote in an email that he originally thought the house was “rodent-resistant” after sightings were confined to the courtyard, but he later spotted a mouse in his third-floor common room in the fall.
“Over winter break, I spotted two more rodents, which were smaller, and probably rats,” Poudel wrote. “I haven’t noticed any damage so far, except the occasional surprise that we get.”
Poudel added that he has not seen any rats since the start of the semester.
Huprikar said Quincy has been proactive in entering suites to address a problem that has become “widespread” in some parts of the house.
“They’ve been entering all the suites this entire week to just sort of assess what is going on and where the problem could be,” she said.
Though Petersen said “the house has been pretty good” about attempting to deter the mice from entering residents’ dorms, he said the problem has “definitely gotten worse” since November.
“It’s just not great to be sharing a living space with them,” Petersen said.

Members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, contributed more than $1.5 million in political donations to federal candidates and political action committees in 2021 and 2022. Of that number, just $12,900 went to Republican political causes.
Members on the 13-person board donated overwhelmingly to Democratic causes ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, according to The Crimson’s analysis of Federal Election Commission data.
The Harvard Corporation is the most powerful governing body at Harvard, participating in major decisions on the University’s direction and endowment. With the exception of outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow, all Corporation members served on the presidential search committee that selected President-elect Claudine Gay.
Within the Corporation’s ranks are two former Obama administration officials, two billionaires, and three heads of private investment firms. Ahead of the 2020 election, Corporation members financed over $1 million to Democratic campaigns and PACs.
Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Obama, contributed the most out of the board’s members, supplying Democratic causes with more than $750,000 ahead of the 2022 midterms. She gave similarly in the 2020 election cycle, with $861,000 in support of Democratic candidates.
Pritzker, who joined the Corporation in 2018, became the first woman to serve as senior fellow on July 1, succeeding former Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 after he reached the 12-year term limit for Corporation members. Part of one of America’s wealthiest families, Pritzker has a net worth of $3.1 billion. Jay Robert “J.B.” Pritzker, Pritzker’s younger brother, has served as governor of Illinois since 2019.
Paul J. Finnegan ’75 was the sole Corporation member to support Republican candidates, giving $5,000 to former U.S. Representative Adam D. Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and $2,900 to Jesse L. Reising, who lost in the 2022 Republican primary in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District. Finnegan also contributed $5,000 to Kinzinger’s PAC.
Kinzinger voted to impeach former President Donald J. Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection and served on the House Jan. 6 Select Committee investigating the attack on the Capitol.
Finnegan also supported several Democratic candidates with total contributions of over $20,000, including contributing $5,000 to the campaign of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).
Finnegan also contributed $155,000 to PACs that support a bipartisan group of candidates.
Collectively, members of the Corporation donated more than $800,000 to the Democratic National Committee and its Congressional and Senate campaign arms. They also contributed more than $110,000 to various Democratic PACs.
Other Corporation members who donated to political campaigns include Theodore V. Wells, Timothy R. Barakett ’87, Kenneth I. Chenault, and Diana L. Nelson ’84. Besides Pritzker, Chenault led the group with nearly $400,000 worth of contributions to political campaigns.
The Crimson did not find records of political spending from other members of the Harvard Corporation ahead of the 2022 midterms, including billionaire David M. Rubenstein.
Rubenstein is a close friend of President Joe Biden. During the first two years of his presidency, Biden stayed at Rubenstein’s Nantucket home for Thanksgiving.
Bacow has not contributed to political campaigns since he took office in Massachusetts Hall in 2018, according to FEC reports. Prior to his appointment to Harvard’s top post, Bacow funded Democratic candidates, including Hillary R. Clinton and Michael S. Dukakis.
Incoming University President Claudine Gay has not made any recorded political contributions in her career, according to FEC data.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment for the article.
Methodology
The Crimson compiled data for this analysis from publicly available Federal Election Commission records of contributions to federal election candidates and political action committees. Contribution records were compiled for current members of the Harvard Contribution, including all known variants of names, and cross-checked against publicly available occupation data. Federal election laws require donors to truthfully disclose their occupation and employer.
Federal law also requires the disclosure of political spending exceeding $200 on a single candidate within an election cycle. The data do not include contributions made to independent expenditure campaigns, super PACs, or nonprofit groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code which engage in electioneering communications.

UPDATED: February 2, 2023, at 9:48 p.m.
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf is forcing out online misinformation expert Joan M. Donovan from her role at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and ending her research project, according to three HKS staff members with knowledge of the situation.
Donovan was told she has until summer 2024 to end the Technology and Social Change project and depart from her role at HKS, according to the staff members. Donovan, who is not a tenure-track professor, has led the project since its inception in 2019 and serves as the Shorenstein Center’s research director. Donovan has also taught at HKS as an adjunct lecturer in public policy.
In addition, Donovan was told her prominence at the school led Elmendorf to end her time at the Shorenstein Center, two HKS staff members said.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith confirmed in an emailed statement that the project is ending.
“The Technology and Social Change project is winding down — through an extended transition — because it does not have intellectual and academic leadership by a full HKS faculty member, as required of all long-term research and outreach projects at HKS,” Smith wrote.
As part of the School’s decision to end the Technology and Social Change project, Donovan is not allowed to raise new funding, according to the three HKS staff members. The project is also facing a hiring freeze and spending constraints on existing funding, the staff members said.
Donovan declined to comment on her status at HKS and the termination of her project.
Donovan received her Ph.D. in sociology and science studies from the University of California San Diego in 2015, before joining the Data and Society Research Institute in 2016, where she served as research lead on a team studying media manipulation.
In 2019, Donovan joined the Shorenstein Center to serve as the director and lead researcher of the Technology and Social Change project.
At Harvard, Donovan was a leading force in bringing the study of misinformation and disinformation to prominence in academia. Donovan has testified in front of House and Senate subcommittees on the spread of misinformation online.
Tensions between Elmendorf and Donovan rose in fall 2021, according to three HKS staff members, around when Donovan started to work on HKS’ Facebook archive project, fbarchive.org. The archive will provide researchers and journalists with access to photos of documents obtained by Frances B. Haugen, the 2021 Facebook whistleblower who disclosed internal Facebook research on its technologies’ negative effects.
A year later, at the start of the fall 2022 semester, Donovan was informed that the Technology and Social Change project would ultimately end in summer 2024.
In mid-September 2022, HKS professor Latanya A. Sweeney joined Donovan as co-principal investigator for the Technology and Social Change project, the first time Donovan was not its sole head.
Donovan taught the HKS course Democracy, Politics and Institutions 622: “Media Manipulation and Disinformation Campaigns” and co-authored a widely-read study in July 2022 that found a plurality of participants in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol were motivated by their support for Trump. In September 2022, Donovan published a book titled “Meme Wars: The Untold Story of the Online Battles Upending Democracy in America” about the online spread of right-wing media political conspiracy theories.
Smith, an HKS spokesperson, wrote in the statement that the school is continuing to promote scholarship in the field of misinformation and disinformation.
“Harvard Kennedy School is committed to the teaching and study of misinformation and disinformation, and several faculty members are leading significant projects that address these topics,” he wrote.
In a Thursday morning email obtained by The Crimson, Shorenstein Center Director Nancy R. Gibbs wrote to center affiliates that the decision to shut down the Technology and Social Change project was “solely driven” by HKS policy of only allowing full professors to lead research projects.
“While there can be limited exceptions, those can't continue indefinitely without a faculty member as the principal project leader and academic head,” Gibbs wrote in the email.
Donovan declined to comment on the contents of the letter.
The Technology and Social Change project — which lists a team of more than 25 people on its website including staff, fellows, contributing researchers, and research assistants — has been led by Donovan since 2019.
Gibbs sent the email hours after The Crimson first reported that HKS would end the Technology and Social Change project by summer 2024.
Gibbs wrote that other initiatives led by faculty members related to the study of misinformation and disinformation would continue at the Shorenstein Center, including the Facebook archive project and the Misinformation Review, an online academic journal.
In recent weeks, Elmendorf has been the subject of controversy.
He faced backlash in January over his rejection of a fellowship for former Human Rights Watch head Kenneth Roth. Elmendorf, who allegedly blocked Roth over anti-Israel criticism, reversed his decision after more than 1,000 Harvard affiliates signed an open letter calling for his resignation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend the hot, humid atmosphere of Blodgett Pool was especially active as both the Men’s and Women’s Swim and Dive teams competed in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Meet.
On Friday, the men’s team came out hot right away, with seniors Umit Guresand and Ryan Linnihan, first-year David Greely, and junior Marcus Holmquist winning the 200 meter freestyle relay by almost a second.
While the Crimson did not keep up their blistering early pace, Harvard (7-0) would still end up winning four out of the 10 events that night.
On Saturday, the Crimson again started strong with another relay win. Harvard also emerged victorious in the 1m dive event, with sophomore Adam Wesson clinching the win. This came after Wesson fell to the Tigers’(7-3, 5-2 Ivy league) Taso Callanan on Friday evening in the 3 meter. Junior Will Grant also displayed backstroke prowess, winning two backstroke events by a second each.
Coming into H-Y-P, Holmquist was not feeling 100%, but he still had an especially eventful meet.
“I was a little bit more nervous than usual. I had some issues with illnesses the previous week and felt pretty bad in the water. But once I got to the competition, I turned my brain off and went on autopilot,” Holmquist said.
After winning the opening relay, Holmquist also anchored the final relay. This race was set to decide the meet between the Crimson and the Tigers, who were tied coming into the final stretch.
“Relays capture why I love swimming, because it brings the team aspect to the sport. It is all about stepping up when it matters the most,” he continued.
Holmquist realized that Harvard needed to win the race to win the meet, but he did not realize that they were down by a third of a second as he entered the pool.
“I kind of saw that we were trailing a little bit but came in with confidence and realized that regardless of who is next to me, I could beat them if I swam my own race. I tried not to over swim the first 35 yards, I turned at the fifty and saw that I was catching up, and put on the jets.”
Harvard won the race by a flat second, and the Crimson ended up edging the Tigers 181-172 while decisively beating the Bulldogs 239-113. The victory represented Harvard’s fifth straight win in the HYP meet.
Later that day, Harvard Women’s Swim and Dive (6-2, 5-2) took to the pool. Coming into the meet with an undefeated record on the year, a loss to both the Bulldogs (9-0, 7-0) and the Tigers (8-3, 4-3) might seem like a disappointment for the Crimson. However, coach Stephanie Morawski ‘92 had a specific strategy in mind for HYP.
“It may not have been what we wanted but the score was what we expected,” the coach of 26 seasons said. "We have one goal in mind and that is winning another Ivy Championship. We want to make sure that physically, mentally, and emotionally, we are ready.”
But Coach Morawski was quick to highlight that this meet had another special point of significance for the team, as it also represented Senior Night. Since the teams (male and female) can only continue to the Ivy League championships with a smaller team, this also marks the last time some of the seniors would swim.
“They did an amazing job, and we were 100 percent behind them,” Coach Morawski said. “These seniors have had the unique experience of Swimming with us before, during and post COVID.”
For senior captain Evie Geier, the last day of the meet was a difficult one.
“[Saturday] was difficult, we got to the end and knew it would be our last meet at home. But, we are surrounded by some of the best teammates and best women at Harvard,” Geier said. “Definitely on my last dive I had tears welling up, but I was able to push through and finish strong,” she continued.
Geier finished Saturday’s 1 meter dive in sixth place, with a score of 266.70.
This meet did have one especially bright spot on the scoreboard for the women’s team, and that came from sophomore Mandy Brenner.
Brenner, a Crimson sports editor, won the 50 freestyle race, setting a new personal collegiate record of 22.89 seconds.
“The nerves were high but having the team behind me definitely felt good,” Brenner said..
Having this time in the books before the Ivy league championship was especially meaningful to the sophomore.
“HYP is a practice run for the Ivy’s. Having this race, and being nervous for the race gets me in the mental mode for Ivies, and I feel very good about that,” she remarked.
Next up for both teams is the Ivy League Conference championship at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island on Feb. 13 and 20th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2022-23 Harvard women’s basketball team (12-7 overall, 5-2 Ivy League) is not what it used to be: with a new coaching staff, four first-year players, and frequent injuries, this season has surely been a test of its ability to adapt to incessant change.
Despite having a different starting lineup in nearly every game for the past few months, the team has managed to find consistent success. Its Ivy season commenced with a 67-59 defeat of Princeton on December 31 before securing another league victory under its belt, a mighty 30-point win against Brown on January 6, 89-59.
But Harvard’s wins have not come without some grit. With 14 players on the roster, only seven to eight have been able to dress for the majority of the games, leaving Head Coach Carrie Moore a short rotation in her first year leading the Crimson. This has put an extensive amount of pressure on the active players since Ivy games are important deciders for which of the Ancient Eight will make it to the league’s tournament in mid-March, which will be hosted by Princeton this year.
“We had seven [players] against Dartmouth and that was tough,” team captain and senior guard Maggie McCarthy recalled. “I remember our coaches were like, ‘We just have to get through this.’ They’re important wins right now at this point in the season, we’re trying to get everyone healthy for the end of the season, including myself.”
McCarthy, who is also a midfielder for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, suffered a foot injury in November at an 85-63 loss to Purdue in the Cancun Challenge tournament in Mexico, putting her on the bench for the entire month of December. In an unlucky play, the captain fractured her foot by stepping on another player’s foot when changing directions but ended up playing on it for the rest of the game.
This fracture was not the end of the Medfield native’s injuries in her final season for the Crimson. At Harvard’s most recent 66-53 triumph against Cornell — in which only eight players dressed — McCarthy broke her wrist just after her foot healed. In an attempt to draw a charge on defense, a Big Red opponent knocked the senior down, forcing her to use her wrist to break the fall. Despite the break, she wrapped it up and returned to the court, playing the remainder of the game somewhat one-handed.
“When I had my foot injury, I was like ‘Oh okay, I’ll be back for [the] Ivy League [season],’” the captain said. “It's kind of what you work for the whole year, and just because we’re so well matched up and so much goes into it.”
“It just reiterates the fact that every Ivy game is so important because the standings get so close, so every win matters and it makes it that much more competitive.”
Currently, the Crimson has only two injured bodies: McCarthy and first-year guard Gabby Anderson. Naturally, these two players happen to be two of the team’s strongest starters. Anderson, a first-year guard hailing from Columbus, Ohio, tore her ACL at the beginning of the fall, keeping her off the court for the rest of the year. This ebb and flow of injury and recovery have encapsulated the team’s rhythm thus far.
“That's been the theme of the season, honestly – people are in and out, so it's kind of like winning anyway we can at this point – it doesn’t really matter what it looks like. Just be tough, go out there, and play for the people that are injured.”
In particular, one challenge Harvard has faced is not knowing which players will suit up for a given game, while other teams have the benefit of playing with a consistent starting lineup. McCarthy noted that this has been a particular trial for Harvard’s offense.
“If you play with the same people over the course of three months, your offense is going to flow and look so good because you know where each other are. The fact that literally every week in practice and every game we don’t know who’s suiting up has changed so much, but we’re still able to find that chemistry.”
Most recently, Harvard delivered a 24-point victory over Penn on January 28. In a game staffed with many fans and students, the Crimson seemed to feed off the energy of the crowd. But the captain credits that win to the preparation they did in practice that week.
“How we play in that game is based on how we prepare in practice that week,” McCarthy commented. “I think this week we were super hype, super connected, we had a lot of good competitive drills in practice, and we were competing.”
Perhaps that is what has kept the team chemistry despite all of the adversity faced this season: sticking to the competition in practices.
“I think that competition brings out the best athletes in us and that turns into chemistry,” McCarthy reflected. “Competition brings out good team chemistry.”
Due to the myriad of injuries, the Crimson has run through many possible starting line-ups, meaning that most of its roster is comfortable playing with one another and in strenuous situations. This type of conditioning may lead to increased agility and adaptability ahead of the Ivy games near the end of this season when more players return to full health.
“The hope is that, by the end of the season, we have as many healthy bodies as we can – that will make the win so much sweeter,” the senior guard said. “That’s even what gets me through my injury now, is still believing or visualizing winning in the end – it'll all be worth it.”
But at the helm of these challenges has been a new coaching staff, spearheaded by Coach Carrie Moore — one that has brought excitement, new energy, and motivation, keeping the team in an upward direction no matter the game at hand.
“They came in really ambitious, in a good way,” McCarthy reflected. “We’ve always wanted to win a championship here, so I think having the new coaching staff on board with that is really great this year.”
Moore was named the head coach for Harvard last spring, taking over for long-time Harvard legend Kathy Delaney-Smith. The Michigan native, who has a long resume of accomplishments in athletics and even led the nation in scoring her senior year at Western Michigan University, refuses to let adversity get to her players’ heads.
“Our team saying, what Coach Moore came in with, is ‘Believe it,’” McCarthy said. “We have that on some of our gear and we say it in all of our huddles before we break.”
“I think just really believing despite all of the adversity we’ve faced — believing in the process and believing we can win a championship — that’s what keeps us together, even in the hard times.”
Many of the Crimson’s starters and leading scorers air on the younger side. Sophomore guard Harmoni Turner averages a team-high 17.6 points per game, while her backcourt-mate and fellow sophomore Elena Rodriguez has increased her scoring average from 2.0 in the 2021-2022 season to 11.6 this year. Though these newer players have had to face a learning curve of adjusting to collegiate basketball, older players have had to adapt to a new program direction entirely: one aimed at an Ivy League championship win. The emergence of younger players, such as first-year guard Saniyah Glenn-Bello, has encouraged senior guard McKenzie Forbes and junior guard Lola Mullaney to elevate their games, as well.
But with the injuries has arisen a new type of leadership from the team: injured players stepping into the role of student coaches. Senior guard Annie Stritzel has built a strong career for the Crimson program, first emerging as a versatile scorer and tough defensive player as a first-year in 2019-2020. This March, however, Stritzel announced she had been managing the pain of a diagnosed, career-ending ankle injury since her arrival in Cambridge. With the injury mounting in severity throughout last season, Stritzel will be unable to take the floor for Harvard in her final year of eligibility. But her ankle injury has not stopped her from pivoting into a new, crucial role for her team.
“[Stritzel] can’t play anymore, so she’s kind of like a player-coach for us,” McCarthy said. “But she has been so invested, so involved, and such a great role model for the younger players too. Having that player-coach role is really valuable to us.”
Next up for the Crimson is a weekend road trip to New Haven where it will seek revenge against the Bulldogs. When Harvard last met Yale, a single point kept the Crimson from winning in a 71-70 battle on the court.
When asked about that game, McCarthy joked, “Don’t bring it up.”
“We’re going to get our revenge,” the captain declared. “It will be very similar to the way we went into Penn. We know it's a huge game, [we’re] definitely in the stretch right now, we have seven more Ivy League games — every win matters.”
This time around, it seems that the Crimson have been armed with healthier bodies and an idea of what it is up against in Connecticut.
“I don’t know if we went in too lightly our first time or what it was, but there’s no chance we’d ever make that mistake.”
Harvard will take on Yale at 6:00 PM EST this Friday before swinging up to the Ocean State for a Saturday evening matchup against the Bears at 5:00 PM EST.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping the first match of their Ivy League campaign to No. 5 Cornell, the Harvard wrestling team made a resounding statement on Friday night in its 20-18 defeat of Princeton for the first time in a decade. The dynamic of the sport has allowed for many individual successes over the course of the season but wins like this are a special reflection of team culture and commitment.
The effort that went into this weekend began back in September and lasted throughout the fall. The Crimson consists of a young, talented group, made up of sixteen underclassmen. On Friday night, three underclassmen in the lineup – first-years Joseph Cangro, Jack Crook, and sophomore Diego Sotelo – all had key victories over the Tigers.
Longtime head coach Jay Weiss credits hard work in the off-season to this season's successes.
“I felt that they were going to be a lot different in the second semester, and they are – they're wrestling a lot better,” Weiss reflected. “A good two, three months of training and repeating, and then all of a sudden, January, February rolls around and they’re ready to go. So I was pretty pleased.”
The Crimson won six of the ten matches against the Tigers, securing victories at the 125, 141, 149, 157, 174, and 285-pound weight classes. Cangro won by major decision in his home state of N.J. at 141 lbs, as well as senior Trevor Tarsi at 157 lbs.
Sotelo (11-5), who is ranked 22nd in the nation at 125 lbs, remained unbeaten in Ivy League matches, blanking Princeton’s junior Nick Kayal 6-0. The Plainfield, Ill. native, who was injured last season, has been eager to make his mark and step up for the Harvard wrestling program.
“Being able to come back with more drive on my part and being able to be in a room every day with my teammates and my coaches has been great,” said Sotelo when asked about his successes thus far and looking forward. “I feel we've been making big jumps as a team – ​​I'm really excited to make a big statement for myself and for the team.”
Philip Conigliaro, who is ranked No. 21 at 174 lbs, returned to Harvard’s mat for the first time in 2023 after a knee injury kept him from competition, earning his first dual win in the process. Last season, the Dedham, Mass. local won the EIWA title and First Team All-Ivy Honors, securing himself a spot at the NCAA Championships, where he ultimately fell to national runner-up Shane Griffith of Stanford, posting a 3-2 mark. Prior to the NCAA tournament, the captain held an impressive 11-1 record in his matches for the season.
“[Conigliaro] busted his tail off to get back in and he's got another month, you know, to get ready,” said the head coach in reference to the upcoming NCAA tournament in March.
Weiss added, “He's one of the best, he really is. He definitely wasn't 100% this past weekend, but he will be – he will be for sure.”
Following Conigliaro’s victory at 174 lbs, the Crimson dropped two matches, leaving the dual in the hands of Harvard’s heavyweight senior Yaraslau Slavikouski at 285 lbs. Ranked at No. 9, Slavikouski had already made an impressive campaign this season, posting a 20-3 record and placing third at the Cliff Keen Classic back in December.
“At the end of the day, it is just another duel, just another competition for the team,” affirmed the senior captain, who hails from Belarus. “I think the mentality and the mindset, we always remain the same. We go out there to compete, to fight and win.”
His mentality certainly came through in a solid 4-1 victory over the Tiger’s senior wrestler Travis Stefanik. This victory marked Harvard wrestling’s first victory over Princeton in ten years. The former Ivy League and EIWA Rookie of the Year is locked in on bigger competition in March after missing the past two championship seasons due to the Covid-19 pandemic and injury.
When asked about his injury, Slavikouski said, “It provided me with the insights and gave me an appreciation of the time I have here – it just makes it that much better. Just getting the opportunity to step on the mat and compete for Harvard, represent the school, the team, and the coaches.”
After a loss to No. 25 Penn last Sunday, the Crimson moved to a 1-4 record for the season so far. Despite the previous losses, Coach Weiss is proud of his team and feels they are being prepared for the postseason.
“I personally like to put them in situations where it's going to be tough. I like tough competition because I think you're either going to rise to the occasion or not,” said Weiss, who will enter his 30th season as head coach for the wrestling program next year, which he has played a colossal role in reshaping over the years. “We wrestle that top competition that gets us ready early in the year because that's what we're gonna see at the end of the year.”
The Crimson will not wrestle this weekend but will return to the Malkin Athletic Center for two matches next weekend against Columbia and Hofstra as it looks to improve its record and sharpen its skills for the EIWA tournament in March.

Maybe you designed your own shopping week. Maybe you thought you really could handle six classes this semester. Or maybe you just can’t pick between those two classes (neither of which count towards your concentration, but hey, intellectual exploration is very integral to our liberal arts education — Dean Khurana’s words, not mine). Whatever the case may be, you’re now stuck spending one too many hours in class and not enough time doing homework for said class. Your roommates are saying it, your mom is saying it, and even you know it deep down: it’s time to drop that class. Not sure if you’re in that position yet? Read on to find out. Here are the five signs it’s time you lighten that schedule of yours.
1. You Have To Drag Yourself There
Is it your only class at the SEC? Is it at 9:45 a.m., meaning you have to be up at the ungodly hour of 9 a.m. to make it on time? Is it a reading heavy class but you hate doing any of the readings and will end up dreading the section? If you have to give yourself a pep talk every time you go to this class and it’s only the second week of the semester, it may be time to drop the class.
2. It’s Your Sixth Class 
Unless you’re a senior who has to take a sixth class for some unknown reason (potentially a last minute secondary declaration), don’t do this to yourself. Unless (maybe, just maybe) you take one of them pass-fail. The beginning of the semester may have been chill so far, but there is a long, treacherous battle up ahead filled with midterms, finals, and assignments. If you end up sticking with a sixth class, make sure it’s worth it. Otherwise drop it and focus on what you absolutely need to take this semester.
3. You Thought It Was A Requirement, But It’s Not
Electives are important. They’re your one chance to make yourself sound cool and interesting. You are no longer just a government concentrator with an economics secondary. You also just happen to be interested in folklore and mythology and would like to keep taking that gem super interesting class. All this until you realize you still have three Gen Eds to take and you’re a junior… maybe it’s time to drop this class.
4. It Requires Too Much Time That You Don’t Have
You actually don’t have to always take the most time-consuming classes, even if they seem to be in line with the academic rigor that you’re looking for. If the class is asking you for twenty hours of reading a week — even if you think you can handle it — remember that you need to account for your other classes too. Maybe fill out your GCal with all of the time you would need to spend on all of your classes. This way you’ll figure out if you should drop that class, or if it’s worth it.
5. You Just Don’t Vibe With It 
We don’t blame you. Sometimes, classes just suck. It may be your relationship with the professor, the teaching fellow, the content or your peers. Whatever the case may be, go with your gut! Your time at Havard is limited. Spend it doing what you really want to be doing. Don’t vibe with the course? Drop it. Unless, of course, you need it for your concentration, or your secondary, or your citation, or your joint… in that case, power through. We’ll always be manifesting an A for you.
BONUS: Your Ex-Situationship is in said course. 
Valentine’s Day is coming up soon — do you really want to be haunted by the reminders of your past? Are you strong enough to resist the temptation to reignite the flame? If you can be friends, friendly, or even just civil with your ex-situationship, we respect you and maybe you can stay in this course. But if you’re feeling a little tempted, maybe you should drop it. It’s not worth it, we promise.
