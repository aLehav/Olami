“Spaceman” and “This Is Heaven,” the two singles Nick Jonas released on Feb. 26 in anticipation of his upcoming solo album, might differ greatly, but they have one common denominator: While by no means bad, neither exceeds expectations.
In an interview with Zane Lowe, Nick Jonas said that he wanted “Spaceman” to convey his isolation and separation from his wife Priyanka Chopra last year, and his inspiration shows. The lyrics are the song’s high point, touching on everything from the hopes and angst of the 2020 election (“They say it's a phase, it'll change if we vote / And I pray that it will, but I know that it won't”) to the pandemic (“And the numbers are high but we keep goin’ down / ’Cause we ain’t supposed to live with nobody around”). By voicing his frustrations, he enables listeners to identify as the eponymous figure, and the clever metaphor resonates. Both the audience and the spaceman are mentally exhausted, painfully aware that online interactions are no replacement for in-person contact (“And I'm talking to you / But it never feels like it comes through”), and trying to return to a “home,” whether a physical location or a pre-pandemic world (“I'm tryna get home”). While Jonas’ words might be simple, they perfectly capture the immediately relatable feelings of frustration, solitude, and longing for a return to normalcy. His novel take on the familiar feels like a breeze of fresh air.
Unfortunately, the quality of the lyrics does not go hand in hand with that of the music itself. Nick Jonas’s voice and self-confidence, vastly improved since his last solo album in 2016, almost disappear under endlessly repeating chords. A promising intro morphs into verses that manage to sound rushed and monotonous at the same time. The choruses are catchy, but feel out of place; their upbeat, lively rhythm irreconcilably clashes with the verses’ relatively somber cadence.
“Spaceman” is no “Space Oddity.” David Bowie turned the motif of an astronaut and the theme of loneliness into a timeless classic. Jonas’s single, despite the same promising premise and great sonic elements, delivers a disjointed mediocrity in which the lyrics compete with the music, and the music with itself.
“‘This Is Heaven’ … touches on that feeling of being reunited with that person,” Jonas said in an interview with SiriusXM. Despite his vague description, Jonas again succeeds at sharing his feelings in song. The chorus reinforces his faith in his lover: “If you told me that my faith was on your fingertips / Then I wouldn’t believe it … / Now I’m a believer.” In the second verse, Jonas describes the woman he loves as the “center of my attention,” close to perfection. Just meeting her for him is the titular heaven. The lyrics’ emotion seems almost satirical in its exaggerated expression but remains innately understandable, especially in light of the separation described in Spaceman.
The song, dealing with love instead of negativity, invites its audience to cherish the small moments in life, even thematically nodding toward what soon becomes apparent. In comparison with “Spaceman,” “This is Heaven” does seem heavenly and, here, the music stands out. Admittedly, there’s nothing revolutionary about the single, which bombards listeners with the repetitiveness of so many radio hits now relegated to clubs. But does there have to be? Jonas’ song is as much as one might expect from him: a solid, easily-flowing piece of music whose smooth sounds would make for a perfect party dance tune. The liberal use of synthesizers and saxophone might seem out of place, but “This Is Heaven” succeeds in at least one place where Spaceman failed. It blends unexpected elements together and avoids disunity to deliver an overall pleasant, though not groundbreaking, tune.
As their final verses get more and more muffled before vanishing completely, both songs leave lingering questions about life, emotions, and the world. One thing becomes clear, though: If the two singles are anything to judge the upcoming album by, it won’t be a deviation from Nick Jonas’ standard repertoire.

If you can imagine a Malcolm X speech with the energy of Soul Bossa Nova, you can imagine “Rainforest.” A stunning hit by Twitter’s favorite scholar, Noname's “Rainforest” is a powerful exercise in dichotomy: The artist perfectly weaves together her signature bubblegum trap musicality, soft delivery, and cutting lyrics to develop an intimately complex and exciting piece of art.
If you were to take out Noname’s words and guess the context of this song, you would maybe place it in the soundtrack of an inspirational movie about a double dutch team or the theme song for one of Disney’s slightly more diverse originals. If you were to look at the lyrics in isolation, you would think you stumbled on some lesser-known spoken word pieces from Bernie Sanders in the ‘60s. You would not expect these two to mesh. But rap as a genre has a long history of hiding painful, dramatic, and political lyrics in an otherwise upbeat song — and Noname is a master of this form.
Her debut mixtape, “Telefone” was full of this. In “All I Need,” Noname raps about drugs and alcohol over a beat that sounds like it came from “Steven Universe.” “Casket Pretty” — a song about gun violence and police brutality — is underscored by a dub of a baby laughing. Noname took her lyrics to a new level of seriousness in her freshman album, “Room 25.” In it, Noname more boldly tackled the topics of her previous work but also attempted to match the topics with the sound, allowing minor chords and melancholic synth. In doing so, Noname also lost the playful energy the world had fallen in love with on “Telefone,” and the work was weaker because of it.
With “Rainforest,” Noname has found the best of both worlds. This is her most overtly political work, yet she maintains that distinct playground energy she developed in her mixtape. This may be because the Noname of today has so much more history to explore than the Noname of her past work. Since “Telefone,” Noname has become visibly socialist, started a national book club for reading radical Black texts, fought with the Beyhive for comments about Beyonce and Jay-z’s capitalism, and refused to perform for primarily white audiences. When J. Cole tried to tone police her, she called him illiterate in response on “Song 33” (although she would later express regret for the diss track).
“Rainforest” embraces this history. Lyrics like, “How you make excuses for billionaires, you broke on the bus?” echo her prominent and public critiques of billionaire defenders. The song features lines referencing the “Wretched of the Earth” — a radical anti-colonial text from the ‘60s written by Frantz Fanon — lines critiquing American imperialism, and lines about ecological injustice and international anti-Blackness. This is built on an upbeat loosely Ska and Samba-influenced, jazz-rap musical foundation. “Rainforest” is simultaneously a song to smoke with your friends to, a song to slow dance to, and a song to theorize to. In a very Illuminati-reverse-the-track type fashion, Noname invites the listener to take what they want from the piece, while she passes on her subliminal messages of radicalization.
Noname is the most prominent leftist in the rap game. Since rap is the most influential genre worldwide, by the transitive property, Noname is the most influential political thinker in the entire world. This might be a stretch, but Noname and her politics, her socialism, and her radical pro-Blackness are on display like never before, and Noname is not shying from the light. She has done her readings, and just by listening, the audience has too.

Color-splattered scenes of a crowd dancing; a groom adorned with a turban; a bride clad in deep red and heavy jewelry. The global conception of an Indian wedding is dreamy and extravagant — a lavish escape from the everyday. This is a romanticized notion, whose grandeur lends itself to the stage and is therefore often the subject of television and film. It’s a striking image, but a hollow one, too. Netflix’s new miniseries, “The Big Day”, depicts six couples of Indian descent as they plan and execute their weddings. Instead of offering a nuanced view of the difficulties and variations in the couples’ planning processes, it plays right into this stereotypical ideal; indeed, that is its downfall.
As Condé Nast India’s first show for Netflix, “The Big Day” wants for nothing in aesthetic: The color-laden scenery, artistic camera angles, and sentimental score are dazzling (the amalgamation of indie music and classic Bollywood show tunes strewn throughout the show catches the ear and is clearly well-curated). The general aesthetic and execution of the show are undeniably beautiful, but it is the underlying material that unveils problems beneath the superficial surface.
“The Big Day” had an opportunity to tackle the topics of criticism garnered by “Indian Matchmaking,” which debuted on Netflix last year to the chagrin of many Indian/Indian-diasporic viewers. But it chose not to. Or perhaps it tried to, and just fell short: notable, in this case, is the inclusion of a gay couple’s love story. This is a nuance that has a much stronger impact when looked at from an Indian perspective than from a Western one, as BGLTQ issues in India are still quite precarious. In fact, despite a landmark 2018 case that decriminalized gay sex, India has yet to legalize same-sex marriage. BGLTQ Indians have been fighting for the constitutional right to be married for a long time. The government, especially in recent years, does not seem ready to take such a “progressive” step; indeed, one of Prime Minister Modi’s top lawyers has been vocally opposed to the legalization of same-sex marriage. So, the representation of a gay couple broadcast in their full splendor on television carries a lot of emotional meaning for an Indian audience.

Still, “The Big Day” leaves too many other marginalized groups behind. Where is the representation for Dalit Indians, who have been and continue to be weighed down under the heavy hand of caste? Where is the representation for dark skin Indians? For poor Indians? Class and caste are violent societal factors, the effects of which run rampant in India’s streets, but too often they are swept under the rug, especially in mainstream media. All of the couples in “The Big Day” are light skinned — just like the soundtrack, the cast seems to have been eerily curated, clumped on the white-adjacent end of the skin color spectrum. So much so that, when a caterer or construction worker or random citizen is shown in a fleeting shot, their dark(er) skin is almost surprising. But the truth is that India looks more like the workers depicted in the show than the brides and grooms — so why relegate our rich blend of skin tone to the background?
The answer lies in India’s long standing problems with colorism and classism. Indian and Indian-diasporic people have been speaking out against the erasure of dark skin Indians for a long time, but the silver screen is just not ready to pay heed.
Additionally the excessive partying depicted in the show borders on absurd; it calls to mind some relevant discourse that arose about “Crazy Rich Asians.” Similarly to that film, “The Big Day” often glorifies capitalism in a culture composed of working class and impoverished people.
The show also seems to hide under a guise of being “fake woke.” Multiple brides are shown centering themselves as the main planner of their wedding. One discusses how she chose not to do Mehndi (a traditional female-focused ritual), another to not be given away by her parents. But rather than coming off as progressive, this behavior reads like uninformed disdain for tradition, inconsequential progress, and inconsiderate treatment of family. One bride shuts down a dance her siblings had carefully put together with a simple wave of her hand. Another writes a poem from her parents’ perspective (to herself), distrusting them to be capable of doing so, and displays it in her wedding program. In this way, what tries to be feminist and “woke” instead reeks of inauthenticity and haughty self-absorption.
“The Big Day”’s fumble illustrates that representation means more than matching skin-color or cultural background. The show boils down to showcasing excessive indulgence that, in truth, only a handful of super-rich Indian families can afford. It had the platform and potential to make a transformative statement on uppercaste, lightskin, and wealthy privilege in India, but it turned away, becoming just another form of media that ignores and enables social injustice on the subcontinent.

Covid-19 has had an undeniable effect on the film industry. Movies that were filmed and produced pre-pandemic have struggled to figure out how to manage releases — whether to delay a major theatrical release or depend on streaming platforms alone. Logistics aside, these films face another barrier: The major societal changes brought on by the pandemic have altered the audience’s perception of pre-pandemic films. What was once relevant to our pre-pandemic world seems antiquated in the light of our new life, resulting in some new releases feeling almost dated. “I Care A Lot,” directed by J Blakeson, is one of these new releases.
The movie follows Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike), a grifter who tricks her way into becoming the state-appointed guardian of vulnerable elderly people, forcibly putting them in care homes in order to gain access to their finances. The movie’s main conflict arises when Marla attempts to pull her scam on a woman named Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest), who turns out to have connections with the mafia. What follows is a fast-paced thriller that never quite finds its footing.
Partially to blame is the timing of the film’s release. The movie, which went into production in the summer of 2019, feels very much of that moment — from Marla’s particularly clunky vape to the shots of her in spin class. However, the largest contributor to the film’s feeling of datedness is the character of Marla herself.
Pike, who is best known for starring in “Gone Girl,” seems to be in her comfort zone in this role, delivering yet another stunning performance as a determined woman who uses feminism to justify psychopathic deeds. Beyond evoking Amy Dunne from “Gone Girl,” Marla — with her calculated appearance, quips about female empowerment, and startling blue eyes — seems to draw inspiration from Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes is the disgraced founder of Theranos, a medical tech company that made and sold a largely fictional technology that claimed to revolutionize blood work. Holmes, who had formerly appeared on the cover of Forbes and Fortune 500, was the subject of widespread media attention in the first half of 2019, inspiring both a podcast and a documentary that followed the history of her scam.
“I Care A Lot” offers interesting commentary on women like Holmes, who, as a woman in tech, largely became successful using neoliberal feminism as her platform. Under the guise of female empowerment, she gained support for her scam. Echoing Holmes, many of Marla’s lines in “I Care A Lot” could easily have come from a TEDTalk about female leadership, or a feminist quotebook. She speaks about remaining determined, refusing to let men threaten her or get in her way, and working hard to achieve her dreams — all of which is used to justify her robbing vulnerable people. The movie thus sharply demonstrates how capitalism and greed co-opt and distort feminist ideology. However, by relying heavily on cultural references that, due to the pandemic, seem as though they come from a different world, the movie ends up feeling almost archaic without being old enough to be nostalgic.
Putting aside the pandemic’s effect on the resonance of the film, “I Care A Lot” is mostly compelling. While Pike is certainly the standout, the film features strong performances across the board. It is also quite visually engaging. With its highly saturated colors and harsh lighting, the movie looks almost ad-like; the images appear simultaneously cheery and greasy, which works quite well in a film whose main M.O. is to critique the inherent falseness of capitalism. Still, the movie suffers from a major tonal problem — “I Care A Lot” is dark and suspenseful but is also quite goofy, without ever being truly funny. The result is a thriller whose comedic elements mostly serve to lessen the story’s stakes. “I Care A Lot” has great potential, but the end result just misses the mark.

Wikipedia will tell you that a meme is “an idea, behavior, or style that becomes a fad and spreads by means of imitation” that “often carries a symbolic meaning.” This definition, while not wrong, is woefully incomplete. I’m starting this column with a discussion of what memes encapsulate, and why a large umbrella definition is necessary: Doing so allows us to think broadly about how they start, why they catch fire, and why they burn down to ashes almost as quickly — only to be resurrected, phoenix-like, by people on the Internet thinking fondly back to their favorite formats.
But wait: “Formats?” “Theme?” What’s a meme format? To answer that question, we need to start with what memes look like or what they manifest as. Primarily images, memes also once were videos for those who remember Nyan Cat, The Duck Song, or Charlie the Unicorn. But of course, as technology has progressed, they morphed from images — ranging from photographs, cartoons, or anime stills — to text-based tweets, Tumblr screenshots, Tiktoks, Instagram reels, or any other medium that could be widely distributed or copied for one’s specific needs and goals.
If we think about just image formats for a moment, we can then extrapolate the concept across mediums to think about the “symbolic meaning” that Wikipedia talks about. The image itself is merely a vehicle: They’re linked, of course, but the image is secondary to the readily-understandable idea that, crucially, is implicit. Refinery29 dug into the “Disaster Girl” meme, in which a young girl looks back at the camera with a look of apparent schadenfreude at the burning building behind her. The idea is that she’s deriving some glee from having (maybe?) burned it down. When you look at it, you understand the feeling exactly. So when someone superimposed “there was a spider, it’s gone now” on top of the photo, the implicit idea is that feeling of satisfied glee that most of us have experienced from killing a spider and not having to worry about it anymore.
Of course, the meme doesn’t say any of that — which is what makes it so brilliant. Neither the text nor the graphic behind it individually conveys the message, but their unity lets the viewer understand the situation perfectly. The most important part of this phenomenon is that in the act of making the (often funny) point, very little, if anything, is actually explicitly said. The text and graphic need each other, bridging the gap between our very human gravitation toward language and our love for anything else that we perceive as visual.
Though the dissemination of memes often occurs across rough generational lines — Millennials and Gen Z being far better versed in recognizing, sharing, and being amused by them — once someone understands (often with a boost) that an image is a meme, the joke becomes recognizable. (The humor also seems to be generational, but the great thing about memes is that they're inclusive. If you want to understand them, you can learn.)
I mostly focused on images for the purposes of this discussion, but the idea still stands for tweets or even videos. A format is set, and people fill in the blanks according to what they want to say — again, without saying it. “‘look at the moon’ gf ‘where’ bf” for example, belongs to the format of “___ gf ____ bf,” in which people parody some relationship dynamics that are common enough to be amusing and instantly recognizable.
This last point is the other key to memes: their recognizability. If you know a format, successive iterations of it become obvious and understandable, as they follow the same recursive pattern, with the same undertones applied to different situations.
Which is why, I would postulate, they’re art. It’s still difficult for many to think of such Internet-based phenomena as “art,” but, I ask — why not? They require quick thinking, wit, and creativity. They capture our anxieties, desires, sense of humor, and cultural moment.
And, of course, just as not all art speaks to everyone, memes are much the same. Two summers ago, I didn’t go on Twitter for three days, only to witness the tail end of the viral “feral hogs” meme. I still don’t know what it referred to or why it was funny — only that it wasn’t my favorite format. Certain memes are for certain tastes: I’m partial to Bernie, for example. Just like conventionally understood forms of art, nevertheless, meme creation necessitates out-of-the-box thinking and the ability to capture and project an idea outwards. It’s time to reevaluate the artistic thinking, definitions, and limitations around internet culture: Memes are art, and they’re here to stay.

Pop Smoke’s acting debut goes hard in the film “Boogie,” and the late rapper hits even harder with the soundtrack. His latest single “AP,” released Feb. 26, leads the lineup of Smoke’s records to be featured in the movie, including “Fashion”, “No Cap,” and “Welcome to the Party.” All-stars like Jacquees, Kamaal Williams, and Fivio Foreign collaborate on the original soundtrack, with Smoke headlining as the star who gives voice to the journey of playing basketball through adversity.
The essence of the song “AP” can perhaps be best summed up by the lyric video, which casts Smoke in a hostile light as the antagonist ball player Monk. Vindictive as the beat of the drill on the track, Smoke raps about being a killer who “bust a check in my Nikes,” as he runs the court against leading actor Taylor Takahashi, who plays Alfred “Boogie” Chin in “Boogie.”
Balling under the Brooklyn bridge, Monk and Boogie struggle shoulder to shoulder in the beginning of the video, setting the mood for the conflict to come from director Eddie Huang. Behind-the-scenes sneak peeks get the viewer involved with the filming process, as well as allowing them to see Smoke grow into his first-ever acting role.
Pop Smoke’s signature drill beat drops just after the producer tag plays “Ayy, turn it up in the headphones,” getting the listener hyped right from the start. His flow morphs from staying on beat in the chorus to a quick-paced spit fire verse as the lyrics “get to sprayin’.” The grotesque word play in the second verse hints at comedic relief with “pop, knock his head off,” and “I bet he’d make a movie.” Overall, “AP” as a song is not distinctive from those we’ve previously seen in Smoke’s discography. Its sound resembles hits like “Welcome to the Party” and “Invincible” from albums “Meet the Woo” and “Meet the Woo 2,” respectively. But that’s precisely what makes it so trendy during an era when the iconic Brooklyn drill sound continues to revolutionize the hip hop scene.
The song flows seamlessly behind the lyric video, narrating Smoke’s transition from rapper to actor.
Smoke sings “I make a call and it’s war,” and the camera pans to Monk’s team barreling Boogie’s on the court. “Two tone, icy” sounds as Monk slams a dunk in a still frame. Smoke raps about “shawty wanna act like a diva” as a clip of the love-interest Eleanor (played by leading actress Taylour Paige) flashes across the screen.
“Boogie” is a story of hardship, love, and coming of age — things not necessarily associated with Pop Smoke as an artist. But Smoke bridges that gap by way of “AP,” connecting with the narrative and immersing himself into his acting role through the music. So while it may sound like every other Pop Smoke song, the fact that “AP” can be superimposed into a movie and still be relatable in that context is impressive.
Pop Smoke is an established icon in many ways already, and his influence only continues to grow.

It’s disappointing to see what “RuPaul’s Drag Race” has become. Any “Drag Race” fan can remember Jasmine Masters’s iconic 2016 soundbite, “RuPaul’s Drag Race is fucked up drag,” but despite the iconic dryness with which she delivered her nuanced critique of the curated and unrepresentative drag that “Drag Race” presents, never had I truly felt the weight of what Jasmine Masters had to say — until now.
Last Friday, “Drag Race” audiences, devotees and occasional viewers alike, tuned in to watch “Snatch Game,” the quintessential challenge of “Drag Race” in which the queens impersonate celebrities while participating in a mock game show. This Snatch Game was one to remember — not only did we get memorable impersonations of Paris Hilton by Gottmik and Mary Queen of Scots by Rosé, but we got Symone’s impeccably hilarious rendition of Harriett Tubman.
Symone embodied the pro-Black, modern-day characterization of Tubman, developed by the Black Twitter community, weaving in pop culture references of Tubman like Nicki Minaj’s shout “TO FREEDOM.” Whether or not you believed Symone should have won from her performance, you cannot deny that her Harriett Tubman should have landed her a spot in the top three. However, credit was not given where credit was due.
Looking back on her previous looks on the Main Stage that similarly celebrated her Blackness— including high-fashion looks that highlight braids, beads, and durags — it only makes sense that our favorite pro-Black queen of the season would bring that pro-Black flair to the runway this week. But what I saw left me in awe. Symone walked down the runway with grace, dressed in a beautiful all-white dress with a matching white miter precariously balanced on her head — a polished look that definitely caught my eye — but as she turned around, she unveiled one of the most vocally political statements I’ve ever seen on “Drag Race.”
On the back of her miter read “Say Their Names” in blood-red ink with two bullet holes embellished on her back. She walked away with her hands up, saying in her confessional, “It’s not a moment, it is a movement. We need to continue to say their names… Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Brayla Stone, Trayvon Martin, Tony McDade, Nina Pop, Monika Diamond.”
But through my admiration for her still much-needed statement almost a year after George Floyd’s murder, I knew immediately that Symone would be punished for this outspoken display of resistance. Unfortunately, I was right.
Once the queens stood before the judges, I wasn’t surprised when Ru told Symone she was safe, but I was surprised when Ru looked her in the eyes and thanked her for “bringing such a powerful message to the runway,” before proceeding to send her backstage, leaving Denali, whose JVN was JV at best and whose diner-themed runway was described by Michelle Visage as “literally... a costume,” in the top three.
RuPaul veiled the show’s contempt for pro-Black Lives Matters discourse with her shallow compliment towards Symone, while giving her spot in the top to a queen that seemed to have given less thought to her look and to her performance. Symone gave an amazing performance, brought a fashionable look to the runway, and should have been standing with Gottmik and Rosé in the top, but she wasn’t — because she said the names that “Drag Race” did not want to hear.
Over the years, “Drag Race” has skyrocketed from being a low-budget, campy, queer mash-up of “Project Runway” and “America’s Next Top Model” into an Emmy-winning, prime-time show. Unsurprisingly, this acclaim drove the producers to make changes to fit the show into the every-day American television, desexualizing the challenges and removing the package-bearing Pit Crew (*wink wink*). Unfortunately, these changes came at the cost of the show’s political foundation.
What makes Symone’s snub even more frustrating is that “Drag Race,” and drag in general, is inherently political. The show always finds a way to bring up the liberation front of the queer community. The queens have participated in challenges where they bring politics into their acts. As they get dressed for the challenges, the queens talk about their survival and the work they put in to fight for others.
For some queens, the activism doesn’t stop there. Previous contestants such as “All Stars 2” winner Alaska, “Drag Race” Season Nine runner-up Peppermint, and Season Four Miss Congeniality Latrice Royale are outspoken political voices and activists. Drag has always been a space suitable for Symone’s statement. “Drag Race” should be the perfect place for someone to give that message, to say the names of Black people brutally murdered by the police because drag has always been about activism, but last week, it was not treated that way.
Symone received overwhelming praise for her performance, garnering tweets from The Human Rights Campaign, as well as tweets of frustration over her snub, @MajorPhilebrity saying, “I want a fucking congressional hearing into why Symone was safe tonight and not the winner,” and @chantel_heart saying, “WAIT A MINUTE??!!!! SYMONE IS SAFE?!!!!!! WTF YOU MEAN SHES "SAFE"!! #DragRace.”
Symone admitted she was playing a risky game, saying, “But if it makes people uncomfortable, then it at least starts a conversation, and I’ve done my job.”
I am so proud to see Symone stand up there and bring her voice so bravely to the mainstage, but the bravery stopped when the camera turned to the judge’s table. It’s a shame to see that “RuPaul’s Drag Race” has forgotten its roots, and it’s even more disappointing to see RuPaul not put her money where her mouth is and give Symone praise for her performance and for her “powerful message.” I congratulate Gottmik on her win and am not compelled to argue against her success, but I just hope that this episode can initiate more conversations about how even queer media fails to acknowledge the political and the personal work that Black people, especially Black queer people and Black women, put in to make change in this world.
I would have hoped that “Drag Race” would have embodied the essence of political uplift that drag possesses, but Jasmine Masters was right. “RuPaul’s Drag Race” doesn’t represent the drag performers like Symone, Jasmine Masters, and the queens at your local dingy bar practice. “Drag Race” has become entertainment divorced from its roots, a failed project of uplifting the voices of the oppressed. Television should not be the time we ignore the bodies on our streets. Rather, the political should be celebrated — for drag is political, and it always will be.

I started “Fleabag” at the beginning of quarantine last March, and, suddenly faced with very little to do, I binged it with a fervor. I laughed, smiled, and gasped my way through two seasons of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s brilliant portrayal of the show’s eponymous protagonist, a slightly unhinged, daringly witty, sometimes-narcissist. When I got to the end of the 12th and final episode of the show and Fleabag looked meaningfully into the camera one last time, I shut my laptop and burst into tears.
I want to talk about two stories of death.
The first one is fictional. It is the death of Fleabag’s best friend Boo (Jenny Rainsford), who dies in a car accident (of sorts) before the events of the first episode. The death is accidental: Boo means to step in front of a bicycle and just break a bone in order to get the attention of her cheating boyfriend. Fleabag is there when Boo is fatally hit, and she is left with no one but her sister, a guinea pig, and the café that the two women started together, which she must now run by herself.
The second story is very real. It is the death of my friend whose passing I witnessed, in November 2019 while we were abroad together during our gap years, after he was struck by a car.
After my friend died, my entire world turned upside down. My sense of security, my sense of youth, of what was important — it all completely shifted. Even my brain didn’t work the same way. I was still the same person, but I acted differently. I was more sensitive, and meaner, and more empathetic, and sadder. Without much else to go on, I did what I have always done when need help processing an emotion or a situation: I turned to art.
Part of what makes resonant media about grief so important is that talking about death (especially a traumatic death like the one I witnessed) with someone who has not experienced a similar loss is incredibly awkward. In our culture, mentioning death is like saying Voldemort’s name: unspeakable for fear it might be summoned. Grief is also just hard to understand outside of itself. It is so absolute in its pain, so incredibly focused on an individual and one’s relationship to them, that relating to grief without having experienced this relationship is almost impossible. Most people whom I opened up to were incredibly supportive, but it was simply hard for them to know how to respond. What this means practically, at least in my experience, is that once the initial shock of the death has passed, and condolences have all been shared, people who are grieving are left with very few outlets to talk about their loss.
For me, this has been one of the most difficult parts of my extended grieving process. I encountered death in a close-up way at a young age. This experience is not unique to me, but it has been incredibly influential in how I see the world and interact with it. I want to be able to talk about my loss, but don’t always know how to, or even if doing so would be helpful to me. Moreover, I want to tell people about my friend, about his life, and how great he was — how they’ll never know how unlucky they are not to have met him. But it can feel awkward to bring up stories about him casually without feeling like I’ve invited the specter of death into a room. Art that speaks accurately to the feeling of grief can fill that hole, helping to parse through the torrent of emotions that come after a loss.
Unfortunately, and surprisingly for how universal the experience of grief is, most media about loss is not very good. In many of the movies, TV shows, and books I consumed that dealt with death, grief was framed as not much more than a dramatic plot point. Someone would die and the other characters would be sad for a while, until suddenly, magically, they weren’t anymore. They had traversed the five stages of grief and arrived at the promised land of acceptance, where everything was fine again. I felt awful after the accident, but the idea of “healing” felt horrible too. My friend was no longer alive, and one of the only things that I had to still connect us was my grief and the pain I felt at his loss.
Out of the works that managed to avoid this failure, many only dealt with the immediate aftermath of a loss (the disbelief, the funeral planning, etc). I certainly appreciated these depictions, but they weren’t exactly what I was looking for. What I was hoping to find as I picked up book after book, or scrolled through my Netflix queue, was some depiction of how I could move forward — not just immediately, but with my whole life. I wanted to know what I was supposed to do now that someone I loved was gone, now that I suddenly understood how easily anyone I loved could slip away in an instant. What do you do with that knowledge once you have it? How does it change you?
“Fleabag” is a depiction of a character whose every choice is grounded in the reality of life's limitless possibility for loss. During the first season of “Fleabag,” it isn’t clear how long ago Boo died. The accident was a short enough time ago that it’s still on everyone’s mind, but a long enough time has passed that people aren’t really talking about her. The dust has mostly settled, but it's clear the aftershocks of Boo’s death are everywhere. In that first season, Fleabag pushes people who love her away and brings people who can't love her close. It's the way someone acts who is scared to lose again, bracing herself for the impact.
I love the first season of “Fleabag.” There are so many scenes that remind me of my own grieving process — the awkwardness of other people bringing it up, the lashing out, the time spent disconnected from the immediate world, as is depicted so brilliantly in the show through the main character’s tendency of addressing the audience directly, literally breaking off from reality and entering her own mind.
It’s the second season, however, that really impacted me. Season Two takes place almost a year after the first. While Boo’s death is the driver of the plot in Season One, the second season is much more focused on a romance between Fleabag and a Catholic priest. However, it’s still a story about grief, just further down the line. Fleabag’s grief is no longer pulling her out of her normal life; it has seeped into it, informing how she lives.
There are lots of flashbacks in Season Two to Boo and her death, but also to the funeral of Fleabag’s mother, who died many years prior to the show from cancer. In one of those flashbacks, Fleabag is seen talking to Boo about her mother: “I don’t know what to do with it” she says. “With all the love I have for her. I don’t know where to put it now.”
The primary concern of Season Two is exactly that. Love, as espoused by the characters of the show, is a concrete thing that almost exists outside of two people, and can last after someone has gone. Fleabag’s main anxiety (and, quite frankly, mine) is this question: When you’ve lost someone, or if you know you are going to lose someone — as is the case in Fleabag and the priest’s doomed relationship — what do you do with all the feelings you have for them? Is love worth it if it is inseparable from grief? Yes, “Fleabag” responds, yes again and again.
“Love is awful,” the priest says at a wedding in the last episode of “Fleabag. “Love,” he continues, “isn't something weak people do.” The important thing, the show tells us, is to love, and to keep loving, no matter what. That’s how you hold onto someone after they’ve gone. “Fleabag” delivers this message in a way that doesn’t feel preachy or like it’s reading from a book of “best quotes about loss.” It just shows a story about love that keeps mattering after the person is gone. I can’t overstate how much seeing that for the first time on screen, almost six months after my friend had died, meant to me.
One of the most impactful scenes in “Fleabag” comes at the end of Season One when, desperate and crying in her café, Fleabag says to a man who is almost a stranger, “Either everyone feels like this a little bit, or they're just not talking about it, or I am completely fucking alone.” Loss is so much harder when you don’t talk about it. It is so much harder to go through alone. So to “Fleabag,” thank you. Thank you for talking about it, and for making me feel less alone.

In her newest studio album release, Julien Baker takes a bold step forward in her style while remaining true to her roots as a distinctive solo artist. Released on Feb. 26, “Little Oblivions” shows Baker carefully crafting a new sound for herself as she matures and develops into an even greater artist.
Diverging from the themes of spirituality, addiction, and loss found in Baker’s previous work, “Little Oblivions” dives into separation and longing. In songs like “Faith Healer,” the distinct tinge of Baker’s religious Christian music roots still shine through in her references to spirituality and faith. By taking this anchor of her history and using it to amplify a message of patience and understanding against the stigmatization of addiction and abuse, her music fuses the serious, the secular, and the spiritual in a profoundly enjoyable and empathetic way.
Throughout the album, Baker weaves honest tales of heartbreak that deal thoughtfully with addiction and substance abuse. Baker, who has been open about her experience of addiction, was able to use music as her personal form of catharsis. She beautifully molds these experiences into emotionally wrenching songs that are still easy to listen to and enjoy.
Baker’s songs are always deeply emotional and pull the listener in, inviting us to try to catch all the little details she painstakingly imparts in her music. In particular, the distinct sound of “Crying Wolf” stands out for its deeply intimate and touching dive into her past of addiction and the ensuing struggle of pulling one’s self out of those dark places. By preceding it with “Relative Fiction,” Baker creates a dichotomy between the two songs — the idea of needing to find solace even if only in one’s mind and the yearning for something real, but forgoing escape in the process. Together, the pairing smoothly creates a mood that captures the entirety of the album.
Throughout the album, and notably in “Bloodshot” where the album title is heard for the first time, Baker’s “Little Oblivions” are the moments we all yearn for, the fleeting escapes that, as Baker sings “take me and tear me apart.” Without being overstated or blatant, Baker draws on her past to guide others via beautiful music full of earnest messages. Even in the midst of a pandemic, and with a glimmer of hope now as vaccines roll out, people yearn for their own little oblivions in a number of ways. Some find peace in music as Baker has, and others at the bottom of a bottle. For both groups of people, there’s some genuine good in this album to help find a solution and a way forward.
In her own way, Baker marks her progress as an artist by moving away from her previous voice-guitar sound to a full backing band. Keyboard, banjo, synth, and more are noticeably featured on the album. Incredibly, all the instrumentals are performed by Julien Baker herself and cut into the clean, effortless sound on the album. It’s a clear break from the usual intimacy of her previous work, but it’s still enjoyable.
However, by diverging from the closeness and gentility of guitar paired with her intoxicating voice, the intimacy of Baker’s sound changes on this album. It feels as if — in terms of raw emotion — she has taken a step backwards. Baker had an incredible and powerful style, captured no better than in her song “Go Home,” from her 2015 album “Sprained Ankle.” Although it branches out in taking up the keyboard rather than guitar, there’s something “Little Oblivions” can’t quite express — whereas “Go Home” and the entirety of “Sprained Ankle” yank on the heartstrings and create an atmosphere that demands full attention of the listener’s heart and soul.
Of course, with every album, artists take steps in different directions as they grow and their listeners invariably change. But it seems as if by trying to embrace a more traditional band style, Baker lost that bit of the sonic intimacy that made her exceptional. “Little Oblivions” is still a great collection of music, but the sound has changed. An exception on the album is “Song in E,” which distinctly echoes her previous sound and is a welcome change from the rest of the album.
All in all, Julien Baker produced another incredible album. As she embraces and moves forward with the new band-like sound, it will hopefully into something as beautiful and intimate as “Sprained Ankle” with the added benefits of a more all-encompassing listening experience and the intimacy of Baker’s lived experiences paired with new instrumentation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an intimate conversation transcending the physical constraints of Zoom, Becca McCharen-Tran — founder of the fashion label Chromat — challenged audience members to think of fashion as more than just “looking cute and buying clothes at the mall.” On March 3, the Office for the Arts and other partner organizations welcomed the Harvard community to explore the intersection of fashion, architecture, identity, and social justice with McCharen-Tran. Moderated by QuInterns Annie A. Harrigan ’22 and Ellie M. Taylor ’22 from the Office for BGLTQ Student Life, the event featured interactive communication between the audience members and McCharen-Tran, with questions about her ground-breaking work making fashion more inclusive, social responsibilities of the fashion industry, advice to upcoming artists, and more.
The event is part of a series of in-person discussions hosted by the Office of Arts to introduce the diverse world of arts to the Harvard community. Although this event was conducted entirely over Zoom, the in-person, intimate conversational atmosphere was recreated when audience members logged on to hear remixes of Megan Thee Stallion from Chromat’s runway show playlist.
McCharen-Tran’s fashion label is dedicated to creating “future-forward bodywear,” especially inclusive swimwear for every type of body. Since Chromat’s founding in 2010, McCharen-Tran has been challenging the norms of fashion and what she calls “sample size models” by featuring models of all body types, genders, ages, and backgrounds — even when it was less popular to do so. Each piece of swimwear, from simple bikinis to complex, corset-like cage pieces, draws upon McCharen-Tran’s unique architecture background, all the while making a statement of inclusivity and empowerment for its wearers.
According to Raúl Cornier, one of the event organizers and Administrative Assistant at the Office for the Arts, Chromat’s message in the fashion world was what caught their eye. “Their message of inclusion, body acceptance, representation, and responsible manufacturing and sourcing are topics of interest to the Harvard community, be it students, staff, and faculty,” Raul said.
While other fashion labels tend to go for a unisex, block box t-shirt look when integrating gender inclusivity and neutrality in their designs, McCharen-Tran wanted to do more. She cited her 2019 Spring/Summer collection, in which she reclaimed wet t-shirts from the male gaze and awkward eighth grade pool party experiences for all body types by printing wet t-shirts directly on traditionally highly gendered swimwear. McCharen-Tran went on to explain that, at first, salespeople didn’t understand her runways celebrating all different body types and gender types. She wanted to create inclusive, diverse swimwear and to open up “the dream” to a wider audience.
Taylor said, “I was really excited and inspired by how Becca is actively working to ungender athletic wear. Her efforts to make swimwear that is affirming and celebratory of all bodies is pushing the fashion industry in a direction that gives me hope.”
According to McCharen-Tran, if Chromat’s mission in the past decade was showing that all different people are fashionable and deserve to be in high fashion spaces, the next chapter has become tackling systemic problems like worker’s rights and ethical production in the fashion industry. “Sustainability is also about how you treat your workers,” she said.
Asked about how the pandemic affected Chromat, McCharen-Tran described how she used this opportunity to try something different instead of a traditional runway show. She helped create a fashion film called “Joy Run,” which tells the stories of two transgender high school athletes who were banned from high school sports. The short film was part of a collection that was created to challenge “Olympics’ bullshit” definition of gender in athletics.
Some students were inspired by McCharen-Tran’s advice that there are no late bloomers in art. “I have always had love for fashion and was completely starstruck when I heard Becca answer my question,” said Erika Smith `23. “It was really inspiring to see someone in a field that I want to pursue in the future. Who knows? I think I'm going to finally start drawing.”
Asked about what he hoped that students took away from this conversation with McCharen-Tran, Cornier said, “That there is more to fashion as an industry and a field than pretty dresses, although there is nothing wrong with that too, but more as a way to express their personal style through this variety of people who are presenting similar messages and ideas that people respond to.” And for many people, Chromat is that very fashion label, embodying diversity and inclusivity.

“I think I always wanted to be telling stories in some way,” the Grammy-award winning musician Cécile Mclorin Salvant said to a Zoom room of wide-eyed Harvard students.
Music 188R, a creative music class taught by Yosvany Terry and Vijay Iyer, welcomed Salvant to Harvard on Feb. 23 as part of the Spring 2021 Jazz Conversations series. Entitled ‘Composer-Performers of the African Diaspora’, the course was created “as an opportunity to expose students to the contributions” of modern Black musicians so they could “learn about music in a historical and social context,” said Dr. Terry.
Miss Salvant’s energy is inimitable. Her musical aesthetic defies categorization, influenced and directed by the cultures of America, Haiti, and France. However, during the event she opened up about “the guilt of the diaspora,” sharing that a younger version of herself often felt like a “stranger in [her] own home.” This insecurity (and her willingness to talk about it) was compelling to and appreciated by students.
For Devon N. Gates ’23, getting to hear about how Salvant thinks about her “positionality as a Black female artist” was emotionally engaging; she added that she was impressed by the way Salvant confronted difficult issues in “spaces that normally don’t have these discussions.”
Gates singles out a real problem: Jazz is historically male-dominated and systematically neglects the voices of women music-makers. But Salvant has centered these women — her musical ancestors — in her artistry. “She’s pushing for an understanding of a history that has been invisible for many years; she is remarkably sensitive to that, and that’s what makes a difference,” said Dr. Terry.
Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Nina Simone, the list goes on and on: Dr. Terry acknowledged the rich presence of Black women in jazz historically and currently. “The line of singers [Salvant’s] connected to were all activists,” Dr. Terry said. “Their commitment to using the role of jazz as an American template for democracy has been incredible, and she’s very conscious of that.”
Miss Salvant’s commitment to raising up women of color in jazz, past and present — including herself — shone throughout the event. Miela M. Foster ‘21 said, “It’s hard to see authenticity sometimes in guest speakers and lecturers, so this was a very refreshing change.” Miss Salvant even moved her camera around her rooms, allowing students into her creative space. A painting that hung over her piano was passionately explained to be her main influence for ‘Ogresse.’ This led her to a discussion of Afro-Caribbean cosmogony and vodou, which have been influential in both her personal and musical development.
Foster commented that “[Salvant] really takes her art from everywhere, and it was so cool to hear where she draws inspiration from for her music.” Miss Salvant said she’s “constantly looking for surprise” in her work, which perhaps accounts for the ever-growing mosaic of her artistry.
“What would have been the course I always wanted to take but was never offered?” This was the guiding question for Dr. Terry as he worked with Dr. Iyer to design the framework of Music 188R, which is the culmination of years-long ideation. He said the idea of a Composer-Performer is “normal for everyone in jazz,” but often misconstrued outside of the jazz sphere as disconnected.
Students in Music 188R study the work of six modern Black Composer-Performers: Henry Threadgill, Cécile Mclorin Salvant, Esperanza Spalding, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Nicole Mitchell, and Tyshawn Sorey. The brilliance threaded through this lineup is real; Dr. Terry explained that they are all working with “improvised music in completely different scenes” and developing a “sonic universe” likely unfamiliar to most students.
Foster said she was especially drawn to this class because of the African and African-diasporic musicians centered in the syllabus — unfortunately a rare occurrence in academia — which has led to her having many “internal conversations with myself about identity.” As a spring semester senior, she called Music 188R “a last chance class,” expressing that it has been an exploratory and enriching experience for her.
Another positive outcome of the event: Gates recounted how she had emailed Professor Iyer to see if he could ask Miss Salvant for sheet music for “Somehow I Never Could Believe,” an aria from Kurt Weil’s “Street Scene,” which Salvant rearranged and recorded on her 2017 album “Dreams and Daggers.” He agreed, and Miss Salvant did, too: She sent over sheet music for her original arrangement of the song. Gates expressed her “crazy” gratitude for both Professor Iyer and Miss Salvant’s kindness: “I would have had to transcribe the whole ten minute song; now I have the sheet music the way she intended for it to be played.”
“First and foremost, I’m someone who consumes art, who loves art.” This statement, honest and passionate, cements Miss Salvant’s identity as raconteur. That was the goal of hosting this event, according to Dr. Terry: “By creating spaces where a master musician can be vulnerable with students…we hope to foster the sense of engagement and community that music can bring.”

Thirteen years after the “Avatar: The Last Airbender” series finale premiered, and six years after the series finale of its sequel, “The Legend of Korra,” it looks like the franchise may not be finished after all. On Feb. 24, Nickelodeon announced the creation of Avatar Studios, a production company which will make new content set in the world of “Avatar: The Last Airbender.”
Even more exciting, original “Avatar” creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko will be on board as co-chief creative officers. In a statement on Instagram, both creators expressed that they were “exceedingly grateful” and “excited to be back at Nickelodeon where Avatar began,” looking forward to returning to the fantasy world they helmed so many years ago.
This announcement, while seemingly out of the blue, can likely be credited to the show’s resurgence in popularity over quarantine. While the show has previously aired in reruns on Nickelodeon as well as on Amazon Prime, “Avatar: The Last Airbender” was released on Netflix in May 2020 and soared to the number one most popular offering on the site within the week. Since then, it has spent a record-breaking 61 consecutive days on Netflix’s top 10 list. Similarly, “The Legend of Korra” also reached number one when it was added to the streaming site in August 2020.
In addition to reigniting interest in the series, paving the way for Avatar Studios to even happen, Netflix may have contributed to this announcement in other ways. In 2018, Netflix announced a live action “Avatar: The Last Airbender” series was in the works. After the critical flop that was the 2010 live action “The Last Airbender” — which received a dismal 5% on Rotten Tomatoes — fans were skeptical, but the involvement of DiMartino and Konietzko was widely taken as a good sign. However, last August, both creators announced they were leaving the project, citing creative difficulties. In a later statement, DiMartino even wrote that “whatever ends up on-screen, it will not be what Bryan and I intended to make.” After this announcement, fan interest in the project waned; the announcement of Avatar Studios has now eclipsed news of the upcoming live action adaptation, effectively killing any lingering interest in Netflix’s project.
However, this announcement does raise some concerns. During the production and airing of the last “Avatar” property, “Legend of Korra,” Nickelodeon made confusing decisions: Last minute schedule changes and a mid-series switch from airing on cable and exclusively online acted as barriers to fans who just wanted to watch this fantastic cartoon. Similarly, from the onset, Nickelodeon was reported to have interfered with production, allegedly disliking that protagonist Korra was a girl and later requiring that the romantic relationship between two lead female characters only be strongly implied, rather than directly shown. While Nickelodeon is where the Avatar universe began, it may not have always supported the properties or the creators’ vision. Hopefully, the popularity of “Legend of Korra” despite production issues, and the continued smash success of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” more than a decade later will give the creators more leeway and control this time around.
Another cause for concern is whether Avatar Studios will play into the current reboot craze that has been shaping new releases. The practice of releasing stale, unoriginal remakes to capitalize on nostalgia is best epitomized by Disney’s seemingly unending parade of live action remakes. While it is a good sign that the Avatar Studios announcements emphasize the upcoming release of new content, the timing is suspect. There was a four year gap between the end of “The Last Airbender” and the beginning of “Legend of Korra” while the creators carefully planned the sequel. It was intentional, and DiMartino and Konietzko have since been clear about not returning to the franchise until they had a story to tell. Yet there appears to be a direct correlation between the series’ sudden increase in popularity last year and the recent announcement. Similarly, part of the critical acclaim of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” as a whole series is how satisfyingly all of the subplots and character arcs are tied up in interesting and compelling ways. Considering how final the show’s finale was, it is difficult to determine what loose ends remain to prompt a whole new movie or series. The search for Zuko’s mother (covered in the comics) and the founding of Republic City to bridge Aang’s series with “Legend of Korra” would seem to be the primary candidates, though Avatar Studios has yet to release more specific information about any projects in the works. While a surplus of derivative content is not desirable, the “Avatar” franchise has yet to disappoint in this way: From the two animated series to nearly a decade of comics, Avatar’s creatives have always made and distributed each addition with care.
Regardless of the quality of any new “Avatar” content, the original series will remain considered by many to be one of the best cartoons of all time. And in the end, the promise of more stories about Aang and his friends is certainly anything but bad news.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Why do people care so much about the ads?” my roommates — a handful of international students from the United Kingdom, among other places — asked me a few Sundays ago.
“Is the pitch the same size in rugby?”
“This is where ‘left shark’ happened, isn’t it?”
“How can that 43-year-old man throwing the football be so beautiful?”
Okay, that last one actually came from me. But as my apartment’s resident American football fan, I fielded no shortage of questions during Super Bowl LV. My tea-drinking, Queen Elizabeth-fearing roommates were quite puzzled by the game that unfolded that evening — American football is chess, not checkers, and it requires far more discipline and savvy than Tom Brady’s alleged victory celebration would suggest. Yet my roommates’ questions reflect their understanding of two critical truths about America’s most-watched sporting event: it’s a big deal in the ole’ U.S. of A., and it transcends mere football.
No, you haven’t stumbled into the Sports section of the Crimson — stick with me for a second. If not just the matchup between the National Football League’s two best teams, what is the Super Bowl? Is it the epitome of American consumption and ugliness — an annual excuse to binge an inappropriate amount of nachos with belligerent relatives touting beer-stained jerseys? Does it stand for something even worse when we willingly tune into a league plagued by issues of systematic racism and, more recently, negligence towards the current pandemic?
Answering these questions is far beyond the paygrade of a football hobbyist, let alone a deeply misguided Denver Broncos fan (sorry for the reference, Crimson Arts readers — please just trust that anything and everything I say about football and football culture is true). But I was offered a unique opportunity to view the Super Bowl through the eyes of international friends — newcomers who could recognize it as distinctly American yet struggled to define it. From their perspective, it wasn’t a single, concrete work of art or display to be judged. It was something more encompassing, more varied, more nebulous — like a living museum. And like any other museum, this one houses an abundance of stories across different wings. With so much to see, it invites visitors to simply wander around.
The first wing is dedicated to the game of football itself. Visitors hoping for pure action need not look beyond the surface: The Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are outstanding football teams. Talent abounded between the two rosters, and even my rugby-loving companions could appreciate the artistry of a perfect tackle or a twenty mile-per-hour run. Yet, just as there is more to a Van Gogh than pretty swirls, there is more to football than sheer athletic effort.
Although no one lost an ear during the course of the game, the mythology of football’s high-profile teams and players is as fascinating as the game itself. Kansas City and Tampa Bay proved that small market teams can make big splashes. The Chiefs’ young but decorated quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, won them last year’s trophy and might be the face of the league’s next dynasty. But Mahomes couldn’t stop Gisele Bündchen’s husband, who happened to win his record seventh Super Bowl in his first year with a new team at 43 years of age. Art is nothing without art history; beneath the universal sporting language of making flashy plays, there lies a rich web of narratives surrounding this game.
As we continue wandering, we might leave the realm of sports and stumble into the most expensive exhibition space in all of television: the hall of Super Bowl commercial slots. Ads on TV are often annoying interruptions, but for half of Americans, they’re Super Bowl Sunday’s main event. As a result of the unparalleled exposure brands receive during the most popular American broadcast every year, the game’s commercial slots have become a hatchery for some of the most memorable commercials ever seen — for better or for worse. This year’s slate featured a plea for pandemic unity from Jeep and a surreal five-second cameo from Reddit, but how could we forget all-time greats like Old Spice’s “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” and Snickers’ Willem-Dafoe-turned-Marilyn-Monroe edition of “You’re Not You When You’re Hungry”? Parallel to the football competition runs a championship in marketing — one that paints a unique portrait of today’s TV watchers and their interests (deodorant and Willem Dafoe, naturally).
But museums can be composed of physical experiences, too. Perhaps we leave this wing hungry and amble over to the food court, where a plethora of Super Bowl snacks awaits us. From traditional family feasts to Pinterest-worthy treats, there exists an entire culinary field dedicated to the social event that is game-day grub. One Google search reveals hundreds upon hundreds of recipe ideas for shareable dishes with a distinctly American flare. That is to say, these recipes leave something to be desired from a health perspective. It’s a near-holiday in the states, after all — indulgence and communal dining is to be expected. So far, this is an America my roommates can get behind: we’ve got sports! Snacks! Raging consumerism!
After a quick bite (or a meal, if we took the time to discover all seven layers of that famous dip), we might decide to walk off our nutritional regrets and stroll to the next wing. Here, we find another cultural phenomenon with a legacy as rich as the Super Bowl itself. What do Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Jackson, and Christina Aguilera have in common? They all played quarterback for the Denver Broncos. Just kidding, Crimson Arts readers. They’ve all represented America’s prevailing musical tastes at one of the most prestigious annual concerts: the Super Bowl halftime show. Home to massive set pieces and stunning visuals, the halftime show is a chance to make history — be it as a comically off-beat background dancer, a victim of a Justin Timberlake-induced wardrobe malfunction, or as trailblazers of representation in the entertainment industry. Even my roommates understood how strange, yet monumental, The Weeknd’s pandemic performance was. As great art reflects the state of life around it, so did The Weeknd’s show: the singer largely performed for the cameras, spending little time on a stage that would be surrounded by fans under normal circumstances.
The narrative of the halftime show is even more profound, however. There’s a reason Rihanna, Jay-Z, and other gigantic names in the entertainment industry have turned down this illustrious venue in the past, and much of it surrounds the league’s longstanding issues around racism. Former quarterback Colin Kaepernick sued the NFL for allegedly colluding to lock him out of the league after the rising star protested police brutality during the national anthem just a few years ago, and many have opted to boycott the league in solidarity. As similar treatment of other activists, allegations of discriminatory testing for healthcare payouts, and the marked lack of diversity in the league’s management positions suggest, the NFL has more than its fair share of catching up to do when it comes to advancing equity and inclusivity. The halftime wing of our museum consists of more than just a few minutes of serenade; it’s an arena where matters of justice beyond the field come to play.
Discussions of social issues and the Weeknd’s lonely production point us in the direction of an adjacent wing with a rather unsavory surprise — a grisly reality check in the form of a pop up gallery. Raymond James Stadium hosted nearly 25,000 fans this year. 25,000 fans. In one space. No amount of hand sanitizer dispenser installations can make up for an attendance number that so blatantly rejects all guidance on gatherings from the past year. Praising healthcare workers at the opening ceremonies only comes across as tone deaf when players and sideline officials let masks dangle haphazardly over their chins and the threat of a super-spreader event looms overhead. In the same way commercial breaks and halftime embody American cultural interests, American arrogance in the face of a lethal virus manifests in the coordination of this Super Bowl.
These last wings — no matter how disquieting — are very real parts of our museum, and it’s important to not look away; they demand our attention while we continue exploring. No story worth chronicling in a museum is without an ugly chapter of some kind, and what I gradually came to understand while getting grilled by my roommates was that a Sunday in spring can mean infinitely many things to different people. This game didn’t just foster a group dissection of American sports and celebrities, but of our handling of today’s most pressing social dilemmas, from the NFL’s involvement in the oppression and exploitations of Black Americans to sometimes-fatal pandemic individualism. Our conversation even extended to global attitudes towards these topics, covering far more ground than the mere rules of “less exciting rugby.”
Perhaps you didn’t particularly fancy a work you saw in one wing of our museum — football isn’t your thing, say — or maybe you were horrified by an entire display — in-person events at the height of a pandemic don’t resonate with you. That’s what makes the Super Bowl necessary viewing. As you peruse a museum’s various exhibitions, good and bad, you are forced to reflect in a powerful way — especially when accompanied by a first-timer, in whom even the self-proclaimed expert can find a learning companion. You learn about yourself, the community that constructed the museum, and the events that shape its collections every year. Museums of this size and grandeur don’t ask you to pass comprehensive, resounding judgement on everything you saw. They simply put artifacts on display and invite you to explore, offering windows into nuanced and at times contradictory facets of life.
Super Bowl LV may have been unabashed and concerningly American at times, but that’s why it’s important. Between sport, entertainment, and deeply meditative conversation on the country’s underlying social issues, there’s something important for everyone between our museum’s walls. The Super Bowl isn’t seeking cultural redemption — no museum needs to. All it asks is that we watch together, and hopefully learn something about who we are in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students generally care about conserving the environment, fighting climate change, and preventing human rights abuses. Yet, in the choice between sticking to our values and repping our clubs with socially and environmentally harmful fast fashion, we usually choose the latter.
Within the first week of arriving on campus, my closet was filled with boxy t-shirts from FOP, my freshman dorm, an IOP info session, and PBHA (which I’m not even involved with!).
T-shirts aren’t the only swag endlessly thrown at first-years to persuade them to join clubs. Stalls at the fall activities fair overflow with customized stress balls, water bottles, and stickers. This gear is mostly made from flimsy plastic requiring significant quantities of water and toxic chemicals to produce, which will likely be used once then end up in a landfill or as ocean microplastic.
Our misplaced motivations are fueling a fast-fashion crisis at Harvard. Fast fashion is a clothing production method focused on rapidly producing high volumes of cheap and low-quality clothing with a high environmental and social cost. To align our consumption choices with our values, students can replace fast-fashion advertising with meaningful experiences to attract new members. We may find that doing so will strengthen communities in addition to benefiting the environment.
Even the most vocal advocates among us fall prey to fast fashion. In preparation for a 2019 rally protesting the University’s investment in fossil fuels, Divest Harvard purchased hundreds of bright orange t-shirts. One of them now hangs in my closet — the color clashes nicely with my auburn hair.
While these cheap shirts seem innocent, they were made in Nicaragua, most likely under the inhumane working conditions that abound the garment industry. The half non-organic cotton and half polyester shirts require significant resources to produce: 2,700 liters of water, one-third pound of pesticides, and 2.1 kg of CO2 are needed to make a single cotton t-shirt. A polyester t-shirt is responsible for 5.5 kg of CO2. The microfibers that shed from synthetic materials like polyester contribute to 35 percent of the primary microplastics polluting the ocean.
There is no denying the sentimental value of college gear. We accept or purchase swag because it is a way to show school spirit and pride in the House and organizations we belong to (a subtle, more socially acceptable way to drop the H bomb is by wearing it). After college, gear reminds us of all the good times we’ve had. How else would I remember that I was a Matthews Meerkat and not a Mole Rat during my first year if not for my Harvard-supplied shirt?
While everyone is entitled to purchase items with sentimental value, Harvard has a problem with quantity and quality. By the end of college, students wind up with dozens of unflattering t-shirts that do little to grow their memory bank of experiences. Instead, these clothes clutter our closets and our minds until they are thrown out.
One potential solution to Harvard’s fast-fashion problem is to buy environmentally friendly and responsibly produced products. There are now a plethora of cheap clothing brands using responsible methods. The College can do its part by purchasing 100 percent organic cotton t-shirts for Orientation week and Housing Day. Organic cotton, while undoubtedly more expensive, uses 91 percent less water than non-organic cotton and is pesticide-free. The University can also set up year-round donation bins or recycling stations for torn clothes to limit waste.
Unfortunately, purchasing from responsible brands is not enough. Switching suppliers does not force us to reexamine our unsustainable practices and hollow devotion to overconsumption. In addition, I have yet to come across a company that can produce mass quantities of customizable t-shirts using socially and environmentally responsible practices at a price low enough to satisfy college organizations’ slim budgets.
Given the lack of sustainable, customizable, and cheap clothing manufacturers out there, the most reasonable alternative is to reduce consumption.
Elizabeth Segran, a senior writer for Fast Company, argues that companies should supplement single-use promotional products with meaningful experiences that ultimately form stronger interpersonal connections, while reducing waste.
Harvard student groups can do the same. Clubs can advertise to new students by setting up photo booths, hosting a baking event (vegan, of course), or finding other ways to leave passersby with positive experiences rather than another scrap of plastic. If board members insist on swag, take a field trip to one of Boston’s many thrift stores. You will lose some brand recognition, but you’ll gain lasting memories and consume less in the process.
We all need to make sacrifices to promote environmental and social justice. Trading crappy t-shirts and single-use chachkas for positive experiences and greater interpersonal connection is a price I am more than willing to pay. If you agree, it's time to wear your values and perhaps think twice before accepting the next piece of free plastic you are offered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was never very cool in high school.
Maybe “cool” isn’t the right word — I did have a social life (sort of). What I’m trying to say is that I never had a big group of friends. I’m quite intentional about who I choose to devote my time to, and it never seemed worth it for me to base a connection on something shallow.
Instead, I chose a few good friends that I’m still close with even after moving for school — our relationships were never built on foundations of convenience or proximity, so a few thousand miles didn’t change much.
Then I got to Harvard, where making friends — like everything else on campus — isn’t easy or natural. With Housing Day looming near, it has become a task grounded in strategy and approached with forethought — maybe even a little transactional.
Of course, it’s incredibly difficult to build friendships organically in a world where we can’t see each other smile in person or freely hang out without worrying about getting sick. Our offhand comments to “grab a meal sometime” are bound to be less sincere if solely for logistic purposes. Now, everything is planned.
But does that mean everything must also be calculated?
Blocking has been a complete nightmare, and I’m one of the lucky ones. Having spent the fall semester on campus, I was at least able to meet a few of my classmates. Still, there have been moments where I have felt not just lonely, but completely alone. I have felt unwanted and disliked. Unworthy.
Many of my peers aren’t at Harvard solely for academics. We’re here to rub elbows with future Nobel Laureates and be in breakout rooms with Junior Olympians. In short, we’re here for the “network” — whatever that means exactly. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that was part of the allure for me too when I enrolled.
So I think that when it came time to blocking, a lot of people hit the ground running. Conversations were premeditated weeks, if not months, in advance. Comfort and shared interests weren’t the only metrics used to assess potential blockmates — social implications were also taken into account. There was an element of cunning in a process that should have been grounded in nothing more than personal connection.
I’m still not sure if that’s a product of Covid-19 or just an aspect of life at Harvard I totally didn’t see coming.
Besides the question of who your blockmates are, there’s the added dimension of how many you can call your own. Do you have seven? If not, surely you must have five? Who are you linking with? God forbid you’re an international student taking classes at 3 a.m. and blocking alone — I’ve heard floating described as “social suicide.” Harvard could give Regina George a run for her money with as many people as I’ve seen get hurt in the past week.
Blocking is an outdated tradition that — while always being difficult for students — has especially failed to account for our present, very messed up world. I’m not sure it’s possible to form strong connections with seven people after one semester in regular times. The College is asking the freshman class to do that without having ever met in person.
I know all this and still found myself crying on a few occasions. Why have I been so torn up about it?
I’ve never been someone who felt the need to count my friends, or who was insecure about my ability to make them. I’m confident in the few but strong relationships I’ve built. More importantly, I’m excited to continue to meet the rest of my class over the next three years. But the blocking debacle made me feel as though the friends I made weren't good enough somehow.
Blocking has become this metric through which we judge ourselves and each other — how we measure the relationships we’ve had and those we’ve failed to build. And, somewhere down the line, we might have allowed it to convince us that we haven’t connected as deeply as we thought. Because, in our minds, could it really be possible that you’re close with someone if they don’t want to block with you?
Out of the fear that whatever (or however many) friends we’ve made aren’t enough, we’ve stopped waiting for things to happen naturally. We’ve allowed friendships to become about more than mutual trust and appreciation. We’ve done what competitive Harvard students do: we adapt.
I worry that in manipulating something so delicate as friendship, we run the risk of also soiling the very thing we seek.
So to my classmates: We cannot continue to approach every interaction with the expectation that we are getting something out of it for ourselves. We must not judge each other for not having enough — or any — blockmates. It doesn’t mean the time you’ve spent here hasn’t been meaningful.
Instead, let’s have the courage to be clear about where we stand with each other from the beginning. Let’s say what we think and be open about what we feel. More importantly, let’s just be friends and forget the rest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across their vastly disparate areas of interest, all Harvard students are taught and positioned to take pride in whatever field they seek to pursue. And whether they commit to the sprawling exploration of social studies, the molecule-laden realm of integrative biology, or (most commonly) the ever-popular field of economics, nearly every student leaves Harvard with a common token: a tailored, specific degree that offers subtle yet rich cues on what skills their concentration has imparted them with, and the pride associated with this distinction.
Except at the Harvard Extension School, that is. As it stands, students charting their professional paths at the Extension School are rewarded for their years of careful dedication with one of two meager degree titles, regardless of their specific field of study: Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies, or Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies.
To us, this makes little sense. Frustrated Harvard Extension School students have long recognized the gap between their academic efforts and output, and have been calling for an alteration to their degree name since 2016. Now, increasingly burdened and reinvigorated by a changing educational landscape, these calls have begun to louden, echo, and reverberate.
We wholeheartedly support these rising calls; as it stands, the Extension School’s vague degree labeling process lacks reason and rationale, trivializing the achievement implicit in years of specialized study at the Extension School. Indeed, at the Extension School, students of all backgrounds, ages, and levels of experience are able to spend years honing in on targeted areas of study within disciplines such as global studies, technology, education, and business and management. Ultimately, their degrees ought to reflect their mastery and celebrate the effort students expend to hone and refine their individual interests.
Instead, the degree-naming system stands as a troubling marker of unequal treatment, one that treats field-specific recognition as an exclusive courtesy, rather than as a basic, requisite, and hard-earned honor deserved by all students.
We understand the weight and importance of embedding the distinct names of Harvard’s schools within individual degrees. Whether it’s a Harvard College, Harvard Law School, or Harvard Extension School label, such specifications are indispensable. They capture the distinctiveness of academic life across the University’s different schools. But still, such school-based labels cannot stand alone. In isolation, what does “in Extension Studies'' mean? This description only tells one small piece of a much larger story — and, without deeper context, the work of Extension School students threatens to become markedly devalued, trivialized, and flagrantly misunderstood.
In fact, the Extension School’s inability to duly honor its students undercuts its most basic, fundamental mission. The Extension School was founded upon a commitment to enhance educational equity, to lower the barriers of entry to advanced education, and to open up the channels of knowledge imparted by global experts to a broader public. Extension School students — who come from diverse walks of life and often pursue other projects while studying at Harvard — enrich Harvard’s academic spaces with insight gained from their own work and life experience. But how can the Harvard Extension School truly optimize equity and honor such vibrant exchanges when its graduates are, at the most foundational level, denied even-handed levels of recognition and regard? At its core, the University’s delegitimization of Extension School life undermines its noble founding principles.
Right now, the richness of instruction non-traditional modes of learning can offer is becoming ever more recognized. Indeed, for years, many Extension School courses have been either partially or entirely online; now, after years of being unique in this regard, students at every Harvard institution — from the College to the Medical School — are taking virtual courses themselves. From nearly two semesters of virtual learning, we have learned what Extension School students have known for years: that a Harvard education is not defined by fancy lecture halls, but by the content of its teaching and the dedication of its students.
It is time for Harvard to recognize — and quite literally put a name to — the ever-enriching nature of the distinct, focused scholarship embedded within Extension School life. The University must live up to the Extension School’s equitable and dynamic ideals; it must offer all students the careful, well-earned forms of recognition that they deserve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 9, 2020 at 12:28 a.m.
Professor Cornel R. West ’74 announced his departure from Harvard and return to Union Theological Seminary in a Monday interview with the online publication The Boycott Times, weeks after West alleged Harvard denied his request to be considered for tenure.
“I am blessed to announce with my dear brother Mordecai Lyon of The Boycott Times that I am moving from Harvard to Union Theological Seminary in New York City! Our struggle for truth & justice continues with style & smiles!” West tweeted, linking to the interview.
West threatened to leave Harvard in late February after he said the University dismissed his request to be considered for tenure. In subsequent interviews with several media outlets, West said his request for tenure consideration was denied, in part, because administrators’ termed his work “too risky” and “too fraught.” Following his threatened departure, Harvard affiliates rallied behind West, launching several letters and petitions demanding his tenure.
Monday’s announcement marks the second time West — a Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy at the Harvard Divinity School and in the Department of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts of Sciences — will leave Harvard. He previously departed Harvard in 2002, following a dispute with then-University President Lawrence H. “Larry” Summers. He returned to the University in 2017.
West previously said in an interview with the Boston Globe that he felt “disrespected” by the University and would not “try to negotiate respect.”
“There are wonderful people at Harvard, we know that. It has a great tradition of Du Bois and so many others, but I discovered that I can only take so much hypocrisy,” West told the Boycott Times.
“Harvard has actually done very well in terms of bringing different peoples of different colors and gender at a high level into the administration,” West added. “But it does not yet translate on the ground in terms of faculty. It does not yet translate in terms of being able to speak to the seeking of truth amongst the students.”
He said in the Monday interview that there are “certain taboo issues” at Harvard, including the Israeli-Palestine conflict. West has been an outspoken critic of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and alleged last month that Harvard dismissed his tenure request in part due to his position on the issue.
West said that he was “going with a smile” to Union Theological Seminary — his “perennial home” — where he currently serves as Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Christian Practice. From 2012 to 2016, during his time away from Harvard, West taught at Union — where he also began his teaching career as assistant professor in 1977.
In a Monday press release, Union Theological Seminary President Serene Jones wrote she was “thrilled to welcome Dr. West back home to Union.”
“Dr. West lives and breathes the values that Union aims to instill in all of the future leaders, scholars, ministers, and activists we educate,” Jones wrote. “His esteemed legacy of engaging the most pressing problems facing our world — including racism, poverty, sexism, and so much more — is an inspiration to all, and illustrates the power of faith to create profound change.”
West will begin at Union Theological Seminary on July 1, 2021 as the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Chair, teaching courses such as Philosophy of Religion and African American Critical Thought.
Jones told the New York Times Monday that West’s new position is tenured and that, if she could, she would grant West “quadruple tenure.”
In a message to Divinity School students Monday afternoon, David N. Hempton, Dean of the Faculty of Divinity, and David F. Holland, acting Dean of HDS, wrote that they wanted to “express our sadness at the departure of our esteemed colleague.”
“Since coming to Harvard in 2017 as a jointly appointed Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy in HDS and FAS, he has made an enormous contribution to our curriculum and to our capacity to address issues of racial justice in the United States and around the world,” Hempton and Holland wrote.
“We had hoped to retain him on our faculty for many years to come,” they added. “We nonetheless wish him every success in his future endeavors.”
HDS and African and African American Studies Professor Jacob K. Olupona said he is deeply saddened by the departure of West, whom he described as “one of the leading lights in Black theology and philosophy.”
“I think there are just very few senior Black scholars in the Divinity School, very few,” Olupona added. “So for us to lose one of the very few, I think that’s a sad, sad thing.”
Olupona said he was surprised to hear of West’s decision, even though he had been aware of West’s initial threat to leave Harvard.
“He is irreplaceable,” Olupona said. “I was hoping against hope that the University will try to do something to keep him, to make him change his mind.”
“You don’t need anybody to tell any citizen of Harvard — whether it is a student or faculty who is familiar with him — what they’re losing,” Olupona added.
Late Monday night, undergraduate organizers who had previously launched a petition to urge Harvard to grant West tenure announced they planned to continue pushing the University to “retroactively consider Professor West for tenure.”
“We’re devastated by Professor West’s departure from Harvard, but our fight will not end here,” one of the organizers, Ajay V. Singh ’21, wrote in an emailed statement. “In a continued testament to our collective power and solidarity with Professor West, we would like to stage a demonstration in honor of his legacy at Harvard and escalate our approaches for change.”
Singh wrote that although West will depart from Harvard, students will continue to rally around issues of diversity and inclusion on Harvard’s campus, such as demanding the creation of an ethnic studies department and reform to the tenure process.
“Too often are calls for justice forgotten because an institution relied on the short memory of its advocates,” Singh wrote. “In that vein, we will continue to fight to support people of color on Harvard’s campus. We deserve and demand respect.”
In the Boycott Times interview, West — who was often seen at demonstrations with student organizers — struck an optimistic note about the ability of Harvard to change, saying that the “best of Harvard” lies with students and faculty who are “not well adjusted to injustice.”
“Harvard can change. I’m an extension of Harvard in terms of my education and I have to be honest about it,” West said. “And that’s why I’m making the move back to New York, and it’s not a move out of default.”
“I’m going fired up. And I’m going with my focus on oppressed people around the world,” he added.

Sondra R. P. Anton, a second-year student at Harvard Law School, has coordinated an open letter to the United Nations calling on the Human Rights Council to create a new resolution to promote accountability for human rights violations in Sri Lanka.
The open letter, which was sent in February, argues that “prospects for domestic justice and accountability efforts in Sri Lanka have dimmed entirely” since the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa to the Sri Lankan presidency in November 2019.
The letter was signed by 22 organizations, including Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic, the Center for Justice and Accountability, Human Rights Watch, and the World Organization Against Torture.
Rajapaksa formerly served as secretary to the ministry of defense in the government led by his brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, from 2005 to 2015. During this period, many critics of the Sri Lankan government disappeared or were tortured or murdered.
Sri Lanka's 26-year-long civil war ended in May 2009 with the deaths of tens of thousands of Tamil civilians in the final months alone, many of them caused by government shelling. The UN and other human rights groups have called for inquiries into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa during this period.
Rajapaksa’s election to the presidency has ignited fears about the regression of human rights in Sri Lanka. In February 2020, the new administration announced its withdrawal from a landmark resolution that promoted human rights — a move the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said demonstrated the Sri Lankan government’s “inability and unwillingness” to be held accountable for human rights violations.
Anton, who worked closely with the Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic during the letter-writing process, said this is “a really pivotal time” for Sri Lanka, and that the country is “one of the world’s biggest failures” in recent history.
“There’s this assumption that with the end of war comes peace, and that could not be further from the truth in Sri Lanka,” Anton said.
Tyler Giannini, a co-director of the Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic, said the letter “fits into a broader effort” to advocate for increased accountability in Sri Lanka, which has been perpetrating decades-long human rights abuses that culminated in the killing of tens of thousands of civilians in 2009.
“There’s really two reasons to do this letter,” Giannini said. “To make sure that accountability doesn’t go off the international agenda, and also to prevent future abuses, because there’s heightened risks of things deteriorating pretty badly in the future under this new regime.”
Thomas Becker, a signatory of the letter and a former clinician at the Law School, said he believes the growing wave of ethno-nationalism and persecution of minorities is influenced by a lack of accountability in places across the globe, including Sri Lanka.
“Impunity breeds impunity and justice breeds justice,” Becker said.
James L. Cavallaro ’84, the executive director of the University Network for Human Rights and former professor at the Law School, said it is “important that the UN re-engage” with efforts to hold Sri Lanka accountable.
“This is a space where a state like Sri Lanka is susceptible to international pressure, and it’s sort of fallen off the international radar screen,” Cavallaro said. “People have sort of moved on in a way that is not healthy, in a way that is not good for international law, for accountability.”
Nushin Sarkarati, senior staff attorney for the Center for Justice and Accountability, said it is “up to the member states now” to determine whether the world will hold Sri Lanka accountable.
“I hope they see that there is a groundswell of support for a new resolution,” Sarkarati said. “We want them to recognize that various NGOs are all supportive of this action moving forward and it's up to them to now vote in favor.”
Anton wrote in an emailed statement that, as the daughter of an Ashkenazi Jewish mother and a Tamil father, she has witnessed how “the legacy of mass atrocity is passed down through generations” and the “indelible mark that impunity leaves on survivor communities.”
“Witnessing the pain and reliving of trauma that international inaction has brought on my own family and community has made this type of work even more frustrating at times,” Anton wrote. “But it also serves as a constant reminder that regardless of what happens this month in Geneva, and no matter how much time has passed, justice matters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the negotiations over a second contract between Harvard and its graduate student union looming, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an interview Friday that he is “very optimistic” going into bargaining.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers has indicated that discriminiation and harassment protections, mental health, and access to specialist care will be among its priorities in negotiations. Disputes over healthcare and discrimination policies dominated negotiations over the union’s first contract, which resulted in the longest graduate student strike in recent history.
“There is a new team representing the union, and I am very optimistic that we will work together very effectively,” said Garber, who has taken a leading role in relations with HGSU-UAW because of its implications on academic life.
The union’s current contract — which took over a year to negotiate — will expire June 30.
Garber indicated some willingness to bargain over mental health initiatives with the union. A University-wide report issued in July estimated that 23.6 percent of surveyed graduate students exhibit symptoms of depression and 23.1 percent exhibit moderate to severe anxiety.
The report recommended the University launch a campaign to raise awareness and foster culture change around mental health issues. Garber said the University is planning to implement the report’s suggested approach.
“We are very much involved in efforts, generally, to improve health care for all of our students,” he said. “And we have, as you know, a major initiative to improve student mental health.”
“We are in the midst of working out how to fully implement that recommendation, and the others in the report,” Garber said of the awareness campaign.
In a statement on Monday, HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla indicated the union plans to push for policy changes beyond the awareness campaign.
“Public campaigns to raise awareness of the high incidence of mental health needs of student workers are important, but not enough,” Mancilla wrote. “Perhaps, faculty and administrators are not aware of our conditions, but we, student workers, know our own situation and needs extremely well.”
“We need policy change, not public campaigns,” he added.
Mancilla also wrote that graduate students have faced worsened mental health issues due to the coronavirus pandemic. He noted that economic uncertainty, a “bleak” job market, and family responsibilities increased the stress experienced by the students throughout the last year.
“It is unsurprising then that this toll on our collective and individual well-being has led student workers to demand more attention to health care resources, especially mental health, and the structures and culture that have created a taxing environment,” he wrote.
The union is also poised to negotiate over access to specialist care, which Mancilla stated has suffered during the pandemic.
“Student workers have seen their access to remote and out-of-state care worsened, for both routine and specialist care,” he said. “In some cases, student workers have faced wait times of over 2 weeks for initial mental health screening appointments.”
Asked if Harvard would be open to a “mental health bill of rights” — an idea the union has previously floated — Garber declined to get into specifics.
“Right now, we are focused on implementing the recommendations of the student mental health task force, and we are very open to ideas about how to improve our approach to student mental health,” Garber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Cambridge city councilors said they were frustrated with the delayed response from the city’s legal department regarding a total tear gas ban at a Monday meeting.
The Council discussed draft ordinance language surrounding the prohibition of tear gas use by the Cambridge Police Department. Though CPD has not used tear gas since 1972, its use is not explicitly banned.
Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. said at the meeting he is currently pursuing a tear gas ban via the implementation of an official department policy.
“We found some tear gas in our inventory and destroyed it,” Bard said. “We have no tear gas on hand, we don't authorize the use of it, and I have no problem with totally supporting a ban on using tear gas.”
At the meeting, ordinance sponsor Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler questioned the legal opinion issued by the City Solicitor’s office that obstructed the forward motion of the policy, which was passed by the council last November. According to Sobrinho-Wheeler, the opinion stated the council itself does not have the authority to ban the use of weapons in city departments.
“The law department had four months to research this, then initially decided to support it as recently as two weeks ago,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “I'm just trying to understand what happened in the last few days that led the legal department to come to a different conclusion.”
Many other councilors said they shared Sobrino-Wheeler’s grievance, which comes a week after Councilor Dennis J. Carlone similarly said he was dissatisfied by the legal department’s delay in reviewing two amendments regarding campaign finance regulations at an Ordinance Committee meeting.
City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa said she thought the councilors’ comments were “personalized,” and that the four months between November and early March were “not actually that long” compared to reviews of previous council orders. She also said she had met with Sobrino-Wheeler and was the “point-person” for the city council, and defended her role as a liaison between the council and the legal department.
“It does appear that there are times recently when things that the council wants to be done, that there is a sense of urgency,” Glowa said. “But if everything is urgent, then not everything can be done at the same time.”
The council also received its regular weekly update on the city’s Covid-19 pandemic response from Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob.
On March 8, the city began administering the one dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, with additional shipments expected in early April, according to Jacob. He added that the case positivity rate in the city has decreased to 0.39 percent, down from the last report given to the council on Feb. 20.
Last week, the city entered “Phase Three, Step Two” of the Cambridge phased reopening plan, which increased capacity limits across the city to 50 percent. Jacob, however, said that indoor dining at restaurants is one of the principal causes of Covid-19 transmission in Cambridge.
“With regard to indoor dining, what we'd like to see is the change in our dining out culture where the pandemic is under control,” Jacob said. “For people who want to dine indoors, the safest behavior would be to eat quickly without talking and wear a mask at all times.”
The council also adopted a policy order mandating the city to explore the creation of a mobile Covid-19 vaccine clinic. Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, who co-sponsored this policy order, cited the lower vaccination rates for residents of color compared to white residents as a reason for establishing these clinics.
“I have spent the last four to five weeks helping to get vaccine appointments and rides for residents who don't have cars, don't have computers, and it's incredibly painful,” she said. “We really need to be intentional about remedying this inequity and the vaccine distribution, and this is a way that could help.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed the future of female public leadership in a Monday Institute of Politics webinar, drawing the largest crowd in IOP forum history with more than 2,000 spectators in attendance.
IOP President Menatallah N. “Menat” Bahnasy ’22 and the co-chair of the alumni network Women in Defense, Diplomacy, and Development Aoibheann E. Thinnes moderated the event, held on International Women’s Day.
Albright opened the discussion by recounting her experiences as the “only woman in the room” while serving on the U.N. Security Council and as Secretary of State.
“One of the things that I had often talked about to my students was that as the only woman in the room, you had to decide that you were going to speak no matter what, and not wait around to figure out whether they liked you or not,” Albright said.
In making herself heard, however, Albright said she faced more resistance from American men that she knew personally than those from abroad, particularly when concerns were raised over her qualifications as nominee for Secretary of State.
“I actually had more problems with the men in our own government. And that is a very hard thing to say,” Albright said. “And I'm trying to explain it to myself in the following way, which is that they had known me for a very long time — I was a friend of their wives, and I was a carpool mother, then I was a staffer, and I made a lot of coffee and Xerox. And they thought, ‘How did she get to be Secretary of State when I should be Secretary of State?’”
While serving as Secretary of State, Albright said she learned the importance of practicing “soundbite diplomacy” to make diplomatic language more accessible to the general public.
“I think the thing that really did happen was that I felt that kind of long academic discourse didn’t explain well enough to the public what was going on,” Albright said. “I have learned to be able to be succinct and to try to come up with some kind of an image is important.”
When asked about the ornate pins that line her suit jackets, Albright said they are meant to make “foreign policy less foreign, frankly.”
Albright said these pins have become a quintessential aspect of her wardrobe, reflecting her assessment of her daily agenda items — pins of “flowers and butterflies and balloons” represent good days, while “carnivorous animals and spiders and things” signify bad days.
To conclude the discussion, Albright imparted her mantra for women to the event’s attendees.
“I really do think a mantra for a woman is to interrupt, because if you raise your hand, by the time they call on you, the point is not germane,” she said. “That’s my message to all of you. You’re getting a great education, and you are going to be incredibly well prepared to do whatever you want to if you interrupt.”

From its insane level of cleanliness (this writer saw not even one bug during her semester there) to its status as the most classic (read: beautiful) House, you know that your three years at Dunster will be filled with the sweetest community and the most wholesome events known to Harvard!
For a House that has the moose as its official mascot and is even shaped like a moose from an aerial view, one of Dunster’s best-kept secrets might shock most people as a betrayal — that’s right, the animal on Dunster’s crest is actually… an elk. Now that we’ve got that baggage out of the way, Dunster is the House with the most perks, so much so that I had to cut off HoCo chair Dylan Zhou ’22 after a few minutes during our interview because I had other questions to ask him.
“We have our own gym. We have our own grille where you can buy food late at night. We have one of the most beautiful dining halls out of all the Houses … we have a squash court, gyms to work out… music practice rooms, an art studio,” he said, just to share the ultra-condensed version with everyone lucky enough to become a Moose come March 12. Recently renovated, Dunster has not lost its old Harvard flair, with dark wood and chandelier lighting that will make you wonder why Annenberg was ever compared to Hogwarts when every single common space in Dunster is literally right there. I mean, the library has ladders and a fireplace, y’all. And, with a dining hall staff that keeps finding new ways to keep residents happy (this writer enjoyed macaroons courtesy of the staff), you might have a hard time ever willingly leaving Dunster on your own.
Dunster House has had a successful and wholesome transition to becoming a semi-online community. From trivia nights that enjoyed large turnouts to a paper moose that gets mailed around between students, the Dunster community was stronger than ever last semester. “We’re sending it through the mail, and when you get it in your location, you take a picture of it, and then you post it on our Slack Channel,” said HoCo chair Leslie Arroyo ’23 regarding their traveling moose.
“We have this weekly community night where people come to hang out… Last week, we did Valentine’s Day candy grams, and we passed out about 100 messages and candy bags and roses to people in the House. Going forward, we’re thinking of creating a virtual Dunster House on this platform called Gather.town,” Zhou said. As someone who attended an online social on Gather, let me tell you, this is the only kind of online social that is actually fun. And with their Deans returning to host biweekly community dinners, including one event that featured trying progressively hotter hot sauces, you will surely enter an extremely ~spicy~ community!
With so many perks, amenities, and the best community you could ask for, Dunster would still be the best House even if they made everyone sleep in bunk beds. Luckily, Dunster is as much about comfort as it is about class. As a sophomore, you're likely to live in a hallway double or a quad consisting of two doubles. Upperclassmen options are seemingly endless, with a wide variety of hallway singles, suites with multiple floors (!!), and The Penthouse (7 singles all together make quite the party space). No matter where you live, you will definitely enjoy the hardwood flooring and cleanliness that Dunster is known for.
Still want to learn more about Dunster? We’ve got you covered with all the hottest #moose #material from Arroyo and Zhou. 
If you had to describe Dunster in three words, which words would you choose?
DZ: Clean, because our facilities are just in very pristine shape. Rustic. Welcoming.
What is one of your favorite memories associated with Dunster?
LA: One of my favorite memories goes back to actual Housing Day. Unfortunately, for me — our Housing Day was virtual. I think we came in... a little bit disappointed about how that would work and whether we would feel included… I remember as soon as [the results] went out, and we found out it was Dunster, it was just crazy. We also saw one of our favorite seniors at the time… the star of the Housing Day video last year, and she was like “Oh, I’m so happy to have you guys in the House,” and it was just a great welcome, and we felt so included.
If Dunster didn’t have the moose, what would be its mascot?
DY: A swan, because it’s elegant like Dunster is!
If Dunster were a HUDS dish, what would it be?
DY: New England Clam Chowder, just because it’s classic and good all the time.
What is one thing that you would like freshmen to know about your House?
LA: I would like freshmen to know that it’s a great community, and I know that sounds a bit cliched, but I think the community really makes the House what it is. And even when we have virtual events, it’s just been such a nice community, and it really makes you feel at home.

Mather House features a tight-knit community with an infectious House spirit and an amazing residential staff, plus unparalleled river views. And, you know what they say about more singles... ;)
If it wasn’t already clear from their last Housing Day video, Mather has a contagious sense of House pride. When it comes to IM's, Mather is the place to be, having won the Straus Cup back-to-back (“Pfft, champions.”). The undeniable warmth and close-knit community of Mather extend beyond students and to the House administration and tutors. “On our sophomore orientation trip … the Mather Faculty Deans just sat next to me and started chatting and wanting to know who I was. I think that that’s a very common occurrence in Mather,” HoCo co-chair Michelle G. Kurilla ’22, a Crimson news comp director and design executive, said.
Mather maintains its strong community with a host of social events throughout the year. Mather HoCo holds bi-weekly Happy Hours (instead of steins) in the Big TV room, with food, strobe lights, and water pong. Every Sunday, you can get free cappuccinos and baked goods at Coffee Bar in the senior common room. Annual foam party Mather Lather and Fall Fest, an outdoor carnival-esque social held near Halloween, are among the House traditions. In the week leading up to Housing Day, House residents also partake in Mather Week, with events like Dogs & Donuts and other Mather-ish things like “wearing all grayscale.”
But your favorite members of the Mather community will undoubtedly be the House dogs: Kira, Cory, and Cheetah. “Cory is what keeps Mather going. He’s at every event and .... always saying hi to everybody,” according to HoCo co-chair Renee Hua ’22.
Freshmen who get into Mather can look forward to a tight knit community even during these isolating unprecedented times. Mather’s HoCo has adapted some of their traditions into the virtual world. Mather’s website boasts a “Meet Mather” section where incoming residents can meet fellow Matherites in a game similar to Quizlet. Mather HoCo regularly holds game nights and has replicated their popular Happy Hour over Zoom. Last year, Mather adapted their annual Louis Cup, traditionally a fall event where teams compete for points through different competitions: “We did a gingerbread building contest, an ugly sweater contest for the holidays. We did a pumpkin carving contest,” Hua explained.
Last year, the HoCo used its Instagram as its main platform for connecting with new Matherites. Each HoCo member had a day to take over the House’s Instagram. They gave virtual room tours, a virtual House tour, a welcome video, and answered any questions new Matherites had (the takeovers are on their Instagram highlights!). In addition to all these events, incoming Matherites all receive swag bags on Housing Day filled with housing merch. “We were able to mail shirts, water bottles, phone stickers, laptop stickers to all of the new Matherites … so they all have a piece of Mather merch,” Hua said.
Mather has the unbeatable perk of guaranteed singles every year. “Other Houses where traditionally sophomores may be in a hallway double — that won’t happen in Mather,” Kurilla said. Most sophomores are housed on the third floor of Mather’s low rise in a duplex, a two-story suite with a spacious common room, accommodating 4 to 5 people.
.
While sophomore housing in Mather is definitely luxurious, the other House amenities are just as impressive. Mather residents enjoy studying, eating, and hanging out with friends in their dining hall, complete with natural light and gorgeous views of the river. “Our dining hall is really our hub of social life,” according to Hua. And thanks to Mather’s system of tunnels, you won’t even have to go outside to get there!
Mather’s strong social life is bolstered by its infamous Junior Common Room, a large space for parties and mixers. But Mather is also the perfect setting for more wholesome gatherings, whether you want to watch “The Bachelor” with your blockmates in the Big TV room or have friends over in your common room (and show off your amazing housing, of course).
Want to know even more about everyone's favorite concrete jungle? Kurilla and Hua have you covered!
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House? 
RH: If you get into Mather, you will be so loved and supported. All our tutors are so genuine and care so much for your wellbeing. The Faculty Deans all want to get to know you and help make your life easier … Same with our res dean, he’s always just willing to sit down and talk and help you out with whatever you need. There’s so much support for a student in Mather. There’s so much diversity among the tutors that you would be hard pressed to find that you couldn't relate to any of the tutors.
MGK: From the moment you find out that you are going to live in Mather your sophomore year, you are part of the Mather community, and you will be welcomed in.
What do you think makes Mather special?
RH: The tight knit community. I think what makes Mather really really special is the fact that everyone knows everyone. It's a big House, not going to lie, but you can walk into the dining hall and be able to name basically every single person sitting there because of how much the House tries to facilitate community.
MGK: A lot of people have things to say about our architecture, but our architecture actually facilitates lots of relationships. If you think about it, in the low rise, you have four people living in a suite and then you connect directly to another four people living in another suite. And you have common rooms that can hold gatherings. So you really get to know lots of people when you have these big open spaces.
If you had to describe your House in 3 words what would they be?
RH: I'm going to let you pick, you're the English major. [Laughs]
MGK: Social, spirited, and supportive.
What is your favourite Mather memory?
MGK: I would say one of the best memories was sophomore orientation when we went to Spectacle Island. It was a day trip with all of the sophomores in Mather and the House advisors, the House administration. And it was really fun. There was a beach, you could go on a mini hike. I felt like I got to know most of the sophomore class during that.
What side of TikTok would Mather be on?
RH: The side of TikTok where people do kind of dumb things that are really, really funny. Like the girl that made the last shot of beer bong, and then got on the couch and leapt off the couch, landed on a table and broke the table in half. That side of TikTok.

Boasting the title of the largest House, Lev is full of bustling bunnies with lasting traditions led by a tight-knit House Committee. From the sophomore concentration celebrations to the huge senior dinner, Leverett is full of love to give and share for every class year. You’ll find yourself having to stop and admire Leveretts’s 14 story towers anytime you walk past, and you’ll likely be enticed into spending a good portion of your afternoon in their beautiful courtyard.
If you don’t already know someone in Lev, chances are, you will soon! Leverett is the largest House at Harvard and boasts a community that is just as spirited as it is large. The first thing you might notice about Lev is their love of their mascot, the hare. Fun fact: baby hares are called leverets, so Lev’s mascot is actually a pun!
Lev is all about frequent community events, from slam poetry to the interactive cooking series, Lev Loves to Cook, there’s usually something fun and engaging going on in the House during any given week. If you’re curious about the ~vibes~ of Leverett, look no further than their Housing Day videos. Their 2020 Housing Day video, set to Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy,” came out just a couple of days before students left campus last March and was truly show stopping. From quips like, “Size matters, don’t you know?” to subtle flexes about their IM records, the video featured lots of bunny ears, bunny costumes, and people scaling traffic lights in a bunny-like way. Each year, Lev’s video only gets more creative and hype; if you’re sorted into this House, you could be the next star of the show. Former HoCo chair Riley E. “Liz” Hoveland ’21 describes the dedicated creators behind the video, Leverett’s HoCo, as family and noted that there is a unique tradition of chairs staying with the House Committee after their term.
House faculty are full of Lev love, too! You’ll usually be greeted at Lev’s entrance by Paul, the building manager who is accessible and supportive. Hoveland shared a standout memory when she first learned about the great campus evictions of March 2020 while sitting in Paul’s office. She recalls being comforted by his presence when she was crying after the shocking news. Born and raised in Boston, Paul will make you feel right at home every time you enter Leverett. For freshmen looking to dive into their House’s community, there’s truly no better House than Leverett.
Although the virtual world has its challenges, Leverett has been keeping the house spirit alive with creative virtual events with free perks, like the Tea Club, which sends participants samples of different teas each month, or art workshops with materials furnished by the House. Hoveland dropped a hint of an upcoming event involving books, but wouldn’t tell us exactly what. Guess the future bunnies will have to let us know! If you’re the sorry-I-would-but-I-have-a-pset type, fret not! Lev also hosts “power hours” for bunnies that are procrastinating. “So, if you need to write that essay and you’re like me and get distracted by TikTok easily, it’s a good accountability space”, Hoveland says. Lev’s HoCo also has kept an active Instagram page (@LeverettHouse), which highlights students, pets, and faculty to keep followers updated on all things Lev during this remote year.
For first-years nervous about finding a family, the people you’ll meet at Leverett House are what makes the House truly something special, as Hoveland made sure to emphasize. “It’s not the buildings that make the House,” she notes, It's the people. And, the people in Leverett are the best people I’ve met at Harvard, and arguably some of the best people I’ve ever met.” Dang. Consider us impressed!
The largest House has no shortage of housing options for incoming bunnies! Sophomores are generally housed in the recently-renovated McKinlock Hall, the main Lev building that has the dining hall. Hoveland herself was housed in DeWolfe’s apartment-style housing during her sophomore year and loved having a kitchen to cook her own meals. However, she explains that the McKinlock set-up is also perfect for picking up meals and snacks during a busy week, since you can grab breakfast in your PJs without putting on any shoes on a lazy weekend morning (or when you’re running late to that horribly early Monday 9 a.m. class).
Juniors and seniors tend to be housed in spacious rooms with lots of singles in Lev’s towers. These are ideal for bigger blocking groups to stay on one floor together, instead of being split up like they would in many other Houses. If you have a large friend group, you’ll want to cross your fingers for Lev, because you just might be able to spend your time with all of them. The top floors are especially sought after because these rooms also overlook the scenic Charles with walls that are practically windows. New Leverites will also be pleasantly surprised by the hidden nooks and study spaces that dot Lev’s many hallways and rooms.
If all the amenities above didn’t already entice you to be a bunny, fear not. We asked the HoCo chairs those burning questions so that you didn’t have to. Get excited for your future House, full of fun and family:
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House? 
LEH: “The tutors are amazing and the support system you have is unmatched. We have tutors who were in Lev as students 14 years ago and are still in Lev as tutors because they love it so much. We have a lot of families so you really get to watch the kids grow up … We have a lot of cute pets and some great dogs... If you want a family, a good support system, and an amazing alumni network, Lev is the place for you.
What do you think makes your House special?
LEH: The people who work at Leverett are the best people you will ever meet, from the HUDS staff, to Amy, our House administrator, to Katie and Kim, who are our resident dean and our academic coordinator, and Paul, who’s our building manager ... You get to experience these people, and you get to really, really get to know them ... When we were told we were getting kicked off [last spring], [Bon Lee, who swipes students into the dhall] was immediately like ‘I got to friend you on Facebook’ and wanted to stay connected!
Biggest misconception about your House?
LEH: Everyone thinks Leverett is boring… honestly, people think bad about Leverett because they haven't experienced Leverett. Maybe on the outside it seems huge, like a ton of people, you don’t really get to know anyone… But if you actively put in the time to get to know people, you will be able to have amazing connections with everyone... There are people who have been working in that House for longer than I have been alive... Seeing other people love Leverett makes you love Leverett.
What Hogwarts House would your House get sorted into?
LEH: We’re Hufflepuff! I think we are the nicest people ... It’s a good House, you really just feel welcomed in and feel like you’re at home.
