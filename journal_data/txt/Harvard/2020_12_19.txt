After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School Professor Paul E. Farmer became the fifth recipient of the annual Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture, the Berggruen Institute announced Wednesday.
Farmer was awarded $1 million for his work in advancing “global public health equity” and pioneering healthcare systems, especially in Haiti and West Africa, according to the institute’s press release.
The award is given to “thinkers whose ideas have profoundly shaped human self-understanding and advancement in a rapidly changing world,” the release reads. Farmer, who holds the highest faculty rank as a University professor, joins Harvard Law School alumna and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg among the award's recepients.
Berggruen Institute Chairman Nicolas Berggruen wrote in an emailed statement that though the prize jury chose philosophers in the award’s first three years, “the award is so much broader than academic Philosophy.”
“Each laureate was chosen because they have taken their ideas, given them practical power, and improved our world,” Berggruen wrote. “Ideas matter not just because they are held by philosophers but because they act in the world, as evident in the Jury selection of Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and now with Dr. Paul Farmer.”
New York University philosophy professor Kwame Anthony Appiah, who chaired the prize jury, wrote in an email that Farmer has taken a “powerful set of ideas” and “put them to use in doing enormous good in the world.”
“The prize seeks to honor the ways in which deep thinking can do great good: Paul Farmer exemplifies that perfectly,” Appiah wrote.
Medical School Professor of Medical Anthropology Arthur M. Kleinman said that Farmer’s contributions toward reimagining global healthcare have allowed for the poorest populations to receive the highest level of care for disorders, epidemics, and pandemics, including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and Covid-19.
“He has set out the agenda for how we rethink global health in such a way as to see how colonialism and the post-colonial period strongly influence global health institutions and create barriers to the delivery of healthcare to the poorest populations in the world and how these can be overcome,” Kleinman said.
“He richly deserves this award for that great accomplishment,” Kleinman added.
Medical School Professor of Global Health and Social Medicine Salmaan A. Keshavjee described Farmer as a “remarkably kind” and “very thoughtful” individual who “always finds the good in everybody” and whose life has been driven by helping others.
Keshavjee noted that the Prize is conventionally awarded to philosophers, but said Farmer’s work has had philosophical implications that have “led to a big cultural transformation in global health.”
He also said Farmer has questioned “neoliberal ideas” that do not distribute healthcare on the basis of need. Instead, Farmer considers healthcare in terms of ethical implications and human life, per Keshavjee.
Medical School Dean for Clinical and Academic Affairs Anne E. Becker ’83 agreed with Keshavjee, pointing to the way that Farmer’s work straddles academic thought and on-the-ground care.
“He has this rare talent to walk between these two worlds,” Becker said. “He’s written now, what, 11 or 12 books, and to be able to be on the ground, doing the work, and to then take a step back and teach his readership about structural violence, health inequities, and really galvanize, mobilize the next generation toward promoting health justice.”
In 1987, Farmer co-founded Partners in Health, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid in 11 countries. Farmer also developed the accompaniment model of care, which provides patients social support during their long-term drug regimens to ensure they complete the full treatment, according to Farmer’s colleague, Barry R. Bloom, who is a research professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Bloom said Farmer “inspires every student that he meets” and has been “one of the greatest stimulators of people going into global health” in the world.
Bloom recalled that in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Farmer volunteered Partners in Health staff and students to serve as contract tracers when there was a shortage of public health staff.
Farmer’s model is “respecting and improving the quality of life of human beings, not just treating the sickness — caring for the person,” Bloom said.
As for the Prize funding, Bloom said he can hazard a guess as to how Farmer will spend it.
“I know Paul Farmer well enough to know the vast majority, if not all of that, is going to go into Partners in Health, rather than into a better lifestyle for Paul and his family,” Bloom said.
Farmer did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Monday interview he has “a great deal of confidence” that upperclassmen invited to return to campus for the spring semester will adhere to Covid-19 residential rules.
Harvard’s housing plan for the spring semester — which welcomes roughly half of all undergraduates to fill 3,100 beds on campus — prioritizes seniors and currently enrolled juniors, rather than freshmen as it did in the fall.
Students living on campus during the fall semester were required to sign a community compact assuring their compliance with social distancing and other safety guidelines, a requirement which will continue this spring. The College also developed a Community Council — composed of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members — to enforce the compact.
Khurana acknowledged that seniors and juniors returning to campus in the spring will reunite with old social “connections,” unlike freshmen, who arrived without existing friendships. He said, however, that he believes these connections will encourage upperclassmen to observe community compact guidelines, rather than flout residential rules.
“Those connections will, in fact, even make it easier for us to realize our mutual obligations to each other to keep each other safe because our students are more likely to know about each other,” he said. “Right from the get-go, they know that different people have different health conditions.”
Khurana also said he believes upperclassmen are especially committed to the “health and well-being” of Harvard staff members.
“They also know how important it is to keep our dining hall workers safe, our custodial workers safe, our frontline safe — that these are not just ancillary folks, but they’re core members of our community,” he said.
“I have a great deal of confidence in our upper-class students precisely because they understand the mission of educating citizens and citizen-leaders for society is a mission not about maximizing one’s individual needs, but rather putting oneself in community,” he added.
Khurana also said student compliance with the compact in the fall set an example for undergraduates arriving in the spring as well as Harvard’s graduate school students.
“They’ve set such a great bar for showing us the way, and they adapted when we had to adapt,” he said of the students living on campus this fall.
In one case of the Community Council adjudicating on student violations of the community compact, Harvard sent home three freshmen living in Mather House after they hosted a September party in their dorm.
Khurana also said student input from the fall informed a number of changes to the community compact ahead of the spring semester — most notably, the introduction of color-coded reopening levels.
The system — with the strictest of guidelines beginning at “Level 0: Purple” — uses colors to represent the gradual reopening of on-campus spaces. The highest level — “Level 5: Green” — would permit small social gatherings.
Khurana said the development of color-coded phasing aims to “clarify the importance of the community compact” and ensure greater transparency around campus reopening decisions.
Khurana concluded that he has been “really pleased” with how undergraduates have risen to meet challenges posed by the pandemic. Their conduct, he said, has affirmed his confidence in the student body.
“I knew these things were already in our community — the resilience, the commitment to each other, the commitment to truth, and the creation of knowledge,” he said. “It was great to see that continue and even become more resolute during this moment.”
