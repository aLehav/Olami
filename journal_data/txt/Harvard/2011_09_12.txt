After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On September 30, 1935 the Colonial Theater in Boston staged the first-ever production of George Gershwin’s classic American opera “Porgy and Bess.” In the brief run at the Colonial, Gershwin and the two librettists, Ira Gershwin and DuBose Hayward, made drastic cuts to the original work in preparation for the show’s Broadway premiere. 76 years later, “Porgy and Bess” has returned to the Boston area, again in preparation for a Broadway run. Once again, the work on display now is radically different from the original.
This adaptation is billed as “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” and is directed by Diane Paulus ’88, the Artistic Director of the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.). The production seeks to reappraise the opera for modern times. By far the most controversial change is a wholesale rewriting of the ending, in which it turns out that our leading man, newly outfitted with a cane and two functioning legs, might just land the leading babe.
Stephen Sondheim, the Zeus of musical theater who wrote classics such as “Into The Woods” and “Sweeney Todd” as well as lyrics for “West Side Story,” struck at Paulus’ production with a lighting bolt. In an open letter to the New York Times, Sondheim claimed that Paulus did not understand the basic ideas behind characterization in the opera and condescended to her audience.
For theater to remain vital, producers and directors have to find a way of attracting new and younger audiences. One of the most powerful weapons in their arsenal is adapting older works to make them more relevant for contemporary viewers. But what is at stake in an act of reinterpretation?
PLOTLINE POLITICS
It is no real surprise that this debate is happening over a revival of “Porgy.” When the opera opened 80 years ago, it was a radical statement on racial politics. A Jewish composer had given African-Americans the right to portray their struggles on a stage in front of the white majority. “Gershwin was writing an opera for black singers [who had] almost nowhere else to turn, at least in terms of mainstream visibility,” says musicologist and Harvard Professor Carol J. Oja.  It would take almost a generation for African-Americans to perform another work in a major U.S. opera house. “At the Metropolitan Opera, the first time an African-American singer was on the stage was 1955. The first black person to perform with the New York City Opera was in 1945,” says Oja. Otherwise, African-Americans were still portrayed in blackface.
Paulus is not attempting to challenge prejudice. In this sense, the play’s topical impetus has changed as racial views have evolved over time. The new conception is apolitical, and seeks to find timeless subjects in Gershwin’s opera. For example, the characters have been partially re-written to give them a backstory. Bess, once a plotline prop to facilitate the conflict between the main male characters, has been fleshed out beyond recognition. “Her quest is to humanize the former classics, and she gets a lot of flak for that,” says Hilton Als, the theater critic for The New Yorker who also teaches at Wellesley University. Paulus’ interest in humanization, however, amounts to bodily reinvention, closer to a new creation than a subtle touch-up.
THEATER TRENCHES
Paulus has devoted her career to this philosophy of updating theater, which she has held since her youth. Born into an affluent New York City family, she was surrounded by art since birth. While an undergraduate at Harvard, she realized that the theater was a way of combining her passions for pubic service and art. In an interview given to the Boston Globe in 2008, she said that during the summer of her freshman year she addressed a meeting of the Coalition for the Homeless in Boston as an intern for then–city councilor Ruth Messinger. She realized that instead of being a politician, she would much rather forge connections with real people on the ground. “Politics to a degree is about legislation, administration. You can’t be there in the trenches. I had this epiphany that I like the interaction with people. I wanted to make things happen at a grassroots level.” As such, her career as a theatre director has been marked by a populist streak.
After earning her Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in Theatre Direction, Paulus co-founded the New York–based theater group Project 400. “The impetus for founding Project 400 was to make theater that was popular but also classic,” says Anna Foss Wilson, an actress and director who studied at Columbia with Paulus and was a founding member of Project 400. The group distinguished itself by a commitment to collaboration and adaptation. “We would create a show, and during the beginning of the rehearsal process I would be asked to bring a complete character to rehearsal,” recalls Foss Wilson, laughing. “Diane would interview me in character, and that would go into the final script.” The play itself was mutable, a fluid text that could be shaped not just by the author but also by the production process itself.
MAKING HEADLINES
Since then Paulus’ rise in the theater world has been meteoric. After almost 10 years of work with Project 400 on the fringe of the theater scene, she began directing shows on Broadway and at major opera houses around the world. Her resume includes the recent revival of the musical “Hair,” a smash hit both on Broadway and in London’s West End, as well as a production of “Kiss Me Kate” at The Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, New York. Paulus also conceived and directed “The Donkey Show,” which had a seven-year run in New York before it came to the A.R.T. at Club OBERON in Cambridge.
Her productions of ”Hair” and “The Donkey Show” both emphasized audience participation. For her, the theater is an arena for the interaction between art and the audience. Visceral connection is prioritized over conceptual premise. “Our work came from a desire to not cage people in their theater seats,” says Foss Wilson.  “In a sense we wanted to free the audience.” In “The Donkey Show,” this liberation was achieved by literally mixing the audience in with the actors; in “Hair,” which was staged in older theaters with a much more traditional layout, the process was reversed. During one number cast members literally climb on the seats, directly on top of the audience members. Instead of instilling a contemplative detachment in the audience’s experience of a play, Paulus’ casts come to them. The audience is part of the stage itself.
For theater to be populist, it helps to make headlines. “It is a dream come true to make an old distinguished white guy angry,” says Anna Foss Wilson about Stephen Sondheim’s open letter. “The controversy is going to make more people want to see the show.”
Until her decision to change the ending of “Porgy,” Paulus had never gone so far as to change the plot of a classic work. “Some works audiences don’t mind people tinkering with,” says David Cote, a theater critic for Time Out New York, “but this is different because the production is changing the text, and this raises some heckles.” Stephen Sondheim, for his part, raised the concern at the end of his letter. “In the interest of truth in advertising, let it not be called ‘The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess,’ nor even ‘The Gershwin-Heyward Porgy and Bess.’ Advertise it honestly as ‘Diane Paulus’s Porgy and Bess.’ And the hell with the real one.”
SWITCH OFF
“There is definitely a line between what your vision is as a director and what the author’s or creator’s vision for the show is,” says Jesse T. Nee-Vogelmann ’13, who directed “6 Characters In Search of an Author” last year at the Loeb Experimental Theater. “At the very beginning of the process you have to make a decision about how you are going to handle this.” This production of the famous piece by Luigi Pirandello was conceived from the very beginning to be an adaptation of the original work that was meant to fit into the context of the Harvard undergraduate experience. “Some changes were small, ranging from things we just don’t use anymore like a prompter and a prompters hut. Instead of someone taking notes in shorthand, someone would be taking notes on a computer, and someone had to run and get their charger.” However, none of these changes affected the plot or overall message of the play. Vogelmann sought to make the play more accessible to an audience of Harvard students without sacrificing the original intent of the play. “What adaptation is about is finding out what the core of the production is and seeing what you need to do to make that come across stronger.”
This mentality aims to revive theatre as a medium. “In a lot of ways theater in America doesn’t get as much respect and support as other art forms because it is generally considered boring—with the exception of Broadway—so adaptation is really important in getting audiences to see theatre,” says Vogelman. Adaptation can be seen to some extent as a marketing tactic. For Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson Arts editor and student director at Harvard, reinterpretation is also a way of keeping theater relevant. “If we were still doing all productions of Shakespeare in traditional Elizabethan costume, and we did opera the way it was done in the 17th and 18th centuries, I think modern audiences would switch off."
KEEPING IT FRESH
It may be fitting that controversy is returning to “Porgy.” “The fact that Sondheim spoke out so strongly shows how important it is to revisit the opera. Clearly nerves were touched, but then you know that you’re doing something really alive and touching something central to the culture, and that’s only positive,” says Oja. Updating a work, regardless of its artistic merit, has value in its ability to breathe life into the otherwise dusty projects of our collective past. Looking at a play or an opera in a new light also gives us an opportunity for cultural reevaluation. “If a classic work can’t survive a new window dressing then maybe it isn’t as bulletproof as we thought,” says Cote.
The good news: no matter what the final word on Paulus’ work is, “Porgy and Bess” will continue to provoke. It has already survived numerous changes: the opera became a musical in 1942, all-instrumental album by jazz great Miles Davis in 1958, and finally a movie a year later. “We all have our favorite books, our favorite art works, our favorite chairs in our living rooms that we don’t want to recover. We become used to certain things, objects of beauty that give us pleasure, and it can be very hard to watch them be altered. This doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be altered, but it can be difficult,” says Oja. “Porgy,” when thought of as simply a piece of artistic history, is predictable and safe, but also runs the risk of turning stale. Individual reinterpretations can sink or sail, but the process of reevaluation is vitally important for keeping culture fresh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nick George, a 22-year-old senior at Pomona College, learned first-hand how post-9/11 security measures can affect anyone.
Nick had become interested in Middle Eastern studies and, in August 2009, he decided to occupy himself during the long flight back to school from his home in Philadelphia by studying his Arabic-English flashcards. When security screeners spotted the flashcards, they pulled him aside. He was handcuffed, detained in a cell at the airport police station, and aggressively interrogated for some five hours. “Do you know who did 9/11?” When Nick meekly responded “Osama bin Laden,” he was asked “Do you know what language he spoke?” “Do you see why these cards are suspicious?”
After his Kafkaesque ordeal finally ended, Nick continued to be bothered by his first-hand knowledge that the system allowed this type of senseless harassment. If it happened to him, it could also happen to others. So he went to the ACLU and became a plaintiff in a constitutional challenge called George v. TSA (see http://www.aclu.org/national-security/george-v-tsa).
Nick is not the only one to be troubled by the post-9/11 dragnets the government insisted on deploying after 9/11 —just in case more sweeping surveillance and more all-encompassing criminal laws might catch a terrorist who might not otherwise be caught. It is of course inevitable that these dragnets will sweep in ordinary, innocent Americans like Nick. 
But the dragnets are still with us because so many people assume that they themselves will not be affected if they are not guilty of anything; that we need to just trust the government to use its vast powers only against the truly guilty; that the powers conferred by the Patriot Act, etc., must be working because there has not been another major terrorist attack in the US since 9/11; that abuse of discretion is not a problem now that George W. Bush is no longer in the White House; that we can’t actually participate in policy decisions in this area anyway because necessary secrecy prevents us from assessing either the benefits or the costs of all those powers. 
I wrote a book, Taking Liberties: The War on Terror and the Erosion of American Democracy, to illuminate the costs of our current strategies and to question the assumptions that have allowed these strategies to become rooted in our legal system. Some are simply illogical (lack of an attack obviously does not prove that every controversial power has helped to prevent attacks). Others are inconsistent with the fundamental premises of our American democracy (the Constitution does not demand that we trust our elected leaders, but trusts “we, the people” to be the true government). Others are incorrect (although Barack Obama tried to change our policies with respect to detentions at Guantanamo and “harsh interrogation techniques,” in the areas my book covers—domestic antiterrorism measures—he has fought to preserve all the powers Bush claimed, including a screen of secrecy that keeps us from knowing how those powers are being used). And Nick George’s story is just one of many examples demonstrating why just trusting the executive branch not to abuse vast powers, often wielded in secret, is just as bad an idea as the authors of the Constitution thought. 
The decade-long battle over our antiterrorism strategies has created American heroes as well as victims. Nick George is one of those heroes. Another Nicholas, Nick Merrill, an Internet service provider, received a “National Security Letter” from the FBI demanding information about one of his clients. He also became an ACLU client because, having studied constitutional law at Hampshire College, he didn’t think that such serious invasions of privacy should be allowed without a court order. (In these days of cloud computing, just think about how much information your internet service provider has about your life!) Nick was also indignant that a gag order prohibited him from ever telling anyone—including Congress, a lawyer, or a court—anything at all about his own experience with the Patriot Act. The same gag order prohibited him from revealing that he was the plaintiff in his “John Doe” lawsuit, for the unbelievable period of six years. 
But like his namesake, Nick Merrill is exceptional in his willingness to stand up for our rights. Hundreds of thousands of National Security Letter demands have been made in the past decade, but so far as we know, Nick was one of only six recipients who challenged the government’s power to chip away at our privacy and free speech in this manner.
Will you be one of the patriots who cares enough to find out how the hastily conferred powers in the USA Patriot Act are being used and then think about whether some of them should be modified? Or will you be one of the multitudes willing to let our constitutional heritage slip away by doing nothing, soothed by assumptions that are probably untrue?
 For an in-depth account of why you should care about this, you can read my book. For suggestions about what we can all do to limit the damage, you can visit http://www.aclu.org and read A Call to Courage: Reclaiming our Liberties Ten Years after 9/11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I lived through 9/11 and its aftermath in law enforcement, as New Jersey’s Attorney General, and have spent much of the past decade— first with the 9/11 Commission, and then as a private attorney—trying to piece together what happened so that such an attack never happens again. As I reflect on that day and its aftermath, however, I am struck not by facts or arguments but by images.
What was—what is—9/11 to me?
It was lifting off in the National Guard helicopter that night, flattening the grass in Liberty State Park where hundreds of ambulances waited with their lights flashing, it was lifting and flying over the glowing Hudson and banking high over the storeys-high pile of twisted steel and fire and acrid smoke, above the helpless arcs of water from the FDNY trucks, above the silhouettes of desperate men spotlit to look gigantic in the hum of generators as they searched the debris.
It was that night of a thousand unanswered questions. How many were dead? 10,000? 20,000? The makeshift trauma center at Liberty State Park was filled with wounded men and women transported in State Police boats across the Hudson, but there were reports from the State Police of commuter rail parking lots from Princeton to Westfield to Rumson jammed with thousands of unclaimed cars. 
It was public order dissolving all around amid mistaken reports of dancing on the rooftops of mosques, vigilantes roaming the streets, Israeli commandos, terrorists with exploding backpacks.
Then came days of perfect planeless skies at the site and the heat and the smell confected of concrete dust and melted steel and glass and paper and wood and flesh, the sunlight glinting from a billion shards of glass, rescue dogs panting in the shadows, a woman’s severed foot in a high heel, the searching and the solemn celebrations of the first responder dead being carried like Jesus through the smoke.
Then weeks later it was a chapel, improvised in a waiting room of the old train station in Liberty State Park, the waiting benches for passengers become pews, long white candles shining on the dark wood, temporary booths hung with white sheets, the Salvation Army there in force to distribute urns of Trade Center earth. I was there representing law enforcement to present the folded American flags. The line of families stretched as far as I could see, at least a few thousand souls, shuffling into the station chapel, crying, silent, looking up and down and into nothing. 
It was the elderly woman who approaching alone, graying black hair pulled back above her black dress, tied with a black ribbon, and it was her voice, not loud but searing, her eyes searching without seeing, “Where is my son? Where is my son?”
It was Fresh Kills landfill, close to Christmas, the site fogged in, a white mist falling, gray white seagulls circling as if formed from clouds, the smoke from Ground Zero faint in the air. It was conveyor belts of debris vibrating past the police and federal agents in hazmat suits who scoured for evidence or remains, their faces puffy and sleep-deprived, passing around a burned badge of a Port Authority police officer, recovering a nearly intact bronze of a human torso, a piece of landing gear from the planes, treating every finger or toe or rib or jawbone as a sacred relic, carrying them off to a Quonset hut for preservation as if entering a cathedral. 
I can’t but wonder whether I remember these things now the way that I do because the memories come refracted through later events because we killed Bin Laden the way that we did; his death imparts an order to the chaos of those days. The images rest more easily with me because the horror they project feels in some way lessened by his death. Any other outcome would have left those images unanswered in their horror. Any other outcome would have denied the change that 9/11 effected.
For we are different now. There is vengeance in our hearts, and vengeance is the justice that comes before law, the unsustainable justice that law cannot reach and must eventually replace.
Someday it will, when the images rest more quietly within our souls. Someday peace will bring a new, a better, form of justice.
For now, the flaming ruins, the quiet moaning of the families with their urns and their flags, the white dust rising into the mist beneath the seagulls’ cry at Freshkills, find an answer in a shot to the head and a shrouded body scattered to the wide sea. It is justice of a type, a justice sustainable not by law, but by power. But this is our age, an age in which we wake every day knowing that someone means to kill us, in which, as Rimbaud put it, “We know how to give our whole lives every day. Behold the time of the Assassins.”
Like Job’s wife in Archibald Macleish’s J.B, we have lived
 
Among the ashes.
All there is now of the town is ashes.
Mountains of ashes. Shattered glass.
Glittering cliffs of glass all shattered …
 You wanted justice, didn’t you?
 
We did. We still do. But as we look to a world beyond our age, to the world of tomorrow that will be created by the students of today, who are the children of 9/11, the desire for justice involves accepting that all forms of justice are imperfect, and that rough justice must someday be sublimated to law or the world will perish. 
Rest was fitful for the officers at Freshkills, sleeping in a tent with an artificial Christmas tree standing near a grief-counseling station. “Sometimes it’s too much,” said the weary NYPD Lieutenant in charge, “sometimes they need to talk, or just to sleep.” Christmas carols played softly from a boom box as the workers slept dreamless in the tee shirts the team designed, the shirts that read, simply, “Opus Dei.”
God’s work.

When the Boeing 767 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 in the morning, 6,000 miles away in Israel, Sept. 11 was nearing an uneventful end. It only took a few minutes, however, for a weary public all too familiar with conflict and chaos to tune into the various media outlets and start making sense of the terrible rumors of a devastating terror attack in the heart of western civilization. As teenagers growing up in Jerusalem during the second Palestinian Intifada, a bloody wave of suicide bombings that claimed hundreds of civilian lives, we were accustomed to grim headlines; nothing, though, could prepare us for the magnitude of this unprecedented tragedy.
While the world slowly came to terms with that fateful day, in Israel, we empathized with a reality so tragically familiar to our own and so inherently foreign to Americans - the fear and trauma of living in a society whose every playground, shopping mall, restaurant and public bus had become the frontline of a battlefield.
Growing up in this reality and serving in the army, we witnessed the Israeli psyche suffer blow after blow and gradually become jaded by the constant threat of terror. Perpetual fear made Israelis insular, prone to aggression and innately mistrusting of ‘the other’. This collective trauma and sense of disillusionment are partially responsible for the Israeli paralysis toward making major concessions for peace with the Palestinians. Similarly, over the last ten years, we can identify parallels in the western world’s response to terrorism. Sept. 11 continues to claim new casualties every day. Two wars have been declared and fought overseas, while in some western cities it has become unsafe for Muslims in Chador, Hijab, turban and beard to walk the streets. Islam has become the target of unwarranted condemnation based on the actions of a few morally perverse fundamentalists, while religion is perceived as the root of global conflict, rather than as a facilitator of compassion and constructive change.
As a result, the generation of 9/11, our generation, has been brought up to think in black and white: The world is destined for eternal conflict stemming from an irreconcilable cultural and religious divide, or there will only be peace once we dissolve all countries, abolish all religions, and march in unison as a collective homogenous horde.
We’d like to suggest a third option. As young participants of a multicultural global community, our challenge is to ground ourselves unapologetically in our own individual identities, religions and cultures, celebrate what makes us special and unique, and, at the same time, harness our individualism to further mutual respect and understanding. Rather than fear our differences, we can embrace them, move beyond absolutist dogma to acknowledge and appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of every person and belief.  The real “clash of civilizations” isn’t between east and west, but between moderates who promote peace and extremists who oppose it.
On the tenth anniversary of Sept. 11, we honor and remember the thousands who died on, since, and as a result of that day. We honor the countless families and communities affected by the ongoing conflict—on all sides. And we acknowledge that no single person, community, or culture has a monopoly on suffering.
Memory and mourning leave us two choices: We can either sink deep into the pits of despair, unwilling to recognize the humanity of the other, or we can begin the process of healing, acknowledging that while the pain may never subside, wounds heal and can become a force for compassion, understanding, and reconciliation.  The choice is ours: Will we allow ourselves to be shaped by September 11th, or will we shape our own future and build a more peaceful, better world?

"Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.”
So begins Joan Didion’s 2004 memoir, The Year of Magical Thinking, an attempt to make sense of the year in which she lost both her husband and her daughter. To be sure, Didion’s memoir grapples with epoch-altering events in the life of just one individual, but it also speaks to the immediacy, the inexplicability, and the finality of a recent epoch-altering event in the lives of all Americans and countless others across the world.
This event, of course, is “9/11,” when, ten years ago yesterday, four hijacked jets took nearly 3,000 lives and, in the process, destroyed the Twin  Towers in New York City and parts of the Pentagon in Arlington, Va. A decade later, it is not an overstatement to say that the events of Sept. 11, 2001 have, in a sense, transformed the past ten years of American life. This country has gone to war not once, but twice in those years, and the memories of that day continue to inflame some of the best and worst tendencies of the American psyche: patriotism and solidarity on the one hand; bigotry and hawkishness on the other.
In our perspective, however, one of the most visible transformations 9/11 made on the country was on our generation, children who grew up in the relatively placid 1990s, and who—in at least some sense—lost their innocence on the same day, Sept. 11, 2001, after which nothing has ever quite been the same. To return to Didion: “You sit down to dinner”—or, in our case, perhaps arrive at school one bright fall morning—“and life as you know it ends.”
For the young people of this country, it seems fair to say that the last ten years have been a time of struggling to come to terms with the memory of that fateful day and everything that has transpired since. However, in the coming ten years, we have faith in the potential of these common memories to unite, to motivate, and to inspire. At a time when the United States is undergoing drastic transformation in almost every imaginable way, we can only hope that the next ten years will show a generation united by these memories and, for the sake of honoring them, committed to bettering their country and themselves.
In the meantime, however, we remember the victims of 9/11 and the terror and confusion of the last ten years. To that end, we have selected here a number of opinion pieces that, we hope, speak to at least a small portion of the memorable experiences and salient issues to have come out of that day.

Twenty-one Harvard donors have pledged to withhold further donations to the University until Harvard switches to providing exclusively cage-free eggs in its dining halls, according to Humane League Campaign Coordinator David Coman-Hidy.
A campaign organized by students and assisted by the Humane League contacted benefactors from three donor societies—the Harvard Yard Society, Harvard Medal Recipients, and the 1636 Society.
“As a financial supporter of the College, I would like to think that my money is going to support an administration that is both responsive to its students and responsible towards the environment and animals,” read the letter signed by the boycotters. “I look forward to hearing back from your office with news of a complete switch to cage-free eggs—until then, I will not be making any more donations.”
In 2007, HUHDS answered a student campaign with a partial switch to cage-free eggs. Currently, all shelled eggs that are cooked individually—including hard-boiled eggs and fried eggs made at the grill—come from cage-free farms. These account for about 20 percent of the eggs used in Harvard dining halls.
But other entrees, including scrambled eggs, are made with liquid eggs from farms that use battery-cage methods.
AnnaLise S. Hoopes, who started the original campaign in 2006 while she was a graduate student at Harvard, said that while the University “took a courageous step toward ending these practices,” she would like to see Harvard make the full commitment to cage-free.
“I think it is wrong to support an industry which inflicts abuse and suffering on thousands of voiceless animals,” Hoopes said.
In this year’s more recent campaign, 5,000 Harvard students and faculty signed a petition supporting the use of cage-free eggs, according to Marina N. Bolotnikova ’14, one of the students spearheading the movement.
Ted A. Mayer, assistant vice president for hospitality and dining services, responded to a student petition and letters in a blog post in April.
Mayer cited nutritional, safety, humanitarian, and economic reasons for continuing to purchase from battery-cage farms.
Mayer pointed out that cage-free farms do not guarantee humane treatment because even cage-free facilities have been shown to have problems, including space constraints, de-beaking, and bird-on-bird aggression.
“In my ideal world people wouldn’t eat eggs at all,” Bolotnikova said. “I think cage-free, though imperfect, is a really important first step in thinking about where our food comes from.”
Bolotnikova, also a Crimson editorial editor, said that she believes that the economic costs are HUHDS’s primary concern.
“They haven’t really been as open as I would have liked,” she said.
Mayer wrote that the costs of switching to cage-free would be about $100,000.
Many of Harvard’s peers have made the switch. Yale, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania are all exclusively cage-free.

Academics, policy makers, and professionals discussed the current state of female employment in America on Friday at “The New Majority? The Past, Present, and Future of Women in the Workplace” symposium.
Speakers stressed that though women have made gains in the workplace during the past several decades, they have yet to achieve parity with men.
“Women still hold 75 percent of clerical jobs,” said History Professor Nancy F. Cott, director of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study’s Schlesinger Library. “Women are almost two thirds of the workforce earning minimum wage.”
The symposium, sponsored by the Radcliffe Institute, was opened by University President Drew G. Faust, the Institute’s former dean and the first female University President in Harvard’s 375-year history.
“The history of women has served as such an important point of inspiration, change, and progress for the ways women’s lives have been transformed in our lifetimes,” Faust said.
Heidi Hartmann, founder and president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in Washington D.C., said that the progress women have achieved in the workforce has come to a standstill since the late 1990s.
“It’s been a crappy recovery for everyone, but...men have regained 30 percent of the jobs they lost and women only 10 percent of the jobs they lost,” Hartmann said.
Though the symposium stressed the gravity of the current state of gender inequality in the workplace, the speakers lightened the mood with jokes and laughter.
“The first question we need to figure out is: why do women earn so little money?” Director of Family Values @ Work Ellen Bravo said, asking audience members to discuss this question amongst themselves.
“Because their employers pay them so little money!” Bravo said with a smile. The crowd erupted in laughter.
But once the audience’s giggles died down, Bravo took on a more serious tone.
“So we need to figure out why their employers pay them so little money, why women are undervalued in the workplace,” she said.
The symposium honored the late Clara Goldberg Schiffer ’32. Her daughter, Lois J. Schiffer ’66, urged attendees to continue the work of her mother’s generation in achieving gender equality.
“It is upon all of us to stand on [Clara Schiffer’s] shoulders and make the task complete,” Schiffer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many students at Harvard, it all began in the classrooms of their elementary schools. Ten years later, they remembered the attacks of September 11, 2001 in their dorm, at church, or in the common room with friends and family.
Katherine M. Olaskiewicz ’13, who attended a Catholic school in Staten Island with the view of Manhattan from the window, recalled her teacher closing all the blinds.
As an anxious child, Olaskiewicz said she started getting nervous and feeling sick. She went to the nurse’s office before her mother came to pick her up.
“I have little snapshots of memory from 9/11,” she said. “It’s not one big, long, continuous chain of story.”
Olaskiewicz said the ten-year anniversary is a day to remember those who sacrificed their lives for others, including her best friend’s father—a firefighter and her softball coach—who died in the attack.
Though Olaskiewicz had a relatively normal day—brunch in Currier dining hall with her roommate, reading in the lawn, and a trip to the mall to buy a charger—she attended the college-wide vigil to express her emotion and feel the sense of community.
“[9/11] isn’t about being afraid, being angry, or being sad,” she said. “For me, it is a day that really symbolizes the courage and the strength of the people in America, and the good in people’s heart, that they can give up everything for those they have never met before.”
Kristina Arakelyan ’13, a Brooklyn native, said she was chatting with her new classmates when a loud speaker announcement blared across the room. Soon, the parents came to pick up their children one by one.
“I couldn’t understand why students all the sudden had to go home,” Arakelyan said. “We were just children. We really didn’t understand what was going on.”
Arakelyan said she did not attend any memorial services at Harvard, but called her family in the morning to discuss the day.
“Most people in New York don’t talk about it much. It’s just too traumatic for them,” Arakelyan said, adding that her father worked at a building next to the World Trade Center in 2001.
Brendan C. Quinn ’12 and Andrew P. Ostapchenko ’12, both from California, said they too remembered the day vividly.
“It destroyed the idea that as long as you are in the U.S., you are totally safe,” Quinn said.
Both had brunch in Pforzheimer dining hall before Ostapchenko headed off to a rehearsal for a choir. Ostapchenko said he also attended the candlelight vigil.
James S. Ong ’12, who lived in New Jersey at the time, said 9/11 is a symbol of how people can come together during hard times.
Ong encouraged people to move on and continue their lives instead of dwelling only on the past.
Like many football fans on the first Sunday of the season, he spent the day watching sports with his roommates.
Even in the games, teams paid tribute to the victims by wearing commemorative jerseys and observing a moment of silence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a September morning eerily similar to the same day 10 years ago, Memorial Church rang its bells on Sunday at 8:46 a.m., 9:03 a.m., 9:37 a.m., and 10:06 a.m. to commemorate the times when two hijacked plans slammed into the World Trade Center, another smashed into the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field. With the tolling of the second bell, a girl crossing Tercentenary Theatre paused to make the sign of the cross.
And across the country, Americans gathered to remember the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001—a day that claimed more than 3,000 lives.
In New York City, more than 10,000 victims’ relatives gathered at what is now called ground zero, where political leaders descended to address the day’s significance.
“Friends and neighbors; sisters and brothers; mothers and fathers; sons and daughters—they were taken from us with heartbreaking swiftness and cruelty,” President Barack Obama said. “On Sept. 12, 2001, we awoke to a world in which evil was closer at hand, and uncertainty clouded our future.”
Obama spoke of patriotism and resilience, citing the heroism of the passengers of United Airlines 93, who took control of one of the hijacked plane, crashing it into a field near Shanksville, Pa.
“Shanksville is the scene of friendships forged between residents of that town, and families who lost loved ones there,” Obama said. “Where the World Trade Center once stood, the sun glistens off a new tower that reaches toward the sky.”
Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dismissed the terrorists’ attempt to “destroy America’s spirit,” in Saturday’s weekly Republican address.
“As we consider the rescue and recovery effort we witnessed at the time of and in the aftermath of the attacks, it’s clear that the terrorists failed,” said Giuliani, who became known as “America’s Mayor” in the aftermath of the attacks.
During the ceremony at ground zero, family members read off the names of the victims, sometimes speaking briefly about their deceased loved one.
In one address, a young boy, Nicholas Gorki, recalled his father, “who I never met because I was in my mother’s belly. I love you, Father. You gave me the gift of life, and I wish you could be here to enjoy it with me.”
Another, the wife of a police officer who died in a rescue attempt, said how every year, the memorial became more significant.
“My kids are 25, 21, 18. They understand now,” Barbara Gorman said at a service for the Port Authority dead. “It’s not so much a tragedy anymore as history, the history of our country.”
The speeches were delivered at the new memorial of the attacks­—two 30-foot deep pools that stand in the twin towers’ footprints.
Throughout the day, family members of those who died in the attacks traced the names of their relatives, which are etched into the bronze panels on the pools’ borders.
At the Pentagon, Vice President Joseph Biden praised the “9/11 generation” as one of history’s greatest.
“Never before in our history has America asked so much over such a sustained period of an all-volunteer force,” he said. “So I can say without fear of contradiction or being accused of exaggeration, the 9/11 generation ranks among the greatest our nation has ever produced, and it was born—it was born—it was born right here on 9/11.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of a troubled labor market and national economic uncertainty, economists at Harvard have expressed mixed opinions about President Obama’s jobs proposal, which would offer a package of tax cuts and spending projects totaling $447 billion.
In a nationally-televised speech to Congress last Thursday night, Obama called upon lawmakers from both parties to “stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.”
Yet even among Harvard professors, there seems to be no clear consensus on whether the jobs bill is what the nation needs to revitalize an economy that saw no net job growth in the month of August.
In an interview on Friday, Economics Professor James H. Stock called the plan “a fundamentally sound proposal” and emphasized the need for Congress to pass the package in its entirety.
“Right now there’s tremendous uncertainty, and that has a substantial dampening effect on the economy. Increasing employment and output through proactive measures like this will decrease uncertainty and change people’s outlooks about economic performance,” Stock said.
Joining Stock in his support of the bill is Harvard Economist Lawrence F. Katz.
In a New York Times editorial published two days prior to Obama’s jobs speech, Katz outlined several federal measures he believed were necessary to reinvigorate the economy, including a payroll tax credit and increased federal spending in the hundreds of billions—two defining features of the plan which Obama ultimately offered.
“These initiatives could start us down the road to a sustained jobs recovery with more broadly shared prosperity,” Katz wrote in the editorial.
However, others Harvard economists have said they are significantly less pleased with the potential stimulus package.
Last Friday, Jeffrey A. Miron, the director of undergraduate studies for Economics and a noted libertarian, criticized the “centralized top-down” strategy of the jobs proposal.
Specifically, Miron disapproved of increased spending on infrastructure as well as the proposal to allocate federal money to states and cities to support the retention and rehiring of teachers.
In another New York Times editorial, published after Obama’s speech, Economics Professor Robert J. Barro called for austerity and long-term solutions, rather than short-term stimulus.
Barro criticized Obama’s plan to reduce payroll taxes, and said that such measures have transient effects and do not result in significant hiring increases, a view shared by Miron.
“I don’t think the cost of hiring more labor has been the main negative facing employers. They’re more concerned that they don’t expect to sell a lot,” Miron said.
Miron went on to say that Obama’s proposal on Thursday was part of the administration’s misguided approach to fixing the nation’s woes.
“The focus should not be on the unemployment rate, but making the economy more efficient, more productive, like eliminating existing bad policies,” he said, citing a need to improve the tax code and cut down on excessive regulation.
“Even more broadly, the economy is more likely to start growing again if the President and Congress are clearly sympathetic to capitalism, as opposed to being sympathetic to soaking the rich.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While science departments across the University vie for state-of-the-art laboratory spaces and new equipment, renovations to the mathematics common room on the fourth floor of the Science Center will give Harvard’s math department increased access to a very different kind of technology come October: blackboards.
The renovated common room will be outfitted with overhead LCD projectors and four large blackboards—improvements that Irene Minder, director of administration and finance for the department, said will allow multiple groups of students and faculty to use the space at the same time.
“It’s more like mathematicians work together really. I’d like to have that kind of atmosphere for my students,” added Mathematics Professor Robin Gottlieb.
The renovation also calls for updating the common room kitchen and rearranging shelving in the third floor mathematics library. Students will be able to use their laptops in the library for the first time—a convenience that was previously prohibited due to a shortage of power outlets.
The Math Department—which has permanent offices on the second through fifth floors of the Science Center—has traditionally used the space at the end of their fourth floor hallway as a site for office hours, meetings, and social gatherings.
But growth in the department, which enrolls nearly 3,000 students per school year, and the desire for larger, more collaborative study spaces prompted discussion of how to revamp the common room and library, according to Minder.
“Students are our main priority and they needed space,” she said.
More space has come at a cost—three offices were demolished to accommodate the renovation—but even those professors who were displaced are content with the change. Mathematics Preceptor Oliver R. Knill, whose office was moved down the hall, said changing his furniture has actually given him more room.
Construction began this summer and was scheduled to finish in time for a department welcome celebration this Friday. Finishing touches and furniture have yet to be added, however. Although the event will occur as planned, the common room will not be officially completed until Oct. 1, assuming work continues on schedule, Minder said.
Staff members accommodated the construction during the summer, but delays have limited access to the space since the school year began.
“[It would have been] nice if they had finished over the summer,” said Math Teaching Fellow Matthew J. Woolf, adding that he and other graduate students “are somewhat skeptical” that the work will finish by the new completion date.
But overall, Woolf thinks the new space will be an asset to the department.
“It’s really not the same to go to 309 or 309a and sit in those small desks,” Gottlieb said of the classrooms frequently used for math work sessions. “Blackboards are like the lab of math. So there will be more lab space, and I think that’s a good thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many dining hall workers are celebrating Thursday’s announcement of a tentative, unanimously passed contract agreement between Harvard and UNITE HERE Local 26, the union representing dining hall staff.
The tentative contract guarantees, among other things, a 2.73 percent annual wage increase for workers and the creation of a joint committee of University staff and union members to monitor workplace conditions in dining halls and oversee the sustainable foods program.
Adams House cook Edward B. Childs, a member of the bargaining committee, said that dining hall workers are very excited about the new contract agreement.
“For this period of time, we did good,” Childs said.
He added that there were no cutbacks as part of the new contract, which was a big victory for dining hall workers.
“The number one thing is that there were not take-aways,” he said. “We didn’t lose anything.”
For many dining hall workers, the most important part of the contract is the five-year job security it offers.
“I’ve got a family, so I’m just happy to have a job,” said John S. Martin, an ID checker in Annenberg. “Of course, the wages are nice too.”
Martin added that aside from the pay raise, little about his job will change.
“Everything basically stays the same,” Martin said. “But that’s fine. We get paid good here. I think it’s fair.”
However, several dining hall workers disagreed with Martin, saying that the contract did not go far enough. The new contract will not include an option for workers to roll over or buy back unused sick days, for example.
“They just don’t want to pay us as much as they should,” said one dining hall worker who wished to remain anonymous to preserve his/her relationship with the University.
The worker added that the bargaining committee settled too easily. “I think they should have fought harder,” the worker said.
Another dining hall worker, who also wished to remain anonymous, said though she is happy with the contract, she is not sure if she feels she can trust the University.
“I think the contract is good if the University does their side,” she said. “But we do not know if they will.”
Despite these doubts, Local 26 leadership and members of the bargaining committee are fairly certain that the contract will be approved by union members when they vote on it Sept. 19.
“I think that most of the workers who know about it are excited,” Childs said. “I think there is a step in the right direction.”

Harvard School of Public Health Professor Laurie H. Glimcher ’72, who graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1976, will leave the University in January to be the next dean of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.
Glimcher, also a professor at Harvard Medical School, is currently the director of the HSPH Division of Biological Sciences.
A noted immunologist, she also runs a highly-acclaimed HMS immunology program. She has been a Harvard faculty member since 1990.
“Laurie is one of the most eminent immunologist at Harvard among a very strong group of immunologists,” said Harvard Medical School Professor and former University Provost Steven E. Hyman. “She’s smart, knowledgeable, energetic and implacable.”
Hyman noted that many institutions have eyed Glimcher for top positions in the past. “We feel honored that other institutions turn to our faculty for leadership,” Hyman said.
Glimcher has deep ties to Harvard.
“I’m 60, and I’ve basically been at Harvard since I was a teenager,” she said. “I’ve spent basically my whole life here.”
Glimcher’s father, Melvin J. Glimcher, is a professor emeritus at the Medical School. Glimcher herself received her undergraduate and graduate degrees at Harvard and completed her residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of Harvard’s teaching hospitals.
Glimcher said that her departure from an institution that has been her home for decades “feels a little strange.” But, she said, the time felt right for a move, adding that she believes she can make a larger impact in her new role as dean of Weill Cornell.
Weill Cornell, Cornell’s medical school, is located in Manhattan, unlike the university’s main campus, which is in Ithaca, New York.
Cornell President David J. Skorton announced Glimcher’s appointment last week.
She will be taking the helm as the head of the medical school after a period of declining university budgets and federal research funding.
“I’m concerned about the future of American medical centers in this time of enormously strained financial resources,” Glimcher said.
Hyman said that Glimcher faces an interesting set of challenges at Weill Cornell, pointing to the physical separation between the medical campus and the main campus as one challenge she would face. He compared Cornell’s situation to Harvard’s, noting that even the 20-minute trip between Massachusetts General Hospital and the main Cambridge campus can feel like a major separation.
Glimcher said that one of her priorities as dean of Weill Cornell will be to reduce the perceived and real separation between traditional scientific research and applied research.
“What I’d like to see is a laboratory where chemical biologists are nestled up against cardiovascular surgeons” or other therapeutic specialists, Glimcher said.
She will also be at the head of a recently-initiated curricular review at Weill Cornell. The school last overhauled its curriculum in the late 1990s.
Glimcher has strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Since 1997, she has been a board member of pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Meyers Squibb, the manufacturer of the drugs Abilify and Plavix. She also sits on the board of the Waters Corporation, which manufactures laboratory equipment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard scientists have discovered what they have dubbed an “invisible  planet.”
While the planet is not actually invisible, scientists inferred its existence from “the influence it’s exerting on another planet,” bypassing more traditional methods of detecting planets that rely on visible evidence, lead researcher Sarah A. Ballard said.
Ballard, who is a graduate student in astronomy, found the planet—dubbed Kepler-19c and located 650 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra—during a routine examination of data collected from a NASA mission.
She noticed that the orbit of a previously discovered planet, Kepler-19b, was irregular. During its orbit, the planet finished rotating its star five minutes earlier or five minutes later than expected.
She concluded that the gravity of another planet must be pulling on Kepler-19b and causing the inconsistencies in the length of the orbit.
“It’s bullying the planet that’s there,” Ballard said.
According to Ballard, the discovery of Kepler-19c has the potential to usher in a new age of discovery where scientists have the ability to find a massive number of previously unidentified planets.
“I predict there will be thousands of additional planets discovered using this method,” Ballard said. “It’s an entirely new way to find new worlds.”
Over 150 years ago the astronomer Alexis Bouvard used a similar method to identify Neptune, the most distant planet in our solar system. Bouvard deduced Neptune’s presence from unusual patterns in Uranus’s orbit. Neptune’s existence and location was later visually verified through observations from telescopes.
The transit timing variation method used to discover Kepler-19c is only a few years old. It is a modern variation on the process used to identify Neptune.
Ballard said that her discovery represents the “first robust example” of a method that had previously seemed plausible, but was still only a theory.
The discovery of Kepler-19b and Kepler 190c are a part of NASA’S Kepler mission. Launched in 2009, scientists gave the mission the task of discovering alien planets throughout the galaxy.
According to David Charbonneau, a professor of astronomy and co-author of the Ballard’s findings, the Kepler mission was initially designed to use more traditional methods of finding planets, namely detecting the shadows that they cast on stars.
This more customary method required that stars and plans align perfectly and therefore was less productive and effective, he said.
This more traditional method was employed to discover Kepler-19b–the planet that led to the eventual discovery of Kepler-19c.
The transit timing variation method, Charbonneau said, could be the future of planet discovery.
“The idea was not unexpected,” Charbonneau said. “People had for years described this idea as a theoretical construct, a way of finding planets.”
With that theory having graduated beyond theory to tried and true method, Charbonneau said, the prospect of what may still be discovered is “exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An individual effort by co-captain Melanie Baskind with only 1:20 left to play was the difference maker in Harvard’s 2-1 win over UMass (2-2-1) Friday night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
The forward received the ball in the box, where she proceeded to dribble around and past the Minutewomen defense before sending a shot to the right of the goalie and sealing the win for the Crimson (2-1).
“We knew coming into [the game] it was going to be a battle to the end,” sophomore defender Peyton Johnson said. “I don’t think we were expecting to win in the last two minutes, but [Baskind] came through with an awesome shot, and the defense held it together in the end.”
The Crimson had a one-goal advantage in the first half that was erased late in the second when Minutewoman Erin McGaffigan put away the tying penalty kick with 4:58 left on the clock.
Despite controlling the ball throughout the game, Harvard could not convert its rate of possession into goals. The Crimson still out-shot the visitors, 20-8, landing 10 attempts on target.
“We just have to continue to work and finding the seams that we’re not finding just yet,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We’re getting around the corner, but everyone is making the same run, so we have to work on that in practice.”
It had seemed early on that the Crimson might cruise to a victory, as it dominated possession from the get-go and earned a one-goal lead early in the first half.
With only 11:15 played in the period, rookie midfielder Kate Makaroff put away the ball after sophomore forward Elizabeth Weisman’s shot ricocheted off a defender’s leg. The deflection landed at the feet of Makaroff, who kept her wits about her and knocked the ball into the open net.
The offensive onslaught continued throughout the half, with Harvard getting off 12 shots compared to the Minutewomen’s three.
Freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby and Baskind were key in driving the offense up the field, with the rookie finishing the contest with a game-high six shots, three of which were on goal. Baskind and junior Alexandra Conigliaro were tied for second on the team with four shots each.
UMass started showing more life in the second half, efficiently putting together more passes and getting off five shots compared to Harvard’s eight.
McGaffigan had a good chance in the 33rd minute when teammate Moa Mattsson sent in a high cross that McGaffigan could not successfully redirect with her head. The senior finished the game with a team-high three shots.
Her most crucial shot came in the 85th minute when McGaffigan calmly took the tying penalty kick after sophomore goalkeeper Jessica Wright—who came into the game to replace a bleeding AJ Millet—tripped up an attacking UMass player in an attempt to clear the ball from the box.
“It was definitely a penalty,” Leone said. “It’s just unfortunate. It’s tough for a goalkeeper to go in cold like that—that’s really hard to do. Jess did the best she could.”
The play culminated a late Minutewomen offensive that lasted five minutes prior to the goal.
It was the second game in a row that the Crimson gave up a goal in the final 10 minutes. But it was also the second consecutive match where Harvard demonstrated its resilience to come up with a late goal.
It was also the second time that Baskind was involved in capturing the win, though this time around, she did it all herself.
The senior deftly dribbled her way past three Minutewomen defenders to face goalie Emily Cota one on one. Cota fell the wrong way as Baskind shot the ball to the right, resulting in a euphoric celebration on the sidelines.
“We came out really strong and kind of in the middle we lost our touch a little bit and our composure,” Weisman said. “The end of the half we all got fired up, and Mel put away that awesome goal; it was just unbelievable.”

The Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams kicked off their  seasons on Saturday as they traveled to Smithfield, R.I., to compete in  the Bryant Invitational. The Crimson faced stiff competition at the  invitational, including the nationally-ranked Providence College Friars  on the men’s side. Though the meet was not scored, Harvard coach Jason  Saretsky used it as a means to provide his younger runners with  experience racing at the collegiate level.
“It was our first meet of season,” Saretsky said. “We ran primarily  freshmen and sophomores. It was good for them to shake some of the rust  off and get a race under their belt.”
Freshman Ryan Meehan led the way for the men’s team with a time of  15:36.74, good for an 11th-place finish. Classmate Alaina Alvarez paced  the women’s team, covering the five-kilometer course in 18:20.06.  Alvarez’s time was good for 7th overall in the women’s race.
The Crimson placed three other runners in the top-20, as sophomores  Alaina Murphy and Morgan Kelly, along with freshman Viviana Hanley,  finished with times of 18:36.12, 18:45.17, and 18:52.44, respectively.

In one of the toughest games of the women’s soccer team’s preseason schedule, the Crimson (3-1) depended on rookie Lauren Urke and junior Alexandra Conigliaro to secure the host’s 2-1 victory over the University of Connecticut.
In a close fight until the end, Sunday’s matchup at Ohiri Field saw two firsts: a goalie sent to the hospital, and the Huskies sent back to Connecticut with a 3-3 record.
“We knew coming out that this would be a good team and that we had to bring our best,” Urke said. “An all-team effort: every single person on the field would have to play their best, and I think everyone put 100% effort out there.”
Coming into the 30th matchup between UConn and Harvard, the Huskies felt poised to continue its historical success—with 24 overall wins—against the Crimson.
But Harvard was ready this year, and with a tough freshman class and an even tougher back line, the squad left the field with its undefeated record at home intact.
“I thought we were committed to what we were trying to do which was try to keep the ball, possess the ball, and stay behind the ball because we knew that our legs were going to be tested to the max because of the game on Friday night [against University of Massachusetts],” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We held it together and held off a great team. UConn is a big time team, so it was a big win for us.”
The freshman Urke started the game on the right foot for Harvard, nailing in a goal in the first two minutes of the match, the first of her Crimson career.
Co-captain Melanie Baskind set up Urke with a smooth cross that the freshman whacked past UConn goalie Jessica Dulski.
Dulski, who in the Huskies previous four games allowed only four goals, made three saves on Sunday while giving up two goals to the Crimson.
Harvard’s lead didn’t last long as midway through the first half, the Huskies’ Riley Houle sent a long shot past the hands of Harvard goaltender Jessie Wright to tie the score at one.
Wright, who sustained a hit to the head in the early minutes of the first half, was soon pulled from the game and sent to the hospital to check for a concussion.
“We might be doing some special magic, some magic potions for them,” Leone said of his three injured goalkeepers. “They’re a team of four. We’re a big team, but we’re also a team of four and [our goalies] got to do it together. Whoever has to play will play well.“
With junior goalkeeper AJ Millet out with a broken nose from Friday’s game, and freshman goalie Bethany Kanten still suffering from an injured shoulder, freshman Cheta Emba stepped into the net, making four crucial saves against the Huskies.
“I was just trying to stay calm and bring home a win for the team, do what I could when I was called on,” the rookie said.
Emba had a near-injury moment, scaring Leone and the rest of the squad, when with 51 seconds left in the game, chaos in front of the net forced the goalie to land face-first into the ground. Although trainers were called, Emba decided to stay in for the remaining seconds.
“My favorite moment was probably seeing Cheta play out that last ball there,” Urke said. “She took it for the team, and that’s something we’ve talked about, making that sacrifice.”
Despite the goalie changes, the back end of the Crimson stayed tough, best seen when senior Lindsey Kowal quickly blocked a shot in the beginning of the second half, preventing a Huskie shot on a momentarily empty goal.
“The back four was really strong today,” Leone said. “They had so many things to deal with and all four of them played fantastic.”
Coming out of halftime with a 1-1 tie, the Crimson defensive line felt the pressure of a newly energized UConn squad.
But despite dominating possession, the Huskies couldn’t convert. Instead, ten minutes into the second half, Urke again helped Harvard take the lead.
The freshman sent a cross pass to Conigliaro—a Crimson sports comper—who headed it in for her first goal of the season.
With Conigliaro’s goal, and sophomore Peyton Johnson’s big kick in the last 10 seconds of the match, the Crimson grabbed its third victory in a row.
“This win, we said it’s a stepping stone,” Emba said. “We need to keep doing big things, keep going further to bring home the Ivy at the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a day when Crimson coach Sue Caples was honored along with her 1981 teammates at UMass, her alma mater got the better of her current team of 24 years, as Harvard (2-1) fell, 3-0, to the Minutewomen (2-3) in their home opener.
Caples, an All-American at UMass, captained the Minutewomen to the 1981 NCAA Championship game, collecting All-Tournament honors along the way. Since becoming Harvard’s head coach in 1988, the Crimson has been 5-8 against her former squad.
“It’s great seeing how what Coach Caples and her teammates accomplished 30 years ago is still reverberating today,” junior midfielder Kim Goh said. “What they did is what we want to create here, so we definitely have a lot of respect for them.”
The ceremony aside, Caples tried to ensure that her players focus remained on the task at hand.
“She’s very adamant that our pregame is as focused as possible,” Goh said. “She really tried to keep it the same as every game.”
UMass did not wait around before trying to emulate Caples and her former teammates, going up, 2-0, in the first 16 minutes of regulation on goals from junior forwards Kim Young and Nicole Cordero.
Young’s effort was unassisted while Cordero scored off a long lead pass from sophomore teammate Alyssa Ineson.
It was the second goal of the season for both Young and Cordero.
Senior midfielder Nikki Panciocco added a third goal early in the second half to seal the deal.
A stifling defensive effort by the Minutewomen limited Harvard to only two shots on goal.
“They were a very strong, physical team,” junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “They were able to get to the ball before us and they really stepped up to defend and prevent our shots from getting off.”
Despite the loss, Tassopoulos continued her stellar play in this young season, recording 13 saves to give her 26 on the year.
She currently has a save percentage of .839, compared to her .725 mark from last season.
“If there is any reason for my improved play I would have to say it is my team mates,” Tassopoulos said. “We have got a lot of good freshmen who have really integrated into the team, and we are just challenging and pushing each other every day at practice.”
Sophomore Carly McNeill also added a defensive save, just the second of her young career.
“They really had a technically sound, mistake free team,” Goh said. “After last weekend we came in with some confidence, and they just did not let up and would not let us have that many opportunities.”
Though the shot disparity would make it seem that the game was played primarily on the Crimson’s side of the field, much of the game was spent maneuvering in the midfield.
While it was a relatively even fight, Harvard suffered in the transition from winning a ball in the midfield to creating sufficient shot opportunities.
“Our structure is not quite where it should be,” Tassopoulos said. “But it is still early in the season and it is definitely something we are working on to improve.”
The loss is the first for the Crimson this year, moving its record on the road to 1-1.
Harvard will try to maintain the momentum from its first two games when the season begins in earnest next weekend with a Saturday game at Yale to open Ivy League play, before taking on Quinnipiac the day after.
“It is time to refocus and leave what happened at UMass behind,” Tassopoulos added. “We need to be ready to enter the Ivy League schedule strong, and try and get a win against Yale.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like any sports team, a machine is greater than the sum of its parts. When there is a kink in the machinery, it can fall apart or stop working all together.
Similarly, when senior co-captain Luka Babic, a central piece to the Harvard men’s water polo team, was hospitalized for a brutal hit to the face in the fourth period of the Crimson’s Saturday morning game against George Washington, the team began to break down as its weekend at the Princeton Invitational progressed.
Babic was guarding two-meters when a backhand shot from the Colonials’ set struck him in the eye. He was taken out of the game and taken to the hospital afterward, where he received a total of 15 stitches above and below his eye.
“He’s a key component in our offense and it affected us more than we were expecting … playing without his intensity and his leadership,” freshman utility Max Murphy said.
Babic is recovering well and will likely return to the pool by next week, but Harvard’s fallout from his injury was not nearly as secure.
The Crimson (3-3) continued on to beat George Washington (3-5), 14-13, in double overtime but later lost to No. 17 Princeton (5-0) and Johns Hopkins (7-1) in its second and third games, respectively. Not until the third quarter of the invitational’s finale against Fordham did the Crimson finally regain its footing. Harvard claimed a comeback 8-6 victory over Fordham and split the Princeton Invitational, 2-2.
HARVARD 8, FORDHAM 6
Coming off of two significant losses to Johns Hopkins and the Tigers, the Crimson struggled to boost morale in the first half of its contest against the Rams, who came out strong to lead by two goals at the half.
After settling down at halftime, the Crimson knotted the score at five in third period before dominating the fourth with a 3-1 run to win.
“Everyone was exhausted at the end of two days and four games, but we switched up the line up, [which] helped keep the intensity and the excitement,” said Murphy, who led the team with three goals in his first starting game of his college career.
JOHNS HOPKINS 14, HARVARD 6
As was the trend for the weekend, Harvard got off to a slow start Sunday morning, letting the Blue Jays spring out to 5-0 lead in the first half.
“We didn’t play a solid defense,” head coach Ted Minnis said of the team’s performance in the second half. “We played a lot of man down, and they scored on that.”
While the Crimson was able to keep pace with Johns Hopkins for the remainder of the game, it was never able to close the scoring gap to less than four goals.
PRINCETON 13, HARVARD 2
Like the Johns Hopkins game, Harvard was late to put numbers on the board, waiting more than three quarters and 12 Princeton goals before putting the ball in the Tigers’ net Saturday afternoon. The match proved to be the Crimson’s most dismal performance of the weekend.
“We didn’t even get a shot off in the first quarter,” Minnis said. “They got momentum on us, and then their speed took over.”
Like the Blue Jays, Princeton demonstrated a strong defense and proved to be a very tough opponent.
“They’re very similar teams in the way they do things,” Minnis said. “They both get after it on the transitions. They’re both definitely what we are aspiring to be.”
HARVARD 14, GEORGE WASHINGTON 13
On the opening day of the two-day tournament, the Crimson took George Washington into double overtime in the morning, only to squeak out a 14-13 win.
Harvard was up 9-3 with less than three minutes in the third stanza against the Colonials. George Washington’s powerful 8-2 rally allowed them to knot the score at 11 in the final two minutes of the game. Fortunately for the Crimson, it outscored the Colonials by one goal in the second overtime.
“We established dominance early on in the game, and we relaxed too much,” Murphy said. “They came back while we were being complacent. We pulled out with the win, but at least, this weekend we learned to keep focus and intensity all four quarters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams kicked off their seasons on Saturday as the two squads traveled to Smithfield, R.I., to compete in the 5k course at the Bryant Invitational. The Crimson faced stiff competition, including the nationally-ranked Providence College Friars on the men’s side. Though the meet was not scored, Harvard coach Jason Saretsky used it as an means to provide his younger runners with experience racing at the collegiate level.
“It was our first meet of the season,” Saretsky said. “We ran primarily freshman and sophomores. It was good for them to shake some of the rust off and get a race under their belts.”
One rookie who stood out on Saturday was freshman Ryan Meehan. Running his first race in a Crimson uniform, Meehan led the way for the men’s team, clocking in a time of 15:36.74 for an 11th-place finish.
“I just wanted to go out there and see what I could do at this level,” Meehan said. “I wanted to put myself in a good position, to start with the leaders and try to hang on as long as I could. I think it worked out, because I stayed in that pack for pretty much the entire race.”
Meehan was able to pull off a strong performance in spite of the tricky conditions at the Bryant Invite. The thickness of the grass along the course created problems for the Harvard squad and added difficulty to a seemingly fast course.
“The footing in the grass was a little strange,” Meehan said. “If you looked at how flat it was, you would expect to see some really fast times. I think the grass definitely slowed it down a bit.”
Behind Meehan for the Crimson were sophomore Erik Kraus and freshman Will Geiken. The pair also ran sub-16-minute races, finishing in 17th place and 20th place with times of 15:52.52 and 15:55.77, respectively.
Freshman Alaina Alvarez paced the women’s team, crossing the finish line in 18:20.06. Alvarez’s time was good for seventh overall in the women’s race. Making her collegiate debut, the Dana Point, Calif., native found a way to shake off some pre-race nerves.
“I was a little nervous because I hadn’t raced in quite a while,” Alvarez said. “But I was excited to race for new team and race against new competition. My goal was to be first for Harvard, so I just ran from the gun and tried to stay with the front pack.”
On the women’s side, Harvard was able to place four runners in the top 20, as sophomores Alaina Murphy and Morgan Kelly, along with freshman Viviana Hanley, finished with times of 18:36.12, 18:45.17, and 18:52.44, respectively.
Some familiar faces were cheering for the Crimson runners as they sped their way through the course. Senior captains Michael Hoffman and Kirsten Jorgensen made the trip with their teammates, though the veteran pair won’t make their 2011 cross country debut until next weekend.
“It was really helpful to have someone there who is older and has more experience. [Jorgenson] helped us settle into our routines with warming up and cooling down.”
Straying from the typical eight-kilometer men’s race and six-kilometer women’s race, Saturday’s meet featured a pair of five-kilometer races. Saretsky indicated that this irregularity was a major reason for the Crimson’s participation at the meet, as it allowed the squad’s first-years to run the same distance that they did in high school.
“[The Bryant Invitational] was a good opportunity for our team’s freshmen to get our feet wet and get ready for our meet next weekend,” Alvarez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the start of every school year, there is always a point after catching up with friends and turning in a study card when one realizes that it’s now time to get back to work.
As the season’s opening victory over Northeastern fades into memory, a pair of losses for the Harvard men’s soccer team this weekend served as a similar reminder that there is still a whole season ahead and a lot of work to be done.
The Crimson (1-2) dropped its matchup Friday night, 2-0, to No. 25 St. John’s (3-1) before falling to Rhode Island (2-4), 2-1, in Sunday afternoon’s contest at Ohiri Field.
“I think we played good soccer this weekend,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “We moved the ball quickly, and we attacked and pressured well … Going forward, I think our biggest challenges are in front of both goals, in terms of defensive accountability in the final third and improving finishing quality. I know that we recognize our mistakes and that we can fix them.”
RHODE ISLAND 2, HARVARD 1
Possession is important, but at the end of the day what really matters is who can persevere and capitalize on chances to put away the ball.
Facing a 1-0 deficit at halftime, Harvard battled back to even the score in the 72nd minute, but a well-placed header six minutes later sealed the win for the Rams.
The Crimson evened the score when freshman midfielder Tim Schmoll threaded a pass through the Rhode Island defense. Junior Brian Rogers muscled his way behind the line, capitalizing on a hesitation by a Rams defender, to place the ball far-post and even the score at 71:14.
With the intensity and physicality of the game increasing, Rhode Island responded six minutes later, putting another goal on the scoreboard when freshman midfielder Matt Sykes sent a ball in from the left side to rookie forward Ross Morison, who headed the ball back across the goal into the upper-left hand corner for the game-winning tally.
Both teams had battled for possession at the beginning of the match, with the Harvard offense having the edge in shots. But the Rams were first to put the ball in the back of the net when Morison took advantage of an errant drop kick. The forward then beat Crimson keeper Brett Conrad on a one-on-one for the goal at the 20th minute.
Harvard outshot Rhode Island, 20-7, and outnumbered the squad in corners, 6-1, yet the Crimson was unable to capitalize on its possession in the final third.
“This game obviously was a really tough loss for us,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “I think if we played them 10 more times, we would probably win nine out of 10. It ultimately comes down to whoever scores the most goals. We feel that there will be a lot that we can learn from both games this weekend, and right now, we are trying to stay positive.”
ST. JOHN’S 2, HARVARD 0
The road wasn’t friendly to the Harvard men’s soccer team Friday night, with the Crimson dropping its first away game of the season to No. 25 St. John’s, 2-0.
Playing at Belson Stadium in Queens, N.Y., the Red Storm (3-1) came out strong on the offensive, putting Harvard (1-1) immediately under pressure. After the 17th minute, St. John’s took five corner kicks in nearly the same number of minutes, with junior midfielder Ido Ligety ultimately converting on a header to give the Red Storm the lead. The St. John’s defense limited the Crimson to one shot in the first half, ending the period with the 1-0 edge.
The Red Storm showed no signs of letting up, continuing to challenge the Harvard defense in the second half. Less than six minutes into the period, senior forward Walter Hines tallied another point for St. John’s with a chip shot from 12 yards out off an assist by freshman midfielder Daniel Herrera. Although the Red Storm had seven corners in the latter half to the Crimson’s one, the Harvard defense stayed strong to keep the final score at 2-0.
St. John’s outshot the Crimson, 14-3, with senior goalkeeper Austin Harms recording five saves for Harvard.
“St. John’s is extremely good, especially at home,” Junot said. “[It is] a legitimate top team this year if they stay healthy. I thought we matched St. John’s’ possession, but they created more goal-scoring opportunities.
“Do we want possession? Yes. But we want possession with goal-scoring opportunities coming from it, and this is a focus for our team going forward,” Junot said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Sunday afternoon’s 2-1 loss to Rhode Island, the Harvard men’s soccer team proved unable to recover from its self-inflected wounds in spite of its hard-pressing offense and numerous scoring opportunities.  With the loss, the Crimson drops to 1-2 this season.
After a botched drop-kick clearance by junior goalkeeper Brett Conrad that was intercepted and put away by Rhode Island forward Ross Morison, Harvard found itself in a 1-0 hole midway through the first half.
But rather than allowing the early goal to demoralize the team, the Crimson seized control of the game by maintaining possession of the ball for most of the first half and outshooting its opponents by almost a 3-1 margin by halftime.
Midway through the second half, the Crimson were able to draw level with the Rams, thanks to a goal by junior forward Brian Rogers to the lower left corner of the post.
But the home side’s comeback was short-lived, as another defensive lapse by the Harvard backline gave Rhode Island a free header on goal and ultimately the match.
“Obviously, the first goal was a mistake on our goalkeeper’s part,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “In some ways it’s pretty forgivable for me since it was his first minutes [of the season] and it was just nervousness; he didnt kick the ball right. There isn’t anything you can really do with that.”
“The second goal was disappointing in terms of our mentality. The ball came across the goal twice, and in both instances, our left-side defenders just simply let [Rhode Island’s] attacking players run freely and win headers.”
SHOTS, SHOTS, AND MORE SHOTS
Although Sunday’s highly physical game ended in frustration for Harvard, with the Rams just edging out the home side by a goal, the final result does not fully capture the tremendous offensive effort by the Crimson front line. Throughout much of the game, Harvard dictated the pace of play, dominating not only ball possession but also recording a staggering number of shots. For the day, the Crimson outshot the Rams, 20-7, and notched six corner kicks to Rhode Island’s one.
Harvard’s offensive dominance against the Rams was also matched with a improved playing style that not only made use of ball possession and one-two interchanges but also on playing the ball into empty spaces rather than to the feet of an open player.
“Performance-wise, I’m happy to see the improvement in our playing style,” Junot said. “In every single game, we’ve moved the ball pretty well and attack open spaces. That’s distinctly team-style soccer and different from last year for us.”
The overall result was an attractive brand of soccer by the Crimson that was not only effective from a tactical standpoint, but also entertaining.
Despite Harvard’s adept ball movement and numerous shots on goal, it was unable to capitalize on any of its chances.
“We think that our quality in the final third of the field needs to improve,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “Obviously, we are going to need to work on that if we want to put some goals in the net.”
STANDOUT PERFORMANCES
While much talk coming into this latest season for the Harvard men’s soccer team surrounded the sole responsibility that Rogers would have to shoulder as the team’s primary goal scorer and playmaker, no one quite expected the emergence of an additional playmaker for the Crimson.
Freshman Hiroki Kobayashi emerged as a playmaker for the Crimson by delivering dangerous crosses into the penalty box from his position on the right flank of the Harvard front line. Though against Rhode Island Rogers still remained the engine of the Harvard offense, totaling seven shots and scoring the home side’s only goal, Kobayashi was efficient on the right wing.
“The reason why we played [Kobayashi] wide was because he can serve a really good ball crossing-wise,” Junot said. “He did that well this game and probably created three goal scoring opportunities for us with his service.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard, Yale, and Princeton last met on the links earlier this year for the Ivy League Championships, the Bulldogs cruised to a commanding victory, while the Tigers edged out the Crimson for fifth place. This past weekend’s match-play affair at the Sebonack Golf Club in Long Island, N.Y., told a different story: one in which Harvard was fighting for first, rather than lagging behind. Yale still won the overall event, as it won seven of 18 total matches, but this time it topped a refueled Crimson squad by only one match, 7.5-6.5. This time it was Princeton’s turn to bring up the rear.
“Our goal is to win, and we’re disappointed that we didn’t win,” Crimson senior Mark Pollak said.
Pollak, playing at No. 2, was the only Harvard golfer to win both of his matches.
“Picking up two wins was huge,” captain Tony Grillo said of Pollak. “He won one on the 16th hole and one on the 17th.”
Most golf matches follow the stroke-play format—in which players compete for the best cumulative score—but this past weekend’s tournament consisted of match play, in which points are awarded for winning individual holes.
Although many of the day’s matches were decided before the final hole, Crimson sophomore Seiji Liu’s match came down to the wire. Liu, playing at No. 5, halved his match against his Bulldog competitor; the pair beat the Tigers’ fifth-ranked golfer.
“We kept trading one up, one down,” Liu said. “It came down to the 18th hole. I was one up on Yale, but he made a lengthy putt ... to tie the match.”
According to Liu, the match-tying putt was one of many that the Yale golfer made over the course of the day.
“We both played extremely good golf,” Liu said. “It was just a testament to how Ivy League golf is improving. We’re just going to have to put in hard work and practice to reach our goals.”
Harvard junior Theo Lederhausen, playing at the No. 1 spot, and Crimson sophomore Kevin McCarthy, playing at the No. 6 spot, both defeated their opponents from Princeton, 1-up and 4 and 3, respectively, and lost to their opponents from Yale, 3 and 2 and 2-up, respectively.
Meanwhile, freshman Akash Mirchandani bested his competitor from Yale, 2 and 1, but fell to his opponent from Princeton, 5 and 4. The Tigers took only two of six matches from Harvard all day.
“I played pretty well, except for a few holes on the front side,” Mirchandani said. “The guy from Princeton was playing very well. He didn’t miss. I can’t complain too much. He was just on fire. I didn’t give it to him, but he won the match.”
Crimson captain Tony Grillo, playing at the No. 3 spot, lost both of his matches.
This was the second straight year when the squads have elected to open their fall seasons with a trip to Southampton, N.Y. Sebonack, which was designed by Jack Nicklaus and Tom Doak, sits in a golf-rich area of Long Island along with the National Golf Links of America and the Shinnecock Hills Golf Course. Grillo noted that the team looks forward to the trip to the course, which was only built in 2006.
“It’s a fun tournament for us,” he said. “It’s a very good first tournament of the year.”
Grillo added that Sebonack, selected to host the 2013 U.S. Women’s Open, is a more challenging course than some of the others that the team plays over the course of the year.
While a win would certainly have given a confidence boost to a Harvard team looking to move its way up the Ivy rankings, there were plenty of positives from the outing, including the performances of Mirchandani and McCarthy, who both managed to defeat opponents in their first college tournaments. The Crimson heads back to Long Island this coming weekend to compete in The McLaughlin on the Red Course at Bethpage in Farmingdale, N.Y.

For the second year in a row, Cambridge University beat Harvard for the top spot on Quacquarelli Symonds's eighth annual World University Rankings. MIT, Yale, and Oxford round out the top five, respectively.
Head of Research for QS Ben Sowter explained the ranking to The Gaurdian. "The gap between Cambridge and Harvard is very small, but Cambridge's superior student/faculty ratio helped tip the balance," he said. "Individual attention is one of the key attractions of the Oxbridge tutorial system."
Abi K. Fiedler '15, who hails from Essex, England, applied to Oxford rather than Cambridge, but is nonetheless familiar with its curriculum and teaching. She was unfazed by Sowter's explanation.
"Here, I feel like we have plenty of advising," she said. "Even if the ratio isn't as good within departments, there is plenty of help."
QS used global surveys to rank the world's top 400 universities based on academic reputation, employer reputation, citations per faculty, the student/faculty ratio, and the proportions of international students and faculty.
Though Cambridge placed first overall, Harvard boasts the number one faculty for Arts and Humanities, Life Sciences and Medicine, and Social Sciences and Management, while Cambridge only claims a number one ranked faculty in Natural Sciences. Harvard also ranked first for academic reputation and employer reputation.
Londoner Lillie M. Beard '15 said that universities in America and the United Kingdom are difficult to compare, particularly in a quantitative way. "I think the reputation of a university is worth much more than a ranking," she said. "Unless the university I'm going to is number one, I don't really pay attention to it."
QS previously partnered with Times Higher Education, a London-based magazine, to determine its ratings. In 2009, THE separated from QS to develop their own ranking method, which they claimed would evaluate universities quantifiably, rather than through subjective surveys. THE partnered with Thomas Reuters and published its first rankings in 2010, with Harvard placing first and Cambridge, sixth. THE will publish its second annual World University Rankings on October 6, 2011.

Harvard seems to have a blog for everything: first and foremost Flyby for news on the go, Harvard FML for complaining about life, books&liquor for proof that fashion really can be found on campus, isawyouharvard for general creepiness, and more. This summer, however, three juniors created a new blog called ivyfed, which addresses "eating, dressing, and living well," according to their website.
"[Ivyfed] fills in the blanks for Harvard media and culture," said Georgia V. Stasinopoulos '13, one of the three bloggers.
Ivyfed was started this summer by Stasinopoulos, Jasmine Y. Miller '13, and Abby P. Sun '13, who have been roommates since freshman year. The three juniors hope ivyfed will answer similar questions to those one might pose to a friend or roommate.
"We want to be everyone's cool older friend," Miller said.
Ivyfed's simple and aesthetically pleasing website features three sections, ivyfed, ivycovered, and ivyseen, which discuss dining, fashion, and lifestyle at Harvard. The website has already had 1,400 unique hits and has an average of 50 to 60 visitors per day, according to Stasinopoulos.
"We're looking to get in touch with undergrads on campus, but anyone who lives in the Harvard area benefits from the stuff we blog about,"Stansinopoulos added.
If you're in need of some advice about clothes, dining hall food, or dating, be sure to check out their website. As a bonus, you can like their Facebook page for the chance to win a homemade cake baked by Stasinopoulos, Miller, and Sun.
