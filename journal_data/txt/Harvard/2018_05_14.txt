After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hulu’s Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning success of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” has demonstrated the market for screen adaptations of dystopian fiction in the Trump era. From director Ramin Bahrani, the latest installment is an HBO-produced adaptation of “Fahrenheit 451,” from the original 1953 novel by Ray Bradbury. In dystopian future Cleveland, Guy Montag (Michael B. Jordan) leads a squadron of so-called “firefighters,” whose job is counterintuitively not to fight fires, but to start them, stifling the dissemination of knowledge by the “Eels,” a rebel group using new technology to preserve works of literature and art. Montag shares a father-son relationship with his propaganda-spewing superior, Captain Beatty (a predictably creepy Michael Shannon), who spends his free time writing fortune cookie maxims on rolling paper—the only writing platform available in a nearly paperless world—in the dark of night. After witnessing a self-immolation, Montag begins to question his loyalty to the cause, turning to rebellious Clarisse (Sofia Boutella) for reading comprehension lessons and—surprise, surprise—a secret and short-lived love affair.
Bahrani’s adaptation of “Fahrenheit 451” butchers Bradbury’s original text, repurposing a nuanced classic for an easily-digestible work of Trump-era sci-fi. He disrupts its logic with confusing extraneous detail, muddies its characters with ambiguous backstories, and oversimplifies its careful and exacting attention to the literature it references, with poor race and gender representation to boot. During a time when the freedom of speech and the importance of facts are being threatened, it’s a shame that Bahrani delivers a watered-down version of a complex novel that demands so much more.
When Guy’s firefighter unit encounters a group of Eels, the history and inception of “Fahrenheit 451”’s society unveils itself in an unsatisfying explanation that somehow convinces its indoctrinated citizens, but that unintentionally codes as insensitive and tone-deaf. According to Beatty, the dystopian regime started burning books because everyone had “too many opinions.” As a result, they started burning the more “controversial” books: Black people were offended by Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”; in response, white people naturally sought to purge America of Richard Wright’s “Native Son”; and of course, let’s not forget the feminists who wanted to do away with Hemingway, his misogyny too offensive for their sensitive proclivities. Throw in a too-quickly mentioned second civil war that reportedly killed eight million, and ta-da! Bahrani’s world-building is careless, oversimplifying the motivations of both the marginalized and privileged of what we can assume are the people of today, whose grandchildren are the inhabitants of the Cleveland depicted in the film. Even the geography makes no sense: Do we really need to fly over an ocean to get to Canada, the new free world?
Bahrani, who also penned the film’s screenplay, also takes every available chance to make an unsubtle play on the cultural zeitgeist, making for an overload of unmerited, heavy-handed allusions. The screenplay version of “Fahrenheit 451” throws modern references around like confetti: Firefighters en route to crime scenes shout the syntactically familiar slogan, “Time to burn for America again!” Massive Jumbotron-esque billboards read, “If you see something, say something,” alongside live broadcasts akin to Periscope or Instagram Live streams of the firefighters heroically performing their duties. Clarisse, in a criminally shallow summary of the newly-inserted Second Civil War, references a “tech company that predicts our thoughts,” a vague stand-in for “evil” corporate tech, like Facebook or Google. But what commentary, if at all, do these dystopian equivalents make about their contemporary predecessors? And what’s the significance of each one, both in their world and in ours? “Fahrenheit 451” attempts to be a “Black Mirror” episode that tackles every polemic at once—and in doing so, effectively becomes nothing at all.
Clearly the film’s moral is “protect books and literacy,” but in its execution, it treats the literary canon as a monolith: Mao Zedong is equally relevant to Toni Morrison, who is equally relevant to Hemingway. Viewers get the sense that Bahrani is merely name-dropping literary figures, and has not so much as Googled these texts, much less read any of them. “Fahrenheit 451” has admirable intentions, but its references merely parasitize the books its source text lauds, mining their pages for aphorisms instead of paying tribute. Not reading is one transgression, but surely appropriating relevant lines from great works of literature as pithy truisms for its own artistic purposes is quite another—likely one that Bradbury would have objected to, and even intended to combat with the original book.
The illogic and reductive typification even permeates into the characters themselves, their consistent lack of nuance reducing Bradbury’s originally rich characters into movie tropes with questionable purposes and motivations, the actors behind them doing little to elevate their roles. Clarisse is the stereotypical Manic Pixie Dream Girl, her messy bleach blonde hair and mystifying gaze ensnaring Guy into her Eel world; Boutella predictably plays the role, barely emoting and inevitably charming in a forced way. Guy, initially everyone’s favorite firefighter—“I am a hero,” he even boasts at the start of the film—is unconvincingly rehabilitated thanks to a few flashbacks of a father whose relevance is never explained and incomprehensibly turns away from his successful life by his own Commander Beatty; Jordan tries too hard in his grimaces, in the strained tears in his eyes, that too tightly clenched jaw of his—that is, when he tries at all. Beatty too is an unfortunately one-dimensional character, Shannon’s performance evoking the ghost villains of his filmography’s past—from Richard Strickland in the “Shape of Water” to General Zod in “Man of Steel.”
Unfortunately, this one-dimensionality sullies more than just the main characters, extending to the minor characters whose somewhat impressively widespread representation—one of the film’s few redeeming qualities—is reduced to the stereotypes Bahrani makes of them. By typecasting them—a random black woman codes for Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” a young black girl represents half of Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” and Mao Zedong is embodied in the only Asian character in the movie—Bahrani essentially reduces them to their race, tokenizing them in a way that undermines what their characters’ representation could have been—a general step in the right direction for the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in Hollywood films. Bahrani’s poorly worded dialogue does little to alleviate the mess he makes: Beatty drops the n-word for absolutely no reason, ironically right after explaining why the people of generations past took issue with “Huck Finn.” Additionally, Beatty’s father/mentor relationship with Guy not so subtly echoes a master/slave dynamic that—likely unintentionally—problematizes the duo’s brotherhood-turned-antagonism: Beatty takes credit for having raised Guy, ignoring his father who clearly meant something to him, and makes sure he knows that “everyone has a master.” “We are not born equal, so we must be made equal by the fire,” he says in yet another aphorism that alludes to his own hypocrisy.
Indeed, it makes no sense that Commander Beatty weaponizes literary allusions against Montag, then punishes him for the same offense; surely if Beatty throws around Kafka and Nietzsche, he too is committing treason? The inconsistency is never addressed, and neither are the remaining directorial gaffes that cheapen the original narrative in an adaptation too cool to appropriately represent Bradbury’s scorching “Fahrenheit 451.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The third time really is the charm.
After losing the Ivy League Championship Series in 2016 and 2017 against Princeton, maybe all Harvard softball needed was a change in scenery. The Crimson traveled to Hanover, N.H., where it bested Dartmouth in two games to advance to the NCAA Regionals. The Ivy League title is Harvard’s seventh all time, which is the second most in the Ancient Eight behind Princeton with 19.
Once it wrapped up its regular season with a series loss to Brown, the Crimson had to wait nearly two weeks before beginning the championship series. Rust was likely to come into play, and that it did for part of the opener. The Big Green appeared to be cruising to a 1-0 series lead on Saturday afternoon, but then the seventh inning happened. All at once, Harvard shook off its rust and hung five runs on the scoreboard—all of which scored with two outs—to come from behind and take its first lead of the game.
The Crimson hung on to win game one, 6-4, and coasted to a 4-1 victory in the second half of Saturday’s doubleheader. After another brief respite, Harvard will play seven-seed Georgia on its home turf in Athens, Ga., on Friday afternoon.
“To be able to travel somewhere else that we most likely haven’t played at is just really huge,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “And being able to compete against teams that are really good and have a chance to go to the World Series, it’s honestly great and I think it’s going to be a great experience for all of us. Being able to extend our season with the seniors is also a really great thing to come from this.”
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 1
The second game of Saturday’s doubleheader was much less pressure-packed than the first. Junior right-hander Sarah Smith went the distance in the circle, allowing just five hits and one run while punching out four. She was twirling a shutout through the first six innings, and ultimately Dartmouth could not replicate Harvard’s success in its last ups, only pushing across one run.
“Dartmouth has a great offense, and for her to completely shut them down, it made it a lot easier on the offense to just be able to come out and produce runs without having that pressure,” Rich said.
The situation in the bottom of the seventh was not as devoid of pressure as the rest of the game had been, however. After inducing two groundouts to start the inning, Smith hit consecutive batters and allowed a single to make it a 4-1 ballgame with runners on the corners.
Center fielder Tiffany Dyson strode to the plate representing the tying run. Smith got her in an 0-2 hole quickly and delivered a pitch on the outer half of the plate. Dyson popped it up, and junior second baseman Meagan Lantz camped under it to put the finishing touch on the Crimson’s championship series victory. After securing the catch, Lantz spiked the ball on the infield, and Harvard’s entire team spilled out of the dugout and congregated near the mound, celebrating its title and the continuation of its season.
“It was just disbelief that we had actually done it,” Rich said. “Honestly it took me a while for it to settle in that we actually did it, but everyone was just screaming. It was a lot of tears and happiness. All of us came together, and it was a lot of joy.”
The Crimson jumped out to a 2-0 lead by the end of the first inning and never looked back. Rich and co-captain Maddy Kaplan led off with a pair of singles to set up a runners on the corners situation. After a groundout pushed Kaplan up to second, junior third baseman Erin Lockhart laced a single to left center to score both runners.
Harvard added to its lead with a run in each of the third and fourth innings. In the third, Lockhart drove in another run with a single to shortstop, and in the next frame a Lindey Kneib double and and Elizabeth Shively single produced the Crimson’s fourth and final tally.
HARVARD 6, DARTMOUTH 4
Close calls and a wild seventh-inning comeback defined Harvard’s victory in the opener. Despite protest from the home crowd, the Crimson found itself on the right side of three borderline calls, at least two of which appeared to be the right decisions upon further review. Both of these occurred in the hectic top of the seventh.
The first could have been the final out of the game and would have given the Big Green a 4-3 win. After Lantz launched a two-run homer over the center field fence to bring the score within one, Lockhart ripped a line drive single up the middle. This brought sophomore first baseman Olivia Giaquinto to the plate, and she bounced a ball to short. Dartmouth shortstop Calista Almer threw on to first, but the toss was high and just barely pulled Tatyanah Castillo off the bag. Giaquinto was safe, and the inning would continue.
Coach Jenny Allard replaced Giaquinto with the speedy Dallas Hogan, and Shively dug in to the batter’s box. Shively worked the count full before flicking an outside pitch down the right field line, narrowly landing it in fair territory. The relay home was on target and appeared to beat the runner to the plate, but Hogan slid in under the tag with the go-ahead run. In all, Harvard plated five runs on four hits to keep its hopes alive.
“After [Lantz’s home run] it was just about each girl getting on base and doing what they could to keep extending the inning,” Rich said. “I think all of us just knew in our hearts that it was something that we could accomplish, given all that we have done this season. We have a really good history of bringing our best stuff against Dartmouth, and we definitely brought our best stuff and we saved it for the last inning to make it exciting.”
In the fourth inning, a close call went the Crimson’s way when it possibly should not have. Big Green hurler Breanna Ethridge left a pitch up and in, and it was called a hit by pitch. However, it appeared to strike the knob of Lockhart’s bat instead of her hand. Lockhart took advantage of the situation, as she stole second and came around to score Harvard’s first run of the game on a Shively single.
Ethridge was dominant throughout her start, but especially in the early going. In the first three frames, the senior allowed just two baserunners, none of whom reached on a hit, while striking out four.
Harvard’s pitching kept the team in the game from the first pitch to the last. Junior southpaw Katie Duncan went six strong innings before turning the ball over to Smith, who struck out two batters in the bottom of the seventh to record the save.
Lantz, Shively, and Kneib all had multi-hit games, and they drove in all six of the Crimson’s runs.
