As an album, “Pool” is aptly named; it echoes its subject from many perspectives, capturing in its emotional range not only the empty scintillation of the nighttime pool rager but also its converse: The quiet, inescapable desolation that comes only from sitting alone in a pool lounger during the dead, flat heat of summer. Porches’ sophomore effort is both danceable and dispirited, managing to lodge itself into that oft-reached for intersection between fun and weariness.
In “Pool,” Porches move squarely into synth-pop territory, abandoning many of the indie-rock trappings of their 2013 debut, “Slow Dance in the Cosmos.” The soundscapes of “Pool” are, as a rule, much less reliant on bass licks and guitar riffs than are those of “Slow Dance,” showcasing frontman and founder Aaron Maine’s expanded repertoire of auditory tools. However, it doesn’t yet feel as though his evident proficiency has matured into mastery. Maine’s musical tableaux, while thoughtfully constructed and fairly catchy, don’t carry the the same imprint of painstaking perfection and meticulous care that characterizes many rising stars of the up-and-coming atmospheric synth-pop genre: Tame Impala, in particular, comes to mind as the standard-bearer for this style of music. From the odd, asymmetrical synth crescendos and decrescendos of “Shape” to the slight atonality of “Be Apart,” Maine’s mixes all carry slight imperfections—musical oddities that induce in the listener a slight yet persistent sense of disharmony and unease.
That may be exactly the point. There’s a certain intentionality to the distinct tension present in “Pool.” While the album’s soundscapes are undeniably atmospheric in nature, their marked imperfections prevent the listener’s total immersion. The LP’s sound, while still being eminently listenable (even danceable), has a certain distorted analog flatness to it that forces the listener to take notice of the music. Maine’s highly versatile tenor sometimes adds to this effect, providing an anchor on distortion-heavy songs like “Shape,” but also often performs the opposite function on his more conventional mixes: His quasi-falsetto, alternatingly raw and autotuned warble on album opener, “Underwater,” is the song’s most distinctive and unsettling sonic ingredient.
Porches’ juxtaposition of uncomfortable pseudo-tension with upbeat, poppy tunes is echoed in the content of the songs themselves, which deal with themes of internal unease hidden amid bright, fun exteriors. The refrain of the song “Be Apart,” for instance, features Maine, backed by crooning collaborator Frankie Cosmos, yearning soulfully to be “a part of it all”: However, the song’s title implies that there’s more than one reading to this particular lyric. And on “Glow,” Maine decries his inability to actually resolve his issues: “I guess all that I can do / is try to stop thinking about you.”
On the whole, the album’s quality is quite high. There are a couple of numbers that feel a bit samey, “Glow” and “Mood” in particular. But that’s not to say that the album is lacking in standouts. “Car” is one, featuring a rolling, rock-inspired bass line blended into tonally flat, doppler effect-esque synth wails and guitar-ish electronic sounds that echo the quick back-and-forth of sirens.  The song is a plaintive paean that uses the image of the car to discuss autonomy and originality; in it, Maine croons, “It tells me just how / I should really feel / Oh what a machine.” “Hour” is another winner, with its ragged drumline and industrial vibe, mixed with what sound like synthesized church bells. In it, Maine, backed by the choral harmonies of Frankie Cosmos, warbles “So in my stoner hour / Oh, how I float / Just wondering about her.”
“Pool” is a mindfully executed, poppy meditation on emptiness and appearance, its themes granting a veneer of intentionality to its at-times imprecise soundscapes. Its tracks are upbeat, danceable, and thoroughly unsettling. Porches is a young band worth keeping an eye on—especially now that “Pool” is open for business.

In the age of stories like “My Week with Marilyn” and “The End of the Tour,” works that focus on the collision between cultural icons and young, aimless men might seem contrived and overused. W.B. Belcher’s novel “Lay Down Your Weary Tune” proves otherwise by redeeming the genre. While the setup initially appears similar to other plots in the genre, Belcher quickly swerves off the expected path to produce a surprising story that touches upon universal topics in life. Through careful character studies and an engaging, philosophical plot, Belcher’s debut is a meditative piece of fiction that evokes timeless ideas and emotions.
“Lay Down Your Weary Tune” fills its pages with characters and a story that epitomize its themes of the tragic consequences of past mistakes and the tradition of American myth-making. The protagonist and narrator, Jack Wyeth, is a college drop-out and would-be writer recuperating from an engagement that ended violently. Eli Page is an aging folk singer and “true counterculture icon” now forced to combat his failing mind. When Jack receives an offer to join Eli in Galesville, a small town on the border of New York and Vermont, and ghostwrite the idol’s biography, the past and present collide and uncover drama, secret guilts, and the realities behind broken individuals.
While Jack’s time with Eli acts as the foundation of the plot, it is not the novel’s main concern. “What you see here, on this stack of paper, is my story,” Jack narrates at the novel’s conclusion. “Eli just helped me play the right notes in the right order.” This proclamation asserts the novel’s greater interest in exploring Jack’s character—a narrative decision that Belcher is able to execute well by giving the protagonist many moments of solitude—instead of binding his story tightly to that of Eli’s. In that way, though the author’s decision to steer the focus away from Jack and Eli’s slowly developing friendship is surprising, it is a successful technique that allows him to fully develop his characters and the themes that they expound. For instance, Belcher characterizes Jack as gravely imperfect: He is distrustful, unable to put his father’s abandonment behind him. This flaw, however, becomes one way that Belcher considers the ways the past can affect the present.
Belcher also carefully emphasizes his themes by juxtaposing the characters’ stories against the larger backdrop of society. Indeed, social commentary is interspersed throughout Jack’s narration: “Everyone was worried about anthrax in white envelopes, snipers on the highways, airplanes falling from the sky; they were thinking about wars in caves, paint-by-number terror charts, and economic hijinks.” These references to American politics allow the novel to gain some realism, and as a result the novel often feels like an exploration of American culture. “[People are] happy to see their heroes knocked to the pavement only to get back up, bloodied but alive. It’s an American tradition,” Jack notes early in the book, indicating a clear relationship between fans’ reaction to Eli and American beliefs in general. Yet despite the explicit links between the United States and the characters, Belcher uses this direct connection only as a means to further paint the characters as real representatives of universal perspectives and beliefs. Throughout, the fear that Galesville feels towards outsider Eli represents the suspicions groups often harbor against those who are different. Meanwhile, Jack’s ignorant idolatry of Eli speaks to the popular desire to mythologize other human beings.
Strong writing supports Belcher’s brilliant explorations of ideas and characters: The author’s language is simple and unassuming while also being potent. Belcher does not attempt to impress readers by using complex vocabulary. Instead he tells his story with poetic prose, imaginative in its ability to express complicated and serious concepts with a certain musicality—a fitting quality for a novel that concerns a singer. “She was the epicenter of grief, alone in time and space, floating about the casket with the rotting body inside, among the blue hue of heaven inside the flag, beyond its stars,” Jack says of a widow during her husband’s wake. The poignant language encapsulated here permeates the entire novel, contributing to the story’s reflective and often mournful mood.
Through its thoughtful structure and execution, “Lay Down Your Weary Tune” ultimately presents a powerful and moving exploration of pasts and legends in the American imagination. The complexity of the novel’s treatment of its themes not only gives it an emotional weight but also distinguishes it from similar stories. In that way, Belcher’s debut is an incredible read and—if it is any indication of his future works—only foreshadows his potential and prowess as a budding writer.

“If You Can Tell” is the highly anticipated seventh collection of poetry by James McMichael, writer of  the 2006 National Book Award in Poetry finalist “Capacity.” Like“Capacity,” “If You Can Tell” has short lines characteristic of the poet’s recent work, unlike his earlier long-lined, explicitly autobiographical poems. In this latest collection, he effectively completes his shift from an emotive, personal tone to a dispassionate and ponderous one with densely packed lines sometimes as short as a single syllable. Composed of eight long, flooring poems, “If You Can Tell” beautifully traces the life of a boy as he meditates on questions of what is unseen and what is assumed, particularly God and the tautological nature of religion.
McMichael creates a successful transformation in his speaker as the boy searches for God and the unseen, a metamorphosis made most apparent in the contrast between the opening and closing poems. The former begins the conversation with the fittingly titled “The Believed In.” “Christmas comes from stories,” McMichael opens. He then springboards from this one-liner to an investigation of God, older generations, and love. The very same stories that construct Christmas, a stand-alone holiday, also harbor a “promise that God’s love for us will outstrip death.”  But even having acknowledged a believed-in God, the speaker would “rather it be // love that at its last the body can’t // take anymore and dies of.” These lines introduce a thoughtful binary that will continue throughout the poems: Individual resilience and a reliance on humanity versus God himself, in all the glory and mystery that surrounds him.
By the final poem, the speaker is jaded and frankly yet masterfully addresses the problems he sees in a faulty God. God’s love and faith is unconditional, the speaker asserts, “on one condition. / ‘If you are not My people, / I am not your God.’” This unsettlingly conditional love and power given to those who believe echoes in the rest of the poem as the speaker makes his final, profound move toward meditations on death and how it applies to himself. “God’s said to let the truthful / keep their lives forever if they swear God / does what He says,” McMichael writes. In this passage, the speaker capably explores the unsatisfying if-then aspect of religious belief and decides that if all of it is true, life is rendered obsolete, as it has no lasting effects on individuals. After addressing the vital problems of religion, the subject the poem naturally resolves on is death. The turn is so fitting—it is as though the speaker simply stumbles upon the revelation that Death, silent, hovers in the background: “Under its breath it primes me to pay up and look pleasant.” From beginning to end, the speaker is a vessel through which McMichael ponders the greater questions of faith and religion and the space between the two.
The language of the book itself is inventive and subversive to the point of forcing a careful reading. McMichael’s measured and plain language is a wonderfully sharp contrast to the speaker’s muddled, late-life process of sorting memory and wonderings into a cohesive whole. He has, in this collection, mastered the art of the short line. Varied stanza length and line syllable allowance refresh his compact, coiled, highly allusive language to create poems that never settle into a tiring tone. Word plays, inverted sentence structure, and pronoun games accumulate before giving way to a rumination on life’s stages. The poems, told in an unspecified past tense, reflect on a life both full and oddly incomplete, containing hollow parts filled with longing for wonder that turns into an attempt at religion. The speaker is caught up in insecurity over a lack of strong belief in God: “I wanted to be asleep so I wouldn’t go on making // God up out of the wind.”
The larger image of God in the poems is a looking glass through which the speaker explores issues of faith within a Christian context. “I’m not awake to God as the father of Jesus. / (God remains // God to me / and not a person),” the speaker says, revealing the inaccessible nature of religion. However, the poems are neither strictly devout nor strictly doubting, purposefully reflecting the human predicament of faith and forever suspended in a place between “Nowhere-yet” and “Nowhere-any-longer.” Yet the meditations are certainly not unfruitful. The speaker’s quest to belief inheres comprehensive questions on the nature of time, trust, intimacy, and attachment, and his preoccupation with death makes the need for the questions more intense, even as it makes the answers more difficult—even impossible—to find. “If You Can Tell” combines mastery of both the creation and the formatic manipulation of language to create an exquisite search for meaning common to every human soul.

2016 is the year of the house master. Or rather, it’s the year the house master will die.
MIT is just the latest in a line of colleges—Harvard included—to move toward striking the title, usually assigned to someone who leads a residence hall, in favor of something more palatable to protestors who are uncomfortable with the possible slavery associations the word “master” holds.
This is silly.
For one thing, the focus is in the wrong place. If any argument about the word “master” in its academic context holds ground, that argument revolves around gender: House master is a title for males, which made sense for the many years that women were shut out of academia. Now, as they’re climbing tenure ladders across the country, it seems less reasonable that women should take on a title that not only doesn’t fit their sex but also got its gendered name from a status quo that kept them out of the classroom.
When it comes to race, the same argument just doesn’t work. House masters at Harvard, Princeton, and MIT weren’t called house masters because they owned slaves, or even because they were white. The relation between house master and slave master is the same as the relation between a planation overseer and Harvard’s board of overseers: semantic. And any time we play six degrees of separation with words, we’re bound to find something disagreeable.
Again, it’s silly. But silly doesn’t mean insidious.
At first, when I heard Harvard planned to nix the master moniker, I was mad—not least for the reasons above, and also because I already knew where I stand on razing every statue of a Confederate soldier, or changing the name of Columbus Day: It’s dishonest and dangerous to pick and choose what parts of our history we want to remember. Instead of cutting chapters from the historical narrative, we should grapple with what’s written. That’s the best way to make sure future chapters read better.
Yet in this case, I’ve come to realize my initial logic worked against me: If “master” doesn’t have any real relation to slavery, then what important bit of history are we losing by ridding ourselves of the title? There’s little benefit in removing “House master” from Harvard’s vocabulary, yet there’s equally little cost. And when every leader of Harvard’s 12 Houses has signed onto the need for new nomenclature—when they say it doesn’t represent the role they really play in their communities—then I’m not so sure it’s my place to cry foul.
All this to say, when the next campus controversy makes its way to Cambridge, we shouldn’t jerk our knees too hard—left or right. I still worry about the “master” conversation in the context of other changes that threaten to obscure the past: Even if the word itself has small historical value, the clamor to do away with it seems another sign that we’re all too ready to hide certain parts of our history. It’s also a sign that we believe we can fix far-reaching issues of inclusivity with words instead of action. But just as some scramble to strike symbols, statues, and more from the historical consciousness, others are sometimes too quick to condemn every effort at change. I might be one of them.
Of course, this is about more than just house masters, Confederates, and Columbus. It’s also about how we talk about other hot-button topics today, when everything is personal and political at once—about how we have a much easier time forcing each issue into our prepackaged worldviews than we do entertaining the thought that some things might not fit. The house master debate shows that not all questions are easy, and that when it comes to answering them we need to think harder.

The Wellesley College Board of Trustees unanimously approved the appointment of Harvard Medical School professor Paula A. Johnson ’80 as the first African-American president of Wellesley College.
Johnson, a professor of Epidemiology, will replace current Wellesley President H. Kim Bottomly, who will step down in July after serving in the post since 2007.
Johnson gave a welcome address Friday in Wellesley’s Diana Chapman Walsh Alumnae Hall to a room packed with students, faculty, and alumnae.
“There was so much positive energy and excitement in the room,” Charlotte Harris, one of two students on a search committee composed of trustees, students, faculty, staff, and alumnae—which unanimously recommended Johnson’s appointment—said.
Johnson, who helped found the Connors Center for Women’s Health and Gender Biology in the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in an interview she hopes to expand global education for women who are stepping into leadership positions.
“We’re at a point in time where women’s leadership is finally being recognized as really transformative to the world and there’s also increasing inequity. So, there’s a real opportunity for Wellesley to play an even more significant role in the education of women,” Johnson said.
Students and faculty praised Johnson for her experience in women’s health and education, which they said was a major factor in the selection committee’s decision. As part of the search, committee members held several input sessions with Wellesley undergraduates and incorporated the feedback into a 16-page document, Harris said.
“What set Dr. Johnson apart from all the other candidates is her enthusiasm in her work… her true understanding of the importance of a liberal arts college and the education of women,” Shivani Kuckreja, the other student on the search committee, said.
Several Wellesley students expressed excitement at Johnson’s appointment, with many emphasizing that, of the college’s now-14 presidents, Johnson will be the first African-American leader.
“Paula Johnson will have better ability... in terms of her experience of being a black woman to deal with needs of students of African descent,” Sydney Stewart, co-chair of the Ethos Political Action Committee, a Wellesley group for students of African-American descent, said.
Pointing to her medical background, Johnson said she is interested in student health and wellness, which she recognized as major points of concern for campuses across the nation.
“Mental health is a really big issue here. Lots of people recognize that the environment we live in is high-stress,” Stewart said. “She’ll better be able to address the needs of students when it comes to mental health because of her expertise in the field of medicine.”
Cathy Zhang, who studies chemistry at Wellesley, similarly praised Johnson’s medical background.
“I think she can take her skill and expertise and really just help our science program and outreach grow further, and I’m just really excited about that,” Zhang said.
Besides Johnson’s credentials, “having [a president] who has lived around and near Wellesley will give her insight into the school,” Harris said. Johnson’s family—she has two children, including Jonathan A. Sands ’17—also allows her to better understand issues affecting undergraduates, Harris said.

A small crowd donned “I love toilets” stickers for the grand opening of a new public restroom in General MacArthur Park at the convergence of Church Street and Massachusetts Avenue on Friday. 
The restroom's installation was the result of a community initiative aimed to provide the city’s homeless population with a basic public amenity.
Richard Parker, a Harvard Kennedy School lecturer, was at the forefront of the initiative. A Cambridge resident of 25 years, Parker said he has watched the homeless population steadily grow and thought a public toilet would be a small step towards helping the homeless. As a result, he launched a petition that garnered about 7,000 signatures.
Parker said that, following nearby Christ Church’s decision to close its restrooms to the public due to drug overdoses and staff harassment, there was a “situation in which there were hundreds of people who had no facilities and you know, like eating and sleeping, this is one of the fundamental human needs.”
Parker teamed up with partners ranging from churches to businesses to mobilize the effort to install a new restroom.
“It was parents of young kids in the park, because they had no place to take their kids, the Business Association because homeless people were urinating and defecating in the alleys,” Julie B. Wilson, also Harvard Kennedy School lecturer, said. “So in the end there was a big coalition that was pretty broad.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, was also a part of the coalition. Jillson said after Christ Church was no longer able to accommodate homeless restroom use, “the cause and effect on the business community was almost immediate.”
The Cambridge Police Department ensured the security of the facility and community remained a priority.
“We were involved in the entire planning process from start to finish,” Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas said. “I think the design [of the restroom] really speaks to some of the concerns that we had to make sure that if somebody goes in there and needs help, we can get in there and help them.”

Local leaders credited the project’s success to the coordination across different organizations in Cambridge.
“This comfort station is really a testimony to the work of a lot of people,” Mayor E. Denise Simmons said during the opening ceremony. “In so many ways, it really is a public-private partnership where the City Council got together hearing the needs of so many individuals to do something that’s really going to have an impact on the Square.”

We’re now in the home stretch of the year. We await the coming of spring, which will probably arrive by late May if we’re lucky. But also approaching very quickly (or slowly depending on who you are) are the deadlines for senior theses. Of course not all seniors will be trading in their social lives for some quality time with their laptop in the library this semester. In fact, there is quite a sharp distinction between your studious, stressed out, sleep deprived senior working on a thesis, and your checked out, never stressed non-thesising senior who seemingly never leaves the Dhall. Two very different breeds of senior who do not take being mixed up lightly. We’re here to help you spot the difference.
In their natural habitat, a senior who has decided to go on the journey called thesis will typically not be seen for months. This is because they’ll be at the same desk in Lamont Library for days in row. Or that cozy corner in the Starbucks until 1 am only to come back again when it opens at 5 am. A senior needs to find a place(s) to make his or her most coherent BS flow the best. And for most of them, this involves hiding out in some form of isolation with only the occasional Facebook stalking to them company.
In addition, often at their side would be at least one stack of books near them, though seven is more likely. It will never, ever be a neat stack. And you might wonder how they might be able to carry such a load from place to place. At its worst, a senior undergoing this mission will use a suitcase to shuttle the books they just decided to reserve from Widener. Be careful not to confuse this with students heading off to multiple consulting/finance final interviews.
But a way to differentiate those two would be the attire. A person going to said interview may already be wearing a suit/ dress despite the fact it actually occurs the next morning. The thesising senior will not be dressing up most of the time. They will wear the clothes that are easy to wear and will not waste any time they could spend actually outlining. So most likely sweats, greasy hair, and glasses will be your dead giveaway. In addition they might carry a smell that is a mix of old coffee, sleep deprivation, and of course, regret.
And finally if one gets very very close a senior, the best way to find out if there are doing a thesis is if they tell you. They will eventually talk excessively about each chapter of their thesis. Or how they did research for said thesis. And how they have their thesis advisor on speed dial. And just maybe, they will ask you for help naming it.
With these guidelines you should have no problem identifying, and avoiding at all costs, any thesising senior. If you should encounter one, please remember they often don’t have time for regular showers and thus should be admired from afar. Happy hunting.

Kanye dropped an album yesterday and, as with anything that he does, we’re not quite sure how we feel about it. The first thing to note is that, unless you have Tidal (which we’re guessing that you don’t; broke college kids can only handle so many monthly music subscriptions and Spotify is clearly the move) you don’t yet have access to the album. Apparently Kanye wants Life of Pablo to be a permanent Tidal exclusive, so maybe start saving up now?
In true Ye fashion, he debuted the album via a trippy fashion show in Madison Square Garden on Thursday where his models, clad in a menagerie of… interesting clothing, stood in various states of hipster disinterest while his tracks played in the background. It was like a giant listening party with a staging that was reportedly influenced by a photo of a Rwandan refugee camp. Yeah—it’s super trippy.
The album itself was a giant divergence from his previous album, “Yeezus,” although there was a definite religious vein throughout this album too—from the very first song Ultralight Beam (which sounded like it was plucked straight out of a Chance the Rapper performance) to Low Lights.
Also overtly obvious was how much this album was a giant middle finger to the bad publicity Kanye’s been receiving the past few years. All of his songs had that vibe of “screw what my haters say, this the real Ye” which, quite frankly, is respectable. But then in the song “Famous,” Kanye flaunts his alleged extensive sex life (wait, isn’t he married?) and how much he would love to do the dirty with Taylor Swift. You know, the pop star who (allegedly) said that Kanye  “made me famous” when he embarrassed her on stage at the VMAs. Not cool, Kanye.
We recommend the album, if for no other reason than it being a truly wild ride. Of course, there’s probably a million specific artistic comments that can be made about the album, but we’ll save that for true art critics.

I haven’t had a good cry in a long time, probably five or so years. I’m not talking about just that small little tear action you get when you watch a kind of sad rom com or are stuck writing a paper in Lamont at 3 a.m.—that happens almost every week, at a minimum. I’m talking about real tears, like Niagara Falls-style.
However, this weekend I finally had a good cry. The reason? El Niño.
A few weeks ago I had the splendid idea to help out at this year’s Harvard Debate Tournament as a judge. The tournament took place this weekend and it sprawled across the entire Harvard campus. As an Adams House denizen, I’m never happy to learn that I have to walk all the way to the Quad, especially not for an extracurricular. I was doubly sad to learn that these rounds were slated to start at 7:30 a.m.
And oh, right, the windchill this weekend was minus 36 degrees. It was cold.
For reasons that are still unknown to me at the moment, I thought that it would be preferable to walk to the Quad (in the cold) than to wait for the shuttle (also in the cold.) This was a terrible idea. It was so cold I thought I had died, then somehow been resurrected as the White Witch Queen of Narnia, only to die again of hypothermia and sadness.
There's a saying that "real men aren’t afraid to cry." If that's true, then as of yesterday, I am now the manliest of men. I bawled on my walk to the Quad. My tears actually froze on my face. I wish I was kidding. It hurt.
So if you’re looking to learn how to combat this winter weather, all I can recommend is that you (1) don’t forget to bring a warm hat and (2) bring tissues. Lots of tissues.

Conan C. O’Brien ’85  and I became friends on Friday. Like, personal, have-slumber-parties-and-swap-secrets friends. We laughed together, we cried together, and we took a selfie together. I swear I kept my cool. (Editor’s note: no, he didn’t).
Coco was in town to speak with University President Drew G. Faust about the importance of a liberal arts education in front of hundreds of students in Sanders Theatre. More importantly, though, he was in town to meet his new best friend: Me.
After a 30 minute discussion with Faust and almost an hour of answering questions from the crowd (he even dabbed at one point), Conan descended to the depths beneath Sanders. I and my fellow very cool student journalist friends/late-night TV show host groupies waited around and eventually, with the helpful guidance of a few Harvard staffers, gathered outside of Conan’s “green room.”
It’s common knowledge that Conan is tall—his Wikipedia page says he’s 6’ 4’’—but I am pretty sure international fame adds a few inches. Once his aides gave us the go ahead, we entered the Coco lair and met the man himself. Immediate impressions: he’s quite tall (did I already say this?), and if you stare at his (magnificent) hair for too long, you will become slightly dizzy. Also, he’s a really nice guy.
After taking some selfies with us, Conan sat down and answered questions for 15 minutes. Here at Flyby, we asked the most hard-hitting of hard-hitting questions: Does he have any tips for us at 14 Plympton for our ongoing prank war against the Lampoon, the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine? (We are, admittedly, losing this war). Conan was the President of the Lampoon and a notorious prankster during his time here, so we hoped he might be able to trade some secrets with the other side.
“I would say: don’t be afraid to step it up a notch, you know. Maybe it’s time to move past 'We stole their chair, they stole ours.' Maybe it’s time to use explosives, I’m just putting that out there,” O’Brien said. “It’s time to take it up a notch, alright? That’s all I’m saying. It’s time to escalate.”
Here at Flyby, we’re taking Conan’s advice to heart. Well, maybe except for the explosives thing. But look out, Lampoon.
