After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lee Forest, who was hired by the College in September as the first director of bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgender student life has decided to turn down the position at Harvard.
In an email to student leaders of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever, the Harvard Trans Task Force, and Girlspot, Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life, Emelyn A. dela Pena said Forest had chosen not to accept the position for “personal and professional reasons.”
Forest was scheduled to begin her new position on Tuesday.
On Friday, Assistant Dean of Student Life, Emelyn dela Pena called student leaders of LGBTQ organizations to an urgent meeting.
Led by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. Macintosh, the administrators notified LGBTQ student organization presidents of Forest’s sudden decision.
“Everyone is disappointed,” said QSA co-president Samuel J. Bakkila '11-'12. “This is something we’ve been looking forward to for a long time.”
Co-president of GLOW, Miguel Garcia ’12, said he was disappointed and frustrated at the sudden nature of Forest’s decision.
Emily J. Miller, a student at the Divinity School, who had previously served as the graduate assistant for LGBTQ student life will assume the position of interim coordinator of LGBTQ student life while the search committee looks for someone to fill the now-vacant director position.
Though they say Miller has been a helpful resource in her role as graduate assistant, both Garcia and Bakkila expressed concern that there will not be a permanent director until next year.
“This is kind of bad timing because [the director position] is something that is needed to keep a lot of things going right now,” Bakkila said.
Garcia echoed that sentiment.
“Her responsibilities have not been defined at all,” he said, referring to Miller's position. “It is unclear what her role will be.”
Miller’s status as a full-time student was also a point of concern, since she will now be expected to work 30 hours per week in the space dedicated to LGBTQ issues in the basement of Boylston Hall.
Though the LGBTQ community has existed without an administrative presence in the past, Garcia said they need an authority figure to represent the LGBTQ-identified students on campus.
Garcia said that in the past when there has been an incident like a hate crime that directly affects the gay community, the lack of an administrator to advocate on behalf of LGBTQ students has caused concern within the community about how to adequately respond to such incidents.
In her email, dela Pena said that the search committee would reconvene and begin another search in January or February.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite going down a goal in the first period, the Harvard women’s hockey team (1-0, 1-0 ECAC) scored two in the first five minutes of the second frame on its way to a commanding 7-1 victory over St. Lawrence (3-3-2, 0-1 ECAC) Friday night at the Appleton Arena.
“Our team feels really good coming off of that win,” said sophomore forward Marissa Gedman, who tallied the game-winning goal. “It’s huge, setting tone for the rest of our season. I’m really excited about how we played but also how we handled ourselves.”
The Crimson got on the board at 1:24 in the second period, as freshman forward Sami Reber carried the puck out of neutral territory and found sophomore forward Lyndsey Fry with a back pass.
“[Fry] trailed behind me and was calling for the puck,” Reber said. “I banked it back. She walked it in about 15 feet and hit a nice shot.”
Just 3:06 later, Harvard struck again. This time, junior forward Kaitlin Spurling found sophomore forward Gina McDonald on the run. McDonald played a one-touch pass to Gedman who put it away, forcing St. Lawrence into a deficit from which it would not recover.
“One of the [St. Lawrence defenders] pinched down and the puck fell toward me,” Spurling said. “Our coach has been getting on us about winning the little battles and being physical. I lifted her stick, pushed her off the puck and passed to [McDonald].”
The Crimson scored its next three goals on power plays, with junior forward Jillian Dempsey and Fry each finding the net in the second period. Dempsey helped Harvard keep its momentum going into the third, notching her second goal of the day at 6:49 in the final frame.
“Our two power play units are very strong,” Gedman said. “We’ve been spending extra time [on that part of our game] during and after practice…I wouldn’t say [the power play] was our greatest feature last year, so we’ve been working hard to change that. It was a huge thing for us to get those power-play goals.”
St. Lawrence—slated to finish sixth in the ECAC by the preseason coaches poll—was first to capitalize on a power play Friday night, as two Harvard fouls gave the Saints a 5-3 numbers advantage. Brooke Fernanez slotted the puck past junior goaltender Laura Bellamy at 18:22 in the first frame to give St. Lawrence its only lead of the day, despite an 8-5 Crimson shot advantage that period.
“We did a pretty good job on that kill,” Gedman said. “Those are tough odds, and they scored. But I think it was good for us ... We came back with fire in second period.”
Although the first frame proved unfruitful for Harvard, the Crimson dominated the play, outshooting the Saints, 46-18, on the night and forcing St. Lawrence goaltender Carmen McDonald to make 39 saves.
Reber and McDonald scored Harvard’s final two goals in the third period, helping the Crimson secure its first victory of the regular season.
“Our small roster doesn’t say anything about our depth,” Reber said. “Whoever’s on the ice can score, back check, do anything.”
The sophomore class had an impressive night for the Crimson, combining for 13 points on four goals and five assists. Gedman and Fry led the way, scoring four and five points, respectively.
“Our sophomore class is very close,” Gedman said. “Definitely this year, as sophomores, one of our focuses is on making a huge impact on the ice …We’re all very dedicated to the team and it’s great to see it on the scoreboard as well.”
Harvard showcased its depth Friday night, as eight different players scored points on Friday for the youthful Crimson.
“People are underestimating us and we’ve been trying to use that to our advantage,” Spurling said. “We’ve been able to play all three lines consistently…We have people from every single class contributing and wanting to win for each other. That’s what’s driving us.”
Friday’s game marked the first time in program history that Harvard played its season opener against St. Lawrence, as well as the Crimson’s first ECAC win of the year.
“We’re really excited to get going, league game or not,” Gedman said. “We only have 29 games, [so Harvard coach Katey Stone] has been telling us it’s just 1 out of 29. We’re hoping to get as many games as this in the future as possible, but we’re taking everything one game at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most of the season, Harvard football has been all about the pass.
But on a cold and snowy night at home Saturday, the Crimson (6-1, 4-0 Ivy) changed its game plan. And once again, the team dominated—and rewrote the record books along the way.
Behind 100-yard rushing days from senior quarterback Collier Winters, junior running back Treavor Scales, and freshman running back Zach Boden, Harvard handled Dartmouth (2-5, 1-3) from end to end and emerged victorious, 41-10.
The performances mark the first time that the Crimson has ever had three different players rush for at least 100 yards in a game. All three also scored two touchdowns.
“We’ve got two outstanding running backs, that’s for sure,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We didn’t expect Zach to rise to this point in the depth chart this soon.”
With the win, Murphy ties long-time Harvard coach Joe Restic all-time wins record in the program. Murphy picked up his 117th win as the team’s coach, his position since 1994.
The changes in the seemingly-fluid record books don’t end there. The victory marks the first time that Harvard has scored at least 40 points in four straight games since 1890.
But as far as the present is concerned, the biggest news of the day was about 50 miles south. Earlier in the day, Penn lost to Brown, 6-0, ending the Quaker’s 18-game Ivy League win streak. The Bears’ win gives Harvard sole possession of first place in the Ancient Eight and sets up a three-way tie between Brown, Penn, and Yale in second place.
For the first three games in Harvard’s streak of 40 or more points—one that dates back to a win at Cornell—passing was the story. But the Crimson adjusted its strategy given the inclement conditions, and the team was just as effective on the ground.
With the exception of a short drive that came at the close of the first half, the Big Green could not stop Harvard from reaching the end zone until the middle of the fourth quarter, and that was only after many of the team’s backups made it into the game.
The Crimson’s scoring barrage began early in the first, with Winters scrambling for a touchdown six minutes in. But after a missed extra point by Harvard kicker David Mothander, it looked like the weather would play a major role and keep scoring low all night.
In the final minute of the quarter, Dartmouth hit a 27-yard field goal to get within three. But that’s as close as the Big Green would get.
Already up by 10 in the second quarter, the biggest touchdown of the day may have come in the second. It started with Dartmouth punter Daniel Barstein’s kick that was downed at the Crimson’s one-yard line.
Harvard had to cover 99 yards to score, and the Big Green looked like it still had a chance mid-way through the period.
Fifteen plays later, Scales powered into the end zone on the opposite end of the field to give the Crimson a 17-point advantage on the near-freezing night.
“I think that’s the first time all year we’ve been under center,” Winters said of the first play on that drive. “It just started with a little QB sneak ... Our O-line did a fantastic job tonight. Having three 100-yard rushers, a lot of that is up to them.”
Dartmouth never recovered after that drive and failed to generate offensive momentum for the rest of the game.
“[That 99-yard drive] hurts,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “That’s a critical drive for them, and credit to them. They were flawless with their execution [and] mixed up their play selection well.”
With the game already moving out of reach, Harvard added three more touchdowns in the third quarter, and it was another one-yard Scales run with under a minute in the frame that pushed the team above the 40-point plateau once again.
Of the 15 snaps on that drive, 13 were run plays.
“Coming into the game, we expected bad weather, and we knew we had to establish the run game,” said senior offensive lineman Kevin Murphy. “The O-line tries to pride itself on being the toughest, most physical guys on the team … and we knew we had to execute.”
As a whole, the team ran for 395 yards, averaging 7.2 yards per carry.
Although Harvard and Dartmouth played under the lights, the official attendance of the game was only 6,029—by far the Crimson’s lowest home attendance this year. The actual number of people at the game was likely fewer than that.
But even with rough conditions and a revamped game plan, Harvard moved one game closer to capturing the Ivy crown.
“On Monday, the weather forecast was 20 percent precipitation,” Tim Murphy said. “On Wednesday, it was about 40. By Friday, we were going to have the storm of the century. So we changed our game plan about three times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than 24 hours after the Harvard women’s hockey team (2-0, 2-0 ECAC) won its first conference battle at St. Lawrence, sophomore forward Marissa Gedman broke the Crimson out of a 1-1 stalemate with ECAC rival Clarkson (4-2-4, 0-1-1) less than two minutes into overtime. Gedman’s goal—assisted by freshman defender Michelle Picard—sealed a 2-1 victory for Harvard.
Although the Crimson outshot the Golden Knights, 11-7, in the first period, neither team could convert its chances in the opening frame. In the second, Harvard got on the board first, as junior defender Josephine Pucci tallied a goal—her first of the young season—at 5:42 on a power play. But Clarkson tied it up, earning a power play goal of its own with less than a minute to play in the second period.
After a scoreless third period forced the game into overtime, the Crimson was able to come away with a win after an extra 1:24, exiting the first weekend of regular season play undefeated.
