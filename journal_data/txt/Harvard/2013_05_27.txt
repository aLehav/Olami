After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the late Washington governor Booth Gardner, a member of the Harvard Business School Class of 1963, reached his senior year at the University of Washington in 1958, Harvard Business School was not even on his radar.
As biographer John C. Hughes wrote in “Booth Who?”, the idea of applying to the Business School only occurred to Gardner after a snowstorm and a planning mishap made him the unofficial escort of former Harvard Business School Associate Dean J. Leslie Rollins when Rollins came to meet Business School prospective students at the University of Washington.
Hughes wrote that Rollins was immediately “impressed” with Gardner and encouraged him to apply.
Gardner ultimately matriculated to the Business School in the fall of 1961. There, he honed skills that—as several of Gardner’s political advisors told The Crimson—would be invaluable in his career in government. The former governor, who passed away this March, ran the state of Washington with a personal and compassionate management style, fighting for his beliefs until the end.
‘THE MOST MODEST MAN’
Gardner was born in Tacoma, Washington, in 1936. After attending the University of Washington and the Business School, he began a career in politics that ultimately coalesced in his successful election to the Washington governorship, where he served from 1985 to 1993.
Giving rise to the campaign motto “Booth Who?” when Gardner first ran for the governor in 1983, he was a little-known county executive in an election contest with the Republican incumbent John Spellman.
Gardner claimed to offer business acumen and managerial expertise to the people of Washington.
“Harvard—people can see that as snob appeal,” said political consultant Ron Dotzauer, who served as Gardner’s campaign manager. “But I used the Harvard Business degree to say ‘Who do you want to run your state?’”
Dotzauer ran a campaign ad that compared the two candidates’ resumes side-by-side.
“Booth didn’t have [HBS] emblazoned on his chest,” Dotzauer said. “But that was part of his resume that we ran on.”
Gardner also had worked at the Business School to work as an assistant to the dean in1966 before returning to Washington.
Speaking on the influence of the Business School on Gardner’s administrative style, Congressman Dennis Heck, who had served as Gardner’s as chief of staff, said, “The way he worked was to hire very good people, let them do their job, focus on a limited number of priorities...I’ve always assumed that part of that was Harvard.”
But after his campaign for the 1984 election, Gardner—like many politicians with Harvard degrees—downplayed his association with the University before the public. According to Heck, Gardner’s quietness about his Harvard experience stemmed not from political maneuvering but
rather from a deep-seeded humility.
Gardner was the stepson of the wealthy businessman Norton Clapp and as such the heir to the family fortune. But Heck described Gardner as a “most modest man” who had “the common touch” despite his wealth.
Throughout his political career, Gardner showed particular concern for the needs of the poor. In the late 1980s, Gardner signed into law “Basic Health,” a state-sponsored program that through private health plans would provide low-cost health care for the working poor.
“Here’s a man who could have lived a life of luxury, but he was always completely engaged in what was happening in the world and always put service above self,” said Ronald Erickson, a Washington-native who has served as a senior executive for several Washington-based companies.
A MBA AND A MBWA
Gardner’s political advisors agreed that sociability was one of his greatest attributes, allowing him to connect with his constituents, his political allies, and his political foes alike.
As Hughes wrote in “Booth Who?”, Gardner often said that more valuable than any MBA was his “MBWA,” his philosophy of managing by walking around.
Dia Armenta, who served as Gardner’s political strategist, said that despite having eaten out with the Gardner on dozens of occasions, she could not recall ever walking straight with the Governor from the entrance of a restaurant to their table. The Go
vernor instead would head to kitchen and talk to the staff and waitresses.
Armenta said that years after the Governor’s tenure ended, Gardner would visit the capitol offices and chat with the receptionists and other clerical workers who had served under his administration as well.
“He wanted to know how their families were doing. He remembered their names,” Armenta said.
As Dotzauer said, with a natural friendliness and a good memory for names, Gardner was adept at campaigning. But Dotzauer noted that, ironically, Gardner abhorred the campaign trail.
“When he first ran for governor in 1983, he’d say Ron, ‘I just wish I could apply for this job. I’d be hired,’” Dotzauer said. Laughing, he added, “This is what you’d expect from a Harvard MBA.”
CAMPAIGNING TILL THE END
By the time Gardner left the governorship in 1993, Washington was a leader in the realms of health services and environmental management. Gardner had also been a champion of equality.
In a move that Heck called “ahead of the times,” Gardner had also issued an executive order, banning discrimination against gay and lesbian state workers.
After doctors diagnosed him with Parkinson’s disease in 1994, Gardner was inspired to re-enter public life to launch what he said would his last campaign—to legalize physician-assisted suicide—stemming from Gardner’s desire to control his own time of death and to avoid prolonged suffering.
But to increase its chance at passage, Gardner changed the legislation to mirror the Oregon law on physician-assisted suicide, which restricted it to terminally-ill patients.
Gardner’s last campaign proved to be a success, and Washington voters approved his proposal in 2008. But Gardner did not stand to benefit from the legislation he championed.
Director Daniel Junge created a documentary entitled “The Last Campaign of Governor Booth Gardner,” which followed Gardner’s campaign for physician-assisted suicide.
“I think it’s just remarkable that here’s a guy at the end of his life when he should be sitting back...but he chose such a contentious issue to put the political capital he had in,” Junge said. “It just speaks to his passion for civil service.”
At Gardner’s memorial service this spring, President of the University of Puget Sound Ron R. Thomas spoke of the “indelible” mark he left on Washington politics.
Alluding to Gardner’s infamous political slogan, Thomas said, “There is now, almost no one, who doesn’t know who Booth was.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark E. Talisman ’63 carried wood from a shipyard, to the T, through Harvard Square, and up five flights of stairs in Matthews Hall. Creating large sculptures with the wood he collected, he would work in his room or in space he could find outside.
But in Talisman’s senior year, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts opened to provide a home for Harvard’s student and faculty artists. The Carpenter Center, modern architecture pioneer Le Corbusier’s first and only North American structure, was and remains the official home of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies.
The construction of the art building signaled a decisive change in the trajectory of the College’s attitude toward the study and creation of art in the classroom, creating new space for students to learn, create, and exhibit their work.
“This legitimization of fine arts changed everyone’s lives,” said Frank P. Mouris ’66, an Oscar-award winning filmmaker who credits the Carpenter Center for cultivating a continued love of the arts. “It’s powerful that the building itself could inspire so many students to continue creating.”
A SPACE OF THEIR OWN
Prior to the Carpenter Center’s opening, Harvard did not have a central space in which students could practice and display their art. The College offered art classes before to 1963, but these classes were often taught in conjunction with other schools in the University system.
“There were always art classes, just no place to house them,” said David Rodowick, director of the Carpenter Center and the department chair of Visual and Environmental Studies. “The classes predating the opening of the Carpenter Center were probably being taught under the umbrella of the Graduate School of Design.”
Because the classes offered before 1963 dealt mostly with classical art or architecture, students wanting to practice their art in a studio class were left to find their own art spaces. This meant working more closely with the Houses and House Masters to find local spaces where they could make and exhibit their artwork.
“There was never enough exhibition space in the Square,” Talisman said. “Especially not for students like me who weren’t professionals but badly wanted to have our art showcased.”
As a result, students turned to churches, House libraries, and the Brattle Theater for exhibition space. The House Masters in Quincy House agreed to show Talisman’s work in their residence in order compensate for the College’s lack of showcasing venues.
“It was crazy that they wouldn’t have made space for that. We as artists were left to suffer out in the cold,” Talisman said.
“A FAT CONCRETE WEDGE”
Made of concrete and covered in straight lines, the Carpenter Center was erected in contrast to Quincy Street’s staple Neo-Georgian, classic Harvard red brick structures. Designed by Le Corbusier, the building’s obvious contrast to its surroundings solicited criticism.
“There was certainly a big controversy about having this modernist icon amongst the [Harvard] Faculty Club and the red bricks,” Rodowick told The Crimson in September. “[Le Corbusier] knew that this would be his only major building in North America, so he was essentially given carte blanche.”
The building is significant for more than just providing the department of Visual and Environmental Studies a space, according to Rodowick.
“The building is special not only because it is unique but because it is an art building,” Rodowick said. “It was meant to be an artistic capstone to his career.”
But when Mouris first toured Harvard’s campus, he said he that—despite the building’s status as a Le Corbusier original—the Carpenter Center looked like “a fat concrete wedge.”
But Talisman said that the rejection of the Carpenter Center was a hesitation to changing architectural styles.
“I thought that the whole thing was amusing, honestly. These protests were little more than half-baked discussions about shifting architectural norms,” Talisman said.
The building’s design also allowed some students to use the structure for unorthodox purposes.
“People would drive their Volkswagons off of the ramps for fun some days. We had some exciting times at the Carpenter Center after hours,” Mouris said.
Despite any disliked the building’s aesthetic, Mouris explained that the cause to create a space for artists “was so hard fought,” the building’s appearance “didn’t matter.”
FORM INFORMING CONTENT
Harvard’s art curriculum slowly began to change with the addition of the Carpenter Center, culminating in the creation of the Visual and Environmental Studies Department in 1968. The space allowed for the creation of more studio classes as well a gallery for student art.
“The Carpenter Center was always meant to be an exhibition space. We feature work by students, faculty, and visiting artists on a regular basement in our galleries,” Rodowick said.
The building itself was a momentous step in the evolution of student art at Harvard.
“There exists a spark deep inside students, and it is the College’s duty to ennoble and enlarge this spark. Art should never ever be suppressed by necessity or space constraints,” Talisman said.
The program expanded with time in order to accommodate digital media, and students were eventually showcasing both live-action and animated films. Mouris would go on from the Graduate School of Design architecture program offered jointly with the Carpenter Center to teach animation to future Visual and Environmental Studies students and win an Oscar for his animated short “Frank Film”.
“I owe all of that to the Carpenter Center. It changed my life,” Mouris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During his freshman year at Harvard College, Christopher A. Sims ’63 remembers a mathematics teaching assistant warning him about a career in math.
“You would make a fine mathematician,” he recalled the teaching assistant saying. “But as a mathematician, you won’t be able to change the world.”
Sims pursued his undergraduate degree in mathematics but would later go on to study economics, winning a Nobel Prize for his work on fiscal theory and macroeconomics. The heralded academic—whose awarded work focuses on monetary policy—was an active member of the Class of 1963, manifesting his many interests across campus.
Choosing to make a career in applicable economics instead of abstract mathematics, Sims has striven to connect the theory with the data—a dedication to both the abstract and the literal that defines not only his career, but his life as both an academic, activist, father, husband, and horseback rider.
PASSION FOR ACTION
A member of the Harvard University Band, a club rugby player, a political activist, and a math prodigy, Sims was active around campus during his time at Harvard.
Sims was born in 1942 in Washington D.C.. His father—employed by the State Department—moved the family to Germany for two years when Sims was five. After Germany, the family moved to Virginia and then Connecticut. Sims was the third-string linebacker for the Greenwich High School football team and played trombone in the band.
He continued playing trombone for Harvard’s band, and switched football for club rugby and the occasional soccer game.
As an undergraduate, Sims was also involved in the student group called Tocsin, which supported policies to the left of President Kennedy and focused on nuclear proliferation.
As a member of Tocsin, Sims helped plan a march on Washington to urge President Kennedy to continue his temporary halt of nuclear testing and to give up the administration’s fallout shelter program. The march brought 60,000 students to the Washington mall.
Organizing the march “was exciting, and we felt that we had a little bit of an impact,” Sims said. “[I’m] not sure if we really did but that was kind of a high point.”
Todd A. Gitlin ’63, former president of Tocsin, remembered spending time in the car on the way to the march and remarked that Sims was easy going and cool under pressure.
As a junior, Sims organized a group of Tocsin students to travel to Connecticut to campaign for a proliferation candidate, Frank Kowalski, as a part of a larger effort to advocate for the ban of nuclear weapons. Sims said at the time that he hoped the activism would add to the larger conversation of constructive criticism that Tocsin hoped to inform.
“In Tocsin he was thoughtful, easy-going, committed, passionate about turning around the arms race, and enormously liked and respected by everyone. I mean everyone,” said fellow Tocsin member Peter C. Goldmark ’62.
BEYOND THE ABSTRACT
After concentrating in mathematics in undergraduate, Sims said he was weary of spending a career in the abstractions of upper-level mathematics. Instead, he would go on to earn his doctorate degree from Harvard in 1968 in economics, and then begin a career in academia—including as an assistant professor at Harvard from 1968 to 1970.
Sims joined the faculty at Princeton University in 1999. Alan S. Blinder recalled Princeton’s attempt to recruit Sims in 1990 as he had gotten to know Sims at various conferences.
“He is very straight-laced. He is very serious about what he does and very, very good at what he does,” Blinder said.
In addition to innovative research at Princeton, former students say that he was available and patient as an advisor and teacher.
“Whenever he was in Princeton whenever he was in his office, his door was always open, and I could just most of the time stop by and…in the worst case he would tell me to come back later or come back tomorrow,” Primaceri said. “His availability was incredible and the depth of his thought and of his suggestions and of his comments on my research were just you know I don’t know how to describe them, it was incredible.”
In 1995, Sims was the president of the Econometric Society. In 2012, he served as the president of the American Economic Association.
In 2011, Sims and New York University economist Thomas Sargent were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. The “40-year path of friendly arguments and groundbreaking studies of how governments weigh policies to deal with economic troubles has led a pair of prominent economists to share the 2011 Nobel Prize in their field,” according to a Princeton press release.
The pair were recognized for their contribution to the field of macroeconomics and its applicable indications for banks and monetary policy.
“I was very happy to win it with Tom,” Sims said. “[T]he fact that they awarded the prize to us, I see as, a kind of affirmation of the importance of the approach to macroeconomics that we take that insists on connecting theory to data.”
Although Sims is grateful for the recognition the Nobel brings, he lamented the increased amount of time he has to spend traveling and said he is looking forward to an upcoming two month continuous stay in Princeton.
Meanwhile, he recently took up horseback riding as his wife Cathie has been an avid rider since a young.  He continues to play the trombone and, according to Blinder and Primaceri, frequently engages in long discussions on current affairs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I have memories of standing in circles of people, who didn’t realize who he was. They would offer some explanation about the C language, Dennis would politely offer an alternate opinion, and the speaker would adamantly explain that Dennis was wrong,” Margo I. Seltzer ’83, professor of computer science, said of Dennis M. Ritchie ’63.
Friends and colleagues say modesty and kindness defined Ritchie, the co-creator of the widely used C programming language and Unix operating system, who passed away in October 2011.
Born in Bronxville, New York, Ritchie’s family moved to Summit, New Jersey, where Ritchie would graduate from high school. One of the nation’s leading computer science pioneers, Ritchie spent both his undergraduate and graduate years at Harvard. He studied physics at the College and lived in Wigglesworth and Leverett House. As a graduate student, Ritchie studied applied math.
BUILDING FOUNDATIONS
“My undergraduate experience convinced me that I was not smart enough to be a physicist, and that computers were quite neat,” Ritchie wrote in his biography for Bell Laboratories, the lab that would be his home for 40 years. “My graduate school experience convinced me that I was not smart enough to be an expert in the theory of algorithms and also that I liked procedural languages better than functional ones.”
Ritchie would rewrite the world of procedural languages during his career at Bell Labs, which began as a doctoral student at Harvard in 1967 and ended with his retirement in 2007. Bell Labs ran in the family. Ritchie’s father, Alistair E. Ritchie, had also had a long career there.
Brian W. Kernighan, a professor of computer science at Princeton, was a colleague of Ritchie at Bell Labs for three of those four decades. As fellow scientists, they co-authored the program and book “The C Programming Language.”
Selzer said Ritchie and Kernighan’s book “The C Programming Language” was what “many people in the industry refer to as ‘The Bible.’”
Programmer Charles Petzold commented on C’s “unlimited flexibility” in a piece published in the New York Times in 1996.
“It appeals to the macho instincts of young and wild PC hackers, as well to the puzzle-solving impulses of more mature programmers because of its power and the variety of ways to solve problems,” Petzold wrote.
C was the foundation for the creation of Unix, which Ritchie created with Bell Labs colleague Kenneth L. Thompson. Unix “has essentially been the model of modern operating systems for the past 35 years,” according to Selzer, and serves as original ancestor for current Windows and Apple personal computers operating systems.
Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science known informally as the Nobel Prize of computing, in 1983 for their development of Unix.  In 1998, they were awarded the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton.
In the Washington Post’s memorial piece of Ritchie, Paul E. Ceruzzi, a Smithsonian historian, compared Ritchie’s life to that of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose death—which came seven days before Ritchie’s—was highly publicized.
“Ritchie was under the radar,” Ceruzzi said. “His name was not a household name at all, but...if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you’d see his work everywhere inside.”
Following Ritchie’s death, Harvard professor of computer science Harry Lewis blogged about Ritchie’s contribution to the field of computer science.
“Ritchie bears more personal responsibility than anyone else for C and Unix, and hence for their many derivatives. The world would be a VERY different place had he not created these things,” Lewis wrote.
MAN BEHIND THE SCREEN
Ritchie was fascinated by naked mole rats and hated wearing ties. He had a dry sense of humor and was known to pull pranks on colleagues at Bell Labs.
Kernighan recalled Ritchie as being “private, kind, and extremely funny.”
“I saw lots of different facets [of him] but all fundamentally centered around work as opposed to social life,” Kernighan said. “He was not a party kind of guy, but he definitely was incredibly good to work with. He had a wonderful dry sense of humor that showed up very frequently.”
During his college years and throughout his life, Ritchie is fondly remembered as quiet, kind, and highly intelligent.
Seltzer met Ritchie when she was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I was fairly close with the people who developed Berkeley Unix, and we all hung out with Dennis and the Bell Labs folks at conferences,” Seltzer said. “He was a very quiet and modest person with a wonderful, warm demeanor, and a great sense of humor.”
Harvard physics professor Paul Horowitz ’65 went to high school with Ritchie and stayed with Ritchie and his College roommates during what the newly admitted students visiting weekend, what is now called “Visitas.”
“I remember him being a nice guy who put me up for a couple of nights,” Horowitz said. “He’s a computer guru.”
Other than being a computer whiz, Ritchie was also widely read, interested in classical music, and was quite knowledgeable on a broad range of topics.
Seltzer recalled a trip to the San Diego Zoo with Ritchie and several other people.
“Dennis knew an exorbitant amount of information about naked mole rats,” Seltzer said, laughing. “[He explained that] naked mole rats are colony animals, just like ants.”
Kernighan described Ritchie as the type who wore jeans—specifically, black jeans. He also wore a t-shirt or a polo shirt with alternating stripes.
“All of us were creatures of habit,” Kernighan said. “We disliked dressing up.”
Kernighan remembers an instance when both he and Ritchie had to provide photographs of themselves for a PR type of publication that the two had authored a paper for.
“The publishers of this in house propaganda stuff basically sent it back and said there’s something wrong with these photos, would you mind sending them in again and asked if we would mind wearing ties,” Kernighan said.
Kernighan and Ritchie refused to retake their pictures with ties. “They used the tieless pictures,” he said.
Kernighan said that though Ritchie is gone, his colleague’s legacy is everywhere.
“Dennis’s legacy is the stuff that makes it work. The operating system, the Internet, phone system, all of that system is written in C...and that’s Dennis’s legacy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Ellen H. Goodman ’63 was a student at Radcliffe College, she did not have any female teachers. Radcliffe students had curfews, rules that prohibited closed doors when male Harvard students were in their dorms, and a possibly mythical but widely rumored “one foot on the floor” rule for both parties.
But Goodman, who would graduate from Radcliffe and enter the workforce during a time of political and social change, came to write extensively about these inequalities and the position of women in society during her career in journalism. A Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, Goodman continues what she describes as maintaining about gender relations in culture in retirement.
FUELED BY PASSION
“Thank goodness it’s hard for people like you to imagine what it was like,” said Suzanne Braun Levine ’63, a former classmate of Goodman’s and a recent friend and colleague. She, like Goodman, has written about the experience of women in her generation. Levine was the first editor of Ms. magazine before becoming the first female editor of the Columbia Journalism Review. In their work, both Levine and Goodman have emphasized the path that social movements have taken as writers and speakers have nudged public opinion towards progressive policies.
Levine and Goodman acknowledge that they attended the College during a period of change. But although women beginning to be accepted to graduate schools and being offered Harvard College degrees--as opposed to only Radcliffe--at commencement, Goodman said that the opportunities for women were just not there at the College.
“The Crimson didn’t have any women on its staff,” Goodman said. “I hate to sound like that—it really does sound like I walked through miles of snow to school... but everything changed very soon after that.”
When Goodman entered the workforce, she explained that writing positions were not open to women. Instead, she because a researcher at Newsweek magazine. The summer of 1963 saw Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington. It was only in 1964, a year after Goodman’s graduation, that the laws began to change, ushering in new conversations and standards about gender and race in the workplace—in July of 1964, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which prohibited segregation and discrimination based on race or gender.
In 1965, Goodman became a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, and in 1967, she began writing columns for the The Boston Globe.
Goodman’s reporting on the state of gender equality and social change movements earned her a position as a syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group in 1976 and the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Commentary in 1980.
“I think [her writing is] terrific, and I think she’s very savvy,” said Judith Dollenmayor ’63, a former classmate of Goodman’s and current associate director of Corporate, Foundation, and Government Relations at Vassar College. “She’s been a staunch feminist since the late 70s.”
In much of her recent writing, Goodman has looked back on four decades of change. When Goodman graduated in 1963, the 50th reunion class was the Class of 1913. Those women did not even have the right to vote, and according to Goodman, many were suffragists.
KEEPING THE CONVERSATION
In her later columns, articles, and commentary on talk shows—whether she was picking apart Palin’s political choices or criticizing the conservative platform’s failure to address global warming—Goodman maintained a liberal, witty, and intelligent voice.
“Practically everywhere along the line I would come across Ellen’s work, and I would quote it,” Levine said.
In 1973 Goodman returned to Harvard as a Nieman Fellow to study the dynamics of social change. She published a book on women’s changing roles in family life called “Turning Points,” and in 1999 became a Writer in Residence at Harvard, during which time she co-authored a book with Patricia O’Brien about women’s friendships.
Goodman said that there is still work to be done in terms of making the workplace and home life equal for all genders, such as making caregiving easier and encouraging women to pursue more rigorous careers.
“The women’s movement was always going to work in two parts,” Goodman said. “With one part we’d break open the doors that were closed to women, and with the other part we’d walk through, transforming society for men and women. Turns out it was a lot easier to open the doors.”
Despite her retirement, Goodman continues to make change. She founded The Conversation Project in 2010, a public engagement campaign that encourages families and loved ones to talk about end-of-life plans.
Looking back on her years at Radcliffe, Goodman said she enjoyed her classes in the history department and had fun attending musicals and other social events. She jokingly said she remembers a handful of facts and a handful of people.
“I don’t know if this is going to be depressing or not, but these will not be the best four years of your life,” she said. “I promise you—it gets better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Betty J. Diener was one of the first women to graduate from Harvard Business School, earning her diploma in 1964. But she first heard of “feminism” after she left the school’s Allston campus:
“I remember, probably in about 1965 or 1966, going to a presentation by one of the women’s magazines. They were saying that they thought feminism would be the big topic in the next 10 years,” Diener said. “And none of us had ever heard of it.”
Diener was on campus during a time of change for women across the University. Women were confined to living in the Radcliffe Quadrangle but attended classes in the Yard with male students. 1963, At the undergraduate level, Radcliffe students were given the option of having “Harvard College” printed on their diploma, instead of just the default, “Radcliffe College.”
But by 1963, most graduate schools had or were beginning to accept women. Eight women were accepted to the Harvard Business School’s full two-year MBA program for the first time as a part of the Class of 1965. Sixteen women graduated that year from the Law School. And in 1963, the Radcliffe Graduate School closed and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences began accepting women.
But Diener and many of her peers at graduate schools at the time say it was too early and their numbers too few to overcome or challenge the hegemony of the male-dominated academic community. The carefully selected and amply qualified first guard of women entering the graduate schools, however, did not view themselves at the time as feminist pioneers, instead focused on their own studies and success.
FOCUSED YET SEGREGATED
“In going back to reunions, most of the guys think I’m there because of my husband,” said Janey G. Lack, a 1964 graduate of the Business School. “Some people didn’t even know there were women on the campus.”
In spite of Harvard women’s monumental achievements in the early 60s, there were “just too few [women] to make any difference in the societal environment that we were in,” Diener said.
“Women’s empowerment was something they were talking about back then, but I certainly wasn’t looking at it as women empowerment,” said Judy L. Allen, a 1963 graduate of the Business School. “I was looking at it as though I was going to get the best education I could possibly get, so that I could get the best job I could get, until I got married. And that’s what was in my mind back then.”
“We were barrier-breakers, but none of us were climbing the barricades or waving their bras or anything like that. We were just very focused,” Diener said.
At campuses across the University, female students had similar sentiments. Despite the addition of the Harvard name on Radcliffe students’ diplomas, the lives of female students were not greatly affected while still on campus.
Jill A. Kennedy ’63 remembers walking from the Radcliffe Quad to Harvard Yard, even in the cold winter months, wearing a skirt--the uniform required of all Radcliffe students.
“As soon as they had the men up in the Quad, they got shuttles,” she said. Though she remembers it humorously now, she said it irked her at the time.
Radcliffe women were forbidden to enter Lamont Library, as they might “upset the gentlemen’s concentration,” said Judith A. Dollenmayer ’63. She also remembered having to bring bagged lunches to school every day and being required to eat separately from her male peers.
At the Graduate School of Education and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the situation was not much different. Sybil R. Pollet, a 1964 graduate of the Ed School, said that, even though her program consisted mostly of women, the feminist movement did not truly begin until a few years later.
“1963 was too early for a widespread sense of empowerment. I wish there had been more of a sense of empowerment, I wish we had talked more and prepared more for what would happen after we graduated,” she said, citing the hardships that women still faced in the workplace.
Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique, a book that propelled the feminist movement for equality, was published in 1963. However, it took longer than that to reach Harvard’s campus on a larger scale. It did not have a visible presence on campus, and neither did the roots of the feminist wave it sparked.
“We didn’t have a language to express our discontent,” Dollenmayer said.
BLAZING THE TRAIL
By the early 60s, both the Medical School and the Law School had been accepting women for over a decade. The Business School, however, did not accept women into its full two-year program until 1963.
Before the Harvard Business School was open to women, Radcliffe students were allowed to participate in the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration, with the same professors and case studies as their male counterparts across the Charles.
Beginning in 1959, women from the program could apply to attend the Business School for their second year and receive a MBA from Harvard. In 1963, the first eight women were accepted into the full MBA program.
Business School graduates of the Class of 1964 credited this achievement to their hard work and dedication during their time in the program.
“My HRPBA class absolutely closed down the HRPBA program and put women on the campus,” Lack said.
Allen agreed that her own class greatly influenced the situation. “Because we did well, they allowed women to be admitted into the first two-year class for the HBS,” Allen said, referencing their academic and social achievements.
In 1960, three women received Harvard MBAs with the new ability to complete the first-year at Radcliffe and their second-year across the Charles. In 1965, the number had increased to 11. Many women said they felt that they were paving the way for future generations of female students.
“I felt a great responsibility to do very well, to show the administration that we were absolutely as good as the guys,” Allen said. “But it wasn’t a big thing across my chest...you always wanted to do your best.”
Though some women believed that men felt “threatened” by their presence, they never let themselves feel subordinate to their male peer and professors.
“I don’t have the type of personality that was going to let them make me feel inferior,” said Caryl R. MacLaughlin, a 1985 graduate of the Business School. “I don’t know about the other women, but I was interviewed in person. I’m pretty sure that for them to go ahead and start this experiment, I would assume that they were very careful about who they accepted.”
EMPOWERED FOR THE FUTURE
In carefully picking the first classes of women to matriculate at many graduate schools, Harvard created a powerful group of women who would go on to succeed in a variety of fields. However, many women have only realized this after much reflection.
“If you had asked me in 1963 when I went to Harvard, or in 1964, if Betty Friedan and all that full array of women and their voices were important to me, then personally, I probably would have shrugged my shoulders and said, ‘I don’t think so,’” Lack said.
However, Lack said that she now looks back and sees that these forces must have had some impact with the issue of putting women on campus.
“We were really accomplished. We have all have done extraordinarily well, and I’m so proud of my own path,” said Lack, speaking about herself and her female classmates. “I’ve been empowered by [my education], but I don’t know that there was a sense of empowerment at the time.”
Even though Lack said she believes that the real women’s revolution came after she graduated, Kennedy felt that there was a sense of individual empowerment in many female students, more so than at other institutions.
“[My female classmates] had a sense that they were going to do things,” she said. “They were there to be educated.”
Others believed themselves to be in the minority when it came to desiring independence from social norms.
“I don’t think that many women I knew at Harvard felt the need to be empowered. We had roles created by our family background and society. I never followed those rules,” Pollet said. “I struggled to break barriers.”
Graduates of the Class of 1963 were a part a growth in the number of degrees conferred to women across the University and the addition of the Harvard name may have opened doors, but these opportunities were not realized until much later-and some have yet to be achieved.
“In retrospect, there’s been a lot of rewriting of history as though Harvard were a really feminist place in the early 60s,” Dollenmayer said. “There’s still a lot of work to do today, in my opinion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Freshman Seminar is a standard phrase in Harvard College vernacular today and an experience shared by many students freshman year. But to the Class of 1963, the concept was a new option for their first-year course load.
Incoming students in the fall of 1959—the Class of 1963—could apply to be placed in one of about 20 seminars offered that year, when the “Freshman Seminar Program” was first coined. These small-sized classes initially drew criticism from faculty and students but drove an innovative change in the focus and direction of the traditional Harvard education that has since remained a staple of the Harvard undergraduate experience.
FIRST-YEAR CONCERN
The desire for freshman seminars arose from a feeling that a student’s first year at Harvard could be improved by keeping students more engaged and involved with their studies. “Many of us have felt a continuing need to find new ways of sustaining the excitement these people have when they come to Harvard,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences McGeorge Bundy told The Crimson in 1959.  “The Faculty is an exciting faculty, but it is often research-minded. The need, then, is to connect freshman excitement with faculty excitement,” he added, stressing the importance of high-quality undergraduate teaching.
Not all professors of the time were in support of the program, however. Leonard K. Nash ’39, a professor of chemistry, was skeptical that the University would be able to afford small group instruction with so few students per seminar.
However, financing the project was not an issue for the University. During the planning stages of the seminar program in the spring of 1959, an anonymous Harvard alumnus chose to donate to the program due to his dissatisfaction with his own freshman experience at Harvard. This donation allowed the program’s organizers, including the Office of Advanced Standing and a faculty committee, to ensure that seminars could be shaped around the idea of limited enrollment.
Nash also questioned the maturity of Harvard students--especially first-years--and expressed skepticism of small sections in general.
Referencing a one-on-one conference option he had given his students on a final term paper, Nash illustrated a lack of student engagement. “Out of about 10 students only five ever showed up, and many probably didn’t begin preparation until the day before it was due,” he said.
There was also concern that the satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading policy of freshman seminars would lead to apathy on the part of students.
“It’s a way for students to get to know other students and to explore a topic without the pressure of grades,” said English professor Louis Menand.
While many students at the time chose not to participate in the program, those who did had mixed feelings.
“[The seminar] could have been a lot better if the graduate teaching assistant was more interested [in the material],” said Edward J. Miller ’63. “He didn’t have the gravitas of a professor.”
Despite the fact that he did well academically in the seminar, Miller felt that the graduate student did not provide enough helpful feedback on assignments, especially when students were given the task of reviewing the play “Oedipus Rex.”
However, Miller acknowledged that others, including his own roommate, found their seminars to be much more exciting. “He talked about it all the time,” Miller said.
A NEW VISION
Today, the freshman seminar program is not exceedingly competitive. In the 2011-2012 school year, over 1300 students enrolled in a seminar. Although freshman may not always receive their first choice of seminars, many open spots are available after the initial placement of students.
However, this was not the case in the fall of 1959. About a quarter of the incoming class chose to apply to 22 seminars outlined in a catalogue sent to freshman before the start of the semester. This pool was nearly twice the amount expected, prompting Director of the Office of Advanced Standing Edward T. Wilcox to consider increasing the size of the individual seminars to meet demand.
While more than 400 students wanted to participate, just 160 freshman were chosen to be part of the seminars to ensure that each seminar consisted of no more than 12 students.
The purpose of the seminars, from the perspective of professors and administrators, has remained consistent since the program’s inception.
“Its purpose from the beginning has been to introduce students to new disciplines and areas of study in a discussion-based, small-group instructional setting under the expert guidance of a faculty member,” said Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, current director of the Freshman Seminar Program.
The seminars currently provide a unique learning opportunity that differs from that of standard concentration courses as well as those in the General Education program.
“These are not department courses or intro courses. They’re not really related to the Gen Ed requirements [either],” Menand said.
The seminar program followed the idea of the Gen Ed curriculum, first proposed in 1946, which allowed students to discover new fields of study that they may have not otherwise found.
“Like Gen Ed courses, freshman seminars can offer a wonderful introduction to a new field of study in an area outside of a student’s current academic interests or intended field of concentration,” Naddaff said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Harvard Law School Erwin N. Griswold hosted the 16 women admitted to the Class of 1963 in his home in the fall of 1960. Over tea, he welcomed them and expressed excitement in having the women represented in the class he had helped pick.
“But I can’t for the life of me figure out what you’ll be doing when you graduate,” one of the female students, Siegrun Dinklage Kane, remembered him saying, referencing the male-dominated law profession.
Janet Reno was one of the students in Griswold’s study that day, a member of the Law School Class of 1963. In less than three decades, Reno would become the most powerful attorney in the nation, serving as former President Bill Clinton’s Attorney General for seven years.
Reno, who cites Griswold and her Harvard professors as inspiration and mentors in her legal career, graduated near the top of her class three years after the tea in the dean’s house. Friends and classmates say that the intellect, grounded nature, and drive which defined Reno’s career in public service began long before she entered the workforce.
STANDING TALL
Remembering her first day of law school, Reno said in an interview with the New York Times in 1994, “I don’t think I’ve ever felt so lost as I did then,”
That week, in the first day of a torts class, Michael S. Yesley ’63 remembers that the professor—who employed a “traditional mode” of pedagogy—called on Reno.
“[The professor] called on [Reno] first to recite a case and then answer questions about it using the usual Socratic method of the Law School,” Yesley says. “He gave her a real hard time, but she was very matter of fact and held up under the barrage of questions.”
But Reno was used to questioning and debate. Born in Miami in July 1938 as the daughter of two investigative reporters, Reno was a debate champion and valedictorian of her high school. She majored in chemistry at Cornell and served as the president of the Women’s Self-Government Association. Immediately following her graduation in 1960, she enrolled at the Law School.
As a student at the Law School, Reno lived off campus, spending one year with a professor and his family, according to Paul Anderson’s biography of Reno. She was “known to take long, solitary walks through historic neighborhoods and cemeteries,” Anderson wrote.
Reno commented for the biography that a talk she attended at Memorial Hall given by Eleanor Roosevelt would stay with her “as love as I live.”
Reno’s presence at the Law School was remembered by many of classmates, whether they had classes with her or not. Standing at 6’1” “she was tall…so she definitely stood out,” Neil L. Chayet, former classmate of Reno’s, said.
BEYOND LADIES’ DAY
When Reno was a student at the Law School, there was only one women’s bathroom on the campus, found in the basement of Austin Hall. Professor W.  Barton Leach ’21, who joined the Law School faculty in 1929, did not allow women to speak in class, saying their voices “were not powerful enough to be heard,” according to Charles Nesson, a former classmate of Reno’s, quoted in Anderson’s biography.
Instead, Reno’s classmate Siegrun Dinklage Kane said, Leach had an annual “Ladies’ Day.”
“The three or so women that were in that section would get up, and theoretically run the class. And [Leach] would sit in the front row and smirk while we ran the class—or tried to.” Kane said.
Nesson said Leach would sit in the back of the class with the male students, questioning the women in the front.
“We sat through that and laughed, without the thought ever occurring to us that something totally wrong was happening,” Nesson said. “It had to have had some powerful effects on [Reno] and the others.”
Reno had no trouble making her voice heard, according to her peers.
“She certainly stands as a role model,” Yesley said. “And it’s not just because she did it, but I think she has a strong personality and in part it may be because she’s taller than most of the guys that she might be arguing with.”
Yesley added that he and his male peers had “admiration” for Reno and her fellow female classmates who “were brave enough to enter what at the time was essentially a man’s world.”
Despite discrimination of women, Kane said that they had a platform in both the Law School community and the professional world because they were largely anomalies.
“I always felt that being a woman was an asset because people, whether they thought you should or shouldn’t be there, they paid attention. When you walked down the aisle everybody wanted to know, what is she going to say and how is she going to say it,” Kane recalled of her experiences post-law school.
A STRAIGHT ARROW
Following graduation, Reno returned to Miami. After spending a little less than a decade in private practice, Reno built a career as a state attorney prosecuting child abusers. In 1993, Clinton nominated Reno as Attorney General, a post she would be confirmed for, making her the first woman to have the position. Reno served until the end of his presidency, making her the longest-serving Attorney General since 1829.
A month after her confirmation, Reno approved the use of tear gas in an FBI raid of a religious cult’s barricade in Texas following the alleged violation of the federal firearms laws. The ensuing raid lead to a 51-day siege and an eventual fire resulting in over 80 deaths. The “Waco massacre” became a major source of controversy and criticism for Reno.
Despite criticism, the New York Times’ David Johnson praised Reno’s continued advocacy for underrepresented groups in her tenure at the Justice Department.
“In a period when crime rates have been falling, Ms. Reno has been an advocate for law enforcement and measures against youth violence and violence against women,” Johnson wrote.
As Kane recalled, Reno always pursued her own sense of direction.
“When Janet Reno was at the Attorney General’s office she got a lot of criticism for certain things and my feeling was, Janet was a straight arrow from the time she walked into the Law School, until the time she walked out of the Attorney General’s office,” Kane said.
Kane said she saw Reno as someone who was not going to play the politics.
“She wasn’t going to do something because somebody was lobbying her for whatever reason,” Kane said. “She was going to do what she thought was the right thing and the best thing and I think she did that for certainly her entire career at the Attorney General’s office.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the early 1960’s, the administration of hallucinogenic drugs to students by lecturer Timothy F. Leary and assistant professor Richard Alpert, now known as Ram Dass, garnered national media attention.
While the administration of LSD to graduate students did not violate University policy or state or federal law at the time, members of the Center for Research in Personality—the department in which Leary worked—disputed Dass and Leary’s right to continue experiments with psilobycin, a drug that creates a similar hallucinogenic experience to that created by LSD.
Much of the 1962 controversy centered around Dass and Leary’s refusal to explain to their subjects what they might expect from their drug-induced experiences, which Leary said at the time would be “imposing effects and directing the experience.” 
Although the 1962 sparked debate around the country, faculty said the event was an isolated incident that did not severely affect Harvard’s research programs.
MEETING THE MEN
From the beginning, Harvard professor Herbert C. Kelman recalled, Leary was a revolutionary in the field of psychology.
“I knew about him before from his earlier work,” said Kelman, who is a professor emeritus of social ethics. “However, it became obvious he had gone through some kind of transition... He had become a bit Messianic and had all these ideas about how the field was being done the wrong way.”
By the time that Leary arrived to Harvard, he had already begun experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs. He first used psilocybin in the summer of 1960 and he and Dass began to use hallucinogenic substances for his research, using his graduate students as test subjects.
Kelman, who was in Norway when Leary arrived, found out about the experiments through his students.
“Students had mailed me and there were hints about drugs and drug-taking,” Kelman said.
When Kelman returned to campus in the spring of 1962, he raised the issue at department meetings, However, David McClelland, former director of the Center for Research in Personality, chair of the Department of Social Relations, and good friends with Dass and Leary, did not follow up on the topic.
PLAYING WITH MUSHROOMS
It was only when a student enrolled in the class approached Kelman personally that he began to investigate the matter more thoroughly.
“[The student] was so cautious in the way that he talked about it,” Kelman said.
“He told me that students in the course were pressured to participate in drug sections...This had become so legitimized in the eyes of the students that they felt pressured to do it.”
Psychology professor Robert Rosenthal, who arrived immediately after Leary’s departure from the University in 1963, said that Leary was the source of the majority of the experimentation.
“He more or less made it a requirement to do psilocybin,” Rosenthal said. “We regarded it as kind of shocking that he got away with as much as he got away with.”
When Kelman discovered that Leary and Dass were distributing hallucinogenic drugs to their students, he raised the issue with McClelland. As the research became more publicized, Kelman said that other students began speaking up.
“One was telling me about a very bad trip she had,” Kelman said. “After taking it, she was almost at the point of jumping out of the window.”
ENDING THE TRIP
After listening to Kelman, McClelland scheduled a faculty meeting to discuss the issue. At the packed meeting, both McClelland and Kelman spoke against the practice, initially trying only “to remove the aura of legitimacy” from the research, Kelman said. McClelland told students that the research could hurt them later in their career, both as students and as teachers.
After the meeting, Leary stopped showing up to his classes. His contract was not renewed for the following year. Dass, who Kelman said was on track for a tenure appointment before the drug incidents, was fired in 1963 after it was revealed that he had broken University policy by giving drugs to an undergraduate.
RETURN TO NORMALCY
Although Leary left Harvard, hallucinogenic experimentation on campus continued. Lisa Bieberman ’63 was found guilty of mailing sugar cubes with trace amounts of the substance.  In the fall of 1962, the Food and Drug Administration began an investigation specifically targeted at psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline, the latter two of which provided similar hallucinogenic experiences to those of psilocybin.
However, while students may have continued to explore hallucinogenic substances outside the classroom, formal experimentation with hallucinogenics ceased after Leary and Dass’s departures.
Rosenthal said that Leary’s research was treated with disdain by the students he taught in the department’s clinical program.
“For three or four or five years later, people would still make references to his work,” Rosenthal said. “Nobody took his experiments as serious science.”
Rosenthal took over teaching the introductory and psychotherapy courses for graduate students. He said that little changed from Leary’s original course syllabus, but he made sure to remove the psilocybin.
“I taught the same course that he taught, and this was a course that had nothing to do with drugs,” Rosenthal said. “It was really far-fetched for Leary to bring that into what he was teaching but when he left we didn’t change anything.”
In fact, Rosenthal said that the Psychology department was affected very little by Leary’s departure.
“Harvard was a hands-off enough place,” he said. “I can’t imagine anyone’s research was affected.”
Furthermore, Rosenthal said that Dass and Leary’s experiments with psilocybin were an entirely isolated incident.
“I didn’t see anything that was even remotely questionable [in others’ research],” Rosenthal said. “I think what was upsetting to people was that he made it a part of his teaching.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the morning of Wednesday, November 7, 1962, one might have expected the Editorial Board of The Harvard Crimson to strike a celebratory tone. It did not. The night before, Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ‘54-’56 had been elected to the U.S. Senate, and though it had supported the ascension of President John F. Kennedy ‘40, the Editorial Board was not at all happy to see youngest Kennedy brother bound for Capitol Hill.
Accusing Kennedy of using his name and wealth to get elected, doing a disservice to voters by not engaging in meaningful debate with his opponents, and being generally unworthy of his new seat, The Crimson was harsh on November 7. “It is with the severest pessimism that we now regard [Ted Kennedy’s] ascendancy,” the board concluded.
Though Kennedy would eventually earn respect and support on campus—The Crimson endorsed Kennedy for reelection in 1964—sentiment on campus supported fellow Democrat Edward J. McCormack in the primary and Republican opponent George Cabot Lodge ’50 in the special election, viewing Kennedy as unqualified and riding the coattails of his presidential brother.
A FRUSTRATED CAMPUS
Kennedy in 1962 was seeking the same U.S. Senate seat his brother had held from 1953 until 1960. Running on his brother’s platform, Ted also used John’s original campaign slogan: “He Can Do More for Massachusetts.”
But while the elder Kennedy filled White House offices with Harvard professors, administrators, and graduates—a community that had been enormously supportive of his presidential bid—the younger Kennedy struggled to find support on the campus that both brothers had called home.
According to many students who attended Harvard in 1962, Ted was widely perceived as a man looking to inherit, rather than earn, his place in the Senate. Though Kennedy won the seat in November’s special election with 55 percent of the vote, he came in a distant third in an October poll of Harvard and Rafcliffe students with only 36 percent.
“Teddy was seen as an oafish younger brother with no credentials trading totally on his brother’s success,” Steven V. Roberts ’63, a former Crimson news editor who contributed to The Crimson’s coverage of Kennedy’s senate campaign, wrote in an email.
Kennedy’s reputation on campus as ill-credentialed was not helped by the emergence of information about his academic career at the College.
Sixty years before about 70 students were forced to withdraw from the College for cheating on a take-home exam in Government 1310: “Intro to Congress,” the future Senator Kennedy was asked to leave campus for cheating on a Spanish exam. Kennedy had paid the roommate of a fellow football player to take a Spanish exam under his name. Minutes after the exam ended, Kennedy received a call from the College informing him he would be suspended immediately. After spending two years in the military, Ted returned to the school and graduated in 1956—six years after he took up residence in Wigglesworth in the fall of 1950.
When he launched his senate campaign in early 1962, Kennedy sought to keep the cheating issue under wraps.
Still, the story gained traction in the media after The Boston Globe broke it on March 30. The Crimson Review, a precursor to Fifteen Minutes magazine, featured the scandal prominently in a profile that ran shortly before election day.
But the cheating incident was not the only factor behind the budding senator’s negative reception at Harvard.
“I remember hearing about it, but I can’t fairly say how prevalent that was,” said Todd A. Gitlin ’63, former president of Tocsin, a campus group seeking to promote a more liberal foreign policy and to ban the atomic weapon.
Instead, Gitlin said, rejection of Kennedy grew along with discontent with his brother’s actions as president, particularly his aggressive diplomacy. Highlights of the elder Kennedy’s early foreign policy included a futile invasion of Cuba in 1961 and a barely-averted nuclear crisis in October of 1962.
Both events hurt the president’s support at Harvard. Gitlin said that Kennedy “had lost his glow” in the eyes of campus Democrats.
As frustration grew, so did left-wing groups like Tocsin, which had been promoting more liberal foreign policy since Kennedy’s inauguration and began to organize protests and demonstrations, according to Gitlin.
“There were many protest rallies,” said Gitlin of the campus after the events in Cuba. “We filled Emerson D with 300 people...we could do that very quickly.”
Thus, at least within the gates of Harvard Yard, Ted was hitching his wagon to a president whose popularity was waning. As the September 18 primary approached, major segments of the Harvard community declared support for McCormack, Kennedy’s opponent and the state’s attorney general.
In McCormack’s camp was a group of professors, led by Mark DeWolfe Howe ’28 of Harvard Law School. Howe’s group was soon joined by the Young Democratic Club of Harvard College, despite the fact that the Young Dems were, according to students and the club’s actions, a group of relatively moderate Democrats.
“Many of us thought that Ted Kennedy had no qualifications for the office and no relevant experience,” remembered Henry F. Greene ’63, former president of the Young Democrats, adding that the group was impressed with McCormack’s more progressive platform. Echoing his peers, Greene added that Kennedy “was a viable candidate only by virtue of being the president’s brother.”
A MAN AND HIS LEGACY
While on November 7 the Editorial Board of The Crimson lamented that Kennedy would not be a “thoughtful, independent voice in the senate” or a “representative who comprehends the magnitude of civil rights, civil liberties, and unemployment problems facing America,” Ted would become the fourth-longest serving senator and an icon of progressivism.
He provided influential support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which had been proposed by his brother, the President, before he had been assassinated—and, among other things, went on to be the Senate’s champion of education and health care reform.
In 1964, The Crimson Editorial Board endorsed Kennedy for reelection. Former opponents of Ted’s senate campaign acknowledged that they later supported his tenure.
“For what it’s worth, I have increasingly thought over the years that few events in American campus politics have ever so dramatically proven how wrong a campus politician can be in thinking he or she knows much about our politics,” Greene, the former president of the Young Dems, wrote in an email. “I have come to very much regret my opposition to Ted Kennedy’s election in 1962, just as I have simultaneously come to think he was one of the greatest Senators in our history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It started with a ukulele. Tom Rush ’63-64 was ten when his cousin Beau taught him how to play. Rush says that his prior five years of piano lessons had been torture, but on the ukulele, he had fun. Soon, Rush graduated to the baritone ukulele, an instrument that “felt pretty manly” compared to its predecessor, and before long he was strumming a guitar.
Taking classes in the Yard by day and playing venues and coffeehouses in the Square by night, Rush launched a successful career during his undergraduate years at Harvard. A force on Harvard’s bustling folk scene, Rush would become an important figure in folk revival in 1960s and 70s.
TROLLING THE HOOTENANNIES
Rush’s love of music quickly translated into performance. During his years at Groton School, Rush used his ukulele to do imitations of Elvis and other popular musicians of the day.
“He had the hair for it, too,” remembers Phil Tilney ’63, Rush’s Harvard roommate of three years and a fellow Groton classmate.
Born in 1941 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Rush’s father worked at St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire. While Rush imitated popular musicians at Groton, Rush’s musical interest turned to folk when he arrived at Harvard in 1959.
“When I got to Cambridge, it was a hotbed of folk music,” Rush remembers.
While at Harvard, Rush majored in English and hosted a folk show on WHRB, Harvard’s radio station, called “Balladeers.” The show lasted for 30 minutes on Tuesdays, and hosting the program required Rush to find guests to perform live on the air.
“I started trolling the hootenannies to find guests for the show,” Rush recalls. The hootenannies were folk music parties that included an open mic component. In frequenting local hootenannies, Rush learned that he could get admitted to performances for free if he had a guitar with him. He could even get in for free with an empty guitar case.
FLAGSHIP OF FOLK
Rush spent the summer after his freshman year performing on the streets of Paris, which Tilney believes gave him the confidence to start performing at venues regularly when he came back to Cambridge.
“Between The Unicorn, The Golden Manatee, Café Yana, and Club 47 one could get three to four gigs a week if he was popular, and Tom was popular,” recounts Betsy Siggins who ran Club 47 when Tom performed there. Club 47, now Club Passim, is in a basement on Palmer Street, near what is now LF Stores and across from the COOP.
“Tom was quite exceptional in the fact that he was a Harvard student first, and a folk musician second,” she says.
Rush felt that Club 47 was “the flagship of the fleet” of folk coffee houses, and he performed there on an almost weekly basis throughout his undergraduate years.
“The older generation would come here and play for the kids, and sometimes the kids would get a chance to play for them, too,” he said. This collaboration and exchange, passing down of music between the generations, continued to be an important part of Rush’s musical career and legacy.
THE FOLK CIRCLE
Rush took a year off after his junior fall to travel around the country and perform, and when he got his college degree in 1964 he had already recorded and released his albums “Tom Rush at the Unicorn” and “Got a Mind to Ramble.” In 1965, Rush signed with Elektra Records and continued performing at Boston coffee houses and other East Coast venues.
In 1966 Rush was performing on tour when he stopped at a music club in Detroit, the Chess Mate. That evening, a young woman asked the owner if she could do a guest set so that Rush could hear her sing. Her name was Joni Mitchell.
At that time, Rush was trying to compile songs for another album, so he asked Mitchell to send him a tape. The tape she sent included the song “The Circle Game,” and Rush liked the song so much that it became the title track of his next album. Released in 1968, “The Circle Game” also included covers of songs by James Taylor and Jackson Browne—two other artists that Rush helped popularize.
“I was at a point in my career when I didn’t know what to do next, then along came these three stunning songwriters at the same time,” Rush remembers, adding that he thinks their songwriting was critical to the album’s success.
“The Circle Game” also featured original songs, including his often-covered tune “No Regrets,” which has become a folk standard.
“[Rush] had a good ear for finding singer-songwriters,” says Todd Kwait, a filmmaker who is currently making a documentary about Tom Rush’s life. Kwait argues that Tom’s success hinged on his ability to cover many genres well, his handsome appearance—which Kwait describes as “the Harvard look but also the urban-cowboy type look”—and his ability to find fresh talent.
PLAYING IT FORWARD
In the early 1980s, Rush heard that Boston’s Symphony Hall went unused between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. So, in 1981, Rush decided to use that week to create a forum like Club 47 in Symphony Hall, one that would combine established folk artists and newer folk talent. The plan worked. Rush filled Symphony Hall in the week leading up to New Years for multiple nights, 8 years in a row until the space was unavailable.
But last year, for the first time in 30 years, Rush successfully launched a campaign to rent out Symphony Hall on Dec. 28 to throw a concert celebrating 50 years of performing.
Rush used Kickstarter—an online funding platform for creative projects—to raise more than the  $100,000 he needed to rent the hall in one week.
Kwait says this is typical of Rush, who always had a smart, business-minded approach to his music and was quick to adapt to new technologies like social media.
“Tom just turned 72 and here he is selling out symphony hall doing this huge concert,” says Tilney. “He’s still a wonderful performer and giving it 100 percent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Instead of sitting for final exams in the June of 1963, Harvard junior Peter I. de Lissovoy ’64 sat a table in Lester’s Grill in Atlanta, hoping not for an A, but that he would not be struck in the head with an axe-handle. He would return not to his room in Leverett Tower, but to an over-capacity prison cell.
De Lissovoy had hitchhiked from Cambridge to the Atlanta office of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, where he volunteered to assist in the civil rights movement. His services were readily welcomed and he was sent to sit-in at Lester’s Grill, owned by Lester G. Maddox—a restaurant owner who would go on to be elected governor of Georgia in 1966. Maddox was known to equip his white patrons with axe-handles with which they could beat protesters.
“Fortunately, they had run out of axe-handles,” De Lissovoy said. Arrested and jailed that day, he would become the 12-person cell’s 27th inmate.
“That was a big change, going from living in Leverett House to living in a cell,” he said.
That month, Theophilus E. “Bull” Connor would unleash police dogs and fire hoses on protesters in Birmingham, Alabama. Two months later, Martin Luther King Jr. would deliver his “I Have A Dream” address to hundreds of thousands from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
Inside and outside the gates of Harvard Yard, students responded to the emerging Civil Rights Movement. While some remember campus as an insular community that looked at the movement from afar, many black students within the school worked to create a sense of community, and individual and group efforts among both the student body and the administration emerged to support racial equality through activism at Harvard, in the local Cambridge and Boston area, and in the South.
BLACK AT HARVARD
For the first time in 1962 black students on campus--led by Aryee Quah “George” Armah ’63—acted to create a formal association of their own: the Association of African and Afro-American Students. Its stated goals were to promote a sophisticated conception of “Black Power,” which included frequent discussions about integration.
The club wrote a six-page letter to the administration in December 1963 asking for University recognition, but was denied because of its admission policy. According to the charter, admission would be “open to African and Afro-American students currently enrolled at Harvard and Radcliffe.” Because it only accepted black members, school officials deemed this language too exclusionary and denied them status as an official student group. This decision was reversed a year later, after the AAAAS revised their policy.
But despite the creation of the AAAAS, students said that--because of the relatively small size of the black community and the difficulty of achieving acceptance to the College in the first place--black students were reluctant to challenge the status quo.
“Each of us was focused on getting to Harvard, which for many of us was a daunting challenge,” said Wilfred O. Easter Jr. ’63, a black student. “Civil rights pursuits were not my main goal. My parents would not have been happy.”
As a small minority within a predominantly white male student body, black students had been going to Harvard for nearly a century before AAAAS was formed. The College accepted its first black student in 1847, although a black student did not enroll until 1870. He, and those African American students following him, lived in housing relegated to black students until 1921. African American students were still assigned to the least desirable housing arrangements on a consistent basis until the Graduate School Council agreed to assign students at random in 1950.
Though black people outside the gates faced Jim Crow and forms of systematic racism and violence, the students say they found that they were enveloped in a mostly peaceful, accepting community.
Spencer C. Jourdain ’61, a black student whose father had initiated integrated housing in the 1920s, said that there was a distinct absence of overt prejudice on campus in his time at Harvard, but noted that others may have had different experiences.
“Even though I was not aware of any overt racism on campus, at our 50th reunion, some of my white friends mentioned that they were very aware of it, and
white students treated him with respect. In his experience, he said being African-American was met with curiosity more often than hostility.
“One day, I collected mail and went to the union to have lunch. I had a bunch of personal letters. Instead of sitting with a large group and discussion the meaning of life, I sat alone at a table to read my mail,” Easter said. “All of a sudden, someone asked if he could sit next to me. I agreed, and then he asked me if I wouldn’t mind talking to him. He was from North Dakota and had never seen a Negro [sic] before. We talked for hours, and became good friends after that. He even took me to my first hockey game,” he said.
SPEAKING UP
Though Harvard appeared to some to be a campus isolated from the violence and inequality that catalyzed the civil rights movement, echoes of the movement still rung throughout campus. With no one group or method of advocacy, many members of the Harvard community worked toward the same goal of equality in different ways.
In October 1962, Martin Luther King Jr. came to Harvard Law School, speaking about the inequalities that existed in the nation at large.
“We have come a long, long way in the fight for integration,” King told an audience at the Law School Forum. “But we have a long, long way to go. If democracy is to live, segregation must die.”
He went on to propose a series of steps—including federal action, nonviolence, and individual advocacy from African Americans themselves—that would advance the cause of nationwide integration.
Following King’s words and prescriptions, Harvard students and community members engaged in individual advocacy. In December 1962, a group of 45 Harvard and Radcliffe students joined the ranks of the Civil Rights Coordinating Committee. Together with volunteers from the greater Boston area, they assumed a mission of improving education, employment, and home-buying for the area’s African Americans.
Susan B. Jhirad ’64 became involved in the real estate facet of the group’s efforts. When persons of color had been refused by a realtor, white “testers” were subsequently sent to rent or purchase the same property. If the white clients were approved, then the group would enact appropriate legal proceedings set forth by a number of Massachusetts anti-discriminatory laws.
Tutoring programs were launched alongside boycotts of firms with discriminatory hiring practices.
In the spring of 1963, de Lissovoy stood in the servery in Leverett Dining Hall, collecting money for SNCC before he departed for Georgia. In six weeks, he raised $1400 from what he describes as a mostly supportive, yet inert, student body.
That money, which he personally delivered to one of the SNCC’s leaders, H. Julian Bond, paid for 127 activists to work a week each at the group’s set wage of $11 a week.
Behind the scenes, Harvard’s administration was led by progressive, though not necessarily outwardly vocal, supporters of civil rights. Former Dean of the College John U. Monro ’34, who spent 21 years at the College in various positions, quietly informed the liberal policies of the administration.
“Monro is the man most responsible for the College’s increased interest in enrolling men of color,” Easter said, adding that he believed that “he’s the voice that pushed the college into the 60s.”
In 1967, he would leave Harvard to take a teaching job at an unaccredited college outside of Birmingham, following his desire to improve equality in education across the country.
“We had Dean Monro, and he was fabulous,” Jourdain said. “He is a giant in my eyes because he just quietly did what’s right. Those are the people I call true Americans.”
OUTSIDE THE GATES
A month before the Class of 1963 graduated from the College, 200 Radcliffe and Harvard students marched from Cambridge across the river to Boston Common, joining 7,500 others in showing their solidarity with blacks protesting in Birmingham.
The summer of 1963 was a pivotal phase of the civil rights movement that would garner the organizers and cause national status, propelling the issue to the floor of Congress months later in October 1963. In the summer of 1963, Harvard students joined the national effort for racial equality, traveling and protesting throughout the nation.
The Fourth of July that summer was, for five Harvard students, celebrated with a gesture fitting of the holiday. They protested near Baltimore at an amusement park known as a hotbed of racial unrest. As they attempted to illicitly enter the park, they were arrested on charges of trespassing and jailed alongside other protesters on July 4.
“We also thought it was a most fitting way to spend July 4,” Steven H. Johnson ’64, one of the Harvard protesters, told The Crimson.
John W. Perdew ’64 left Cambridge for Georgia. While working with SNCC, he was arrested twice and received threatening phone calls. His incarceration prevented him from returning to Cambridge in the fall.
By the time school resumed that fall, the movement was becoming more immediate to the Harvard community. With students in jail, others who had spent time in the South, and some who participated in the March on Washington for Freedom and Jobs, the movement gained more prominence as a national and personal ordeal.
“These events were a factor in the University’s increased interest in the civil rights movement,” said S. Allan Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation. “Witnessing these things in 1963 changed my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cloudy Saturday afternoon in October 1962, fearful students filled the bleachers of Soldiers Field to watch a game against Dartmouth that could have meant the Ivy League title for the Crimson. But the students’ fear was not just for the College’s football legacy.
“I looked around [the stadium] and thought, ‘Gee this is scary,’ I wondered if we would have another game,’” Charles A. Stevenson ’63 said.
Six days earlier, President John F. Kennedy announced the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in an address to the nation. On the brink of nuclear war, students huddled together in common rooms and voiced concern at faculty-led discussions. A few left campus all-together, some wrote in journals. Most had faith in Kennedy, “the Harvard guy next door,” and others criticized his stance as too aggressive.
Students, however, reflect now that they did not know just how close the world had come to nuclear war.
MIXED FEELINGS
On Monday, October 22, 1962, students crowded around television sets to watch Kennedy’s speech on the situation, where he outlined initial steps to be taken, including a quarantine against Cuba.
“We will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth but neither will we shrink from that risk at any time it must be faced,” Kennedy said that night, leaving the nation wary of what could become of the crisis.
“There was a sense of unreality,” said Kenneth L. Freed ’63, who remembered watching the speech in a common room of Quincy House.
While previous generations had witnessed two world wars, students at the College had not been exposed to the reality of global warfare; American soldiers were positioned in Vietnam but had yet to engage in combat.
“It opened up a huge amount of conflict in American society. It shattered the basically calm and not-so-bad 50s environment in which we grew up,” Freed said.
Later that night, another student recalled the loud playing of Mozart’s Requiem as a group drank and contemplated Kennedy’s address before returning to their studies. Others were too intrigued that night to focus on their academics, like Stevenson, who wrote in his college journal: “Heard excellent Kennedy speech—I hope for the best.”
Todd A. Gitlin ’63, former president of Harvard’s anti-nuclear group, Tocsin, who would go on to serve as president of Students for a Democratic Society, said that some students were so agitated that they even left campus.
“People were getting into cars, leaving town, and going to Canada. People were critically upset about what was happening. It really did seem there was a live possibility of nuclear war,” Gitlin said.
OPENING DISCUSSION
Those who remained on campus witnessed student and faculty discussions on the issues at the hand.
The day after Kennedy’s address, over 300 students packed into Quincy House for a forum by government professor Henry A. Kissinger ’50 and associate professor of government Stanley H. Hoffman on the “Role of the United Nations in U.S. Foreign Policy.” But the majority of the discussion was driven by student questions on what was then called the “Cuban crisis,” as reported in The Crimson.
At the meeting, Kissinger and Hoffman openly expressed their opinions on what the Kennedy administration should do in the crisis and also provided context to the situation.
“There were a bunch of organized meetings where faculty spoke for or against [Kennedy’s action] and tried to explain what it was all about,” Freed said.
Each day, newspaper headlines revealed new actions by the Kennedy administration.
“As an onlooker I knew nothing more than what was in media and did have a sense of fear,” Stevenson said.
Tocsin seized the opportunity to educate students about the anti-nuclear effort. Gitlin said that Tocsin opposed the placement of missiles in Cuba but believed that that was not a legitimate reason to go to war.
“[Tocsin] wanted the Harvard-Radcliffe community to take seriously the risk of nuclear war,” Gitlin said. “We thought it was senseless and morally repellent to threaten mass destruction because there was a Communist government on an island in the Caribbean.”
Hampton P. Howell III ’63 recalled his first encounter with Tocsin activists in his freshman year, when he was confused by their rallies.
“I saw some people walking through the Yard with signs saying ‘End Nuclear War’, and I felt bad for them. They must not be good at sports and not have girlfriends because they didn’t have anything else to do,” Howell said.
Howell, who grew up in a small town in Long Island where he had not witnessed public demonstrations, said he later “learned differently” and became more aware of the possibility of nuclear warfare as the crisis manifested.
PRAISE FOR KENNEDY
The majority of students supported and praised Kennedy’s actions during the crisis.
“I thought he handled it brilliantly. That’s what a lot of people thought at time,” Freed said.  “[Kennedy] had the right balance between caution and resolve.”
The Young Democrats and the Young Republicans had sent telegrams to Washington, expressing their support of the blockade, according to The Crimson.
Stevenson said that he and his peers at Harvard felt an “enormous sense of pride” because Kennedy was a graduate of the College and had recruited several Harvard graduates and professors to his administration.
“We had the view that Kennedy was ‘the Harvard guy next door,’” Stevenson said.
Graham T. Allison ’62, a government professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, agreed that Kennedy “wisely resisted pressure to react quickly with a surprise air strike” and, by working out an agreement with the Soviets, “avoided escalating the crisis to nuclear war.”
Some students at the time  were more critical of Kennedy’s response to the crisis, however, many of whom were members of Tocsin.
Three days before the end of the crisis, Tocsin organized a rally to criticize U.S. policy toward Cuba in Lowell Lecture Hall that drew more than 2000 students, more than half of whom were turned away due to the lecture hall’s limited capacity. According to a Crimson article published the following day, the 900 eventual attendees listened on and cheered as professors like Tocsin’s faculty advisor H. Stuart Hughes denounced the Kennedy’s military actions, and the students almost unanimously passed a resolution against an American invasion of Cuba.
AVOIDING ARMAGEDDON
On October 28, 1962, Kennedy, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant reached a deal that would have Soviet missiles in Cuba brought back to the Soviet Union in exchange for a public vow by the U.S. to not invade Cuba, thus bringing the 13-day crisis to an end.
“Khrushchev capitulates—amazing but wonderful,” wrote Stevenson in his journal.
That day, several leaders of Tocsin were in Washington, where they had been picketing to rally opposition against the blockade of Cuba.
“When announcement of stand-down came, we drank a bunch,” said Gitlin.
Fifty years later, students reflect that they did not fully realize the weight of the situation at the time.
“We didn’t know how close the world had been to nuclear war,” Gitlin said.
He noted that only in the aftermath of what is now referred to as the “Cuban Missile Crisis” did historians understand the extent of the risk that the world would dissolve into a state of nuclear warfare.
“The Russians were within a hair’s breadth of launching a nuclear attack on a American aircraft carrier—this is now known to historians,” Gitlin said. “And the United States was very close to invading Cuba which would have precipitated a war response. So from several directions the world was really on the brink of nuclear war.”
Freed also realized that the risks of full-blown nuclear warfare were “much higher” than he perceived during his time at Harvard after he read articles on the topic years later.
“It was very sobering to me how I was so lucky [to survive],” he said, adding that he thinks that the legacy of the crisis is more significant than the dangers of the event itself. “It really marked a new world epic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will invest its soon-to-be-launched social choice fund into the Parnassus Equity Income Fund, the University announced in a press release on Thursday.
According to the press release, Parnassus was selected using a number of “investment and social criteria” for the fund, which will be officially created when Harvard’s new fiscal year begins on July 1.
The University announced the creation of the social choice fund in December after receiving pressure from students and alumni who advocated for socially responsible investing.
The December announcement also came after similar decisions made by other institutions, such as Brown University, which became the first Ivy League institution to create a social choice fund in 2007.
In its December press release, Harvard said that the fund would be invested in an outside mutual fund, but not by the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s $30 billion endowment.
The Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility—a subcommittee of the University’s highest governing body—decided on Parnassus with the help of HMC.
The press release said that HMC hired two undergraduates to help research and analyze various mutual funds to help the Company make a recommendation to the Corporation.
The Parnassus Equity Income Fund, a mutual fund operated by Parnassus Investments, is comprised of 75 percent dividend-paying equities and 25 percent non-dividend-paying equities.
“The Fund also takes environmental, social, and governance factors into account in making investment decisions,” according to the Parnassus website.
Responsible investing advocates said at the time of social fund’s announcement that they were pleased that Harvard was taking action, but that they hoped the social choice investments would be transparent.
Activists also added that they were pleased that there would be no minimum gift amount for the fund, but expressed concern that a large chunk of its initial value—20 percent—would be removed each year to pay for financial aid.
“This fund will offer donors another way to support Harvard’s financial aid program and the transformational opportunities it offers our students,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a December press release.
