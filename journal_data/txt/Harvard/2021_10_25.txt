After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Management Company returned 33.6 percent on its investments in fiscal year 2021, increasing Harvard’s endowment to its unprecedented total of $53.2 billion. While many celebrated these "tremendous returns," such gloating about the endowment’s financial success is an insult to the University’s consistently underpaid employees and ignores the harms incurred by Harvard’s unethical investing. This ostentatious praise for the endowment’s growth (which was already larger than half the world’s economies) is not only in poor taste, but also morally wrong.
Despite this monumental financial gain of over $11 billion this past year, the University continues to lower its budget allocated for essential workers, citing "continued financial pressure" due to the pandemic. Before the semester began, Harvard’s proposed new dining schedules threatened to cut the number of full-time dining employees by 20 percent, limiting their access to employee benefits and increasing their financial strain after an already trying year.
At the same time, Harvard is in the midst of negotiations with the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers whose proposals include a yearly increase in pay that is less than half the rate of inflation this past year, effectively lowering their real salaries. While University officials, like President Lawrence S. Bacow, have argued that “we have a legal and moral responsibility to maintain the purchasing power of that endowment so that it sustains future generations,” aren’t 33.6 percent gains a bit more than maintenance? Moreover, while much of the endowment is inaccessible, Harvard finished the past fiscal year with a budget surplus of over $283 million, showing that it has more than enough means to support its workers, whose reported wages and benefits decreased by $101 million over the same period. Meanwhile, last fiscal year, HMC’s top six officials together made over $31 million annually (this year’s financials have yet to be disclosed). Flaunting these exorbitant gains while simultaneously using austerity politics to limit worker compensation isn't impressive, it's embarrassing.
Furthermore, celebrating these financial gains is even more irresponsible when you consider the unethical sources of these returns. For example, Harvard’s endowment includes significantly more investments in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that profit off of the prison-industrial complex than University officials have previously admitted. Despite Harvard’s recent decision to divest from fossil fuels after nearly a decade of student activism, this past year’s gains still include “runoff mode” residual investments in unsustainable industries. Furthermore, as recently as 2018, Harvard’s endowment included $2 billion invested in the Baupost Group, a hedge fund that held bonds profiting from Puerto Rican debt until pressured to change its practices. And this is only the tip of the iceberg: Information on only two percent of Harvard’s investments is publicly available, meaning that the rest of the endowment is not publicly disclosed.
Harvard’s endowment investments also include illegitimate land purchases which are continuously mishandled, harming communities around the world. In Brazil’s Cerrado region, Harvard owns over $450 million worth of farmland found by the Brazilian government to be illegally taken from Indigenous communities. Harvard’s use of these illegitimately sequestered lands further contributes to the disenfranchisement of these peoples, as the HMC appears to harass local communities, contribute to deforestation, and heavily use pesticides and other chemicals which pollute local drinking water and have possibly lead to increased numbers of cancer patients. In Cuyama Valley, California, Harvard owns 7,500 acres of vineyards that sequester groundwater from drought-ridden nearby areas to increase profits at the expense of local communities, leading to grassroots organization against Harvard’s groundwater use.
Harvard’s immoral investment of endowment funds is nothing new. In the 1970s, Harvard held long-term bonds and certificates of deposit issued by banks which participated in direct loans to the South African apartheid government. Moreover, in the 1980s, at least $25 million of Harvard’s endowment portfolio was invested in tobacco stock, fueling an industry that today kills over 400,000 Americans annually. And, while University officials claim to have divested from these industries, public filings show that HMC actually still indirectly owns stock in tobacco companies.
So, instead of gloating about endowment gains, University officials should stop to reconsider where this money comes from, where it goes (or doesn’t go), and why they do not disclose this important information. As Harvard continues to invest its endowment in unethical holdings while simultaneously denying their workers’ sustainable wages, maybe growing the endowment isn’t something to be proud of. It’s something to be ashamed of.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Good news! If you have — given up trying to explain mechanism design to your problem set group while studying for midterms, argued with your significant other about the disproportionately low effort you feel they’re putting into the relationship, or trekked all the way to the Quad to meet a friend just to get a text saying the evening van just dropped them off at Eliot courtyard and they can’t wait to see you — lately, it’s not your fault. Mercury’s in retrograde.
You’ve probably heard someone offer these three undecipherable words as an explanation for anything that’s gone wrong in the last month. So what do they mean?
In astrology, Mercury is the planet of the mind. It rules thought and communication; it dictates how you learn and process information and how you spit that information back out to other people. It’s an everyday kind of planet, constantly moving in a tight circle around the Sun of you.
Mercury’s domain is amplified by college. As we go to classes and extracurricular activities and even the dining hall, we are always learning and growing from that newfound knowledge. We rub shoulders with so many fascinating people at Harvard: peers who have gone to the Olympics or won international science competitions, professors who wrote the book on the topic they teach, graduate students who are always juggling a million cooler things — research and dissertations and invitation-only conferences — and yet still make the time to mentor us. There’s a reason Mercury is the patron of schooling and education. We exercise our Mercuries day-in-day-out here, in casual conversations over brunch, debates in section, and deliverables for student organizations.
But quick, nimble Mercury is also a troublemaker, and three times a year, the planet appears to screech to a halt and start backpedalling across the sky. Of course, physics will tell you this is only an optical illusion from our vantage point on Earth: Mercury isn’t actually moving backwards. But it has this apparent retrograde — retrograde coming from the Latin “retro-,” meaning backwards, and “gradi,” meaning step — motion to us, and so we astrologers say Mercury is in retrograde.
When Mercury’s in retrograde, life is full of confusion, frustration, miscommunication, and blunders — even more so than usual. You make a point in section and there’s pin-drop silence as no one picks up what you put down. You accidentally reveal a secret you shouldn’t have. You sleep through lecture and email your mom instead of your professor about attending office hours. You screw up everything that you can screw up, and everything falls apart.
It’s easy to feel terribly small and alone during Mercury retrograde, like no one else understands what’s going on in our heads. Especially at Harvard, where many people’s first line of defence is a sharply polished intellect, these times where our minds are frazzled and words don’t come out right are unsettling. We’ve always prided ourselves on being able to verbalize and explain, to pinpoint the problem so we can adjust and catch up, and now this fundamental part of ourselves is scrambled just like Mercury’s apparent path in space.
But even as Mercury rebels, as mistakes quadruple and thoughts take a tumble, we are all trying our best. Learning is hard. Communicating is hard. Neither of these acts happens alone; they are two-way streets, with two people on opposite ends trying their hardest to understand each other and branch the chasm between them. When anything under the domain of Mercury — be it conveying one’s own thoughts or approaching others — fails, it’s not just one person’s fault. You can’t control how other people will interpret your words. You can only try your best to match those words to what’s happening in your mind, and trust that the other person is doing the same for you.
You won’t always feel like everyday life’s a mess. I lied (sorry!) when I said Mercury’s in retrograde, and that’s why nothing’s working out right now — Mercury retrograde ended a week ago. This year, Mercury was in retrograde from January 30 to February 20, May 29 to June 22, and September 27 to October 17. Mercury in retrograde comes and goes. The planet moves backwards for a bit, and then it stops and starts zooming on forwards again. Like Mercury itself orbiting, the periods of retrograde, of self-doubt and blunders and “everything that can go wrong is going wrong,” always pass eventually.
Maybe it’s midterms season or Mercury in retrograde that makes everything feel bad right now. But it will pass. It always passes. Mercury will reroute, and everything will be okay again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our tenure system is just fine, at least according to the committee of professors tasked with reviewing it. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Tenure-Track Review Committee released its much-awaited findings earlier this month, deeming their tenure system “structurally sound” despite recent controversies. The insights, part of a 105-page report, acknowledged the existence of “mistrust and low morale,” but still found the current paradigm for the most part satisfying.
The report's optimistic findings are unsurprising. The review process was severely limited from the get-go, unable to assess the secretive and controversial ad-hoc committee that proves crucial in tenure decisions, and unwilling to investigate the potential impact of race on tenure decisions and individual cases. Any assessment that stemmed from it was, therefore, going to prove limited in both depth and breadth.
Also unsurprising was the acknowledgement of ‘low morale’ and a lack of trust in the tenure process among faculty as recent, unexplained debacles have warranted this attitude. The current review was kicked off by the controversial denial of tenure to the beloved former Romances Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña and the subsequent backlash; its closing report comes merely months after Divinity School professor Cornel R. West ’74 was denied tenure consideration by the University.
West and Garcia Peña are hardly the first non-white humanities professors to be denied tenure, or to have their rejection evoke shock and outrage among colleagues and students alike. Both cases exemplify exactly the kind of unexpected tenure outcomes that have helped erode our community’s faith in the entire process, as acknowledged in the report. The University’s entire academic mission, including its pursuit of intellectual excellence, is substantially hurt by this decay of trust in the FAS’s ability to select those who will lead its knowledge production.
To repair this trust, we need more transparency. The main critique surrounding the tenure review process is its use of an entirely confidential ad hoc committee, which anonymously reviews tenure candidates and requests faculty pen private letters about the candidates to the dean. While we understand the need for confidentiality when it comes to the committee’s proceedings, the ad hoc committee must be reformed to provide detailed feedback to department chairs on its tenure decision, elucidating what strengths and weaknesses of each candidate led to the given result. This can help departments advise associate professors on their careers while protecting the crucial anonymity of those on tenure panels so they can continue to make rigorous reviews.
We know clearer feedback from the ad hoc committee won't fix bias, racial or otherwise. But perhaps the knowledge that some record will come from black-box committee decisions will encourage its members to more thoughtfully consider their approach and its concerning skew. Alternatively, it would offer students and faculty the opportunity to explicitly identify potentially concerning elements of the decisions, paving the way for more meaningful reform.
At its core, the tenure review process is a self-reinforcing system. The committee making the decisions is definitionally made up of those who have benefitted from the structure in place. We must make sure that this process of deciding what type of scholars and what sort of scholarship we deify at this University does not subscribe to the similarly self-reinforcing system of white supremacy. Thus, it’s imperative that those on the committee be aware of their position and conscious of their biases, a feat that would prove easier if FAS clearly defined the metrics and standards they use to evaluate candidates, as the Committee has suggested.
Whether this change and others suggested in the review will be implemented or not lies squarely in the hands of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and FAS Dean Claudine Gay.
Trust and transparency are deficient in the FAS’s tenure system. While this report declares that the aspects of the process within its purview to investigate are structurally sound, as long as the final ad hoc committee with the true decision-making power remains completely opaque, it will be impossible to restore faith in the system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, an incumbent member of the Cambridge City Council, hopes to highlight affordable housing, public transportation, and climate policy as he seeks a second term in office this November.
Sobrinho-Wheeler, who was elected to the council in 2019, previously worked at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge-based think tank. He has volunteered for the Boston Democratic Socialists of America as well as for the Boston Sunrise Movement.
In his first term, Sobrinho-Wheeler has frequently engaged with politics at Harvard, including signing onto a legal complaint about University’s investments in fossil fuels and supporting both strikes by the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
“One of the first things I did after I was elected in 2019 was stand with the Harvard graduate students at HGSU-UAW union when they were on strike out in the Yard in the snow,” he said. “I spoke to the folks there in support of the efforts for real recourse, gearing up on the contract negotiations to strike again this year.”
In addition, Sobrinho-Wheeler said he has worked with the Harvard Young Democratic Socialists of America and spoken with graduate students about their policy concerns, such as the cost of living and the quality of public transportation in Cambridge.
Housing policy — including supporting residents facing eviction, advocating against poor living conditions, and tackling the steep rent increases — has long been a passion of Sobrinho-Wheeler’s.
In 2020, Sobrinho-Wheeler co-sponsored the Affordable Housing Overlay, an ordinance that aims to create more opportunities for affordable housing in Cambridge.
While on the council, Sobrinho-Wheeler has served as the chair of the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee and co-chair of the Housing Committee.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said his work on amendments to Cambridge’s Cycling Safety Ordinance — which designates over 25 miles of protected bike lanes over the next five to seven years — has been among his proudest moments in office.
For Sobrinho-Wheeler, the issue of transportation safety is personal, due to injuries he sustained in a biking accident in 2018. He lost part of his two front teeth in a crash, and was forced to spend thousands of dollars on medical care, he said.
As he seeks reelection, Sobrinho-Wheeler said he would renew his focus on climate policy, and asserted that he brings an important perspective to the city council.
“I’m 29 — which is right around the median age of the city — and someone who's going to live with the experience of climate change as it continues to get worse,” Sobrino-Wheeler said.

Experts on artificial intelligence discussed the future of AI, its ethical implications, and its practical applications at a virtual symposium hosted by Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Friday.
The symposium, titled “Decoding AI: The Science, Politics, Applications, and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence,” was divided into four speaker sessions.
In the first session, Fernanda Viégas, a professor of computer science at Harvard, unpacked what machine learning means, explaining that machine learning eliminates the need for rule-based programming. Programmers instead program a goal, known as an “objective function.”
“The system creates its own sets of rules to understand that space,” Viégas said. “This is really great because what it does is that it unlocks the possibility of us trying to solve problems for which we don’t know the rules.”
Viégas said machine learning can be useful in fields such as medicine, where AI can diagnose diseases based on large amounts of data.
However, Viégas said the use of AI can pose challenges with regards to how data is used. She cited the example of an AI used to diagnose patients with retinal disease which unexpectedly used the same health information to predict patients’ cardiovascular risk factors.
This dynamic puzzled physicians who did not understand how the system had determined that information. The example is indicative of the need for greater “transparency and explainability” in machine learning, Viégas said.
“One of the reasons why everybody tends to talk about AI interpretability and explainability is because you want to make sure that these machines are not doing anything incorrectly or not causing harm,” Viégas said.
Viégas also recommended that developers work with a diverse range of users and stakeholders when designing their products.
“If this is something that is going to impact communities, you have to take their perspective into account,” she said. “This is incredibly important to be including their perspective in the development — not only afterwards, but in the development of your technology.”
In the third session, Rana el Kaliouby, an executive fellow at the Harvard Business School, discussed the connection between AI and people. She said a primary goal of future AI development is bringing emotional intelligence to our machines and technology.
“It’s important that these technologies, and these AI systems have IQ, but it’s also important that we take a very human-centric approach to build empathy and emotional intelligence into these machines,” El Kaliouby explained.
Developers can attempt to “humanize” their technology by incorporating non-verbal forms of communication, such as facial expressions, posture, and vocal intonation, that they use to communicate their emotions, according to El Kaliouby.
“If you combine all of these nonverbal signals, that gives you a really good picture of the emotional and cognitive state of a person, and you’re then able to leverage this information to make all sorts of decisions,” El Kaliouby added. “Humans do that all the time to build empathy, and to build trust, which is needed in our human machine interfaces.”
The automotive industry seeks to leverage this technology in smart cars that evaluate whether an individual is driving while distracted, El Kaliouby said.
El Kaliouby said the advanced technologies of current AI enable developers to attain a more complete understanding of a driver’s mental state.
“We can understand combined face detection with body key point detection,” she said. “We tie all of that with an understanding of the emotional state of the individuals in the vehicle.”
Ultimately, Viégas said, future developers need to invest in ensuring that the technology being designed is controlled by the user, rather than the other way around.
“We can learn from these systems and we should be controlling them,” Viégas said. “They shouldn’t control us, we should be controlling them.”

Harvard Kennedy School introduced new Covid-19 safety measures, including restrictions on in-person dining and gatherings, following an uptick in student cases last week.
The school reported 15 new cases among students over the past week, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email to affiliates Friday.
While the new cases represent a small percentage of students at the Kennedy School, Elmendorf noted that the figure was “more than in all previous weeks of the semester combined and notably high relative to other Harvard schools this week.”
Of the 29 total Covid-19 cases reported among graduate students over the past week, HKS students accounted for more than half of recorded cases.
In response, Elmendorf outlined new Covid-19 protocols aimed at limiting the possibility of transmission from eating or gathering indoors. Students may only eat in approved areas while sitting alone and keeping their masks on except while actively eating.
“We do not know of any transmission so far in our dining areas, but with more people now having the infection, we want to reduce the risk of transmission,” Elmendorf wrote. “If conditions worsen, we may stop indoor dining altogether and look at other ways to contain risk.”
He also instructed affiliates to “not participate in indoor group activities with other students unmasked at any time” and to refrain from coming to campus if they feel unwell.
Elmendorf noted that contact tracing found no signs of transmission in the classroom, but rather “in two large, off-campus parties where masks were not worn.”
“If infections continue to rise, we may lose our chance to learn and work together in person,” Elmendorf wrote.
On Monday, Elmendorf announced that the testing cadence will also increase from once to twice per week for vaccinated students and from two times to three times per week for unvaccinated students.
The Kennedy School is not the only graduate school that has weathered a rise in Covid cases. Last month, Harvard Business School shifted some classes online for a week due to a spike in cases among MBA students.
Deepanshu Aggarwal, a student at HKS, called the new measures “needed” and “responsible.”
“I know multiple student organizations and groups who have cancelled their plans for the upcoming days,” Aggarwal said. “Students are receiving it in a very responsible way.”
Elmendorf called on students to protect themselves and those around them.
“As a community committed to serving the public good, protecting the health of our friends and families (as well as our own health) should be at the front of our minds,” Elmendorf wrote.

“I am not the sexiest candidate,” Councilor Marc C. McGovern said in describing his campaign for a fifth term.
“But I am probably the most effective candidate,” he added. “I get stuff done.”
McGovern — who has served four terms on the City Council, including one as mayor — is one of eight incumbents seeking reelection to the nine-seat council.
He began his political career when he was elected to the Cambridge School Committee in 2003. After four terms there, McGovern said he realized he wanted to be more involved in city politics and decided to run for the council.
“We could have the greatest teachers, the greatest curriculum, the best buildings,” he said. “But if kids are going home to no food and no lights and insecure housing, and aren't getting the preschool that they need, those are all city issues — not school committee.”
McGovern argued that his background as a social worker makes him uniquely prepared to tackle issues like housing insecurity and poverty.
“Most of the work that I do is not sitting in City Hall,” he said. “I'm in Central Square with folks from the unhoused community, talking with them about what they need.”
McGovern also said he has made addressing the homelessness and poverty experienced by Cambridge residents one of his campaign’s top priorities.
McGovern pointed to the Affordable Housing Overlay ordinance, which was adopted by the council in 2020, as proof he has been an effective advocate for these issues.
He said hundreds of affordable housing units are “in the pipeline” in the year since the ordinance was passed.
“Those are real, tangible results, real homes,” he said. “People are gonna have a roof over their head that they can afford, because of an initiative that I led.”
McGovern also spoke about the role Harvard should play in Cambridge.
“Cambridge’s relationship with Harvard is like a complicated marriage,” he said. “Cambridge wouldn't be Cambridge without Harvard and Harvard wouldn't be Harvard without Cambridge.”
“We need each other, yet we don't always get along,” he added.
McGovern said he wants Harvard to better house its graduate students, pay more in property taxes, and facilitate more collaboration between the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Cambridge Public Schools.
He recognized, however, that the University’s role in Cambridge is sometimes underappreciated.
“I think Harvard does do a fair amount for the city, a lot of it they don't get a lot of credit for,” McGovern said. “The problem is they could always do more, they have so much wealth.”
McGovern said though residents can feel like they are living in a very progressive city, there are still “serious inequities.”
“We are a classist and racist country,” he said. “And Cambridge is part of that.”
McGovern added that he hopes Cantabrigians elect city councilors who match their words with actions.
“We're a great city,” he said. “I love it here, I love raising my kids here. But we are far from perfect.”
“We’ve got to really elect councilors who are going to back up what they say they believe in, and not people who find excuses,” McGovern added.

Harvard affiliates, tourists, and volunteers convened at the Charles River this past weekend to attend the Head of the Charles Regatta, one of the world’s largest rowing events.
Upwards of 11,000 athletes participate in the regatta each year. Rowers and spectators alike returned to Cambridge on Friday for the first time in two years, as last year’s event was cancelled due to Covid-19 safety concerns.
Harvard crew team members shared their excitement about competing at the Head of the Charles.
Lars F. W. Caspersen ’24 — a member of the Harvard men’s lightweight team that competed in the Club 4+ race — said the regatta had “a pretty electric atmosphere.”
“No one had really competed in two years,” Caspersen said. “So people were really, really excited to get out there.”
Haley J. Kwoun ’24 — coxswain for the men’s heavyweight team that competed in the Club 4+ race — said competing at the regatta was a “very high stress situation” but that the race also brought “ton of excitement.”
“The support from the crowd feels amazing,” she said. “And knowing that a lot of the Houses and communities were out there cheering for us was insanely cool.”
Alexander M. Sullivan ’24 — a member of the men’s heavyweight team that competed in the Championship B race — said he was pleased with the performance of the Harvard crew program.
“We put a good mark out showing that we’re still a competitive program, and we have quite a lot of depth in the squad,” he said. “It’s a really good place for the team to move on from here through the rest of the fall.”
For brothers Eric W. Huefner ’88 and Steve F. Huefner ’86, this year’s Head of the Charles Regatta was a familiar scene. Steve rowed for the heavyweight crew team during his time at Harvard, and the brothers have enjoyed numerous regattas since graduating.
Steve Huefner described Saturday as a “perfect day” for the regatta.
“All the people who come just to take in the moment, a lot of them are not always watching the regatta,” he said. “They may have a particular event that they know comes up so they want to cheer someone on for a bit, but then the rest of the time they’re just enjoying being outdoors along the river.”
The Head of the Charles Regatta attracts hundreds of thousands of people every year from around the world. Erik T. Kahler flew in from Chicago to watch his daughter compete and applauded Boston for being a convenient travel destination for this special event.
“Boston is an easy place to get to, when the weather’s good,” Kahler said. “It’s definitely used to having visitors so it’s very manageable to get around.”
Matthew M. Pluzsik, a student at Ramapo College of New Jersey who chose to attend the event after seeing regatta volunteers in Cambridge, said he enjoyed watching the rowers compete.
“It’s good to see when there are a few rowers that are right next to each other, and how they try to pass each other,” he said. “Everyone’s so in sync, and they’re working toward that common goal of getting to the end.”
Rachel F. Bregman drove in from New York to cheer on her daughter — Daniella Bregman ’25 — in the Harvard lightweight women’s crew race and said the regatta was pretty similar to previous years despite the ongoing pandemic.
“From a spectator perspective — to us — it seems just as busy as ever,” Bregman said.
Local vendors also lined the Charles River throughout the weekend to sell their products.
Students at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School held a bake sale at the regatta to support the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y Harvard Square.
Dennis Peters – director of marketing at Gourmet Nut – gave out samples of the company’s Power Up Trail Mix at the regatta.
“This is a great crowd for us because we want to get in with folks who are in college and love to get healthy,” he said.
Peters added that he had been attending the regatta for the past 25 years.
“It’s great to see everyone back after last year not happening. I think the weather helped a little bit, but generally speaking, people seem really excited to be here,” he said. “Everybody seems really happy, actually, which is good to see.”

With the graduate student union poised to stage a walkout in the coming days, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said Friday that the College is making plans to maintain academic continuity if teaching fellows and course assistants leave the classroom for the picket line.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers threatened to initiate a three-day strike on Oct. 27 if an agreement with the University is not reached. Contract negotiations between Harvard and the union, which began in March, have been hampered by ongoing contention surrounding compensation, benefits, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints.
Khurana said in an interview Friday that in advance of the potential strike, the College is working to avoid disruption to classes.
“What the College is trying to do is to minimize any kind of negative impact on our educational mission if there is a strike,” he said. “We are undertaking contingency planning, working with our faculty and our staff to support our students.”
“This is a prudent thing to do — about ensuring academic continuity for our students, while also respecting the rights of our graduate students to vote to organize a strike,” Khurana added.
In advance of Wednesday’s deadline, many union members — who work as teaching fellows, course assistants, and graduate research assistants — made announcements to their students during class or over email about the strike, their plans to participate in the strike, and ways for undergraduates to get involved.
In addition, some teaching fellows have rescheduled or canceled sections and office hours, and some professors have elected to move classes online.
HGSU-UAW also circulated a document outlining how the strike will affect undergraduates. Per the document, graduate student workers will refrain from grading assignments, responding to emails, and holding sections and office hours if the three-day strike takes place.
“We understand that our strike is going to interfere with your learning or your receipt of grades and feedback,” the document reads. “That being said, it will be up to individual faculty to decide whether or not they will grade or hold sections in the TF’s absence. If a graduate student is your main instructor for a course, then that striking graduate instructor will cancel class.”
Khurana said the College is working to support faculty with resources to avoid disruptions to class instruction during this time.
“Our goal is to make sure that we’re planning for academic continuity for our students and giving our faculty and staff the tools they need to adapt to circumstances as needed,” he said.
In September, the union voted overwhelmingly in favor of initiating a strike — with nearly 92 percent of members in support.
If the union does initiate a strike on Wednesday, it will be its second walkout in two years.
In December 2019, HGSU-UAW went on strike for 29 days following a year of bargaining with the University over issues like compensation and discrimination and sexual harassment grievance policies.
For the duration of the nearly four-week strike, striking union members stopped holding sections and office hours and grading assignments and exams.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview last week that the University plans to continue negotiating with the graduate student union and that he is hopeful the two sides can reach an agreement without a strike.
The two sides will convene for one more bargaining session before the deadline on Wednesday, with another scheduled for that day.
Regarding the state of negotiations, Khurana said that he recognizes there is “good will on every side to get to a resolution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale will not host Harvard College students during this year’s Harvard-Yale football game due to coronavirus-related restrictions, recommending students arrive and leave the day of the Game, the Harvard Dean of Students Office wrote in an email Friday.
Last year, the schools cancelled the highly-anticipated football game for the first time since 1943, when Harvard suspended its football program during World War II. In lieu of the 2020 game, the universities held a virtual spirit week. The Game will return to Yale this year on Nov. 20, though with several restrictions on housing and transportation.
Breaking with previous years, Yale will not host Harvard students in the college’s dorms in New Haven, according to the email from DSO. In previous years, Harvard upperclassmen houses and freshmen dorms paired with Yale’s residential colleges to allow students to stay in common rooms on a first-come, first-serve sign-up basis.
The DSO wrote that it “strongly encourage[s]” students to arrive and leave on Saturday. Usually, many undergraduates choose to stay overnight at the host school the night before to party — whether at Harvard’s final clubs or New Haven’s nightclub Toad’s Place.
Harvard will provide shuttle buses that leave Cambridge on Saturday morning and return that same evening. There will be a “significantly smaller” number of shuttle bus seats available than game tickets, the DSO wrote, due to a “bus driver shortage.”
Students who want to stay the night will need to make arrangements for their own transportation and housing, turning to pricey alternatives like Airbnbs or hotel rooms. As a result, some students said the restrictions will disproportionately impact low-income students.
Abigail A. Golden ’24 said she has heard some students are planning to rent Airbnbs. That option, though, is “not feasible for a lot of people.”
“I just think it really stinks, and also it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me,” Golden said, referring to the housing restrictions. “Our cases are pretty low, and I’m not sure how well that reflects [Yale’s] numbers, but they seem to be fine.”
Regardless of the restrictions, Will S. Hahn ’25 said he believes the Game has always privileged students who have networks at elite universities like Yale.
“You have so much more of a reason to go if you do know somebody who’s at Yale,” Hahn said. “If you don’t, it’s just a lot less fun.”
In an email, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane noted that shuttle tickets are accessible through the College’s Student Events Fund. The fund aims to remove financial barriers that would limit students’ participation in campus events.
Byron S. Gonzalez ’25 said he believes freshmen and sophomores are also at a “disadvantage” because they do not know what to expect.
“I’m still kind of clueless with what’s going to happen,” Gonzalez said. “Hopefully they send more information.”
Some students said they have made alternative housing and transportation arrangements.
Jaya J. Nayar ’24 said she will stay at a friend’s off-campus apartment. If she cannot secure a seat on Harvard’s shuttle, Nayar said she will look into taking the train or renting a Zipcar.
“There are other ways to get around it, hopefully, but I definitely want to go,” she said.
Liana L. Owen ’22 said she never intended to stay overnight in New Haven. The reduced shuttle capacity, however, complicates her plans.
“If I can’t get the shuttle, I’ll probably just consider doing something else that weekend.”
Despite the Covid-19 restrictions, some freshmen and sophomores said they are excited to experience the festivities for the first time.
“A bit of a bummer, but I think it’ll still be fun,” said Shilpa Gunuganti ’24, who said she remains undecided about her Harvard-Yale plans.

So. Halloween is approaching, everyone’s got their super cool outfits planned, and the online delivery dates for every costume order estimates at least a November arrival. What is a broke college student to do? Well, fear not! Check out these creative ideas for free, last-minute costume ideas that are sure to turn some heads at your less-than-10-person suite kickbacks this weekend.
House Flag Toga
See those colorful flags that hang on the outer walls of each House? Take it now as a challenge for you and your besties to catch ‘em all and make the best group costume this campus has ever seen. Whether you decide to rep some classic House pride or show out for your River daddy’s residence, this one will make for some excellent dorm decor when the Halloweekend festivities are over.
Be a Tourist: Stare at Them, for a Change!
Turn the tables on the tourists and make up for every sneak photo they’ve taken of you walking across the Yard or invasive glance thrown into your freshman year dorm. All you’ll need is every piece of Harvard merch you own and a camera— take up residence on Widener steps, stare down those tour groups, ready your cameras, and let the fun begin.
Mummy? Sorry: Covid Test Pamphlet Wraps
Instead of tossing those Color pamphlets that come with every Covid test you’ve definitely stayed on schedule for, opt for the eco-friendly route and reuse those bad boys! Though the dark blue hue might be a bit unconventional for a mummy, it seems pretty on par with the rest of this year, doesn’t it? If you start saving them up now, you’ll honestly be able to make enough mummy costumes (in-theory) for every weekend until midterm season “ends”.
Skimpy Superhero: HUDS To-Go Containers
Just like those to-go containers have saved many of us when we’re running late or avoiding prime breakfast time for athletes in the Quincy d-hall, they could also help you make a great showing as a superhero come Halloweekend. Using the containers and lids to make sure everything is covered and secured, all you’ll need to add is a utensil as your weapon of choice. Not sure who you could go fight now that you’re all dressed up, though— maybe the rats?
Group Costume Bonus: That Free Crewneck from the Student Involvement Fair
We’re all basically matching every day in that crewneck, anyway.
When all’s said and done, no costume can measure up to the satisfaction of knowing that, at long last, we’ll be able to spend this spooky holiday in-person and on-campus with friends. Regardless of what you wear, remember to have fun, stay safe, and eat a lot of candy. Happy Halloween!
