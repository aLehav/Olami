After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When choreographer Mark Morris rehearses in his studio, he looks like he is conducting an orchestra. Walking across the wooden floor with a brown shawl wrapped around his shoulders and New Balance sneakers on his feet, Morris points first to the piano, then to the dancers. A musical scale falls, then one of the dancers falls too; but the two movements don’t echo, they come together.
“I don’t want people to look like they are dancing in response to something,” Morris explained to a crowd in Sanders Theater last Wednesday (this time wearing a pink shawl and the same sneakers). The relationship between music and dance was the focus of his discussion with former Boston Globe music critic Richard Dyer, a fitting preview to the Boston premiere of Morris’s “Mozart Dances” at the Boston Opera House last weekend.
At the heart of Morris’s choreography—which ranges from a reworking of “The Nutcracker” set in the 1960s to a film collaboration with Yo-Yo Ma—is the idea that while dance may be set to music, the dancer’s movements should not be a direct reflection of the movements of notes and scales. “The dancers shouldn’t look like they are running from a firing pistol.”
This approach, he explained, is formulaic and reductive. “[The same] music comes in a bunch of ways every night,” Morris said. “So do my dances.”
As a result, he never rehearses with recorded music, which, he said, restricts the movement of the dance. In a video recording of a studio rehearsal shown during the talk, he said, “There is always room for being alive; that is why I always work with live music and live dancers.”
In choreographing “Mozart Dances,” Morris had an added consideration. Mozart’s music is notoriously tricky to choreograph to, Dyer explained to the audience. He mentioned that famed ballet choreographer George Balanchine himself allegedly claimed difficulty when setting dances to Mozart’s music.
But Morris was not intimidated. “They say that Mozart’s music is too fragile, structurally too perfect,” he said. “As if, when you threw a branch, it would fall apart.” But while Mozart’s music is structurally sound, its supposed difficulty simply creates an intimidating aura around the composer’s work. “Mozart’s music is great,” he said. “Why not dance to it?”
Morris’s composition, which is set to two concertos and a sonata, often moves against major trends in the music. In “Eleven,” the first piece of the show, “The concerto is jagged and edgy,” he said. “The dance, on the other hand, moves in a very lyrical fashion.”
In doing so, he brings out nuances in the music. The second piece, “Double,” features a circle of men whose dance forms a large, tilting disk. “It’s one of the most beautiful things you have ever done,” Dyer told Morris during the talk.
Morris responded, “It’s one of the most beautiful things Mozart has ever done.”
The conversation between the two was lively. Early on, Morris announced that the Office for the Arts had taken away a carpet in Sanders Theater for fear he might ruin it. “They struck the rug because I had red wine,” he said, pointing to a bottle on the table. “They had a choice between me and the carpet.” When he spilled his glass half-way through the talk, Morris declared, “Look!” as if proving his own prophecy.
As he argued with Dyer about the proper way to combine sound and movement, Morris continually returned to his love for music. “Music is the reason I make dance,” he said. “If I had no music I would just sit still.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was young, my family would spend the summer in Long Beach Island (LBI), a half-mile-wide tourist haven in Ocean County, New Jersey. My memories of LBI are of miniature golf, of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream cones, and of long walks along the sand with my parents. Consider this along with—though my Irish name does its best to obfuscate it—my Sicilian heritage, and I’m perhaps as entitled as anyone to be offended by MTV’s “Jersey Shore.” But I’m not. I’m addicted.
“Jersey Shore” follows four male and four female cast members over the course of one summer in Seaside Heights, a popular vacation destination forty-five minutes from my fond vacations to LBI. The housemates, who range in age from 21 to 28, boast artificial tans, breasts, and hair; the men are alarmingly muscled and the women are alarmingly under-clothed. They proudly self-identify as “guidos” and “guidettes”—terms considered ethnic slurs by outraged Italian anti-defamation groups.
In fact, it’s hard to find an organization that hasn’t publicly condemned “Jersey Shore.” Among the dissenting ranks are parents, anti-domestic violence activists, and actual residents of the Jersey Shore. Even dermatologists have criticized the show, warning against the excessive tanning it promotes.
But here’s the thing: I genuinely like these people. I genuinely want Sammi and Ronnie to stay together. I genuinely hope JWoww gets rid of the questionable blonde streaks in her hair. The show’s creators have distilled something profound, because the cast’s lifestyle—vain, venereal, and violent—contains all our primal urges at a high concentration. Something halfway between a mirror and a nihilist manifesto, “Jersey Shore” presents us with the twenty-something human condition, reduced to its simplest form.
Vinny aptly summarizes the daily routine of the male housemates as “GTL”—an acronym for gym, tanning, and laundry. The “Jersey Shore” nightlife is its own exacting ritual of meaninglessness: drink, inexplicably get into a fight, and try to hook up with a stranger. Think Vladimir and Estragon at risk for serious liver damage.
The cast members do earn their keep by “working,” peddling T-shirts at a boardwalk store owned by their landlord. Beyond that, little mention is made of any professional goals or aspirations. Angelina’s explanation of her job is an unintentional punchline (“I’m a bartender,” she tells us, “I do, like, you know, great things.”), and the larger objective of Pauly’s DJ gigs is to entice female club-goers. They’re not on the short list for Career Day.
In a sense, “Jersey Shore” adheres to the formula first established by “The Real World” almost twenty years ago: eight housemates, ubiquitous cameras, copious alcohol. A drunk 22-year-old is a drunk 22-year-old is a drunk 22-year-old. Yet “The Real World” maintains the pretense of—the pun is inevitable—realism, casting such a predictably diverse group of people that they become their demographic archetypes. Each of the eight housemates fulfills a different quota, constituting a cross section of relatable youth culture. On the recent premiere of “The Real World: D.C.,” the first housemates to move in predicted the arrival of the “hot black guy” and the “gay guy” (the latter never came, but two of the cast proved to be bisexual).
By contrast, on “Jersey Shore,” the producers subtly pit themselves against their subjects. Their very objective is to showcase a lifestyle completely foreign to the viewer. Footage is mercilessly (and brilliantly) edited for punchlines, and great pains are taken to highlight the cast’s frequent malapropisms. The effect of this is to invite us to view the housemates not as reflections of ourselves, but as something entirely different.
For many of us—the college-educated, the pale, the deeply neurotic—each episode of “Jersey Shore” is an ideological vacation. Its appeal lies in the consummately indulgent philosophy it espouses. You can’t spell “guido” without “id.” For every hour the rest of us will spend working overtime at the office, they’ll spend another on the dance floor.
It’s certainly tempting to say their lives are wasted, meaningless—but so, to some extent, are everyone’s. We’re shown the end product of this lifestyle when several of the cast’s parents, who openly endorse their children’s behavior, come to visit the house. If they’re the “after” to the housemates’ “before,” they’re not doing so bad—they’re mostly the same, if more sun-damaged, and they seem as content as their kids.
If I’m honest with myself, I’m a little jealous. The housemates on “Jersey Shore” embrace the vapidity of their lifestyles wholeheartedly, as if there were no other option. I have more self-doubt in one finger than Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino has in his entire body, including—lest we forget—his infamous six-pack.
It’s not that we should abandon our responsibilities, crank up the house music, and flee to the boardwalks of South Jersey, but there’s a lesson here to be learned—life is short, but not too short for another shot of Jager.

Martin Eisenstadt, a former McCain campaign adviser, television talking head, and senior fellow at the neoconservative Harding Institute for Freedom and Democracy, is the bedrock upon which our illustrious nation rests—if he does say so himself. “Pundits have been essential to American democracy since the birth of our great country,” he says. “If George Washington was the first American president, then it could be said that Ben Franklin was the first American pundit. And guess whose face is on a higher denomination bill? I rest my case.”
“I Am Martin Eisenstadt: One Man’s Wildly Inappropriate Adventures With the Last Republicans,” Eisenstadt’s memoir of his political life and his work on the 2008 Republican presidential campaign, is filled with just such pearls of political wisdom. Over the course of a whirlwind narrative, the book offers telling glimpses into the ill-fated McCain/Palin presidential run, including the dysfunctional dynamic between the two halves of the ticket. Eisenstadt also drops juicy quotes from key players across the political and journalistic spectrum, giving us access to meetings, manipulations and machinations that took place behind the scenes of the Republican ticket.
Such insider information would be most valuable if not for the minor disadvantage of it being entirely fabricated. The book is in fact a work of fiction, as is the character of Martin Eisenstadt himself. But readers could be forgiven for being taken in. Indeed, for many months, no less than the Los Angeles Times, the Weekly Standard, CBS News, and even The Times of India were quoting authoritatively from Eisenstadt’s blog posts and press releases, believing him to be a staple of the Republican establishment. At one point, Time Magazine published his ‘tweets’ online alongside those of such luminaries as Newt Gingrich and Meghan McCain. In reality, however, Eisenstadt was the ingenious Internet concoction of two filmmakers, Eitan Gorlin and Dan Mirvish—a fictitious pundit working out of a non-existent think tank.
Backed by a series of authoritative-seeming dummy web sites, from a political blog to the Harding Institute itself (whose only real address was its virtual one), Eisenstadt pontificated on everything from the Jonas Brothers’ alleged terrorist sympathies to Sarah Palin’s geography woes. After finally being revealed post-election as a hoax and a scam artist, Eisenstadt returns, this time in book form, to tell his side of the story, writing in his foreword: “Trust me. I exist.”
As constructed by Gorlin and Mirvish (the book’s true authors), Eisenstadt is the pundit par excellence—a Washington operative with an inflated sense of self-importance, a political skill set inversely proportional to ego, and a grab bag of talking points in the form of arguments by assertion. His knowledge of international affairs is sketchy, but he is quite sure of America’s historical preeminence within them. His achievements are few, but his sense of self-importance is vast. He is obsessed with image and public perception—the kind of man who takes pride in signing his emails “Sent from my Verizon Wireless Blackberry,” not because he has one, but because it makes others think he does, giving him an excuse to write shorter correspondence. His is a certain personality type taken to its logical and hilarious extreme.
The book mixes satire of the Right (“I assured her that waterboarding is not considered ‘torture’, because by definition, the United States does not torture people”) with criticism of political culture in general. We are taught how to draft an official apology that does not, in fact, apologize. We are given a politician’s guidebook to having a tryst with a prostitute and not getting caught (“Pay with cash. Preferably, Canadian.”) and how to make a controversial blog statement that will get you on TV. The book takes a few chapters to find its groove—Gorlin and Mirvish clearly have much more to work with when it comes to the actual campaign than Eisenstadt’s pre-2008 political history—but once there, the narrative is consistently both entertaining and thought-provoking.
But in the end, who exactly is the butt of the Martin Eisenstadt joke? Though it is true that Eisenstadt’s pronouncements are often parodies of neoconservative slogans, the people truly made to look the fool by him were not conservatives at all. Readers might laugh knowingly whilst perusing the book’s numerous examples of important bloggers and newspapers that took Eisenstadt’s extremist rhetoric and ran with it, but in reality this is no laughing matter. The Eisenstadt hoax reveals numerous newspapers that failed to do basic fact-checking and a coterie of liberal bloggers such as those at “Mother Jones” and “Talking Points Memo” who saw utterly absurd reactionary rhetoric and believed it to be authentic, no questions asked—and then used Eisenstadt’s blog posts to pillory his party.
Ultimately, then, “I Am Martin Eisenstadt” is a cautionary tale. It warns against media outlets that prefer a sensationalist story to an accurate one, and about writers across the political blogosphere who are often too willing to believe the worst about their opponents without the slightest bit of charitable skepticism. It is a story that should be comic for its implausibility—and is unsettling because it is not.

These days, Bill Gates is as well known for setting new trends in humanitarianism as he is for advancing technology. On Jan. 29, Gates announced that his charitable foundation would, over the course of the next decade, donate $10 billion to vaccine development, research, and delivery—the largest amount of money ever donated to a single cause. Copious amounts of credit, thanks, and praise should be given to Bill and Melinda Gates for providing funds for a very worthy cause.
The need for vaccines in developing countries is still great, and the amount of lives to be saved with immunizations for epidemics like tuberculosis, malaria, and pneumonia numbers in the millions. While many agencies and international organizations like the World Health Organization are working for similar improvements in this area of global health, the pledge by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will result in vaccinations occurring more quickly, as there will be less bureaucracy to navigate and a very specific directive to follow.
Yet, while the benefits of this announcement are laudable, one part of Gates’s presentation of this effort has stirred some controversy—with good reason. During the initial announcement of this campaign, Gates outlined the risk of governments diverting aid normally marked for health toward climate change, emphasizing that health must still remain a top priority, even with all of the current data on global warming available. He justified a continued prioritization on health by arguing that better health worldwide will lead to reduced birth rates, thereby diminishing mankind’s contribution to climate change.
While it is true that many of the world’s problems are intricately linked, Gates unnecessarily antagonized much of the global community with his statement. His donation speaks to his own priorities, and he did not need to conflate his good deed with a comment on a separate, and contentious, issue. Bill and Melinda Gates’ decision to direct their foundation’s funds toward an initiative they believe to be extremely important will allow vaccinations to reach those who need them, even if countries and international organizations focus their attention elsewhere, Gates should have focused on that fact instead.
Though they may be only one step toward improving lives around the world, vaccinations are of the utmost importance. A simple inoculation can prevent common diseases that would otherwise cause death, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s pledge acknowledges the very real possibility of improving global health via vaccinations. In that sense—and ignoring his unnecessary commentary about global priorities—Gates’s pledge for the coming decade is a wonderful and laudable example of an entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist.

Problems in global health are rarely well served by philosophical binary or good intentions alone. Global health is a highly politicized field, one in which questions of implementation, priorities, and ethics make the question, “How can we eliminate problems in global health?” one that requires a far more complex answer than is immediately obvious.
The very complexity of this issue demands that we cast a critical eye on all well-intentioned efforts to remedy global health deficiencies worldwide, no matter who leads these efforts or the monetary backing accompanying them. Bill Gates’ recent pledge of $10 billion toward global immunization of children is no exception.
Gates’ pledge is atypical in the field of global health. Manifest in his massive donation is the will of an individual who is acting with almost full agency, thanks in part to his own considerable wealth. This has obvious benefits: A single person can often move much more quickly than some of the less agile organizations involved in global health, since they do not have to contend with the same political forces and special interests. Gates’ immense wealth grants him a type of influence in the field that resembles state power, but unlike the decisions of a government or large institutions, such as the World Health Organization, his actions remain unchecked by the authority of a democratic will. The unrestricted power that results can change the very landscape of global health, altering both priorities and methods of healthcare implementation, sometimes with negative results.
This is not the first time that Bill Gates has affected a health-related cause. For years now, Gates has exerted his influence over efforts to treat HIV/AIDS in traditionally underserved regions, including sub-saharan Africa. A Los Angeles Times investigation explored the effects of Gates’ involvement and found that, contrary to the assumption that more money solves more problems, the Gates Foundation’s implementation of efforts to treat HIV/AIDS produced mixed results. Some of these findings call into question whether Gates’ initiatives create even a net-positive impact. The negative effects include an epiphenomenal dearth of qualified clinicians in other parts of Africa like Lesotho or Rwanda, also known as “brain drain,” the weakening of local systems of health due to a shift in focus, and a diversion of attention and personnel from other health-related issues, such as basic care.
Proponents of such initiatives may find it satisfying to rest on the anodyne logic that any aid is good aid. Others note that while it is easy to argue for critical analysis of health care delivery methods, people are dying all around the world. Both of these arguments are a disservice to the seriousness and complexity of the issues. Organizational approaches to global health are not always ideal, but at the very least they benefit from heterogeneous influences and collective input from individuals who all share equal standing. Gates’ authority does not benefit from this kind of democratic input—he has advisers, but ultimately he and his wife are the ones in charge.
Gates’ generosity is surely laudable, and his intentions are beyond reproach. However, his methodology is less commendable. His status as the primary financial backer and head of the Gates Foundation creates a lack of accountability, and his actions can therefore have unintended results. The conclusion here is not that Gates should have refrained from funding a noble cause in global health, but rather that he should act through accountable organizational structures, like that of the World Health Organization. While such institutions are not immune to unintended consequences, their collective wisdom, abundant expertise, and historical awareness serve as better safeguards against unintended consequences than the will of one man could ever provide.

Pre-Harvard, many of us were big fish in a small pond. However, once on campus, we are quick to realize that we are really just guppies. The passing of time effaces our past successes, and we have to adjust to not always being ‘the best’. While any college experience causes students to reassess and ‘find’ themselves, I’ve discovered that this school can be a pressure cooker if students don’t know how to find success after failure.
How can you adjust and adapt? Similar to Kubler-Ross’s five stages of grief, the adaptive process one goes through when faced with overwhelming loss (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance),Harvard students may pass through five stages in order to be humbled – in a good way – by the Harvard experience.
Stage One: Denial­—This stage starts with the acceptance letter to Harvard and the thought of being one of the few who gets a coveted spot here. Upon arrival on campus, I was overwhelmed with the caliber of my fellow classmates. I had never been surrounded by so many kids my age that were already so accomplished. Did Harvard make a mistake by including me in this group of people?
Stage Two: Anger—Feelings of excitement insidiously slide into disappointment and intimidation. The esteemed faculty and incredible classmates can make you feel out of your element. Attempts to get involved, find leadership positions and continue with pre-college passions may result in disappointment when your ideas and efforts are not selected or rewarded. (Case study: Reporting for four years for the CBS affiliate in Houston, then being rejected by a student-run news show at Harvard). While getting used to the higher volume and sophistication of work, you may find test grades don’t quite make the grades you are accustomed to. (Case Study: Economics midterm, meet Meredith Baker. Meredith Baker, meet your Bureau of Study Council tutor.)
Stage Three: Bargaining—Intimidation may have taken root, and you find that you are constantly comparing yourself to others. Someone else is always smarter, better, more capable, more creative. You can’t brag to the person sitting next to you at dinner about vaccinating orphans in a war-torn country, because chances are that person discovered the vaccine. I had to accept the fact that I didn’t invent anything, found an NGO, or produce a documentary – but maybe I could fundraise for a charity or write for a newsletter. I tried to stop measuring my success and comparing myself to other students. It was a never-ending and exhausting feat.
Stage Four: Depression—While Harvard students in the humbling process may not feel ‘depressed,’ there are certain lows we hit when we do have to accept the fact that we can’t ‘do it all,’ and we are forced to compromise between saving the world or managing four classes and a handful of extracurriculars. Feeling like a nameless face in the collegiate crowd may lead to questions of self-worth and killed desires to get involved in things already so competitive and established.
Stage Five: Acceptance—When you are humbled by Harvard  you could say, “The more I see, the less I know.” And you now know that this means only that you are fortunate to have unique opportunities and access to incredible resources. While pursuing passions and planning for the future, you are humbled at every turn; by your classmates, the prestigious faculty, your first-semester crush, the local kids you tutor, or the person that tutors you. Humility also presents itself where you never expected—perhaps the homeless man pursuing his passion by playing music in the Square every evening, or the lunch lady who personally wishes everyone a great day as she swipes their card.
Winding my way through my first semester, I found strength through managing disappointments as well as successes. If you don’t make it to stage five, you are missing out on the incredible opportunities and experiences Harvard has to offer. While learning true humility—not just paying lip service to it—is not always easy, if we can maintain the proper perspective, we might just find real success outside the Harvard bubble.

Climate change is the single biggest challenge that Harvard students will face in their lifetime. Recognizing this, thousands of students flocked to last year’s “Green is the New Crimson” rally under the allure of apple cider and the chance to listen to a speech by Al Gore ‘69.
Before Gore’s speech, University President Drew G. Faust had boldly announced a new plan to reduce the university’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016. While the Office of Sustainability, the new Resource Efficiency Program, and the larger Harvard community enthusiastically declared their support to meet these sustainable goals, Harvard as a research university and educational institution has failed to establish a comprehensive initiative dedicated to tackling the climate crisis and developing renewable energy technology. If Harvard wants to emerge as a leading green research and policy hotspot, it must take bold steps to adapt to the clean energy revolution.
The lack of any such Harvard initiative is surprising, especially considering that, over the last few years, a general consensus among everyone from the line worker in Detroit to the silicon valley venture capitalist has been brewing in affirmation of the fact that renewable energy is the wave of the future. In his latest book, “Hot, Flat, and Crowded,” New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman asserts that “Green is not simply a new form of generating electric power; it is a new form of generating national power.” The race to clean technology will determine who the next billionaires are and where the next economic and scientific boom will take place.
Furthermore, many top rated academic institutions, including Stanford, Princeton, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have already made considerable commitments to green research and education. MIT’s Energy Initiative, for example, is financially backed by mega-corporations like BP, Siemens, and Lockheed Martin. The program boasts over 70 energy-related courses and interdisciplinary research groups of engineers, economists, management gurus, and policy experts. With BP and Ford’s blessing, the explicit mission of Princeton’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative is to “lead the way to a compelling and sustainable solution of the carbon and climate problem.” With Harvard conspicuously absent from the race, these other schools are going all in with clean technology, betting that they will attract millions of dollars in research funding and will produce the Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg of renewable energy.
It is not just Harvard that has failed to act. Many profit-seeking and socially conscientious students who feel sheepish about being “greedy I-bankers” have yet to consider careers as “green capitalists.” This is clearly evidenced by the size of the Environmental Science and Public Policy concentration, which has approximately 50 students every year.
Even if more students wanted to create the most efficient bio-fuel or found the hippest solar startup, it would not excuse the fact that Harvard has no specially designed educational programs to prepare them. While Harvard should be commended for establishing Environmental Science and Public Policy, the concentration is narrowly aimed at training the world’s future environmental policy makers and researchers, not the newest batch of renewable energy inventors, entrepreneurs, economists, and lawyers.
Nevertheless, Harvard does already have an impressive array of environmental courses under the Center for the Environment and is introducing courses this year like the Science of Energy, along with a handful of freshman seminars that focus on sustainability. But Harvard still lacks a cohesive undergraduate program for students to pursue these interests. In sharp contrast, students at Princeton can obtain a certificate in Sustainable Energy, and, down the river, MIT offers a minor in Energy.
Clearly Harvard needs to play catch up in order to fulfill its obligation as a premier research university and the historic focus of great policy debates. The university must develop a cohesive interdisciplinary curriculum and possible concentration or secondary field that will adequately prepare students to be the clean energy leaders and green gurus of tomorrow. Students of all disciplines must seriously consider careers in sustainability and should actively work with the university to establish these new resources. Proper forums and mechanisms should be developed to bring faculty across the university together to engage in interdisciplinary research projects at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Harvard should be open to adopting successful ideas and even collaborating with schools like MIT and Princeton. Ultimately, the problems of climate change and energy are so far-reaching and possibly disastrous that the brainpower and expertise of all the world’s top schools must play a part. The world cannot afford for Harvard to be absent from the fight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jan. 26, 2010 was an auspicious day for the people of northern Sri Lanka. They were eagerly waiting to vote in the first presidential election since the Sri Lankan Civil War between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan Government came to an end in May 2009. But what followed was a crisis that requires international attention.
The ruling party candidate, Mahinda Rajapakse, asked the people to show gratitude for bringing the 30-year war to an end, and to strengthen his mandate to continue his policies. A coalition of opposition parties offered former Army Commander General Sarath Fonseka as their common candidate and asked for a mandate to start a reconciliation process with the Tamils in the north. They also demanded the abolishment of the executive presidency, which is powerful enough to overrule decisions made by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, in order to empower the Parliament to be more responsible to the people by enacting new laws to fight state corruption, foster democracy, and promote freedom of expression. These demands stemmed from the fact that Sri Lanka has already had three armed uprisings after independence because of a rigid system of government.
Following unprecedented levels of abuse of state media by the ruling party candidate, the election commissioner demanded that all media follow ethical guidelines. Upon the state’s failure to enforce law, on Jan. 16, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka ordered the media to follow the guidelines of the election commissioner. This order fell on deaf ears. Violence escalated, and by Jan. 26, four people had died.
The violence did not stop there. On election day, people in the camps for internally displaced people in northern Sri Lanka waited in vain for the buses that were supposed to bring them to their polling stations. The bomb blasts that rocked some areas in the north reminded them of the horror of the war that ended just few months ago and scared many voters away. Fear brought voter turnout down to 20 percent in the north. But 70 percent out of those who ventured out to vote chose Fonseka’s cause. That sent the south a strong message that people in the north were thirsty for reconciliation, democracy, and freedom.
On Jan. 27, Sri Lankans realized that Rajapakse, the ruling party candidate, had won with a majority of 57 percent. Some bewildered voters questioned the results and started to spread rumors that the results had been rigged. However, according to state media, those rumors had been originated with malicious intent. Soon, the police arrested three people for sending out politically sensitive text messages.
A whole section of society was silenced while Rajapakse’s supporters celebrated. I tried to contact my friends who supported Fonseka, but they hung up the phone in fear. The election commissioner came out to officially announce the election results on the evening of Jan. 27. Soon after announcing the results, the government sent troops to encircle Fonseka’s hotel. Fonseka then requested that the Sri Lankan Elections Commission help protect his life and freedom of movement.
Some people might recommend that the international community impose sanctions on Sri Lanka in response to this crisis, but that would be unwise. The conventional policy of cornering governments that restrict democracy enables their leaders to further boost their patriotic image through state media by painting a portrait of a brave leader who stands strong against interfering Western imperialists. This further victimizes people in many ways: it provides leaders with a golden opportunity to censure the media, an opportunity to instill fear among people, a justification to arrest people on charges of conspiracy, and a reason to align with corrupt foreign governments that wait for an opportunity to exploit the situation. Mahinda Rajapakse’s government has already taken measures to block several web based news sources from people living in Sri Lanka. The government has already started to arrest newspaper editors.
In lieu of sanctions, the world must come up with innovative solutions that help oppressed Sri Lankans protect their democratic rights while imposing diplomatic pressure directly on leaders who restrict people’s rights. There are many people in Sri Lanka who are afraid to question the election results because they live in fear of persecution. Governments worldwide must take urgent measures to impose the highest level of diplomatic pressure on the government of Sri Lanka to stop arresting people for any conversation related to the election—this policy breeds extremism.
As a long-term measure, I urge foreign governments to give a higher priority to investments in credible information technology solutions to stop ballot rigging in the list of foreign aid to Sri Lanka. Finally, I implore all concerned countries to avoid imposing economic sanctions on Sri Lanka—they will only further victimize the victimized: individuals who love freedom more than most of their democratically elected leaders.

When my father was young he used to escape Brooklyn by going to Europe for the summer, taking his meager English teacher’s pay and using it all on a flight and two months of living abroad.  He likes to tell us that back then nobody could e-mail you money and credit cards didn’t exist.  I heard him recounting this once again to my college roommate who had come to stay the night at my house in Brooklyn the day before we would begin our own escape.
They were sitting at the kitchen counter, and I walked in on my dad going through the follow-up story, the one about sleeping in the pastures outside of Athens because he and his friends couldn’t get a hotel.
“Glory days?” I said.
“Yeah,” he laughed,  “Glory days.”
My mother too had been excited that night, spreading maps over the dining room table, commenting on our route. When she was in her 20s she had driven to California with a friend.  They came across a rowdy biker rally in Sturgis, North Dakota, and my favorite part of the story is the motel itself that was like a biker paradise: bikers at the pool, tattooed and lounging, with girlfriends, wives and kids.  They were still there when she left to get on the road in the morning.  You see, traveling is my one inheritance.
I forget who exactly had thought the idea up, but I remember, after a brief and excited discussion, pinning a printout U.S. map to the wall, with a thin pencil line charting a bus route from East Coast to West.  Going cross-country by Grey-hound, I thought, would be something: distance I could feel.  More pressingly, my free moments were ticking away.  Summers were starting to disappear, and in the not so distant future I’d have to get a job that, unless I became a teacher like my parents, would involve a sprinkled dribble of vacation days.  Not enough time to circle the country, like my mother had, or to traverse a continent across the sea, the act my father had repeated for so many summers.
So I left, and when I did, my mother said to take lots of pictures and my father said to write down the good things, so I did that too.  The point was (they implied) to prevent the country from passing in a blur of bus station lines; the idea being that otherwise, I would soon forget.
But things stood out right away.  On the first bus from New York we saw two soldiers waiting in front of us, bound for Charlotte, in camouflage fatigues and jackets with their names and little American flags.  It was a night bus, and I remember being feverishly watchful: a woman speaking into her phone—“operator”—in the dark, giant silver factories outside Baltimore, the whitewashed obelisk memorial as we coasted into empty Washington.
In Nashville, Tennessee, I asked the Sudanese taxi driver while passing the football stadium how the Titans did that season.  He said: “You know, you ask me hard question—it is because I only moved here last year.”  Where was he before?  Seattle, he said, fishing.  Three month journeys, 25 thousand a trip.  “But I’m from Sudan. Do you know where that is?” he asked.
Further south, pulling into New Orleans: once the lights appeared in the windows, the guys behind us shouted, “I’m back, been two years.” (“Five,” says the old man behind them.)  Coming into the station, the one where they built cages and kept federal prisoners during Katrina, you can still see the wire outlines.  That night, on Bourbon Street, women asking, “Looking for a good time?”  The suited man outside one club: “Guys, I got one question.”
“What?” we asked.
“Titties!” he yelled.
On the rural roads the buses go through empty cow fields; one had a propeller plane in it, nothing else.  Two women got on and sat behind me on the way to Baton Rogue, one with a boyfriend in jail, and asked us for money.  “Got three dollars.  Got a dollar?  No? How ’bout a phone?”  The man behind me riding through Texas, explaining the oil rigs and the horse corrals and the lines in the marshy grass that humans made for catching crawfish.
The river was dried up in San Antonio.  We joked that maybe they turned it off on Tuesdays.  Somehow it was better in dryness: the Alamo dusty and the cathedrals whitewashed and spare, the lights hanging over the riverbed, the mariachis on the cobblestones.  Walking into the Catredal de San Fernando, a woman with many bags walked around me towards the altar, huffing and taking deep breaths.
At nighttime you pass cities briefly and only once in a while, because those rides are just getting from one place to another.  No one talks on the night buses.  As the buses got further south and west the drivers make their announcements in Spanish.  “Cinco minutos aquí.”  Sometimes we would pass a truck on a country road with the truck coming in our direction and the bus would vibrate a little with the shadow of impact.
The coda to my dad’s Athens story about sleeping in the pasture is that, as I remember it, he woke up with a wet face, a cow standing over him licking.  The first time I heard this story we were having breakfast in Paris, a family trip over the summer, him reliving these 30 years. Rewalking the old haunts with his family, him envisioning the people he’d known there, their trivialities and revels.
The day after my mother stayed with the bikers, she stopped at an overlook to take pictures.  The pull-off was nearly empty.  The only person there was a biker by himself all in dusty black, a wild beard, parked and marveling at the scenery.  This is something that she remembers with a laugh and has told us often.
In California on some hilltops you can see clear to New York.  I asked an old Mexican woman with a shopping cart where the water was.  She said Superior. I thought that meant better: better than home, yes, I said.  Really it was the name of the street to the sea.  Sitting on a beach in Summerland, California, I thought about seasons, remembering, oceans, glory.

What is the Pope’s name.
The preceding are three items I feel comfortable sharing from my Google Web History, the Google App that, like it or not, signed up for it or not, records the entirety of your cyber history in a searchable database. I’m talking what you searched, what you clicked on, and how good it made you feel. Records are kept down to the exact minute.
What’s that, Mr. Sneaky? You’re safe? You deleted your search history? Cute. Sneaky thinks he can escape the life that Google Inc. has prepared for him. Just search “how to escape from Google” on Google.
Despite the effort of Sneaky and his troop of naiveté scouts, a short hike to www.google.com/history reveals that they did not—and can not—delete their search histories. Even using the erasure methods of a sexually self-discovering 14-year-old boy (delete cache, clear history, and clear forms—always clear forms), the best anyone can do is destroy a carbon copy of their search details. But that’d be like trying to snuff George Washington by sitting on a quarter—plain stupid. No matter which god you pray to, Jesus, Buddha, or Google itself (visit www.thechurchofgoogle.org for more info), all of that search history is forever recorded on Google’s servers.
In reality, this practice has been the industry standard for years, so why the fuss now? Two reasons: first, prior to April 19, 2007, such information was not available to the consumer. Second, before Friday, January 29, 2010, I did not know such a feature existed. Google had never informed me.
So as I scrolled through my sordid searching past on Friday afternoon, I felt like I was reading an unintentional journal—a militantly accurate, mercilessly honest one that recalled the time in June 2008 when I googled “Jessica Alba” followed by 14 different verb combinations. Uncomfortable? Yes. Frightening? Yes. Flattering of Jessica Alba? Depends what you’re into.
But despite my general panic at the existence of Google Web History, I decided to look for its upsides. For instance, it turns out that Google has far surpassed me in its ability to record my life. None of the 14 journals I’ve ever started even came close. Not the one I glued to my dresser (to force me to write), not the one I kept on my computer (which I trashed after convincing myself it had been forwarded to my friends), and especially not my Xanga online journal.
By the way, bonus points if you can find my Xanga—it’s the self-important one about being an angsty teen; the one with a hearty endorsement of the Iraq War; the one that, if found, will prevent us from ever meeting eyes again.
But we were talking about privacy. Google’s practice of storing search history presents two problems. First, it locks us completely into our pasts. With all my interests and inquiries known and catalogued, how can I ever reinvent myself? Currently, my options are limited to joining some past-erasing spy agency or killing my friends and stealing their identities.
But I’m not crossing my fingers; the spy agencies aren’t hiring (what with this economy, amirite?), and my friends have proved impressively hard to kill (what with their robust abdomens).
The second problem, however, is even more troubling. Google’s practice of making search histories available to consumers—and by extension, hackers, the media, or anyone else who wants it badly enough—means that with every search we make, we must ask ourselves, would I be okay with the world knowing that I want to know?
As anyone who’s visited 4chan.com understands, anonymity is part of what makes the Internet a revolutionary tool, and quests for knowledge that are stymied by fears of public ridicule are barely distinguishable from those which are simply forbidden.
Am I saying we can put the informational cat back in the bag? No. Am I being paranoid? Sure, but sensibly so. After all, I’d be ruined if the world ever discovered my lifetime subscription to [removed by editor].

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has reduced its deficit to $80 million, signifying a drop that FAS Dean Michael D. Smith credited at yesterday’s Faculty meeting to alumni donations, improvements in the international financial market, and last year’s cost-cutting measures.
At an open forum last September, Smith said that FAS would seek to reduce its deficit to $90 million for the fiscal year ending in 2010—a planned decrease of $20 million that the administration has exceeded by $10 million, according to its most recent estimates.
“I am actually very pleased,” Smith said yesterday. “Several times I had to ask Leslie [A. Kirwan ’79, FAS Dean for Administration and Finance], ‘Really?’”
Despite the good news, Smith said that much remains to be done to close the remaining $80 million deficit—an obstacle he called “huge”—and that the strategy for making cuts will be “relatively unchanged” from last year.
Last July, a new legislation passed in Massachusetts permitted Harvard to tap into its most recently endowed funds, which had fallen in value to less than the amount bequeathed by the donor and are considered “underwater.” Though the law’s passage arrived too late to help in last year’s budgeting process, Smith said FAS may tap into those funds this year.
In addition, University President Drew G. Faust said at yesterday’s meeting that a new capital campaign was on the horizon for the University, which has not had one in over a decade—“an eternity” for a school of higher education, she said.
Capital campaigns tend to have an initial “quiet phase,” during which the University assesses its fundraising opportunities and the types of gifts it may expect, according to Faust.
“In this environment, we need to be particularly sensitive because our donors were hit, as were we,” Faust said.
Though FAS departments and administrative units were urged last year to budget for a 15 percent decrease in expenditure, they will not be asked this year to cut their budgets by a certain percentage, according to Smith. Instead, the units will work with the administration to make strategic cuts—in acknowledgement of the consideration that some places have less fat left to trim than others.
In a lengthy PowerPoint presentation, Smith credited the generation of a myriad of budgetary recommendations to the six FAS working groups created last May and the Idea Bank Web site, to which 275 individuals have submitted suggestions.
Among the ideas posted—none of which have yet been approved but will see further discussion—were renting out the Student Organization Center at Hilles during the summer, admitting more Master’s students, and leasing some of the University’s space in Allston.
Smith also announced that the Registrar’s office will undergo a thorough IT redesign in coming years to ensure the alignment of its technical capabilities with FAS’ academic offerings. The site does not currently have the capacity to cross-list courses, according to Smith.
NEW NAME FOR DEPARTMENT
The Faculty voted yesterday to change the name of the Department of Literature and Comparative Literature into the Department of Comparative Literature.
Department Chair David N. Damrosch said that the department—as well as the Faculty Council—unanimously approved the name change. The current name “seems to all of us on the faculty to represent a kind of transitional phase in the merging of these two programs,” Damrosch said in an interview.
The literature department was formed nearly four years ago through a merger of the undergraduate concentration in literature and the graduate program in comparative literature.
In October, faculty members discussed changing the name of the Extension School to the “Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies.” The faculty held off on voting, and did not discuss it at the following meeting in December. No official mention of the name change has been made since.
DIGITAL ACCESS TO SCHOLARSHIP
At the Faculty meeting, Director of the Office for Scholarly Communication Stuart M. Shieber encouraged the faculty to continue uploading their work to the repository site Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard, which provides open access to faculty research papers.
Since the repository’s unveiling early in the fall, users have downloaded over 70,000 articles from nearly one-third of the FAS faculty, according to Shieber.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 3, 2010
An earlier version of the Feb. 3 news article "Though FAS Slims Down Budget, Work Lies Ahead" stated that the Faculty voted to change the name of the Department of Comparative Literature into the Department of Literature and Comparative Literature. In fact, the original name of the department was Department of Literature and Comparative Literature, and it will now be called the Department of Comparative Literature.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, a computer scientist with years of teaching under his belt, assumed a professorial role at yesterday’s Faculty meeting and used a popular lecture tool—a PowerPoint presentation.
Smith flashed a lengthy series of slides replete with charts, graphs, and figures up on the screen to inform Faculty members on the state of FAS finances and the suggestions generated by the six working groups created last May.
“If he has a projector, watch out,” said Reverend Peter J. Gomes, a mainstay at Faculty meetings, in anticipation of Smith’s presentation at yesterday’s meeting.
With the help of his large-screen presentation, Smith discussed the improved financial state of FAS, which is now $80 million in the red. But Smith shied away from details and gravitated towards general statements regarding plans to implement the budgetary recommendations devised by the working groups and his continued dedication to academic planning and Harvard’s “core mission.”
“I’m not going to actually focus on the estimated budget savings,” Smith said. “We will continue to look at them. But we do believe that each of the things I’m going to talk about will bring some amount of savings.”
His slides quoted passages from many of the working groups recommendations and cited broad ideas expressed by the groups—including continuing to offer a superior education to graduates and undergraduates, and maintaining the freedom of the faculty to research as they wish.
Smith said he would split the viable working group recommendations into three groups. In one category, he placed those options that he deemed most feasible and for which he would launch “targeted implementation groups.” The second group was a conglomeration of ideas that “would be discussed further.” The final group of ideas would be tabled indefinitely and “reserve[d] for future consideration,” Smith said.
Following the meeting, Smith sought to clarify that he does not see forming committees as an answer unto itself.
“I have a very strong opinion that you should only have a committee that’s going to do something good for you,” Smith said in an interview yesterday after the meeting.
Though last year’s financial crisis was an aberration from FAS’ normal financial circumstances, Gomes said that Smith’s lecture was not revolutionary.
“I’ve heard Dean Smith’s speech from every dean since 1970,” Gomes said. “It’s sort of a ritual.”

Harvard Catalyst, an interdisciplinary health research organization, will launch a competition soliciting insights related to type 1 diabetes from all across the campus—an endeavor that organizers say will hopefully lead to diverse perspectives on the disease and its treatment.
The competition, which organizers emphasize is an “experiment,” does not seek solutions to diabetes research and treatment, but instead ideas from a broad spectrum of individuals—both in and out of the medical industry—that might aid research. Organizers said they hope that a set of fresh eyes will yield innovative approaches towards the disease.
“Growing evidence shows that innovation often happens at the intersections of disciplines, frequently initiated by individuals who may not have expertise in the exact problem at hand,” Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier and HMS Professor and Catalyst Director Lee M. Nadler wrote in an e-mailed statement to the Harvard community.
The contest will be accepting submissions until March 1 and will award prizes of up to $10,000, including at least two prizes of $2,500.
Competitions have a history of successfully solving some of humanity’s most vexing problems—and the winners are often the most unlikely of candidates, according to Karim R. Lakhani, an assistant professor at the Business School and one of the professors behind the initiative.
For example, when the British Navy needed a device in the 1700s to accurately tell longitude, Isaac Newton claimed that navigating by stars was the only possible solution. But, Lakhani said, a watchmaker from the backwaters of Yorkshire solved the problem with a simple invention: the chronometer.
The Catalyst initiative seeks to gather ideas from those on the “fringes” of diabetes research, and from individuals who may not specifically study the disease but have reflected upon the condition, according to Eva C. Guinan, an HMS associate professor involved in the project.
The competition hopes to achieve what Lakhani calls the “democratization of science”—a goal that he said has been largely stymied by increasing academic specialization.
“There are many people who have ideas but don’t have the avenues to present them,” Lakhani said. “We feel that there are many smart people who may have thought about this or can think about it, and we’re giving them permission to think about it and then submit them.”
In an e-mail to the Harvard community yesterday, University President Drew G. Faust hailed the new collaboration as a “creative tool for enabling connections among people in the Harvard community with common interests.”
The Catalyst competition aligns with Faust’s call to the Harvard community to take an interdisciplinary approach to tackling issues in the environmental and public health spheres.

The Undergraduate Council will launch its Harvard for Haiti Web site this evening to help coordinate Haitian relief efforts between the UC and House Committees, according to UC leaders.
The Web site will serve as a portal through which students can donate to various Haiti relief efforts on behalf of their House or freshman dormitory yards—a tactic that taps into the stronger connection students often feel for a House initiative versus a Harvard-wide project, according to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11.
Instead of allowing students to directly donate to Haiti, the site will provide links to outside relief groups that each House or freshman dorm group has endorsed, according to Hysen.
“It’s not a competition,” said UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11. “The point is not to see who can raise the most amount of money, but simply for students to donate on behalf of something they feel very close to.”
The idea for the Web site originated last week in a meeting that gathered together Bowman, Hysen, Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh, and over 20 HoCo representatives.
The group decided that a Web site collating various aid opportunities would be the most effective response to the crisis in Haiti, according to Hysen, a computer science concentrator who designed the interface of the Web site.
Dunster HoCo co-chair Alana J. Biden ’11 said she was pleased with the partnership that has formed between the UC and HoCos.
Dunster HoCo representatives will be tabling at Dunster dining hall tonight to publicize the Web site and to encourage House residents to donate, she said.
“It’s definitely a good idea,” said Mather HoCo co-chair David L. Billing ’11. “I think we can reach a different group of people than the UC can just reach alone.”
The original intention of the Website was to serve as the home page for the upcoming student-run Harvard for Haiti Benefit Concert. But the concert’s site will now be hosted directly by the Boston-based organization Partners in Health “for simplicity’s sake,” according to Hysen. The decision was made yesterday, he said.
The Feb. 12 benefit concert in Sanders Theatre, which will broadcast online, will feature performances by pianist Charlie Albright ’11, concert violinist Ryu Goto ’11, the Harvard Glee Club, and Kuumba Singers, according to concert coordinator Barthalomew A. Sillah ’12.

Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young proposed during yesterday’s school committee meeting the establishment of a middle school in the city’s K-8 school system to close the achievement gap among different socioeconomic and ethnic groups.
“Not every child is getting exactly what they need,” he said, describing the distinct gap between white and Asian students and other groups including low-income students and those with special needs as “immoral.”
Young advocated accelerating the improvement of under-performing groups while continuing to support white and Asian students, as well as expanding the student body to close the achievement gap. Currently, eight of the 11 K-8 public schools in Cambridge have fewer than 400 students.
“When school size is too small, it forces both students and teachers to reside in a small marketplace of ideas,” Young said, adding that the current system may hinder development if teachers protect students so much that they cannot “rise or fall.”
Young’s presentation came after a five-month process of collecting data and engaging members of the community.
For decades, the committee has expressed a concern about the quality of education 6th-8th grade students receive in the city’s K-8 schools. Critics say that the system, which lacks a traditional 6-8 “middle school” environment, does not meet the needs of students in early adolescence.
When Young was elected, he agreed to provide concrete recommendations regarding “the middle school issue” within the first a hundred days of his tenure.But in September he announced that he would need more time to adequately prepare.
Young’s long-awaited proposal consisted of five different options, including keeping the K-8 system and replacing some K-8 schools with K-5 elementary schools and a new middle school. The latter option, which Young said he favored, provides parents with a choice of enrolling in either system.
School committee members received Young’s proposal yesterday with some reservations.
Committee members Patricia M. Nolan ’80 and Marc C. McGovern both said that they would need to review more data to determine which option would best address the school system’s issues.
McGovern added that he is not convinced that the district is unable to close the achievement gap with a K-8 system.
Young’s proposal to create a middle school was met with noncommittal support from others present in the meeting.
Cambridge Teachers Association President Chris Colbath-Hess said she did not favor any option above the others, as the proposals are still in their preliminary stages, but reaffirmed her commitment to address the discrepancy among students.
David P. Maher, a City Council member who is running for Cambridge mayor, agreed, adding that he would withhold judgment until details are finalized.
Young is scheduled to give a more detailed presentation of his model on April 6, and the school committee will vote on the plan in May.

Harvard Law School officials are still in discussion regarding potential responses to the deportation of an Egyptian-American HLS student from Israel in December.
Hebah M. Ismail ’06 had planned to work with Law School clinical instructor Ahmad Amara in Israel for eight days for a research project on Bedouin land rights, but Ismail was detained in Tel Aviv’s airport for two days and then deported. Now Amara is considering suing for compensation, he said.
Amara, who was not able to complete his research due to Ismail’s absence, said that he hopes to work with the Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic to help ensure that Law School students will not have trouble entering foreign countries in the future.
Tyler R. Giannini, the clinical director of the Law School’s Human Rights Program, wrote in an e-mailed statement that the clinic is “considering the most appropriate response in light of the circumstances and the best interests of Hebah [Ismail] and our future students.”
Amara  hopes that HLS Dean Martha L. Minow will write a letter to the Israeli consulate to protest the “discrimination, humiliation, and mistreatment of [Ismail],” he said.
Though Ismail wears a hijab, she said she has traveled freely to Egypt and South Africa without any issues. She was raised in New Jersey and is an American citizen.
But upon entering Israel, Ismail was quickly taken aside for questioning. Israeli security officials interrogated her and searched her belongings for eight hours before clearing her for border control and immigration, according to Ismail.
After refusing to let an immigration officer read her e-mails, Ismail was told she would never be allowed to enter the country. Ismail was then taken to a detainment room in a separate part of the airport, where she was held the next day. When she asked to call her family and Amara, Ismail was repeatedly told to wait.
Amara was able to track down and visit Ismail the next day—but as her lawyer, not her professor. They discussed her options, including raising media awareness or contacting Israeli government officials for help.
Ismail said she returned to the United States as she was followed by Israeli security officials.
“I was nervous before she traveled,” Amara said. “I knew that they would give her a hard time and that she would be interrogated. But I did believe that she would be let into the country.”

The Harvard College Democrats plan to step up their commitment to community service this semester with the creation of DemsCorps—a program that will partner with existing student groups such as the Environmental Action Committee and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, club officers announced at their first meeting of the semester yesterday.
The new program will offer different opportunities every week for its members, unlike some other community service groups on campus that focus on semester-long projects, according to Harvard Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11.
“Harvard often has the bad image of talking the talk and not necessarily walking the walk,” Berkenfeld said. “We want to change that.”
Though the Harvard Dems have undertaken small projects in the past—including weatherizing a house in Cambridge—Dems Communications Chair Lange P. Luntao ’12 said that DemsCorp will institutionalize the organization’s commitment to interacting with the Cambridge community as well as to attracting more service-minded members to the club.
The new program follows Republican Senator-elect Scott P. Brown’s recent victory, which galvanized the Harvard Dems officers to organize other initiatives, including a new fellowship for club members to work on political campaigns this summer.
“A lot of our members have seen their passion for Democratic candidates be stoked with the loss of the Democratic Senate seat,” Luntao said. “We are looking to really regain the kind of energy that there was on campus during the 2008 election.”
Berkenfeld added that he also wanted to strengthen the Dems’ alumni network to tap into potential funding sources and political opportunities for students.
Gregory J. Nickels, former Seattle mayor and current fellow at the Institute of Politics, also encouraged students to become involved in local politics and the community at the meeting.
“You have much more of a stake in the decisions that are made today,” Nickels said. “I would urge you to look at the local level.”
Several club members expressed their excitement about the new emphasis on community service after the meeting.
“It’s something you don’t see with a lot of political organizations,” Melanie A. Fontes ’13 said. “It’s a good new face, and it gives us an edge.”

Last year at the annual women’s Beanpot, it was Boston College goalie Molly Schaus who stole the show, stopping 40 shots en route to a 1-0 victory over Harvard for the championship.
This year, the roles were reversed as the Crimson’s own Liza Ryabkina took control of last night’s 32nd Beanpot opener. Scoring four goals, Ryabkina helped lift Harvard (13-5-4, 9-5-2 ECAC) over the defending champion Eagles (5-14-9, 4-8-4 WHEA) in a 5-0 shutout.
Scoreless in the first period, the Crimson got its first tally with 13 seconds left in a BC penalty. Less than two minutes before the second break, and with Harvard out-shooting the Eagles 33-12, Ryabkina converted a pass from senior Anna McDonald for the goal.
Even with Crimson junior Kate Buesser and freshman Jillian Dempsey taking the first four shots of the night, it wasn’t until Ryabkina put Harvard on the board that the Crimson began to take over the ice.
“One of the things I said to the kids after the first period was, ‘We’ve taken a lot of shots, now we need to get them through,’” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “BC did a good job of protecting their goaltender, then it was just a matter of learning from what they were doing and changing the point of attack.”
Only nine minutes into the third period, Ryabkina attacked again, picking off the rebound after Buesser hit Eagles freshman goalie Corinne Boyles in the wrist.
“Honestly I don’t know if we’ll run into a team as quick as them,” BC head coach Katie King said. “They come on you pretty quick so they make you make decisions quicker. That was something that took us a little time to get used to.”
Up 2-0, it took only two minutes until Crimson freshman Josephine Pucci got in on the action. With senior Randi Griffin winning a face-off on the Eagles side, Buesser shot a pass to Pucci who slapped it over Boyle’s right shoulder.
“Sometimes pucks don’t go where you want them to go and they bounce their own way, but on the bench we just kept talking about how we had to keep going harder and keep pressuring, keep doing all of those little things that we do well,” Ryabkina said. “Goals just came.”
The junior from Ukraine turned her words into action once again, rebounding her own shot and boosting Harvard’s lead to 4-0 a minute after Pucci’s point.
“One of the things Liza did so well tonight was protect the puck all over the ice, and that allowed her to do some of the things she wanted to do,” Stone said.
Using this control, Ryabkina struck for the last time with six minutes remaining on the clock to give Harvard its final 5-0 victory.
Ryabkina’s four goals marked the first time a Crimson player has scored four tallies in a game since Feb. 13 last year when Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 notched four in a win at Cornell.
Ryabkina’s final goal was one of 51 total shots Harvard took against Boyles and BC.
Despite blocking 46, Boyles was no comparison to Schaus, who last year refused all 40 of the Crimson’s attempts.
“She’s never played in a Beanpot before,” King said. “She’s never experienced any of this, and I thought she really did come up with some big saves for us, especially in that first period, to get our kids into the game.”
Boyle wasn’t the only goalie making her debut in the Beanpot. Harvard’s Laura Bellamy, who took over for injured senior Christina Kessler earlier this season, stopped 15 Eagles shots, including a 5-on-3 BC power play.
“It’s tough when you play behind a kid like Kessler but she’s adjusted well,” Stone said. “She’s making the saves she needs to make, allowing us to do what we do well.”
With a win over BC, the Crimson faces off against rival Northeastern next Tuesday in the championship.
“This is a pressure packed tournament,” Stone said. “Everyone wants the Beanpot. We value the Beanpot at Harvard University, and to be able to play for a championship in early February is a great experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When she arrived in Cambridge two and a half years ago, junior Liza Ryabkina was taken under the wing of Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, one of the most talented forwards to wear a Harvard uniform.
So it was fitting that last night, Ryabkina followed in her mentor’s footsteps, becoming the first Crimson player to score four goals in a game since Vaillancourt did it last February at Cornell.
“It felt pretty incredible,” Ryabkina said. “I was just sort of taking the opportunities [that] presented themselves. I know that I can do those things in practice, so I just did them in the game.”
The winger opened scoring with less than two minutes left in the second period, slamming home a pass from senior Anna McDonald on the power play to hand Harvard the momentum heading into the break.
And from there, everything clicked for Ryabkina.
“My favorite play of the game was not any of her goals, but the pass she made to [freshman Kelsey Romatoski] on the power play right out in front,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “A lot of kids don’t see that play by the defensemen. The little things like that, that’s when you’re feeling pretty good about yourself—you’re in the zone. It’s a matter of time before things start to fall your way.”
Ryabkina hit her stride in the third period, throwing shot after shot at Boston College rookie netminder Corinne Boyles.
With 8:40 gone in the third, the junior broke through, initiating a three-goal tear in the span of five and a half minutes.
No two goals looked exactly the same: coming off a good rebound from junior linemate Kate Buesser, low on the power play, and finally on an unassisted breakaway.
“She has another gear,” Stone said. “The more she plays in that gear, the better our team’s going to be.”
Since coming back from a knee injury in November, Ryabkina has put up 15 points in 13 games—and with 10 goals on the season, she is now tied with Buesser for the team lead.
It was a career high in goals for the junior, who is making good on the raw talent she has exhibited since her freshman season.
“I wanted five,” she joked after the game. “That was my goal for the day.”
POWERED UP
Ryabkina’s two power-play goals continued a pattern of recent success for a Harvard team that has struggled with a man up all season.
The Crimson had converted just 13 percent of its power-play chances coming into last night’s contest, but the team has scored four times with the man advantage in the last three games.
Stone has been shuffling her power-play units of late, but both units on the ice in the last three games have generated chances and goals.
“I guess the main thing is that we’re not trying to tweak it all the time, but we’re not afraid to change it if it’s not working,” Stone said.
Ryabkina’s unit—with McDonald and rookies Jillian Dempsey, Josephine Pucci, and Romatoski—was the group that found the back of the net last night, capitalizing on Ryabkina’s move from the point to the baseline.
“We’re really looking to put people in the right spots,” Stone said. “Depending on who we’re playing against…we’ve had Liza high on the power play, we had her low today, it was very effective for us.”
Harvard’s other unit—co-captains Cori Bassett and Kathryn Farni, senior Randi Griffin, and juniors Leanna Coskren and Buesser—tallied two power-play goals over the weekend, demonstrating the team’s newfound and balanced man-up success.
GETTING DEFENSIVE
While the Crimson’s offense had plenty of firepower last night—taking 101 shot attempts, 51 of which reached the net—its defense stifled a young Eagles offense that is still struggling to find its identity.
“With a young team…my kids are trying to make some perfect plays where we just have to make the hard-fought play,” BC coach Katie King said. “We had a three-on-one at one point, and we tried to tic-tac-toe it instead of just getting to the net and finding the rebound.”
Harvard allowed just 15 shots on goal, and freshman goaltender Laura Bellamy turned them all away for her second career shutout.
But Bellamy’s job was made easy by her blueliners, who limited the Eagles’ time and chances in the offensive zone.
“[The defense] cut off a lot of cross-ice passes that were going to the high slot or low slot—our kids were there tonight to do it,” Stone said. “They weren’t fixated on the puck, they were playing off the puck very well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the game of basketball, there’s nothing like a blocked shot that brings a crowd to its feet. That instantaneous moment of contact immediately categorizes the two players involved as either the “rejector” or the “rejected.”
When the Harvard women’s basketball team took on visiting Columbia last Friday night, junior forward Emma Markley made sure she was rejecting every shot that came her way.
And what a job she did.
The six-foot-three standout registered seven blocked shots—a season-high—in the Crimson’s 73-55 rout over the Lions. In addition, Markley scored 19 points and grabbed eight rebounds.
“I don’t really have a secret to blocking shots,” Markley said, before joking, “I have long arms. I have to put them to good use.”
In the game against Cornell the following day, Markley continued to manhandle her opponents in the paint, quietly chipping in 10 points to go along with seven rebounds. Despite playing a more complementary role against the Big Red—junior co-captain Christine Matera led all scorers with 16 points, while sophomore point guard Brogan Berry added 14 points and seven assists—Harvard’s 69-53 victory capped off a sensational weekend for Markley.
Not surprisingly, Markley was recognized on Monday as Co-Ivy League Player of the Week.
“I’m not even going to separate this weekend from the entire year,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I think she’s done a great job this year in staying disciplined and mentally tough. She has been consistent for us across the board.”
“She’s been doing a great job the entire season,” Matera said. “She’s the reason why we were able to beat Boston College and compete in our other nonconference games.”
As the only true forward on the active roster with any significant playing experience—co-captain junior forward Claire Wheeler is recovering from a concussion—Markley had quite the challenge in defending Lions forward Judie Lomax, a five-foot-eleven first team All-Ivy selection who led the country in rebounding last year with 14.3 per game.
“My goal was to keep her off the boards, turn around, and box her out,” Markley said.
By game’s end, Markley was clearly the more dominant player, relying on finesse and speed rather than sheer power to match up with Lomax and win the rebounding battle, eight to six.
In a matter of just three years, Markley has emerged from a reserve player recovering from injury to a veteran on this season’s underclassmen-heavy team. With the graduation of three forwards last year, Markley’s ability to provide an inside threat has proven to be even more critical for a team hoping to achieve balance in the perimeter and the paint.
Luckily for Harvard, Markley can do a little bit of everything.
“Markley’s the best forward in the league at running the floor, but she can also hit the little 10-foot jumper and post up near the basket,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s pretty unstoppable, in my opinion.”
“[Markley] is a great post player who draws so much attention,” Matera said. “With people going down to double her, it definitely opens up the outside game for the guards. She definitely makes my job easier.”
Perhaps most importantly, Markley has stepped up this season to provide leadership for a young team that has no seniors on its roster. In a league where experience rather than talent frequently carries a team to the top of the standings, Markley’s ability to lead the freshmen and sophomores will determine just how far the Crimson will go this season.
“Scoring wise, Emma’s always been an asset to the team,” Matera said. “But where she’s grown the most is becoming a leader.”
“I think all the upperclassmen have to step up a year early,” Markley said. “We’ve all been doing a good job leading the team. It’s not the simplest thing in the world to keep a team together for the entire season, but we’re all working together.”
Yet, in spite of basketball’s team nature, it is clear that Harvard’s success hinges largely on Markley’s performance on the court. Given the way Markley has been playing recently—she leads the team in scoring, rebounds and blocks—it’s really no surprise that Harvard finds itself right in the thick of the Ivy title race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you think the Harvard women’s squash team (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) had it tough last weekend in terms of opposition, just look at the pair of foes coming up on the schedule. The Crimson will host No. 3 Penn on Saturday and No. 7 Princeton the following day. The only comfort for Harvard (and luckily for squash fans on campus) is that all this will be taking place on home territory at the Barnaby Courts.
It seems like the Crimson is cruising to a national title after beating No. 2 Trinity, 7-2, and No. 6 Stanford, 8-1, in back-to-back days. It was a physically exhausting stretch and a challenge for the women’s team. This past weekend marked the first time that Harvard dropped any matchup, going 9-0 in the first four games of the season. This weekend, the Crimson hopes to maintain its perfect record and escape unscathed.
Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa granted The Back Page an interview on Sunday after the Crimson handily beat its West Coast rivals. He shared his thoughts on the mentality of the team and its preparation in the days leading up to another taxing weekend.
Bajwa on the team dropping games to Trinity:
“Even the best of the best are going to have a bad day. But the best people win when they have a bad day. [Saturday] what we didn’t have was a bad day; what we had was different conditions. So when you play against Trinity, they’re the only one with panel courts. Their glass courts are different colors. The girls had a hard time adjusting to the conditions, so we lost a couple of matches. That’s all. In terms of if they were to play again, every one of them is capable of winning their match at a neutral place.”
Last weekend, sophomore Nirasha Guruge had an uncharacteristic loss, her first of the season, against Stanford’s Pamela Chua. Bajwa had this to say:
“I wasn’t surprised. I think Nirasha would win that match next time; it’s not a match that she can’t win.  But she played a five game match [Saturday], and she had to come up from behind because she couldn’t get used to the court. She had to work very hard to win that match, and [Sunday] she lost a little edge from having to play [Saturday]. I personally think sometimes you can have a bad win and a good loss.”
Forecast on the rest of the season:
“Injuries and well-being of the team is key to winning. Good planning for them so that they can perform on the day is the coach’s job. The work is done now, so it is a matter of being there. If belief is there and there are no injuries, then we should win.”
When asked about the Harvard-Princeton rivalry, Bajwa felt like it wasn’t going to play as big a role as it did last year when the Tigers’ championship team beat the Crimson in a heartbreaker, 5-4. Here’s what he clarified:
“I know that Princeton just recently beat Yale, but the stronger opponent coming into the match is Penn. Penn beat Princeton. [Last weekend] the toughest match on paper came [Saturday], and the next one will be on [next] Saturday. But it doesn’t get any easier playing Princeton the day after.”
Harvard’s preparation:
“We’re focusing on quality over quantity. Sometimes they feel like if you hang around the squash courts you’ll get better. The girls understand that they must do one and a half hours of quality training, and then save your energy and recover. Training and recovering at the same time is key.”

Who knew? In 90 minutes and for the cost of a couple beers ($6.95, so yes, we mean cheap college-kid beers), you can study the economics of beer using a board game sold by the Harvard Business Review.
The “Beer Game” models supply channel dynamics. It “simulates the flow of material and information in a simplified channel of beer production and distribution, focusing on the linkages among a beer manufacturer, its distributors, a wholesaler, and a retailer.”
So grab your three closest friends and see if you can manage the inventory of a firm in the market. According to the Web site, “Despite the simplicity of the simulation, most teams find it extremely difficult to keep inventory and stockout costs low.” Pshh, it’s just beer.
Anyway, the concept isn’t entirely new. A classic Beer Game was created by Jay Forrester, an MIT professor, in the 1960s (he also worked on an aircraft flight simulator in the 1940s—what a guy). Later a “Root Beer Game” was developed to demonstrate supply chain management. Homework has never been so fun.
Frankly, though, here at FlyBy we're going to stick with beer pong.

We're basically over the hump, meaning we're one step closer to the big day, Super Bowl Sunday. And thanks to the Upper Crust Pizzeria, it's going to be a little bit sweeter.
The Upper Crust is giving away free whoopie pies if you order a combination of three pies or calzones. These aren't just regular whoopie pies that we get during brain break in the dining halls, though. They're big—five pounds pig.
That's right, five pounds of whoopie pie. The creators of the dessert, Isamax Snacks, make a product called the Jumbo Wicked Whoopie. It's supposed to feed up to 12 people, perfect for a decent Super Bowl Party, and apparently Isamax Snacks' Wicked Whoopies have garnered praise from the Food Network, Good Morning America, and Rachel Ray.
All you have to do is order before Saturday to pick up on Sunday. So even if the Saints fumble in the last quarter or the Colts miss the game-winning field goal, we all can rejoice in chocolate cake and cream filling.
