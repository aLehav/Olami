After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After emerging victorious from each of its first seven matches, winning by a combined score of 59-4, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team will begin the second half of its season this weekend when it travels to take on No. 13 Pennsylvania and No. 1 Princeton.
The Crimson (7-0, 1-0 Ivy) has dominated its competition so far this season. Six of its wins have been 9-0 shutouts, with the remaining decision coming as a 5-4 victory over No. 5 Rochester in early December.
But some of the toughest nationwide competition can be found in the Ivy League, and the heart of conference play is about to commence.
“Even though we’re halfway through the season, this weekend, this is when the season really begins,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “The men have had one tough match to date…. It’s good to have a winning record and the confidence is high, but we’ve got to be tested to get deeper confidence.”
The Crimson will travel to Pennsylvania to take on the Quakers (3-2) on Saturday. Both of Penn’s two losses have been 5-4 decisions, one of which came to Williams, which Harvard defeated, 9-0, earlier this season.
The match against the Crimson will be the Quakers’ first in over a month.
Penn has achieved mixed results so far this season. Senior Danny Greenberg, who has played each match at the No. 1 position, has amassed a 3-2 record on the year. Each of the players in the next three spots is 2-3.
But the bottom half of the Quaker lineup has experienced much more success, as the No. 5 through No. 9 players have combined for an 18-7 record.
“No one takes UPenn lightly,” Way said. “UPenn’s going to be a battle. We might be favored to win on paper, but trust me, we’re going in there with the utmost respect.”
After the match with the Quakers, Harvard will make its way north to take on Princeton (4-0) in another conference showdown.
The top-ranked Tigers, who are also the defending national champions, have looked hard to beat so far this year. Although Princeton has only played four matches to date, it has won each decisively, with the closest being a 7-2 victory over Rochester.
Six players have played in the top five positions this season, and none of them have yet to experience defeat.
“I think [the Tigers will] be a tough match,” junior Tommy Mullaney said. “Princeton’s always a tough team to play, but we’ve been training hard, and I think we’re all pretty fired up. It’s definitely one of the biggest matches of our season so far.”
Senior Todd Harrity, who was the CSA individual champion in 2011 before Harvard junior Ali Farag won the title last year, leads the Tigers at the No. 1 position. Harrity is 4-0 on the season and has yet to drop a game.
When the two All-Americans met last season, Farag defeated Harrity, three games to two. But Princeton would have the last laugh, as the Tigers went on to deal the Crimson its first defeat of year in a hard fought, 5-4 contest.
“It’s going to be a good battle,” Way said. “I think the score line is likely to be 5-4, 6-3, one way or the other. So it’s going to be an exciting day.”
Harvard has seen solid production up and down its lineup all year. Every player to take the court so far has posted a winning record, and only four of those 22 competitors are not currently undefeated.
Spearheading the team at the No. 1 position is Farag, who has posted a 3-0 record on the year. Fellow junior Brandon McLaughlin plays at No. 2 and is 4-0 on the season. Both players have each dropped only a single game all season.
“[Farag and McLaughlin] are leaders because they’re playing one and two, but they’re also leaders because of the style that they play,” Way said. “They lead through playing a very intelligent game, which we always like…. It’s that leadership brought from the top—because everyone aspires to play like them—that has been absolutely terrific.”
The team is also led by junior Gary Power, who has posted a 3-1 record, predominantly at the No. 3 spot. Sophomore Tyler Olson, along with juniors Mullaney and Nigel Koh, have also produced consistent results in the middle of the lineup, combining for a 10-2 record.
Although the Crimson has experienced plenty of success so far, the season will ultimately be assessed based largely on how the team fares in the matches that will occur in the upcoming weeks.
“I think [our wins] give us a lot of confidence, but at the same time, we’ve got a really tough part of our season coming up,” Mullaney said. “We’re glad that we’ve been training really hard, and it’s nice to finally get things going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off dominating road performances last weekend, the No. 2 Harvard women’s hockey team (11-1-1, 9-0 ECAC) looks to continue its strong start to the new year when it hits the ice this weekend, taking on two more conference foes. The Crimson will face off against Ivy foe Princeton (6-10-2, 2-8-2 ECAC) at home ice on Friday night, but the most important battle of the weekend will come the following night at Bright Hockey Center.
In a battle between the top two teams in the ECAC Harvard will take on Quinnipiac (12-7-2, 7-3-1 ECAC), as the Bobcats look to overcome a one-point deficit and potentially take the top spot in the ECAC standings.
The Crimson topped both the Tigers and Quinnipiac in early season road match ups.
Back in October, Harvard travelled to Hamden, CT to take on the Bobcats in only its second game of the season. A power play goal by co-captain Jillian Dempsey put the Crimson up in the first period, and a second period goal by sophomore Hillary Crowe sealed the 2-0 shutout victory.
Quinnipiac, however, have picked up some steam since the start of its season. The Bobcats enter this weekend’s match-up riding a five-game win streak, fresh off a 4-1 victory over McGill to start off 2013.
Quinnipiac junior Kelly Babstock leads the ECAC with 20 goals so far this season, but the Crimson looks to counter with its characteristically strong defense. Goaltenders Laura Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer have split time between the pipes for Harvard. The two are arguably the top goalies in the ECAC; Bellamy leads the league in goals-against (0.60) and save percentage (.967), with Maschmeyer a close second in both categories. Maschmeyer leads the ECAC with a .917 win percentage while Bellamy is second at .857.
Another strong contributor on the defensive end will be sophomore Sarah Edney, who missed the Crimson’s most recent outings while playing for the Canadian Women’s Development Team in the 2013 Meco Cup at the turn of the year.
“We’re pretty excited to have [Edney] back,” Bellamy said. “Our defense has been playing great without her, but to have her back will be huge.”
On the other end of the ice, Dempsey has been the primary source of offensive firepower this season for Harvard, leading the team with 16 goals and 15 assists on the year. According to the senior, keys to a successful outcome for the Crimson in this weekend’s test will be continuing its strong defensive play of late as well as both creating and capitalizing on scoring opportunities.
“We’re going to need to get on them right away,” Dempsey said. “It’s going to be really gritty and tough. We have to put pucks on net, to create havoc and better scoring opportunities.”
“We’ve been putting an emphasis on winning every battle,” fellow co-captain Bellamy said. “We want to come out on top with the puck every chance we get.”
Even with a big match-up against Quinnipiac in sight, Harvard will not be overlooking its first opponent of the weekend. The Crimson’s first outing of the season at Princeton ended in a commanding 9-1 victory for Harvard. Junior forward Lyndsey Fry picked up a hat trick, and Dempsey added two goals of her own. But despite the resounding win, the Crimson is sure to avoid underestimate the Tigers.
“I think that they’re going to come out even harder,” Dempsey said. “If they weren’t already going to be hungry because it’s a game and it’s against Harvard, they’re definitely going to have that bitter taste from the last time we played them.”
This weekend’s matches will both be solid tests for the Crimson, as Harvard looks towards the second half of the season and some tough games against ECAC foes.
“There is so much positive energy,” Dempsey said. “The discipline and the hard-work ethic is probably one of the best in my four years here.  I’m really confident in this team, and I have a lot of faith in what we can accomplish this year.”
The Crimson has steadily climbed the national rankings due to its impressive play this season and looks to be a legitimate threat come the end of the year with an eye on postseason play.
“If we stay consistent, and keep having that same mentality and urgency for every single game, every period of every game, I think we can find ourselves in a really good position at the end of the season and definitely make a run at this NCAA title,” Dempsey added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women's swimming and diving team stopped in Miami, Fla. on Friday afternoon for a meet against the Hurricanes to conclude its winter break trip to Puerto Rico. The Crimson (4-0, 3-0 Ivy) topped Miami (1-5, 0-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) 175-86, winning 11 of the 14 events.
"It was a fun meet because it was out of conference," junior captain Sara Li said. "University of Miami is pretty challenging and they have a pretty good reputation, so to beat them was awesome. Every meet we have is practice for what we want to do for championships."
Although the Hurricanes beat Harvard in the first race, the 200 medley relay, by less than a second, the Crimson did not let that set the tone for the meet.
"The first relay didn't go quite as well as we thought, but that was a good thing for us," Li said. "I think it was a good way to test our endurance and make sure everyone knows that no matter what the conditions, good or bad, we just have to learn to get up and race."
Harvard came back to finish first and second in the next three events, earning at least 13 points in each one. In the 400 IM, sophomore Faith Martin stopped the clock at 4:26.33, with freshman Connie Hsu close behind at 4:27.10. Sophomore Courtney Otto and freshman Sherry Liu claimed the 200m freestyle for the Crimson with times of 1:52.55 and 1:52.91, respectively. Liu also took first for Harvard in the 500m freestyle, finishing in 4:57.73.
Freshman Kendall Crawford placed first in the 100m backstroke, clocking in at 56.27 and remaining undefeated in the event in dual meets.
The Hurricanes came back in the 100m breaststroke to take first place, but the Crimson fought back to take the top three spots in the next three events, with solid performances by Otto in the 200m butterfly (2:00.41), and Li in the 50m and 100m freestyle (23.63 and 51.07, respectively).
"[Miami is] definitely a very strong team and they have a history of being a really strong team," Otto said. "I think that was a little intimidating for us at first, but I think we got past that a little bit because we have swum against a team of that caliber."
Junior Danielle Schulkin added to Harvard's stockpile of points with her third place finish in the 200m butterfly in 2:05.31. Senior Ellie Johnson also contributed three points in the 50m freestyle, out-touching Hannah Kling of Miami by .02 seconds with a final time of 24.32. In the 100m freestyle, Martin stopped the clock at 53.55 for her third place points, adding to the Crimson's increasing momentum.
"I thought our team spirit was incredible, and we won a lot of close races, which is something we really need to do if we want to beat [other Ivy schools]," Otto said.
Harvard finished the meet by taking first in all events except the 100 butterfly.  Freshman Danielle Lee led the 200 backstroke, taking first in 1:59.87, just ahead of senior Caroline Weaver.  Weaver clocked in at 2:01.98, nearly 3.5 seconds ahead of third place.
"I thought overall, we did extremely well," Otto said.  "We've been coming off extremely hard training...times were not that impressive, but I think racing-wise we really came together as a team."
Sophomore Stephanie Ferrell had a strong finish as well in the 200 breaststroke (2:19.35), finishing almost five seconds ahead of senior Mackenzie Luick, who took second place for the Crimson at 2:24.69.
Harvard continued to pull away from the Hurricanes with a 1-2-3 finish in the 500 freestyle.  Liu, freshman Marlee Ehrlich, and junior Deirdre Clute sped ahead to finish in 4:57.73, 5:03.36, and 5:15.45, respectively to push the Crimson ahead 16 more points.
The meet concluded with a close 200 IM race and a blow-away 400 freestyle relay.  In the 200 IM, Crawford touched out Miami's Lucy Worrall by .03 seconds to score the Crimson nine points with her time of 2:06.48.  Harvard relay teams of Li, Lee, Liu, Martin and Johnson, Clute, Martin, and freshman Margaret Ramsey took first and second in the 400 freestyle relay in 3:28.37 and 3:34.11, respectively to finish the meet strongly.
"I'm really proud of the team and how we're coming together," Otto said.  "This whole winter break is really important in building team chemistry and I think that we're starting to come together and I'm excited to see what we do this season."

American University edged the Harvard wrestling team, 21-19, in the Crimson’s EIWA dual meet opener Friday night in Washington, D.C. Harvard (1-1, 0-1 EIWA) took five matches on the night but dropped three of the last five as the Eagles (2-2, 0-1 EIWA) captured the home win.
“This match, we had a couple slip-ups,” said sophomore 197-pounder James Fox. “Some things just didn’t go our way in bonus points and at the end of the match.”
After his second week back on the mat after a two-month injury, Fox recorded his first individual win of the season Friday night with a 15-2 major decision over American’s Devon Bradley. The sophomore 197-pounder bounced back after a slow start to his season against Rider last week.
“[Fox] is 100-percent different from last week,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We missed him last semester. [His] coming back is great; he looked really good.”
“This week, I felt a lot better going into my match,” Fox added. “It was just another week under my belt, and my body got used to the intensity of wrestling again.”
Fox forced Bradley to the edge of the mat in the waning stages of the fifth bout of the meet, but the technical fall eluded Fox as time expired.
“I kept going for the pin,” Fox said. “I really wanted that; two extra team points might’ve been the difference tonight.”
Fox’s bout gave the Crimson the largest lead of the night on either side as Harvard enjoyed a 13-6 lead as the teams headed into the back half of the meet. But American closed the gap with a pair of wins in the following two matches.
Eagles heavyweight Blake Herrin defeated Harvard sophomore David Ng, 12-5, to inch within four points of the Crimson.
“David Ng wrestled a tough bout; their guy [Herrin] is tough,” Weiss said.
American followed up the decision with a pin. 125-pounder David Terao recorded a fall over Harvard freshman Jeffrey Ott midway through the third period to put American up, 15-13, with three bouts left. Ott could not escape Terao’s headlock midway through the third.
“I think the key bout was 125,” Weiss said. “[Ott] wrestled a great bout. He was winning the bout deep into the third period. But he gets caught in a headlock, and that’s a nine point swing.”
Harvard made a final push in the eighth and ninth bouts. Sophomore 174-pounder Ryan Osleeb won a 4-2 decision over American’s Esteban Gomes-Rivera, and No. 10 co-captain Steven Keith defeated the Eagles’ John Boyle, 4-1, in the 141-lb. division to put the Crimson ahead, 19-15.
But the two decisions could not outweigh a fall from Eagles 149-pounder Kevin Tao over Crimson sophomore Alexis Wagener in the tenth and final match. The pin swung the contest to American, 21-19.
“I love putting [Wagener] on the mat because I know he’s going to be trying,” Weiss said. “That was a tough one, but we didn’t put together as a team, and we’ve got to figure that out.”
No. 8 Walter Peppelman opened up the meet for Harvard in the 157-pound division with an 18-0 technical fall over the Eagles’ Mark Cirello. The win was the co-captain’s 96th of his career.
American’s Phillip Barreiro responded in the 165-pound division with a 9-4 decision over Crimson freshman Devon Gobbo. At 174-lbs., Harvard junior Cameron Croy earned a major decision over Keithen Cast, 14-6, but American’s Thomas Barreiro earned a narrow 5-4 decision over Crimson sophomore Josh Popple at 184 lbs. to bring the Eagles within three points of the lead.
“Two toss-up matches [in 165 and 184] didn’t go our way; that was frustrating,” Weiss said.
The Crimson grapplers hope to find themselves on the right side of those toss-ups Saturday as they travel to College Park, Md., to face Maryland and Stanford.
“I think we can grow from this,” Fox said. “We can learn.”

The Harvard skiing team will hit the slopes for the first time this season when the alpine racers compete in the Vermont Carnival this weekend. It will be the first time the Crimson has seen competitive action in over ten months, but a veteran core of returning skiers looks to get the 2013 season off to a solid start.
“Individually, everyone has just been working really hard in training,” said junior women’s captain Rebecca Nadler. “We are hoping to carry that [preparation] over to the races.”
Last year Nadler became the first Harvard skier in program history to win an individual NCAA title. The junior took gold in the giant slalom at the 2012 NCAA national championship held in Bozeman, Mont. Her two-run time of 1:41.82 edged runner-up Kate Ryley of Vermont by 0.4 seconds.
Nadler was one of two Crimson skiers representing Harvard at the NCAA championships. Nordic skier Alena Tofte, then a junior, had a strong finish with a 27th place showing on the 5k course and a 35th place finish in the 15k. The pair led the Crimson to a 15th place finish at the NCAA championships.
Earlier in the year, Nadler became the first Harvard skier to win an EISA downhill event when she took first in the giant slalom at the Williams Carnival. Nadler finished the regular season as the East Region’s second ranked female downhill skier in the event and was named to the All-East first team.
The junior will be at the helm of a veteran women’s downhill squad, which features five upperclassmen on its roster. First year Samantha Udolf is the lone newcomer to the women’s alpine contingent.
“The team has been very supportive,” Udolf said. “They’ve been greater role models for the younger guys, like myself and the other freshmen [on the men’s side].”
The Vermont Carnival kicks off the Crimson’s busy regular season schedule, which features seven carnivals in as many weeks, leading up to the EISA Championships. The Nordic skiers will see their first action of the season next weekend, when both the alpine and Nordic squads make their way to Lake Placid, NY for the St. Lawrence Carnival.
With the 2013 season about to start, Harvard looks to improve on its ninth place finish at last year’s EISA Championships.
On the men’s side, the Crimson saw the departure of Kevin McNamara, who was Harvard’s top finisher in the giant slalom at last year’s EISA Championships, finishing 56th in the final event of his Crimson career. Ian Anderson, then a sophomore, was the top Harvard finisher in the slalom with a 48th place finish.
Captain Andrew Spielvogel returns for his senior season after being sidelined by a shoulder injury towards the end of last season.
While the women’s alpine roster is full of upperclassmen, the men’s side features many new, fresh faces. Spielvogel and Anderson are the only returnees and will be leading a team that features five freshmen.
“We are really excited about the men’s team this year,” Nadler said. “They’ve been working really hard and have improved a lot.”
Despite falling a bit earlier than usual, the Vermont Carnival will give the Crimson the opportunity to put its offseason work to the test.
“Usually we have an extra week or so to prepare for our first carnival,” Nadler said. “We are all just [going to] try to do our best.”
Harvard will face some stiff competition including host Vermont. The Catamounts are the reigning national champions after running away with the title at last year’s NCAA championships. Vermont’s 832.0 point total eclipsed second place finisher Utah’s aggregate score by 161.0 points.
“I’m definitely looking forward to my first race,” Udolf said. “We’ve done a lot of training to prepare for our first carnival.”

With the Harvard men’s basketball team tipping off its conference slate against Dartmouth Saturday, The Back Page takes a look at some of the biggest surprises and disappointments both at Harvard and around the Ivy League before the beginning of the conference season.The biggest surprise of the season to date for Harvard has been freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. The Golden Valley, Minnesota native ranks first in the Ivy League with 6.0 assists a game. His 89.8 percent mark from the free throw line also leads the conference. Chambers has scored in double digits in all but four games this season and has averaged 7.2 assists over his last five games. After the departure of Oliver McNally and Keith Wright, as well as Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey, Chambers and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders have helped fill the scoring void for the Crimson. Chambers has been at his best when the team needs it most, posting 21 points, five assists and three steals in a win against ACC foe Boston College and making all five of his three-point attempts against St. Mary’s, finishing with 16 points and seven assists in a narrow loss.
The biggest disappointment of the season to date for the Crimson, has been the team’s inability to close in its few chances to notch statement nonconference wins. Against St. Mary’s, the Crimson led by as many as 18 points in the first half and 10 with four minutes to go. Against UMass, Harvard took a five-point lead on a pair of Saunders free throws with 81 seconds left but then gave up eight unanswered points to finish the game without hoisting even a single shot (the Crimson turned it over on both possessions). The team’s last chance for a marquee win comes next Saturday against Josh Pastner’s Memphis squad.
After being picked third in the conference’s preseason poll, the Columbia Lions have been the biggest surprise thus far into their nonconference slate in an Ivy League that (with the exception of Princeton and Penn, who has stumbled to a 2-12 start) stands at the onset of nonconference play almost as predicted. The Lions hold an impressive +5.4 scoring margin and lead the Ancient Eight in free throw percentage and are second in three-point percentage. The Lions rarely turn the ball over and their assist-to-turnover ratio is best in the league as a result. Despite ranking in the middle of the pack in steals and blocked shots, Columbia is the best defensive rebounding team in the league and holds opponents to just 41.7 percent shooting, a statistic that bodes well for the Lions as they begin league play next Saturday at home against Cornell.
Nearly unanimously selected to be first in the conference’s preseason poll, the Princeton Tigers have been a bit of a disappointment with a slow start to begin the season. Star senior forward Ian Hummer has produced as expected (16.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game), but the team stumbled out of the gates to a 3-6 record and only scored 42 points in an overtime loss to Wagner. The team has dropped six decisions by seven or less points, with the other being a 20-point loss to Syracuse in the Carrier Dome, but has won three of four heading into Ivy League play.

Two Harvard athletes were named to Business Insider’s list of the 22 most impressive students at Harvard on Tuesday. The list, which features predominantly seniors, includes cancer researchers, business founders, and published writers.
The list recognized alpine skier Rebecca Nadler, who made history last year when she became the first Harvard skier to win a national title. In her years as a Crimson skier, the junior has taken the alpine program to new heights, handing Harvard its first EISA carnival win and becoming the first to attend NCAAs.
In her quest for the title, Nadler edged rival Kate Ryley of the University of Vermont by .38 seconds, cruising to victory in the giant slalom with one of the widest margins in recent NCAA history.
In addition to Nadler, the list highlighted senior running back Treavor Scales, who was also named one of the Crimson’s 15 seniors to meet before they graduate. Scales is best known for his heroics on the field, most recently a 63-yard touchdown run to hand Harvard its sixth straight victory over Yale in November.
Scales’ flashy ending was just another demonstration of what he did for Harvard football his entire career. Scales made the all-conference team four straight years, leading the league in rushing as a senior.
In addition to Scales’ football career, Business Insider focused on the running back’s academic pursuits. In earning a German language citation, the economics concentrator performed in a play last spring for his German Drama and Theater class and is also involved in DAPA.

Friday night’s matchup pitted two teams on almost opposite journeys. The overhauled Houston Rockets came into the season expectation-free after shaking up their starting lineup but got off to a hot start nonetheless.
But the upstarts couldn’t contend with a veteran Celtics team fighting on its home court to redeem itself after a slow start to the season, as Houston fell, 103-91.
The Celtics had to fight for their victory after almost letting a 17-point lead slip away in the fourth quarter. Sparked by a Carlos Delfino three-pointer, Houston went on a 12-0 run to pull within two. However, the Rockets couldn’t keep up their offensive pace, and they were outscored 20-10 to close out the game.
Both teams struggled from the foul line—with Boston never reaching the stripe in the first half—but the Celtics made up for it by knocking down 75 percent of their free throws in the third and fourth quarters, while the Rockets shot only 41.4 percent from the stripe throughout the game.
Lin—largely kept from the paint by a strong Celtics defense—added 12 points behind teammates Harden and Chandler Parsons, who led the team with 24 and 18 points, respectively. The guard was crucial on defense, tallying a team-high three steals and six assists, while adding four defensive rebounds in 36 minutes of play.
In the Celtics’ fifth straight win—their longest winning streak of the season—Paul Pierce led the team with 23 points. Boston also benefited from a deep bench, which outscored the Rockets’ bench by almost 100 percent, adding 40 points to Houston’s 25.
After winning five straight and 10 of 12 before suffering back-to-back losses at the hands of the Hornets and the Celtics, the Rockets will seek to right the ship against the 76ers tomorrow evening.

HANOVER, N.H.—“Let’s Go!” Siyani Chambers’ exclamation was audible over the crowd of 997 gathered at Dartmouth’s Leede Arena for the Big Green’s Ivy opener against the Harvard men’s basketball team.
The rookie point guard had reason to be excited. After all, he had just kept the Crimson (9-5, 1-0 Ivy) from suffering its worst loss of the season in his first-ever conference matchup.
With underdog Dartmouth (3-11, 0-1) leading by five with 8:43 to play, Chambers added nine points, two assists, and two rebounds in the final 7:33, fueling a 17-2 game-ending run that put Harvard on top, 75-65, at the final buzzer.
“What an effort, I thought, by Siyani,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of the rookie, who finished with a career-high 22 points and six assists—both game highs,
While Chambers got it done offensively, the entire Crimson lineup chipped in defensively down the stretch. After starting the second half shooting 9 of 18 from the field, the Big Green closed the contest 0 of 8—its lone points coming off two Jvonte Brooks free throws.
“I thought we dug in,” Amaker said. “We did a tremendous job of playing our D without fouling. That was key.”
The Crimson also got it done on the glass. After surrendering 11 offensive rebounds over the first 31:17—which turned into 19 second-chance points for the Big Green—Harvard gave up just one down the stretch.
Perhaps overshadowed by Chambers’ late-game prowess was the play of sophomore Wesley Saunders. The wing finished with 19 points on eight-of-nine shooting and matched Chambers with six assists. Saunders has scored in double-figures every game this season.
Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi contributed a season-high 15 points off the bench, and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard added 12 points, all of which came in the opening frame.
Dartmouth boasted balanced scoring with seven players finishing with at least two baskets. Rookies Alex Mitola and Connor Boehm led the way with 11 points apiece.
“Dartmouth is a team that we think is better than their record indicates,” Amaker said. “They’re always going to play people very, very tough, especially [at home].”
Riding the hot shooting of Rivard and the play of Moundou-Missi, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead.
Moundou-Missi came off the bench with 15:26 remaining and immediately made his presence felt, scoring five baskets in a five-minute stretch. His final basket of the half put the Crimson up 10, 25-15, with 10:43 to go. The Crimson took its largest lead of the period, 34-20, with 8:28 to go after Chambers knocked down a three-pointer.
But it was all Dartmouth from there, as the Big Green—fueled by forward Gabas Maldunas’s four baskets—closed the frame on a 23-8 run and went into the break up one, 43-42.
“We had a stretch where we didn’t play up to our standards,” Chambers said. “We can’t have those stretches.”
Just 2:41 into the second half, the Big Green extended its lead to five, 50-45, off a Brooks jump shot. The Crimson evened the score at 56 with 11:51 to go, but Dartmouth went back up by five with 8:43 to go following a Malik Gill layup and a Brooks free throw.
That’s when Chambers stepped up. The rookie found Saunders for a deep two and then finished an and-one layup against Mitola to even the score at 63.
Following a Brooks travel, Saunders attacked the basket for two to give the Crimson the lead. Mitola turned it over on the other end, and Chambers pushed Harvard’s lead to four with a floater as the shot clock expired.
The Crimson’s lead grew from there, as Saunders stuck another layup and Chambers hit two free throws and then found Moundou-Missi open under the basket for an easy dunk.
The rookie tacked on two more off a mid-range jumper with 39 seconds remaining, setting the final score at 75-65.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 322 days since the last time the Harvard alpine skiing team was on competitive snow, the team is back on the slopes.
Key performances from rookies helped the team kick off the season when the alpine skiers made the trek this weekend to Stowe, Vt. to begin its EISA competition at the Vermont Carnival, where the team took 11th place out of 13 teams.
“This is our first trial of the season, and we have a lot of freshmen where this is their first time on the carnival scene,” junior Rebecca Nadler said. ”Our men’s team had their best finish in, I don’t even know how long, and we had two men in the top 30, which was really great for us. There was a lot of soft snow, so there were a lot of big bumps and big gusts, but everyone did a really good job battling it out and working hard to get some finishes in.”
Nadler, who raced to a first-ever NCAA title for the Crimson last year and helped her team take ninth at the EISA championships as a sophomore, highlighted the women’s side of the competition for Harvard, coming in second in her first race of the giant slalom event. But tricky conditions led to a tougher second run, yielding an 11th-place overall finish for the junior in the event.
“[Her race] was difficult because the snow was pretty soft, and it deteriorated a lot in the second run, and that was obviously a little bit of a bummer,” Harvard coach Tim Mitchell said.
Nadler also spearheaded Harvard’s effort on the second day in the slalom race, finishing in the 14th spot out of over 80 skiers. But even with a title under Nadler’s belt and some early success, Mitchell doesn’t see anything as a given for the junior’s season.
“She put down a really good time, a second-place run in the first race of the season, so that was good, but the consistency right now is not quite there from her yet,” Mitchell said. “Once she gets on track, she’ll be right where she was last year. She’s prepared very well, but you can’t control how anybody races. [There are skiers] from UVM and Dartmouth that are phenomenal, way above the level that they skied at last year, so Rebecca’s definitely capable of having the year that she had last year, but you can only control your own results.”
Senior Catherine Sheils came in 39th in the giant slalom event and earned NCAA points with her 24th-place finish in the slalom race. Also contributing were sophomore Liz Strong, who took 50th in the giant slalom, and freshman Samantha Udolf, who skied to a 43rd-place finish in the slalom.
“[Udolf’s] racing at a completely different level than she’s ever been exposed to, so it’s not just one step up in the competition level for her, it’s three or four steps up, so we weren’t necessarily knowing what to expect of her,” Mitchell said. “She was maybe a little bit overwhelmed, which is very easy to do since you’re racing against some people who are competing on the World Cup circuit as well as racing for their coach. It’s about the highest level of competition that you can get in any college sport, so it’s a pretty tall act for someone like her to step up.”
Freshmen performances paved the way on the men’s side, where freshman Matthew Mansson qualified for a second run and placed 41st in the grand slalom, while in the slalom event, freshman Simon Merryweather and junior Ian Anderson cracked the top 30, placing 20th and 24th respectively, to earn points towards their NCAA totals. Merryweather’s finish was particularly impressive considering he started in the 76th position in the second race after a slower first run.
“That’s a huge, huge move as a freshman—first collegiate race. We were really excited to see that,” Mitchell said. “Ian Anderson also finished inside the top 30, and that’s really important because when you’re finishing inside the top 30, you’re scoring points, not only for the team result, but for your own individual standing within the league, which affects your start position. That’s really important, because the later back you start, the course is kind of chewed up and bumpy and runny.”
While some of the individual results weren’t necessarily what Mitchell was hoping for, he attributes some of them to the rust that comes with a late start in training that the Crimson had in comparison to UVM, which had a commanding win at the carnival with 422 points.
“We’re going up against teams like UVM, which have basically been training and racing since the middle of November, and they went up to Colorado for a couple of weeks in November, and then up to Canada and skied there some more,” Mitchell said. “They’ve been going for a month and a half nonstop, so we’re definitely playing catch-up right now, and it’s pretty apparent. That being said, I actually think, given the amount of skiing we had, we’re ahead of where I expected us to be at this point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first half of its weekend doubleheader, the Harvard men’s squash team (8-0, 2-0) defeated Penn (3-3, 0-1), 9-0 at the Ringe Squash Courts Saturday. The No. 13 Quakers did not win a game against the No. 3 Crimson. Harvard travels Sunday to take on the top-ranked Princeton Tigers, who are undefeated on the year and have won each contest by a 7-2 or better margin.
“I thought the team played really well today,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “We clearly realized that we were the favorite and the better team going into today and everyone took it seriously. We really executed our game plan on and off the court quickly and didn’t mess around.”
At the top ranked spot, junior Ali Farag defeated opponent Danny Greenberg 11-1, 11-1, 11-7, surrendering the fewest points of any Crimson player on the day. Later, line three junior Gary Power and line four sophomore Tyler Olson defeated their Quaker opponents by identical 11-7, 11-6, 11-5 scores.
“I look up and down the lineup and I see that every player is playing up to their potential if not above, and that’s pretty great,” Scherl said. “I can see the players coming off court and going on court and it’s a professional, mature group down the roster.”
At line nine, freshman Matt Roberts scored his team-leading fifth win of the season against Quaker junior Daniel Judd. Roberts had a tight first set against Judd, winning 15-13 in what would be the closest set of the day. However, Roberts bounced back and took the final two sets 11-1 and 11-6 to close out the victory.
The win was Harvard’s fourth consecutive victory by a 9-0 margin and its seventh overall. Against Princeton, the defending national champions, the Crimson is winless in regular season play during co-captain Jason Michas’ four years with the team.
“We’re very excited to play them and it’ll be a good match for us,” Michas said. “We respect how good they have been in the past and how good the players are and we know we have to play really well tomorrow to have a good result.”
 
According to Scherl, this year’s squad—which brought back eight of last year’s top nine players—had time last offseason for an introspective look at its season and has come back with increased focus.
“Last year’s team was a less mature version of this year’s team,” Scherl said. “We didn’t perform as well as we wanted last year and we talked about that with our coaches and it came down to a mindset and mental attitude that we adopted this year. I think tomorrow will be a great test and great indicator for the rest of the season for us.”
The entire team, which is the largest it has been in the last four years, traveled for this weekend’s matches. Michas said that the experience of traveling with the entire team has buoyed the top nine and brought the team closer together.
“This is actually a really fun trip for the team as a whole,” Michas said. “Seeing everyone who’s there at practice behind the courts cheering for us is big. We’re all digging deep in the trenches working in practice and seeing them behind us at matches is great.”
Scherl said he does not see any mismatches between the two teams.
“We are trying to approach it as professionally as possible and we know that if we stick to our basics that we are definitely good enough to beat this team,” Scherl said. “It’s a great team we have thus far and looking down Princeton’s lineup and looking down ours I think that there is nothing certain but we can definitely compete with them. Everyone needs to show up as they’ve been showing up recently and play great squash but I think everyone is in great form.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Penn threatened to erase Harvard’s early 3-0 lead, senior Laura Gemmell faced a 2-1 game deficit at the No. 2 position. But the Crimson senior rallied with a hard-fought 11-9 victory in the fourth game and a commanding 11-4 win in the fifth to place Harvard firmly in control of the team match with its fourth point of the day.
Thanks to Gemmell’s performance, the No. 1 Crimson women’s squash team won its most challenging match yet this season against the No. 5 Quakers, 6-3, Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia. Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) yielded its first individual matches of the season but managed to hand Penn (4-1, 0-1 Ivy) its first loss.
“As a team, we’ve been looking to this match for the last couple of months,” co-captain Natasha Kinshott said. “We all really rose to the occasion.”
Harvard swept the first wave of individual matches at the No. 3, No. 6 and No. 9 positions.
At the No. 3 position, sophomore Haley Mendez secured Harvard’s first of two five-game victories. Mendez earned consecutive 11-4 wins in her fourth and fifth games to deliver a 3-2 win over Penn’s Rachael Goh, 7-11, 12-10, 2-11, 11-4, 11-4.
At No. 6, Kingshott earned a clean decision over the Quakers’ Yarden Odinak, winning in straight games, 11-2, 11-7, 11-9. The senior entered the match with something extra to prove.
“I’ve played [Odinak] since I was playing in my junior circuit, so I know her game very well.” Kingshott said. “I hadn’t beaten her in a couple of years, so I was really motivated and focused on this match in particular because of the history.”
Sophomore Julianne Chu also went wire-to-wire for Harvard, defeating freshman Alisa Agnew in straight sets, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, at the No. 9 position.
Penn responded with a pair of four-game victories over Harvard freshmen in the next wave of matches. At the No. 5 position, Quaker senior Pia Trikha defeated Saumya Karki, 8-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-5, and Penn freshman Camille Lanier defeated Isabelle Dowling, 11-6, 8-11, 13-11, 11-4, at No. 8.
“I’m really proud of the freshmen in particular,” Kingshott said. “Even though the scores of their particular matches may not reflect their results, they fought so hard.”
Harvard’s third loss of the day also involved two first-year players. Crimson freshman Michelle Gemmell climbed out of a 2-0 hole to force a fifth game but fell to Quaker freshman Haidi Lala, 11-5, 11-9, 12-14, 9-11, 11-4.
“[Michelle] played well; she had a tough match,” Laura Gemmell said of her younger sister. “I think she is going to build on this tomorrow [versus Princeton].”
Harvard sealed the match with a pair of come-from-behind wins at No. 2 and No. 7.
Laura Gemmell took freshman Yan Xin to five games at the No. 2 position to earn the Crimson’s fourth point of the match, 9-11, 11-5, 6-11, 11-9, 11-4.
“Laura dug really deep,” Kingshott said. “You could see that she was really fired up.”
“I had beaten [Xin] in October, but I knew she was going to be a very strong opponent,” Gemmell added. “I was really happy with the way I played. I kind of just grit it out and tried to return as many volleys as possible.”
At the No. 7 position, co-captain Sarah Mumanachit spotted Penn’s Courntey Jones a game but took control in the next three to produce the clinching fifth point, 8-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-5.
“[Mumanachit] really hustled and never gave up,” Kingshott said. “It was just so gratifying that the two other seniors—Laura and Sarah—got the two victories for us that clinched the win.”
The day concluded with a drama-free match at No. 1 as sophomore Amanda Sobhy rolled over Penn’s Nabilla Ariffin. The reigning individual national champion cruised, 11-3, 11-4, 11-3, to record Harvard’s sixth and final point of the day.
