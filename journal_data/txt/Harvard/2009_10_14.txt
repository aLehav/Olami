After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucker Max, author of “I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell,” fascinates me. Not only has he voluntarily defined himself as a “raging dickhead,” but he also epitomizes stereotyped masculinity. His self-construction as an unapologetic incarnation of the male id—that force that craves sexual gratification, whose libidinal energies know no economy and no limit—appears disingenuous, in part because it adheres so closely to cultural cliches. Regardless of the veracity of his sexist ramblings, Max’s beer-pounding, sex-crazed, female-objectifying persona seems too ready-made to be real. After reading one of his war stories, each of which features an incredulous diversity of bodily fluids and misogynous one-liners, the question inevitability arises: Is Max an actual flesh-and-blood human being, or a stock character from an unoriginal beer commercial populated with breasty twins? Even his name—Tucker Max—reads like a bad advertising slogan.
Max has pathologically appropriated every trope of steroid-supplemented masculinity imaginable. He has detached, unemotional sex; he objectifies women; he frequents strip clubs. As Max asserted in a recent interview, “There aren’t a whole lot of people in culture that are unapologetically masculine,” implying, of course, that he numbers among the lucky few. Claiming absolute ownership of the term “masculinity,” Max purports to speak for all heterosexual men. His appeal, it seems, lies in his ability to replay all of their sexual fantasies, frustrated by such inconveniences as feminism and statutory rape. Elevating hackneyed myths of masculinity to the status of reality, Max’s writing raises a salient question: What consequences ensue when our cultural Punch-and-Judys appear as actual, embodied people? Moreover, what happens when these walking stereotypes assume the prerogative to legislate the male ideal—and, by extension, the female ideal, defined as it is in relation to the former? And what does this say about the tenuous line our culture draws between reality and representation?
The unfortunate success of Max’s endeavor speaks to the formative power of gendered stereotypes. Marked, in his own words, by a sort of philandering cretinism, Max resists intellectual analysis. Yet there is something undeniably postmodern about him—he appears as a pastiche of the very stereotypic images which he conveys in his writing. Constructed by the forces over which he claims creative agency, Max, as Dorothy Parker would quip, is “trapped, like a trap in a trap.” With their images of males, females, sex, and sexuality, Max’s yarns locate themselves within a loaded semiotic field. Yet, rather than subverting the stereotypes he embraces, Max merely reinforces them, then relishes in his complicity.
The media constantly represent our actions for us, even our most intimate gestures. We watch kisses romantically rendered on the silver screen, then wonder where our personal paradigms of smooching originate. Are we simply mimicking the scene from the movie, or are we acting in accord with some sort of natural, authentic urge? In today’s mediated culture, it’s difficult to tell what portions of our identities we truly own and what portions are mere media creations. Max’s popularity inheres in his self-portrayal as the latter: He is the generalized image, the disembodied pose, par excellence. “My name is Tucker Max, and I am an asshole,” reads the first sentence on his website; for both his fans and his critics, Max’s identity need not possess any more nuance. The bleach-blonde female posing with him is similarly abstracted. Her face censored by the bland phrase “your face here,” she too becomes a stock character.
Beyond his reification of females as sex objects, what makes Max so insidious is his conflation of not only his own identity, but also masculinity itself, with pure stereotype. Indeed, when contributors to Urban Dictionary define Tucker Max as “the ideal example of ‘the Man,’” “the role model of every guy on Earth,” and even “Jesus” incarnate, it’s difficult to detect whether they are being ironic or sincere. There is certainly comedy in the fact that nearly all of Max’s actions comply with the most threadbare caricatures of masculinity—yet gag gifts don’t make three-year runs on the New York Times bestseller list. Commoditized for a mass audience, misogyny sells.
Deriding Max for his sexism is like Bruno lampooning Southern pastors for their homophobia: It’s almost too easy to be fun. Personalizing the anonymous force of patriarchy writ large, Max makes himself an obvious target. Impugning the stereotype for self-consciously being a stereotype is a worthwhile, yet circular, endeavor. As readers, we possess no means to distinguish the truth of Max’s stories from his fabrications and exaggerations; in his writing, the real blends seamlessly with the representation of the real. Sadly, we cannot simply snub Max’s work as a self-indulgent exercise in free speech. By valorizing the spectacle and the gendered stereotype, Max’s writings prove the continued relevance of both.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Google “Social Studies,”  and the homepage for the rigorous, interdisciplinary, application-only “Harvard of Harvard  concentrations” will come up second. The top hit? SocialStudiesforkids.com, a site devoted  to helping kids grades K-5 answer such pressing questions as “What  is a place?” and “How can I make a mental map?” This is what the  name “Social Studies” means outside of Harvard, and it  is exactly why the degree program must change its name.
True, Harvard doesn’t normally  sacrifice precision for mellifluousness when it comes to titles. The  College offers a concentration in “Government” rather than “Political  Science” because the department did not originally do scientific work. One can concentrate in “Organismic  and Evolutionary Biology” or “Molecular and Cellular Biology,”  but not simply “Biology” because that name does not encourage “learning in breadth  and learning in depth.”  Heck, even the term “concentration”—as opposed to the  clearer, more commonly used word “major”—is a  Harvard-ism.
But it’s not for themselves  that the Social Studies faculty should be concerned when it comes to  the concentration’s title. It’s for their students.
Year after year, Social Studies  concentrators are forced to bear the stigma  of the grade-school name that their plan of study carries. Within Harvard,  the childishness of this name matters very little, because those in  the know understand that Social Studies concentrators definitely earn  their keep. In addition to braving the grueling  sophomore tutorial, the honors-only concentrators are  trained by top-notch professors in the fields of  human rights, global health policy, and political theory. Beyond the  Harvard bubble, though, the first reaction Social Studies concentrators  get when they tell others what they’re studying is either a snicker  or a confused stare. Rather than receiving accolades for breaking their  heads on Smith, Mill, Marx, Durkheim, and Hegel, they get: “But  you’re in college now, aren’t you?”
Sure, students  can explain that they are indeed in college and that, yes, they are  in fact studying material above the fifth grade level. But such rationales  will unfortunately never appear on a  transcript or an actual degree. It’s hard to imagine a spectator looking  at the diploma on your wall giving an impressed whistle and patting  you on the back for mastering the art of map coloring.
Such  anguish could be avoided with an effortless name  change to either “Social and Political  Theory” or “Social Thought.”  Indeed, although “Social Studies” may  seem to be the best title for a concentration that employs “an integrated approach to the study  of social phenomena,” plenty of similar programs exist with names  that don’t remind outsiders of diorama projects.  First instituted at Oxford in the 1920s,  the degree program “Philosophy, Politics, and Economics” (PPE)  offers an almost identical academic experience as Social Studies  does without the juvenile title. PPE  is now offered, in some form or another, at Yale, Duke, Notre  Dame, and the University of Pennsylvania. The  description of Yale’s program in  “Ethics, Politics, and Economics,” for instance,  is nearly identical to Social Studies’:  it joins the “analytic rigor of the social sciences”  with the “enduring normative questions of philosophy” to  explore the “institutions, practices, and policies” of the modern  era.
True, the name  “Social Studies” carries the weight of nearly  five decades of blood, sweat, and  tears, while a  name like “PPE” does not. But the nostalgia should be left to the  professors. The students are the ones who will need to tell their grandchildren  what they studied as an undergraduate.  A sign by the Radcliffe Quadrangle currently advertises the main offices  for “Social Studies” right next to the  “Quad Library.” Now that the latter’s appearance on that sign  is an anachronism, hopefully the former  can follow suit.

This November, President Drew G. Faust will be traveling to South Africa and Botswana. To help our girl out, FM decided to put together a short list of tips to make sure her trip goes smoothly.
1. While you may be tempted to show off your Cambridge-style cruising skills, it’s probably not best to drive yourself. In rural areas, livestock tend to wander into the streets; you do not want to be known as “cow killer” for the rest of your trip.
2. As when traveling to any foreign country, remember to keep your valuables closeby. May FM suggest a leg safe?
3. Make sure you take your malaria tablets. Accept no dares (or double dares) to forgo these pills. They may give you extremely realistic nightmares, but isn’t that better than the alternative? And while we’re on the subject of health, it can’t hurt to get vaccinations for measles, hepatitis A and B, typhoid, and rabies. After all, UHS is just a short walk away from your office.
4. While it may be extra difficult to talk the talk, it’s good to know the official languages of each country and how many people actually speak them. There are nearly 30 different languages spoken in both Botswana and South Africa. In fact, South Africa alone has 11 official languages. Don’t assume that people speak English — but never assume that they don’t.
5. Rhinos are a critically endangered species, so if one charges at you while you’re on safari, DO NOT SHOOT IT. FM’s advice: practice climbing trees as part of your trip preparations. We promise we won’t be shocked when we see you scaling the foliage in Harvard Yard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two former high-level presidential advisers took the stage at the John F. Kennedy forum yesterday, reflecting on lessons learned while working in the White House and looking to the present day to offer guidance for President Barack Obama’s administration.
Ted Sorensen—who served as special counsel, adviser, and speech writer to John F. Kennedy ’40—and Ken Duberstein—the White House chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan—each provided advice to the current administration about the best strategies for governing effectively.
Sorensen said he would like to see the Obama administration move out of permanent campaign mode.
“Once you’re president you don’t need to worry about what’s going to be in the Washington Post,” he said. “He’s got a long time before he’s got to start his re-election campaign.”
The two former officials touched on the subject of a recent leak in The New York Times in which the president had asked New York Governor David A. Paterson not to seek re-election.
Duberstein suggested the leak may have been intentional.
“I may say about the governor of New York, it looked to me like it was a planned leak,” he said.
Duberstein offered some general advice for the administration.
“Governing is not about 100 percent solutions, it’s about 80 percent solutions,” he said.
Dubserstein added that Reagan used to tell his subordinates that he would compromise with the other side of the aisle in order to achieve most of his objectives.
According to Christopher J. Hollyday ’11, the chairman of the IOP’s forum committee, between 200 and 300 people attended the event, which was simultaneously broadcast on CSPAN’s Web site.
The event will be replayed on the CSPAN broadcast station tomorrow evening, according to Bill P. Purcell, director of the Institute of Politics.
“It’s not unheard of,” Purcell said about the event airing on the public affairs cable network, “but it tells you this was a very special event.”
Sorensen and Duberstein, both former White House heavyweights, answered questions from David Gergen, the director of the Center for Public Leadership, a Harvard professor, and former presidential adviser himself, on a variety of subjects.
Besides discussing the current administration, both Sorensen and Duberstein addressed major obstacles they had to face during their times in the White House.
Sorensen spoke about the Kennedy administration’s handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis, while Duberstein, who took over after the Iran-Contra scandal, told the audience about how he worked to help recover Reagan’s then deflated image.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Professor Ichiro Kawachi, induction into the Institute of Medicine is “like getting voted into the baseball hall of fame.” And this year, he’s far from alone at Harvard—which provided 11 of the IOM’s 65 new members announced this week.
Although an organization largely dedicated to recognizing research, the IOM is also viewed as one of the most important branches of the National Academies—an influential advisory group on science, engineering, and medicine.
When asked why Harvard faculty members represent such a large proportion of this year’s new inductees, Cell Biology Professor Alfred L. Goldberg ’63 said that “Harvard is a particularly strong center for medical research.”
Isaac S. Kohane, a professor of pediatrics at the Medical School, added that the “stimulating environment [of Harvard] allows many novel ideas to be pursued.”
Kohane also said that the intellectual environment at Harvard is as diverse as it is progressive. The breadth of research that the newly-inducted professors have conducted is evidenced by their range of study—while one professor sought to sequence the genome of a parasitic worm, another applied computer models to disease outbreak.
Many recipients appeared to harbor a humility best articulated by Genetics Professor Gary B. Ruvkun, who said that “in my particular case...I could have imagined that the medical community wouldn’t have taken notice [of my work].”
All of the inductees interviewed by The Crimson echoed these sentiments, downplaying the significance of their research projects.
Ruvkun said that the great diversity of projects acknowledged represents not only the abilities of the inductees but also a “broadening of the taste of the medical community.”
In addition to Kawachi, Goldberg, Kohane, and Ruvkun, the Harvard professors recognized by the IOM include Sue J. Goldie, Daniel A. Haber, Joan Y. Reede, Clifford B. Saper, Megan Sykes, Bruce D. Walker, and Ralph Weissleder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven months after its creation, a task force chaired by University Provost Steven E. Hyman is poised to recommend fundamental changes to Harvard’s library system this semester, with an eye toward cutting costs and centralizing its administrative structure.
Though the University Library Task Force’s preliminary recommendations remain vague, representatives identified establishing and implementing “a shared administrative infrastructure” and more efficiently acquiring materials for “a single University collection” at an open meeting Friday where Hyman was not present.
“One of the significant findings of the task force is that the decentralized structure is one of the problems that the library system is facing at the present,” said Divinity School Professor David C. Lamberth, who chaired one of the task force’s four subcommittees.
But the prospect of consolidation has some librarians and humanities professors concerned about the future of the libraries, which have already suffered from layoffs, buyouts, and hour reductions.
Harvard College Library reduced its work force by roughly 100 employees this year—after 20 staff layoffs, 52 voluntary retirements, the elimination of 20 open job positions, and a reduction in work hours for several others—impacting not only front-desk staffers, but also librarians who acquire new books.
And while acquisition costs have ballooned with the amount of published material that is currently being produced—both digitally and in print—the libraries’ unrestricted budget has remained stagnant since the beginning of the decade, according to Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas. Now, he adds, it has been cut.
“In terms of keeping up with theJoneses, we’re supposed to be the Joneses,” said History of Art and Architecture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger—an outspoken regular at Faculty meetings—who said he is concerned that Yale and Princeton may now have higher rates of acquisition than Harvard. “[The library] is one of the few things that makes Harvard what it is in a meaningful sense.”
University spokesman Kevin Galvin—who answered questions by e-mail on Hyman’s behalf—wrote that it is “too early” to rule out whether some libraries may close as a result of restructuring.
“I think it would be a mistake for us to be saying there’s no chance that there will be fewer independent libraries at the end of this process,” said Law School Professor John G. Palfrey ’94, who chaired the task force’s subcommittee on technological futures.
In addition to recommending a shared administrative infrastructure, Lamberth and Palfrey described proposals to integrate different libraries’ IT systems, revamp the libraries’ financial model, and collaborate more with peer libraries and other institutions.
The Harvard Corporation—the University’s chief governing body—is poised to discuss the task force’s recommendations and to consider the task force’s mission statement for the libraries at their next meeting, according to Harvard University Library Director Robert C. Darnton ’60.
Hyman is also planning to soon appoint librarians and professors to implement the final proposal.
Palfrey pointed both to current financial constraints and the longer-term need to modernize Harvard’s library system as the impetus for reviewing the library system now.
Galvin wrote in an e-mailed statement that even before the financial crisis, “it was generally recognized that the Schools and the libraries must work together more closely to address the research needs of students and faculty.”
Now, he wrote, the plunge in the endowment has heightened the need to “consider the benefits of a shared administrative structure.”
But some faculty members remain concerned that the libraries will benefit little from potential structural changes.
“I in fact don’t think the Corporation understands what is happening here at all in many ways,” said Thomas, the classics professor, at Friday’s meeting, expressing concern that restructuring the library system now may be used as an excuse for deeper staff cuts at the libraries.
Hamburger, the history of art and architecture professor, added that he finds the current pace of acquisition to be already worrisome. He says he keeps a list of titles in his field of research which the library “for some reason or another has failed to purchase,” and that over the past decade, that list has grown at an ever-rising rate—now to at least 100 books per year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen W. Lagakos, a long-time Harvard biostatistics professor whom colleagues remembered for his scientific leadership and personal warmth, died in a car crash Monday.
His Toyota Highlander burst into flames after it swerved across the center line of Route 202 in New Hampshire and collided with a Chevy Malibu, leaving his wife Regina, his mother Helen, and the other driver dead at the scene. Lagakos was 63.
At the School of Public Health, Lagakos founded the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research and pioneered new methodologies to estimate life spans for AIDS patients and transmission of HIV from mothers to their children during pregnancy.
One colleague, Michael D. Hughes, said he still remembers how Lagakos helped him to “focus on the big picture, doing things that could effect public health and not focus on small details.”
“What he taught me to do was to think about pulling together a big collaboration of academic groups and pharmaceutical companies to really validate surrogate endpoints in the HIV setting,” Hughes said.
While his colleagues respected him for his eclectic approach to problem-solving, they all fondly recalled the influence Lagakos’s leadership had beyond the workplace. “I’m going to miss him dearly as a friend,” said Lee-Jen Wei, a professor of biostatistics, whose sons were also good friends with Lagakos’s.
“He wanted to know, in a very kind way, what was going on in your life, what interested you,” Hughes said. “He was interested in your family and things you liked to do.”
Hughes recalled the in-depth discussions about academic subjects that he and Lagakos frequently engaged in. “You didn’t have to worry about stepping on his toes,” he said. “You could have disagreements with him and still end up with a humorous discussion.”
“He was the kind of person who could not say ‘no,’” Wei added. “If I said ‘no’ to him, he’d probably want to figure out why. Most of the time, he was right.”
Lagakos also continually challenged himself outside of the classroom. This past summer, he took a solo motorcycle trip from Boston to the West Coast and back, stopping by Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. He also recently climbed Mt. Washington, a 6,288-foot peak in New Hampshire.
During his time as department chair, Lagakos would invite some of his students and colleagues to hike to his cottage atop Mt. Monadnock for picnics.
“He was always there to celebrate work and to celebrate life,” said Victor De Gruttola, the current chair of the biostatistics department. “He mixed that capacity for enjoyment for life with his enjoyment for statistics, for getting things right, for being accurate, and he showed why it was exciting and not just a chore.”
De Gruttola, who had known Lagakos for 27 years, called his death “just a tragic day for us at Harvard.”
“I’ll miss the joy, his enthusiasm, and his tremendous generosity in helping people create careers,” he said.
Lagakos is survived by his two sons, David and Adrian.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking through Harvard Yard this fall, it is hard to miss the brightly-colored chairs ordered by University President Drew G. Faust’s common spaces initiative, but the performing artists meant to entertain those sitting in the chairs are not always so obvious.
Last Friday, Banda Roncati—an Italian marching band that was in town to play in that weekend’s Honk Parade—performed in the open space between the Science Center and the yard despite the drizzling rain.
Though not heavily publicized, the band attracted a diverse crowd of about 40, including small children and parents, tourists walking through campus, and several sections of “Italian C” students.
Brian D. Goldstein, a student at the Graduate School of Design and a member of the Committee on Common Spaces said that providing for performances has always been a major element of the committee’s plan. For the yard as a common space to be successful, he said, there needs to be more than just chairs, and the performers and food carts are an effort to make the space more attractive.
Faust’s initiative also aims to provide a common space that is more open to people outside Harvard, unlike the Harvard-centric Lamont Café and Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub.
Though one student said that the space is too open and criticized the fact that it attracts more than just the Harvard community, Lizabeth Cohen, a professor of American studies and head of the committee on common space said that “if people in the community want to sit down that is fine. We have open gates, we are not living behind bars.”
Although there were students in the crowd enjoying the playful the school.
Scott A. Sherman ’13 and two classmates who stopped to listen had not known of the event beforehand and were unsure what type of music the band was playing.
“I did not intentionally come out for this,” Sherman said. “The crowd caught my eye as I was walking back from Annenberg.”
As flocks of other freshmen walked by, few stopped to listen.
The two other freshman standing with Sherman noted that they were unsure where to learn about musical events in the yard. Though the performances are not heavily publicized, Cohen stressed that the they were not conceived to be large productions but rather to supplement the common space.
“The point [of the performances] is to have them out there, so when the weather is nice, people drop in,” she added.
Cohen emphasized that a primary purpose of the chairs in the Yard is to experiment and see how Harvard can improve social interactions with resources that are already available.
“We have learned that it doesn’t take a lot to make a difference,” Cohen said. “Putting out those chairs and tables in the Yard was not a major construction project but has changed the social environment on campus.”
While she said that the fall’s experiment has been a success, the committee’s next challenge is to see which new space can be used with the coming winter.
The chairs will be put away at the end of October, and new common space will be sought.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The smell of turkey was unmistakable. Students were piling up platefuls of mashed potatoes and cranberry stuffing, going for second and third servings of pumpkin pie. It was a classic Thanksgiving feast. In October.
To the outside observer, the gathering, held earlier this week in Annenberg and organized by the Harvard Canadian Club, might have seemed like a premature celebration of Turkey Day. But the celebrating students weren’t confused—they were Canadian.
For the past decade, Canadians have been the largest international contingent at Harvard, making up roughly 20 percent of the College’s international students.
Occasionally teased for their national obsession with hockey and sometimes mocked for the way they pronounce words like “out” and “about,” many of Harvard’s Canadians say their celebration of Thanksgiving reveals deeper cultural and political differences that exist between the neighboring countries.
A ‘MORE HONEST’ HOLIDAY?
Differences aside, more than just turkey connects the two holidays.
“When people ask what Canadian Thanksgiving is, I tell them it’s the same idea,” said Sisi Pan ’11 from Edmonton, Alberta. “Canadian Thanksgiving came first, actually.”
The first formal Thanksgiving ceremony in Canada was held by the explorer Martin Frobisher in 1578, 43 years before the celebrations by settlers in Plymouth, Mass. in 1621. Both holidays commemorate the end of the harvest season.
“We have it earlier since it’s colder back home,” Pan added.
The two Thanksgivings have historically been religious observances, though both are now regarded as secular.
Yet even if the holidays seem topically similar, the way in which they are viewed differs.
“I had no idea that Thanksgiving was such a huge holiday here,” said Professor of Chinese History Michael Szonyi, a Torontonian at the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. “In Canada, it’s just about eating... Our holidays are much more honest.”
Psychology Professor Steven Pinker agreed that Americans place more emphasis on Thanksgiving.
“When I was younger, it was a day off school,” said Pinker, a native of Montreal.
TURKEY AND POLITICS
The varying degree of emphasis placed on Thanksgiving reveals differences in larger issues of public discourse between Canada and America, according to a number of Canadian Harvard professors.
“Thanksgiving is a central part of the civic religion [in America]; a feast of almost political proportions, whereas Canadian Thanksgiving is a more modest family affair,” said European Studies Professor Peter A. Hall.
This view was echoed by many Canadians on campus.
“I sort of envy that people are so involved in politics here,” said Torontonian Yuying Luo ’12. “If you take a look at our politics, I can’t remember the last time we had anything big happen.”
“Back home, my friends and I never talk about politics,” said Alex H. Housser ’12, of Victoria, British Columbia.
But Americans have recently engaged more Canadians in their political conversation, considering the health care debate now raging in Congress.
“It’s assumed that I’m an expert on the topic,” said Professor Szonyi. “That by being Canadian, I have a political position.”
“With respect to policies like health care, Americans could learn a lot from the Canadian experience but they rarely know very much about it,” Professor Hall said.
LOOKING NORTH
The festivities earlier this week did not go unnoticed in the rest of Annenberg.
During dinner, about 30 students gathered behind a Canadian flag displayed over the balcony in Annenberg and sang the national anthem ‘O Canada’ in both English and French.
“Happy Canadian Thanksgiving!” they shouted to the curious patrons cheering below.
Polina Krass ’11, the prime minister of the Canadian Club, said she was really happy to continue the tradition of the Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. “I was really excited about the number of people who showed up,” she said.
As the Canadians chattered over the meal, patrons eating below looked on with an air of amusement and confusion.
Most people interviewed surmised that it was some sort of Canadian event, but only a handful were aware of the occasion or the nature of the holiday.
“I knew it was Canadian Thanksgiving because it was on my calendar,” said Nora S. Abo-Sido ’13. “Other than that, I don’t know much about it.”
Though not entirely representative of the whole Harvard community, this general unawareness does hint at an unfamiliarity with Canadian culture that Canadian students say they have encountered among Harvard undergrads.
“I actually had someone tell me that my English was really good in my freshman year,” Hayley Margio ’10 of Halifax, Nova Scotia recalled.
“I don’t think people are as curious about Canada as they are about other countries,” said Amy Wang ’12. “People assume that I can speak French; so when I started French A, they had that puzzled expression on their face.”
Most of the Canadians interviewed expressed that their experiences of being stereotyped have made them more self-conscious of their nationality.
“[Since I’ve come to Harvard,] I’ve cut down from saying ‘eh’ every other sentence to maybe twice an hour,” said Rylie X. Zhang ’13 of Toronto.
But these differences seem to render Harvard’s Canadian community more patriotic about their nation. “Being in a different culture forces you to think about what you believe in as a Canadian,” said Torontonian Peter S. Grbac ’12.
“I’m very proud of my country,” said Jonathan K. Tam ’10, another Torontonian. “It symbolizes home to me... the sense of belonging, the sense that I want to go back after I graduate.”

The office of the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth ruled yesterday against the Cambridge Chronicle’s appeal of a $1,215 fee to access more detailed information from the Cambridge Police Department.
The information in question—dispatch addresses and suspect descriptions—had been available free of charge on the department’s Web site as recently as this summer, according to Chronicle Editor David Harris.
“We are very disappointed and we still believe it is in the public interest for this information to be available,” Harris said. “We will do whatever we can to make sure that happens.”
The Cambridge Police Department did not return multiple requests for comment yesterday.
After noticing that dispatch addresses and suspect descriptions were no longer available online, the Chronicle put in a public records request on July 27 asking for more detailed information on police activity between July 1 and July 27.
The CPD told the Chronicle the information would cost $1,215 and the Chronicle subsequently filed a public records appeal to the Secretary of the Commonwealth on Aug. 13.
“The statutory requirements for the creation and release of a police log do not extend to the addresses to which the police respond,” wrote Supervisor of Records Alan Cote in his letter to Harris explaining his ruling against the appeal. The CPD’s legal advisor received a copy of the letter yesterday, though Harris said the Chronicle had not been informed of the decision when The Crimson called for comment.
Harris said the state took a “very strict approach to interpreting the public records law” in its ruling.
Providing the addresses of police dispatches would require reviewing, copying and re-filing over 500 reports, about 25 hours of work according to an e-mail CPD legal adviser Kelly A. Downes wrote to Harris on Aug. 10.
Given the work involved in the process, Cote wrote that $1,215 is a “reasonable fee estimate” for the department to comply with the request.
The CPD maintains a daily police log on its Web site that currently includes the names, ages, and addresses of people arrested by the Cambridge police and the street names—though not the specific addresses—of police dispatches.
While Downes has emphasized concern about “public safety” in the department’s policy, Harris pointed to a recent gang-related stabbing on Broadway as an example of the community’s need for more detailed information. The police log reported that the stabbing occurred on Broadway but did not provide a specific address.
“If residents are better informed they can make better decisions about their own public safety,” Harris said. “[It would make for] a healthier community and a safer community.”
Cambridge City Councillor Craig A. Kelley also expressed concern about the recent changes in the police log. On Oct. 5, he put forward a policy request seeking more information about how the department releases crime details. The department may have very good reasons for the change, he said, but they are not clear to the public yet.
The Harvard Crimson faced a similar legal battle with the Harvard police department over incident reports, when The Crimson argued that the department must provide the same information as public police forces because it is endowed with “special state powers.” In 2006, the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court ruled unanimously that the Harvard Police were not required to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Football is one of those sports where talent often runs in the family. Archie, Peyton, and Eli Manning, Howie and Chris Long, Kellen and Kellen Winslow—the list of NFL families is lengthy.
Harvard football is no exception to this trend, as the Crimson can say it has a player whose family heirloom is a football.
Hailing from Oxnard, California, freshman defensive back Brian Owusu is the second oldest in a family of five standout athletes.
He and his older brother, Chris, are both currently playing football for Division I schools.
The Owusu boys clearly get their athleticism from their father, Francis, who represented Ghana in the 400-meter race at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.
“He doesn’t like to talk about [the Olympics] much,” Brian said, “but we always tell him that we’re really proud of him for just being a great dad, and not being one of those dads who boasts about it and tells everybody.”
“Athletics runs in my family,” Francis said. “[When Brian and Chris were] in fourth [and fifth] grade, people were telling me how good they were in sports. I told them I would allow them to do sports only if they continued to do very well in school. If their grades fell, even one grade, I wouldn’t allow them to do sports anymore.”
Heeding their father’s advice, Brian and his older brother are both playing football for programs that stress academics.
Chris is a sophomore wide receiver and kick returner at Stanford and was one of only eight true freshmen to see playing time last year.
He made his mark by notching a 41-yard touchdown reception—Stanford’s second longest pass play of the 2008-2009 season—and he is currently second in the nation in kickoff return average.
Despite Chris’ tremendous success on the field, scholarship has always been stressed in the Owusu household.
Mr. and Mrs. Owusu taught their children that doing well in school is guaranteed to be valuable throughout life and that sports should always be secondary.
“Academics stays with you for the rest of your life,” Francis said. “Anything can happen in sports; you can get hurt. If you don’t have a good education, then what?”
After proving that he could keep his grades up, Brian pursued many different sports.
He has played baseball, soccer, basketball, track and field, and football. Brian was a three-sport athlete in high school, earning nine letters in football, basketball, and track.
He was a two-time team captain in football and track, and during his senior year he became the captain of the basketball team as well.
Inspired by his brother’s success in football, Brian looked for his own opportunity to stand out at the collegiate level.
“Growing up, I’ve been surrounded by great athletes in my family,” Brian said. “Seeing [Chris] at Stanford and how he’s doing extremely well, I’m proud of him. I’ve just come out here, trying to make a name for myself. I just try to work hard in practice [so] it shows in the games.”
Since arriving on campus, Brian has once again found the balance between academics and athletics and he acknowledges that he was able to transition to the unique environment of Ivy League football because of his father’s emphasis on school.
“My dad stressed education way before sports,” Brian said. “He’s one of those really influential people in my life. I look up to him.”
Soon members of the Crimson may begin looking up to Brian.
The rookie has already begun to make an impact with the football team, grabbing two first-half interceptions in Harvard’s victory over Cornell last Saturday.
“Brian is a very determined guy,” his mother, Eva, said. “He hates to lose at anything. He’s a fighter; he will do whatever it takes [to win].”
“The transition has gone pretty well,” Brian added. “It’s still a big jump [from high school to college]. I’m starting to get the hang of things, get the plays down, watching film, [and] talking to the coaches. It’s going pretty well right now.”
Playing with preseason All-American Derrick Barker, All-Ivy League safety Collin Zych, and reigning Ivy League Defensive Rookie of the Year Matt Hanson should help Brian continue to improve as he hopes to help the Crimson stay undefeated in Ivy play this season.
“Derrick Barker, Barnes, Zych, Matt Hanson, all of the upperclassmen [in the] secondary have just been outstanding,” Brian said. “They’ve just helped me out through all the practices, all the lifting, the film, [and] getting better. They’ve just been there for me like I was their brother. I really appreciate that.”
3,000 miles away from home and among such a cohesive group of players, Brian has found a new athletic family. And if his parents get their wish, it will only be part of the success he finds at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Taryn Kurcz still remembers her first day of preseason with the Harvard women’s soccer team.
The California-native, whose goal against Cornell last Saturday earned her the Ivy League Rookie of the Week, was nervous. When practice ended, Kurcz was unsure of how her performance stacked up on this new stage. But her fears were quickly dispelled.
“I remember [Katherine Sheeleigh] coming up to me and saying, ‘Taryn, you did a great job,’” Kurcz said.
Without a doubt, Sheeleigh’s performance on the field speaks for itself. The junior forward leads the Crimson with five goals, three of which came this past week in Harvard’s two victories over Fairfield and Cornell.
But it’s been her leadership development this season that her teammates have really noticed.
“When she plays with a certain intensity in these games she’s setting an example for some of the younger players,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said.
“If we’re having an off day she’s the one who steps up,” freshman Alexandra Conigliaro said. “She’s always raising the standards.”
On the field, Sheeleigh’s recent success could not have come at a more crucial time for the Crimson.
Entering the start of Ancient Eight play with a 1-5-1 non-conference record two weeks ago,
Harvard knew its hope of returning to the NCAA tournament for the second straight season rested on its performane in Ivy League play.
And since the Crimson opened its conference schedule on Sept. 26, the team has amassed a four-game winning streak and currently sits atop the Ivy League standings—largely thanks to the efforts of Sheeleigh.
“She’s extremely fast, she’s tough, [and] she has that mentality that a forward needs to be successful,” Nichols said.
In Harvard’s two victories over Fairfield and Cornell this past week, the junior standout led the Crimson offensively, taking 12 shots and scoring three goals, including the game-winner in the Fairfield match.
“She has a very competitive spirit and attitude when it comes to games and I think the nature of the Ivy League pulls that out of anyone,” Nichols said.
The first of Sheeleigh’s two goals against Fairfield came just over two minutes into the game.
The two-time First Team All-Ivy selection received a pass from junior midfielder Kerry Kartsonis, who is also a Crimson sports editor, inside the box.
From 10 yards out, Sheeleigh took the shot at goal, which was dropped by Stags goalie Kelly Boudreau inside the net.
After Fairfield evened the score at 1-1, the New Jersey-native gave Harvard the lead yet again in the 43rd minute.
This time, sophomore forward Patricia Yau set up Sheeleigh, who blasted the ball through the Stags defense from 15 yards out, putting her team ahead for good.
After that victory, Harvard met Cornell in its second Ivy League matchup of the season.
Sheeleigh tried to get things going for the Crimson offense in the first half, leading her team with three shots.
But at the break, the score remained knotted at 0-0.
“[At halftime] we were satisfied that we had been getting good chances and we knew the goals would follow,” Sheeleigh said.
And Sheeleigh helped ensure that the scoreboard would not remain blank.
Harvard struck first in the 53rd minute off a goal from Kurcz.
And it didn’t take long for Sheeleigh to get in on the action, as she added her own score in the 56th minute.
The 2007 Ivy League Rookie of the Year received the ball out of the air and found Conigliaro, who quickly returned it with a through ball that Sheeleigh finished.
“It was just kind of one of those perfect goals,” Nichols said.
The Crimson offense has stepped up in recent matches, scoring eleven goals in its past four games after being held to just six in the team’s first seven contests.
“I think offensively we are really starting to click,” said Sheeleigh, who, with five goals already this season, has nearly surpassed the six goals she scored as a sophomore in 2008.
“We have phenomenal forwards and midfielders,” Nichols said. “Sheeleigh does a great job of leading that attack.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today marks the start of a pivotal few days for the Harvard men’s soccer team. After a dominant 6-0 start to the season, the Crimson squad has had a reality check following a loss to No. 3 Wake Forest on September 26 and 1-1 draw with unranked Cornell this past Saturday. This afternoon, the Crimson faces a tough matchup against the University of Connecticut (6-2-4), before hosting No. 19 Brown (6-0-4, 2-0 Ivy) on Saturday.
“After a very strong start to the season, we’ve hit a few speed bumps,” co-captain Brian Grimm said. “This week gives us the chance to get going in the right direction.”
“We’ve had a couple games where we’ve played very well, but have just not managed to score,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “We’re creating chances and doing all the right things now, but we’re just not scoring the goals we were able to earlier in the season.”
This week will offer the Crimson an opportunity to revamp its performance. But it will be no easy feat with the high level of play expected from its two opponents.
“Our two games this week will probably be the most difficult of the year,” Clark explained.  “The University of Connecticut has played its last five games without giving up a goal, and has just really found its form.”
Brown has been equally impressive of late, starting the conference season 2-0. Sophomore forward Sean Rosa was recently named Ivy League Player of the Week after its victory against Princeton.
But the Harvard players are not intimidated.
“We’re all really excited to get back on the field and play against some of the top programs in the country,” freshman Brian Rogers said.
First up for the Crimson is a trip to the University of Connecticut tonight.
“The University of Connecticut is probably the most fun place to play in the country,” Grimm said. “They have a great fan base and are always very competitive.”
“It’s always a great atmosphere to play in,” Clark agreed. “The University of Connecticut will have 4,000 fans, a sell-out crowd, so it’s very rare for them to lose a game at home.”
The Huskies, who currently sit atop the Big East division, have recently defeated big names such as Syracuse and Georgetown, and will look to extend their five-game unbeaten streak with a victory over Harvard.
The match will likely be a battle of defenses. Harvard’s back line, headed by sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms, has allowed only four goals in ten games. Meanwhile, the University of Connecticut’s defense has had nine shutouts on the season.
Although the Crimson looks to bolster its confidence with a victory in Connecticut, the game versus Brown is all about rivalry, bitter and tested by time.
“Over the last decade, Brown has become one of, if not the best team in the Ivy league and probably our biggest rival,” Clark said. “In the last few years, neither of us has been able to win at home. After our 4-1 victory last year, Brown will be looking to reverse the trend.”
“Brown is definitely our arch rival,” Rogers said. “It will be a really tough match, but it’s our alumni weekend so there’s a crowd returning for the game.”
On the heels of the tie with Cornell, a win against the Bears is also vital for the conference standings.
“We can’t afford another slip up like we had against Cornell,” Rogers said. “We got away with that draw, but we need a win [against Brown].”
Overall, the week is ripe with opportunity.
“There are all the makings here for two very good games,” Grimm said. “This week is a great chance to get the second half of the season going, to build confidence and momentum again.”
Harvard knows that it cannot afford to waste that chance.
“In the last few games we expected to do better than we did, and caught ourselves playing down to the level of our competition,” Rogers said. “Everyone’s ready to turn that around.”

Some very widely-circulated statistics say that the average Harvard student will have 2.5 sexual partners in their time here on campus. Apparently, that number quadruples if you are a member of Expressions Dance Company. Well...at least the number of people you dry hump goes up.
As a promotional tool for their upcoming Halloween concert "Experiment," the hip-hop dance group released two videos on YouTube featuring some, how shall we put it...freaky ass scenes. The premise? "What Starts Clean...Must Turn Dirty." Curious yet? See for yourselves after the jump.
Harvard students expressing some sexual frustration. (Update: as of 1:30 a.m., the video has been made private on YouTube.)
Apparently, getting dirty at Harvard starts first with a man making serial killer eyes at a room full of scantily clad women freaking in some poor student's common room (0:30). It also means freaking in the shower (0:34). Or freaking in bed while a fellow student enjoys the show (0:40). Or maybe moving your roommate's shit from the closet into the hall so you can use the closet for some more private freaking (0:47). Better yet? Freaking on a futon while pretending you're Akon (0:50). Or getting back at the Building Manager by freaking his lamp (0:52)-- and no, not that lamp. Having a fully clothed orgy (1:02)! And of course, as these kinds of nights must end, making out with the toilet (1:04). Maybe downing that handle (0:54) wasn't such a good call.
Anyone down to get dirty tonight?
And if that wasn't enough, this one is just awkward.

That infamous chore of waking up unreasonably early to plaster flyers around campus may soon end its reign of terror in the Yard. That is, if Souvik Paul '11 gets his way.
Paul said that he is launching a campaign to reduce postering in the Yard as part of a project for his junior Social Studies tutorial. He is currently still in the process of organizing leaders to help jumpstart the movement. Interested in this potential paper-less revolution? Read on, after the jump.
Although sustainability and paper reduction may seem like the most obvious driving forces behind the project, Paul also contends that postering is simply not effective. In an e-mail to Harvard Resource Efficiency Program leaders, he wrote:
 
Paul says he hopes to solve the problem by devising reasonable alternative advertising methods and presenting them to student groups. That way, "instead of saying postering is bad, and you should stop, we'll say 'you can do x, y, and z and that will get you decent attendance at your event,'" he said in an interview.
Watch for e-mails about the campaign to learn more about alternatives to pre-dawn postering.
