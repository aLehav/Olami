After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As The Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ annual spring show “Mean Ghouls” enters its final week of performances, The Harvard Crimson sat down with playwrights Jessica M. Moore ’21 and Jakob L. Gilbert ’21 to learn more about the process of creating the show.
The Harvard Crimson: How did each of you first get involved in comedy at home and at Harvard?
Jessica M. Moore: I was not into comedy when I first started here. I was a pre-med, very strict, “A type” personality and I fell into the Pudding by chance through comping the tech crew — and so I’ve been on the tech crew with the Pudding for the past two years.
Jakob L. Gilbert: I didn’t know I was into comedy back home, I don’t think. But looking back on it I think I was, in a way where I didn’t realize it. And then I came here and I studied Computer Science for, like, a year-and-a-half. I auditioned for some improv troupes. I wasn’t involved in the Pudding until Jess and I started writing the show. But yeah, [it was] mostly improv and I started writing for [a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization which used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine] as well.
THC: What does the process of writing, producing, and staging [the annual show] look like from start to finish?
JMM: We start with the script, lyric, and composer competitions that begin the end of May, and those run through July. In our case, we wrote a show and, once we won, they very politely asked us to start over.
JLG: The show that we wrote for the script comp — which we’re very proud of, it’s a very silly show — was unfortunately nixed because the setting was too similar to HPT 170. The show was called “Gone With The Gin,” and it took place in prohibition era Chicago.
[Editor’s note: “Gone With The Gin” starred a half-human, half-gin monster called the “Gin-otaur.”]
THC: How did you come up with “Mean Ghouls”?
JLG: It’s fascinating because I think the vast majority of Pudding shows are built based on historical events. We had to do a lot of world-building because it’s completely fantasy, which was so, so fun. How did we come up with it? We sort of took a bunch of high school movies and Transylvania tropes and mashed them together. And we went through so many revisions, like at least eight different full plots, which was really, really crazy.
JMM: I think one thing that the Pudding is built upon is archetypes. The idea is that the characters, you know them the instant you see them on stage. It’s not crazy inventive. The plots feel like plots that you’ve seen before. It’s just finding a combination of common motifs. One thing we always joked about is we had to use a very common Disney movie plot and figure out a way to incorporate that into a show that feels fresh and new and also has depth.
JLG: It’s a really weird writing experience because sometimes Jess would, like, watch a Disney movie and then call me up and be like, “I just had the best idea for the show, because I watched ‘The Little Mermaid.’”
THC: The Hasty Pudding Theatricals recently began accepting female performers. Did that change the dynamic of writing the show? Was that something you kept in mind as you were creating these characters?
JMM: I think something that’s interesting that happened this year that usually doesn’t happen is that usually, in Pudding history, they say we need six male-presenting characters and six female-presenting characters and half of those will be gender-bent. This year there wasn’t a ton of pressure on us to hit that exactly, it was more just like whatever feels most correct for the show. In the casting room we didn’t come in saying “these are the three characters that are going to be played by men and these are the three that are gonna be played by women.” It really just felt like a free space for us to see who really played characters well regardless of gender. There were so many characters where we thought, “this character will be played best by someone of this gender” and we were really surprised, actually. We ended up with the first female majority show in the Pudding’s history. All the opencast spots were taken by women this year.
JLG: I think, in a really positive way, a lot of these traditions have been broken down. We came in this year, and we had heard from so many past writers that it’s difficult to work with the professional adults that we ended up working with, and they were such a pleasure this whole year. We came in and the first thing we heard from them was: This year is different, do what you want with this show.
Pretty much every Pudding show has this love duet in the beginning, and it’s very clear that whichever two characters sing this love duet are going to fall in love by the end. That is the end of the show. We start the show with an unrequited love duet between the main character and someone who is just a huge asshole. And he totally doesn’t see that she’s in love with him, doesn’t care. And then she is in love with him for the whole show — I won’t spoil the end of the show — but, ultimately, does not end up with him, even though, I think, a lot of the alums who came to see the show were positive she would because it’s just 170 years of that.
We also are really proud to have removed certain jokes. There’s a certain number of annual jokes you have to make. We trash Yale for a second. We talk about tenured Harvard professors. There’s this one joke — I never understood the point of it.
JMM: Historically, it came from joking about Radcliffe women and then, as that transition happened [Harvard accepting women], it was joking about Wellesley girls.
JLG: We just cut it. It’s done.
JMM: I remember we thought: What is the point of this joke? Where is the humor coming from? This is just a sexist joke that’s a remnant of what this company used to be. Getting rid of that felt really powerful.
And I think the one thing that I’m super proud of that we’ve done is, I think most Pudding shows are big farces and there isn’t really a moral that’s happening in the show. But I feel like we worked really hard to make this show have something that people can take away from it, and that feels really different and new and exciting.
JLG: It was also just really important to us that we had a strong, female character lead played by a female actress. Ellie Shaheen just took that and killed it.
THC: And you [Jessica] are the first woman to write a Hasty Pudding show in what is it? A decade?
JMM: This is the ten-year anniversary! I don’t think I fully understood why that might’ve been the case when I first started writing, but I remember going through the comp and thinking even the relationship that Jake and I have to comedy is a little bit different. I’m definitely much more unsure of myself and need a bit more validation in my jokes and in my writing. I think that’s just an example of how the comedy world is this male-driven space and how uncomfortable it is to be a woman. To be a female comedian is really hard because there are things that you want to joke about that are really funny to you and, you think, to other women, but when you’re pitching that in a space that’s full of men and it doesn’t land then you’re set back a little bit. Even though it’s a great feminine joke.
I think it’s something that needs to change and I think that women need to know that they are funny and there are people that want to laugh at their jokes and there’s space for them in the comedy world. I don’t think anything was uniquely different about me writing the show and being a woman. There were definitely moments where I looked around our production meeting rooms and saw that it was just a handful of women compared to the number of men, but that’s also changing. We’re getting some female professionals into the company. Next year, especially, I hope women are running the show. Not to knock Jake down, but...
JLG: That’s okay. I hope so, too.
THC: What have you learned from this experience? What are you proudest of in this show? What are you excited for people to see?
JMM: It’s hard to encapsulate the experience in one takeaway. I will say it’s been the most intense writing experience I’ve ever had. It definitely makes me feel like a writer. I came into this seeing myself as a person who writes, and now I see myself as a writer. It taught me a lot about how to work with one person for so long on a project, and how to talk about your opinion and argue for things that you believe in and know what hill to die on.
JGL: That’s such a good point. My theory on comedy, I would hope both of ours, has changed so much. I really don’t know if I ever would have thought, before this process, that it was productive to explain why something is funny. And yet, by the end of it, Jess and I both became so proficient at succinctly saying why something is funny.
JMM: We’ve come a very long way in our writing.
JGL: Jess and I have had such a crazy arc as friends and writers together. It’s been one of the most beautiful relationships I’ve ever had, personally, where we fought and we distanced ourselves from each other and we came back together and just had this crazy, beautifully written but improvised arc between the two of us. It’s been really great. And now we’re best friends.
JMM: And now we’re best friends! I really want to encourage other young women to try to write the show and see it as an opportunity to just explore a new interest. You don’t have to be a writer who’s written a million things. You don’t have to know the Pudding formula. You can just walk into the comp room and start there.

It’s difficult to pin down The Weeknd’s latest single, “After Hours.” Maybe it’s the song’s length — clocking in at just over six minutes — or maybe the song’s three distinct movements. The first two minutes harken back to his older discography; then he shifts into a rhythm people might actually be able to dance to, before finally ending on a somber, almost haunting note. But while the lyrics leave a bit to be desired and the song is slow to ramp up, “After Hours” is still worth a listen.
The single’s weakest point is certainly its lyrics. The chorus is a far cry from poetry as the Weeknd croons, “Oh baby, / Where are you now that I need you most? / I’d give it all just to hold you close.” Other lyrics oscillate between the cliché, “this house is not a home,” to the cringe-worthy, “I wanna share babies / Protection, we won’t need it.” And, quite honestly, it’s difficult to hear most of the lyrics in the first verse due to The Weeknd’s breathy falsetto.
But perhaps the breather singing is for the best, considering the song’s best parts are when The Weeknd’s voice and the beat converge to something just right. Once the song reaches its pinnacle, sometime between the second verse and the chorus, it becomes the kind of music that is the perfect backdrop to a late night drive down the highway. The music and the sound of his voice show more than the lyrics themselves: When he sings, “Sorry that I broke your heart,” you’re ready to forgive even though he sounds likely to break it again.
While the song is reminiscent of The Weeknd’s 2012 album, “Trilogy” — think “Wicked Games” and “High for This” — the lyrics have nowhere near the same amount of emotional resonance. While his falsetto at times works magic with the interesting beats of “After Hours,” after a while it seems that the song would benefit from more of the Weeknd’s regular voice. “After Hours” is the kind of song to play in the background of everyday life, but for those searching for something deeper, look elsewhere.

Following a thrilling premiere, episode two of the final season of “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” continues the story of Clone Force 99 and Captain Rex (all voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) with the addition of Jedi Knight and Republic General Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter). “A Distant Echo” delves into the intertwined lives of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala (Catherine Taber), continuing to show off more of the “Star Wars” galaxy, and further establishing the dangers of the Galactic Clone War. Despite presenting two significant continuity issues within the context of the “Star Wars” franchise, the second episode of Season Seven is incredible content nonetheless.
In the beginning of “A Distant Echo,” Skywalker walks out of the barracks after a touching conversation with Amidala, encountering Obi Wan Kenobi (James Arnold Taylor) along the way. “I hope you at least told Padmé I said hello,” Kenobi casually comments, as “Across the Stars” — Anakin and Padmé’s love theme from “Attack of the Clones” — gently plays in the background. The Jedi Code states "there is no emotion, there is peace," a warning against worldly attachment and strong emotional connections. A seemingly inconsequential comment from a close friend, then, becomes much more significant because of the implication that Kenobi is allowing this kind of attachment within the Jedi Order. By doing this, “A Distant Echo” seemingly rewrites canon, hinting at Kenobi’s role in Skywalker’s impending fall to the dark side as Darth Vader during “Revenge of the Sith.” This is one of many examples of “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” bolstering the stories from the prequels through careful and witty writing — something the prequels themselves often failed to do.
As the episode progresses, the Clones and Skywalker visit the never-before-seen world of Skako Minor. With few prior canon references, the world was largely open to interpretation. Directors Steward Lee and Dave Filoni depict savage dust storms, an aggressive climate, and a unique cultural dichotomy. The pacifistic Poletec people wrangle with the war continually altering their way of life while the militaristic Skakoans, led by recurring villains Wat Tambor and the Techno Union, are war mongers. The "Star Wars" universe has a seemingly limitless capacity for world-building, and Lee and Filoni’s portrayal of Skako makes full use of it.
However, not everything in this episode of “The Clone Wars” adheres perfectly to established “Star Wars” canon. In Skywalker and Amidala’s conversation, the Outer Rim Sieges are stated as a reason for Skywalker’s constant absence. Seemingly, this wouldn’t be an issue as the Outer Rim is a massive swath of space and is the location of much of “The Clone Wars,” but the issue arises knowing Anaxes is a part of the Deep Core — not the Outer Rim. According to canon, the planet was central to Coruscant’s protection and the formation of the Galactic Republic. However, because of Skywalker’s comment, it seems as if the entire history of the planet is up to speculation. Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm, it seems, wasn’t as smooth as it was made out to be.
Another issue arises when we learn that the ARC Trooper Echo somehow managed to survive a terrible explosion and was taken captive by the CIS and the Techno Union to be used as an intelligence during the heat of the war. Unlike the more traditional carbonite freezing — which preserves life for extended periods of time — that is seen in “The Empire Strikes Back,” Echo is kept alive through unknown advanced cybernetics and mind controlled by Wat Tambor. Although it’s not unusual for the “Star Wars” universe to introduce new technology, the issue lies in the convenience of such a tool. Surely this ability — were it to exist — would have been used across the galaxy, yet it appears nowhere else in the “Star Wars” canon. This casual plot point draws into question the integrity and legitimacy of the new writers of “The Clone Wars.” A shame, considering how captivating the season has been so far.

Zack Villere is a musician from Covington, Louisiana known for his humorous social media presence and distinctive, eclectic music. While on the road for his “Trevor Rice Is Not Going On Tour” tour, Villere sat down with The Harvard Crimson to talk about his creative process, musical aspirations, and unique sense of humor.
This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity. 
The Harvard Crimson: How are you feeling? What was for breakfast?
Zack Villere: Today I had a turkey bacon egg and cheese. That’s all I’ve had. I’m gonna eat some food after this.
THC: From a one to 10?
ZV: I would say probably five. The turkey bacon wasn’t really crispy. But it was good. I like turkey bacon, personally.
THC: Is this your first time playing in Boston?
ZV: This is my first time being here. Ever.
THC: How do you like it so far?
ZV: Seems dope. I haven’t seen much but we drove past the river. It seems dope. Where I’m from, the river is like really fucking gross. It’s like a dark, dark brown river. It’s really polluted. I don’t know, I like it.
THC: In what ways, if any, has your hometown shaped who you are or shaped your sound? Have you drawn any inspiration from it?
ZV: I would say a bunch. I love my home a lot. So I would just assume it’s influenced me a lot… I have this song on the album called “Rope Swing,” it's about a rope swing back home.
THC: With this being your first time in Boston, both long-time fans and strangers alike will finally be able to see you perform live for the first time. In general, what do you hope for people to receive from attending one of your shows?
ZV: I'm just trying to have fun. I'm not that interested in performing that much, in general, so I just want to have fun with it. I don’t feel like I am expressing myself that much live. I mean, I'm doing shit but, like I said, just trying to have fun and get through it and enjoy it as much as I can because it is really not my interest. I don’t see it [as] part of my art, really.
THC: You named your tour “Trevor Rice Is Not Going On Tour." Where does that name come from?
ZV: Yes sir, he’s not here. That’s my dude. Yeah, he’s a mogul. He’s a billionaire. He’s a good friend of ours, so shout-out to Trevor Rice. Yo, put his @, his @ is soggynewport. Like the cigarettes Newport. Please put that in there, thank you. Shout him out. Shout Trevor out.

THC: You also recently released an album titled “Cardboard City” on Valentine’s Day. What were your intentions with the release date and this new project?
ZV: The release date was an accident, it just came from the album being delayed a lot. I was really eager to have it out because it’s been done for a while. There was just a lot of shit that held it up. So I was just like fuck, I want this out. There was really no reason for the date, it just happened. I didn’t even know it was coming out on Valentine’s Day until like a few weeks before.
THC: Okay, random question. If you were in a fight with a stranger, would you rather have them scream or whisper at you?
ZV: Probably scream, I feel like I wouldn’t even hear them whispering. If it was a loud whisper it’d be kind of funny. I guess it’d be kind of creepy. I can’t really imagine what that would be like. I honestly can’t give you a verdict. I would just say scream. Nah, I’d say whisper because it’s funny.
THC: What are the most and least sexy names you can think of right now?
ZV: Fucking Christmas, sexy. And non-sexy, Cobra.
THC: I was thinking more like Keith or something.
ZV: Keith? That’s my dad’s name.
THC: Yeah, well there you go.
ZV: I wouldn’t say that’s sexy or non-sexy, that’s just my dad. Do you think Keith is not sexy?
THC: You’ve been at this for a really long time, and there are articles that state that you are comfortable with being in this middle earth between hardly known and super-star. Can you elaborate more on that?
ZV: So, actually that shit kind of pissed me off. It just annoyed me. I don’t think he meant anything by it, but I kind of came across as ambitious-less. I don’t know if that’s a word. But I am. I was just like, no, it's cool that a lot of people can make money and be a middle class of artist through streaming. It’s really sick, but that doesn’t mean that’s where I want to stay forever. I'm trying to scale my art. I don’t want to just stay at the same level, but I think it’s cool that people can do that. And I’m grateful to be able to do it, so that’s how I feel about that. I still have more ambition, but yeah, that shit irritated me.

UPDATED: March 11, 11:30 a.m.
Anthony T. Carvello, a Harvard University police officer who came under scrutiny last month for his use of force in an arrest at the Smith Campus Center, has also received criticism for his use of force in two other recent arrests of homeless black men at the Smith Center.
Carvello, 61, put his hand on one man’s neck during a September arrest, according to video footage. The man said he could not breathe as a result.
Four months later, Carvello wrote in a police report that he pepper-sprayed another man during a January arrest. The man said in both a conversation with a HUPD sergeant after the arrest and an interview with The Crimson that Carvello, who is white, called him a “n----r.”
Just two weeks ago, witnesses criticized Carvello for pushing a man to the floor while arresting him for trespassing in the Smith Center. In its most recent meeting, Harvard’s student government condemned Carvello’s actions.
Witnesses to the September arrest and the February arrest said they believe Carvello used excessive force. Two said they expressed their concerns directly to the department.
Four HUPD officers familiar with the arrests, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the department, said they believe Carvello used excessive force in one or more of the arrests.
The four HUPD officers also said they believe the department should have removed Carvello from his post in the Smith Center pending investigation.
Catalano wrote in his emailed statement that the department reviewed all three incidents and found that Carvello did not violate HUPD’s guidelines.
“For all three arrests in question there were supervisory reviews of the use of force. In all three incidents the supervisor found that the force was reasonable and within HUPD’s Policies and Guidelines,” Catalano wrote.
Prior to these incidents, Carvello had issued all three men trespass warnings for the Smith Center. In all three cases, HUPD charged the arrestees with violating their trespass warnings and resisting arrest.
“The Department does not comment on details about individual circumstances,” Catalano wrote. “The most common categories of conduct which lead to issuance of a trespass warning are: violation of building use rules (e.g. sleeping, noise), theft, vandalism, intoxication, disruption, and violent or threatening behavior.”
All three men — who are 20, 21, and 22 years old — are defendants in ongoing criminal cases at Cambridge District Court or Cambridge District Homeless Court that resulted from the charges.
When he began working at the Smith Center, Carvello was assigned to patrol one of Harvard’s most public spaces. According to its website, the Smith Center “fosters a welcoming and vibrant entrance to Harvard University” for University affiliates, visitors, and Cambridge residents alike. The building sits in the center of Harvard Square.
In addition to his patrol position, Carvello is also one of the department’s defensive tactics instructors, a position in which he teaches HUPD officers best practices for de-escalating situations.
On Sept. 29, 2019 at around 9:30 a.m., Carvello approached Terry T. Jackson, 20, to whom he had previously issued a trespass warning, on the second level of the Campus Center, according to a publicly available incident report.
Carvello wrote in the report that he informed Jackson that he was violating his trespass warning and that Jackson used expletives to describe him while Carvello waited for backup.
Carvello wrote that he pushed Jackson’s head down after he allegedly refused Carvello’s order to place his hands behind his back for an arrest, according to the incident report.
“He refused and grabbed onto one of the several beams lined up inside of the windows,” Carvello wrote. “In an attempt to disengage Mr. Jackson from the beam, I attempted to place him off balance by pushing his head down to the left with my right hand; results were negative.”
According to video footage capturing part of the incident, Carvello put his hand on Jackson’s neck before putting him in handcuffs. Three other officers also arrived on scene to help assist Carvello.
Jackson said in an interview with The Crimson that he could not breathe when Carvello grabbed his neck and said he had an anxiety attack during the arrest.
“It’s just that the officer was pressing his arm against my neck. My neck was hurting. It was through the back of my throat all the way down my spine where my tailbone is. And he literally pushed me against the window, took my arm, he put it all the way up behind my back,” he said.
Aryana S. Watkins, 22, Jackson’s girlfriend, said in an interview with The Crimson that she saw Jackson crying as he was placed in the back of an HUPD car.
Isabel M. Levin ’22 and Quinn T. Lewis ’22, who witnessed the arrest, said in interviews they believe Carvello used excessive force while arresting Jackson. Levin said she called the department’s station later that day and expressed concerns regarding Carvello’s use of force.
Three HUPD officers familiar with the arrest said it was inappropriate that Carvello put his hands on Jackson’s neck and that the department should have removed him from the Smith Center pending investigation.
“The officer arresting Jackson did place his hands on Jackson’s head in an effort to get him to disengage from the column he grabbed onto while resisting arrest,” Catalano wrote.
Four months after the arrest, the department selected Carvello to be one of the department’s two patrol officers of the Smith Center. Officers in this post have flexible weekday schedules.
“The central and open nature of the SCC’s public spaces lends itself to increased activity,
including behaviors that do not abide by the rules of the space,” Catalano wrote. “Our officers assigned to the SCC are required to respond to more issues than they might otherwise in another part of campus.”
On Jan. 28 at approximately 11:22 a.m., Carvello was dispatched to the Smith Center to respond to a report of an “unwanted guest” on the second floor according to a publicly available incident report Carvello wrote.
As Carvello climbed the steps to the second level, he saw Isaiah L. Scott, 22, to whom he had given a trespass warning the previous day.
Carvello wrote in his report that as he approached Scott, Scott walked away from him toward the Wellness Center on the second floor of the Smith Center. Carvello wrote that, because Scott had allegedly been “non-compliant” in their interaction the day before, Carvello drew his pepper spray as he pursued Scott “in the event Mr. Scott became non-compliant.”
Carvello approached Scott near the elevators and told him he was under arrest for trespassing, according to the report. He then ordered Scott to put his hands behind his back.
Carvello wrote that Scott refused his orders and repeatedly asked to speak to Carvello’s supervisor. Carvello added that he threatened to pepper-spray Scott.
“He stated; ‘No!! get me your Supervisor!’ I stated; ‘Don’t make me spray you!’. I told him again to turn around and put his hands behind his back; to which he replied again; ‘No!! get me your Supervisor!” Carvello wrote.
Carvello wrote that he pepper-sprayed in Scott’s direction. Scott dodged the spray and attempted to run away from Carvello. Carvello then followed Scott, repeatedly demanded that he put his hands behind his back, and sprayed him two more times, making contact with Scott’s face.
“I followed him and repeated commands to stop and put his hands behind his back,” Carvello wrote. “I sprayed two more times hitting him once on the side of his face and once directly in his eyes. I secure[d] him against the wall and waited for backup to arrive.”
Six HUPD officers arrived at the scene to assist Carvello with handcuffing Scott, according to Carvello’s report. As the group of officers attempted to pin Scott to the wall, Carvello wrote, Scott’s resistance allegedly intensified, prompting Carvello to tell the officers to move Scott to the ground.
“It was at that time that I yelled to the group to put him on the floor. Mr. Scott was forced to the floor where handcuffing was completed,” Carvello wrote.
Scott said in a Monday interview with The Crimson that he attempted to leave the Smith Center after he first saw Carvello. He said when Carvello approached him, Carvello called him a “n----r.”
Scott said Carvello pepper-sprayed him without any warning, and that other HUPD officers arrived and slammed him to the floor. He said he sustained a rug burn to his cheek that was exacerbated by his skin’s exposure to the pepper-spray.
Roughly a week after the arrest, Scott said he went to HUPD headquarters to retrieve his belongings and told two HUPD employees Carvello harassed him and used excessive force during his arrest. Scott said the employees told him they would look into his allegations. He also said they never followed up with him.
Scott said he believes Carvello used force while arresting him because he is black.
“I never thought I'd be a victim of police brutality. The way I carry myself even though I'm homeless, I still look decent,” he said. “I try to articulate myself the best way I can. I try to present myself professionally.”
Scott also said he has sought counseling because of the incident with Harvard’s police.
Catalano wrote that the department is conducting an investigation into the arrest and that it is HUPD policy not to comment on ongoing investigations.
HUPD Sergeant James P. Pignone, 53, arrived at the scene of Scott’s arrest at approximately 11:30 a.m. He wrote in a report that Scott was “very agitated” while they waited for an ambulance and that Scott told him he wanted to file a complaint against Carvello.
“Scott said that he was being harassed by Officer Carvello,” Pignone wrote. “That he (Scott) had done nothing wrong, that he wasn’t trespassing and that Officer Carvello had just walked up to him, called him a n----r and sprayed him with pepper spray.”
Catalano wrote in his statement that the department allows officers to use pepper spray and force in certain situations.
“By Department policy officers are allowed to use Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray,” Catalano wrote. “HUPD officers are instructed to use only the amount of force that is reasonably necessary to deescalate the incident and bring it under control. If de-escalation does not work, officers may apply an escalating level of force to meet the level of resistance.”
Pignone wrote in another report that he assessed the arrest, finding that Carvello’s use of force was appropriate.
“I conclude that Off. Carvello’s use of force, in attempt to gain control of Scott and stop him from his aggressive and non compliant behavior, was within HUPD’s policies and guidelines,” he wrote.
Three officers in the department familiar with the situation disagree with Pignone’s assessment. They told The Crimson they believe Carvello used excessive force while arresting Scott.
On Feb. 20 at approximately 11 a.m., Carvello approached Tyrique D. Simmons, 21, who had an active trespass warning for all Harvard University property, on the first floor of the Smith Center, according to two internal HUPD incident reports written by Carvello.
Carvello wrote that he approached Simmons, who was walking from the Smith Center’s common area toward its main hallway.
As Simmons attempted to leave, Carvello “put [his] hands on [Simmons’s] chest and shoulder area and guided him toward the wall,” according to the first report.
The two men grappled near a column across from the elevators, according to the police reports. Simmons then made an attempt to run away and Carvello grabbed Simmons and backed him into the column, where Carvello told him he was under arrest.
Carvello wrote in the first internal report that Simmons’s resistance intensified after Carvello told Simmons he was under arrest. Specifically, he wrote that he “could feel his body tighten and lean forcefully toward mine.”
Carvello wrote in both reports that he punched Simmons to preempt an assault.
“I struck Mr. Simmons with a short strike to the left side of his face with my right fist,” he wrote in the second report.
Simmons said in an interview with The Crimson that he was attempting to leave the Smith Center when Carvello stopped him. He added that Carvello grabbed him and punched him in the face.
During the incident, Simmons told Carvello, “I didn’t do anything,” according to Carvello’s reports and video footage.
On the day of the arrest, three witnesses said they believed Carvello used excessive force when arresting Simmons. One witness said she filed a complaint with HUPD the same day.
Simmons told The Crimson he feared for his life during the arrest and that he has since experienced heightened stress. His mother, Tanya L. Simmons, 42, said her son has avoided physical contact in the weeks since the arrest.
Several hours after the arrest, Carvello submitted a report detailing the incident to an internal HUPD database.
According to an officer in the department, the report was updated the following day with new details that were not included in the previous report.
“Every incident report written is reviewed by a supervisor as well [as] other department personnel as part of a quality control process,” Catalano wrote. “When an error or additional information that should have been added is identified, officers will update either their initial report or add a supplemental narrative to [the] initial report.”
Carvello wrote in the first report that he struck Simmons on the left side of his face.
“Mr. Simmons[’s] resistance appeared to increase after I told him that he was under arrest,” the section of the first report describing Carvello’s use of force reads. “I held him against the column by placing both of my hands on his chest and shoulder area. While holding him, I could feel his body tighten and lean forcefully toward mine. Feeling that an assault was imminent, I struck Mr. Simmons [on] the left side of his face with my right fist.”
Carvello’s second report includes a more detailed account of both Simmons’s behavior and the incident more broadly.
“Mr. Simmons resisted my attempts to get control of him by repositioning his feet, striking my hands away in an aggressive manner, swing[ing] his hips from side to side and mov[ing his] hands up and down, as I attempted to take hold of at least one of them,” Carvello wrote. “Finally, I was able to get hold of Mr. Simmons’ body. It was at this moment that I felt his body get tight and begin to push toward me. These pre-assault cues [led] me to think that I was about to be tackled or pushed to the ground. Sensing that an assault was imminent, I struck Mr. Simmons with a short strike to the left side of his face with my right fist.”
In the first report, Carvello wrote that he forced Simmons to the floor before other officers arrived at the scene.
“The strike both distracted and stopped Mr. Simmons’ advance. It also provided me with the opportunity to force him to the floor. Mr. Simmons tucked his hands under his body” as two other officers arrived, according to Carvello’s first report.
In the second report, Carvello added that he drew his pepper spray while Simmons was on the floor.
“At this point I ordered Mr. Simmons to put his hand behind his back, he refused,” Carvello wrote in the second report. “I drew my department issued OC spray and once again ordered Mr. Simmons to place his hands behind his back to which he refused. I yelled in a loud voice, ‘Don’t make me spray you’. I thought about the cross contamination to the many visitors to the SCC if I were to spray Mr. Simmons. I secured my OC and continued to control him on the floor.”
While Carvello stood over Simmons, he repeatedly threatened to use his pepper spray, according to a partial video of the arrest. Two HUPD officers arrived on scene and helped handcuff Simmons, according to both versions of the report.
Three HUPD officers familiar with the situation said they believe Carvello used excessive force with Simmons.
Former Boston Police Department lieutenant and current Emmanuel College sociology professor Thomas Nolan called the number of allegations raised against Carvello over the past several months unusual.
“You've got three instances of excessive force allegations in six months,” he said. “That's a lot. That's more than most police officers will accrue over the course of a 25- or 30-year career.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a lethargic Friday night defeat to Brown, the Crimson had nothing standings-wise to compete for against Yale. Regardless of the outcome, Harvard would play in the 2-3 contest next Saturday in the Ivy Tournament.
But Saturday night’s rivalry contest against Yale was about so much more for these players — pride, self-confidence, and respectability. That message was expressed in the upstairs film room on Saturday morning, where team co-captain Henry Welsh gave a spirited speech to his team.
“Henry gave a great speech talking about what this game meant to him and how important it was, making sure that we are not letting any opportunities pass us by,” senior guard Justin Bassey said, “That really got us fired up and ready to bring our best effort today.”
Coach Tommy Amaker’s words this morning also resonated with the team, who responded impassionately Saturday night in a 83-69 rout of the Bulldogs. The Crimson’s energy permeated noticeably on the defensive end, where Harvard’s Robert Baker and Chris Ledlum combined for six rejections. A bevy of steals — seven to be exact — contributed to 10 fast-break points, highlighted by a Top-10 worthy 360 slam by first-year Chris Ledlum in the second half.
“I definitely think it was [Coach Amaker] putting that fire back under us this morning,” junior guard Rio Haskett said. “He really dug into us a little bit. We watched film and we just looked like, that’s not us. We don’t know what it was, whether us young guys didn’t take it seriously enough for the seniors…. And it started on defense, once our defense is going, I think our offense just feeds off of that.”
With four of its top guards in suits — including sophomore Noah Kirkwood who was ruled out by the medical staff tonight according to Coach Amaker — the Crimson went deeper into its bench, giving sophomore Kale Catchings his first valuable minutes of the season. First-years Luka Sakota and Idan Tretout also earned increased playing time, complementing starters Rio Haskett and Chris Ledlum. Tretout and Haskett both finished in double figures with 11 and 14 points, respectively with Bassey leading the team with 19 points.
“I thought we brought a sense of urgency here,” Amaker said, “We had to beat a very good team, and we did — I thought we did in convincing fashion….I thought we had a great team performance and you can see how the numbers reflect that with playing as many guys as we did.”
Yale’s Azar Swain, who torched the Crimson with 33 points in the prior outing, was limited to a 3-of-11 night for 13 points, while senior Jordan Bruner was quieted to a four-point game. The two teams matched up evenly in the opening frame, but a surge of momentum beginning with a Lewis fast-break dunk with about seven to play provided the defensive spark Harvard badly needed. Baker’s four blocks all came in that energetic span of four minutes.
“A lot of [Baker’s] blocks, he’s not just sending it to the stands,” Bassey said. “He’s blocking it and someone’s coming up with it or someone else is grabbing it. That allows us to get up the floor and get it quick.”
Harvard built up a double-digit lead within the first two minutes of the second frame, seeing easy opportunities at the rim. Sophomore Mason Forbes was the beneficiary of two alley-oops, while Haskett drained two deep triples to extend the Harvard lead to 17. Shooting 3-of-4 on the night from long range and a career-best 38.8 percent this season, Haskett has quickly become a crucial contributor on the offensive side for the Crimson.
“Over the summer, Coach told me to work on my shot and work on my form,” Haskett said. “So that’s really all I worked on, it was really just my guide hand...he said if I’m open and I catch that ball, shoot — don’t think about it.”
A series of layups at the rim by Yale’s Paul Atkinson — who finished with a team-high 23 points — kept the Bulldogs within striking distance, but the contest was all but decided heading into the final media timeout with the Crimson leading by 18. Harvard concluded the contest with 12 assists and a 69.6 field goal completion rate in the second frame.
“Tonight is one of those ones where you can really put in the bank and refer back to at some point, and talk about and use it,” Amaker said. “Get them to completely buy in or believe in it. It’s a constant ongoing process. But you need these moments that when they’ve done it and they’ve done it well… it serves its purpose down the road.”
Harvard will play Princeton in the Ivy Tournament semifinals next Saturday at 2pm. Outside of Friday night’s loss to Brown, the Crimson have not lost at Lavietes Pavilion. It needs two more wins at home — potentially the second one a rematch against the Bulldogs — to go dancing.
