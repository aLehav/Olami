After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 14, 2014, at 9:24 p.m.
The Graduate School of Design has raised more than $69 million thus far in its slice of Harvard’s $6.5 billion capital campaign, putting the school well on its way to meeting its goal of at least $110 million, John K. F. Irving ’83 said Saturday night.
Irving, a co-chair of GSD’s fundraising efforts, was among the hundreds of alumni and affiliates who flocked to Cambridge for a two-day kick-off event, called “Grounded Visionaries,” to celebrate the launch of the public phase of the school’s campaign.
“That is a big, think big, audacious kind of goal,” Irving said. “Courses in landscape architecture and architecture have been present on the Harvard campus for over 100 years. And the total endowment after this time is $400 million. So that means in the next four years we are going to raise 25 percent of what it took us 100 years to do.”
GSD administrators have said that a top priority will be the student experience, achieved through enhancements in financial aid and funding for travel and conferences.
“We find there is a growing demand for diversity of enrichment experiences.... More international travel for research, more community development work, and more engagement in professional conferences,” said alumni co-chair Philip L. Harrison ’86, CEO of the well-known design firm Perkins+Will.
Irving, who donated $10 million to GSD last December, added that the school aims to increase support for faculty, to expand and renovate the school’s facilities, and to create a new five-story research tower. Administrators are also considering reconfiguring the first-floor public spaces of Gund Hall. The building’s occupancy has grown from 300 occupants when it opened in 1972 to over 800 in 2014, according to Irving.
Irving also noted that the school hopes to use the funds generated to maintain its global presence. “We are already global, but the costs to stay in the game are significant,” Irving said, noting that the school’s global impact is “something the school can never afford to give up.”
A full weekend of programming included exhibitions, lectures, and speeches from University and school officials. A speaking program on Friday night featured remarks by the school’s dean, Mohsen Mostafavi, University President Drew G. Faust, and professor in practice of architecture and urban design Remment “Rem” L. Koolhaas.
Faust used the occasion to highlight the school’s special place in her vision of “One Harvard.” She cited examples of inter-school initiatives, including a collaboration between students at GSD and the Graduate School of Education to imagine classrooms for the year 203o as well as a partnership between two GSD students and University Professor Paul E. Farmer’s Partners in Health to build a hospital in Rwanda.
Saturday featured a number of panels featuring well-known architects such as Moshe Safdie and Jeanne Gang and exhibitions about the history and vision of GSD, urbanism, and the school’s research. The event concluded Saturday evening with a lecture by Fumihiko Maki, a prominent architect who won the 1993 Pritzker Architecture Prize, often considered “architecture’s Nobel.” Maki was introduced by fellow Pritzker laureate Thom Mayne and discussed his more than 50-year long career, including what the GSD was like when he was a student there in the late 1950s.
Maki’s lecture was followed by an outline of the campaign’s goals, a short video about the school, a short speech by a fourth-year student who discussed her experiences at the school, and the announcement of the campaign target. Guests attended a party hosted in the courtyard behind Gund Hall afterward.
“It was very important for us to have a weekend that is about ideas that matter and ideas that can really transform the built environment,” Mostafavi said in an interview after Saturday night’s lecture.
On Saturday night, as guests mingled in Gund Hall, there was a tangible feeling of excitement. K. Michael Hays, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of architectural theory at GSD, said in an interview before the event that he hopes GSD’s campaign will enhance the school’s position within the network of Harvard graduate schools.
“I think the GSD, because we are very small, is sometimes regarded as not having as much capacity to bring good effects to the University in a larger sense,” he said. “I think the campaign will show that our capacity for collaboration, our capacity to interact with other disciplines is much greater than people think.... It will show them that we are big enough in terms of resources that we can collaborate.”
After the Graduate School of Design, only a handful of schools have yet to launch their pieces of the campaign, which aims to raise $6.5 billion University-wide. The Graduate School of Education will launch its fundraising effort Sept. 19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off an Ivy League Championship in its inaugural varsity season, the Harvard women’s rugby team (0-1, 0-1 Ivy) entered the opening game of its 2014 campaign with much excitement. But fatigue played a significant role in the final 15 minutes of the contest, costing the Crimson the lead and ultimately the game, as the squad fell to Brown (1-0, 1-0 Ivy), 25-14, in the first ever varsity Ivy League women's rugby matchup.
“It was a very physical match,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “It was very tiring early on. We need to work on our fitness to make sure we can sustain that level of high energy that we had at the beginning [of the game] throughout the 80 minutes.”
With 11 minutes left in the contest, Bears’ junior scrum-half Amber Reano found a hole in Harvard’s defense and scored a try in the posts. The score set up a conversion for sophomore fly-half Sonia Rudin, which gave Brown—a team that just turned varsity over the summer—a 19-15 lead. The four-point differential put extra pressure on the Crimson, as the squad needed to score at least a 5-point try in the final 10 minutes to reclaim the lead.
With Harvard rugby alums shouting from the sidelines, the Crimson showed signs of bouncing back. Two consecutive takedowns by Harvard senior fullback Aniebiet Abasi and co-captain Kayleigh Henry at the 50 stopped the Bears’ running game and recovered the ball for Harvard.
But the Crimson could not capitalize. A line-out sailed over Kantor’s head, and Brown quickly recovered the ball, pitching it to the outside to junior fullback Saskia Morgan. Harvard’s defensive line was not spread widely enough, and the Bears broke through to score another try, taking the decisive 24-15 lead.
Despite the loss, Harvard coach Sue Parker was encouraged by her team’s performance, especially since the injury-hampered Crimson was both overmatched in size and outnumbered in the second half.
“I couldn’t be more proud of the 15 players who were on the field for us today in terms of their effort, their heart, and their grit through all 80 minutes,” Parker said.
Brown led off the scoring with a try and conversion in the 20th minute to take a 7-0 lead. But the Crimson responded four minutes later when sophomore fly-half Taciana Pereira raced the ball to the outside and scored a try.
With 11 minutes left in the first half, Harvard sophomore Mariah Turner scored a try to give the Crimson its first advantage of the game, 10-7. After Harvard squandered the lead by surrendering a try on the final play of the first half, Turner scored her second try of the game midway through the second half to give the Crimson a 15-12 lead.
Still in her first year of playing rugby, Turner has already shown the potential to pace Harvard’s offense this season.
“I’ve seen such a growth and development in her confidence as a ball carrier, over even just the past few weeks,” Kantor said. “And I’m so happy that that was reflected in the score today. I’m so proud of her, and I hope that this gives her the confidence moving forward to do even more wonderful things in the fall.”
For the Crimson, which went undefeated in Ivy League home games last fall and decisively defeated the Bears twice last season, the opening loss indicated that the team still needs to make adjustments to replace the 10 seniors it lost to graduation.
Both Parker and Kantor are confident that Harvard can and will make these adjustments.
“We are going to continue to work on our fundamentals and our fitness,” Parker said. “And then we will make sure that results in a more efficient and effective execution of the game plan against some opponents who will be equally as tough as Brown.”

In case you missed Hempfest this weekend (Sept. 13 and 14), here are some of the highlights from the 20 minutes we spent observing. If you like what you read (what?), don’t worry, it’ll happen again next year. Maybe by then it’ll all be less questionably legal.
The Booths1. Two for $10. Four for $20. Weed lollipops. There’s two things to note here: First, never again trust an adult eating a green lollipop. Second, there’s no discount for buying in bulk, even if they're making it sound like there might be.
2. There’s a wrinkled man, wearing a sandwich board, and he’s here to save all of the souls. Unlike the science center flyer-ers, he only gives flyers to those who ask. “Does anyone love you?,” his flyer poses. Answer, page 1: “He loved you!”
3. “ENROLLING NOW!!!” There’s a school, Northeastern Institute of Cannabis, that can get you certified to work in the industry in “just TWO WEEKS.” Sounds about as long as econ. concentrators spend on their theses.
4. X Growth Systems sells plants. Girls with flowers in their hair, baggy pants, and lollipops in their mouths are the type who are interested in this.
The Stage5. A rock band sings to the comically small crowd, “One stop to Jamaica, one stop to Jamaica.” When they finish playing, they yell, “Make some noise Boston!” Boston makes no noise.
6. Three kids sit eating ice cream with their mom 20 feet from the stage. No lollipops for them.
The Lawn7. Gregory H. Daugherty, the Spare Change salesman from the Square, tries to convince a man wearing a shirt that says boobies in four different languages to buy his paper. Well hellllllllllllo there, gentleman.
8. A group of friends eat chili fries out of a dog bowl.
9. Face-painted, a guitarist moves from cop to cop, playing music inches away from their faces as his friend films. “I thought we were best friends,” one officer says drily after he’s been abandoned.
Back to the T10. One unnamed revolutionary tour guide in full dress walks through Hempfest between tours. “My pot smoking days are over,” he says, his face and tri-corner cap turning toward us. “I get paranoid.”
