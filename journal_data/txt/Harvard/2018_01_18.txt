After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the show has garnered a reputation for its handling of dark, controversial subject matter, Season Four of “Black Mirror” dips a toe into somewhat uncharted territory: happy, or at least hopeful, endings. The show operates best when it doesn’t rely on gore or violence, as proven by last season’s Emmy-winning “San Junipero,” a nostalgic romance about simulated reality. Few episodes exemplify hope better than “Hang the DJ,” a dystopian take on dating apps like Tinder, directed by Tim Van Patten.
In the episode, a society-wide dating system pairs up couples temporarily, then feeds each individual’s reaction into an algorithm that sorts them into yet another couple. After Amy (Georgina Campbell) and Frank (Joe Cole) are paired together for their first trial, both characters suffer a series of loveless relationships, each one more tediously robotic than the last. There’s sex, lust, and desire, but the real intimacy is in the stolen moments: hands held over the sheets, a meaningful glance across the room, a quiet conversation at twilight. “Must have been mental before the system,” Amy reflects in one such scene. “People had to do the whole relationship thing themselves.” In a world where complex algorithms referee hookups and dates, “Hang the DJ” tackles not just romance, but autonomy and free will. It’s a celebration of love, but more importantly, the extent we will go to get it. Coupled with Brooker’s impactful dialogue, Van Patten’s careful direction tackles love without schmaltz, setting up for a gut-wrenching plot twist in the episode’s final minutes—a typical “Black Mirror” device, wielded with maximum impact. The course of true love never did run smooth, but it sure packed a punch.

The optimism of the preceding episode, “Hang the DJ,” is immediately counterbalanced with the bleak nihilism of “Metalhead,” a post-apocalyptic survival story. Directed by David Slade, “Metalhead” takes its inspiration from Boston Dynamics’ “dogs,” the unnervingly autonomous robots with frighteningly advanced physical capabilities. The robot dogs in “Metalhead” are on a new level: not only can they run, jump, and stand up when knocked over, they can also use solar power to charge, track electric signals and vital signs, and detonate deadly shrapnel bombs. Like the other episodes this season, “Metalhead” features a dynamic female lead: Bella (Maxine Peake), a dauntlessly ingenuitive survivor who tries to outsmart the killer robot, even in her darkest hour. Peake’s performance is richly human. While she devises schemes to distract or weaken the robot dog, she’s also acknowledging pain, wincing after digging a GPS tracker from her thigh, or gagging at the sight of a dead body, the sorts of vulnerabilities usually absent from a typical action hero’s infallible façade. However, despite Peake’s vivid acting, there’s frankly nothing narratively meritorious about the monotony of survival when the outcome is so transparently futile—an effect compounded even further by shooting in black-and-white. The final image is meant to be one of humanity, a kind of symbolic Turing test, but it’s a tough sell after forty minutes of bloodlust.

There’s a popular theory circulated on Internet fan forums that suggests that all episodes of “Black Mirror” occur in the same universe. The concluding episode of Season Four of “Black Museum,” seems to confirm this hypothesis, featuring Easter eggs from nearly every episode in the series.
Structured similarly to “White Christmas,” which featured three nested stories, the episode begins with Nish (Letitia Wright) stopping by the titular Black Museum, a roadside collection of interesting items. Only instead of dusty antiques, the Museum showcases “authentic criminological artifacts,” each with their own grisly history. There’s a webbed helmet that allows a wearer to transmit medical symptoms to another party, a teddy bear with its own conscious inhabitant, and most horrifically, a digital captive, wrongly accused of murder, subjected to unending torture. “Black Museum” is the show at its most self-referential, a throwback kind of fan service. It’s a treat for dedicated viewers of the show, tending to rely on tried-and-true tropes of episodes past: stored consciousness, the nested, three-story arc that somersaults back to reference itself.
But to that point, “Black Museum” seems to be “White Christmas” Part II, an unwanted sequel. A rehashing of prior concepts, it might have succeeded if it had reassessed its subject matter, or revisited it in a different way. But it fails to say anything new. A worthy, albeit risky, direction could have pursued the mass incarceration angle: further exploring the symbolism of an innocent black man, unlawfully and eternally tortured, all for sadistic public entertainment and a profit. The “Black” in its title feels particularly pointed. After all, “Black Mirror” already tests the ethical limits of technology—why not justice, too?

North Bend, my hometown, is a five-minute drive from a nearly endless stretch of cornfields on one side, and, on the other, is just down the road from Cincinnati’s urban center.
Along with the other few hundred thousand people living near-but-not-in Cincinnati, I have a hometown that is not unusual for the state of Ohio. With two other medium-sized cities, numerous rural counties, and manufacturing in the north, Ohio serves as a suitable microcosm for the country as a whole. Maybe, then, it should not be surprising that Columbus, Ohio has become corporations’ go-to market for testing products. Maybe, then, it should not be surprising that political analysts use Ohio and its neighboring states as litmus tests for national candidates.
In this vein, pundits and journalists have gone beyond swing states to study Midwestern voters and understand how Donald Trump managed to upend traditionally Democratic strongholds in the Rustbelt. As I sat through events at the Institute of Politics last semester, I time and again heard my home state brought up. At the IOP and elsewhere, writers and politicians have reflected on the 2016 election by noting that Donald Trump is able to connect with manufacturing workers, that he uses the language of rural farmers, and that he simply understands the voters in those Midwestern states that first come to speakers’ minds: Michigan… Nebraska… Ohio…
We must move beyond this analysis.
After a shocking political jolt like 2016, it can be easy to snap up the first answer that comes to mind. Trump did win rural voters, and he did use simpler language than other candidates. Hillary Clinton did fail to connect with everyday Americans. But the common man, as portrayed by nearly every political analyst, is more myth than fact. The places that delivered Trump his victory, like North Bend itself, are too complex to simplify down to a uniform mold under the title of the common man.
As evidence of this, Ohio has not elected a myriad of local Trumps to fill its offices, but it instead maintains relatively moderate politics, sending one Republican and one Democrat each to the U.S. Senate. Moreover, its Republican governor, John Kasich, has routinely opposed Trump, just as when he offered a more policy-minded presidential campaign in 2016. Though the Rustbelt as a whole has generally imitated this centrism, it has nonetheless been pointed to as an insurgent region, with The Atlantic going so far as to refer to it as a second America.
The flaws of this analysis reach far beyond the 2016 election, as they risk using Trump’s vulgar rhetoric as a guide rather than a cautionary tale. Journalists and politicians at Harvard and elsewhere have focused on the common man approach because of the assumption that it is necessary to securing must-win states in future elections, despite the narrow margins that separated the presidential candidates in the Rustbelt. As one of the analyses itself points out, in The New York Times, however, Trump’s “ultimate triumph was driven less by region than by race and class.”
With this in mind, it is not shocking that the false narrative driving the common man argument has been used by right-wing bloggers and pundits to normalize racist feelings and statements. After Trump’s disparaging remarks about Haiti and parts of Africa, for instance, Tucker Carlson defended the comments, saying, “President Trump said something that almost every single person in America actually agrees with.” Despite the simple falsehood of the statement, Carlson’s argument represents a larger trend: the normalization of Trump’s racism by assuming his widespread support from the common man.
To reverse this trend, political pundits and Democratic leaders have to address a certain level of arrogance that underlies their analyses. Speakers must not hold the underlying assumption that connecting with Rustbelt voters and moving away from elitism requires reflexively imitating Trump’s actions and language. If this remains a foregone conclusion, we will not only ignore the president’s low approval ratings, but more politicians will almost certainly follow Trump’s lead and further normalize bigoted language in hopes of securing Midwestern votes.
The politics of Ohio as a whole, or most other Rustbelt states, can offer a clearer depiction of our country’s political landscape than the myth of the common man. Delivering a near balance between Republicans and Democrats, Midwestern voters are far from being irredeemably bound to the current Republican party or to Trump’s rhetoric. Rather—as a state filled with a variety of demographics—Ohio points towards a possible opening where a presidential candidate could appeal to any number of voters with concrete policies. But before this can happen, intellectuals from the halls of the IOP to the Democratic Party have to end the idea that these voters make their electoral decisions in a fundamentally different process than others. Otherwise, the focus will remain on rhetoric over policy, upholding Trump as an example rather than a cautionary tale and prolonging the false belief that America is divided.

College can be incredibly stressful, and Harvard’s culture of everyone pushing themselves to their limits all the time can put students in a mindset of overexertion and exhaustion. We often talk about self-care as specific tasks done after or during stressful situations as ways to recuperate. But it’s also important to make self-care a priority every day, not just when life is particularly stressful. (Because, let’s be honest, daily life at Harvard is usually pretty stressful.) While you’re juggling classes, extracurriculars, work, and everything else, remember to take time to care for yourself.
Decluttering your schedule might be one of the most effective forms of self-care. Make a list of all your commitments, why you’re doing them, and how long they take. Then try to place them all in a calendar, including time for meals, homework, travel, sleep, and leisure. You’ll probably notice that either they don’t all fit or you’re cutting corners somewhere to make them fit. Do yourself a favor next semester and try to cut some commitments to make your schedule more manageable.
But, I know schedule changes can be difficult. So, I’ve compiled some simpler tips for self-care. These are small changes that can be integrated into your daily schedule and will hopefully make your time here at Harvard a little easier. Many of them are obvious, but I’m constantly reminding myself to do them because it’s easy to forget when I’m swamped.
I regularly go to bed past 4 a.m. and have seen the sunrise countless times, but ideally, I’d like to go to bed by midnight and get nine hours a night. Setting a calendar alert on my phone around midnight to remind me to go to bed has helped me renormalize the idea of sleeping at a reasonable time instead of staying up as late as possible. But, if your weekday sleep schedule is ruined beyond repair, at least try to keep your weekends free to catch up on sleep.
Exercising can be a great de-stresser. If you don’t go to the gym, even small tasks like taking a stroll around your house or stretching in your room can help get your blood flowing. If and however you exercise, treat your body well because you love it, not because you feel pressured to look a certain way.
Remember to eat. If you truly can’t fit a meal into your schedule, at least pack snacks that you can take on the go, like muffins or fruit.
If hanging out with friends is relaxing for you, try to make time for that (even if you have to use When2meet!). This semester, I’ve set a goal to block out one hour each week to catch up with a friend I don’t usually see. Prioritize the quality of time spent, too. Even if you see the same people everyday, try to also have more intentional check-ins to find out how everyone’s really doing.
Time alone can also be important. There’s nothing wrong with planning chunks of time for just hanging out by yourself. If I’ve already decided to spend the night in and a friend invites me out, I’m working on being comfortable turning them down because I already have plans.
I like to study in the same few spots: the Law School, the ledge around Widener, and my bed. While Lamont works for some people, too many hopeless nights in the basement have soured the entire building for me, and I can’t study there anymore without feeling stressed out. I’ve talked to a few freshmen who study in Lamont and hate it, but they don’t know where else to go. If you haven’t yet found a study spot that’s productive and comfortable, ask around for recommendations or just wander through different buildings—you’ll probably stumble upon a quiet nook or study space.
When possible, try to leave at least 15 minutes between each scheduled activity in your day to give time for travel, time to recollect, etc. Even if you don’t feel like you need the time, it’s nice to know that you have it in case you want to take a quick break. This might also help you be more present during each part of your day, as you won’t be as worried about leaving each activity on time and rushing to the next thing.
Try to make your dorm as comfortable as possible, as that can be a positive space to come home to every day. Some people put up fairy lights or decorate their room to make it feel more personalized. A calming bedtime routine can help center you after a busy day and wind down your brain for bed. I have a cozy bathrobe that I throw on once I settle in for the evening, and then I watch Buzzfeed Tasty videos right before I sleep. Others might have a cup of tea or read for fun every night. Find something simple that works for you.
Overall, if there’s a small adjustment you can make to your life that will make you a bit happier, do it! And if you’re looking for external support around campus, check out Counseling and Mental Health Services, the Bureau of Study Counsel, and the peer counseling groups: Room 13, ECHO, Response, Contact, and Indigo.
Remember, you are more than your degree, more than your activities, and more than your schedule. First and foremost, you are a person, worthy of respect, care, and comfort, from others and yourself. Setting aside bits of time each day to care for yourself can help you be a more fulfilled, complete person.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During winter recess, I embarked on a five-day trip to Estelí, Nicaragua with a group of Harvard undergraduates as part of a Global Medical Brigade. On the first day, we contributed to a long-term effort to build a distribution system for clean water. On the following four days, we prepared medicines for and assisted a clinic led by a local team of health care professionals and community volunteers.
At first glance, such a trip seemed like voluntourism. How much could a group of undergraduates actually accomplish in five days? Whereas volunteers might gain resume points or social media capital, the communities would likely be left with unfinished projects, no better than where they had started. Thankfully, taking advantage of communities outright was less of a concern on this trip; Global Brigades is a scrupulous international non-profit with full-time professionals on-location, and we could count on them to follow up with communities.
This in mind, I was grateful for the opportunity to learn and determined to find some way to be helpful. But I worried still that we would overestimate our impact, disrespect the communities who hosted us, or forget that we might benefit more from the trip than they did. I felt that we had focused too much on how disadvantaged Nicaraguans are and not enough on their vibrant culture during our weekly meetings the semester leading up to the trip.
During a reflection session the evening following our first day, many of us had happy stories to share about connecting with community members while working together and again when they treated us to a tour of their local pottery business.
It became clear, however, that many still had the doubts I had coming into the trip. One group voiced to the trip coordinator their dismay at how little we had done; the digging in the morning had lasted no more than two hours, and the tour of the pottery facility was effectively an afternoon off. Why had we not simply donated the money raised for the trip, allowing the community to hire its own local workers to complete the project in a fraction of the time?
The coordinator, a local, full-time Global Brigades worker who understood the needs of the communities better than any of us, patiently explained how the Nicaraguan government is closely involved in planning and subsidizing brigades in ways it may not be for local, independent projects. Moreover, the community members wanted to share their stories with us.
Indeed, in what would become a routine end-of-day ceremony, local community leaders working on the water project had gathered us around earlier and thanked us for joining them, reassured us that the work we had done was good, and implored us not to forget their communities.
As undergraduates from a well-known American university—as long as we treated local communities with the utmost respect, owned up to the limited individual difference we made, and did not pretend to be doctors—maybe we offered a certain sense of legitimacy that benefited all parties involved.
We were not the only brigade in Nicaragua, however, or even at our hotel in Estelí, which showed us that not all trips like ours walk this line well. Undergraduates from another Boston-area college repeatedly spoke over the group of Nicaraguan health care professionals we hosted for a Q&A on our penultimate evening of the trip.
The eve of our first clinical day represented the final opportunity to practice taking blood pressure for triage, and a sizable portion of the group partook. I had not been able to take a single blood pressure throughout all our meetings the past semester.
“Watch, he’s going to get it his first try,” someone said, referring to one of the few volunteers who wasn’t a pre-med. We laughed; nothing says Harvard pre-med like not being able to take a blood pressure. In the three days that followed, I did not see a single volunteer try to diagnose a patient, allaying one of my biggest concerns about the trip.
On our last clinic day, I was assigned to be the kids’ “charla,” a coveted role that combines dental hygiene educator, ultimate frisbee player, and babysitter. I was joined by a friend and fellow volunteer who brought to the trip the kind of energy, personality, and compassion that sometimes means the difference between a dreadful Harvard experience and a transformative one.
He had arrived in Managua with frisbees, footballs, soccer balls, and tennis balls, steadily giving them away at the end of each day until one tennis ball remained.
One of the kids had a cannon of an arm and soon drew a small crowd of spectators. We marveled as the ball sailed across a long field to my friend. A short while later, his mother and brother were waiting for him, and he sped off.
“Wait!” my friend shouted the boy’s name. He held up the ball. “Es tuyo." The boy hesitated. “Es tuyo. Llévatelo.” Don’t worry, it’s yours. “Gracias,” the boy said.
He tossed the boy the ball.

Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, a Harvard Square staple since 1950, is planning to open a second location of its specialty food store in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood.
The planned 101 Seaport Boulevard storefront is a 20  minute drive from Cardullo’s sole current location at 6 Brattle St. Cardullo’s is Harvard Square’s oldest deli and is known for its wine, cheese, and international gourmet foods.
Richard Wilson, co-owner of Cardullo’s with his wife, Kim Wilson, said the new store will be “identical” to the Cambridge location, describing it as “Cardullo’s Two.”
The Boston Licensing Board met Wednesday morning to discuss a requested alcohol license for the new Cardullo’s store and plans to announce a final decision Thursday. Wilson said he is hopeful the license will be granted.
The  Brattle St. property housing the original Cardullo’s and other Square businesses was recently sold by the Dow and Stearns family trust to Asana Partners as part of a $108 million deal. Wilson said, though, that he does not believe the recent property sale will affect his store.
Wilson said Cardullo’s has a good relationship with its new property owner.
“It’s our intention as the business owners to stay here for a long time," he said. 
The gourmet deli, which Frank N. Cardullo founded in 1950, remained in the family for three generations until the founder's granddaughters Donez Cardullo-Tavilla and Francesca Cardullo sold the shop in 2015.
The planned new location, 101 Seaport Boulevard, is a 17-story office building occupied primarily by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers’s northeast headquarters.
After obtaining his alcohol license, Wilson said he will need to remodel the new Cardullo's, but plans to open the location in May.
“We’ve had a great time [in the Square], and we’re looking to bring the brand to a new, exciting part of Boston that’s developing,” Wilson said.
Wilson added he thinks the proximity of the two Cardullo’s stores will allow employees and managers to move between both locations, something he said will be helpful for both shops.

UPDATED: January 17, 2018 at 11:52 p.m. 
Blue Bottle Coffee will open its liege waffle and avocado toast-filled doors within the next few months, nearly half a year later than the eatery had initially planned.
Jamie Mesenburg, a spokesperson for Blue Bottle, said that they plan to open the coffee shop, located at 40 Bow St., sometime “this winter.”
The coffee shop will fill a storefront location at the Hurst Gallery building, which has sat empty for over four years.
The property was purchased by Hong Kong billionaire and prominent Harvard donor Gerald L. Chan in Jan. 2013, and subsequent restoration work on the building has focused on repairing the building’s exterior.
In Feb. 2017, the Cambridge Zoning Board approved the operation of a restaurant on the bottom floor of the 40 Bow St. property, but the process of opening has suffered multiple delays.
Blue Bottle first aimed for an opening in late summer 2017, according to their website. But over the summer, Blue Bottle told Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, that they instead planned to open in December.
Now, the store plans to open at some point this winter. Mesenburg declined to provide a specific opening date, but the interior of the store—visible from the street—already contains tables, chairs, and a bar.
Construction work on the site is currently ongoing. Along with the Blue Bottle project manager, a construction worker surveyed the location Tuesday.
Blue Bottle coffee specializes in “single-origin” coffee, coffee beans grown at a single location. The company was founded in 2002 in Oakland, Calif., and now has stores in cities nationwide and in Tokyo.
The Cambridge cafe will offer a rotation of single-origin coffees and will serve pastries and food items like seasonal salads and chia pudding, bringing “another bougie addition to Harvard Square,” as one student said in 2016.
Blue Bottle Coffee is not the only renovation in the works at one of Chan’s multiple Harvard Square properties. Last year, Chan’s investment company, Morningside Group, announced a full renovation of the old Harvard Square Theater on Church Street.
However, like Blue Bottle, the Theater sat empty for years, sparking threats of seizure by the Cambridge City Council in 2017. Chan debuted his renovation plans shortly afterwards.

African and African American Studies Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Germanic Languages and Literatures and Folklore and Mythology Professor Maria Tatar have won a 2018 NAACP Image Award for their collaboration on a book of folktales.
The Image awards, presented each year on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, acknowledge “outstanding achievements and performances of people of color in the arts, as well as those individuals or groups who promote social justice through their creative endeavors,” according to a NAACP website.
Gates and Tatar first place in the “Outstanding Literary Work (Fiction)” category for their book "The Annotated African American Folktales." The text is a compilation of tales from oral storytelling traditions taken from African as well as African-American cultures.
“Professor Gates and I begin with African traditions, folktales, and myths and then look at how that culture migrated with enslaved peoples into the Americas,” Tatar said.
Tatar said the importance of language is a theme throughout the collection.
“The one [theme] that emerged very quickly as we were collecting these stories is the importance of language and also of wit, wit in the sense of humor and jokes but also wit in the sense of intelligence and cunning, trying to get yourself out of the worst-case possible scenario,” Tatar added.
Gates, a prominent figure in the field of African American studies, serves as the director of the Hutchins Center, Harvard's African American studies branch. Tatar, who has authored books on the brothers Grimm and fairy tales, said "Folktales" was her first major project centered on African and African-American folklore.
“Like many scholars working today, I really enjoy reinventing myself every ten years or so, so it’s been great to go from Grimm and Andersen and J.M. Barrie—the world of folklore and children’s literature—to something completely different,” Tatar said.
Gates and Tatar have known each other for decades. Their partnership on "Folktales" began when an editor they both work with suggested it.
“This was such a huge, ambitious project that neither one of us dared to go solo on it... but because I knew that [Professor Gates] would be working with me it seemed doable,” Tatar said.
The four other works nominated by the NAACP literature committee in the fiction category were novels.
“I think there was a realization [by the NAACP committee members] that this was an extraordinary cultural heritage that had not been written down, and had more or less vanished....Oral storytelling traditions are the literature of times past, so I think in an interesting way we were in the right category,” Tatar said.
While the anthology was focused on African and African-American lore, Tatar said her research prompted questions about other cultures’ folktale traditions.
“The great challenge for me was to try to figure out why we tell children stories from Germany and from France and from England,” she said. “Where is our native lore?  What happened to the vernacular, to the stories that were part of an oral storytelling culture in early centuries?”

UPDATED: January 18, 2018 at 7:10 p.m.
Massachusetts politicians called on Harvard to pay “almost the entire cost” of a nearly $100-million proposed transportation station in Allston in a public letter released Wednesday.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority announced plans to build West Station, a commuter rail station slated to connect Allston to Boston and the surrounding area, in Oct. 2014. Harvard pledged at the time to pay one third of the building costs.
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation originally planned to complete West Station by 2025, but—in an updated proposal in late 2017—the department announced it will instead begin construction nearly two decades later in 2040, in part due to financial concerns. In a public comment letter appended to the updated proposal Wednesday, five elected Massachusetts officials protested the delay and proposed a solution: They think the University should cover a larger portion of the construction costs.
“We believe that Harvard University should pay more than 1/3 of the cost and instead follow the example that New Balance set at Boston Landing by covering almost the entire cost of the station construction,” the politicians wrote.
In the document, the letter’s signatories—comprising Massachusetts senators Sal N. DiDomenico and William N. Brownsberger '78, state representatives Kevin G. Honan and Michael J. Moran, and Boston City Councillor Mark Ciommo—noted the size of Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment. The five officials wrote that the University is “one of the wealthiest” non-profit organizations in the world.
“It is really not a lot to ask of Harvard University,” the politicians wrote in the letter.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that the University’s support for West Station “has not wavered” since the school’s initial commitment to fund a third of the building’s construction. She did not specifically say whether Harvard plans to pay more of the development costs.
“The Allston interchange project, including West Station, will bring significant public benefits and Harvard is pleased to have already made important contributions towards its viability,” O’Rourke wrote. “The University...remains committed to working with the Commonwealth, the City, MassDOT and all stakeholders towards a comprehensive vision that will contribute to the entire region.”
The construction price tag for West Station will likely fall between $89 and $96 million dollars, according to Commonwealth Magazine. If Harvard does foot a third of the bill, the University would spend between $29.6 and $32 million dollars.
Moran, one of the letter’s signatories, said in an interview Wednesday that he has been in contact with officials at the University; he said he has received “a few phone calls” from Harvard. But he said he and other locals want a more definitive public statement from the school.
“We in the community would like to hear that Harvard wants West Street Station—and that they want it so much that they want to pay for it,” Moran said. “I hear from them that they're supportive of West Station, but I've yet to see it verbalised or written, something that would enshrine their position.”
Moran pointed, in particular, to the way shoe manufacturing company New Balance paid for the construction of Boston Landing Station as a model for Harvard to follow. New Balance financed the entire cost of the more-than-$20 million transportation stop, located in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston.
“Simply right up the street, you see where Jim Davis and Anna Davis from New Balance paid for the beautiful stuff up there,” Moran said. “I don't know how a corporation the size of [Harvard] can't find a way to pay for this station, but New Balance and Jim Davis and Anna Davis can. That doesn't really make sense to me.”
Moran said he has received a mostly positive response to his public letter so far. He said he has received multiple emails from different people thanking him for writing the letter and thanking him for “sticking up” for them.
Moran added he thinks West Station is more than “just a stop.”
“This is a huge, huge opportunity [for Harvard] to do something what I would say, ‘Right,’” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing its highest-ranked opponent yet in a mid-week matchup, Harvard women’s hockey took on No. 2/3 Boston College on the Eagles’ home ice. Despite lineup changes for the Crimson, the home team’s talent proved too much, as the Eagles (20-2-3, 13-1-3 WHEA) skated away with a 6-2 win. Harvard (8-8-1, 6-5-1 ECAC) has now lost all three of its games against top-10 teams in the past five days, having been outscored 16-8.
“The last time we played them, I thought we really backed off,” said coach Katey Stone in a video, referring to an 8-1 loss against BC in late November. “[On Tuesday] we really went at them.”
Coaching staff moved junior defender Kaitlin Tse to left wing on the top line, choosing to play only two defensive pairings. Freshman Brooke Jovanovich moved down to the second line, where she began the season, and the productive trio of junior Bradley Fusco, rookie Becca Gilmore, and sophomore forward Kat Hughes were separated. Despite the Crimson’s recent string of losses, Gilmore’s performances have stood out, as she posted her sixth multi-point game this weekend and earned ECAC Rookie of the Week honors. Gilmore, however, did not find the scoresheet against BC.
“Playing against a deficit definitely creates a sense of urgency,” said Hughes. “But as a team we need to remember to stick to the basics and not get too on edge.”
One positive the Crimson can take from the loss is breaking a dry run of 16 scoreless power plays. Harvard’s second goal of the game came on the player-advantage. With just over a minute to go in regulation, a slapshot from sophomore defender Ali Peper took a bounce off the back boards to co-captain Haley Mullins, who chipped it past Eagles assistant captain and netminder Katie Burt. Discipline, which has proved to be an issue for the Crimson in the past, was also spotless on Tuesday, as the team did not incur a single whistle while drawing three calls.
“We haven't seen a lot of success recently [on the power play],” Hughes said. “With time and practice, our power play units will grow some better chemistry and we'll be able to capitalize on more opportunities.”
The Eagles were already leading, 4-0, when Harvard first broke the ice. 12 minutes into the third period, freshman blueliner Kate Glover found rookie forward Keely Moy behind the goal line. Moy fed Nikki Friesen, her senior linemate, just inside the left circle; Friesen’s top-shelf chip brought the score to 4-1. The tally was Friesen’s first of the season.
After Mullins’s goal brought Harvard within three, any slim hopes of a last-minute surge were dashed with 50 seconds to play. With the score already at 5-2, BC sophomore Erin Connolly beat Crimson goaltender Beth Larcom with a snipe from the dot, sealing Harvard’s fate. Unlike on Saturday, when freshman Becky Dutton played in relief against Cornell, Larcom weathered all 60 minutes of the Eagles’ offense.
Before Connolly’s nail in the coffin, five different players found twine for BC. Junior captain Makenna Newkirk and freshman Maegan Beres each had three points on the night; Newkirk’s 47 points are tied for third in the country. Freshman Daryl Watts and sophomore Caitrin Lonergan, first and second in points in the country respectively, also added to the scoreboard.
“Even though they scored early, we picked our heads up and continued to work hard and got a lot of offensive opportunities,” Moy said.
The shot tally reflected that: the Crimson outshot its opponents, 38-30. While the skew might have to do with Harvard’s time on the power play, the team will look to finish its chances and continue its offensive efforts in the coming weekend. The Crimson takes the ice again on Jan. 19, playing host to ECAC leader No. 2/2 Clarkson.
