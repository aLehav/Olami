After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent spate of crime on and near campus should above all remind the Harvard community that an inherent level of danger is built into the Cambridge environment. Clearly, Harvard is not located within a violent inner city. Cambridge is nowhere near as dangerous as many American metropolises or other college campuses. Even so, the sooner that we collectively realize that we do not live in a quaint village ruled by the University, the sooner we can all take actions that help keep us safe.
As the Harvard University Police Department so often reminds students, we live in an “urban environment” and must face up to this reality. Given a recent uptick in armed robberies, an increased police presence was of course the right move. More resources should continue to be poured into active policing, but students must also adjust their attitudes and behavior in light of these events.
The group of undergraduates who recently launched a petition calling for the Yard to be closed off at night should be commended for voicing their concerns through this format. Students should feel empowered to speak up more often about threats to their safety. In terms of the specific actions they suggest, we do not think that limiting access to the Yard after sundown so that only those bearing Harvard I.D.s can enter would offer a solution in itself to the greater problem. However, this might very well improve safety in the Yard at night, something that has naturally come into focus after the recent armed robbery outside Thayer Hall.
Harvard could do more to remind students about the existence of resources such as the Harvard University Campus Escort Program and blue light phones. Undergraduates would be doing themselves and their peers a service by using HUCEP—a campus safety initiative that provides student escorts who walk University affiliates to their destinations during the night—more often, whether or not this current rate of crime persists. Even if students do not feel they need to utilize HUCEP, they should still do so in order to legitimize the service across campus.
As a community, we must remember to applaud HUPD for responding by upping its visibility and number of police officers. The quantity of arrests last week and the fact that the recent armed-robbery attempt on Brattle Street was foiled by a police officer show that sincere efforts are already being made to reduce crime. Although students do have serious grounds for concern, these events do not merit hysteria. The fact that Cambridge is not an isolated village but instead an extension of Boston’s urban setting simply means that we should behave more as we would in the heart of a big city and so take more vigilant precautions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was an odd mix of sounds currently invading my common room two nights ago. Amidst the usual Saturday night clamor of drunken singing and shouting, there was a new addition to the cacophony. The victorious and glorious Harvard-Yale night brought with its jubilation the vuvuzela to Cantabrigian streets.
The Athletics Department banned the use of not only vuvuzelas, but also artificial noisemakers as a whole at the Game. Beside the fact that banning all artificial noisemakers seems a little excessive—vuvuzelas do indeed result in auditory harm, but there are surely noisemakers that are not of the same danger level—as predicted, both Harvardians and Yalies alike resorted to expressing school spirit via vuvuzelas in other, less appropriate, places.
For example, one of the egregious alternative uses for the vuvuzelas was to augment the conviviality of the merry wanderers of the night. Personally, this was more disruptive than what I imagine would have been the case were the thousands in attendance at the Game to have wielded artificial noisemakers. (I blame the College for this cacophanous interruption of my Saturday night, as I was only forced into working on my assignments due on Monday because, unlike those lazy Yalies, we have class this week.)
The bigger issue, however, is what occurred during the game. Sadly, unlike Las Vegas, what happens at the game does not always stay at the game. My voice, like Mr. Darcy’s good opinion, once lost is lost forever—or at least, for many more hours than I can exist in a state of wakefulness without speaking effectively. Although this may reveal a personality flaw—my inability to remain silent—the state of my pharyngitis is rather upsetting. Why, you ask, is my throat in such a disparaging state of soreness? The culprits are my school spirit and this wretched vuvuzela ban.
Harvard students are oft accused of lacking school spirit—many a Yalie has mentioned that though Yale may have lost the Game (for the fourth year in a row, might I add), Yalies have greater spirit. Although this is debatable, it nonetheless raises the issue of our school spirit and how we express it. Given any football game, fans are bound to cheer on their team. Obviously, this involves much screaming, yelling, and maybe even shrieking, along with the usual array of clapping and stomping. We might also refer to these actions as noise-making. Harvardians at the Harvard-Yale game are no different! Thus, I found myself at the stadium screaming my lungs out, desperate to do what I could to cheer on the Crimson and fulfill my arduous—and maybe unexplainable—need to convey my school spirit, only to ultimately relinquish my vocal abilities at the end of the fourth quarter after spending most of the third noting the tell-tale scratchiness that had begun to creep in.
If only I had had the option of bringing along a noisemaker, then perhaps I would not now be imbibing copious amounts of tea to soothe my sore throat or attempting to speak despite a very raspy voice. Although I could try to appreciate the symbolism of my pharyngitis—it is, after all, a constant reminder of our victory over Yale—it is mostly a debilitating and painful state, and one, I believe, that would have been avoidable had I had the choice of bringing an artificial noisemaker to The Game. Instead, I had to resort to a natural noisemaker, thanks to the Athletics Department’s ban.
Permit me, then, to say to the Athletics Department: I bleed crimson in every way possible, but it would have been nice to do so while both retaining my voice and trying not to cage my school spirit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week an unidentified man behaving suspiciously fired a gun at a Cambridge Police Department officer in Harvard Square. The gunman, police determined after his arrest, had robbed several Harvard College students. A few days earlier, a man walking through Harvard Yard after midnight was robbed at gunpoint. In front of Thayer Hall, the alleged offender stole his wallet and fled the scene.
A string of several other armed robberies over the last two weeks preceded these two incidents. Harvard’s safety apparatus subsequently sent advisories to students and faculty in the community with tips on how to avoid being a victim of a robbery—or how to avoid bloodshed once a crime has commenced.
More than anything else, the rise of these robberies can be explained, it seems, in plain economic terms. As the recession continues for many debt-ridden and jobless individuals, increasing numbers of the economically afflicted are resorting to violence as a means of relief, likely to feed or house themselves or their families.
It is clear this desperation is tormenting our nation, from Boston to other metropolitan centers in which modern-day Hoovervilles are still cropping up. (To impart a family anecdote, one relative recently told me that a kid—probably not even in his early teens—jumped him in New York City as he was getting to his car to drive home from work.)
The recent criminal acts and attempted ones—it goes without saying—have frightened the living daylights out of many a Boston student. As I’ve told friends, the incidents have stopped me from making late-night Pinocchio’s pizza runs for academic fuel or getting after-hour pharmaceutical supplies from our local CVS.
Although the acts seem more visible with colleges in session, the crime problem across the Massachusetts collegiate landscape shouldn’t come as a surprise. The data here, compared to other university cities and towns, show Harvard and other Massachusetts schools to be victims of crime disproportionately.
In the Daily Beast’s compilation of the nation’s least safe schools, Tufts was ranked first and Harvard second. Three of the state’s other universities (MIT, Lesley, and Northeastern) made the top 30, and the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth branch made it within the 50-mark.
The recent Cambridge incidents and similar ones across the Bay State’s campuses testify to the online news magazine’s ranking and are reason for serious concern. Between the six of them, after calculation of the Beast’s report, there have been two murders, 222 rapes, 462 robberies, and 1948 burglaries. These numbers are more than problematic—they threaten the very livelihood of a most promising and diverse student population.
There is not a single policy prescription for correcting what has become a persistent crime issue. But the successful approach to fixing the problem will not derive from cut-and-dry liberal or conservative government policy; neither welfare nor law and order is the answer.
Instead, the community’s response should be innovative solutions born out of partnership between Boston’s universities, Governor Deval L. Patrick, and his colleagues in the Massachusetts State Assembly. First, as a practical matter, university police forces must combine intelligence and work collectively to provide ample security, especially in vulnerable campus locations where previous crimes have been reported or occurred.
But more is in order: Boston’s public and private universities should organize a series of forums on campus safety and economic security. In a united effort, with support of each university president, such an inter-collegiate alliance could orchestrate community engagements, such as city-wide soup-kitchen days, classes, and counseling hours for homeless men, women, and children of every creed and color, and larger campus-based initiatives to put people back to work.
These might include (but are certainly not limited to) the creation of campus greenhouses to be constructed, operated, and housed by homeless citizens and those in severe economic distress. Harvard and its peer schools must experiment with programs intended to combat crime and generate sustainable employment opportunities.
Coordinated inter-campus dialogue and projects of this nature can elicit a clear road for the passage of poverty-fighting and job-creating infrastructure measures across Massachusetts. Violence is not the answer is the message that will ring clear.
This is an opportunity for the newly re-elected governor and our major universities to collaborate. It is at the core of their respective charters to perform these functions—to protect our children and to ensure them a crime-free future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last day of the Supreme Court’s spring 2010 term saw the release of a Second Amendment ruling that garnered massive media response, but it was another decision issued the same day that attracted the attention of the nation’s top educators. The case, entitled Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, involved the Hasting College of the Law’s decision to deny official recognition to a student group called the Christian Legal Society based on the group’s violation of the college’s “non-discrimination policy.” Prospective CLS members had to sign a “Statement of Faith” certifying that they would conduct their lives in a manner that accorded with the group’s Christian beliefs; students who did not hold those beliefs or who engaged in “unrepentant homosexual conduct” were prevented from joining.
The Supreme Court, which upheld the college’s decision to deny recognition, was correct to point to the school’s constitutional right to distribute official recognition selectively. Universities have an invested interest in the environment created on their campuses, and they have a corresponding right to discourage groups that would disturb their desired atmosphere. Colleges should be able to regulate how they distribute resources like funding and recognition to foster the kinds of groups they deem most amenable to their campus goals. Nonetheless, this case also served as a warning to universities struggling with pluralism on their campuses. Hasting College of the Law undoubtedly had a legal right to deny recognition to CLS, but it shouldn’t have done so.
Colleges should give student groups the benefit of the doubt in determining their membership. Primarily, this is because a group’s membership is inextricably linked to its expressive rights. CLS proclaims that its mission is “[t]o inspire, encourage, and equip lawyers and law students, both individually and in the community, to proclaim, love and serve Jesus Christ through the study and practice of law.” In the organization’s view, those who violate some of the principles of Christianity cannot effectively fulfill or promote this mission and must therefore be excluded.
A student who refuses to sign a “Statement of Faith” certifying his willingness to “love and serve Jesus Christ” is clearly unable to fulfill the group’s explicitly stated mission. Therefore, the group has a right to deny him or her membership, in the same way that an athletic team can cut someone who won’t help it fulfill its mission of winning games. One wonders why a person unwilling to sign the “Statement of Faith” would even seek membership in the group, as his or her fundamental beliefs conflict with those that the group is trying to promote.
In this sense, membership matters. If a group’s members hold certain beliefs contrary to its mission, they will not be able to fulfill that mission effectively. Part of an organization’s self-definition involves how it selects its members, molding itself in a way that conforms to its primary objectives. This explains why universities should not ban groups on the basis of their membership requirements or compel them to admit certain students—doing so would distort the group’s freedom of expression by altering the membership policies that directly influence this expression.
This is not to say that groups should be able to exclude members indiscriminately; their membership policies should have some clear connection to their mission. In the case of the Christian Legal Society, it seems reasonable to monitor membership by compelling students to sign a statement asserting their agreement with the society’s beliefs; these beliefs, according to the group’s mission, play an important role in its activities and policies. However, the group should not be permitted to deny membership based on race or ethnicity, as neither of these features factor into its purpose.
At the same time, student organizations must be given broad discretion in determining how their purpose relates to their membership policies. It is the group itself that best knows its mission and the most effective means of achieving it. As a result, CLS should be permitted to exclude homosexuals despite the absence of any reference to homosexuality in its mission statement. Because the group frames itself as one promoting Christian values, and because it believes that homosexuality defies those values, it should be permitted to exclude homosexuals from the club. To paraphrase Voltaire, this does not amount to a defense of the group’s policies (I find them homophobic and excessive), but it does amount to a defense of the group’s right to adopt them. Nor is it a commentary on Christian doctrine or the role of homosexuality in this doctrine, but rather a defense of CLS’s sincere interpretation of Christian values as expressed in its mission statement.
Beyond this, universities have an active interest in promoting plurality among student groups, even if those groups fail to uphold internal standards of plurality with regard to membership policies. Colleges have long represented a place where different organizations, embodying different interests and values, can coexist and collaborate. Students should not have to fear whether their group’s beliefs conflict with those of administrators at their school.
Universities have a right to incentivize certain membership policies, but they should generally give students the benefit of the doubt. Unless they do, they limit the breadth of student groups that can pluralistically exist on college campuses, and they limit the ideas that can come into contact with one another at our nation’s highest institutions of learning.

Saudi Arabian Prince Turki Al Faisal urged his country to assume a leadership role in mitigating Middle Eastern conflicts and maintaining regional stability during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics on Friday as part of Harvard Arab Weekend.
Al Faisal—former Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States—surveyed challenges threatening peace and stability in the Middle East and claimed that Saudi Arabia’s economic and geographic strategic importance in the region could allow it to exert positive influence.
“Saudi Arabia hopes to present the world with a steady diplomatic hand, backed by growing economic and financial might, and ever increasing military power,” he said.
The challenges facing Yemen, Iraq, and Iran currently impact Saudi Arabia—the largest oil producer in the world—most, Al Faisal said.
“Saudi leaders are keenly aware of Iran’s provocative agenda. Iran’s nuclear ambition...is taken very seriously,” Al Faisal said.
Iran’s expansionist agenda has aggravated tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran on issues such as policy towards Western nations, Sunni and Shiite differences, and competition among petroleum reserves, he said.
“The key concern is a regional nuclear arms race,” Al Faisal said.
Yet, Saudi Arabia supports the use of nuclear power, he indicated.
“Acquiring peaceful uses of nuclear energy has been decided...The acquisition of nuclear energy is [our] undeniable right,” he added, noting that the Kingdom has joined the United States in signing a Memorandum of Understanding on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation in 2008.
Al Faisal also focused on Yemen, Saudi Arabia’s southern neighbor, which he said has seen increased insurgent activity and has become a security threat to Saudi Arabia’s border, and Iraq—a country which he expects to yield considerable influence in OPEC in the future and which he said has gotten a great deal of support from Saudi Arabia to achieve stability.
According to Al Faisal, Saudi leaders have focused on preventing the partitioning of Iraq and stopping foreign interference.
“As 2010 comes to a close, Saudi Arabia has gained a position of global prominence. It has led the regional response to improve Gulf security and stressed collaboration over division,” Al Faisal said.
Answering a question on women’s rights from the audience, Al Faisal said “I believe women have suffered discrimination, punishment, and unjust treatment.” He also indicated that more Saudi Arabian women than men graduate from college, and some are beginning to enter the workforce.
“Prince Turki was an impressive highlight of Harvard Arab Weekend,” said Delara Z. Alameddine ’14, a student originally from Lebanon. “[However] missing from his analysis of the region was recognition of Turkey’s increasingly pivotal role in the region.”

The 34 percent of Harvard Business School’s 2010 graduates who entered the financial services industry may be a long-term indicator of a bear stock market, says banking analyst Raphael Soifer.
Soifer, who graduated from the Business School in 1965, has used the career choices of Harvard MBA students as a market indicator since 2001.
He claims that when the rate of business school students entering the financial services industry falls below ten percent, the market is heading for a bullish or strong period. When it rises above 30 percent, he anticipates a bearish market.
Soifer set those benchmarks based on the 1982 and 2000 rates, which he said were major turnaround years for the market.
When Soifer first issued his indicator in 2001, the rate of students entering the finance sector—which he defines as investment banking, investment management, hedge funds, sales & trading, venture capital, private equity and leveraged buyouts—was about 32 percent.
“It started very informally while I was a student at the Business School. I liked to observe where my fellow students would head after college, and the alumni bulletin used to print the percentage breakdown of who went into what industry,” Soifer said. “Harvard Business School is unique in many respects, in that it really tries to train generalists. A number of other business schools have highly specialized programs that limit students’ choices after graduating, and a Harvard MBA has a wider range of positions to choose from.”
He added, “A change in the rate of Harvard Business School students going into finance is really indicative of a wider market trend.”
Melvin O. Hibberd, co-president of the Business School’s Finance Club, agreed that there may be some correlation between the number of students entering the finance industry and the overall direction of the economy.
“I would say that at the end of the day, they’re the most attractive jobs for students leaving HBS. They offer great compensation, but they also offer great training opportunities,” he said. “They look for people when times are good and stop looking when times are bad. Since bad periods follow good periods in the cyclic market, the data makes some sense.”
Hibberd pointed out that a number of other analogous market indicators exist, such as the number of houses sold every month.
“The only thing that worries me about this news is the interpretation that Harvard MBAs are causing the crisis. That’s not what’s written explicitly, but if you look at the comments at the bottom of the [Yahoo Finance] article, some people may take the data and spin it against Harvard,” he said, adding that this would be a misinterpretation. “Recent grads are not in any position to do anything particularly dangerous to the entire economy.”

Brian G. Marsden, famed astronomer and tracker of comets and asteroids, passed away on Nov. 18 due to prolonged illness. At Harvard, Marsden served as supervisory astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and as director emeritus of the Minor Planet Center.
Marsden was renowned for his proficiency in computational astronomy, calculating the positions and orbits of comets and asteroids using observational information, critical for monitoring potentially threatening objects bound for Earth. “He had an unusual facility with numbers. He could do ‘party tricks,’ like he would ask you for your birthday and he could tell you what day of the week you were born,” said Astronomy Professor Robert P. Kirshner ’70.
Among his many accomplishments, Marsden was most proud of correctly predicting the 1992 return of Comet Swift-Tuttle, the comet associated with the Perseid Meteor shower every August. Marsden became the subject of controversy in 1998, when he indicated that an object named 1997 XF11 could collide with Earth. Data from 1990 clearly proved that a collision was highly unlikely but Marsden said he did this to encourage the collection of more routine observations.
Marsden also identified a group of comets that closely passed by the Sun, now known as the “Marsden group.” However, most people recognize Marsden as the individual responsible for the demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet status. “It was hard to get an accurate mass of Pluto,” said Gareth V. Williams, Marsden’s son-in-law and director of the Minor Planet Center. “Every year the measured mass got smaller. Brian graphed the date and estimated mass of Pluto and it was a straight line downwards. The running joke was that it would disappear entirely.”
Growing up in Cambridge, England, Marsden’s mother introduced him to astronomy in 1942 as they watched a solar eclipse. Marsden however, was fascinated not by the eclipse itself but by the fact that it had been predicted in advance.
Marsden began calculating astronomical positions at age 11. He became a junior member of the Royal Astronomical Society in high school. He went on to attend New College, Oxford, where he developed an international reputation for computing orbitals of comets. After graduating, Marsden enrolled in Yale University as a graduate student, writing his Ph.D. degree thesis titled “The Motions of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter.” He served as Director of the Central Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams from 1968 to 2000.
“He was very important because he was the guy who knew things second,” said Kirshner. “If people found something, they reported it to Brian, who would then follow up and disseminate the information around the world for other scientists.” In 1978, Marsden also assumed directorship of the Minor Planet Center, the official organization attending to the discovery of asteroids, a position he held until 2006. He joined the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 1987.
“I took pretty much the same route; I was interested in computation rather than observing,” said Williams. “Brian’s name became known to me early on as this guy who would make these pronouncements. I was 14 and I wanted to know how he did it.” Williams eventually wrote his final undergraduate paper about the identification of asteroids. “No one at the university [in England] had experience in asteroids so my advisor suggested I send my write-up to Brian,” Williams said. Marsden later took Williams under his wing, offering him the position of Minor Planet Center Director and introducing him to his daughter, whom Williams married.
“I’m very grateful to Brian for a lot of things, even before I knew him,” Williams said. “For increasing my interest in computational astronomy and then for taking a risk in inviting me over to the us to work with him, for giving me my charming wife.”
“He’s left a void that will be very hard to fill,” said Williams. “We’ve lost one of the greatest astronomers of all time.”

Harvard Law School Professor Duncan M. Kennedy ’64 and Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Jeffrey D. Sachs ’76 discussed the implications of international development in Africa before a large audience at the Law School last Friday.
Kennedy and Sachs debated opposite approaches to facilitating international development, ranging from community-based organizations to more centralized international bodies. Kennedy highlighted the mobilization of activists in impoverished countries as a major step to improving conditions, while Sachs emphasized the duty of the rich to help break what he viewed as a vicious cycle of destitution.
Sachs attributed the persistent poverty of developing nations to a cycle in which impoverished countries only become more impoverished by remaining trapped in their conditions.
But according to him, today’s society is equipped with such advanced technology and tools that it has an "opportunity in history to see the end of that kind of poverty."
Kennedy criticized the poverty trap described by Sachs, arguing that such a cycle overlooks the heavy influence of capitalist development programs in producing extreme conditions of poverty.
Kennedy cited as an example the Muslim population living in the poorest area of Ghana, who are "not left behind, not trapped" by the Ghanean environment, but instead are hindered by imposition of one-size-fits-all development programs, many of which fail to take into account the needs of individual areas.
According to Kennedy, only on-ground, community-based bottom up approaches that mobilize the developing nation’s population can successfully create a sustainable plan for alleviating extreme poverty.
"Human rights or technical guidance of foreign money does not help," he added.
Sachs said that the development process leads to inevitable exploitation along the way, but added that "development is not the cause [of poverty], but an unfinished process" towards moving out of widespread poverty.
Only by continuing the development process can the most destitute nations reach a stage in which they are no longer as vulnerable to such exploitation, he said.
Friday’s talk highlighted the publication of the recent book "Stones of Hope: How African Activist Reclaim Human Rights to Challenge Global Poverty," which compiles in-field experiences of various activists throughout Africa and theoretical essays on development.

Former Harvard offensive lineman Tommy Lee Jones ’69, introduced as "the greatest Texan ever to attend Harvard" by event organizer Aaron S. Byrd ’05, presented a screening of "Harvard Beats Yale 29-29" on Friday night in the Dunster House dining hall.
The 2008 documentary by Kevin G. Rafferty II ’70 features Jones, who played in the famous 1968 game, recounting the match and recalling the players’ lives on campus at that time.
"Kevin Rafferty’s film is not only about that football game, but about what life was like here as compared to what it’s like today," Jones, a former Dunster resident, said while introducing the movie. "It contrasts the events of the game and what the people who played in it have to say about it today."
The film and the actor were well-received by Dunster enthusiasts who were all noticeably riled up for this year’s iteration of The Game on Saturday.
Acknowledging cheers from the audience, Jones joked, "You’re an awful good-looking crowd," before beginning his talk.
While freshmen who attended the Crimson Key Society showing of the film during Freshman Week may know him best for his brief cameo in "Love Story," Jones, who won an Oscar for his work in "The Fugitive," was as avid a football player as he was an actor during his college years.
He gained acceptance to the College on a need-based scholarship, and played on the offensive line for the Crimson throughout his college career.
An English concentrator who graduated cum laude, he recalled fondly his years as a scholar-athlete-thespian.
"It’s always a fun treat to see a celebrity up close and personal," said Brianne Holland-Stergar ’13, who lives in Dunster. "Knowing that he had a similar collegiate experience to mine just makes that 20 times better."
Going into the 1968 game, Yale, highly favored to win, was ranked the 16th best college football team in the nation. With only two minutes left in the game, though, Harvard made a miraculous comeback by scoring 16 points to tie Yale 29-29. The Crimson ran the story of the unlikely tie under the headline "Harvard Beats Yale 29-29."
The documentary proved to be an appropriate prelude to another exhilarating Harvard victory at The Game on Saturday.
"It’s not simply a sports film, but it is a good sports film," Jones said as he concluded. "I hope you all are able to go to the ballgame tomorrow."

The Harvard Arab Alumni Association presented a panel of speakers to discuss the “Global Economy” in the Middle East last Friday as part of the 4th Annual Harvard Arab Weekend.
The event was intended to “offer critical perspectives” on globalization and how it inhibits the political, social, and economic development of nations in the Middle East, according to Nimer Sultany, a student at Harvard Law School and one of the event organizers.
The event’s three panelists, after being introduced by Kennedy School Professor Dani Rodrik ’79, expressed some reservation about the potentially detrimental effects of globalization in the Middle East.
The panel was composed of Economics Professor Stephen A. Marglin ’59; Laura Nader, a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley; and Jonathan Nitzan, a professor of political economy at York University in Toronto.
The first to speak, Marglin, said that while he is not a regional expert, he took part in the panel to discuss how markets undermine community in all areas of the world. He said that achieving a better Middle East would require balancing the strength of community relationships with economic interests. He warned leaders to consider social effects when making choices about technology and industry.
Nitzan questioned the future of capitalism and explained that politics are inevitably linked to economics. According to Nitzan, the stability of a nation is largely based on its confidence in its economy.  “All rulers have fortune tellers and astrologers, even today,” he said, “We call them economists.”
Nader, speaking more specifically to the region, said she sees problems in globalization in the Middle East.
“It’s like No Child Left Behind,” she said, “It ruined us; it’s going to ruin the Middle East too.”  She went on to emphasize that what is appropriate in some areas of the world may not be in others, and that judgment should be used when deciding whether or not to embrace globalization.
The discussion concluded with questions from members of the audience, which consisted primarily of Harvard students, but also included people from other areas and universities, including students from as far away as Columbia University and Fairleigh Dickinson University in N.J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, queer issues at Harvard have become an institutional priority. But following a series of College-organized open forums and the creation of the BGLTQ Working Group in October to review resources for the LGBT community, students have voiced concerns that more University resources need to be devoted to LGBT support. 
The current Queer Resource Center—the only space on campus dedicated solely to LGBT issues—is closeted in the basement of Thayer and entirely run by students who work to maintain the cozy room decorated with various rainbows where people can meet, find movies and books, or stretch out on the couches between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays.
"The QRC is a universal place that’s not just for queer or queer-friendly people, but for everybody. But it differs from other lounge places in that it goes without saying that you can be open about your sexuality," says Felice S. Ford ’11, one of the QRC coordinators. "If you feel the need to hide elsewhere, you don’t have to here."
Yonatan J. Kogan ’12, another coordinator, says that for the students who work to ensure the continued availability of the QRC and the resources it provides, it can be difficult to negotiate the time spent running the QRC with other time commitments.
"It’s fantastic having a space where we can get together in the Yard, but the QRC isn’t everything it could be if it had funding, the support of full-time staff, and the full commitment of the University," he says. "Planning and resource acquisition and development shouldn’t all fall on students’ shoulders."
LACK OF CENTRALIZED RESOURCES
In addition to providing a welcoming and safe environment, the QRC offers safe sex supplies, candy, a meeting place for student groups after hours, a library full of advice books and LGBT literature, and a collection of DVDs. Three student coordinators and 11 volunteer staff members are responsible for the entire operation and maintenance of the QRC, which receives its funding from The Open Gate, a non-profit organization established by the LGBT alumni group, the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus.
QRC staffer Tevin L. Colbert ’14 says he was surprised to learn that the QRC receives no funding from the University, as many colleges have institutionally funded LGBT space and administrative support. Though he had expected Harvard to have more visible LGBT resources prior to coming, he says that he has been generally pleased with the atmosphere at the College.
"Harvard as a community has been really accepting—I feel almost like I could skip down the sidewalk waving a rainbow flag," he says, but adds that while he feels comfortable in the general environment of Harvard, locating specific information and resources can be a difficult task.
"My concern is for people who may need help and don’t know where to get it, for students who don’t know where to turn," he says. "You can find happiness and support, but you have to be willing to look for it."
AN IMPOSSIBLE BURDEN
 
 
 
Despite the dedication of the coordinators and staff, the fact that the QRC is entirely operated by students means that maintaining consistent personnel and institutional memory is a continuous struggle.
"If something is completely student-run you run the risk every year of losing the people who actually have the drive to keep it going," says Ford. "We’ve been lucky in the past, but that’s no indication of what’ll happen in the future."
Tom Bourdon, the current director of Tufts’ LGBT Center, emphasizes the importance of university support not only for LGBT space, but for full-time staff support as well. At Tufts, the LGBT Center was established in 1992, four years after the first staff coordinator to serve LGBT students was hired in 1988.
"Student groups often do great work, but if students are expected to fully and holistically take on all of those responsibilities, they are being asked to take on an overwhelming and impossible burden," he writes in an e-mail. He adds that official university support at Tufts enables not only physical space and staff, but can provide funding to allow for experts to be brought in and for students to attend conferences on LGBT issues.
Schools that have staffed LGBT centers, he writes, make a statement that "the university recognizes and respects the LGBT community, understands that there is professional-level work which needs to be done, and is proud to show their support."
CAMPUS COMMITMENTS TO DIVERSITY
According to Bourdon, there are currently about 150 institutions of higher education with professionally staffed LGBT centers. Many LGBT students and allies acutely feel the lack of this resource at Harvard.
"The space and organizations we have are great, but university support would be a very positive step in terms of highlighting Harvard’s commitment to diversity," says Jia Hui Lee ’12, a member of the Transgender Task Force who frequents the QRC, referring to the advantages other campus LBGT centers have.
"There’s a gap between the resources the QRC provides and the resources the College provides," he says, adding that because of this divide it can be difficult to find information about a range of LGBT issues.
As the director of LGBT Services at MIT, Abigail Francis staffs the Rainbow Lounge—the campus’ LGBT space—and works to ensure that everyone can access the resources they need.
"Students need to be students first and foremost," she says. "In terms of a comprehensive supportive approach to LGBT issues on campus, a staff member is really key to building community and cultivating leadership so students are empowered."
Joubert X. Glover, an MIT senior who is president of the MIT LGBT group G@MIT, says that the Rainbow Lounge has offered LGBT students a home away from home.
"I’m honored to say I go to MIT because of its ability to recognize diversity issues and help make sure we have spaces and resources," he says, adding that Francis helps students address difficult issues as they arise by being available to listen to concerns and offer advice and information. "Just looking at the suicides on high school and college campuses, it’s clear that there is a need for some sort of support, and I’m glad MIT sees the need for that."
AN OVERFLOWING NEED
Kogan says that while he enjoys having a space that gives students a sense of ownership as well as a place to hang out, the LGBT community is taking a stand to get more resources from Harvard.
"The QRC is a well utilized space, and that speaks to fact that this is something that there’s a demand for on campus," he says. "Still, there’s not that much visibility on campus which can be frustrating, and that’s something we’re trying to work on."
As part of this push for visibility, members of the Harvard LGBT community will be gathering on the Science Center lawn at noon today to demonstrate the need for more LGBT resources by cramming into an exact outline of the QRC. By overflowing the only space on campus specifically dedicated to LGBT issues, the event announcement states, "we want to convey the need for the improvement of Queer resources on campus."
Ford says that she hopes this action, as well as the outcome of the BGLTQ Working Group, will lead to better allocations for the LGBT community for future students.
"We can only do so much in our hours of 11 to five, and in the end, that’s not enough," she says. "As far as specific queer resources and support go, we are it."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Yale tailgate could be heard from across the river as thousands of students joined in the revelry outside Harvard Stadium. Tailgaters encountered a flurry of activity, including cheering crowds, students playing banned vuvuzelas, and packed food tents.
But the pre-game event drew mixed reactions from students as many reflected on the changing nature of the festivities.
Organizing the tailgates were Harvard House Committees, the Yale College Council, and social organizations.
The HoCo tailgates drew large crowds and boasted attractions such as Eliot’s face painting station and Mather’s “Crunk Time” clock.
“It was sort of great to get the Houses together in one place,” said Michael K. Oberst ’12, Lowell HoCo’s merchandise manager. “I would say that every House has something going for it.”
In addition to the Crunk Clock, Mather once again unfurled its highrise tower. Pforzheimer’s polar bear mascot danced as HoCo members and House tutors served chili. While Leverett offered apple cider and champagne, Currier’s theme was “come get some wine and beer.”
HoCos sought to “keep the energy up while staying within the rules,” said Allison L. Sikora ’11, Leverett House Committee co-chair.
Many HoCos organizers expressed frustrations with this year’s event regulations.
“One restriction that I thought was particularly over the top was having no kegs. We were allowed to serve beer, which was fine, but we were only allowed to serve it in cans,” Oberst said. “It’s not very green.”
What many students perceive as more stringent tailgate regulations result from a 2006 decision by the Boston Police department to bring enforcement of rules at The Game in line with other area sporting events. Many attribute this to numerous hospitalizations and alcohol-related violations at the 2004 home event.
“It was the Boston police who were basically running the show,” Oberst said.
Cara M. Sprague ’11 of the Pfoho HoCo humorously described Boston as a “Puritan area,” but recalled the safety concerns that gave raise to today’s stricter rules. “We deal with what we have,” Sprague said.
Yale’s tailgate drew a different, but related, set of criticisms. Common complaints included limited space, need for 21+ bracelets to drink, lack of beer, and time constraints.
“I did tailgate last year at Yale—it was so much better. Things got rowdy and we had U-Hauls and free-flowing beer. Harvard ran out of beer,” said a junior from Yale, who declined to give a name.
“It’s so crowded I got lost in there,” said Chelsea S. Link ’12, describing Yale’s tailgate at the Harvard game as less organized than the Harvard side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life has forbidden students in upperclassmen Houses from hosting overnight guests they meet through the online hospitality exchange network CouchSurfing.org, Mather House Master Michael D. Rosengarten and Adams House Master John G. "Sean" Palfrey ’67 confirmed yesterday.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson was not available for comment.
Couchsurfing is a term that refers to the practice of utilizing a large network of participating hosts and travelers to find places to stay while traveling. CouchSurfing.org, the website behind the phenomenon, connects travelers with hosts willing to offer up their couches for one or more nights.
An e-mail sent Friday to all Mather House residents stated that "inviting guests whom you meet through ‘couchsurfing.org’ is not permitted." According to Rosengarten, these restrictions apply to all upperclassmen Houses.
According to Palfrey, although students in Harvard Houses are forbidden from hosting couchsurfers, they are still allowed to use the website, and as a result are still allowed to find hosts and connect with other couchsurfers in their area to share their couchsurfing experiences.
Freshman proctor Jason L. Outlaw said that freshman dorm proctors have not been made aware of similar policies in the freshman dormitories.
Since its founding in 2004, CouchSurfing.org has attracted over two million members and has facilitated over 2.5 million "successful surf or host experiences," according to its website.
Several Harvard-specific groups are registered on Couchsurfing.org with a stated mission of connecting current Harvard students, alumni, and affiliates. The two largest Harvard groups currently hold 94 and 44 members each. However, the total number of Harvard students who use Couchsurfing.org to find and offer temporary hosting may be much greater, as many students who currently use the service opt not to join a particular group.
Rosengarten’s e-mail to Mather residents warned that "meeting and hosting guests" through couchsurfing "could compromise the safety of House residents." Although CouchSurfing.org assures on its website that it provides "a safer way to meet people than you might think," isolated incidents still occur. The website’s message boards include many individual accounts of alleged assault. In 2009, the rape of a Hong Kong couchsurfer by her host in England made headlines.
Rebecca H. Kwan ’14, who has used CouchSurfing.org to both host and find a place to stay, said that although she understood the concerns of Harvard administrators, she considered use of the service "all right as long as your dormmates or your roommates are OK with it."
Kwan, who hosted a female couchsurfer from Israel in her Matthews dorm room earlier this semester, said she chose to volunteer her couch as a way to give back to the couchsurfing community, which helped her find a place to stay when she was traveling abroad.
"I [couch]surfed when I needed a place to stay in Australia," Kwan said. "I think it’s a really good experience. The people you meet when hosting are amazing and their experiences are so incredible."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 will return to the Law School this January after serving in the Department of Justice for nine months as senior counselor for the Access to Justice Initiative.
Tribe is leaving the Department of Justice because he has experienced recurring facial seizures and other symptoms of a benign brain tumor, which was diagnosed in 2008, according to a Law School press release.
In returning to the Law School, Tribe will be closer to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he will undergo treatment.
Though Tribe will return to the Law School faculty in January, he will not teach until the 2011-2012 school year.
“His inspired work promoting access to justice has opened new approaches that will continue long after he returns to Harvard—and we are so grateful for his public service even as we are eager to welcome him back here,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in the press release.
Tribe has spearheaded the launch of the Justice Department’s new Access to Justice Initiative, a program that seeks to improve access to legal services for the poor and middle class.
In this post, Tribe has served as the primary liaison to the federal and state judiciary, and has traveled across the country to work with judges and attorneys to improve the delivery of legal services.
“With his trademark brilliant advocacy and penetrating insight, Larry Tribe brought national focus to the crisis of access to justice in our courts,” said Margaret H. Marshall, Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in a press release.
“The principle of equal justice for all has had no greater champion in our time. We are delighted to welcome Larry home to Massachusetts and look forward to continuing to work with him here,” Marshall said.
On Nov. 19, Tribe presented several new initiatives with Vice President Joe Biden at a Middle Class Task Force event at the White House. The new programs included a revamped foreclosure mediation approach, steps to help veterans access legal services, and improved legal support for workers.
Tribe worked with the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to shape these new initiatives.
“Many people’s lives can be improved without major new investments, and in fact with real savings, if we simply help them access the legal rights and benefits that are theirs,” Tribe said at the event.
According to the New York Times, Tribe said he has been open about his medical situation to avoid speculation that his departure from the Justice Department was related to the leak last month of a letter written to President Obama in May 2009 which criticized Sonia Sotomayor as a potential Supreme Court nominee.
The Department of Justice will continue its Access to Justice Initiative, but it is unclear whether a successor to Tribe will be selected to lead the effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, the Harvard women’s hockey team rode two first-career goals from freshmen to gain both a crucial conference victory and a win over the ninth-ranked team in the nation when it defeated Dartmouth, 5-3.
The Crimson came out strong and took the first goal when rookie defender Marissa Gedman received a pass from fellow freshman Kalley Armstrong. Gedman took a slap shot that found the back of the net after hitting the post to score her first career goal just under eight minutes into the game. During the first period, Harvard outshot the Big Green, 10-6.
“That’s what our game plan was, to get all over them and not give them time or space to do anything,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “And I think that we executed that plan pretty well.”
The Crimson lost that advantage as the game progressed, as Dartmouth came back from the break with renewed intensity. The Big Green outshot Harvard in the second period, 11-5. Junior Jenna Hobeika evened the score on a power play in the second minute of the period with assists from sophomore Margaux Sharp and freshman Lauren Kelly.
Dartmouth also had the advantage in power plays during the second period, as the Crimson ran into its first bout of penalty trouble. During the 11th minute of the frame, sophomore defender Josephine Pucci was called for holding and was quickly followed to the penalty box by classmate Hilary Hayssen for delaying the game. During this time, Dartmouth had a chance to exploit the five-on-three advantage, but the Crimson managed to stop the Big Green from scoring. Freshman Lauren Joarnt made 20 saves through the game.
“[Joarnt] did well,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She played well. She’s a little kid with a big heart. She did a good job for us tonight.”
The Crimson managed to gain enough momentum, despite the challenges of the period, to score two goals in the last two minutes of the frame. The first was scored by tri-captain Liza Ryabkina with assists from Buesser and senior Katharine Chute. After receiving the pass from Buesser, Ryabkina fired a slap shot from the right side of the ice and into the far left side of the goal.
Freshman Elizabeth Parker followed suit less than a minute later, assisted by classmates Gedman and Lyndsey Fry. From the Crimson’s defensive zone, Gedman and Fry played the puck behind the goal to an open patch of ice. Parker gained a break down the left side, charging at the goalie and letting a shot off close to the net.
“I think that a lot of that momentum came from our penalty killing,” Buesser said. “There was a five-on-three and a couple five-on-fours, and that’s huge. If you don’t let a goal in and you can just turn around and pop a few in yourself, that gives the team a huge push.”
The second period came to a close with Harvard holding a comfortable lead, and Buesser extended the advantage with a shorthanded goal six minutes into the third. When Buesser fired the shot, it appeared as though goalie Whitney Woodcox had made the save, but the puck bounced over her head and into the net.
The Big Green almost tied the score in the final minutes of the third period. With less than three minutes to go, the Crimson was down a player when officials penalized Ryabkina for diving. Dartmouth capitalized on the power-play opportunity when sophomore Sasha Nanji tipped in a shot from Hobeika that came from the far right.
With the momentum from a goal still energizing the Big Green, junior Geneva Kliman took a shot from just beyond the blue line that got by Joarnt and pulled Dartmouth within a point.
“I think that we didn’t need to have it be that tight in the end,” Stone said. “We had given ourselves a nice gap there and got in a little penalty trouble. And you can’t do that against a good team like Dartmouth. Dartmouth’s done a really good job of coming back when they’ve been down.”
With the opportunity to tie the game in sight and less than a minute to play, Dartmouth pulled its goalie in exchange for an extra skater. But the Big Green was unable to score the goal it hoped for, and, with less than 10 seconds to go, Chute gained control of the puck and carried it down the ice to tally an empty-net goal for the Crimson.
“We knew that this was a good team. They’re ranked ninth in the country right now, and we knew they weren’t going away at all,” Buesser said. “They showed that, and they fought right until the very end. But I think that we were able to stand up to it and absorb what they were doing, and it turned out well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Historically, being the underdog is not a familiar situation for the Harvard women’s hockey team. But the Crimson (4-2-2, 4-2-2 ECAC) thrived in the role this weekend, coming back to beat No. 9 Dartmouth (6-3-0, 5-3-0), 3-2, on Saturday afternoon at Thompson Arena.
It was Harvard’s second win over the Big Green in as many days and brought the team a much-needed weekend sweep.
“We were all just extremely excited and happy to finally...get four points in a weekend, because we had been struggling in the past six games,” sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey said. “To come out hard and successful against Dartmouth, I think that really helped us with our confidence and let us know what we have to bring to every game.”
Dempsey played the hero on Saturday afternoon, scoring the game-winning goal with just over two minutes to play.
The sophomore took a pass from tri-captain Leanna Coskren and quickly flipped it past Big Green goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft for the go-ahead score.
“It was great hard work from everyone out there,” Dempsey said of the goal, which was her second of the afternoon. “Leanna, it was an unbelievable pass as always...it was just a little bit of open space, and I just cut down and she saw me.”
Though Dartmouth pulled Holdcroft with just over a minute to go, sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy stood tall to hold on for her third win of the season.
“She had some unbelievable saves,” Dempsey said of her classmate, who recorded 28 stops after yielding to freshman Lauren Joarnt in the last two games. “There were some times when had she not come up with the save, we probably would have been in trouble with momentum. She proved herself in net and showed us that she can make the really big saves in the real crucial moments.”
But long before Dempsey’s game-winner, it was Dartmouth that struck first.
Although both teams struggled to generate shots in the opening period—the Big Green outshot Harvard, 8-5, in the frame—Dartmouth capitalized on one of its few early opportunities.
Just under 12 minutes into the game, Big Green junior Moira Scanlon took a pass from Lauren Kelly and got the puck past Bellamy, putting her team up, 1-0.
The Crimson responded seven minutes into the second period, with Dempsey evening the game on a shorthanded tally. She took a pass from tri-captain Kate Buesser and powered it past Holdcroft despite the man disadvantage.
It was a bright moment for the Harvard penalty-kill unit, which has struggled to a nation-worst .697 kill percentage this season but has scored shorthanded in each of its last two games.
“We’re playing a physical type of style this year, and we’re in the penalty box here and there, but it’s definitely good to see our systems working out right now,” Buesser said. “The two goals on the penalty kill are kind of a bonus.”
But the penalty-kill woes resurfaced later that period when freshman Marissa Gedman was sent to the box for hooking. Near the end of her team’s power play, Dartmouth sophomore Kelly Foley capitalized on the man advantage to put the Big Green ahead, 2-1.
“Normally our penalty kill is doing much better in that we don’t usually give up as many [goals] as we’ve given up to this point,” Dempsey said. “It’s a work in progress. We’re seeing what works and what doesn’t.”
Despite facing a one-goal deficit at the second intermission, Harvard came out to start the third period with intensity.
“It’s just the mentality that we’re never out of a game,” Buesser said. “We’ve definitely been coming from behind in a lot of our games, so the group of players that we have, we never say we’re out of it.”
Junior Alisa Baumgartner knotted the score at two 3:20 into the third, finishing off a feed from senior Ashley Wheeler for her first goal of the season.
Though the Crimson was outshot, 7-5, in the third period, it played the Big Green evenly until Dempsey netted the game-winner late in the frame. Dartmouth outshot Harvard, 30-17, for the contest.
With the victory, the Crimson has put together its first winning streak of the season and stands tied for second place in the conference standings with its rival Big Green.
“There is that big rivalry between us and Dartmouth,” Dempsey said. “It worked out really nicely that we a) got the two wins, b) that it was against Dartmouth, and c) that it was against a team that had been doing really well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team played two completely different games this weekend.
On Friday night at Princeton, assistant captain goaltender Kyle Richter only allowed one goal—often sufficient for a win.
On Saturday at Quinnipiac, the team tallied four scores, also normally boding well for victory.
But unfortunately for the Crimson (2-4-2, 2-4-2 ECAC), neither effort was enough, as the team lost the two contests by one goal each—mustering neither enough offense against the Tigers (4-4-0, 4-2-0) nor enough defense versus the Bobcats (7-4-1, 3-2-1) to pick up a conference win.
“Anytime you lose a game by a goal  it’s tough, but from Friday to Saturday night was a pretty big transition,” sophomore Connor Morrison said. “Friday night was a big defensive battle; Saturday night turned into a run-and-gun game.”
QUINNIPIAC 5, HARVARD 4
After excellent goalie play on both sides Friday, Saturday night’s contest was a completely different story.
Despite scoring three times in just over four minutes late in the second period, the Crimson could not contain a high-powered Bobcat offense at TD Bank Sports Center and suffered its third consecutive loss.
Quinnipiac got on the board first when John Dunbar deflected a shot past Richter at 10:21 in the opening period on a power play. Harvard had entered the game as the nation’s best penalty-killing squad statistically.
Yuri Bouharevich put the Bobcats up, 2-0, just 40 seconds later, taking a pass after flying down the half boards and firing the puck off a Crimson defender and into the goal.
“In both games, I think we hit a little lull within the game, and I think our intensity level dropped for short periods of time,” Morrison said. “In this league, you have to play hard for 60 minutes, and we didn’t do that.”
But Harvard roared back to pull within one late in the period. After sophomore Marshall Everson was denied on a rebound attempt off a shot by sophomore Danny Biega, Morrison came in from the right to put Everson’s rebound away and make the score 2-1.
After Quinnipiac scored twice more—on a one-timer by Ben Arnt and a goal by Kellen Jones, who took a through-the-legs pass from brother Connor before firing on net—the Crimson fought back to tie things up.
Junior Colin Moore made it 4-2 when he put back a rebound of a shot by co-captain Michael Del Mauro, and a shorthanded goal from junior Rence Coassin pulled the Crimson within one.
“I think we stuck to the simple things [Saturday],” Morrison said. “We started getting pucks to the net...when you do that, bounces are going to go your way. Friday night, we weren’t necessarily getting bounces, guys weren’t in the right places.”
With just 14.6 seconds remaining in the second period, junior Alex Killorn tied things up, beating Bobcat netminder Eric Hartzell from the left side.
But in the third, Arnt scored his second goal of the evening with 5:12 remaining, firing a one-timer past senior goalie Ryan Carroll—who replaced Richter after Quinnipiac’s third goal—to provide the dagger.
Hartzell made a huge save in the final minute, reaching back over his left leg to make a glove stop on Everson and give his team the win.
“It’s tough,” Morrison said. “I think the guys are a little down, but there’s definitely a lot of positives to take out of the weekend. We were only a couple shots away from winning those games.”
PRINCETON 1, HARVARD 0
In a rematch of the first round of last season’s ECAC playoffs—when the Crimson swept its conference rivals—the Tigers got a measure of revenge with a shutout victory on Friday at Hobey Baker Rink.
Harvard came out on the attack, firing six shots during a power play early in the first period. But Princeton goalie Mike Condon saved each attempt, denying Crimson forward Killorn on a shot from the right side and making a diving stick save on the junior’s rebound attempt.
The Tigers then got on the board midway through the period, when Mike Kramer took a pass across the zone from teammate Kevin Ross and fired a shot from the left faceoff circle, beating Richter.
It was all Princeton would need the rest of the way, thanks to the phenomenal play of Condon.
In the second period, the sophomore stopped Coassin on a one-on-one and made a save on a deflection right in front of the goal by junior Daniel Moriarty.
The Crimson outshot the Tigers in the third period, but Condon made a stick save on a Killorn attempt and later survived a chance by Harvard senior Matt McCollem, whose backhanded shot on net was ruled no goal after it flickered in the air above the goal line.
“[Condon] played well,” Everson said. “I just thought we didn’t do a good enough job right away of getting to the net. We had our shots, but didn’t get the rebounds. I felt the bounces didn’t go our way.”
With four minutes remaining, the Crimson had its best opportunity to tie the game. But after a string of Harvard chances, Princeton forward Brodie Zuk made a diving save at the goal line to kick away senior Michael Biega’s shot from the right side and preserve the Tiger shutout.
Killorn led the team with six shots, while Richter made 34 saves in defeat.
“[Richter] was unbelievable,” Everson said. “Just as he’s been all season for us.”

Sometimes you have to play the best to be the best.
Harvard wrestling hopes it can get there, but for now there is still a steep hill to climb. The Crimson (0-3) traveled to Binghamton, N.Y. yesterday for the Journeyman Sprawl & Brawl, a dual tournament featuring some of the country’s top teams. Harvard dropped its matches to No. 6 Penn State (5-0), Michigan State (3-0), and Eastern Michigan, and even though the squad vastly improved throughout the day, Crimson coach Jay Weiss said he saw room to get better.
“Obviously, we scheduled high, and we do that to get our guys to stretch themselves and see where they need to be,” Weiss said. “We said, ‘Let’s go after it, and hopefully you guys can wrestle hard.’ But that didn’t happen in the first match. We just didn’t wrestle well top to bottom.”
Harvard opened the day with a 45-0 loss to Penn State, but followed up with a pair of individual wins in a 31-10 loss to Michigan State, and nearly topped Eastern Michigan in a 24-22 defeat.
“I thought we did better as we went through,” Weiss said. “Some indivduals did well and some didn’t, and we’ll be able to go back and really focus on one of our biggest tournaments coming up in Vegas [in two weeks].”
EASTERN MICHIGAN 24, HARVARD 22
The Crimson nearly closed out its day with a victory, splitting its 10 bouts evenly with Eastern Michigan. But the Eagles won all five of their matches by bonus points, marking the difference in an otherwise even match.
“We lost by two points, and we could have found two points somewhere in that match,” Weiss said. “You’ve got to win those bouts and have everybody step up.”
The matchup started promisingly enough for Harvard, which enjoyed a 6-0 lead after a forfeit at 125 pounds. But sophomore Steven Keith, who moved up a weight class to 133, could not keep pace with his larger opponent, dropping a major decision, 14-6.
Harvard’s middle weights, traditionally a strength, proved dominant against the Eagles, as junior Corey Jantzen, junior co-captain Walter Peppelman, and sophomore Adam Hogue reeled off three straight victories to put the Crimson up, 18-8.
Jantzen in particular earned praise from his coach for recovering after a tough opening bout.
“The big thing for Corey is that he had to get better at bouncing back, and he sure did [yesterday],” Weiss said. “He didn’t feel great physically today, but he bounced back in his second and third matches, and to me that’s a huge milestone.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, the gutsy effort would not prove good enough. After the teams traded major decisions at 174 and 184—with rookie Cameron Croy getting his first collegiate dual win in the latter—the Eagles rode a fall at 197 and a forfeit at heavyweight to the narrow victory.
MICHIGAN STATE 31, HARVARD 10
In the middle of three matches with no break in between, the Crimson could have easily wilted against the Spartans. Instead, Harvard hung in against the Big 10 squad, notching a trio of victories to keep the bout close early on.
Keith earned his lone win of the day with a 5-2 decision over Eric Olanowski, and No. 9 Jantzen followed at 149 with an 11-2 bonus-point victory.
Jantzen’s solid performance paved the way for classmate Peppelman (157), who notched the marquee win of the day by topping 14th-ranked David Cheza, 3-0. Peppelman earned points early from the top position and played solid defense to shut out his opponent.
“[Peppelman] controlled the pace,” Weiss said. “Once you have that lead you can wrestle a different match, and he stayed in position and just looked for the other guy’s mistakes.”
Still, the co-captain felt he had a ways to go before reaching his potential.
“I thought I wrestled hard, and obviously I was happy that I won...but I would have liked to wrestle better,” Peppelman said.
So too would the rest of the team against the Spartans. Harvard dropped its remaining four bouts and ceded the heavyweight forfeit, turning a close match into a 21-point loss.
NO. 6 PENN STATE 45, HARVARD 0
The Crimson opened the day with a difficult task, challenging the sixth-ranked Nittany Lions. Although Weiss did not expect Harvard to keep pace with a Penn State squad boasting six grapplers in the top 15, the coach showed disappointment in his team’s lack of discipline.
“I think what’s upsetting is we focus and put a game plan in, and then we watch and it’s not even being played [out],” Weiss said of the first match.
Penn State cruised through the 10-bout slate, with only Jantzen and Hogue staying within three points of their respective opponents. Perhaps the toughest assignment of the day, though, came for junior Bryan Panzano, who moved up two weight classes to 197. The third-year wrestler went 0-3 on the day as he continues to adjust to a new position.
“Bryan Panzano was our unsung hero,” Peppelman said. “We had a 197-pounder leave the team, and [Panzano] was at 174, so he’s still underweight. His effort was phenomenal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) opened its 2010-11 season this weekend in dominating fashion, hosting No. 10 Brown (1-1, 0-1) on Friday and both No. 6 Stanford (2-2) and No. 9 Williams (0-2) on Sunday. The Crimson, ranked first in the nation, defeated the Bears, 9-0, on Friday, and both the Cardinal and the Ephs, 9-0, on Sunday.
Last year, Harvard earned a perfect 12-0 record en route to a national title. During the season, the Crimson beat the Bears, 9-0, to open the year, and they also topped Williams twice by the same margin. Stanford fell to Harvard as well last year by a score of 8-1.
This season, the top athletes from last year’s Crimson rotation have returned, including sophomore and current individual national champion Laura Gemmell. The crew’s depth, then, should provide a valuable advantage as Harvard takes on higher-ranked squads.
The weekend’s games were also the first for new Crimson coach Mike Way as he steps in at the helm of the program this year. Way already possesses a strong relationship with Gemmell from their collaboration in the Canadian national circuits.
“[Way] has been my coach since I was 10 years old,” Gemmell explained.
HARVARD 9, WILLIAMS 0
Harvard blanked the Ephs without dropping a single game to end the team’s first weekend of competition.
“Williams gave us a good match,” sophomore Natasha Kingshott said. “They have a much larger team so we were able to play more matches than we usually do. It’s a great way to give the bottom of our lineup match experience. It also gets the freshmen involved and helps them to ease their college match jitters. I’m really proud of the freshmen—I think they did a great job.”
Williams’ efforts were not enough in the face of a strong Crimson performance. Playing consecutive matches in the same day also proved to have no effect on Harvard as it pushed the Ephs aside to earn its third victory of the year.
Although every Crimson athlete swept her match in straight sets, sophomore Sarah Mumanachit performed especially well, defeating Hanna Kaemmer by scores of 11-1, 11-1, and 11-2 at the No. 4 position. Freshman Natasha Anzik also had a nice day in the No. 9 slot for Harvard, battling her way to 11-2, 11-5, and 11-5 victories.
HARVARD 9, STANFORD 0
On the way to its second victory of the young season on Sunday morning, the Crimson moved past the Cardinal with ease.
“It’s always exciting to play Stanford,” Kingshott said. “They bring an awesome spirit. They came out strong. We knew they were going to be a force to deal with, but I think we handled the pressure well. Since we had so many matches, this weekend was about recovery and taking care of ourselves. Both mentally and physically, we were very strong.”
Harvard also enjoyed the home-field advantage, avoiding the long trek across country to play Stanford.
“In the past, we’ve flown to Stanford, so it was nice to have them come out and play us,” Gemmell said.
Six of the nine Crimson players won their matches 3-0. Junior Cece Cortes defeated Leah Stork 11-5, 11-3, and 11-3 in the No. 7 spot, and sophomore Vidya Rajan held her own at the No. 8 position with a 3-0 victory in her match as well.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
Harvard dispensed Brown easily on Friday evening as all nine women won their matches. The Crimson’s top three players—No. 1 Gemmell, No. 2 junior Nirasha Gurgue, and No. 3 captain Alisha Mashruwala—did not drop a game in their matches, and eight of the nine players won their matches in straight sets.
Kingshott also proved dominant in the No. 5 slot for the Crimson, defeating Sophie Scherl in straight games by scores of 11-1, 11-3, and 11-2.
“We played really well against Brown and only dropped a couple games in a couple matches,” Gemmell said. “Everyone was happy with her performance this weekend.”
Kingshott shared her teammate’s sentiment.
“We always play Brown as our season opener,” Kingshott said. “We got the ball flowing and our momentum going for the rest of the year.”
The weekend’s results also bode well for a squad looking to hold onto its national title. So far, Harvard is mirroring its championship-winning performance last year in which it blanked its first four opponents.
“A national title is within our grasp,” Kingshott said. “We are going to pursue that goal with as much intensity and determination as any other year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the second event of the meet, there never seemed to be a question that the men’s swimming and diving team would cruise to victory against Columbia.
Although Harvard (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) was behind by five points going into the second event, the Crimson dominated the rest of the meet. Once Harvard gained the lead, the squad never lost it. The team sealed the decisive victory, 196-102, on Friday at Blodgett Pool.
“We performed very well as a team,” co-captain Douwe Yntema said. “All of our swimmers were very competitive and finished their races in strong form. We expected it to be a lot closer than it was, but in any close race, it seemed the Harvard swimmers would end up winning.”
In the second event of the meet, the Crimson took three of the top four spots in the 1,650-yard freestyle to lead the Lions by six points. Freshman Wes Stearns got off to an early lead and finished in first with a time of 15:52.83. The battle for third was much closer. Sophomore Matthew Kaminske closed the gap on the last few laps, but senior Blake Lewkowitz managed to maintain his lead and finished in 16:16.07.
Harvard pulled out even further ahead of Columbia after a string of victories in the next few events. In the 200-yard freestyle, the Crimson nabbed the top three spots, but there was a battle for first that came down to the last lap. Sophomore Greg Roop started out front in the beginning, but freshmen Chris Satterthwaite and Spenser Goodman passed him at the end to take first and second, respectively.
Two events later, sophomore Owen Wurzbacher, freshman Jason Ting, and co-captain Justin Davidson finished 1-2-3 in the 100-yard breaststroke. Wurzbacher earned the Crimson nine points for his victory, putting Harvard far out in front, 64-29.
“To go 1-2-3 in any event is a huge thing, especially in a league as competitive as this one,” Davidson said. “I think it bodes well for the breaststroke events this season.”
In the 200-yard butterfly, Columbia junior Bruno Esquen came flying off of the starting block in first, but this race demonstrated that strategy trumps early leads. Junior Niall Janney appeared to be far behind Esquen, but turned it into a higher gear in the middle of the race to finish two seconds ahead of his competitor. Yntema almost managed to steal second, gaining on Esquen during the last few lengths, but couldn’t quite close the gap before touching the wall.
“It was a close race, and I was hoping to catch him at the end, but I didn’t,” Yntema said. “I was trying my hardest to go 1-2 in that race.”
But it was the middle of the meet that sealed the victory and took away any hope of victory from the Lions. Harvard grabbed the top three spots in the 200-yard backstroke and then took four of the five top positions in the 200-yard breaststroke, picking up 33 points in those two events alone.
The top three finishers in the 200-yard backstroke pulled out ahead early and never looked back. Freshman Jack Pretto earned victory in the event, with junior David Lynch and senior Michael Dunn rounding out the top three.
In the 200-yard breaststroke, Wurzbacher grabbed first for the second time in the meet. Ting and Davidson completed the race right behind their teammate. Columbia freshman Eric Traub stole a perfect race from the Crimson on the last lap, finishing in 2:10.34, narrowly beating freshman Danny Crigler’s time of 2:10.41.
Even though most of the points came from the swimming events, the Crimson divers significantly helped out the team. In both the one-meter and three-meter diving events, senior Zac Ranta, sophomore Michael Stanton, and freshman Joe Zarrella took the top three positions after six dives, earning 32 points in both events, while the Lions only managed to gain six points. Stanton won the three-meter event, while Zarrella took the one-meter title.
With this week’s victory and two equally dominant wins over Cornell and Dartmouth last weekend, Harvard has clearly established itself as one of the top dogs in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first weekend of regular season play, the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team looked to be in peak form, as the Crimson earned victories at home over No. 14 Brown and No. 11 Williams.
“We want to just keep the momentum [we gained this weekend],” captain J. Reed Endresen said. “It was great for our team to take these two victories and beat some decently good teams.”
HARVARD 8, WILLIAMS 1
The Crimson (2-0) proved to be up to its second regular-season test yesterday afternoon, as Harvard handed the Ephs (1-1) their first loss. Building upon momentum established during Friday night’s blowout victory over the Bears (1-1), Harvard outplayed its opponent for the second straight game.
“[Williams] was a stronger challenge [than our first],” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “But...I think we’ll have a clearer picture of how good we are after the Cornell-Rochester trip, because both are games away from home.”
Against the Ephs, freshman standout Gary Power led the way, using his flair and quickness to defeat Williams’ top player, junior William Morris, in three sets. Senior Richard Hill also won in three sets for the second straight time at No. 2.
Freshman Brandon McLaughlin and sophomore Zeke Scherl both outlasted their opponents, winning three straight games despite each dropping their first set of the day. Scherl ended his four-game match with a dominant 11-1 win in the last frame.
Though Harvard sealed its victory after the fifth individual matchup, the Ephs did not go down without a fight. In front of a large crowd due to the fact that all other matches had finished, Williams’ Julian Drobetsky defeated Crimson sophomore Alexander Ma in a heated, action-packed contest at the No. 7 spot to earn the Ephs’ lone individual victory of the day.
“We did have some close matches [this weekend], even though the scores were 9-0 and 8-1,” Way said. “Of course, it just shows you how tense these matches can be.”
Though the matchups were tighter than indicated by the score, Harvard’s freshman class had a strong showing on Sunday, providing immediate contributions on the court to aid a young Harvard team to victory.
“We have a bunch of freshman in the top of the lineup, so it was great to see them perform,” Endresen said. “Today, it was tough after Harvard-Yale, but it was great to see everyone come out and play so well.”
According to Way, the matches this weekend have even greater value than just a pair of tallies in the team’s win column.
“What this weekend gives me is an opportunity to see [the players] under pressure,” Way said. “Where are their heads? Are they executing their game plan? How are they holding it together, and are they adjusting tactically how they need to as the match progresses?”
“From my perspective, I need to see them play these matches so I can then really build the program around what I see out there,” Way added.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
On Friday, in the Crimson’s first game of the weekend, Harvard tore through the Bears’ lineup without dropping a single game, as each player on the Crimson ladder earned a 3-0 victory.
The match was once again decided early on, with freshman Thomas Mullaney notching the team’s fifth win at the No. 9 spot to secure the overall victory for Harvard.
Making his debut in a Crimson jersey, Power won his first college match against Brown’s Brad Thompson at the No. 1 spot.
Also playing in their first collegiate squash contests, McLaughlin and classmate Nigel Koh similarly dismantled their opponents at the No. 2 and No. 4 spots, respectively.
The veterans on the team, led by Endresen, also contributed to the first of two dominant victories for the Crimson.
“Coach has really been focusing on the individual and how they can add to the team as a whole,” Endresen said. “Everyone brings a lot of energy to this team, and this has really been a good aspect of practice [and matches].”
Though Harvard currently sits undefeated in regular-season play, the Crimson still has a long way to go if it hopes to achieve its season goals.
“I did see every player at least playing with the intention of making the changes [we’ve been working on] to their game, but there’s work to be done,” Way said. “Every coach is going to tell you no matter what their win-loss record is, there’s always work to be done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard-Yale tailgates got most students out of bed on a Saturday morning before 10 a.m. for the first time all fall this weekend, the Harvard men’s crews were already racing through the powerhouse stretch, bringing their fall season to a close with several victories at the Tail of the Charles.
The heavyweight squad hosted traditional Charles River rivals Boston University and Northeastern and also welcomed Brown, Dartmouth, Syracuse, MIT, and UMass, among other teams.
The men’s lightweight squad was the only lightweight team to participate in Saturday’s racing, although three MIT freshman eights joined the freshman eight event. All crews raced in fours with the exception of the freshman event, for which all boats were eights.
The Crimson heavyweights came away victorious in every event they raced on Saturday, adding to what has been a very successful fall season that began with top finishes at the Head of the Charles.
On Saturday, each four defeated its respective competition, and some knocked off higher-seeded boats as well, such as Harvard’s B four that finished in front of all A boat entries.
“We were really pleased with the performance,” heavyweight captain Anthony Locke said. “I think that as a team we had some really telling results. We beat Brown pretty much across the board. And, of course, the varsity fours performed great. I think it’s just a case of our hard training this fall allowing us to get into fours and make them go fast.”
The Crimson’s A and B fours finished first and second with times of 12:46.4—a course record—and 13:00.5, respectively. Syracuse A was a close third in 13:00.9, and BU claimed fourth in 13:07.7. Harvard C took fifth in 13:08.4, beating out Brown A, which took sixth in 13:09.2.
Harvard’s A four was composed of sophomore coxswain David Fuller, sophomore stroke James O’Connor, junior three seat Sam O’Connor, junior two seat Mike DiSanto, and sophomore bow seat Josh Hicks.
The Crimson also won the freshman eight event in a time of 12:08.2. The top heavyweight boat edged out second-place Boston University that finished in 12:11.2 and crossed the line nearly 24 seconds ahead of third-place Brown.
“Coming off of the fall, I think we are in a pretty good position,” Locke said. “We just need to keep pushing on. We can definitely gain some momentum with training through the winter and hopefully carry that into the spring.”
The Crimson lightweight fours had a strong performance against a field of heavyweights. Rowing tends to be a sport where mass moves boats, but lightweight rowing defies that perception. And on Saturday, the Harvard lightweights proved that size is not everything in this sport.
“[The Tail of the Charles] is always a tough race, because we’re racing against heavyweights,” captain Will Newell said. “It’s really the toughest competition we face out of the whole year. And I think overall the team did well.”
The lightweight A boat took seventh place, crossing the line just behind Brown’s A four in 13:15.1. The B four beat out much of the heavyweight field as well, finishing 12th in 13:31.2, just behind Northeastern’s A four.
The Crimson A four was the same line-up that claimed first at the Princeton Chase just a few weeks ago. It was composed of junior coxswain Angela Chang, sophomore stroke Matt O’Leary, junior three seat Tom Nesel, senior two seat Newell, and sophomore bow seat Erich Schultze.
In the freshman eight event, the Harvard lightweights entered three eights and one in combination with the heavyweight squad. The top lightweight boat took fifth, defeating many heavyweight boats as well as the top MIT lightweight eight, which took eighth overall.
“We have a really, really strong sophomore and junior class, as well as some good looking freshmen, and these results just show the depth of our squad,” Newell said.
Like the heavyweight team, the lightweights wrapped up fall competition with racing at the Tail. And, while the team’s fall results—particularly this past weekend’s strong showing against heavyweight opponents—position them well at this point in the year, they are eager to see where they can be this spring after a winter of indoor training.
“The biggest thing going into this winter is just going to be having the opportunity to work incredibly hard,” Newell said. “We will come out of winter training a lot stronger, a lot more fit, and just ready to race in the spring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale wasn’t the only Ivy League opponent bested by Harvard this weekend.
The afternoon before the highly anticipated football game, the women of the Crimson swimming and diving team took on Columbia at the Percy Uris Natatorium for their third match of the season. Harvard (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) bested the Lions (0-2, 0-2) and nabbed the top spots in 10 of 16 events en route to a 189-111 victory.
“I think the team did really well,” freshman Jenna Gregoire said. “We have really great depth, and in every single race people put up fast times and race to win.”
The Crimson was putting up strong performances right from the first event—in the 3-meter diving competition, Columbia’s top performance by freshman Katie Furr was good enough for only fifth place. Junior Leslie Rea led the sweep of the top four slots with 277.13 points; sophomore Brittany Powell, freshman Schuyler Moore, and senior Jenny Reese filled in the second, third, and fourth spots, respectively.
The 400-yard medley relay was next up, and the Harvard swimmers followed up the divers’ dominance with another win. Senior Katy Hinkle, sophomore Kelly Robinson, junior Alicia Lightbourne, and Gregoire put together a strong run for a finish time of 3:50.63.
Hinkle also snagged event wins in the 100-yard backstroke and the 200-yard freestyle relay. Adding in her races at the tri-meet against Dartmouth and Cornell, the Arlington, Va. native can count three new pool records and an impressive five event wins on the young season.
The one race Hinkle failed to win was the 100-yard freestyle, where the sprinter claimed second place to sophomore Lion Katie Meili. The Texan finished first with a time of 51.49, and she also swam to first-place finishes in the 50-yard freestyle and the 400-yard individual medley.
Senior Annie Perizzolo, Meili’s teammate, also put up impressive times as she topped her competition in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke.
But Perizzolo’s and Meili’s leading performances were ultimately eclipsed by a steady Crimson effort.
“It was definitely a team effort,” co-captain Ali Slack said. “We went into it really trying to keep the momentum up from the week before, and I definitely think we succeeded. The first relay got us off to a great start, and from there on, everyone stepped up and swam well.”
Slack also noted the electric atmosphere that kept the entire team on its toes.
“Everyone was cheering and was very excited,” Slack explained. “As a senior, I’ve been to a lot of meets, and I think this was the most excited we’ve been.”
The squad’s unwavering enthusiasm was instrumental in keeping the team motivated and working hard through all 16 events. In the day’s final event, Gregoire, Slack, and junior Monica Burgos shared Hinkle’s victory in the 200-yard freestyle relay, and the quartet broke an Uris pool record with the facility-best time of 1:35.57.
“The relays really made a statement,” Gregoire said.
In addition to the strong relay performances, many strong individual showings came in from all class years for Harvard.
Freshmen Danielle Schulkin and Sara Li both saw wins in the pool—Li led a Crimson sweep as she won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:52.55, and Schulkin swam the 200-yard butterfly in 2:03.78, finishing over a full second ahead of Columbia junior Caitlin Rogers.
Classmate Schuyler Moore also contributed from the boards—she led a four-woman Crimson contingent with 268.73 points in the one-meter diving event.
“We had some freshmen really step up and take responsibility,” Slack said of the rookies’ fast times. “We had some seniors step up as well and show how well they could swim. Throughout all the classes, we had people swim well.”
Racing the 200-yard backstroke in 2:04.21, sophomore Caroline Weaver also stepped up and notched another win. She also finished second behind Hinkle in the 100-yard backstroke.
In the 500-yard freestyle, junior Catherine Zagroba claimed the top position with a time of 4:59.95, and senior Kate Mills, clocking in at 2:04.87, capped off the individual events with a 200-yard individual medley victory.
But the successful start to the season isn’t inspiring any sort of complacency; rather, it’s pushing the crew to work even harder.
“We’re going to work on the details and train hard in practice and focus,” Gregoire said. “But even when we’re home for Thanksgiving, we’re going to train.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seemed almost too good to be true. As the seniors of the Harvard football team filed into Saturday’s postgame press conference, beaming from one end of the table to the other, it was easy to forget all the moments that had gotten them there. Chris Pizzotti’s brilliance in 2007, the grit of the defense in the bitter cold a year later, fourth and 22 in New Haven last season, and finally Saturday’s win.
The Crimson class of 2011 went undefeated against Yale in its career and became the first group ever to add sweeps of Princeton and Dartmouth to go 12-0. And in a season when the game meant nothing for league standings (Penn’s easy win over Cornell Saturday sealed a second straight outright title), the culmination of these dominant four years reminded everyone why this weekend has been a campus fixation for 127 years—rivalry.
The meaning of rivalry to fans seems pretty clear, as Saturday’s final whistle sent spectators streaming onto the field and the band mocked the Bulldogs with Cee Lo Green’s hit song (we’ll stick to the radio-edited title, “Forget You”). Indeed, all across Cambridge this weekend fans on both sides engaged in familiar lighthearted (and sometimes not-so-lighthearted) exchanges that had little to do with football. But on Saturday, the rivalry seemed to translate more intensely onto the field than it has in any time in the past four years.
As anyone at Harvard Stadium this weekend can attest, the hits were more ferocious and the celebrations a bit more raucous than in past contests. And while we would never (and should never) condemn football players for competing with passion, the tension in the stands was palpable when a pair of helmet-to-helmet collisions sent three players to the sidelines—including one to the hospital—in the span of 90 minutes.
But for all the hard hits and the scary moments on the field, the fans can learn something very important from the players at Harvard-Yale: in the end, it’s just a game.
To be clear, just as there’s no point in criticizing tough play on the gridiron, there is little reason to stand on a soapbox and tell fans to tone it down for the biggest weekend of the year. One thing we must not forget, though, amid the chants of “safety school” and defending the fact that our mascot is a color, is how to separate the fun and the vitriol. While I saw a number of altercations on Mt. Auburn Street that could have easily been avoided this weekend, for all the intensity of the players, who hit much harder than drunk fans, there was no question after the game how they felt about their opponents. When asked about the terrifying hit that left seniors Gino Gordon and Jesse Reising momentarily unconscious, both sides remembered what was most important.
“This is just a game,” Gordon said when asked about Reising being carted off the field. “When people get hurt, you start to realize that just because we’re pitted against each other as rivals doesn’t mean that we don’t care about each other.”
“I didn’t even realize they were down for five or 10 seconds, because I was looking over to the sideline for the next play,” Yale captain Tom McCarthy added. “Then I realized they were both down on the ground, and it was a sigh of relief to see Gino get up.”
This level of concern can’t be taken for granted. With a rivalry as heated as Harvard-Yale, it’s not surprising that players took a few opportunities to get running starts before laying into opponents. But after the buzz died down in the stadium and the players breathed a collective sigh of relief from the news that Reising was fine, any of this supposed malice was erased for another year.
As the Crimson and the Bulldogs both capped solid seasons—both tying for second with Brown in the Ivy League standings—we can all take a lesson from the athletes. Getting riled up for the biggest game of the year is one thing, but in the end, it’s just a weekend. Here’s to hoping that next year the fans maintain the same level of respect for each other that the players do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his final game in a Crimson uniform, Harvard wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi showed his team exactly what it had been missing since he was sidelined by a broken collarbone.
Every time the Crimson needed a big play, Iannuzzi was there. Down 7-0 in the first quarter, Harvard was struggling to find its offensive rhythm in a frame dominated by the Yale rushing game. Then junior quarterback Collier Winters connected with Iannuzzi to bring the Crimson to the Bulldogs’ five-yard line. Harvard had faked out its opponents at the line of scrimmage with a flea-flicker play between Winters and junior receiver Adam Chrissis. The trick play was not enough to distract Yale’s secondary, but the Bulldogs’ triple coverage couldn’t keep Iannuzzi out of the red zone.
Before long, the Crimson had evened the score.
When a Yale-dominated second quarter sent Harvard into halftime with another seven-point deficit, it was again Iannuzzi who righted the ship.
After receiving Bulldog sophomore Philippe Panico’s kickoff at the 16-yard line, the receiver followed his blockers to the right side of the field before cutting back across to the left and bursting through an open lane. In front of a legion of Crimson fans, Iannuzzi sprinted alone into the endzone to even the score.
“It’s just like we drew up,” he said. “It was kind of a wash play, we all headed to the right and headed up for about 10 or so yards, and then we break that back left. And from there all I saw was just red jerseys, one kickout block, and I just saw the corner pylon and just went for it.”
After Iannuzzi brought the score to 14-all, Harvard would go on to score 14 more points before Yale finally found the endzone at the end of the game.
The play marked the second time Iannuzzi returned a kickoff for a touchdown this season. No Crimson player had reached the endzone on a kickoff return since 2006.
“He is the epitome of a difference-maker,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of Iannuzzi. “They’re hard to find, and he made a big difference today.”
BREAKTHROUGH
Coming into the game ranked second in the conference in rushing defense and third in sacks, the Crimson’s defensive line is arguably its most effective unit.
But for the entire first half of Saturday’s contest, the group looked more docile than dangerous.
Instead, the Bulldogs’ offensive line dominated the line of scrimmage, paving the way for its running backs to rush for 102 yards in the first half as compared to the Crimson’s 15.
But after halftime, Harvard was back to its dominant self. In the third quarter, senior defensive tackle Josué Ortiz led the charge with a sack and a blocked punt, while in the fourth quarter, it was senior defensive end Ryan Burkhead’s time to shine.
Burkhead finished the quarter, and the game, with 2.5 sacks for a net loss of 20 yards to go along with the eight tackles he posted on Saturday.
“During halftime, [defensive line coach Carlton] Hall came up to us, and it wasn’t a really fiery speech or anything, but he said we have to find something inside ourselves if we’re going to come back and win this game,” Burkhead said. “And that was really moving. I think everybody on the team really took it to heart. On the D-line, all year we’ve been persistent, fighting to get to the quarterback, and we wanted to win this game so bad. And really, I think that’s what made the difference in the end.”
SILENCE IN SOLDIERS FIELD
Diametrically opposed for most of the game, the two schools came together in terrified unity when a collision between Crimson senior running back Gino Gordon and Yale senior outside linebacker Jesse Reising left both players on the ground unable to get up.
Gordon was ultimately able to walk himself off the field, but Reising needed to be carted off to the emergency room in a stretcher. Bulldog coach Tom Williams later said that the measures were precautionary and that Reising is expected to be fine.
“Jesse is one of my close friends, and I never want to see something like that happen to my friend,” said Yale junior linebacker Jordan Haynes. “I’m glad to hear that Coach Williams said he was doing better. We just tried to rally around that and play for Jesse, but unfortunately it didn’t go our way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its rookies running like veterans, having no lead runner was no problem for the Harvard men’s cross-country team at the IC4A Championships.
While the women’s team opted out of participating in the ECAC Championships and captain Dan Chenoweth prepared for the NCAA Nationals today, the rest of the men’s squad traveled to Bronx, N.Y. on Saturday, where a strong freshman performance propelled the Crimson to a third-place finish on the Van Cortlandt Park course.
“I was absolutely thrilled with the results,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was a young group that was running out there, but they did a great job. I’m really proud of how competitive they were.”
“We’ve had a lot of issues throughout the year where we haven’t really put together our best performances together on the same day,” junior Michael Hoffmann said. “So to finish off the year with a third-place finish and to get some medals was nice, especially with the freshmen stepping up so soon after regionals and leading the team.”
The Crimson’s depth was evident this weekend, as the five scoring Harvard runners crossed the finish line in the top 45 of the competition—all placing in a higher position than the Crimson’s best finisher in 2009, who finished in 48th. The results helped Harvard improve upon last year’s 13th-place finish to tie for third in a 19-team field.
“To be able to jump up 10 places better than last year just shows how strong of a performance it was for everyone, but especially for the freshmen,” Hoffmann said.
Rookie Maks Korolev led the Crimson, taking 12th overall in 25:23.8—cutting about seven seconds off his personal record for the course.
“I was really pleased with how [Korolev] performed,” Saretsky said. “It looks like he’s developing into one of the top freshmen in the league.”
Korolev was followed by classmates Aaron Watanabe and Kurt Ruegg, who crossed the finish line in 27th and 28th, respectively, with only 0.4 seconds of separation between them.
Hoffmann completed the five-mile course in 38th, and freshman Kellen Blumberg rounded out the scoring for Harvard with a 42nd-place finish.
“It was a good overall day for everyone,” Hoffman said. “The team was really pleased with the results.”
The team’s newcomers have been under pressure to step up and perform all season, and it appears that they have now gained enough valuable experience to adjust to the distance and level of competition in college.
“The freshmen have done a great job at improving throughout the season,” Saretsky said. “We’ve got a great core group of runners who are very committed to this, and I’m really excited to see what they are going to be able to do in the course of their college careers.”
With the team competition season ending on a high note, this weekend’s results bode well for the Crimson in seasons to come.
“I think this definitely helped us in our outlook for next year,” Hoffmann said. “We lose Dan Chenoweth, who has been our top runner for the past three years, so we are going to have to rely on our depth. What we did today proves to us that we will be able to fill those holes and have that depth, especially when we will have the current freshmen with all the returning upperclassmen.”
“Part of the nature of our sport is looking at things you can do to improve, and there is a lot of work still ahead,” Saretsky said. “But I am extremely excited about the future. This program is ready to take off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the marquee event of Saturday took place at Harvard Stadium, the Harvard men’s basketball team traveled south to Macon, Ga., and managed to ruin another school’s weekend festivities.
Led by sophomore guard Christian Webster’s career-high 29 points, the Crimson (2-1) defeated Mercer (1-2) Saturday afternoon, 75-69, spoiling the Bears’ homecoming in the process.
“Coming into this environment, we knew it was going to be a hard-fought game, it was going to be a very tough opponent,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “A challenge for us as far as homecoming, all the energy and festivities surrounding it.”
A University Center crowd of 2,934 saw Webster go 7-of-11 from the field while sinking 12 free throws in 39 minutes of action. His final tally represented the most points for a Crimson player since Jeremy Lin ’10 scored 30 at Connecticut last December.
“He’s a lot more composed on the offensive end, he attacks a lot more, and he’s a lot smarter with his decisions when he drives this year,” sophomore guard Brandyn Curry said. “I’ve definitely seen a lot of improvements in his game from the summer.”
The wing’s efforts were bolstered by a typically solid performance by Curry, who collected 13 points and six rebounds in the win.
And after going a combined 2-for-19 from the field in the first two games of his career, rookie wing Laurent Rivard continued to fire away, accumulating 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting to become the only other double-digit scorer for Harvard.
The backcourt trio of underclassmen—who each nailed three triples—played a crucial role in stifling a comeback bid by the Bears. After Webster’s 19 first-half points had helped give his team a 37-27 halftime advantage, Mercer took its biggest swing at its visitors early in the second frame.
The Bears stepped up the defensive pressure from the first whistle, forcing six Harvard turnovers in the half’s opening five minutes.
The Crimson’s errant passes and wild dribbling, combined with several coast-to-coast layups by senior guard Jeff Smith, helped Mercer break out on a five-minute 15-2 run to go ahead, 42-39—the host’s first lead since midway through the first period.
But the young Crimson squad responded quickly to make sure the deficit would not last.
“We also knew that that run was coming, so we just kept our composure and battled back,” Curry said. “Especially with that vibe, they were definitely going to have a run at some point, so we dealt with that run...and regained control.”
Following a pair of Webster free throws, Harvard retook the lead on a three-point play down low by junior co-captain Keith Wright. The big man’s only points of the game gave his team a 43-42 advantage with 14:39 to play, and the Crimson would not trail again the rest of the way.
Repeated dribble-drive penetration by Curry and junior co-captain Oliver McNally leading to kickouts beyond the arc helped keep the Bears at bay, as Harvard shot a season-high 42 percent from the three-point line.
“We moved it well, then we made some open shots,” Amaker said.
Most of the offensive damage was done by the hot-shooting Rivard, Curry, and freshman Ernest Rouse (six points). Wright—the squad’s leading scorer entering the game—was saddled by foul trouble and double teams all game.
“He had two huge games against Holy Cross and George Mason, so we kind of figured that they were going to double team him in the post,” Curry said. “He didn’t force shots; he kicked the ball out...He didn’t try to do too much, and we picked him up.”
The Crimson’s other three big men combined for just five points; Mercer easily outscored its opponents in the paint, 32-10.
But the Harvard guards proved to be the difference. With just under three minutes to go, Curry went left at the top of the circle and threw the ball back across his body to Rivard on the right wing, who drained his final trey of the day to seal a six-point Crimson win.
The victory improved Harvard to 4-0 all time against the Bears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team obtained mixed results over the weekend at the annual Navy Classic in Annapolis, Md.
The Crimson (2-1) started out with an 84-76 win over Oral Roberts (2-3) on Friday afternoon, but the squad fell to host Navy (3-1) the next evening, 65-60. Senior Emma Markley had a pair of strong performances over the weekend, particularly on Friday, when she scored 25 points and grabbed nine rebounds against the Golden Eagles. The senior, along with freshman Christine Clark, put up a team-high 12 points against the Mids, but Harvard couldn’t overcome a large deficit and dropped its first game of the season.
“We were pretty happy with the first game of the weekend and pretty disappointed with [Saturday’s] loss,” co-captain Christine Matera said, “especially because it was based on our defensive performance, which was pretty poor in the first half.”
Villanova (3-1) also featured in the four-team showcase, but no match was scheduled between the Crimson and the Wildcats.
NAVY 65, HARVARD 60
Coming off a win the previous day, Harvard looked to maintain its perfect start to the season against host Navy. In last year’s matchup, the Crimson had no troubles against the Mids, winning by a 16-point margin, 71-55. It wasn’t the case this time around, with a dominant Navy team coming out strong in the first half.
Matera sank a three-pointer at the start, but as the game progressed, the Crimson displayed serious shooting woes for the first time this season. Harvard shot a miserable 20.8 percent in the first half, while the Mids hit roughly half their shots to create a sizeable lead by halftime, 40-19.
“Navy is a very physical team, and we can’t put ourselves in a hole like we did against them,” Matera said. “We need to come out stronger, and people who come off the bench need to provide that spark for the team.”
After the break, roles reversed as the Crimson slowly chipped away at the seemingly insurmountable lead. Harvard scored the first six points to start the period, and an 8-0 run with eight minutes to play reduced the deficit to 55-47. It didn’t stop there, as three consecutive field goals by the Crimson made it a three-point game with just over a minute left.
Leading scorer Angela Myers made a jump shot to keep Harvard’s threatening play at bay, but junior Brogan Berry sank a couple of free throws to keep it a one-possession game, 63-60.
Seventeen seconds were left on the clock when rookie Clark drove to the hoop, but Christine Consedine—Navy’s all-time leader in blocked shots—came up with a critical swat to effectively put a stop to the Crimson comeback. A foul by Harvard ensued, and Chey Arvin hit two free throws to end the game.
“I think these games have prepared us in the sense that this performance cannot happen again,” Matera said.
HARVARD 84, ORAL ROBERTS 76
Friday night’s win over Oral Roberts brought an all-around solid offensive performance by the Crimson, as four players had double-digit games in terms of scoring. Sophomore Victoria Lippert and Berry each contributed 15 points, but it was all about Markley, who led all players in scoring with 25 points.
“Emma is key for us,” Lippert said. “She can finish very difficult shots. She’s a force in the paint. It’s definitely very fun to play with her and great to have someone who can do what she can. She’s very difficult to stop.”
Berry was also active on the boards, grabbing eight rebounds and finishing the game with six assists.
Oral Roberts opened up an 8-2 lead to start the game, but the Crimson overcame the deficit and made it 24-16 with seven minutes left. Harvard established a 40-28 lead by halftime.
Even though Harvard was outscored, 48-44, in the second half, the Crimson was never in danger of losing control of the match. The Golden Eagles, led by Jaci Bigham’s 20-point performance, came within eight points with one minute left, but it was not enough.
“We stepped up our defense and we played pretty well against them,” Lippert said. “We accomplished the goals that we set for ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, The Back Page sat down with Harvard coach Tim Murphy to talk about his enormous success in his 17 years at the helm of the Crimson football program. Murphy has won five Ivy titles and 111 games with Harvard, and his team just wrapped up its 10th consecutive seven-win season, extending its own Ancient Eight record.
You can read the full feature in our Harvard-Yale supplement, but we couldn’t fit all of Murphy’s wisdom into one story. Here are further excerpts from our interview with the coach:
The Back Page: Harvard had its last losing season in 1998. What goes into sustaining that success?
Murphy: I think constant reeducation and never taking anything for granted. I heard one great investment icon say that we’re only as good as our next year. I wake up every day like there’s a bear in the bushes, ready to take my money, and I think there’s a lot of that. I think the reeducation part is important. We may have had the same basic system at Maine, at Cincinnati, and at Harvard, but we’re constantly tinkering with it to make it better. And I think the last part of it is, even though you may have a system, your personnel does change, so taking advantage of your personnel and tailoring your systems to the personnel you have [is key].
The Back Page: How does the program foster the qualities needed to succeed in pro football?
Murphy: I think part of it is letting kids know right up front that this is a big commitment, that anyone who tells you getting an education at an “elite” school and playing Division I football is easy, they’re not being honest with you. Harvard does a great job of that balance, and that’s why on the one hand they’ve got 41 Division-I varsity sports, on the other hand they still have the highest graduation rate in the country. But letting kids know that this is going to be challenging, and you have to have the right mindset to reach your potential on both sides of the river. And if you don’t have that mindset, then this probably isn’t the place for you. And I think over the long term, developing a culture where kids know that being a great athlete and being a great student are not mutually exclusive things—that that’s what we do at Harvard—and then working real hard at it. Some of the things we do, we do the hard way, because our particular sport is very hard. It’s very hard in terms of, you only have 10 games a year and you’re training 300-plus days a year. It’s very physically challenging, it’s very mentally challenging. So therefore, [you have to] find kids who have that character. And it’s not just being a great kid and a good representative of the school; it’s kids who are mentally and physically tough. You have to find those kids and attract those kids, and if you do that and you work real hard at it, you do a great job in your offseason program, strength and conditioning, and spring football; it’s amazing how much kids can improve. Kids that maybe people didn’t think were major college players are now capable of playing at the very highest level.
The Back Page: What was it like to get the chance to go abroad with the USO Coaches’ Tour this past spring?
Murphy: It was really one of the great experiences of my life. I say that because I’m not well traveled. All I’ve done is work my whole life—in fact my wife and I haven’t even had our honeymoon yet. So to go abroad and see how our Americans in the service work—the very difficult and challenging jobs that they have to do in very difficult environments—really was in some respects life-changing. It made me really appreciate what we have here, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it might not be a bad idea for every kid, when they graduate from high school, to travel or be of some type of service—whether that’s the Peace Corps or TFA or the Marine Corps—I don’t think that really matters. But I know one thing: you’ll come home with a much greater appreciation for what we have here in America, and I think you’ll be much better prepared for the next step in your life. But in summary, just tremendously impressed with the young people in the armed services. And I don’t necessarily mean the kids from Annapolis or West Point or the Air Force Academy. I mean the enlisted people who, like I said, [have] tremendously challenging jobs in very difficult environments and [are] not getting a whole lot of thanks for it. And I was just inspired by their morale; I was inspired by their professionalism. It made me take great pride in our country.
The Back Page: What lessons did you bring back to your team from that trip?
Murphy: The thing I bring back is, and this is something that we reinforce with our team members, and that is, we’re not entitled to anything. And if you think you are, because we do live a charmed life here at Harvard sometimes, but if you think you’re entitled to anything, if you think you’re better than anybody, all you need to do is see young people like this [in the service] or the different opportunities that they have and how fortunate you are. You better appreciate that, and you better have a profound respect for people who don’t have the opportunities you have.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy had a little fun with the postgame press conference after his Crimson squad topped Yale for the fourth straight year on Saturday. Following the 28-21 victory, the normally sparse interview table was filled from end to end with a host of Harvard seniors. Still, when the questions started flying, the coach got down to business, and we have the breakdown of some of his thoughts on fighting past Yale, momentum swings, and what he looks for in a recruit.
What Murphy said: “It was uphill all day. We finally got a foothold. We didn’t do a great job with prosperity and we went uphill again. The kids just battled and found a way to win.”
What Murphy means: The game was an “uphill” battle in the sense that Yale appeared to be spanking Harvard for the first quarter and a half before the home team found some life. This shift was no more apparent than along the Crimson defensive line, which was dominated early on by the Bulldogs’ front five. The interior linemen in particular struggled to shed blockers. The dynamic pair of junior Josué Ortiz and senior Chuks Obi—who Murphy has called “grown men” previously—looked like Pop Warner tackles for the first 30 minutes, but it wasn’t long before the duo found its groove. By the start of the third quarter, it was the Yale linemen who were being manhandled, as the Harvard defensive front finished with six sacks and a blocked punt by Ortiz.
What Murphy said: “We needed to make big plays, because we weren’t getting many opportunities. We weren’t creating enough opportunities offensively.”
What Murphy means: The 17-year head coach is intimately involved on the offensive side of the ball, so you can believe that when Murphy referenced the need to “create opportunities,” he had a big part in the playcalling that turned things around. After going three and out on its opening possession, the Crimson employed a flea-flicker the next time down the field to bite off a big chunk of yardage. Junior quarterback Collier Winters fired a lateral to junior receiver Adam Chrissis, who raced to the middle of the field and pitched it back to Winters. The QB then found senior Marco Iannuzzi streaking across the middle of the field, and the receiver brought the ball down to the five-yard line, setting up Harvard’s first score.
Murphy didn’t use trick plays like this one too often against Yale, but it certainly kick-started the offense in a hurry.
What Murphy said: “Again, I hate to put it in trite terms, but [it’s] just so much about heart. We preach so much about intangibles, just effort, intensity, perseverance, ability to deal with adversity. And that’s the type of kids we recruit. We recruit kids who have great character.”
What Murphy means: Murphy’s right—his comment about what it takes to win may have come off as trite, but it’s a formula that’s worked for the ball coach for nearly 25 years. Murphy has not strayed from his checklist in terms of recruiting, and he emphasizes in interview after interview the leg-up that football players have if they have faced adversity. The Crimson players showed plenty of perseverance in bouncing back against the Bulldogs on Saturday, and if Harvard hopes to dethrone Penn and return to the top of the Ivy League next season, the squad will need to maintain that toughness in 2011.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team announced its team captains for the 2011 season today. 2010 junior co-captain Carly Dickson got the nod to continue her leadership, and junior Georgia McGillivray will serve as Dickson’s companion during her senior season. Both women have been starters for their entire collegiate careers, and both hail from Victoria, B.C.
Dickson has already proven herself as a leader during the 2010 season, and her impressive record during her three years speaks volume to her dedication to the team. Having started 50 out of 51 games in the past three seasons, Dickson works her magic in the midfield, leading the team this season in assists and garnering numerous awards for her play, including second-team All-Ivy honors this season.
McGillivray is no less impressive in her track record. In addition to earning an All-Ivy honorable mention this fall, the back recorded three goals and led the Crimson defense to a formidable 2.00 goals allowed per game. She has started every game for Harvard since arriving in Cambridge in 2008.
Heading into next season, Dickson and McGillivray will lead a tough defensive team that has struggled at times to put points on the board. While the future looks optimistic for the Crimson field hockey team under the leadership of this pair of Canadians, there is still a lot of work to do in the offseason to make a run at the Ivy title in 2011.

Earlier this month, we invited readers to submit medical inquiries to Dr. Roger Kapoor, a resident at Harvard Medical School. In this follow-up post, Dr. Roger answers your questions.

I had a very stressful month at work and also noticed that I lost clumps of hair. Is there a connection?
Dr. Roger: Sorry to hear this has happened. Your intuition is spot on; there is a connection. The condition is called telogen effluvium and is a temporary increase in the rate of hair shedding. This is actually the second most common cause of hair loss (after genetic hair loss) and has a variety of causes, including stress. The good news is that this is temporary—you will experience complete regrowth of your hair—but the bad news is that it will take some time after the stress for it to come back (a few months to one year). For telogen effluvium, no treatment is necessary.
Would [Dr. Roger] recommend Propecia (finasteride)? Is it safe? Are there any side effects? Is it okay to drink heavily and do other drugs while you're on it?
Dr. Roger: Deciding whether or not to take finasteride should ultimately take place during an office visit with a physician after reviewing your medical history and ensuring that you are an appropriate candidate. The medication is not a panacea for hair loss but has been shown to benefit some men as long as they stay on it. That is to say, once you stop the medication, the hair that you may have gained or maintained will be completely lost within six to 12 months.
Finasteride typically takes about three months to see an effect. The side effects are rare and reversible but should be carefully considered in your decision. The most common side effects include abnormal ejaculation, breast tenderness, and reduced libido. For women, finasteride is pregnancy category X, meaning that it is known to cause birth defects and should not be taken if you are considering getting pregnant. Finasteride does not interact with many medications, though one medication, St. John's wort, has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of finasteride.
Drinking does not mean that you cannot take finasteride, but both finasteride and alcohol are broken down in the liver. If you are drinking enough alcohol to extensively damage your liver, then you should take precaution when considering taking finasteride. A number of people opt to begin treatment with topical minoxidil (Rogaine) and test its effectiveness before starting finasteride. Topical minoxidil can be bought over the counter and has minimal side effects.
