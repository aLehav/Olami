After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Berklee College of Music held their fourth annual International Womxn's Day Teach-In at the David Friend Recital Hall on Mar. 5, an event that included panels and performances by Berklee students, faculty, and affiliates.
The event began with a hip-hop infused modern dance performance entitled “Again, Breathe Again,” choreographed by Jazelynn Goody of Boston Conservatory at Berklee, one of the teach-in’s many panelists. The event’s small size gave Berklee students the opportunity to shuffle in and out of the small, circular event space in between classes, each with a different instrument slung on their backs. The event had advertised free food and merchandise: A stack of pamphlets for New Beginnings Re-entry Services — a support service for women coming out of prison — and a plastic bag of mint-colored pins emblazoned with “IWD 2020" lay on one end of the dimly lit room; a platter of cookies and fruits sat on the other end, slowly being picked at by the various students set to perform in between panels.
The first panel, "Intersectional Representation in the Industry: Existence and Artistry as Activism,” focused on the experience of different identities and intersections of identity in “an industry that has been largely managed by white, cis-gender men marketing artistry for profit in a capitalist, white-supremacist, patriarchal society,” according to the event organizers. Here, in this "safe and brave space," all aspects of identity were discussed and reflected on openly, paying special attention to the ways in which they interact.
“I suffered as a woman in a classical music field, but also as a lesbian,” said panelist Beth Denisch, speaking of her earlier time spent in the field. She went on to discuss the ways in which visibility from social media and growing intersectional movements have made it harder to erase identities such as hers. “Our authenticity gives us courage,” she said.
Annelot Prins, a researcher on gender in contemporary pop music, spoke of the discomfort she felt from being part of “both an oppressed and oppressive group” as a white woman. In creative industries, like most other industries, she said, “where they want women, they get white women.”
This idea permeated the comments of the other guests as well, who spent much of the panel talking about how they have been conditioned to accept being the exception in the industry. “Especially when I’m the only Black woman, I’m made to feel special,” said Tonya Butler, a 14-year veteran of the music industry, explaining how the patriarchal norms of the industry make it so that women take pride in their being the only one, rather than question the structures that made it so.
The second panel, “I Am Generation Equality: Realizing the Rights of All Womxn by Challenging the Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools," also focused on gender intersectionality, specifically the reality of being a Black woman in America. In this panel, the invited guests spoke mostly of the “‘school-to-prison pipeline,” the institutionalized way in which American public schools shutter Black children — including Black girls — into a life of incarceration.
“States determine the number of prison beds based on 3rd grade standardized test scores,” said Dr. Jasmine D. Parker, the associate director of Diversity and Inclusion at Berklee. “[The school-to-prison pipeline] functions whether people know it or not.”
The guests also spoke of the ways in which the pipeline disproportionately affects incarcerated womxn, as they struggle more to find jobs upon release and are often the primary caregivers for their families. “I did the better part of 30 years in and out of that revolving door,” said Stacey K. Borden, the director of New Beginnings, reflecting on the “deep traumas” that the system inflicted upon her and continues to inflict upon Black women and Black people more broadly.
The panelists also spoke of the experiences of Black women in Boston as a whole. “Boston is not an easy place to live. It is very very racist and very politically correct, and the political correctness strengthens the implicit bias,” Parker said as she recalled her difficulties trying to find a place to rent in Boston as an educated Black woman.
In between panels, various Berklee musicians outfitted in guitars, basses, and saxophones performed original songs and covers to the ever-shifting audience. Artists of all genres and identities took to the stage, each pouring their souls into their choice of original songs or IWD-relevant covers — cementing the event as a striking show of solidarity and intersectionality in music and the arts in general.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, The Weeknd’s latest album marks the beginning of a new era. “After Hours” strips back the early optimism of fame with a futuristic sound but familiar R&B feel. On top of his famously laid-back synths, the album relays a sonic and lyrical exploration of loneliness. It embraces a distinct sentiment of disenchantment with The Weeknd’s current lifestyle and deviates from the more carefree falsetto on his past songs like “I Feel It Coming” and “Can’t Feel My Face.”
The Weeknd’s previous album, “Starboy,” which carries more of a free-spirit vibe, revolves around his newfound fame. However, he begins to stray away from this excitement in “After Hours,” delving into the darker sides of the success his music has brought him. The lavish lifestyle he has reveled in no longer possesses the same charm — it lacks substance. He repeatedly returns to themes of being blind, alone, and bleeding out, particularly in the tracks: “Alone Again,” “Heartless,” “Blinding Lights,” and the lead single “After Hours.”
In “Heartless,” The Weeknd refers to himself as a cold and empty man who has “lost [his] heart and [his] mind.” He sings, “Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless,” and then “Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless.” He accepts his failure to hold himself to higher standards, which he accredits to being “heartless.” The Weeknd often returns to this theme of attempting to escape the degrading and vain lifestyle he loses himself in, but being unable to do so. This is especially apparent in the title track, “After Hours.” He articulates, “My darkest hours / Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room / Different girls on the floor, distractin’ my thoughts of you / I turned into the man I used to be, to be.” The Weeknd’s descent into his previous, indulgent lifestyle seems almost involuntary, even though he is aware of it happening.
He also relates this inevitable return to his “old ways” to a failed romance with his ex-lover. This is further illustrated in “Scared to Live,” where he sings, “I am not the man I used to be / Did some things I couldn't let you see” and “I should have made you my only.” The Weeknd blames the collapse of the love he once shared with his ex on his own inability to be loyal, but then again, does not express a strong desire to change this tendency. “After Hours” seems to echo The Weeknd’s recognition of his shortcomings but underlines his lack of will to recreate himself into someone who upholds these standards.
Furthermore, “After Hours” encompasses another theme: desperate dependence on the affection of his lover, whom he ultimately lets down. In the title track, “After Hours,” The Weeknd conveys this vulnerability to his audience. He sings, “Put myself to sleep / Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams,” and, on the chorus, “Where are you now when I need you most? / I'd give it all just to hold you close / Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart.” The Weeknd keeps finding himself returning to the same broken love that he, in part, credits himself for destroying, and is apologetic for hurting anyone else in the process, particularly his lover.
In his music, The Weeknd often returns to the superficial aspects of life like wealth, sex, and drugs, which grant immediate satisfaction and do not require feeling. In “After Hours'' he sings, “I was running away from facin' reality, uh / Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies / Spendin' money to compensate, compensate.” In other words, he does not seem to have any particular message for his audience, but instead seems like he just wishes to share his emotions. And although his new album focuses more explicitly on this kind of hollow pleasure, it’s hardly a new theme for The Weeknd.
The Weeknd’s progression as an artist and individual since his debut also makes its mark in his music style, which has strayed from mainstream pop to something more retro, but with a singular, futuristic flare. It is the perfectly-curated, high quality sound and unique flavor that keeps bringing his audience back.
This trust between fan and artist is almost a type of blindness — similar to that The Weeknd himself lives with and infuses into his music. But it is a consenting blindness, one that breaks and defines The Weeknd; and it does not appear to be disappearing from his music any time soon.

Lauv’s new album, “~how i’m feeling~,” is a consummate ode to the exposure of raw emotion. Lauv falls into a particular category of popstar boys which includes, among others, Justin Bieber, the members of LANY, Russ, and Khalid. All produce a similar sound — melodic, dreamy, electronic, and more than a little soporific and whiny. This is not to say, of course, that their sound doesn’t work. Singer-songwriter Lauv found major success beginning in 2015, when he uploaded his viral hit “The Other” to SoundCloud and it gained global traction. After his initial success, Lauv went on to co-produce and co-write “No Promises” with Demi Lovato and Cheat Codes. He gained widespread name-recognition with “I Like Me Better” in 2017 (featured in virtually every rom-com for the next year and a half) and his album “‘I Met You When I Was 18 (The Playlist)” in 2018.
“~how i’m feeling~,” dropped on Mar. 6, is not a departure from Lauv’s traditional sound, but rather an extended exploration into what works. Which is to say: breathy vocals, love-stricken lyrics, and ethereal background EDM. It is not music for dancing or for celebrating — it is music for movie montages and the early, sun-soaked honeymoon days of a brand-new relationship (and, later, the long, melancholic nights of a brand-new breakup).
The album’s release style is unique. Somewhat like the rollout for “I Met You When I Was 18,” Lauv released songs periodically, beginning with “i’m so tired” with Troye Sivan in January 2019. The song is one of the best on the album, catchy and just melodramatic enough to be unavoidably relatable. Moreover, “i’m so tired” was a smash success: As of mid-March, it has been streamed almost 463 million times on Spotify.
Lauv followed the reception of “i’m so tired” with “Drugs & The Internet” in April 2019. “Drugs & The Internet,” which kicks off “~how i’m feeling~,” is also one of the better songs on the album, one of many in a series of bare-naked, honest reflections from commercial artists about mental illness, substance abuse, and unsuccessful attempts to fill an internal void.
This is the crux of Lauv’s widespread following. His songs convey unmasked, tangible emotion, and are therefore compelling to a host of listeners searching for something to match what they feel — the kind of songs to listen to during a private Spotify session; the kind of songs that belong on a private Spotify playlist.
Lauv followed the release of “Drugs & the Internet” with “Feelings,” “Sad Forever,” and “Mean It,” this last song the byproduct of a collaboration with LANY. Most recently, in August, he released “Fuck, I’m Lonely” for the Netflix original series “13 Reasons Why,” a tribute to adolescent angst.
“~how i’m feeling~” is not a great album. It is consistently good — most songs achieve at least a three-star rating, with standouts including “Feelings,” “Modern Loneliness,” “Julia,” “Sims,” “i’m so tired,” and “Drugs & The Internet.”
What prevents it from being great, though, is its overwhelming monotony. Lauv has perfected one kind of sound and, with few exceptions, has resolutely refused to deviate from it. He remains in the same six-note range — the same precise, quirky-but-not-too-quirky autotune — and therefore has produced a good, but wholly homogenous, studio album.
It is the kind of album that contains great standalone songs to be incorporated into other playlists, but becomes painful to listen to without pause all the way through. The diagnosis is altogether too much of the same, because oftentimes, the progression is so subtle, it is difficult to distinguish when one song has become another.
That said, one-trick pony or not, “~how i’m feeling~” is an overall crowd-puller, even if it is not a resounding triumph. The album mirrors almost perfectly how it feels to be a young adult in the 21st century, with its conflux of messy love and emotion, late-night profile stalking, and lingering questions of requitedness; of the depression pandemic and the Internet and the incessant search for something real among a sea of holographic projections.
“~how i’m feeling~” is repetitive, and at times mildly trite, but it also has moments of true depth. This is Lauv’s saving grace: While he reproduces and remains true to a single sound, that single sound is superlative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the face of a pandemic, how do you get people to wash their hands?
The Vietnamese government’s answer: Enlist some of the country’s top names in music for an informational collaboration that, according to comedian John Oliver, “absolutely slaps.”
Oliver is absolutely right. The Vietnamese National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health teamed up with producer Khắc Hưng and singers Min and Erik to create the three-minute PSA, a spin on the trio’s biggest hit — “Ghen,” or “Jealous.” Its title? “Ghen Cô Vy,” or “Jealous Coronavirus.”
The video, which helpfully includes a link to the CDC’s coronavirus page, opens with adorable animated versions of Min and Erik scowling at a TV broadcast on their living room floor. Min then explains that a “hot” new virus is in town as the screen displays three bright green cartoon viruses, complete with crowns and menacing smiles. By referring to the virus with the Vietnamese pronoun “em” — used to address younger siblings and juniors — Min and Erik make a confident statement about our power to stop its spread.
From there, the duo alternate lines until the end of the first verse, when Erik urges the public to prevent the virus from “burning up.” To illustrate his point, yellow and orange flames fill the screen before the chorus begins.
It’s a fitting way to set the stage for — to quote Oliver, who featured the video on his show — a “genuine club banger.” The tempo picks up, and Min and Erik rattle off ways to combat the coronavirus: Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. Avoid crowded places. Keep your health up. Clean your space. Be socially aware.
The best part? All this information is set to an incredibly catchy tune. And the chorus, from start to finish, lasts about 20 seconds, the CDC’s recommended duration for hand-washing time. Instead of “Happy Birthday,” why don’t we all start singing “Ghen Cô Vy” in front of our bathroom mirrors?
The video, which quickly took off in Vietnam and beyond, inspired an equally unforgettable TikTok challenge. Vietnamese dancer Quang Đăng choreographed a short step sequence, which, as he explained on his Instagram, contains the “6 hand washing movements as recommended by the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health, based on the music song.”
In a recent interview with CNN, Đăng said that “our mind [and] our education” are key to eradicating the virus. CNN’s Kristie Lu Stout described his approach as “spreading joy, not germs.”
If you’re wondering how to make the hours of self-isolation fly past, look no further than “Ghen Cô Vy.” Watch the video. Sing along. Dance your heart out. And remember to wash your hands.
