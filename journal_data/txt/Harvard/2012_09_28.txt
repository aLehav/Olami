After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a Harvard senior—let’s call her Sofia—was having coffee with two friends who had just accepted their summer job offers at big companies in New York. She wants to work in theater or arts management, and one friend noticed the worried look that darkened Sofia’s face when her friends mentioned their jobs.
“Don’t worry,” Sofia remembered her soon to be high-paid friend saying. “You’re following your passion!
Sofia isn’t the only one who’s told me stories like this. Dozens of students I’ve talked with describe the challenges of senior fall in these terms. “Is doing recruiting selling out?” wondered one senior English concentrator who has also considered trying to get a reporting job at a magazine. “I’m worried the lucrative stuff is going to feel really substanceless,” a government concentrator told me. Over and over, students I’ve interviewed describe their thinking in these terms: they feel that can follow either their passions or a big paycheck.
But is “passion versus paycheck” the best way for Harvard students to be thinking about career choices? And why is it that many students seem to accept this binary?
I want to be clear from the start about the limitations of these reflections: I’m writing at Harvard, about Harvard. This may not apply to all; for students who need to support their families or who face other substantial financial burdens, these questions may simply not matter. And in national terms, Harvard students are extraordinarily lucky even to be able to entertain these kinds of ideas.
But this good fortune also brings a heightened responsibility. Because Harvard students often have choices, we also have to think about making the right choices for the lives we will lead—and, in particular, about the way that our context may shape how we make our decisions.
The 2008 financial crisis profoundly shook confidence in many of the forces that had shaped how Harvard students made decisions about jobs. The extremely negative public perception of the financial services industry after the crisis, combined with the fall in hiring because of a weakened economy, have complicated the “paycheck” side of the binary. Indeed, the number of graduating seniors taking jobs in financial services and consulting has fallen from 47 percent in 2007 to only around 20 percent in 2012.
In that lost world where so-called generalists were hired on a massive scale at sprawling service-oriented firms, that time of ready money and ready answers, a paycheck may well have seemed substitute for a passion. But now? These changes in how students are being employed make the “passion or paycheck” binary seem less obviously relevant: many of the jobs that students want fall on a spectrum between the two would-be poles.
The disruptive effect of technology on traditional business provides an excellent example. If you are passionate about fashion, you have more options than working the floor at Bloomingdale’s—there are Internet companies like Gilt Groupe, the online luxury sale site. If you are passionate about giving voice to ordinary people, there’s Twitter. And the list goes on.
But this excitement can seem overwhelming, too, because these options demand new personal frameworks in which to make decisions, without reducing the world to premade categories that may not apply. Our first career choice begins to define our post-college identity and our community contribution. Rather than falling into a way of thinking that makes less and less sense at this historical moment, we should push ourselves to find new approaches to understanding our choices and making career decisions.
Over the course of the semester, I will be looking at individual students’ stories and investigating several possible frameworks in an attempt to start this conversation. Subsequent columns will examine the ways that students think about skill acquisition (how they will develop a flexible twenty-first century professional skill set) and other professional goals. Most importantly, I will emphasize students’ growing desire to have public-impact careers—broadly defined as careers that allow individuals to have a positive social impact through their work—and show how students use this criterion to assess new jobs in technology, media, health, and other sectors. This series will pay particular attention to efforts that extracurricular organizations and University support systems like the Office of Career Services are making to facilitate innovative thinking on these issues.
Talking about these choices and changes can be uncomfortable, even embarrassing. Many of us like to keep these things to ourselves—but we can benefit from opening the dialogue. The potential reward is significant: to break out of the artificially delimiting “passion versus paycheck” mentality and to find alternative ways of thinking about our careers and our futures.

In 2010, at the height of his transition from failed primary candidate to Republican Party nominee, Mitt Romney released “No Apology.” The book, part memoir and part policy platform, offers—in light of profound skepticism on the right—a moderately progressive stance on climate change. “I believe that climate change is occurring,” Romney wrote. “I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control.”
The two-year period that began with No Apology and ended with the Republican National Convention this month witnessed radical changes in Romney’s position on climate change. His climate policy is marked by a crucial linguistic shift: rather than use the neutral and scientifically accurate terminology of “climate change,” Romney now refers to “global warming.” This switch is not inconsequential. All too often, climate change deniers pillory climate science by mocking cold temperatures and extreme weather events as betrayals of global warming. Furthermore, Romney has gone from acknowledging the role of human activity, to downplaying it, to almost ignoring it altogether. Romney’s slide into the empty rhetoric of the right’s climate denial is a lamentable decline for a man who once held reasonable views on what we view as the greatest existential threat to our planet.
Romney’s shortsighted and uninformed bombast obscures the remarkable scientific consensus on climate change. A report released Tuesday by the Better Future Project examines the climate views of scientists from Brigham Young University and Harvard, the two institutions from which he holds degrees. Of BYU professors who have published on climate science in peer-reviewed journals, 86% agree with the scientific consensus on climate change; a full 100% of Harvard professors do. Romney is neglecting the expertise of both of his alma maters and other universities.
Romney’s repeated shifts on climate change have not gone unnoticed. Today, tens of thousands of petition signatures, collected as a challenge to Romney to “articulate his plan for addressing the most urgent issue facing humanity,” will be delivered to his campaign headquarters in Boston. This effort, coordinated by activist William E. McKibben ’82 and 350.org, is testimony to the issue’s unparalleled salience for our generation. The relative lack of debate on climate change between President Obama and Romney betrays grassroots support for swift and decisive attempts to ameliorate its effects.
We believe that behind Candidate Romney stands a man who still holds the reasoned views on climate change he expressed just two years ago. Romney has shifted his views to an untenable position that ignores the gravity of the climate crisis. Without any scientific evidence to support this reversal, we can only assume that Romney caved to pressure from a vocal minority that is locked in denial.
At the RNC, Romney blithely said, “President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.” Climate change, despite his comment that “they do not call it America warming, they call it global warming,” is a matter of both American values and family values. Climate change determines the sort of world in which we will live our lives, in which Mitt Romney’s grandchildren will live their lives, and in which the families Romney prides himself on helping will live their lives. Romney has staked his campaign’s ideology on leadership and responsibility; climate change, more so than any other issue, demands those two qualities.
That the discussion over climate change has been reduced to ill-informed sound bites is a disservice to the American public. We call on Mitt Romney to acknowledge the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and provide the electorate with a concrete plan to tackle its effects. Addressing climate change does not spell economic or geopolitical doom for the United States; rather, it is a prime opportunity to reinvigorate the energy industry, strengthen national security, and usher in an era of technological innovation. Only through mature dialogue can we reframe the way in which this country is a leader amongst nations and a responsible steward of limited global resources.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the presidential election looming, I have been thinking a lot about the voting process.  After all, this is the first time I time I will legally be able to vote for the President of the United States. During the last few months, I have been pondering whether to obtain an absentee ballot from my home state of Pennsylvania or to declare myself a Massachusetts resident in order to physically cast a vote here.  Just as I became convinced that Pennsylvania would be relegated to political obscurity after only a brief period of electoral competitiveness, the state drudged into unprecedented political relevancy.  Suddenly, I found myself debating a voting issue that propelled my home state into national headlines.
Pennsylvania now finds itself in the midst of one of this year’s biggest political controversies: the voter identification law requiring individuals to submit proof of citizenship before casting their ballots. This initiative made national news about a month ago, when it was signed into law, and has attracted national attention from those who claim it is a way for the Pennsylvanian Republican Party to suppress reliably blue votes in places like inner city Philadelphia.
For the past month now, I have debated the pros and cons of the issue, firmly undecided on my opinion of the matter. I am sympathetic to the cause of cracking down on voter fraud—there is no doubt in my mind that only full-fledged citizens should have the right to vote. Ensuring that this remains the case seems to be a noble pursuit. If the ID cards are truly gratis—which they are—I see no reason to believe asking voters to obtain them to be an overly capricious request. After all, if Americans are truly looking to participate in the civic responsibility of democracy, they should have no problem working within societal measures in this age of hyper-security.  Proof of identification is required for a whole host of functions in daily life—I have no shortage of memories about giving recreational sports leagues my social security number during my youth. This law, it seemed, was “reasonable,” the word I would use most when describing it. I will admit that my defense of the measure contained a hint of equivocation, as I was not prepared to occupy the position as a knowledgeable Pennsylvania voter.
Last week, that all changed. Ironically enough, it was a video played during the Democratic National Convention that changed my mind. The video extolled the advantages of the state, saying that, “government is the only thing we all belong to.” It denigrated our various interests in civil society by mocking our “different churches, different clubs”—the sort of civil society Alexis de Tocqueville lauded in observing American greatness. This, I immediately thought, is not the way I envision my American citizenship. I do not belong to the government. America is not a communist country, and the government is not the Party. No, the government belongs to me.
Thus, I became opposed to my state’s contentious voter ID law. The government only exists because we, as citizens, vote it in place. There is no government without people to elect it. By ensuring that citizens wishing to vote are registered with the government, the state immediately assumes the dominant side in the relationship. Suddenly, instead of a government that only exists when there are voters, there are voters who only exist at the whims of the government. Giving the government the power to decide who gets to vote it in and out of power is a dangerous precedent that can lead to widespread disenfranchisement. The law already gives the government the authority to reject college IDs from out of state or those lacking expiration dates. I understand that, in theory, individuals can obtain free ID cards from the government, but government is, in practice, quite possibly the most ineffective institution ever built by man. Any piece of legislation with the ability hurt citizens with the dual-edged sword of government malevolence and feebleness seems ill-advised.
We the People. Two hundred and twenty-five years later, this phrase still serves as the opening to this country’s historic governing document. It should also serve as a reminder that we created the government. We controlled its rise and, if we decide so electorally, we can control its fall. Government did not create us. While this summer’s landmark Supreme Court case may have ruled that government does have the power to mandate—er, tax—us, that does not mean we should let that happen lightly. It is one thing for government to ruminate on the best policies for the general welfare. It is quite another for government to legislate when the only welfare at stake is its own.
I will vote in Pennsylvania. Obtaining an absentee ballot is a bothersome task but one of newfound importance. While my vote may not matter in either the presidential or senatorial contests, it will matter for legitimacy. It will serve as a reminder that I control the government. The government of Pennsylvania can only exist as long as I vote it in. I need to send it that message in a hurry.

Last week, members of the Harvard Faculty Club wait staff filed a complaint in Middlesex County Superior Court alleging that Harvard illegally withheld the proceeds of service charges from the staff. If true, the Faculty Club would have violated Massachusetts’ “Tip Law,” which states that, “under no circumstances may management employees or owners receive any portion of their employees’ tips” or “service charge.”  When asked about the allegations, Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin responded that Faculty Club employees receive wages that surpass industry standards, in addition to benefits including health care, access to child care, paid vacation, and tuition assistance. If the allegations are true, it is wrong of the Harvard Faculty Club to give the appearance that customers are contributing to the employees in the form of a service charge when in reality the employer is withholding it.
The fact of the matter is that any patron glancing at an 18-22 percent surcharge on a restaurant bill will be under the impression that the money is going to the wait staff. This is doubly so considering that, presumably, it is uncommon to leave a tip on the table at the Faculty Club along with a service charge. Indeed, if the allegations are true then the Faculty Club’s failure to remit the surcharge to the wait staff are doubly dishonest, deceiving not only the workers, but the patrons as well.
Harvard works to make both its faculty and students act in accordance with the law, and their diligence should not be weakened when it comes to laws protecting labor. Cutting corners on worker protections has the distinction of being not only harmful to the parties involved, but also reputationally damaging to the University.
Only days before the Faculty Club wait staff filed their suit, the Harvard Club of Boston had to settle for $4 million for similar accusations. While the Harvard Club of Boston and Harvard University are not formally affiliated, it is seriously unfortunate that two organizations bearing the Harvard name have been accused of breaking state labor law in the same year. In an era that is marked by high levels of income inequality, it is especially inappropriate for institutions that are very wealthy to scrape up a few extra dollars by not giving the wait staff money that is, by all appearances, intended as compensation for their service. It was likely to avoid such abuses that the General Court of Massachusetts passed the “Tip Law” in the first place.

Ryan R. Christ ’13 has always loved making models of how things work. When his mother gave him a library card at age eight, he went straight for “the molecule books” to make little drawings of how atoms turned into earthly matter and living things.
“I was all over this idea that you could model the universe and how it works,” he said.
He wanted to be a theoretical physicist until 10th grade—when he realized how much math that would take.
So in his first year at Harvard, Christ tried his hand at biology instead, studying Alzheimer’s disease in HMS professor Mel Feany’s lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Many scientists suspect that Alzheimer’s develops when brain cells lose their ability to traffic molecules within their interiors. Christ tested this idea in fruit flies, manipulating the cargo-moving proteins in their neurons and lighting them up with fluorescent dye to see how trafficking activities were associated with disease.
To do this, he inspected glowing fruit fly brains, one by one.
“Imagine trying to dissect out a fruit fly brain with forceps under the microscope,” he said. “If you had drunk coffee and your hands were shaky, forget it.”
The delicate labor paid off. Months in, Christ glimpsed a fruit fly brain under his microscope that stood out: a brain that had abnormally high amounts of a trafficking protein called Rab6, and fewer signs of  Alzheimer’s damage than in other flies.
“That was one of the most exquisite moments in lab,” Christ said. “Soon I was sitting with 20 'Nature' papers spread around me, drawing model after model furiously on my whiteboard to imagine how this protein might work.”
In sophomore year, Christ began imagining bigger models—curious not only to understand how Rab6 functions in the fruit fly, but how vast, interconnected systems of similar proteins might work together in humans.
This work is called “pathway analysis”—the science of modeling how genes work in systems, how they evolve and get passed in our DNA from generation to generation, and how they cause human disease when they go haywire.
It’s also a field that Christ learned would demand a lot of mathematics. This time he dove in, declaring an Applied Mathematics concentration and advanced standing to receive a Masters degree in Statistics.
“I realized I needed the math to build the kinds of models I wanted to build,” he said.
One of the first things that Christ and roommate Joshua Wortzel ’13 did when they became roommates in Lowell House their junior year was to buy a whiteboard for themselves.
“We took a maiden voyage to Home Depot and got this huge whiteboard—eight by four feet—and put it above Ryan’s bed,” Wortzel said. “Sometimes he pulls out the dry erase pens and goes crazy with his theories.”
It's just one example, Wortzel added, of an “insatiable excitement about nearly everything.”
“You rarely see a soporific Christ,” Wortzel said. “The more tired Ryan is, somehow the more energetic he becomes, and it’s absolutely infectious.”
This year, Christ transitioned to HMS neurology professor Philip L. De Jager’s genetics lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Christ is developing a statistical model to study genetic pathways that affect how quickly Alzheimer’s disease progresses.
These Alzheimer’s-related pathways are suspected to be under recent natural selection—showing up more in today’s human population than in previous generations. Reasons why remain unclear, and Christ hopes his model will help solve the mystery.
His experience with Alzheimer’s reaches far back into his childhood: he has cared for both a great-aunt and a grandfather with the disease.
“I saw loss [from Alzheimer’s] in a very  tangible way at a young age,” he said. Here, he has founded a group called the Alzheimer’s Buddies Program that pairs students with residents at a local nursing home who have dementia. His own buddy, Sofia, is a physician from the Ukraine.
“I call her my 85-year-old girlfriend,” he said. “Every week I bring her white flowers, and god forbid I forget them!”
Looking ahead, Christ hopes to improve his model and apply it to studying infectious diseases.
After a summer of public health work in Tanzania, he is especially interested in malaria.
He was struck by how the disease causes vast and long-term debilitation in African youth—just like Alzheimer’s does in the elderly.
“I want to work on diseases that disrupt years that could otherwise be fulfilling, wiping away life without killing you.”
And it is by using statistics—perhaps as an infectious disease specialist, or an academic researcher, or a physician—that he hopes to tackle the challenge.
“This model-building thing that I’m still doing now, that curiosity has always been there,” Christ said.“It all started with a public library card, baby.”

Are humans selfish beings or is our first impulse to be cooperative?
In a Nature article published on Sept. 20, researchers in Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics proffered a solution to this age-old question of human nature. Researchers focused on solving this puzzle spanned many disciplines.
The group includes David G. Rand, a postdoctoral fellow in psychology, social sciences professor Joshua D. Greene ’96, and professor of mathematics and biology Martin A. NowakThese researchers developed a “public goods game” in which subjects were offered two options: to keep the money they were given or to contribute it to a pool that would be allocated for the group’s benefit.In an effort to simulate intuitive and deliberative responses, subjects were either asked to act immediately or to contemplate their decisions.
“When people have the chance to respond to others, is their first response altruistic or to have self-control?” asked Rand.
The researchers found that subjects’ first impulses were cooperative, while deliberation led to actions based in self-interest.
However, researchers cautioned that the study’s results were more indicative of subjects’ experiences rather than innate human characteristics.
“It might be easy to jump to the conclusion that cooperation is innate or hardwired,” said Rand. “We are not showing that at all, but rather that your intuition is shaped by your experiences in the world; if you grow up in a cooperative environment, you will be more cooperative, and if you grow up in an uncooperative environment, that will likely be your initial response.”
The scientists also discussed potential applications of their work, suggesting that emotional appeals to the masses may be more effective than logical ones, because logical arguments can cause people to act more selfishly.
Rand cautioned against the prevailing modes of leadership training.
“The executive educational system that trains individuals to make decisions in a rational and unbiased way may actually have unintended consequences and make people more selfish."

“Is black a color?” “Does black even exist?”
According to Harry Cooper, Curator and Head of Modern Art at the National Gallery of Art, the answer to both of these questions is no.
At the latest Andrew W. Mellon Symposium in Conservation Science, held Saturday in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Cooper joined scientists and artists from around the country to discuss the material and immaterial aspects of color, ranging from the dyes of the Renaissance Italian palette to the preservation of American minimalist artist Dan Flavin’s colored neon bulbs.
The day-long event was organized by Erin R. Mysak, a postdoctoral fellow in Conservation Science.
“I hope for the general audience to understand a bit more about how science and art are interrelated,” Mysak said. “It’s often hard for the public to access science, and it’s not so much that way with art. I wanted to try to bring science to the public and help the public understand how scientists add to the scholarly body on art."
The topic of color was explored from a variety of angles throughout the day. Lectures ranged from Renaissance Italian art to color in archaeological material to brilliant marine-quality enamel. Francesca Esmay, conservator of the Panza Collection at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, presented on Flavin’s electric lights.  Esmay elaborated on the challenge of maintaining Flavin’s artwork despite the perpetual need for replacement bulbs, highlighting the difficulty of sustaining a work of art as technology changes.
“The range of talks was quite good,” said Richard Newman, the Head of Scientific Research at the Museum of Fine Arts.  “I was very intrigued by the combination of science and art. They packed quite a lot in one day.”
The intersection of art and science drew approximately 160 people over the course of the day, Mysak said. Through posters, she targeted MIT and Harvard students as well as professionals in science, conservation, and art.
“Even if it has a very spiritual point, material is still important,” Newman said. “I have always felt that understanding the materials in art is essential to understanding the art itself. Anybody interested in art is interested in the creative process.”Shahin Ismail-Beigi, a freelance editor, attended the event to concentrate on the notion of color.
“It is very important to understand how to communicate something conceptually and emotionally through color,” he said.
Artists also came to learn more about how science affected their profession.
“You can’t talk about contents without the form and material,” said Wilhelm Neusser, a painter. “I really like the variety of approaches to the question of color all across the centuries.”

“For the next 45 minutes, I am going to take you on a journey south,” said Chris A. Linder, photographer and author of Science on Ice: Four Polar Expeditions.
Linder proceeded to relate tales from his travels to the southernmost region of the world—Antarctica—in a talk at the Harvard Museum of Natural History on Saturday.
While his book is about expeditions in both the Antarctic and Arctic, Linder focused on his journeys to Cape Crozier and Cape Royds on Ross Island, Antarctica.
Linder’s talk was one of a series of five, spanning eight days, which took place in Cape Cod, Harvard, and Minnesota. He said hopes to educate and inspire the public about science through his photography.
The talk was split into different topics, including the process of traveling to Antarctica, the life of the indigenous penguins, and the life of a photographer.
Before heading south, Linder had traveled throughout the Arctic.
He described his journeys in the Beaufort Sea, just  north of Alaska,  and aboard Oden, exploring the Gakkel Ridge.
After these excursions, the research of marine biologist David G. Ainley on the Adélie penguins drew Linder to Ross Island in Antarctica.
“I wasn’t interested in just Adélie penguins per se,”  Linder said. “It could have been any topic, but David’s work is very well respected and it had been going on for years.”
One of only two sea ice-obligate penguin species, the Adélie are dependent on the ice for survival.
Linder spoke in depth about their lives and the effects of climate change on the sea ice-obligate birds. Each year, melting sea ice and snowfall cause the Adélie to be further pushed south.
According to Linder, eventually there will be nowhere left to go as the ice melts, and the penguins will either have to adapt or face extinction.
While on Ross Island, Linder spent his time learning how to survive in the Antarctic and sleeping at odd times, since he regularly photographed the penguins at midnight.
However, for Linder, the journey to Cape Crozier and Cape Royds was not just about working with Ainley and seeing the Adélie penguins: every step of his journey was documented.
When he talked about going through what he called “how to not die in the Antarctic” school, Linder showed photos to accompany his talk.
“My daughter and I enjoyed [the talk] very very much–it was reminiscent of our trip,” said Harvard B. Kolm, an attendee who had ventured to the Antarctic in 1995 aboard a Russian research vessel.
The audience consisted mostly of Boston and Cambridge residents. Many parents had brought their children, hoping to spark or cultivate an interest in science.
“Science is one of my favorite subjects and I’ve always been interested in Antarctica, so when my mom found this I was excited to go,” said Owen M. Smith, a 12-year-old from Boston.

The mid-20th century Soviet Union was not a friendly place for biologists. Stalin’s regime had outlawed all research in genetics—declaring the science and its founder Gregor Mendel antithetical to Marxist teachings—and waged a vicious campaign to execute or imprison the field’s adherents.
After losing his job at Moscow’s Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding, geneticist Dmitry Belyaev resolved to continue his forbidden work at a research institute in Siberia, designing a covert genetic experiment on the silver fox Vulpes vulpes, a color variant of the familiar red fox.
Belyaev and his students began their study by carefully observing 130 silver foxes for their interactions with humans. Only the tamest—the foxes that remained still when approached and didn’t attack their human handlers—were allowed to breed. Belyaev’s hypothesis: by selectively breeding for tameness, he could produce heritable changes in behavior to recapitulate the domestication of wild canines.
Fifty years later, the silver foxes at the Siberian Institute of Cytology and Genetics are as tame as dogs. They wag their tails and whine when humans approach; they jump into researchers’ arms and try to lick their faces. These behaviors are hard-wired: tame foxes have tame offspring, and when aggressive foxes raise the offspring of tame foxes, the pups stay tame.
But “friendliness” wasn’t the only change. Though Belyaev’s foxes were selected for tameness, other changes soon followed: piebald coats, floppy ears, curly tails. Subtler changes, too—shorter snouts and smaller skulls, a longer developmental window for social bonding—physical effects with surprising relations to behavior, all compressed into about 40 vulpine generations.
We typically think of evolution working with sandpaper or a fine-tooth comb—incremental changes, accumulating slowly over millenia. What’s astonishing about Belyaev’s silver foxes is how everything happened at once, and fast, both behavioral changes and seemingly unrelated ones. It’s possible that these alterations came about through a huge number of genetic mutations, each affecting different traits. But it seems more likely, given the rapidity of change, that a small number of genetic changes had major physiological effects.
There are other examples of wide-acting genes like those that tamed the silver fox. Major changes in the course of the domestication of maize from teosinte, its wild ancestor, were driven by mutations in a single gene that inverted the structure of the corn kernel’s casing to expose its fleshy interior. Centuries after Darwin collected his famous Galapagos finches, researchers have found a protein whose timing and levels of expression alter beak size. Increasingly, our picture of nature suggests that natural selection acts on living things in unexpected ways, with a change in a single gene sometimes driving large-scale alterations, and other times fine-tuning what’s already there.
The organization of our genes might explain how large physiological changes arise. The complexity of living things may seem to suggest that they are brittle and precarious, like a game of Jenga where the smallest mutation can bring the tower toppling down. From this perspective, major evolutionary changes would seem to require painstakingly precise, minute alterations.
But instead, it seems that living things are organized to tolerate and even promote change. Biological processes are often modularized, and through many levels of hierarchical regulation, small refinements in key genes—like changes in the location and timing of expression—can make large-scale rearrangements while preserving core functions.
In animals, for instance, a group of genes called the “Hox cluster” determines where body parts form. By simply changing where these genes are expressed, scientists have engineered mutant fruit flies with fully formed legs in place of their antennae. It seems like living things have evolved to become evolvable, their very organization suited to change and adaptability.
As for the friendly foxes, recent studies have begun to associate tameness with a particular segment of the fox genome, a region also linked to domestication in dogs. Research suggests that the changes in Belyaev’s foxes may stem from hormones that control both stress and the timing of development, explaining the retention of juvenile traits like floppy ears. But we’re far from unraveling exactly what these hormones do, let alone their far-reaching effects. For now, the story of the tame silver foxes is still evolving.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 2
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that geneticist Dmitry Belyaev conducted research on silver foxes in the mid-19th century. In fact, he worked in the mid-20th century.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frequent use of the analgesic medicines ibuprofen and acetaminophen has been found to increase the likelihood of hearing loss in women, particularly for those under fifty years of age according to a recent study published by researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Scientists suggest that these drugs—which are marketed under brand names Advil, Motrin, and Tylenol among others—may reduce blood flow to the cochlea, our primary hearing organ, and impair its function. They also posit that these drugs could disrupt the body’s mechanisms to protect the cochlea from damage.
“We previously found that men who used these medications regularly had an increased risk for developing hearing loss,” said Sharon E. Curhan, head researcher of the study and instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “However, this relation had not yet been examined in women, who use these medications even more frequently than men.”
Curhan and other researchers discovered this association between analgesics and hearing loss in women through a 14-year study conducted at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital from 1995 to 2009.
In the study, 62,261 women aged 31 to 48 years old were observed for their use of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin. By the end of 14 years, 10,012 women had self-reported experiencing hearing loss.
Findings revealed that while ibuprofen and acetaminophen were associated with hearing loss, aspirin did not have an effect.
Upon further analysis, researchers found that those who used the medicines two or three times per week had more than a 10 percent higher risk for hearing loss than those who used them less than once a week.
For women taking the medicines up to four or five days a week, the risk of developing hearing loss jumped to 21 percent.
Hearing loss is an extremely common, and often disabling, chronic condition, Curhan said. It may have a negative impact on an individual’s communication, social life, and productivity.
According to previous research, in the U.S. alone up to one-third of women in their fifties and two-thirds of women in their sixties have experienced some degree of hearing loss.
“A great take-home message is that even though these analgesics are widely available in drugstores and supermarkets without a prescription, they are still medications and they have potential side effects,” Curhan said.
“It is important to take them mindfully.”

Professor David S. Jones ’97 is the A. Bernard Ackerman Professor of the Culture of Medicine and this year he is teaching a new, wildly popular class entitled Ethical Reasoning 33: “Medical Ethics and History.”  In his most recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, he explores the evolution of therapeutics from the days of blood-letting to what we see today.
The Harvard Crimson: In your article in the NEJM you state that therapeutic skepticism drove the therapeutic revolutions in the past. What do you think is the skepticism issue of our time?
David S. Jones:  The biggest problem facing physicians now isn’t lack of good treatments for particular diseases. The big challenge is getting the treatment we have in the hands of the patients who need them, and doing so in a way that is efficient and respectful of the costs involved. There are all sorts of different facts that people have for this problem, but on average across disease categories half of patients aren’t getting the treatments that they need that physicians have already discovered. There is certainly always room for people to discover new and better treatments going forward—what we really need right now is new and better ways to deliver.
THC: What got you interested in studying the history of science?
DSJ: I had been a history of science major as an undergraduate, many years ago, but I wasn’t at all interested in history of medicine. At that time, I had made a point of avoiding history of medicine altogether. I think one of the things that interests me, especially when I started medical school, was the very narrowed, focused scientific perspective that was emphasized. You had to learn anatomy, you had to learn biochemistry, you had to learn all this stuff—often it felt like it was a step removed from the experience of the patients and also wasn’t directly referable to the real challenges of providing good healthcare. It’s one thing to have great treatments, but if you don’t have good relations with your patients or you don’t have good healthcare delivery systems, or you don’t understand what barriers exist in people’s lives outside of the clinic, those are the things that deliver treatment. I really found that it was the social sciences—it was history, anthropology, or sociology—that can often produce perspectives that are generally neglected by physicians but can make a huge difference to what physicians actually deduce.
THC: You are teaching a very popular new class this semester Ethical Reasoning 33: Medical Ethics and History. What do you want your students to get out of this class?
DSJ: It’s a course that’s in the Gen. Ed. Program, so what I want students to get out of it is what the Gen. Ed. Program wants students to get out of these classes, which a recognition of how scholarly attention to some problem that we study in the classroom has relevance to the world outside the classroom. Presumably all of the students in the class have seen doctors in their lives and all of them will see doctors between now and until they die and all of them have parents, grandparents, relatives who interact with the healthcare system. Anyone who interacts with the healthcare system encounters the various ethical dilemmas that are inherent in healthcare, and so by helping these students think through these problems now,  by showing them how philosophers, historians, and social scientists approach these problems, the hope is that they will be able to better think about these problems in the future whether they encounter them as patients or whether they encounter them as physicians.
THC: What advice would you give to students interested in medical ethics and history of science?
DSJ: Major in history of science! Not as many people have gone into serious social studies of medicine since many people have gone into basic science. There are loads of interesting things about disease, about health care that have only begun to be studied. So there are loads of opportunities for people who develop the expertise in history or sociology or anthropology to make real contributions, not just to history or anthropology but to the questions of how we understand the causes of disease, how we design healthcare systems and what we can do to improve the experience of patients. So there are really wonderful opportunities for people who are interested in these questions.

As an undergraduate studying Visual and Environmental Studies, Matt R. Saunders ’97 spent his evenings in the Harvard Film Archive in the basement of the Carpenter Center. Now a visiting lecturer in the department, Saunders’s work has become part of a celebration of the building’s 50th anniversary with an exhibition there of his own.
Saunders’ exhibit opened with a reception and first screening on Thursday evening at the Archive. The exhibition, which runs through Nov. 4, combines painting, photography, and film. According to Carpenter Center Interim Director David N. Rodowick, who is also the chair of the VES department, Saunders’ exhibit is one of the several events this year that will commemorate the building’s anniversary.
Saunders, whose interest in film began when he visited the Archive as an undergraduate, designed the exhibit to use the Archive’s space cohesively with a three-part display. Saunders said his work is even less of an exhibit and more of a series of work that reflects what is happening at the Archive.
“What I wanted to do was not a show,” Saunders said. “I teach here, and I felt strange just showing my work in the lobby.… I wanted to use the space organically.”
The first part of Saunders’ work is print art shown in the Archive’s display cases. A combination of painting and photography, the work is, according to Saunders, “painted images used to expose photographic paper.” The printed display will change weekly according to what films are showing at the Archive.
Saunders’ exhibit also includes two displays of his individual paintings in short film clips. Saunders created the film by scanning several of his paintings and assembling them digitally.
One clip, made of black and white paintings inspired by a lake in Berlin, is projected underneath the staircase leading down to the Archive. The second clip, titled “China in Nixon,” will be shown on weekdays in the Archive Lecture Hall from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. The screenings are free to students.
For the building’s anniversary, Rodowick wanted this year’s programming to connect to the building in some way. Saunders’ idea, Rodowick said, uses the building itself as a form of artwork.
“[In the Archive,] normally students see photographs down there, you see film, but suddenly this is a way of activating the space and asking people to look at the space in a different way,” Rodowick said.
Rodowick also praised Saunders’ exhibit for its variety.
“What’s wonderful about Matt’s work…[is] how varied it is,” Rodowick said. “In Matt’s case, it’s not only a painting, or only a photograph, or only animation; it’s all of these things working together.”

A typical Harvard course may host renowned authors, environmentalists, and politicians from around the world, but the speakers featured in Thursday’s Sociology 149: “Inequality, Poverty, and Wealth in Comparative Perspective” spend most of their time on the streets right outside the campus gates.
These speakers, three members of Cambridge’s homeless population, were invited by Sociology Lecturer Patrick Hamm to share their experiences of poverty with the students in his class—a study of the sources and consequences of inequality in America.
“It was very unexpected,” said Siu “Andy” O. Lau, a visiting student from Hong Kong who attended Hamm’s class.
Hamm was inspired to give this lecture in part by his personal interactions with the homeless near his home in Back Bay. He befriended Thursday’s speakers—Rennell, Destry, and a man who asked to be identified by his middle name “Davy”—long before he planned to teach the course.
They are only three of an estimated 2.3 to 3.5 million people who are homeless during a given year, according to recent data by the National Coalition for the Homeless.
Davy, a bearded man with elaborate tattoos along his neck, usually sits outside the Harvard Book Store.
“The worst thing about being homeless is the loneliness, and having nowhere to go,” he said.  “There’s no handbook to being homeless; you’re simply out there like an animal.”
Davy, who became homeless at age 16 in Scotland, said he thinks that people in America are more aware of the homeless than in other nations, but Rennell, a spunky middle-aged woman, said she often feels dismissed.
She described moments when passersby told her that she doesn’t look hungry, or that her new tennis shoes indicate that she doesn’t need help.
“But what is a homeless person supposed to look like?” she asked in exasperation.
The speakers’ stories illuminated how homelessness occurs unexpectedly, and is a vicious cycle that’s difficult to break.
“I never thought I would be holding the cup,” Rennell said.
However, all three remain hopeful for the years ahead.
Destry, who said he became homeless in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, told the class he’s preparing himself for a future free from homelessness. He offered words of advice to the class.
“You all just stay positive and try to be the future,” he said.
Rennell looks forward to owning her own house. She thinks that the American government should provide better systems for the homeless to repair foreclosed homes for themselves or work for better residences.
Beyond food and shelter, the speakers said they yearn most for kind human interaction that can be hard to find on the street.
“Sometimes conversation is better than money, to know you’re part of the world,” Rennell said.
Their message resonated with the students in the class, who all rushed at the end of lecture to introduce themselves to the speakers.
“[Their stories] are definitely something more people need to hear,” said Andrew D. Kim ’16. “Homelessness is something we see everyday, but it’s become part of the background.”
“It was definitely the best class of the year so far,” said Sietse K. Goffard ’15.  “I will never forget it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,  a famous Burmese political dissident imprisoned for nearly 15 years, visited Harvard Thursday bringing tidings of democracy in Myanmar and a reminder for students.
“You are free in this university to lead your life as you please,” Suu Kyi, who was released from house arrest in 2010, told the crowd at a ticketed John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event. “This is what very many students fail to recognize—how free they are, how they have been given freedom of choice on a daily basis, how they have been given the chance to shape their lives as they would like it to shape up.”
Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Congressional Gold Medalist, is touring the United States for the first time in 40 years. Suu Kyi came to Cambridge after stops in New York City and in Washington D.C., where she spoke with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
At the Institute of Politics on Thursday, Suu Kyi discussed her plan for preparing the people of Myanmar, previously known as Burma, to be active participants in civil society following recent democratic victories there.
“Change has started coming to Burma. But we have not yet seen the fruits of this change,” she said. “We have started out on the road of democratization, and as we go along this road, we have to prepare our people to be citizens of a free society.”
Suu Kyi has spent much of her adult life fighting for democracy in Myanmar. She is a founding member and the current chairperson of the National League for Democracy, an oppositional party that has fought the military dictatorship in Myanmar for 24 years. Suu Kyi’s party won 43 of the 45 vacant parliament seats earlier this year. In two years, Suu Kyi has risen from political prisoner to member of Parliament.
But Suu Kyi said she is not out for revenge for those military officials who kept her prisoner for many years.
“I for one am not keen on retribution. Even if we go for justice, it has to be restorative justice,” she said.
During the question and answer session following her speech, Suu Kyi was asked about her emotions when she faced the choice to leave her country or be placed under house arrest.
“I never thought there was a choice. I never thought of leaving Burma. I always thought that as long as there was one person who believed in democracy in Burma, I had to stay with that person,” Suu Kyi responded.
The lucky students who won tickets to the event were struck by Suu Kyi’s persistence and commitment to bringing democracy to Myanmar.
“I think the way that she spoke was inspiring and soothing, and it was great to see that she is such a humble person,” said Tiffany A. Lazo-Cedre ’16, who participated in the question and answer session with Suu Kyi.
Suu Kyi’s address was the most recent installment of the Godkin Lectures, described as the “most prestigious endowed lecture series at Harvard” by Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Harvard employees and supporters gathered Thursday afternoon for four “Stand-Out” events to show solidarity for the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers’ ongoing contract negotiations.
HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 non-faculty Harvard staff, held outdoor demonstrations outside of the Museum of Natural History, the Holyoke Center, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Taubman building, and the Countway Library in the Longwood Medical Area.
According to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, official union headcounts put total attendance at all four rallies at more than 1200 workers and supporters.
The union billed the event as a chance for staff to stand together, literally, rather than march, chant, or give speeches. Jaeger said that the demonstrations’ purpose was twofold: first, to give workers and supporters a chance to show their “spirited determination to have the negotiations go in a better direction” and second, to inform the community, including Harvard and its neighbors, and ask them to stand with HUCTW.
Jaeger said HUCTW members’ unity made standing an appropriate form of demonstration.
“Our members are really connected to each other and to the organization...so I think our goal today wasn’t to get our members fired up,” Jaeger said. “Our members are fairly fired up. I think what we did today is what our members wanted to do—which is to express themselves individually and collectively.”
The contract that currently governs the relationship between HUCTW members and the University was originally set to expire over the summer; however, union and University negotiators were unable to agree on new terms.
Jaeger said that there has been “no significant progress” with negotiations recently.
“We’re continuing to meet, but it’s not fruitful at this point,” he said.
The union and University have found themselves at odds over health care benefits and salary increases during contract negotiation sessions.
Susan M. Kinsella, an administrative coordinator in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department who demonstrated outside of the Kennedy School on Thursday, said wages need to be adjusted sufficiently to keep pace with inflation.
“Everybody has an individual story of how the lack of a contract is affecting them,” Kinsella said. “One would think that only three months wouldn’t make that much difference, but I have to set aside more money to live, because prices are going up, if my salary is not increasing.”
In a statement released by the Harvard Gazette Thursday, the University stated that wage offers made by the University in negotiations with HUCTW were “clearly consistent with the internal and external job markets.”
In the statement, the University pointed to the nearly $2 billion it invests in employee compensation each year and stated that its pay to HUCTW members was “very competitive” according to benchmark comparisons with the external market.
The statement said that a volatile global economy contributed to increased pressure on University revenue sources which would have “long-lasting implications for the University’s finances.”
Justin F. Lefler, an IT field technician at Harvard Business School who participated in the action outside the Kennedy School, said that he hoped that the rallies would help yield fair health care benefits for the workers.
“We’re an important cog in the wheel that keeps this University going,” Lefler said. “We’re hoping this will help people realize how many people are being harmed by this.”

Though the carvings on the 27-ton marble stele nestled between Boylston Hall and Widener Library have begun to fade, a team of Harvard researchers have set out to digitally preserve this inscription commemorating Harvard’s 300th anniversary.
Since last week, workers have worked nightly to scan and capture 3D images of the details of the statue’s carvings. The scanning team works nightly from 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. to ensure an environment of high contrast for use of optical halogen lights.
The statue, also known as the Harvard Bixi, came to the Yard in 1936, when a group of Chinese Harvard alumni procured the 17-foot high, 27-ton marble stele and moved it from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing. The statue stands in front of Boylston Hall, which formerly served as the East Asian Languages building.
Over the years, acid rain and exposure to the elements have faded the inscriptions on the statue.
Proposals to move the Bixi indoors have proved impossible as few building floors can withstand the stele’s weight of 27 tons, according to Jeffrey R. Williams ’78, the executive director of the Harvard Center Shanghai and head of the research team.
The team, tapping into the expertise of researchers from the Peabody Museum’s Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions program, has paid special attention to documenting the statue’s inscription.
The inscription on the stele reads in Chinese: “On this, the occasion of the tercentenary of the founding of our alma mater, we show our gratitude for the nurturing and inspiration we received here. Henceforth, we hope to witness the further enlargement and expansion of an ever-increasing cultural interchange between our two countries, enabling the prosperity of the nation to follow the path of advanced learning. Of this ideal we shall remain ever mindful.”
Williams joined forces with the Harvard China Fund, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Campus Services, and the Fogg Museum to preserve the statue’s message.
“People need to understand what the stele represents,” Williams said. “It’s not just a random item that was found and brought over.”
Within the first week of the scanning, a tent was installed over the stele to reach upper areas not accessible at ground level.
“The 3D scanning work is almost complete,” said Barbara Fash, director of the Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions Program and Mesoamerican Laboratory. “The team had two nights off, due to rain and another event conflict, so they are two days behind. But otherwise, everything has been progressing steadily.”
All raw data and 3D models will be permanently accessioned into Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology Collection.
“It’s unfortunate that students walk by it for their four years at Harvard and never know what it is,” said Williams.
“I hope that we can work together to preserve this significant historical monument for future generations to appreciate.”

Environmental leaders and Harvard faculty gathered in Sanders Theatre Thursday afternoon to discuss Rachel Carson’s book, “Silent Spring”, and the future of environmentalism.
The panel of nine faculty and experts, organized around the 50th anniversary of the publication of Carson’s book, included Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke, as well Bill McKibben, author of “The End of Nature” and the activist behind 350.org, a climate change group.
Carson’s “Silent Spring,” published in 1962, two years before her death, is often noted as the start of the environmentalist movement.
Ten years later, the book was widely credited for the federal ban on DDT, a toxic pesticide widely used in the 1940s and 1950s.
Daniel P. Schrag, a professor of geology and director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment who organized the event, called Carson’s work a “plea for a change in the course of human history.”
He added that Silent Spring introduced “a lot of lessons for the future,” noting that “[Silent Spring] is about morality as well as pesticides.”
The panel focused on how Carson’s work continues to be relevant to today’s environmental challenges.
Speaking of Carson’s legacy, Beinecke said, “she was a fearless woman…a moral crusader of her time.”
“Fifty years on we very much live in Rachel Carson’s world,” McKibben said. She was the “first person to knock the shine off modernity,” he said.
Today, McKibben said, scary statistics “force us to make choices as citizens. Our response has to boil down to the notion that we are more than simply self-interested.” The solution, he said, is “action on all fronts.”
McKibben put that responsibility specifically on the Harvard community. “The onus is all the more on [university] communities to be taking the lead and making some kind of sacrifice,” he said. “We need to make sure college campuses are central places for this fight to be held.”
Nina Sokolovic '14 attended the discussion to hear a “broader perspective” on a topic she had covered in a class taught by John  D. Spengler, a professor of environmental health at the School of Public Health who was also a member of the panel.
Chloe S. Maxmin '15 said the discussion was “fantastic.”
“It was really powerful how the panelists related Rachel Carson’s message back to divestment,” Maxmin said. The takeaway for her, Maxmin said, was “investing money in ways that don’t threaten the environment.”

President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the first woman to be elected president of Argentina, faced tough questions from students at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
Delivering her speech in Spanish, Kirchner argued that her administration has largely been a successful one. She noted accomplishments such as the establishment of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Productive Innovation and the recovery of Argentina after both the 2008 economic crisis and the recent European sovereign-debt crisis.
“The minimum wage of our workers is the highest in Latin America,” said Kirchner, whose speech was translated for English speakers. “The same-sex marriage law—we take pride in being the first country in Latin America. To do this fills us with joy,” she added.
Kirchner was first elected president of Argentina in 2007 and then again in 2011. She followed her husband Néstor Carlos Kirchner, who had served as president from 2003 to 2007.
The hopeful tenor of her address, however, stood in stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that  ensued. During the question and answer session, students, many of whom were of Argentine, El Salvadorian, Venezuelan, or other Hispanic descent, grilled Kirchner and pressed her to respond to allegations.
Kirchner gave an unwavering defense of her presidential administration, which has often been lambasted by the Argentine press, but students repeatedly asked the Argentine president to be more “self-critical,” as one audience member put it.
“I feel highly privileged to be one of the few Argentines who can actually ask you a question,” said another audience member, referring to the acrimonious relationship between Kirchner and the press. Many claimed that Kirchner has been very unresponsive to the media and that she neglects to respond to concerns from her constituents.
“We’re at Harvard. Come on, please. Those things are not from Harvard,” Kirchner responded, according to the translation.
“If I didn’t talk to people, then why did they re-elect me with over 54 percent of the vote? You’ve got academic standards. You can’t repeat what two or three journalists write. Let’s stop talking about what the media says. Because now it’s an opposition media,” she added.
In light of this criticism, Kirchner refused to let Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 end the question and answer session and instead encouraged the students lined up at the microphones to continue asking their questions.
Other students came to the podium and asked her about claims that her personal wealth had drastically increased during her tenure in office.
“I don’t know where you got that from but that’s not the case. I have a certain economic position which is the result of working all my life as a successful lawyer. And now I’m a successful president,” answered Kirchner.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 3
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Néstor Carlos Kirchner was barred from running for president of Argentina in 2007 after his first term in office ended. In fact, he voluntarily stepped down after one term, and his wife then ran for the presidency.

Robert J. Reardon, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, discussed the effectiveness of various foreign policy strategies for addressing nuclear proliferation in Iran on Thursday afternoon at the International Security Program’s first brown bag seminar of the year.
Nearly 50 professors, students, and other Harvard Kennedy School affiliates attended Reardon’s seminar, “Containing Iran: Why the Taboo Policy of Containment May Be the Right One,” in the Belfer Center Library.
Reardon, a specialist in nuclear nonproliferation policy, received his Ph.D. in political science from MIT and served as a nuclear security fellow at the Rand Corporation’s Washington office before coming to the Belfer Center.
Reardon began by pointing out misconceptions about the strategy of containment, the definition of which he thinks has been distorted in America’s political dialogue.
Reardon defined a strategy of containment as “preserving the status quo and preventing aggression rather than directly challenging or attacking an adversary.” He said that his research focuses on methods of positive inducement and coercion to encourage Iran to end its nuclear program.
“Iran has crossed a technological threshold [in that] acquiring weapons becomes a political question much more than a technological one,” Reardon said in his presentation.
While some in the U.S. and Israel have called for military strikes to take out Iran’s nuclear facilities, Reardon explained that he believes this is a delaying tactic instead of a real solution.
In an interview after his presentation, Reardon said that politicians have turned Iran into “an extremely urgent issue in that the U.S. has to act in the very short term to avoid catastrophic consequences.” But he suggested that the imminence of this threat has been exaggerated because “it’s easy to make political hay out of it.”
The seminar was based off of Reardon’s book of a similar name—“Containing Iran: Strategies for Addressing the Iranian Nuclear Challenge”—which was released on Thursday by the Rand Corporation. Reardon’s presentation was the first in this academic year’s series of weekly seminars put on by the International Security Program’s fellows.
According to Susan Lynch, the program assistant for the International Security Program, the lunches can be a chance for fellows to receive feedback on ongoing or recently completed projects.
“He took on a controversial issue and I think he did a good job,” said Annie Tracy Samuel, a second-year research fellow at the Belfer Center. “But with this sort of issue there are always more questions to consider.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Vatican joined a growing number of skeptics Friday in questioning the authenticity of a recently unveiled piece of papyrus said to demonstrate some early Christians believed that Jesus Christ was married. The fourth century fragment, which Harvard Divinity School professor Karen L. King unveiled last week, has come under increasing scrutiny as experts—and now the church newspaper—have called it a fabrication.
“Substantial reasons would lead one to conclude that the papyrus is indeed a clumsy forgery," an editorial in the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano read Friday.
"In any case, it's a fake," the editorial, penned by editor Gian Maria Vian concluded.
King revealed the previously unknown fragment of papyrus, dubbed “The Gospel of Jesus’s Wife,” at an academic conference in Rome last week. The fragment, dated to be from the fourth century, contains seven abbreviated lines written in the early Egyptian Christian language Coptic. The fourth line of text reads: “Jesus said to them, my wife...”
King’s finding immediately stirred debate within Coptic academic community and the Roman Catholic Church, which has long said Jesus was not married. While King cautioned that the fragment did prove definitively that Jesus was married, she said it did show that Jesus’s relationship status was a matter of debate among early Christians.
“Christian tradition has long held that Jesus was not married, even though no reliable historical evidence exists to support that claim,” King said in a statement last week. “This new gospel doesn’t prove that Jesus was married, but it tells us that the whole question only came up as part of vociferous debates about sexuality and marriage.”
Now, even that claim is under fire. The Vatican editorial discrediting the find comes days after a Coptic scholar at Durham University published a paper titled ‘The Gospel of Jesus’s Wife: How a fake Gospel-Fragment was composed.’ In that paper, Durham professor Francis Watson argues that the fragment-—which King and researchers say likely comes from a new gospel—borrows heavily from the Gospel of Thomas. Both gnostic texts are written in Coptic.
Specifically, Watson pointed to four words of phrases found in the Gospel of Thomas that have been rearranged and set in new contexts in the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife.
“The compiler has used a ‘collage’ or ‘patchwork’ compositional technique, and this level of dependence on extant pieces of Coptic text is more plausibly attributed to a modern author, with limited facility in Coptic, than to an ancient one,” Watson wrote in his article.
Other Coptic experts have raised questions about the unusual handwriting and grammatical mistakes in the text, according to Janet A. Timbie, an expert in Coptic language and literature at the Catholic University of America. All of which points to the likelihood that the text itself was fabricated sometime in the 20th or 21st century, she said.
“Getting a piece of old papyrus and writing on it is easy,” Timbie said. “And without further analysis, it is difficult to evaluate the document.”
Though King said the papyrus itself was thoroughly vetted and authenticated by outside experts, the ink has not yet been tested. She previously said she plans to publish her findings in a paper in January, after the ink of the text is authenticated. King did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The owner of the fragment has chosen to remain anonymous.
“Dr. King’s ‘marriage fragment’ paper, which Harvard Theological Review is planning to publish in its January, 2013, edition—if testing of the ink and other aspects of the fragment are completed in time—will include her responses to the vigorous and appropriate academic debate engendered by discovery of the fragment, as well as her report on the ink analysis, and further examination of the fragment,” a statement released by the Divinity School said Wednesday.
If authentic, scholars say the fragment could reignite a debate in the Church over the role of women and married men in the priesthood. The text later reads, “She will be able to be my disciple.” Church canon has long justified its policies by stating that Jesus was unmarried.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After going winless against Ancient Eight opponents last season, there is no better time than the present for the Harvard men’s soccer team to bounce back in the Ivy League.
After battling through the two most difficult weekends of an already challenging non-conference schedule, the squad looks to make a fresh start Saturday night as it faces rival Yale in its first match of Ivy play. The Crimson (1-5-1) will welcome the Bulldogs (3-4-2) to Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium in its first contest underneath its home lights this season.
Harvard has the upper hand against the Bulldogs in recent history, besting Yale in five of the last six match-ups. But the Crimson’s lone loss in that streak is still fresh in its memory, as it fell, 1-0, last year to the Bulldogs in its Ancient Eight opener. Unable to bounce back from an early goal despite strong offensive pressure, Harvard gave up its bragging rights with the loss. It is eager to earn them back this weekend and to start Ivy play off on the right foot.
“We’re treating this game as our biggest game of the year,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “When we play Yale it’s more of a battle than a soccer game. It’s about who can give that extra effort to come out on top.”
Both teams enter the match-up coming off close contests against top-ranked opponents, with the Crimson falling, 1-0, to No. 3 UC Santa Barbara on Sunday afternoon and Yale losing, 2-0, to No. 2 Connecticut on Tuesday night. With each Ivy squad holding its own against a talented opponent, both teams enter Saturday’s match with a growing sense of confidence to add fuel to the rivalry.
“Everything before now has been preparation for the Ivy League,” Friedman said. “That’s why we scheduled such a tough non-conference schedule.”
Harvard has also had its turn against the Huskies this season, but with less promising results, falling, 6-0, two weekends ago on Sep. 14 to then No. 3/4 Connecticut. Though the goal differential against their common opponent favors the Bulldogs, the Crimson has renewed confidence in its abilities after its improved game-play against the similarly ranked Gauchos this Sunday.
But Harvard is aware that the defensive strength of Yale should not be underestimated. While both offenses have netted five goals thus far in their schedules, the Crimson has allowed 14 goals in seven matches, giving up six more than the Bulldogs’ defense in two fewer contests. Two of the Bulldogs’ victories have come from shutouts this season, while Harvard’s lone clean sheet came in its single win of the schedule against Michigan State on Sep. 7.
Yet it remains to be seen whether the Crimson’s current losing record will be an indicator of its chances against Ivy League opponents. Harvard coach Carl Junot aimed to challenge his team when designing its non-conference schedule, filling it with consistently top-ranked teams such as the Huskies and the Gauchos to prepare the Crimson for Ancient Eight play. This weekend, Harvard will face its first test to see if Junot’s plan was successful.
“So far our results have not been really good but since the beginning of the season we’ve decided to peak and focus on the Ivy League games,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said. “The past three games we’ve played have been against top teams so I think we’re definitely ready.”
Co-captain Scott Prozeller, senior Zack Wolfenzon, Kobayashi, and freshmen Jake Freeman and Oliver White have all netted goals for the Crimson this season, leading a balanced offense going into the team’s first Ivy match. Rookies Evan Mendez and Joe Festa have shared goaltending duties this season, with Mendez receiving red cards in two of the five matches he’s started. Festa currently holds the better goals-against average at 1.86 and a .727 save percentage.
Harvard will face a talented Yale squad led by junior forward Peter Jacobson, who has posted 18 shots on goal thus far this season. Jacobson will be supported by freshman forward Mitch Wagner, sophomore midfielder Peter Ambiel, and senior midfielder Tony Wilbar, whom Yale coach Brian Tompkins said had breakout performances in the team’s match against the Huskies. Senior goalkeeper Bobby Thalman will pose a challenge for the Crimson in the net, currently second in the league with 41 saves and a .837 save percentage.
In the all-time series, Harvard leads 51-37-10 against Yale. The Crimson aims to add to this stretch and snap its winless Ivy streak, setting the tone for the remainder of its Ivy schedule.
“For us, the season starts now,” Friedman said. “Now this is the test to win the Ivy League championship and it starts on Saturday, that’s the way we’re treating it and we’re ready to beat Yale at home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 45-31 victory over Brown last Saturday, the Harvard football team extended its winning streak to 11 games, the longest in the Football Championship Series.
On Friday night under the lights at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson will look to push that streak to 12 against the team that it last fell to, the Holy Cross Crusaders.
“Being in front of the home crowd is an unreal atmosphere. We’re excited, ready to go and keep the streak alive,” said senior running back Treavor Scales.
When the two teams squared off last season, the Crusaders (0-3) outplayed Harvard (2-0, 1-0 Ivy), capitalizing on Crimson turnovers and scoring 27 straight points en route to a 30-22 win.
This year, Harvard enters the annual contest against Holy Cross as the favorite. In its past two games, the Crusaders have faltered in the fourth quarter in losses to Brown and Dartmouth.
On Sept. 15, Bears quarterback Patrick Donnelly lifted his team from an 11-point deficit in the fourth with 75- and 84-yard touchdown drives. A week later, Dartmouth kicker Riley Lyons sealed the Crusaders’ defeat with a 31-yard field goal in the last second of the game.
Holy Cross’ recent inability to hold onto a lead late into the game forms a stark contrast with a Harvard offense that has been dominant in the final minutes. The Crimson has had a combined six touchdowns in the fourth quarters of its games against Brown and the University of San Diego, four of which came from Scales.
“The fourth quarter is a special thing for me, apparently…. We just find another gear as an offense,” Scales said. “We realize that it’s our last chance to put up points on the board, so we try to take advantage of it.”
Scales, who in each of the past two weeks has won at least a share of the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week accolade, has been a powerhouse thus far. Averaging 154.5 rushing yards through two games, he has played an integral role in the success of the Harvard offense, as has senior quarterback Colton Chapple, who passed for 351 yards last week.
And for the second straight week, Scales and the Crimson will line up against a strong opposing defensive line.
“They are a much improved defensive team from a year ago,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They are a team that’s been on the field a good deal because their offense hasn’t generated a lot of points or yardage.”
Senior linebacker Roman SanDoval leads the Crusaders defensively. SanDoval has a team-best 32 total tackles this season, including three tackles for loss and one sack.
Up front on the line, junior defensive ends Gary Acquah and Mike Tucker have posted 19 and six tackles this season, respectively. Acquah, who was the top defensive lineman for the Crusaders with 40 tackles last season, made six tackles in the game against Dartmouth and is expected to be a force this weekend.
“Nobody’s blocked him yet; nobody’s come close to blocking him yet,” Murphy said.
“The front seven is definitely something that we’ve focused on.... Making sure that everyone up front is blocked is a priority,” Scales added. “We’re looking to do the same things that we’re always doing: just taking what the defense gives us, whether it be spreading out, throwing the ball, or running the ball down the field.”
Offensively, the Crusaders have struggled, averaging 16 points per contest, and neither its running game nor its passing attack has gained much traction. After the graduation of long-time starting quarterback from a year ago in addition to the loss of this year’s starter, Kevin Watson, sophomore Ryan Laughlin has been forced to step in. In his debut, Laughlin completed 21 of his 30 passes for just 106 yards in the team’s loss to Dartmouth.
Senior Gerald Mistretta and junior Mike Fess lead the team’s receiving corps, having combined for 35 receptions and 289 receiving yards between the two. 
Though the Crimson enters the contest favored, the team acknowledges the challenge ahead against a Crusaders squad which has come away with close defeats in each of its past two games.
“Regardless of their record, you know you see it on paper, but you really look into it with the stats…how they lost those two games,” Scales said. “You know that you’re expecting a tough team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a close loss to Penn in its first conference game last week, Harvard (3-3-2, 0-1 Ivy) is looking to rebound on Saturday when it faces rival Yale (5-4, 0-1 Ivy) at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium at 12:00 p.m.
Harvard is looking to pick up its first win in three games, coming off of a Wednesday 0-0 tie with Central Connecticut State University. On Saturday, the Crimson goes for its first home win of the season after losing and drawing two matches at Soldiers Field Stadium thus far.
In preparation for this weekend, Harvard has been practicing consistency in front of the goal. In its six games this season, the Crimson has struggled to capitalize on goal scoring opportunities, averaging 1.5 goals per game on 17 shots.
“We need to focus on working together,” sophomore midfielder Laura Aguilar said. “We’ve been practicing a lot on finishing in front of the goal, and that’s going to come with team-work and playing for each other.”
Although, the Bulldogs are coming off a 2-1 overtime loss to Princeton, in which a Yale defender unintentionally scored a winning own-goal for the Tigers,  the Bulldogs nonetheless have taken advantage of goal-scoring opportunities this season, averaging 2.1 goals per game on 12 shots. Yale’s offensive prowess has come from a number of players, most notably senior midfielder Kristen Forster, who leads the team with five goals.
Harvard is looking to bring intensity and energy to the game on Saturday. This season, the Crimson has been outscored 8-3 in first halves, so the team hopes to start strong and put the game away early.
“We’re not really concerned with what Yale does,” sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hambry said. “We’re just thinking about how we are going to play. We’ve been focusing on getting into a grove and really keeping our energy up.”
With the bulk of the conference schedule left to play, Harvard needs a win against the Bulldogs to gain momentum going into the remainder of the season.  Last weekend, the Crimson remained competitive with Penn until the final moments of the game, when Quaker defender Kaitlyn Moore netted a shot off of a corner kick with less than four seconds on the clock. Though the loss was the first for Harvard in Ivy-League play since 2010, the team remains unfazed.
“We’re a very resilient team,” Aguilar said. “We lost to Penn last weekend, but we’re not dwelling on that fact. We’re looking forward to our next challenge.”
The Crimson is confident about its performance this season, despite having failed to pick up a win in the last three games.
“We did well against Penn and CCSU,” Casscells-Hambry said. “We had a bunch of shots and our energy was really good.”
This season, Harvard has been strong defensively. With the exception of an 8-1 loss against Boston College earlier this month, the Crimson has only allowed five goals in seven games. A major contributor to this effort has been sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten.  Kanten owns a 76 percent save rate and shutouts against both Massachusetts and CCSU.
Defensively, the Bulldogs have allowed 11 goals this season, and have relied on three different goalkeepers. Freshman Rachel Ames has received the most playing time of the trio, and she holds the lowest goals against average at .97 goals per game.
Since 2008, Harvard has been a powerhouse in the Ivy League, winning championships in 2008, 2009, and 2011.  In the all-time series against Yale, the Crimson hold a 28-8-1 record, winning in their last four meetings. Despite its historical dominance of the Bulldogs, Harvard is holding nothing back in preparing for Saturday.
“We have had a lot of good practices this week, and I think that we have figured out a really good lineup,” Casscells-Hambry said. “Going in, we’re going to come in really strong. We’re really excited for the game.”
Veterans on the team remember last year’s hard-fought victory in the 93rd minute at New Haven, and they know that the Bulldogs will be competitive. Especially in light of last weekend’s loss to Penn, the Crimson knows that it has limited chances to get back on track.
“We only get to play each team once during the season,” Aguilar said. “This season the Ivy League is seven games and so each one obviously matters a lot. We treat every game like a championship game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team’s game against Holy Cross Friday night at Harvard Stadium shared few similarities with last year’s 30-22 Crusaders win.  The Crimson (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) offense could not be contained by the Holy Cross (0-4) defense or a steady rain, scoring a touchdown on each of its first seven possessions to finish the first half with a 49-3 lead and the game with a 52-3 win.
Harvard displayed its offensive firepower early, scoring just over two minutes into the game on a 10-yard strike from senior Colton Chapple to junior wideout Ricky Zorn. Zorn finished the half one yard shy of 100 yards receiving while Chapple threw for 260 yards and four scores.
“[Since] there wasn’t a lot of wind, there was no question we were going to throw the ball,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We take great pride in being able to play in any conditions.”
Chapple ran for another score before being pulled at halftime, while senior running back Treavor Scales, who ran for over 100 yards in each of the team’s first two games, added 82 yards in the first half.
Harvard’s 49 first-half points broke the school record, which dated back to 2005.
“It’s a credit to the guys up front, seeing as how we can do pretty much whatever we want, whether it be throwing the ball or running the ball,” Chapple said. “Keeping [the defense] on their toes is something that we were able to do in the first half.”
Holy Cross came out of the gates just as explosively, gaining 65 yards on its first play from scrimmage down to the Crimson 12.
But the Crusaders were unable to punch it in, eventually settling for a field goal. From that point on, Holy Cross gained only 26 yards and two first downs in the first half.
As dominant as Harvard was on offense and defense, its special teams play was equally impressive early on.
On the Crusaders’ first of nine punts, Crimson sophomore Connor Sheehan blew through the line and blocked the kick. Senior D.J. Monroe scooped the ball up and ran it back for a touchdown.
“Connor Sheehan is a kid who has a knack for that,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He has tremendous closing speed in a short space; he’s becoming a really huge special teams player for us.
“That [blocked punt] was the key play of the first half,” Murphy added. “It just really put us over the top.”
On Harvard’s final drive of the half, Murphy elected to send out backup running backs senior Rich Zajeski and freshman Paul Stanton Jr. instead of Scales.
The pair of replacements proved just as dynamic. Stanton started the drive with two rushes for 33 yards, and Zajeski finished it with a four-yard touchdown run. In between, Chapple connected with senior Kyle Juszczyk for a 51-yard gain.
The Harvard backups got more playing time in the second half as few Crimson starters saw the field.
Sophomore quarterback Connor Hempel led the team on a 58-yard drive that culminated in a field goal to start the second half.
Harvard did not score after that, as the offense played conservatively up 49 points. In the final few minutes of the contest, freshman signal caller Scott Hosch got time behind center as well.
Despite a lack of scoring, Stanton racked up nearly 80 yards on just eight carries and also returned a kickoff 42 yards on his first touch in college football.
“I went back and watched [Stanton’s] highlight film in the summer about 10 times saying, ‘I think this kid’s really good,’ and you know what? He’s really good,” Murphy said “He gave us a huge lift. He showed us he’s a real player at this level.”
While the Crimson offense cooled off, Harvard’s defense kept up its pressure for the entirety of the game.
Holy Cross’s best chance to score in the second half came early in the fourth quarter as the Crusaders drove the ball to within the Crimson’s five-yard line. After an incompletion and two thwarted running attempts, Holy Cross went for a touchdown on fourth down from the three, but a pressure-induced incompletion ended the threat.
The Crusaders’ starting signal caller was eventually pulled from the game but was put back in after the backup fumbled back-to-back snaps, the second of which was recovered by Harvard.
Holy Cross finished with just 191 yards offensively compared to the Crimson’s 520.

It's officially autumn, which means at this point you should have accepted the changing weather. But if not, here are some tracks brought to you by the Arts Board guaranteed to get you out of summer mode and ready for the season of cider, state fairs, and head colds.
"Autumn" – Joanna Newsom
Even though she takes a somewhat grim perspective on the coming of fall (“Driven through by her own sword / Summer died last night, alone”), this California harpist's orchestral, eight-minute ode to the season is a properly majestic way to welcome it in.
"Sometimes in the Fall" – Phoenix
Now that you’ve gotten over the death of summer, it’s time to cheer up. This hard-driving and syncopated Phoenix cut, which is probably about hooking up in autumn (it's always tough to tell with Phoenix), should set the tone well for your season.
"September in the Rain" – Frank Sinatra
Beats out Earth, Wind, and Fire’s better-known “September” by merit of its more Harvard-relevant meteorology. EWF's song claims there “never was a cloudy day,” which is clearly false to anyone who's spent time in Cambridge during the month. Instead, listen to Ol' Blue Eyes while skipping over the unbelievable number of puddles scattered around campus.
"October" – Jonas Alaska
Okay, so maybe this jaunty, acoustic track is actually a morbid tale about a bunch of people dying in a shipwreck—but to be fair, Jonas Alaska is from Norway , and that's pretty much what every Norwegian song is about.
"November" – Plume Giant
Even though the folk group Plume Giant is composed of three recent Yale graduates, let’s give credit where credit’s due, especially with regards to this sparse, perfectly harmonized track off the band’s 2012 debut LP Callithump. The gloomiest month of the year has never sounded more gorgeous.
"Autumn Music 2" and "On the Nature of Daylight" – Max Richter
With his dissonant violin-based pieces, Richter is the perfect modern composer for autumn—not too melancholy, not too cheesy. On a windy autumn morning, put on either of these songs and revel in your wistfulness.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
September 23, 1940: Council Asks Trial of Student Waiting
The following is a summary of the Student Council Report on Student Waiting prepared by a committee of eight undergraduates and adopted by the Student Council last June.
In its previous report the Student Council Committee on Board expressed the opinions that the members of the Houses are not receiving, a fair return for the present board charges and that better meals could be served at lower prices. Since it became clear during the course of this investigation that board rates might possibly be lowered by the partial substitution of students for waitresses, the Committees is issuing this supplementary report on student waiting. Nevertheless, it wishes to emphasize its belief that the question of student waiting is subordinate in importance to the remedying of the dining-hall inefficiency and waste pointed to by evidence in the first report.
The issues involved in student waiting are three-fold:
1. What effect would it have on board rates?
2. What are the arguments for an against it aside from this effect?
3. What is the altitude of House Masters and undergraduates toward student waiting?
September 23, 1946: Enrollment Reaches All-Time High
Today's expected total of 2,600 returning undergraduates will swell College enrollment figures to over 5,200, Registrar Sargent Kennedy '28 announced last night as he anxiously reviewed plans for accommodating the largest group of students in Harvard history.
Although the College population will materialize into a community well under last spring's predicted horde of some 5,500, the first meeting of classes on Wdnesday will still find many students harried by coming worries with a respectable handful sleeping, barracks style, in the Indoor Athletic Building.
Total University population is expected to crystallize at around 12,000 with the Law and Business Schools making up the bulk of the Graduate population.
Setember 26, 1966: Tradition Is Broken As Jews Hold High Holy Day Services in Mem Church 
The University has quietly reversed a long-standing tradition by permitting Jewish High Holy Days services to be held in Memorial Church. The blowing of the ram's horn at sundown Saturday ended the first non-Christian service open to the public in Mem Church's 35-year history.
The decision to permit the services was made this summer by the Rev. Charles Price, Preacher to the University after Rabbi Ben-Zion Gold of Hillel House told him that it was difficult to find a hall large enough to house the Reform services, one of three sets of services held for the Holy Days. Price said yesterday that he discussed the matter with President Pusey, but that the decision was his own. The question was not discussed at all by the Corporation, Sargent Kennedy, secretary to the Corporation, said last night.
September 26, 1969: Brass Tacks: The Cambridge Project
To understand the Cambridge Project, we have to go back a few years, to the Pentagon's first disastrous brush with the new social science. In 1964 a program under the quaint name of Camelot was launched by the Special Operations Research Office of the U.S. Army. Camelot's purpose. according to an official description was to devise procedures for assessing the potential for internal war within national societies; to identify with increased degrees of confidence, these actions which a government might take to relieve conditions which are assessed as giving rise to a potential for internal war; and to assess the feasibility of prescribing the characteristies of a system for obtaining and using the essential information needed for doing the above to things.
Translated back into English, Camelot was intchded to enlist social science data-gathering and model-building techniques in the service of America's global efforts to prevent social revolutions ("internal war"). The project was to concentrate on the Latin American countries, where left-wing insurgencies were getting to be a pretty scrious problem in the early 1960's, and a major field office was to be established in the region to co-ordinate data-gathering operations.
September 27, 1974: Room Thirteen: A Little Help From Their Friends
Late one night during registration week, a telephone rang in the basement of Stoughton Hall. A co-director of "Room 13"--a counseling, referral and information service run for and by Harvard students--picked up the receiver, only to hear a familiar voice.
She was a chronic caller. As usual, she had a lot to say: descriptions of her problems and fantasies; the ramblings of a lonely person.
Pat M. Booker '75, the co-director, listened to the caller. He asked her questions, listened, then asked more questions. He was willing to listen to all she said because that is Room 13's business. When he finally put down the receiver, he had spent seven hours talking with her.

UPDATED: 1:10 pm.
At approximately 11:07 a.m. on Friday, smoke could be seen emerging from the Fogg Art Museum, which is currently undergoing renovations. Crowds of people were standing outside the building and firefighters were responding to the scene.
A construction worker at the museum said that there was a fire. Another construction worker reported that the fire was simply a small ignition and that it was out by the time the fire department arrived. The evacuation, he said, was procedural. Fire trucks are no longer at the scene.
