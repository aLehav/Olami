After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Undergraduate Council voted to set aside $8,000 to subsidize summer storage for lower-income students who will live in houses that, according to the UC legislation, do not currently offer a free storage option. Recently, they voted to add an additional $2,000 for a total of $10,000 of allocated funding. This will provide students who are eligible for the Student Events Fund—a program in the College that covers the costs of event tickets for students with financial need—in Quincy, Dunster, Winthrop, Mather, and Leverett Houses with a $35 subsidy towards their overall summer storage costs.
That there are steps being taken to address these housing issues is a welcome sight. These problems have been long-standing: In the past, the UC has made pushes for the College to cover summer storage expenses for students in renovated houses. We have also previously called on the College to intervene in summer storage problems and supported increased funding from the University to subsidize summer storage for students on financial aid. It is unfortunate that students have had to deal with more financial and logistical burdens related to summer storage based on the happenstance of which house they were sorted into. This is especially true for low-income students, for whom the financial responsibility is more pronounced.
Although the UC’s attempt to soften this financial responsibility with a $35 subsidy is not nearly enough to actually ease this burden, it is a step in the right direction. As we have previously opined, we believe the University should take further steps in the future to eliminate this problem and to ensure that all students have equal access to summer storage, despite their House affiliation.
While we appreciate the UC’s efforts in ameliorating these costs, we are concerned by their handling of sensitive student information. Currently, interested students must fill out a Google document which requests their estimated level of financial aid from the College, the distance they live away from campus, proof of their SEF eligibility through a screenshot of the portal, and other personal details.
This system to collect private student financial information is risky; using a student’s personal Google Drive for private data leaves open the possibility of this information becoming public or being hacked, potentially putting students’ private information at risk. Students have already seen the dangers associated with private educational information—such as their grades and financial aid details—accidentally being open to the public. Having students submit sensitive information yet again through an insecure apparatus poses too much of a possibility for a similar situation to occur and should not be continued. Thus, the UC should be more careful in how they verify eligibility.
Overall, the UC’s allocation of funds to subsidize summer storage for lower-income students is a positive development, though we urge it to be more conscientious and sensitive to students’ personal financial information. Ultimately, more needs to be done to support low-income students: House placement should not determine whether one has to pay a hefty sum for summer storage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The interaction between the Harvard undergraduate and Cambridge police that occurred on April 13 highlighted several challenges we face as a Harvard community, a Cambridge community, and humanity. First, the incident highlighted the power of social media to immediately polarize populations by challenging people to choose a side when they only had initial and partial information. Second, and more importantly, it highlighted how the notion of personal accountability for our own actions seems to be a thing of the past.
While there are certainly elements of the interaction between the student and police that merit attention and further scrutiny, the disappointing piece of this story is the reaction of the administration and the community. In an email to the community, University President Drew G. Faust absolved the student of any personal accountability for his own actions and framed the situation to automatically paint the police as the offenders—using words such as “a student in obvious distress” and “forcible arrest.” In using this language, the administration portrays the student as the victim and implies that, regardless of circumstance, the police were in the wrong.
In the email, Faust stated, “We do not yet know all the facts, and it will take time before the necessary reviews have been completed and we have a fuller understanding of events leading up to the incident and the incident itself.” However, what is obvious is that this student made a series of personal choices—choices including the alleged use of narcotics, removal of clothing in public, and actions that prompted bystanders to call the police. The message the President’s office failed to convey is whether the student’s choices would also be reviewed or scrutinized, and whether disciplinary action will be taken if merited. Instead, her email reinforced the notion that the student was a blameless victim, even going as far as blaming the University for failing in its responsibility to “establish the conditions of trust necessary for effective campus policing.” Community members quickly passed judgment against the police and called for support of the student victim.
Faust missed an opportunity to help break the cycle of perpetually displaced blame and zero personal accountability that seems to permeate society. If we fail a test, the professor must be bad; if we don’t get the promotion, it’s because they don’t like us; if we fail to achieve success, it’s because the system was stacked against us. Students at Harvard understand that there are complex challenges dealing with race, gender, orientation, and the like in our community, but these challenges are often framed as resulting from the actions of others and do not address our own roles and responsibilities. This was not an incident of someone standing casually outside of a convenience store being assaulted by police. This was an incident where an adult made choices—choices that led directly to an interaction with law enforcement—and these choices have consequences. The Cambridge Police Department will review their own procedures and should hold people accountable if necessary, but they are just as much a part of this community and deserve the support of Harvard affiliates.
Will we review our own actions and hold ourselves accountable? How does one protect and serve a community when the police’s actions to subdue a noncompliant aggressor are automatically labeled as incorrect by those standing on the sidelines? This student could have proceeded to harass other community members, or worse, been struck by a passing motor vehicle. Has any of the outrage of the community focused on anything other than the moment of the incident—an incident that may have been avoided had different decisions been made?
The coverage of the student town hall addressing the incident made no mention of the student’s personal choices but was quick to place blame on everything from the University’s health system to implying that, regardless of the adult student’s state of mind, it was the University’s responsibility to keep him safe. The University president’s email stands to galvanize the already polarized attitude towards law enforcement, causing students to first question the actions of those in authority instead of their own choices.
Faust, deans, faculty, and students need to reevaluate the gap between the personal ideals that we say we value as a community and what our actions show. The administration should be taking a stance on this issue that is congruent with the Harvard Code of Conduct. This code outlines that the “expectation for mature and responsible conduct also encompasses accountability for one’s own well-being, including responsible decision-making regarding physical and mental health."
"The College takes all these diverse principles very seriously," the code adds. "Together they create a foundation for the responsible, respectful society that Harvard seeks to foster among its students, faculty, and staff.” Before offering an “out” to the community that this was another case of police using excessive force, the University president should have first taken the opportunity to emphasize and reinforce that we have a large part to play in the creation of a “responsible, respectful society.”
It’s time to break the cycle, take accountability for our own actions, and challenge those around us to take accountability for theirs. We must resist the urge to immediately pick a side and participate in “social justice” that does little to address the root causes of challenges we all came to this institution to help solve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tables in House dining halls have recently sprouted some interesting publications. One of the pop-up flyers promoting Harvard’s latest “inclusion” report reads, “With extraordinary education comes great responsibility.” The cheesy, quasi-Spider-Man cliché aside, I find this statement reflective of a very interesting and very concerning trend at the College.
I absolutely believe that Harvard offers something of an extraordinary education, but I am not convinced that all is as well as it seems in our classroom education. I firmly believe education is far more holistic than classroom and book knowledge, and that our educational experience is influenced by far more than studying. Yet I cannot help but wonder if we have become so enamored with “experiences” outside the classroom that we have neglected the very foundations of the liberal arts education for which we supposedly came to Harvard.
I see and hear many passionate voices clamoring for spaces of “belonging” and inclusion, read rigorous (though often nonsensical) debate over how we ought to manage extracurricular groups, and encounter vocal activism for every cause under the sun. Harvard students care deeply about a broad variety of issues with various levels of salience and relevance, but on perhaps the single issue that every undergraduate experiences with great consequence for our education, we are hauntingly silent.
This issue is the General Education system. Why we are not so invigorated to hold Harvard accountable for its failure to build a functional General Education system and support the liberal arts education on which it stakes its undergraduate reputation? Let me be clear: I do not believe those other activist endeavors I mentioned above are intrinsically bad, but I believe the assumption underpinning the pursuit of other agendas, that our education is simply extraordinary in its current state, is not always a given.
Other students have written incredibly compelling pieces about the shortcomings and flaws of the General Education system.  One observation in particular—that the Gen Ed system simply does not seem to be a priority for the administration—should be very troubling to the undergraduate community.
But while Harvard itself has admitted that one iteration of its General Education curriculum was “failing on a variety of fronts” and has since seemed to struggle mightily to replace it, I believe there is someone else who is to blame for this educational equivocation: us.
We also must hold ourselves accountable for our own education. As one of the authors of the General Education pieces once remarked to me over a meal, “The keys to a liberal arts education exist at Harvard. They’re just very hard to find.” Far too often, my peers and I find ourselves pouring through my.harvard to find those “gem” Gen Eds that entail the fewest deliverables and fewest class hours, with no regard for what we may or may not learn. I watch my peers more or less brag about how much class they’ve missed and how many lecture videos they’re behind in and how many pages they wrote in so few hours.
What we show up to reflects what’s important to us, and I’m deeply concerned that our Harvard education is not always as important to us as we like to claim. Do we want an education, or do we want a degree? Do we want to be transformed by the renewing of our minds or do we just want to pass? Don’t get me wrong, I know that committing 100 percent to each class every semester is next to impossible.
But we are cheating ourselves out of the richness of what Harvard can and does offer if we are only concerned with fulfilling requirements. Harvard could maybe make this easier by dedicating the massive task force resources it spent on changing a single “non-inclusive” song lyric to making its General Education system robust and worthwhile. We have to meet Harvard halfway for that to work.
I readily admit that there are big questions at stake for the future of the liberal arts in universities all over the world. It isn’t an unfounded claim that the traditional liberal arts education might not be adequately preparing college students for the demands of a 21st century digital labor force, or that scarce dollars might be better spent acquiring technical skills in a vocational or trade school.
I think those claims often miss the point of a liberal arts education, but that might be a column for another week. Most importantly, Harvard must not only meaningfully ask and engage those questions, but we also must ask ourselves why we wanted this kind of education in the first place and whether or not we actually want to pursue it with any dedication or rigor.

From man’s first encounter with fire to increases in global temperature, heat has played a sizeable role in human development. FM sat down with Richard W. Wrangham and Daniel E. Lieberman ’86—Professors of Biological Anthropology and Human Evolutionary Biology, respectively—to get an evolutionary perspective on everything from cooking to metabolism to physical activity to the fate of the human species.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
FM: How has the human ability to respond to, and utilize heat, provided us with an evolutionary advantage?
Richard W. Wrangham: Cooking is a human universal. It now appears clear that humans are biologically adapted to eating their food cooked, not only in the sense that they are easily able to take advantage of cooked food, but that they require cooked food on a regular basis. My evaluation of the evidence about the ways our bodies have changed is that it’s been true for almost two million years. What this means is, humanity, in the sense of the genus Homo, began when an ape learned to cook.
Daniel E. Lieberman ’86: While I don’t disagree with Richard that cooking was profound, fundamental, and important in human evolution, I believe that there was probably a two-stage process. First, the mechanical processing of food required less muscle force, fewer chews, and the particle size of the food was vastly reduced. When you digest food, it’s the surface area to volume ratio of the particles that determine the efficiency of digestion.
The other aspect of heat is not just the exogenous heat we create when we cook, but the heat we generate with our metabolism. The fire within us is very important. One of the topics I’m very interested in is to what extent human metabolism has changed over the last few million years and how much has physical activity played in those shifts to our metabolism. We have become a species that’s very energetically intensive—we use a lot of energy but we also get a lot of energy from our food.
FM: Based on the evolution of our metabolism, what might be one of the most widely held misconceptions about human nutrition?
DEL: One of the misconceptions and debates I’m very interested in is to what extent physical activity is important in losing weight. You can pick up a lot of popular articles and blogs in which people claim that physical activity is ineffective for losing weight. I think that’s a problematic argument for several reasons. Study after study has shown that physical activity, even after returning to a normal diet, prevents weight regain and that is because of its effects on our metabolism.
RWW: People think that by conducting the standard kind of test of how much heat is contained in a given food item that they can work out how many calories they will gain. In practice, the way that the body is designed to digest food means that the number of calories that we get is dependent on the physical state of the food—particularly whether or not it has been cooked.
The reason for this is that if the food has been cooked, the molecules are easier to digest; if they are easier to digest, the body spends less energy on digesting the food. This might explain partly why it is that the obesity crisis has come to us—it’s because we are eating food that has been more and more highly processed.
FM: Has your study of evolutionary biology made you more or less hopeful for humans’ current condition and future?
DEL: The world continues to go through a post-industrialization transition in which more and more of us are eating processed food and doing less physical activity. You could say, on one hand, that we are headed towards higher rates of heart disease and higher rates of diseases such as diabetes. On the other hand, these are changes brought by culture; cultural evolution is driving many of these shifts. The beauty of cultural evolution is that we can change it in the other direction. The solution will not just be treating these diseases as they arise but preventing them. We need to recognize this is an issue at Harvard, not just in terms of our community’s long term health but even our short term health. I’d love to see a dialogue at Harvard about reintroducing a physical activity requirement—not only for undergraduates but for the faculty as well.
RWW: One has to take an evolutionary perspective on pessimism and optimism on what the future of the world is in terms of other species occupying it. What we are doing at the moment is a fairly continuous approach towards treating the whole of the planet earth as a giant human feedlot. From the point of wildlife conservationists, this is a tragedy.
We are already in one of the great episodes of extinction of all time. From an evolutionary perspective, it is alarming that with whatever is going on in terms of quality of human life we are running the risk of becoming so dominant on the world that it actually undermines our own future.
DEL: This is where an evolutionary perspective is vital, when we think about how we are going to solve all of these challenges—overpopulation, increasing disparities between rich and poor, higher levels of obesity—we have a tendency to think of these problems in terms of the here and now. As we tackle these serious challenges, we cannot leave evolution out of the equation. We can’t live without it.

UPDATED: May 3, 2018 at 2:36 p.m.
The 115th Congress boasts more than 40 Harvard graduates split between the House and Senate. But, at Harvard, no connection reaches as high as Senator Charles E. “Chuck” Schumer ’71 of New York, the Democratic Leader.
The former Adams House resident became the Senate’s top-ranking Democrat in 2017—coming into the role on the heels of President Donald Trump’s victory and during a period of historic political polarization.
As a top congressional leader, Schumer has met with University President Drew G. Faust multiple times during her lobbying trips to Washington, D.C., where she's argued for protections for immigrants and research funding, and against a recently passed tax on some University endowments.
But before he hobnobbed with the University's president, Schumer was just another undergraduate at the College.
Like many of his classmates, much of Schumer’s political ideology was molded and shaped while in college. The senator received his bachelor’s degree from the College and a J.D. from the Law School before formally launching his political career.  Long before he ran for office, he was a Social Studies concentrator and a Harvard Democrat.
“People often ask me what Chuck was like in college and my answer is—and I really think it’s true—basically the same as he is today,” David A. Barrett ’71 said about his old college roommate.
When Schumer first moved into Matthews Hall in fall 1967 after attending a working class high school in Brooklyn, he planned to pursue a science-heavy education. Schumer filled his schedule with advanced life science courses, before discovering his true passion: politics.
In the spring of 1968, Schumer tested the political waters by volunteering on the presidential campaign for Democratic senator Eugene J. McCarthy. McCarthy was narrowly defeated by the incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson in the New Hampshire primary.
Schumer wrote in an email that he credits McCarthy’s campaign with Johnson’s ultimate decision not to seek re-election—and to the development of his own interest in politics.
“I said to myself, ‘Wow. A ragtag group of students and other assorted nobodies toppled the most powerful man in the world. This is what I want to dedicate my life to,’” Schumer wrote.
Returning to campus in the fall, the future senator changed his concentration from Chemistry to Social Studies and quickly became an influential voice on Harvard’s highly politicized campus of the late 1960's. Among other roles, he served as president of the Young Democrats Organization.
Schumer’s political involvement was not limited to extracurriculars, but also seeped into his academic interests, which eventually culminated in a thesis on congressional politics entitled, “216 Congressmen; a study of Congressional activity and time allocations.”
While the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies has evolved since Schumer’s time at the College, Anya B. Bassett, the Social Studies director of studies, stressed the importance of the curriculum to gaining an interdisciplinary understanding of complex social issues.
“Many [Social Studies students] leave Social Studies and go on to lives of service in law, medicine, non-profit work, activism, teaching, and politics” Bassett said.
Bassett said Social Studies has a long history of producing politicians from the national level to the local level.
“Schumer’s newest political heirs in Social Studies are David LeBoeuf ’13, who is running for State Representative in Massachusetts this year, and Chloe Maxmin ’15, who is running for State Representative in Maine,” Bassett added.
Schumer looks back fondly on his time at the College, where he at one point took the equivalent of Economics 10: “Principles of Economics.”
He described it as “one of the most important classes I ever took,” along with writing his senior thesis on the nuances of congressional time allocation. He maintains, however, that his most enlightening time at Harvard was spent amongst peers.
“The best education I got was at the Adams House Dining Room where we’d sit for hours and hours and talk about the great problems, great challenges and great opportunities in life,” Schumer wrote. “I learned so much there, the Harvard student body was frankly the best teachers that I had.”
Schumer carried this affinity for a dining hall education into his political career, according to Barrett.
“That genuine interest in people and ability to remember people without index cards is something that you actually see today,” Barrett said. “He really cares about interacting with people and what makes them tick, what are their problems and that’s very genuine and I think it existed at that time.”
Schumer wrote the Harvard he entered as a freshman "changed dramatically" over his four years at the College.
“When I was a freshman you had to wear a jacket and tie to breakfast lunch and dinner," he wrote. "Women were allowed in the rooms from two to five on Sundays and you’d get suspended or even booted from Harvard if you violated those rules.”
The period was also a tumultuous time for Harvard, with frequent student protests in and around the Yard. Campus politics were mired in national issues, like the tension over the Vietnam War and the military draft. According to Barrett, Schumer sometimes utilized his position in the Young Democrats Organization to calm the waters.
“Chuck was always very much a moderate. Understanding I think the way that both sides felt but trying to sort of steer a middle course in a constructive way which is what I think he still tries to do politically,” Barrett added.
Schumer attributes the political environment on Harvard’s campus during this time to the formation of his own ideology.
“I was president of the Harvard Young Democrats and we were mainly involved in the anti-war movement; planning rallies, writing letters and making phone calls and doing all of that. And so it had a major, major effect on me,” Schumer wrote.
Campus tensions boiled over in an incident in spring 1969 when student protesters took over University Hall and were violently "busted" by state and local police. The event, dubbed by students at the time as “The Bust,” left a lasting mark on Harvard students, including Schumer.
Barrett recalled one of most exciting moments of the strike and resulting bust. It was 6 a.m. when the local and state police confronted the protesting students.
“I remember all four of us were running over from Adams House to the Yard to see what was going on and it, you know, was a very very fraught thing,” Barrett said.
Schumer wrote that, not only did the College change during his undergraduate years, but the world around it changed too.
“The world dramatically changed, within a few years there was co-ed education, women and men living in the houses together and many other changes that I’m sure people are familiar with,” Schumer wrote.
“While it has changed dramatically, learning from your fellow students and making lifelong friends at Harvard has remained the same and it’s one of the best aspects of the Harvard education,” he added.
Now, more than four decades after his graduation, Harvard has returned to Schumer. In a period of tension between elite universities and the federal government that has escalated in recent years, Faust has stepped up her advocacy in Washington. In February 2017, Faust met with Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, to discuss research funding and immigration policy in the wake of Trump’s inauguration.
As Harvard’s President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow takes the University’s helm this summer, he will likely continue Faust's struggle to make the case for Harvard before a Congress and presidential administration often at odds with the University’s goals. Bacow has already indicated his intent to lobby on Harvard’s behalf—a task that will likely involve help from a Harvard graduate, the Senate’s top Democrat.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 3, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated David A. Barrett ’71 called Charles E. “Chuck” Schumer ’71 a "nodder." In fact, Barrett called Schumer a "moderate."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School is in final negotiations to sell part of its property at 4 Blackfan Circle, and it will likely close the sale in May or June, Medical School Dean George Q. Daley said in an interview Tuesday.
The building, located between Vanderbilt Hall and the New Research Building on the school’s Longwood campus, has been on the market for at least five months.
In order to access pricing information and negotiate, potential buyers were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Daley said more than 90 firms requested information in this manner, about 40 of which sent representatives to the building to tour it.
At least 12 firms made bids on the building, according to Daley. At this point in the sale process, experts say sellers usually examine bids to determine whether they are viable and aligned with institutional priorities.
“Those types of criteria might be vetted,” said Aaron Jodka, research director at Colliers International, a real estate firm.
“We selected what we thought would be the best partners because these are folks that we're going to be working with in our community,” Daley said of the vetting process for bids on the property.
Daley said that, after reviewing second-round bids, the school began negotiations with potential buyers. Harvard plans to close the sale in “mid-to-late May or early June,” he added.
Pricing information is protected by the confidentiality agreement, and Jodka said few properties are put on the market in Longwood, making it difficult to find reference prices.
“The challenge with the Longwood Medical Area is that most of those properties are owned by institutions,” he said. “So you don’t actually see a lot of trading activity there.”
Still, he emphasized that the limited stock of property in Boston and Cambridge makes properties desirable.
“Boston is a highly targeted market by institutional investors,” he said. “When good-quality assets come to market, they are hotly contested.”
Daley agreed that the surrounding area made the sale attractive to buyers.
“It's extraordinary. It's evidence of the incredible value of being in this community. We're an incredibly dense community of scientific innovation and clinical care,” he said.
The entire property is not for sale — just eight of the building’s 11 floors. The deal will be organized as a 99-year unsubordinated leasehold interest, which means that Harvard will still own the building in name, but will give up all other rights to the purchaser.
Harvard Medical School brought in commercial real estate firm HFF and consulting firm Transwestern to manage the marketing and sale of 4 Blackfan Circle, according to listing documents. The school and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute currently use the laboratory spaces that will be sold.
Daley said in December he hopes the sale will help the school pay off some of its debt in order to reduce the school’s interest payments. Last fiscal year, the Medical School ran a $44 million deficit, marking the ninth time in the last 10 years that the school closed in the red.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some students planning to take advantage of the College’s new “Education Studies” secondary said they are looking forward to the potential for increased structure to their education coursework and new connections between undergraduates interested in education.
The new secondary—announced earlier this month— is designed as an interdisciplinary approach to education, with classes focusing on education policy, the sociological and economic impacts of education, as well as pedagogy, the academic method and practice of teaching.
“Before now, the College’s system did not allow students to have formal advising, mentorship, or, really, guidance on what education looks like,” UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19  said. “The education secondary fills in this gap for students to study what education means in a very theoretical, more interdisciplinary lens.”
Winthrop House Representative Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who chaired the Undergraduate Council Education Committee, said that the secondary is important both in the context of the university’s offerings, and for its legitimizing effect on education as a field.
“Having Harvard approve the secondary does affirm their commitment to supporting education. This institutional background is going to be really important in terms of perceptions and also its effects on campus,” Palaniappan, who plans to declare the secondary, said.
Leverett House Representative  Ben I. Sorkin ’20, who was vice chair of the UC’s Education Committee, said the secondary  is “super important” because it will provide a “unified” advising structure. Sorkin said while Harvard already has a few courses in education, those classes are unevenly spread out across the university.
Sorkin said once he declares the secondary, he can “connect with people [he’s] seen repeatedly in classes” on education.
Until now, Sorkin said, the only advising available for College students interested in education coursework was through office hours hosted once a semester by Katherine K. Merseth, a senior lecturer in education. With the new secondary, professors across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Education will be on hand to advise students both on coursework and on their senior theses.
Tatiana Patino ’20, who said she has always known she wants to be a high school teacher, said the secondary will make it easier to teach while still in college, and have a more “tangible impact” when doing so.
“I work for an after-school program, and I think a lot about how education impacts my children,” Patino said. “I’ve been having those conversations either unguided or with guidance through PBHA, which is amazing. But I think it’ll be really cool to have those conversations with more academic backing through the college.”
Palaniappan said that multiple alumni of the College contacted her after the secondary was announced.
“Some of them have already reached out and said, ‘I wish this structure was there when I was in college,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A group of seven Harvard Law School alumni wrote an open letter Monday asking Law School Dean John F. Manning ‘82 if he intends to publicly respond to a report published last fall that criticizes the school’s commitment to public interest.
The report, titled “Our Bicentennial Crisis: A Call to Action for Harvard Law School’s Public Interest Mission,” argues that the Law School is primarily geared towards corporate law and needs to shift its focus to public interest careers.
The report, primarily authored by third-year Law student Pete D. Davis ’12, is divided into four parts. It argues that the average American is largely excluded from legal power, and charges that the Law School has failed to address this problem. Davis also published the report in book form.
Monday’s open letter criticized Manning’s silence on the report. Alumni wrote that six months after the report’s release, Manning has still failed to deliver “a considered written response to its cogent points” or have “a general meeting with the students for a public discussion.”
Law school spokesperson Michelle Deakin declined to comment on behalf of Manning.
“The dean generally does not comment on correspondence with alumni,” Deakin wrote in an email.
Ralph Nader, a Law School graduate and five-time presidential candidate, signed the letter along with six other alumni. In an interview Tuesday, Nader praised Davis’s report and said he signed the letter because he believes administrators should take the report seriously.
“It’s one of the few, rare critical reports of Harvard Law School—there have been about three in the past thirty, thirty-five years—and it has well-documented criticisms, principally that Harvard Law School is an incubator for lawyers to go to work for corporate power, either directly or through corporate law firms,” Nader said.
He also added that the Law School has failed to uphold its mission statement, which says the school prepares leaders who will contribute to improving society and furthering justice.
“To put it simply, the mission statement of Harvard Law School is in the preface to [Davis's] book and it's ‘to educate leaders who contribute to the advancement of justice and the well-being of society,'’” Nader said. “And with a few luminous exceptions… they’re really educating leaders who contribute to the advancement of corporate power, its concentration, and its obstruction of justice against the American people and it’s not contributing leaders to the advancement of justice and well-being of society.”
The open letter is the latest development in an ongoing movement calling on the school to better incentivize students to pursue careers in public service. Davis hosted an event with faculty and students in February to discuss public interest at the Law School, and Nader urged students at an event in November to protest what he called the school’s “corporate” focus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School announced a new fellowship program for Palestinian students Tuesday.
The Rawabi Fellowship for Leaders from Palestine is a “merit-based, competitive” program for Kennedy School students who identify as Palestinian, targeted specifically at those with financial need, according to a Tuesday press release.
The fellowship covers students’ costs of tuition and health insurance as well as providing stipends to students in the school’s degree programs. The fellowship will also provide financial support for Palestinian participants in the school’s educational seminars and other programs.
Palestinian businessman and entrepreneur Bashar Masri will fund the fellowship. Masri is currently a member of the Kennedy School’s Dean’s Council and a member of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources, a group of the University’s biggest donors. He is also the founder of Rawabi City, the first planned city for Palestinians built by Palestinians on the politically tumultuous West Bank.
Masri is also the founder and manager of Palestine’s first private equity fund and the creator of Al-Ayyam, the second-largest daily newspaper in Palestine.
In the press release, Masri lauded the Kennedy School’s faculty and students and said the school was “uniquely qualified” to educate future Palestinian leaders.
“It is critical that we support those who are, or will become, catalysts for positive change in Palestine, with the goal of moving toward a prosperous and peaceful future,” Masri said.
The Rawabi Fellows will also have access to events put on by the Middle East Initiative, a program researching Middle Eastern public policy out of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Relations. MEI will also provide travel and internship support for the fellows.
Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf said Masri’s gift will help inspire future generations of Palestinian leaders.
“Principled and effective public leadership is needed to tackle the range of challenges that the people in the region are facing,” Elmendorf said. “This generous gift will empower future generations of leaders to strengthen the region’s political, social, and economic development.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 is serving as the lead trial lawyer for an affirmative action lawsuit against the University and has recused himself from the Corporation's discussions regarding the suit since he took on this role, Lee said in an interview Monday.
“About a year ago, I actually recused myself from any Corporation discussion of the case so that I can act as a lawyer for Harvard in the case,” Lee said.
“I literally step out of the room,” he added.
Lee has been a member of the 13-person Harvard Corporation since 2010. He is also a partner at WilmerHale, the law firm representing the University in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit in question was filed against the University in 2014 by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. It alleges the College illegally discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. The College has consistently denied the allegations, arguing it “does not discriminate against applicants from any group in its admissions processes.”
Acting in his capacity as the University’s lawyer, Lee penned an April 9 letter calling the Justice Department’s intervention in the lawsuit “perplexing” and “entirely unnecessary.” The Justice Department filed a briefing April 6 asking the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts to unseal previously confidential admissions documents and information.
In a statement provided by University spokesperson Paul Andrew, Lee confirmed that “he was acting as part of the WilmerHale team and that the firm does not charge Harvard for his time, nor does he receive any payment for revenue based on the firm’s billing to Harvard as part of the case.”
Attorneys for Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions met on April 10 to discuss disagreements about the handling of confidential materials in the case, with Judge Allison D. Burroughs determining that a small, redacted portion of more than 90,000 admissions documents will  become public in the coming months.
Burroughs also set a June 15 deadline for the parties to file motions on whether the lawsuit can be resolved without a trial, currently tentatively scheduled for October.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 29, 2018 at 6:30 a.m.
Harvard affiliates gathered Tuesday to celebrate the winners of The Transcript Project and to share their own stories about their academic experiences.
To participate in the inaugural Transcript Project, a contest for undergraduates, students submitted a piece of work that reflected on their academic experiences at Harvard not captured by their grades. The six winners of the competition, who were recognized at the Transcript Project Salon Tuesday, are Alana Davitt ’19, Amanda Flores ’18, Michelle Ko ’19, Paul Lewis ’18, Sarah Perlmutter ’19, and Audrey Pettner ’21.
Five jury members—History of Art and Architecture and African and African American Studies Professor Sarah Lewis, English Professor Elaine Scarry, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton, Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey, and Visual and Environmental Studies Professor Karthik Pandian—selected the winners.
Kelsey, the founder of the project, began the event by reiterating its purpose.
“I wanted to reinforce the notion of the transcript as an untold story, an array of marks awaiting a heartfelt narrative, begging to be brought to life by the person whose long nights, difficult decisions, and moments of inspiration lay silent in the gray lines provided by the registrar,” Kelsey said. “We decided to make it a contest, but with an emphasis on creativity and participation.”
During the first half of the salon, members of the selection jury introduced the winners and spoke about their accomplishments. Kelsey said in an interview that he was happy with the projects that students submitted.
“I was thrilled with the submissions,” Kelsey said. “[The students] caught onto the spirit of the project and understood that what we were looking for was an account of how passion both goes into and comes out of curricular experience, in some ways that are predictable and in some ways that are not.”
While not sure of the exact number, Kelsey said “over 20” students participated in the project. Of those, six were declared winners, and they will each receive a Coop gift card as a prize.
Five of the six winners submitted written works to the project. Pettner, for instance, wrote about her experience in a freshman seminar that studied coin collections at the Harvard Art Museum. Scarry recognized Pettner’s submission at the salon.
“Audrey has three metaphors going [in her essay] and does it with breathtaking elegance,” Scarry said. “And she uses the three of them in order to show that her passion for rigor and meticulous organization can be braided with her passion for wild creativity.”
Flores, an anthropology concentrator, wrote a poem about her academic experiences in six different languages to which she has been exposed at Harvard and in her studies abroad.
“It’s wonderful enough to write a poem in fourteen quatrains about your undergraduate studies, but what made this particularly remarkable was that stanza six was in French, stanza seven was in Spanish, stanza eight was in Polish, stanza nine was in German, and stanza eleven was in Kinyarwanda,” Scarry said.
Davitt, a mechanical engineering concentrator, wrote her own song and performed it at the event.
“It was such an affecting and sensitive song about the unexpected unfolding of self in the course of college studies, a song so exquisitely sung that it was clearly a winner,” Kelsey said.
During the second half of the salon, an open-mic portion, any students attending the event could speak about their academic experiences. One student spoke about dealing with depression in the midst of a busy academic life. Another explained how taking “The Classic Phase of the Novel”, an English class, persuaded him to become an English concentrator even though he had already declared Government.
“I’ve never been to anything like this,” Pettner said of the salon in an interview. “It was a nice reminder that there are a lot of people exploring and that that’s actually okay and welcome.”

This is part three of The Crimson’s five-part series analyzing exit polling data collected during Harvard’s 2018 unionization election. Read part one here, part two here, and part four here.
Students who voted in favor of unionization last week were more likely to report feeling dissatisfied with Harvard’s advising and financial support systems, according to exit polling data collected by The Crimson.
Of respondents to The Crimson’s exit poll, students who voted “Yes” were twice as likely as those who voted “No” to rate their relationship with their primary Harvard academic advisor poorly. Pro-union voters were also nine times more likely than anti-union voters to give the University’s financial support the lowest possible score on a scale of 1 to 5.
Survey respondents who voted to unionize on average reported a lower opinion of the effectiveness of existing graduate student government bodies. In general, respondents mostly reported holding liberal political views; voters against unionization were most likely to identify themselves as “Liberal” while pro-union voters were most likely to identify themselves as “Very Liberal.”
Harvard’s second unionization election took place on April 18 and 19. The final tally fell in favor of the union—56 percent of students who cast ballots voted to authorize Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers to begin collectively bargaining with Harvard on behalf of eligible teaching and research assistants. Over 5,000 students are included in the new bargaining unit, though it is not yet clear if Harvard will negotiate with HGSU-UAW.
The Crimson conducted its exit poll on both days of the election, stationing reporters at the three voting locations in Cambridge, Longwood, and Allston for 78 percent of all hours the sites remained open. Reporters collected exit surveys from 1,295 voters, representing over a third of the voting population.
The 23-question survey asked respondents for their opinions on collective bargaining, politics, and salient campus issues. The data presented in this story has not been corrected for any possible response bias (see methodology below).
In particular, The Crimson’s exit poll asked respondents to rate the quality of their relationship with their primary academic advisor on a scale of 1—“Poor”— to 5, or “Excellent.” Most graduate students work with an academic advisor provided by Harvard throughout their time at the University, often utilizing the advisor as a research mentor.
Students who voted “Yes” reported on average that they feel less satisfied with their advisors—27 percent of “Yes” voters surveyed rated their satisfaction with their advising relationship a 3 or below. Just 13 percent of “No” voters indicated the same score.
Overall, 11.5 percent of total survey respondents rated the quality of their relationship with their primary advisor below a 3.
In a recent Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student life survey, less than 10 percent of respondents expressed concerns about their relationship with their primary advisor.
Of respondents to The Crimson's survey, 61 percent of “No” voters rated their advising relationship the highest score of 5; 46 percent of “Yes” voters did the same.
Asked to report their level of satisfaction with the University’s financial support on a scale from 1 (“Poor”) to 5 (“Excellent”), “Yes” voters reported they feel, on average, less satisfied with the program than their anti-union counterparts. Voters who supported unionization gave the program an average score of 3.2 while voters who opposed unionization gave an average score of 4.3.
For eight of the past nine years, GSAS students received a 3 percent annual increase in their stipends, which Harvard provides to all Ph.D. students. But last year—citing Harvard’s poor endowment returns—administrators announced a 1.5 percent increase. The unusually low stipend increase drew the ire of union organizers, who later argued a union would ensure wage security.
The Crimson’s survey also asked voters for their opinions on the effectiveness of student councils and forums—again utilizing the scale of 1 (“Poor”) to 5 (“Excellent”). Pro-union voters were more likely to report they feel student government is ineffective.
On average, those who voted “Yes” assigned student forums and councils a rating of 2.8 out of 5. Anti-union voters, however, gave student government an average ranking of 3.2. Fifteen percent of “Yes” voters assigned student forums and councils the lowest score of 1. Only 8 percent of “No” voters expressed the same level of dissatisfaction.
In the run-up to the election, pro- and anti-union groups on campus repeatedly debated how a union would redefine the role of student government on campus.
If Harvard chooses to recognize the union, student stipends and benefits—traditionally the province of student forums like the Graduate Student Council—are expected to instead be negotiated via collective bargaining. In an interview prior to the vote, Summer A. Shafer, an ex-GSC president and former union organizer, said she thinks this setup would benefit students.
“The GSC has been—throughout my time participating—very good at awarding money for conferences and for summer research, for recognizing superb mentors,” Shafer said. “[The union] might actually even make the GSC better, because it’ll force a redefinition of goals and priorities.”
The Crimson’s exit poll also asked respondents to describe their political views by choosing between six options: “Very Conservative,” “Conservative,” “Moderate,” “Liberal,” “Very Liberal,” or “Apolitical.”
The vast majority of the voting population reported left-leaning politics. Of respondents, 84.2 percent selected either “Liberal” or “Very Liberal.”
Similar numbers of union supporters and opponents identified themselves as “Liberal”: 39 percent of “Yes” voters and 41.2 percent of “No” voters did so.
But pro-union respondents were far more likely than anti-union respondents to identify themselves as “Very Liberal.” Approximately 52.4 percent of respondents who voted “Yes”—as opposed to the 25.3 percent who voted “No”—checked off that identification.
Of respondents, 20.5 percent of “No” voters identified themselves as “moderate” while just 5.6 percent of “Yes” voters selected the same. Only 1.9 percent of respondents overall reported identifying as “Apolitical.”
The data presented in this story is entirely sourced from the exit poll of eligible voters The Crimson conducted during the two days of the April 2018 unionization election.
Crimson analysis of the raw exit poll data indicated voters in favor of unionization were more likely to fill out the survey than were voters who voted against unionization. Specifically, The Crimson calculated an oversampling factor of 1.32 for respondents who reported voting “yes.” The Crimson’s survey specifically asked students whether they voted in the Nov. 2016 election and, if so, whether they had changed their mind on unionization since the first vote.
Using the responses to these questions, The Crimson calculated the 32 percent oversampling by taking the percentage of respondents who reported they voted yes in both the April 2018 and Nov. 2016 elections (out of all respondents who voted in the Nov. 2016 election and indicated they did not change their minds in the interim), then dividing it by the actual percentage of voters who voted in favor of unionization in Nov. 2016. The Crimson utilized this response bias factor, in addition to a geographic correction that reweighted the data by polling site, to infer that approximately 50.6 percent of eligible voters who cast ballots April 18 and 19 voted in favor of unionization.
The official vote count Friday revealed that roughly 56 percent of those who cast ballots voted in favor in unionization, leading to an overall oversampling factor of 1.23. Unless otherwise indicated, the data reported in this story is the raw data from the survey and has not been corrected for this apparent response bias.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 25, 2018 at 3:11 p.m.
Ten College students have travelled to the nation’s capital and will lobby members of Congress Wednesday in an effort to imperil Harvard’s ability to enforce its social group penalties, Graduate President of the Fly Club Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 said in an interview Tuesday.
These students are members of final clubs and Greek organizations on campus, Porteus told The Crimson. In the interview—which also included Dani Weatherford, executive director of the National Panhellenic Conference and Judson Horras, president and CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference—Porteus declined to identify the students and the specific social groups they represent.
He said the students requested anonymity out of fear of possible repercussions from the College.
The students are particularly lobbying around the PROSPER Act, a proposed update to the Higher Education Act that—if passed—could force Harvard to choose between millions of dollars in federal research funding and its social group penalties.
The College’s social group policy—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bars all members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
The PROSPER Act in its current form likely does not affect Harvard; over the past few months, some campus social groups have begun lobbying Congress to change the wording of an amendment in the act to render the legislation applicable to Harvard.
“We are continuing to work on that language with members of Congress,” Weatherford said in the interview. “There are still opportunities to amend that language as it makes it to the House floor.”
“There are also those opportunities on the Senate side, as they are still drafting that bill,” she added.
The Harvard undergraduates’ visit to the capital forms part of a larger push by national fraternities and sororities to lobby Congress to enact protections for Greek life more broadly. The ten College students will be joined by more than 200 undergraduates representing Greek chapters at other campuses across the country, according to Weatherford.
The students’ involvement also comes as campus social groups are stepping up efforts to oppose the sanctions on Capitol Hill. Some social organizations have banded together to form the Cambridge Coalition, a group that has retained tony D.C. firm Arnold & Porter to oversee its lobbying efforts. A member of the Porcellian Club also recently joined the board of directors for the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee, the premier political arm for Greek organizations in the United States.
The group of undergraduates will split into small teams and will attend a combined roughly 450 meetings on the Hill with members of Congress and other staffers Wednesday, Horras said.
Students will reference Harvard’s social group policy at each meeting, according to Porteus.
“Harvard was consistently emphasized in the sense that it galvanized everyone’s attention,” Porteus said. “Harvard will be cited frequently as an example of the direction things could change if not questioned and held in check.”
The students will meet with members of Congress “who have the ability to influence the Higher Education Act reauthorization,” Weatherford said. This includes members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, she added.
Weatherford also said the lobbying schedule will include meetings with Congresspeople representing members and alumni of Greek organizations and districts that contain colleges or universities with Greek groups.
“We also want to speak to those individuals who represent districts where our organizations either have headquarters or in districts where organizations have chapters,” she said. “So that’s just about every district in the country.”
The Harvard students will divide into three student lobbying teams, each of which is scheduled to hold around 15 meetings, Porteus said.
Porteus added the teams of Harvard students are “balanced” between male and female members.
Weatherford said this week’s efforts do not mark the first time single-gender organizations have lobbied around the Higher Education Act reauthorization. She added past efforts have been met with “very warm receptions.”
Weatherford said North Carolina Representative Virginia R. Foxx, a Republican who proposed the PROSPER Act, is a “great champion of this effort.” Another Republican, Tennessee Senator A. Lamar Alexander, has also been “very open” to having conversations with representatives from Greek organizations, Weatherford said.
Horras added Democratic Ohio Representative Marsha L. Fudge has also been receptive to the Greek organizations’ lobbying efforts.
Horras said during the interview that NIC representatives emailed Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana 18 months ago about working with the College on the social group policy, but never received a response.
Weatherford said national leaders of sororities previously met with Harvard administrators, including Khurana, to discuss the social group policy.
“As members of this community, we all have an opportunity to create a campus culture that is rooted in respect and inclusion,” Khurana wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday. “The College’s policy on USGSO’s is designed to help students build a community in which every student can thrive, and it does so on the foundation of a set of shared values including belonging, inclusion, and non-discrimination.”
Both Weatherford and Porteus said they are optimistic their lobbying efforts will have tangible effects. Porteus in part pointed to a 2018 public opinion survey that suggests American adults believe college students have the right to join single-gender social groups.
Arnold & Porter employed polling firm Morning Consult to conduct the survey in February, according to an email from Kevin O’Neill, a lobbyist for Arnold & Porter.
The final results indicated 77 percent of adults believe “students should have the right to gather in the student organizations of their choice, on campus or off campus” and 60 percent believe “Congress should pass legislation that allows students to join any campus organization at the time of their choosing, assuming they are academically eligible to do so,” according to O’Neill.
“We have great belief that this language will be included in the final version of the HEA reauthorization,” Weatherford said of the efforts to change the wording of the PROSPER Act.
“Earlier attempts at lobbying opened the door to serious discussion about this in Congress,” Porteus said. “Tomorrow’s event should really push the door wide open.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: April 25, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Judson Horras's affiliation; he represents the North-American Interfraternity Conference, not the National Interfraternity Conference.
CORRECTION: April 25, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Horras said National Panhellenic Conference representatives contacted Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana about the sanctions. In fact, he said North-American Interfraternity Conference representatives contacted Khurana.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A game in Worcester against Holy Cross on March 29—postponed due to weather and field conditions. An April 3 tilt across the river against Boston University—again canned due to poor playing conditions. And the same happened for mid-April games at Providence and at home against Bryant.
After a brutal New England spring produced four consecutive weeks of canceled midweek games, the Harvard softball team finally played its first non-conference contest since the end of tournament play. In its last game before heading to Brown to close out the regular season, the Crimson (20-14, 13-5 Ivy) lost, 3-1, against Boston College (26-18, 11-6 ACC) at the new Harrington Athletics Village in Brighton.
“That’s the type of team we will face if we make regionals, so I think it allowed us to see that we can compete with those teams and gave us even more motivation going into Brown this weekend,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said.
A 1-1 stalemate lasted from the end of the first through the top of the sixth, but the Eagles finally broke through in the bottom of the sixth. Designated player Allyson Moore drew a walk to lead off the inning. Consecutive sacrifice bunt attempts—along with an error on center fielder Lexi DiEmmanuele’s bunt—brought Moore all the way around to break the tie.
“I think this game’s errors, for both sides, helped the other team offensively,” Rich said. “But errors are part of the game and it’s about limiting them and pushing past them when they do occur.”
DiEmmanuele continued to push the envelope. With one out, she stole third to set up a sacrifice fly to right field by shortstop Chloe Sharabba. Boston College appeared poised to add even more runs to its newfound 3-1 lead, as left fielder Annie Murphy doubled and fellow corner outfielder CC Cook was hit by a pitch. However, Harvard left-hander Katie Duncan shut down the threat by getting catcher Emme Martinez to chase strike three.
Suddenly, the Crimson had to manufacture a comeback attempt in the top of the seventh. Harvard got off to a promising start, as two of the first three batters of the inning reached base. That was all Harvard would muster, though. Eagles pitcher Jessica Dreswick struck out Meagan Lantz and induced a flyout to right to close out the ballgame.
Dreswick was impressive for all seven innings. The senior right-hander allowed just one run, five hits, and two walks, and she struck out five Crimson.
“[Dreswick] was definitely a challenge because she throws harder than what we’re used to seeing and she hit her spots well,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said.
“[She] did a good job of keeping the ball off the plate,” junior catcher Elizabeth Shively added. “She attacked the corners and threw a screwball in to righties that was effective.”
Dreswick and BC’s defense effectively shut down Harvard after the first inning. The visitors kicked off the game by scoring a run in the first inning, but the Crimson recorded just two hits and two walks the rest of the way. Harvard did not advance a runner past second base in the final six frames.
In its first trip to the plate, the Crimson got things started with a Rhianna Rich infield single. Junior second baseman Meagan Lantz followed with Harvard’s only extra base hit of the game, doubling to center field. On a fielding error by DiEmmanuele, Rich scored and Lantz moved up to third. However, the Crimson was unable to add to its early lead as Lantz was cut down trying to score on a grounder to second base.
Of Harvard’s five hits, three came courtesy of Rich. The junior is now hitting .442/.496/.658 in 2018.
Sophomore Olivia Giaquinto got the start in the circle, and she gave up just one run in four innings. The right-hander worked out of tight spots in the first three frames before setting down the Eagles in order with three groundouts in the fourth.
“It wasn’t in our game plan to try and completely shut them down offensively,” Giaquinto said. “We knew they were going to put the ball in play and get on, so defensively we just focused on our process to get outs. My defense made plays behind me and we were able to shut them down that way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of the final round of the Ivy League Championships, Harvard women’s golf remained tied with Princeton for the top spot to decide the conference crown. In dramatic fashion, the Crimson came up just short in a playoff hole against the Tigers to decide the Ancient Eight title.
In addition to the climactic second-place finish for the Harvard team, Crimson junior Michelle Xie finished atop the individual golfer standings to become the Ivy League Individual Champion. Following a first day at five over par, Xie finished days two and three at one under and even par, respectively. Xie recorded no birdies in her first day, but she quickly reversed course to record six birdies in the next two days and finish on top.
Following a tournament-best score of 294 in the final round on Sunday, Harvard and Princeton continued to play onto hole 19 for the day. Ultimately, the Tigers would prevail for its second straight conference championship with a score of two under par between its four golfers on the hole, while the Crimson golfers combined for a score of four over par.
“Everyone definitely brought their best,” junior Anna Zhou said. “And there’s nothing more we can ask for.”
Harvard and Princeton were neck and neck throughout the entire tournament. The Crimson finished the first round one stroke ahead of the Tigers sitting in second place. Princeton regained the lead from Harvard by finishing one stroke ahead of its rival on day two, setting up a showdown on the final day between the reigning champion Tigers and the Crimson, the recently dethroned champions coming off of a broken-up five-peat.
“It was a very interesting week,” senior captain Lita Guo said. “The chances of having a playoff and ending with a tie are rare.”
Along with Xie, the team as a whole saw improvement as the weekend progressed as well, as Harvard improved from 313 strokes on the first day to 304 on Saturday and eventually 294 in the final round.
“Everyone played their best, we kept improving on our scores each day,” Zhou said. “The last day we made a really good run.”
The entire team stepped up to the occasion with the tournament on the line heading into the final day. Senior captain Lita Guo rebounded from her scores of 81 and 80 in the first two rounds and put together an impressive 74 in round three. Zhou mirrored Guo’s 74 following her own scores of 83 and 80 in the first two rounds.
Freshman Belinda Hu also improved with a quality final round to finish fifth overall in her first Ivy League Championships. Hu recorded scores of 76 on the first two days, and then shined with a 74 in the third round.
The overall environment of the Ivy League Tournament, a new experience to the Crimson freshmen golfers, added to the energetic dynamic of the weekend.
“I think Ivies is really special because I specifically felt the team spirit more than any other tournament,” freshman Jessica Luo said. “It was all of us working together towards one common goal, and it brought us closer together. The team spirit in Ivies is incredible.”
Although the season ended in a playoff hole defeat, Harvard netted positives in the tumultuous spring season.
“We definitely had a solid season,” Zhou said. “Everyone worked really hard given the situation with weather conditions and everything else.”
And despite the late winter and fierce Boston conditions, the Crimson put together a season that included a victory at its home Harvard Invitational played in Florida.
For Harvard’s lone senior, Guo, the tournament would be the last competition as a Crimson.
“It was really special to be able to spend this last Ivies with my team and finishing my college career at Ivies,” Guo said. “It’s a great atmosphere, bringing out team spirit.”
Following the loss of the trophy to the repeating champion Princeton squad, Harvard and its new additions will look to rebound next season to return the trophy to Cambridge, where it resided from 2012 to 2016.
“We have four freshmen joining us next year and they are all amazing players,” Zhou said. “I’m looking forward to it.”

Freshman or not, by now, we all know the painful truth about reading period. That sweet week of no classes is almost as much of a myth as grade inflation. Reading period is essentially the cram week of hell—a week of failed attempts to study, a few nights of actually studying out of desperation, with deadlines for papers and projects sprinkled in between. With all that’s going on, it can get so overwhelming that you find yourself suddenly having a breakdown in a corner of Lamont at 4 a.m.
The best way to prevent such a scenario is caring for yourself. Self-care is more important than ever during finals week, and good mental health can actually improve your work ethic, studying, and performance. Who would have thought, right? So push aside those practice problems for a minute, take a deep breath, and learn how you can optimize the precious hours of your reading period—without sacrificing your will to live.
Have at least one outing
It doesn’t matter how busy you are. There are 24 hours in a day, and during those seven days during reading period, you have time for at least one off-campus adventure with your friends. Even if it means simply having lunch in Boston with your blocking group, stepping out of the Harvard bubble can make you feel refreshed and realize that the world is bigger than one grade in an Ec course. You’ll come back to campus rejuvenated and ready to hit the books.
Have an indoor spa night
However rewarding city outings may be, self-care is best when your wallet is happy. Another option is to just spend a night in your room treating yourself. Take a hot shower, put on a face mask, play that episode on Netflix you’ve been meaning to watch, and just unwind for an hour or two. When you’re stressed and tired, your work performance and efficiency suffers as well. Taking some time to relax can actually save you time in the long run.
Meditate
This is a quick, easy, and free way to treat yourself. Just download a meditation app and take a minute to breathe in….and out…..in…..and out. Meditation can be a solo activity or done with a small group, but it’s a time for you to focus on nothing but yourself, your mind, and your body. With a clearer mind, you just might figure out how to solve that orgo problem.
Engage in artistic expression
Fear not: you don’t have to be an artistic prodigy to participate in making art. Whether it’s painting, doodling, journaling, or writing creative stories, funneling your emotions into a creative outlet is proven to be cathartic and rewarding. When you haven’t made progress on your final paper after five hours of staring at a blank screen, taking a break to freewrite or draw can stir the creative juices necessary to brainstorm ideas.
Whatever you choose to do, just remember that balance is key. A happy heart leads to a happy mind. Study hard, everyone, and godspeed. We’re almost there.
