Maybe most people go to MoMA for the van Gogh or Matisse or Monet, but I’m there for the scrawny “She-Goat,” a Picasso sculpture crafted from found objects. It’s not because it’s a Picasso. It’s because when my dad was a New York kid, 40 years before I was a New York kid, he used to leave the starving metal creature apples in hopes it might get enough meat on its bones to keep its rib cage from growing. Unsurprisingly, his efforts were in vain.
But that type of memory is what makes MoMA: It’s a museum where art can get personal. The new Diller Scofidio + Renfro/Gensler renovation, a $450 million project to boost gallery space by 30 percent and attendance by a sixth, opened Oct. 21 — and should be judged by whether or not it helps the museum achieve that primary goal, of fostering intimate, even idiosyncratic relationships between art and viewer. I can’t be sure without visiting in person, but I’ll hazard a guess and say it does.
Unlike the most recent MoMA expansion, Taniguchi’s 2004 effort, there’s not a major flaw in the DS+R design which critics latch onto. (For Taniguchi, it was the cavernous atrium which did little to make the space feel massive and inviting because it trapped visitors on crowded narrow walkways between even more crowded escalators.) Architecture critic Michael Kimmelman calls the sleek, cold spaces “slightly soulless.” Art critic Roberta Smith dismisses the reorganization of the galleries to de-emphasize canonical art movements as a way to “protect visitors from what they do not know.” Reporter Robin Pogrebin describes eager visitors stymied by the now gigantic institution’s clunky fold-out maps and insufficient signage.
I’m unconvinced. If soulless in architectural conception, the new galleries are filled in with soul from end to end. In taking masterpieces out of the proverbial boxes, curators were careful to highlight the contributions of a more diverse set of artists, aiming to disrupt the narrative of white, Western men as the creators and inheritors of the artistic canon. They added new satellite shows and commissions. They declared that they’ll rehang a third of the permanent collection galleries every six months. In the process, sure, themes and motifs take precedence over movements, but it’s all part of the attempt to reimagine modern art; if the experiment fails and visitors crave historical clarity, curators will likely address it in the next rehanging. If MoMA needed more physical space for this more expansive curatorial thinking, what the space looks like (within reason) is almost irrelevant.
Navigation will undoubtedly prove a challenge for visitors, but hasn’t it always? Even for a semi-regular like me, the museum is too big to have a handle on once I’ve passed under the familiar hanging helicopter in the lobby — which, thank goodness, remains in place as a landmark.
The one change which does upset me slightly is the sculpture garden’s shrinkage. DS+R didn’t give “She-Goat” enough room to frolic. But that’s okay: She’s probably too exhausted, anyway. Next time I’m back home, I’ll bring her an apple.

“Do.”
These were the two letters Harry Styles tweeted on Oct. 5 to tease the release of his long awaited single, “Lights Up,” sending fans into a frenzy.
Coming off the heels of a two-year hiatus after his self-titled debut solo album, the single’s drop on Oct. 11 shattered expectations while remaining characteristically Harry. With its focus on catchy melodies and saturated harmonies, it marks a departure from his rock n’ roll-tinged debut, yet maintains the distinct air of melancholia from his debut. “All the lights couldn't put out the dark / Runnin' through my heart,” he sings.
Throughout the song, Styles croons over an endlessly catchy beat with lyrics of self-acceptance and self-love: “Shine, step into the light / Shine, so bright sometimes / Shine, I’m not ever going back.”
He sings of coming to terms with and having pride in one’s own identity. This seems to be a major theme in the forthcoming album and Styles’s public life as a whole. With his trademark slogan, “Treat People With Kindness,” the launch of his website doyouknowwhoyouare.com through which fans receive compliments from Styles himself, and his promoting of various issues from Black Lives Matter to LGBTQ+ rights on stage, Styles is making strides towards creating a culture of acceptance and love among his fans — and it seems, himself.
As often happens with anything Styles does, fans quickly jumped to speculate on the meaning of the single’s lyrics, especially because it was released on National Coming Out Day. Many fans believe this was Styles’s own way of coming out, though nothing has been confirmed. This belief was only heightened by the single’s music video, featuring a sweaty, slicked-up Styles standing shirtless in the middle of a pulsing throng of semi-nude men AND women. Some have gone so far as to declare the song a bisexual anthem. Though rumors about Styles’s sexuality have been widespread even from his days in One Direction, he has never confirmed or denied them, adamantly refusing to put a label on it, choosing instead to remain ambiguous with his characteristically glittery suits and painted nails.
There are no dates set for the upcoming and no doubt highly-anticipated album, but fans can expect a shift away from the ’70s rock persona he adopted in songs such as “Kiwi” and “Carolina” to a more RnB vibe. If “Lights Up” is any clue, the album will move away from guitar solos and piano-heavy ballads à la “Sign of the Times” to more pop-heavy tracks, accented with bubblegum synths and syncopating drum loops. It seems to be almost a homage to his beginnings as a pop artist. Though the song retains certain artistic aspects that characterized the previous album, including Styles’s use of gospel-like choruses, previously seen in the beginning of “Only Angel,” it sounds much more processed. Gone seem to be the funky guitar riffs of “Woman” and the peaceful finger-picking of “Sweet Creature,” replaced instead by pulsing basslines much more reminiscent of mainstream pop music.
In a way, the single and its implications for the future album serve as a sort of homecoming for Styles. The song seems to seamlessly blend elements of quintessential Styles as he’s evolved throughout his career. It brings in elements of his past pop career and mixes them with the edgier and more mature sound of his self-titled album. While he sings about acceptance and self-love, the music itself is a testament to this very acceptance. In essence, “Lights Up” is a marriage of the two distinct parts of his career and his identity, bringing these aspects together into an instant hit.

The first eight seconds of the trailer for the new animated film “Onward” feel like Disney Pixar bread and butter. A horde of centaurs, chests bare and hair flowing, gallop through a picturesque field. Atop a mountain in the distance, a stately, sprawling castle stands proudly, so perfectly generic that it could be the home of any Disney royalty. A wizard wielding a dark, curling scepter sends plumes of vibrant fireworks rocketing toward the heavens, as a booming narrator explains, “In times of old, the world was full of wonder and magic...”
But then, something new. An airplane jets past the cotton candy clouds. Vast hills are replaced by rows of matching houses, with neatly cropped gardens and attached garages. The homes still look like any fairy or dwarf could dwell within their walls, yet telephone wires crisscross the sky and a water tower looms in the distance. Pixar’s self-described “suburban fantasy world” is populated with magical creatures; the protagonists in fact are a family of elves, but they are profoundly normal. The mother, voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, dances on a yoga mat to an ’80s style workout tape in a living room cluttered with knick knacks. If the characters' skin weren’t tinted blue and their ears didn’t extend to neat, rosy points, this could be any home.
This film will not chronicle the journey of a hero fated to save the world through some dramatic adventure. Instead, it is Ian Lightfoot’s sixteenth birthday and his mother reveals that his late father left a gift for him and his boisterous older brother Barley, voiced by Chris Pratt. The three are dumbfounded when they discover that the gift is a wooden wizard’s staff with instructions for its use: a spell that will bring their father back to life for one day. Ian, voiced by Tom Holland, beloved by Disney fans for his portrayal of Spiderman in the newest Avengers installments, is sure to grab hearts as his character, wide eyed and with cheeks flushed, asks, “I’m gonna meet Dad?”
However, it couldn’t be too simple or there wouldn’t be a movie, and the trailer humorously shows the moment when things go seriously awry. In an explosion of sparks and vivid color, the magical staff halts part way through the spell, with only their father’s legs having been generated. Thus, the Lightfoots set off on a journey with the sentient pair of pants to somehow bring back the rest of him.
The trailer’s final scene highlights what will likely be the movie’s core, the relationship between the Lightfoot brothers. Casting Holland and Pratt was a savvy decision from both a cinematic and a marketing standpoint, as their chemistry is apparent, evincing a brotherly familiarity that is earnest and endearing. And as the Marvel films have a passionate and enthusiastic fan base that eats up “bromances” between stars like Holland and Pratt, this film could entice moviegoers from an older, broader demographic to join its viewing audience.
With a star studded cast that also includes Octavia Spencer as “the Manticore,” this movie has the potential to become Disney’s latest smash hit. It has the exciting, voyaging quality of many of its predecessors, and yet the unique nature of its characters and setting may allow it to create its own legacy. While it takes place in a world in which magic is almost gone, it seems the Disney magic is still alive.

The problem with the movie “After” is so much deeper than its generic plot. On the surface, “After” seems like so many films before it, a guilty pleasure watch: objectively, critically worthless yet fun to watch, and overall, harmless. The film’s protagonist is Tessa Young (Josephine Langford), an innocent, rosy-cheeked college freshman, who dresses in pastels and lace to ensure that it is abundantly clear how stereotypically naive she is. The plot centers around Tessa’s discovery that there is so much more to life than the banality of her relationship with her bland boyfriend and the exhaustion of bearing the brunt of her mother’s expectations. Obviously her eyes are opened by a fiery relationship with Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin), a stock character bad boy with a British accent and a host of tattoos. A sheltered goody two shoes meets a rebellious heart throb and falls for him instantly? Groundbreaking.
Now, one would be remiss not to absolve the actors of guilt here. Like many, they are doing the best they can with characters lacking in complexity and a plot that is almost nonexistent. The entire movie feels like it’s building up to a grand reveal, and when it comes, it is shockingly lackluster. It won’t be spoiled here, though, if it were, would it even matter? You will likely see it coming. If anything, the actors can only be faulted for reading this script and signing onto the project. All of this being said, it is their earnest, heartfelt performances that actually render this movie watchable.
The problem with “After” lies in its origins. It is based on a series of books by Anna Todd that were first published online as Harry Styles fanfiction — a genre often written by a fan of a particular movie or television series, in which the already existing characters are included in the author’s plot. It is essentially writing with only 50 percent of the work. One has to create plot, but the characters do not have to be thought up, described, or developed. It seems fairly harmless; who can be faulted for wanting to read a happy ending for a character that died tragically, for example? And yet, this subject becomes murkier when entering a realm in which fanfiction is written about actual, living human beings. While some take the argument that celebrities give a certain amount of themselves over to the public, this point, while understandable when it comes to paparazzi photos and public fan encounters, doesn’t quite hold water here.
People are not fictional characters. If one rewrites a character’s ending, or romantically fixes up characters that were not paired in the original work, the act is fairly victimless. The only risk they run is that they may anger other passionate fans that disagree with their creative direction. “Fifty Shades of Gray” famously began as “Twilight” fanfiction. However, fictionalizing real people is playing with live ammo. So when one writes a series of books, let alone one that is read over a billion times, enough to garner a book deal and a feature film adaptation, that is about a real human, it feels dangerously untrue.
In Anna Todd’s original stories, Harry Styles, whose name is changed to Hardin Scott in the formally, traditionally published versions, has been categorized by many as verbally abusive. Some have even argued that the actions of the character perpetuate rape culture, and feature a story which promotes toxic and damaging relationships. Many fans of the singer have urged others in their community not to support the film, arguing that it will cloud other’s perceptions of their beloved star. And while so many of their tweets may sound juvenile, they actually hit the nail on the head, which is more than can be said of the author herself. When asked about her story’s origins and the complexity of portraying a character who is widely known to be more than inspired by a genuine person, Todd said, “I love Harry Styles just as much as anyone, and I would never do anything that would hurt his feelings.” Todd sounds more immature than the actual teenage fans. Her admiration for Styles isn’t the point. The risk isn’t in “hurting his feelings.” The risk is that others will see a character clearly based on a real person and associate the negative, damaging actions of the character with him, despite the fact that they don’t even purport to be based on factual information.
While the New York Times made clear that free speech protects the depiction of real people as fictional characters, these legal distinctions were likely intended for those that write books based on personal experience, who are at least claiming to depict people that they have genuinely known or situations that could have happened. Fanfiction exists in a gray area because it quite literally concerns events that undisputedly never happened. In addition, fanfiction is a fairly new phenomenon that did predate libel laws which dictate what can and cannot be written. How do we legislate what can be written about real people, using their real names, creating any scenario they’d like? Someone could write a story describing Taylor Swift or Ariana Grande committing murder, for example. In fact, many of those works likely exist, pages and pages gathering dust in some dark corner of the world wide web.
So really, we should not focus on “After” because it is unoriginal, boring, and bland. We should focus on “After” because it highlights a clear oversight in modern society. Because the fact of the matter is, when “After” was released online, one chapter at a time, it did garner over a billion views and readers added six million comments along the way. All the while, Todd was allowed to describe Harry Styles’s appearence, and use his real name. So even if the character wasn’t problematic, even if she wrote him as a generous, kind soul who should be made into a saint, wouldn’t that still not be okay? Is it not a supreme violation of his personal autonomy? Films and books are allowed to be bad. After all, “bad” is completely subjective. But when did we decide that they were allowed to be wrong, admittedly and with zero accountability, with the names and faces of real people?

This autumn, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has a plethora of new exhibitions. In addition to several new, comprehensive displays of art — including a showcase of Nubian art and a cross-section honoring oft-overlooked female artists — on Saturday, the MFA launched three new exhibitions: one on contemporary art, one on African aestheticism, and one on the mouths of women.
The last of these, titled “Read My Lips,” is an immersive visual-auditory experience. It revolves around the idea of women’s lips, which have traditionally been viewed as vehicles for erotic actualization. The exhibit contrasts this sensual ideal with the stereotypical perception of the female voice, typically characterized as strident or screeching.
“The four videos installed in the Krupp Gallery consider the female voice — where it’s accepted and how it’s suppressed; its treatment as simultaneously alluring and repulsive; and its relationship to the body,” the MFA’s description of the exhibit reads.
The exhibit consists of four videos by female artists playing in loop in a small, dark room. Printed on the back wall, in bright pink text, is a quote from Bella Abzug, an American social activist and lawyer.
“Women have been trained to speak and carry a lipstick. Those days are over,” the quote reads.
Abzug plays a dominant role, in fact, in one of the artist’s pieces. Her words are concomitant with a greater theme — the politicization of women’s voices — throughout the exhibit. A display by Sharon Hayes compiles a transcript of a conversation between Abzug and her voice coach, formatted like a retro teleprompter.
In keeping with Abzug’s voice training, other pieces in the exhibit highlight and accentuate gender performance. One of the works of art, a video entitled “Hand to Mouth” by artist Patty Chang, features an off-screen hand thoroughly dousing the artist with a balloon filled with water and helium. The artist shot the piece on Super 8 video film, and in doing so, imitated a cheap pornographical movie. Chang herself spends the entire film shouting and whipping her head back and forth.
“Give it to me, come on, come on!” Chang shouts.
Similarly, Marilyn Minter’s film “Green Pink Caviar” features a woman’s mouth lapping up and spitting out pink, green, silver, and gold slime. Her lips press against the screen, both flattened and enlarged. Before featuring in the exhibit, the video formerly played on commercialized billboards in Sunset Boulevard and Times Square.
All pieces explore the female voice as a concept and communal experience. The exhibit attempts to connect to the women coming in and out of the museum and their shared experiences of sexualization or repression. A video by VALIE EXPORT, an Austrian artist, films a female larynx opening and closing as the artist recounts a poem. The oration sounds as if the narrator is choking, airways constricted.
“I’ve hardly spoken a sound and already it’s gone,” the orator says.
As visitors to the MFA passed in and out of the exhibit, they had varying reactions to the pieces. Many spent a significant amount of time at each individual piece. Others came into the exhibit, saw the mouths, and left almost immediately. Visitor Kristina Bronson said she took issue with the element of the grotesque in the exhibit, and felt that it had gone too far in deromanticizing women’s mouths.
“I’m disappointed to see that the images are so unappealing,” Bronson said.
But other guests said they were intrigued by the exhibit’s viscerality.
“At first it seems really aggressive. It’s really in-your-face, like experimental theater, almost,” museum-goer Isabella Ingham said.

Disney released the trailer for the final film of the Star Wars saga, “The Rise of Skywalker,” on Oct. 21, giving plenty for both casual fans and aficionados of all ages to peruse over the next two months. It’s almost an understatement to say that this trailer is packed, two minutes crammed with all the staples that define the Star Wars franchise. Action and nostalgia are something this film promises in full.
If it wasn’t clear already, Rey (Daisy Ridley) will be the core of this film. She might be the last of the Jedi, and going off the trailer, she seems in for a whirlwind of an experience. She appears to be embarking on the solitary adventures that define the Jedi experience. We see her running through a forest that evokes Endor (will the Ewoks return?), exploring a cavernous building, and climbing aboard something like a partially submerged spaceship. She appears to be gearing up for one climactic fight (more on that later). And Rey reminds us we still don’t know much about her: “People keep telling me they know me. But no one does.”
But what’s Star Wars without companions, and Rey has many in the Resistance, new and old. There’s Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Issac), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), and BB-8 – the now-familiar faces (and droid) of the new generation. There are the beloved faces, voices, and droids of lore, too: Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), for starters, and even Lando Carrisian (Billy Dee Williams) returns after a nearly four-decade absence. At the end of the trailer, we hear Luke (Mark Hamill) say, “The force will be with you.”
“Always,” Leia adds.
C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) will likely drive fans into a panic with these words: “I’m taking one last look, sir, at my friends.”
And lest we forget that Star Wars is a fine-tuned money-making machine, a fuzzy little creature to warm the hearts and headline the Christmas wish lists of children worldwide is here again, too. At first, I foolishly thought I had gotten through the trailer with no cuddly creature in sight. But upon further examination, I realized the franchise that introduced us to Ewoks and Porgs had struck again. A diminutive, big-eyed creature sat perched on C-3PO’s shoulders, fixing the droid’s wires (Babu Frik, as he’s apparently known, already has a “Wookieepedia” page).
A heroine, of course, needs her villain, and it looks like we have two. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) returns to be Rey’s foil. Everything appears set for one last fight between the two — apparently in the ruins of the old Death Star, no less, where Luke and Darth Vader battled in “Return of the Jedi.” Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is back, too, sinister and foreboding as always. “Long I have waited. And now, your coming together is your undoing,” he warns.
This trailer – to borrow Donald Rumsfeld’s immortal words – leaves us with many “known unknowns,” and invariably many “unknown unknowns” as well. There’s only so much to glean from two minutes of probably misleadingly cut film clips. So with John Williams’s grand, sentimental reworking of his famous theme and plenty of visual and verbal teasers, one is left waiting and expectant for the final reveal.

Few periods of time stick in our minds as clearly as the tween years of 2012 and 2013. Cliques formed in school, kids threw raucous bar and bat mitzvahs, and many felt the awkward urge to ask middle school crushes to slow dance to Lil Wayne’s “How to Love.”
Many early 2010s albums received universal critical acclaim and will live on through their legacy. “Modern Vampires of the City” and “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” along with several others, are such examples. But the public should focus its attention not only on those excellent albums, but also on the music that dominated sweaty middle school dances and carpools for the early part of the decade. This music raised a generation of kids.
5. “What Makes You Beautiful,” One Direction (2011)
The five Brits rose to stardom in 2011 upon the release of their inescapable first hit. Seemingly, every middle schooler had a strong opinion on the band. Now, all of the members have gone their separate ways, but the couple of years that One Direction occupied countless iPod Touch backgrounds will not be forgotten.
4. “Teenage Dream,” Katy Perry (2010)
Katy Perry made everyone want to achieve their own respective teenage dream. This song, looking back, seems simple and almost innocent compared to a lot of contemporary pop music, but through that innocence, it manages to capture the feeling of growing up in 2010. People worried about the mundane, lived hopeful lives, and devoured Ken Burns’ recently-released six-hour documentary “The Tenth Inning.”
3. “Stereo Hearts,” Gym Class Heroes (2011)
My sixth grade English teacher used this song to introduce students to figurative language. Through the deeply profound metaphor of the stereo representing the most passionate recesses of the human heart and lyrics like “And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me/When you have to purchase mad D batteries,” Gym Class Heroes established themselves as key literary voices for the turn of the decade. The song also foreshadowed Adam Levine’s rapid rise in fame over the decade.
2. “Gangnam Style,” PSY (2012)
This hit transcended the Korean market that it was initially released for, becoming both an internet craze and a musical phenomenon. The song and its accompanying video are goofy, but “Gangnam Style” was an indicator of a legitimate trend: American charts would open up to non-English language hits like “Despacito” later in the decade.
1. “Fire Burning,” Sean Kingston (2009)
Yes, the most important song of the early 2010s was released before 2010, but nobody can deny the ubiquity of this song at the time. Tell an early-2010s middle school dance attendee the phrase “Somebody call 9-1-1,” and most would respond with “shawty fire burning on the dancefloor” rather than calling the appropriate authorities. Besides, nothing strikes more fear into a tween’s heart than seeing an overzealous parent running to the center of the dancefloor, and “Fire Burning” had an incredible power to make middle-aged bar mitzvah attendees do just that.

Loud, teenage music listening habits are often used as the scapegoat in conversations revolving around hearing loss and age, but New Yorker staff writer David Owen reasons that avoiding loud and potentially damaging sounds is difficult for everyone in his book, “Volume Control: Hearing in a Deafening World.” Owen imparts immense knowledge of the topic of hearing onto readers through a series of informative chapters filled with readable articulations of research and down-to-earth anecdotes. In essence, he cogently interweaves witty reflection with social commentary whilst unraveling the elaborate details of human hearing.
Likely drawing from his experience as a staff writer for the New Yorker, Owen is not afraid to broadcast his thoughts on society as a critique of human behavior. He acknowledges the privilege afforded to the baby boomer generation as it relates to capitalism “magically” creating solutions to their problems as they arise. Owen writes that, “Now that we’re losing our hearing, the market has turned its attention to our ears, with which we’ve been as reckless as we have been with the earth’s once seemingly inexhaustible store of natural resources.” His ability to situate environmental issues and economics within a discussion about hearing loss is quite remarkable, considering these two issues on the surface appear unrelated.
Like many books of this type, Owen draws much of his content from anecdotes he encountered in his research. Although this format becomes somewhat predictable after six chapters of reading, it is clear that Owen cherry-picked the most engrossing and stimulating accounts for those featured in the book in order to avoid monotony. With stories ranging from his friends’ earwax extraction to his grandmother’s hunting date that proved detrimental to her hearing, it is hard to imagine a more effective method of covering the subject of hearing.
Owen evenly spaces his conversation of human hearing as the novel progresses in a somewhat sequential structure. This structure works well for this book and is almost undoubtedly conventional despite the fact that there is little precedent for this type of exploration into the subject. That is, very few pieces of writing attempt to delve deep into the science of hearing and progress to a discussion of solutions to varying levels of hearing loss in the way that “Volume Control” does. To demonstrate, where else can one find a sentence that reads, “The cochlea occupies a small cavity in an exceptionally unyielding part of the skull, a pyramid-shaped structure known as the petrous part of the temporal bone” in the same book that contains the sentences, “Hearphones, legally speaking, are not hearing aids. But they used the same microprocessor that hearing aids do, and, although they aren’t promoted that way, they address the same issues?” Although “Volume Control” technically cannot be classified as a novel, Owen does incorporate a novel combination of research into his book.
Periodic digression in Owen’s book seamlessly aligns with his structured presentation of research in a way that amplifies his personal voice and serves as “Volume Control”’s version of comic relief. For example, Owen alludes to common topics of debate throughout the book. “An occasional activity for my friends and me, when we were lads, was to consider whether we’d prefer to be frozen to death or burned, hanged or guillotined, shot by a firing squad or drowned — a classic sleepover thought problem.” This story’s charm lies in the genuine portrayal of adolescent conversation that transcends its morbid topic. Owen also writes, “The answer to the old brainteaser about a tree falling in a forest — if there’s no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? — is no.” Tangents like these effortlessly give the book character.
This book addresses the implications of hearing loss in our society with the clarity of Owen’s salient journalism. Those who happen upon this book will be treated with a wealth of knowledge and hope for future hearing technologies. Owen manages to break down the complex subject of human hearing into chewable bites of information, which sets “Volume Control” apart from the vast amount of esoteric literature on the subject.

“Scandalous” aims for piping-hot controversy, but settles instead for lukewarm praise.
The documentary chronicles the rise and fall of the salacious National Enquirer, one of the most sensational, prurient, and exploitative publications in the history of the United States. The film follows the newspaper from its origin as a more serious journalistic periodical under the name the New York Enquirer, to a grisly “gore rag,” to a celebrity gossip magazine. The documentary glosses its various headlines and scandals over the years, from the death of John Belushi to the O.J. Simpson trial.
The documentary also acts, in large part, as a justification for yellow journalism, or journalism founded upon hyperbolic caricature rather than, frequently, actual fact. The National Enquirer is famous for its staggeringly lurid headlines, many of which feature prominently throughout the documentary. It’s a tabloid based on shock value and insidious backroom deals, and often, the actions of the journalists and staff were just as sordid as the celebrities themselves.
The documentary argues that aspects of the National Enquirer’s particular brand of journalism are not only understandable, but also justifiable. It spends considerable time lauding the benefits of a career as a National Enquirer journalist — the travel to luxurious destinations, the considerable paycheck, and the glamour of being on a first-name basis with celebrities. It even commends the journalistic integrity, in part, of Enquirer reporters and photographers who covered high-profile events like O.J. Simpson trial, where newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post also vied for coverage.
What makes this argument ineffective, however, is that the documentary does not fully commit to its own stance. Rather, it toes the line between firmly advocating for and against the Enquirer, settling on an equivocal middle ground. This obscurity produces a murky, uncertain final message. Was the Enquirer a pioneer of its time? It did, after all, expand from typical news subjects and reach a more general audience in a deeply personal sense — lighter, fluffier news was far more palatable to the average reader than complex political examinations or depressing violence and despair.
But “Scandalous” also makes an argument that the tabloid contributed to the fake-news mass-media sensation that has come to define journalism of the 21st century. The whole point of “Scandalous” seems to be that the Enquirer was a sort of ambivalent phenomenon that was neither good nor bad, but rather simply influential. The documentary does not, however, address this dubiety effectively — it diverts its efforts from the examination of media ethics to the coverage of various celebrity horror stories, from Marla Maples, to Whitney Houston, to Arnold Schwarzenneger.
Perhaps more problematic than its uncertainty in judging the merits or demerits of the Enquirer, however, is that “Scandalous” ultimately fails to emanate the voyeuristic pleasure of the tabloid itself. In a very real sense, the Enquirer has a rich history fraught with extortion and blackmail; it has leveraged secrets of infidelity and drug usage against celebrities like Bob Hope, Bill Cosby, and Jeff Bezos, all with varying degrees of success. The way in which these tales are related fails to grasp the unique pleasure in assuaging one’s own boredom by peering into the colorful lives of the rich and famous.
Furthermore, instead of delving deep into the politics within the tabloid, “Scandalous” focuses on trivial anecdotes from the magazine’s golden age, when its circulation numbers were not in the thousands, but rather in the millions. In doing so, it fundamentally loses the rich opportunity to expose more about the drama behind the publication itself.
There are moments within “Scandalous” that ring true. One of the most compelling aspects of the film are the interviews of tabloid journalists, who relate conflicts of journalistic integrity and the lengths to which they had to go in order to cover a good story. In attempting to uncover the death of John Belushi, for example, several journalists befriended Catherine Evelyn Smith, his drug dealer, and coerced her into a confession that would eventually land her in jail. There is an enduring, provocative question throughout the documentary of when enough is enough, when a reporter has finally gone too far — the long-debated role of the “Enquirer” in the Princess Diana scandal is a perfect example. Do celebrities have to pay a price for their fame? Are tabloids truly responsible for their ultimate downfall?
“Scandalous” is neither a particularly great documentary nor a strikingly bad one. Rather, it remains somewhere in-between. It lacks, somewhat ironically, the striking shock value of the Enquirer itself.

The women of “Ordinary Girls” are anything but ordinary. Jaquira Díaz’s memoir chronicles the vibrant color, joy, and tragedy of a life lived with inimitable passion. She charts, with poetic precision, a childhood spent in the housing projects of Puerto Rico and Miami Beach, a peripatetic adolescence of substance abuse and swinging fists, and an unexpected adulthood as an accomplished writer. Díaz does not shy away from difficult themes and topics: Rather, her memoir embraces the violence, poverty, addiction, sexual assault, and mental illnesses that shaped, if not her current life, at least her origins.
Díaz is an accomplished writer. Her work has been featured in numerous publications, including “The Best American Essays 2016” and Rolling Stone. She has received two Pushcart Prizes and multiple fellowships and grants. Now, she is also a formidable memoirist.
What makes Díaz’s memoir so compelling is, in the most fundamental sense, that it is not just about herself. She titled this book “Ordinary Girls,” after all. Her tale is at once a chilling study of a family dissolved by schizophrenia and infidelity, an anthropological dissertation of poverty and immigration, and a bildungsroman. In broadening the scope of her narrative, she embraces a paradoxically-personal anonymity: These things happen to other girls, other people, Díaz seems to say. This story doesn’t just belong to me.
In some ways, Díaz merely acts as a lens through which to tell the histories of others. She describes her mother vividly, oftentimes as an entity completely separate from herself. “[M]y mother owned every room she walked into,” Díaz writes. “She eclipsed the sun with her confidence.” She details her mother’s transformation from an evocative, evanescent force of nature to a woman broken and beaten by addiction and schizophrenia, a metamorphosis so powerful that it attains a plot line all its own, a digression from Díaz’s more personal development.
Díaz gives a similar attention and care to the trials and tribulations of other important figures in her life: her father’s transformation from a Puerto Rican revolutionary into a disenchanted womanizer, her ex-boyfriend Kilo’s evolution from a bitter youth into an early father, and her grandmother Mercy’s suicide. These figures take up pages of their own, equally as important to Díaz’s maturation as Díaz herself. Throughout her memoir, in fact, Díaz discovers and comprehends herself through her relation to others. In recalling a particular encounter with Kilo, she reflects, “That’s when it would hit me, that Kilo wasn’t that different from me, that maybe back then he’d also been dreaming about dying.”
Perhaps most striking about “Ordinary Girls,” though, is its lack of conventionality. It reads like a collection of personal essays rather than one cohesive narrative, perhaps naturally concomitant with Díaz’s resume. It also progresses pseudo-chronologically: Different periods of time overlap within each chapter, past and present and future converging all at once.
Which is not to say that the memoir lacks organization. Far from it, in fact — Díaz assembles “Ordinary Girls” much more by theme than by time period, a unique and surprisingly effective choice. Some chapters deal with sexual assault, others with certain members of her family — one chapter, entitled “Mother, Mercy” revolves around her grandmother’s choice to take her own life — and still others with juvenile deliquency.
In keeping with this unorthodox arrangement, “Ordinary Girls” is full of bold choices and experimentation. Díaz favors writing in second-person, but instead of addressing the reader, she speaks to her past self: “Fourteen. You’ll drink and fight, get high and fight. Fifteen. You’ll spend days smoking haze with your homeboy.” It’s a method that is particularly suited to a memoir that deals with intense personal development in which there is, at all times, a palpable gap between the professional writer and the angry teenager with a rap sheet and the naive child. There is such growth between all of these stages that they represent different people altogether, an idea capitalized upon when an adult Díaz dresses up as her adolescent self for Halloween.
But the best part about “Ordinary Girls” is its all-encompassing anonymity. Díaz begins and ends her story with “we,” first-person plural: “We were the wild girls who loved music and dancing,” she writes in the first chapter and at the end, she notes, “We are women now.”
It’s a story much broader than Díaz herself, more universal, even, than the sisters — both biological and not, found in school and on the streets — that feature so prominently throughout the memoir. “Ordinary Girls” is about a collective group who come from broken families, homes, and relationships. It’s about the ones who make it to womanhood, and, in conspicuous absence, about the ones who don’t.
It’s a story about sisterhood, which is an inclusive concept in name and in practice. This is not an undirected memoir of rampant narcissism; the whole point of “Ordinary Girls” is that Díaz did not stumble through her life on her own. It’s a collective, communal tale of death and survival and scars, about what it means to be a woman and what it means to love and what it means to hate and hit and shout. It’s not just poignant, but also deeply poetic and proud, and that is precisely what makes it such a provocative, prepossessing read.

Your professor is running late, your TF is snoozing in the back row, and that first-year just spilled their granola yoghurt down their new Coop sweatshirt. Where could it be but your 9 a.m. class? Every weekday at 8:30 a.m. (or 8:45, if you live life on the edge), campus kids across all 12 houses drag themselves off of their musty sheets and trundle into sweaty lecture halls to get educated.
Within these hallowed halls lie the secrets of science and philosophy that can unlock a lifetime of learning (or a lucrative career at a big three firm); these worthy pursuits keep our alarms early and our naps plentiful — but at what cost? As icy winds close in and Canada Geese proliferate, the endless trudge to class — be it Northwest or Vanserg — looks less appealing with each passing day.
Fear no longer, fellow students. Studies* have shown this playlist, used in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise, increases walking speed by up to 70 percent, and almost doubles early morning productivity. Rise and shine! Your days of morning lethargy and procrastination are over.
*sample size of one
“Acceptable in the 80s” by Calvin Harris
Know this — Calvin Harris was a mere 22 when he crafted the electroclash symphony that is his debut album “I Created Disco” — and on computer that looked like this. Indeed “Acceptable in the 80s” is breathtaking in its artistic scope, from the iconic retro sound aesthetic to the dissection of a sock-puppet genet in its now-legendary music video. To be frank, the bravery of a young Harris in pursuing his singular artistic vision alone should be a motivation to leg it to campus in the morning — but some throwback synth goodness couldn’t hurt either.
“Ice Cream” (Featuring Matias Aguayo) by Battles
For when a good morning isn’t enough, the impeccably paced alt-rock introduction of “Ice Cream” by Battles is the sonic manifestation of sheer, unadulterated light, instantly transporting the listener into a state of uncontrollable catharsis. Since its release in 2011, experts have debated whether this song should come with a content warning due to its ability to induce borderline spasmic joy. Listen with caution.
“Unsquare Dance” by The Dave Brubeck Quartet
Described by Brubeck himself as a “challenge to the foot-tappers, finger-snappers and hand-clappers”, “Unsquare Dance” is not your average boot-stomper — far from it, the Quartet’s edgy groove will have you concocting intricate footwork across the red-brick paths of Cambridge.
“Vroom Vroom” by Charli XCX
For those of us that cannot afford to roll up to class in a lavender lamborghini, let us live vicariously through Charli XCX and her hyper-pop perfect world of sparse beats and blue bikinis. XCX’s output may be of particular interest to those in the social sciences — described by one journalist as a “party anthropologist,” Charlie XCX serves as a reminder to all of us that wisdom can come from all sorts of places, from Sever 202 to an 808 drum.
“Dance This Mess Around” by The B-52’s
Thanks to their relentless surf-rock basslines and liberal usage of kitschy sunshine-yellow on album covers, The B-52’s are a no-brainer when it comes to morning pump-up anthems. Like many of their songs, “Dance This Mess Around” is a certifiable new-wave bop, but with a twist — Cindy Wilson’s effortless screamo in the chorus is nothing short of visceral, leaving the listener unsure whether to dance, or simply quiver in amazement at the artistic achievement that is The B-52’s entire musical output. Just the kind of primal energy you need for your 9 a.m. Intro Spanish drill section.

Last week in my review, I complained that the Farm plotline had run its course and seemed pretty bland compared to all the other craziness going on in “Riverdale.” While the Farm and cult leader Edgar Evernever (Chad Michael Murray) have their moments — mainly moments of absolute absurdity — it makes perfect sense why this anti-climatic resolution, which should be season finale content, is relegated to the third episode of the season.
For one, the Farm as a storyline has taken advantage of viewer’s suspension of disbelief. Sure, “Riverdale” is known for being “out there” (let’s not forget the Gargoyle King), but this organ-harvesting cult is pushing it. At the beginning of the episode, the FBI sends in an agent, pretending to be their pizza delivery guy, and as soon as Evelyn sees his face, Evelyn starts shooting the pizza delivery man. Then Edgar calls Betty (Lili Reinhart) — not the FBI, but a high school student — asking for a quarter of a million dollars, a bus, and passports for the whole cult. It seems absurd to expect Betty to be able to acquire all of this and yet she does: Veronica (Camila Mendes) gives her some fancy eggs, Toni (Vanessa Morgan) knows a guy who can fake passports, and Betty just steals a school bus.
But the icing on the cake is yet to come. Edgar’s endgame is so unbelievably outlandish that one wonders if the writers of the show just put ideas in a hat and pulled some out at random. When Betty and her mom, Alice (Mädchen Amick), are tied up, Alice tells Betty, “Evelyn is going to drive the bus full of Farmies off a cliff as a distraction while he takes off in a rocket.” But it gets worse. Betty asks where he could have bought a rocket and her mom answers, “He’s building one.”
To which Betty responds, “Yeah, because harvesting organs isn’t...isn’t enough.” Honestly, “Riverdale” writers, harvesting organs should have been enough.
Most bothersome about all of this is the fact that the show has totally misused Murray’s surprisingly terrifying acting. He’s been able to pull of a cool, calculating evil mastermind for several episodes now, but in this episode, he’s dressed up in a star spangled banner jumpsuit (please look it up, it’s atrocious) as viewers watch him try to take off in a homemade rocket. A complete waste of a talent no one was really expecting from Murray.
Overlooking Betty’s overinvolvement in what should have been the FBI’s case (they had her diffuse a bomb in a room full of trained agents!), this episode had other problems. Jughead’s (Cole Sprouse) time at Stonewall Prep, a boarding school where he was recruited, is arguably the most eye-roll-worthy of the show. Jughead is roommates with Moose (Cody Kearsley), who has renamed himself (hopefully a tongue-and-cheek joke) Marmaduke. He also starts a feud with “diplo-brat” (a diplomat’s bratty child, apparently) named, what else, Bret (Sean Depner). The feud starts in earnest when Jughead calls Bret’s writing “Salinger-derivative” and honestly, can we blame Bret for hating that? Jughead is simultaneously the new kid and “section kid,” and in Bret’s defense, is also literally the leader of a gang.
Veronica deserves some credit for having the best lines of the show. When Archie (KJ Apa) decides he needs to raise $40,000 for his community center, Veronica propositions a sexy car wash with all the guys shirtless. When they only make $400, however, she says, “I think I overestimated the pull of your pectorals.” The “Riverdale” writers keep making the same mistake, because honestly Archie’s seemingly required 30 seconds of shirtless screentime each episode is getting a bit old. Perhaps the funniest scene of the entire episode takes place when Veronica finds her dad, Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos, at home in his study. “Daddy? You’re supposed to be in jail!” Veronica exclaims.
“Mija, I own that jail,” he responds. Classic Hiram!
Unfortunately, I am sensing that this season plans on doing something weird (again) with Cheryl (Madeline Petsch) and the rest of the Blossom family. There are hints that Cheryl is actually a triplet, not a twin, and Nana Rose (Barbara Wallace) is losing it. Then, a rat jumps out of Jason Blossom’s corpse and Toni finds Cheryl stitching his stomach back together. We’ve had enough of complicated Blossom family trees and can’t we just let poor Nana Rose rest?
All in all, things seem pretty good as far as anyone in Riverdale is concerned. Until, that is, Betty says the unsayable: “I’m just glad this nightmare is finally over!” Oh Betty, this is only Episode Three! Of course, the doorbell rings and Jughead finds a VCR tape on the front porch. “Famous last words,” he says. It truly can only get worse from here.

Sam and Diane. Ross and Rachel. Kermit and Miss Piggy. The “will they, won’t they” odd couple is a staple of television romance, and for good reason: There’s something particularly alluring about not quite knowing what direction a relationship will take.
Given its title, it’s no surprise that Amazon Prime’s “Modern Love” picks up on this dramatic tradition by presenting some unconventional pairings of its own — from a war photographer and a Shakespeare scholar to a young intern and a genius old enough to be her dad. But the show’s greatest “will they, won’t they” doesn’t involve any of its eclectic characters — it’s between the viewer and the show itself. “Modern Love” wants you to fall in love with it; each of its eight episodes is like a date in which the show pulls out all the stops to woo you in just 30 minutes. For the most part, it’s successful. But like any date, there’s the occasional awkward misstep … and maybe just one too many mentions of an ex.
Based on the popular New York Times column of the same name, “Modern Love” puts a spotlight on the ups and downs of today’s relationships — romantic or otherwise. Each of the column’s articles features a different author delivering a real-life account of a brush they have had with love. By pairing some of the most popular articles with some of Hollywood’s most talented actors (hello Anne Hathaway), the Amazon series becomes a delightful lesson in love and loss squared away in a simple four hour package that’s just begging to be binged. This anthological binge-ability does come at a cost, however, since each character and their respective storyline only has a half hour to worm their way into your heart before being forgotten in favor of the next episode’s subject. Fortunately, one thing that “Modern Love” proves time and time again is that it does not take long for the seeds of love and attachment to be planted.
Of course, a good first impression is essential in setting the tone for the rest of any relationship, and “Modern Love”’s courtship of its viewers is no exception. Accordingly, the premiere episode of the show is perfectly crafted to draw you in. “When the Doorman is Your Main Man” is one of the best episodes that the show has to offer. Part of what makes this episode so appealing is its subversion of our assumption that love is inherently romantic. The relationship at the center of the story is not a couple of lovebirds, but a woman and her doorman. This serves as a sign early on that the show has something for everyone, even those ordinarily repelled by “gushy” romantic plots. In fact, it could even be argued that romantic relationships only play a supporting role over the entire series, with the show’s focus instead resting on those platonic, but meaningful, relationships that are too often glossed over.
This first episode gives us another glimmer of hope in the form of a visual gag. At one point, the titular doorman (Laurentiu Possa), who hails from a military family, stares down a man that Maggie (Cristin Milloti) has brought home for the night. Suddenly, his vision changes from that of a normal pair of eyes to the scope of a rifle — accompanied, naturally, by some intense action music. Though this 10-second goof is just a small blip in terms of the entire episode, it provides us with our first glimpse at what makes the show so endearing — “Modern Love” does not take itself too seriously. Whether it’s including subtitles for a dog’s barks, or a full-on musical number that creatively represents a character’s manic episode (hello again, Anne Hathaway), we are constantly reminded that love is, above all else, fun.
But love is complicated, too. “Modern Love” showcases just a sample of the many obstacles that can come between a perfect relationship, from unwanted pregnancies and depressive episodes to hospitalizations and cheating. While love is the unifying theme across the series, the variety of ways in which it can twist and turn sets each episode apart. In fact, each episode is so unique that it feels like a creation of its own, completely independent of the episodes that precede and follow it. The use of flashbacks, point-of-view switches, and narration is remarkably inconsistent, in a way that evokes that distinct voices of the authors upon which the characters are based.
Of course, for every “will they” moment, there are several “won’t they” counterparts that make viewers re-evaluate their initial feelings about the show. As diverse as the situations that our beloved characters encounter are, the characters themselves are not. While the opening theme is a montage that includes lovers of all races, backgrounds, ages, and orientations, the show itself keeps diversity to a minimum. It gets to the point that the show makes you question if it is possible to fall in love if you are not a white, middle-class New Yorker. Though each of these stories is incredibly interesting and worth telling, the show leaves so many types of love unrepresented.
Furthermore, the inconsistency in episode structure extends to episode quality as well. While some manage to leave quite the impression in such a short time frame, others are almost worth skipping. As bold and creative of a choice it is to have an episode focused on a young woman’s “daddy issues,” these innovative intentions do not outweigh the inevitable discomfort that Episode Six heralds. Similarly, not even Tina Fey’s charm can save her from the relatively boring plot, about a middle-aged couple who discovers tennis in Episode Four. The show becomes a sort of minefield where one has to question whether it’s worth setting off a bomb (of an episode) just to get to the good stuff. If there’s one big takeaway from “Modern Love,” however, it’s that true love is worth the trials and tribulations, and perhaps this grace should be extended to the show itself. As long as the series listens to its critics (which means making more Episode Ones and fewer Episode Sixes), “Modern Love” just might be worth calling back for that second date.

Three hours from Dallas, 1964.
“Sure beats the 38th Parallel, don’t it?”
Wansup Shim nodded slowly in agreement, still blinking to adjust to the sun. Sensing the Major General’s pride, he attempted to feign excitement at the dreary vista emerging before him. Just a few hours prior, the sights and sounds of Dallas had nearly made him dizzy. Blonde women. Cadillacs. Gas stations and golden arches. Alas, Robinson had driven on as storefronts gave way to silos and highways dwindled into dirt roads. Wansup glanced mournfully at the pickup truck, knowing fully well he had nowhere to go. Not once had he questioned the Robinson’s remarkable proposal for Wansup to leave the war-torn outskirts of Seoul and join him on his sprawling ranch. But Wansup’s gunslinging fantasies evaporated at the sight of the tractor slumped in the half-plowed field and the lethargic mare grazing beside it. Still, he knew to be grateful. His old army general had not merely led him from one desolate hellscape to another. Paul Robinson offered opportunity and safety; it would be greedy to want adventure, too.
“A three-point drawbar,” Wansup recited. “It’s about a yard long, and it hooks up to the back of your trac –”
“I know what it is,” drawled the salesclerk. “We’re sold out here, but you can always head down to Valera.”
“Valera?”
The clerk glanced up from her tabloid, her eyes growing wide. She had never seen an Asian person before, much less one speaking better English than hers.
“It’s the nearest town, about 10 miles east,” she recovered. “It’s not much there, but the depot should have it.”
Wansup prayed she’d returned to her magazine as he mounted a horse for what was then the second time in his life. Robinson had demanded he return home right away, but surely a General should trust his Captain to hold his own? Robinson’s old, brown Stetson dipped over his eyes and his bare ankles knocked against the metal stirrups, but Wansup couldn’t help but smile. The sun was high, so he turned around and followed his shadow east.
He knew he could not outrun them. Wansup heard the charging hoofbeats and the riders’ cries crescendo to a deafening thunder, and his heart sank with the realization that the old mare didn’t stand a chance in escaping them. He’d seen enough Westerns to know what happened next: They circled, kicking up a swirling column of dust that closed in like a fortress. Wansup looked to the sky and longed desperately for home.
The dust cloud scattered. He heard a second gunshot, then a third, and gaped with bewilderment as the masked gang dispersed. A thin man in a white ten-gallon hat cantered toward him, his smoking revolver still pointed high. He holstered his weapon and pulled up next to Wansup, who remained still. His giant hat obscured his long, gaunt face, save for his pale eyes and large, radiant teeth.
“I thought you were Clint Eastwood,” Wansup said breathlessly.
“I wish,” the man laughed. He paused. “Not sure what to make of you.”
“My name is Wansup Shim. I’ve come from Korea.”
“I’m Tom.” The men shook hands.
“Are you the sheriff?” Wansup asked.
“No, I...” He stopped. “...No, but I like to keep an eye on things.”
Wansup didn’t reply.
“You’re a long way from home…”
“...Wansup,” he provided. “I also go by ‘David.’”
“David. From the Bible,” Tom smirked. “Any of y’all pray to Jesus back home?”
“The missionaries did okay,” said Wansup simply.
Tom chuckled. “You’re a funny one, David. Let’s get you sorted out.”
Wansup always wondered why the Major General kept him close around camp, letting Wansup eat in the officers’ mess hall and ride beside him in the Jeep. But as Tom aggressively haggled with the clerk at the depot, securing the tractor drawbar for an almost benevolent price, Wansup recognized the gratitude one could feel towards a translator.
“What do you say we get you a proper hat and boots?” Tom asked, flashing a bright smile.
“I don’t have enough money,” Wansup lamented.
“You can’t ride in that goofy hat and lawyer shoes,” Tom laughed, gesturing at Wansup’s polished Oxfords. “I’ll tell you what, Korean cowboy. These are on me.”
The clerk shot Wansup a hesitant look.
“Don’t be a racist pig,” Tom glowered at the shrinking employee. “Let’s show our friend David a nice Texas welcome.”
Wansup’s protests faltered at the sight of the crisp black hat and stiff brown boots. “I’ll pay you back later, I promise,” he insisted.
Tom’s pearly grin nearly reached his watery blue eyes. “I know you will.”
“I should really be getting back,” Wansup declared, suppressing a hiccup.
“Do you say that after every drink?” Tom teased, pouring more whiskey. Everyone in America regarded Wansup with curiosity, but only Tom cared enough to hear his story. He seemed fascinated by Wansup’s relationship with Robinson and had countless questions about the ranch.
“There’s really not much there,” Wansup maintained. “Your life seems far more exciting.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Tom mused. “Not much to show for this life on the road.”
Wansup thought of the ranch house, of Robinson asleep in the master bedroom, of moonlight traversing the dust-coated floors. He clicked his boots pensively on the barstool. “I’ll raise enough money to bring over my wife and children, and then I guess we’ll head someplace else. Maybe Dallas.”
“Families! What a pain,” Tom cried. “That’s why I don’t have one. And look at me, I go where I want, do what I want, and sleep where I want. Your Major General wouldn’t approve. But I’m not living for anybody else. This is all mine.”
Wansup considered Tom’s words. “I guess I’ll stay for another.”
“You’re going to be just fine,” Tom replied.
Wansup stumbled as he finally left the bar, but the stars helped him navigate with ease. As the big house appeared before him, illuminated under the night sky, he felt that Tom was completely right.

Quite reclined, legs crossed, sporting grey high tops and a navy blue DJ Bruce Lee t-shirt straight out of “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” Robert Downey Jr. sat facing Howard Stern. The world’s ears were perked. And yet, when Stern asked Iron Man if he was insulted that Martin Scorsese said his movies weren’t cinema, he said no.
A few weeks ago, Martin Scorsese sat down for an interview with Empire magazine in which he shat on Marvel. “I don’t see them. I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema,” he said. “Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”
Watching this video of Downey’s response, my inner seven-year-old squirmed, screaming deflection and betrayal. I audibly sighed and turned if off after two minutes. I had been expecting the witty one-liners of Tony Stark — “Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?”, for example — and instead received verbal excerpts straight out of a news article. Less Iron Man, more Peter Parker. Perhaps even Kellyanne Conway.
A more sophisticated commentator might accuse me of being closed-minded for denigrating Downey’s insistence on moderation and the necessity of a broad spectrum of artistic opinions. I would point that individual to a few personal facts about Mr. Downey. First, RDJ has spent over a decade playing Iron Man. Second, Mr. Downey has attracted millions of fans for that role (my seven-year-old self included). And third, Downey has been handsomely rewarded for his time with Marvel, rebooting his career after rehab and scoring over $75 million dollars for “Avengers: Endgame” alone. Downey’s neglect to defend a franchise he has so thoroughly invested in and benefited from borders on cognitive dissonance. His fans deserved and deserve a bit more than his eloquence.
Far from the witty resolution of the unofficial leader of the Avengers, Robert Downey Jr’s lackluster defense of the Marvel Cinematic Universe demonstrated the circuitous evasion of a CNN interview. Scorsese, undoubtedly a great filmmaker, said that Marvel isn’t cinema and compared it to a theme park. The real Iron Man would have taken him to school, and maybe to Disney World. At this rate, I don’t know if Downey deserves an AI comeback. I, for one, would not mind if Shuri takes his place.

For readers longing for a book that resembles “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” but is also infused with gothic horror, look no further than Jane Cockram’s debut novel, “The House of Brides,” which is filled with a hearty helping of great houses fallen into ruin, shadowy figures lurking in hallways, and buried scandals that entangle generations of wealthy female socialites. “The House of Brides” follows Miranda Courtenay, a social media influencer specializing in healthy lifestyle content who has recently fallen out of favor with her followers. In the midst of public scrutiny and familial disappointment, Miranda receives a mysterious letter pleading for help from her long-dead mother, the renowned Tessa Summer, who penned a book titled “The House of Brides” about the history of eccentric summer women who dwelled at Barnsley House, her own family’s longstanding English estate, over the decades. The return address on the letter? The same estate that Miranda’s mother had brought to life in her writing. Throughout the tale of Miranda’s impromptu investigation into Barnsley disguised as a nanny seeking work, Cockram concocts captivating descriptions that color her writing with impressive eeriness. Even though her eye for detail and her ear for tone are to be lauded, Cockram’s presentation of the plot leaves much to be desired, from her excessive reliance on a character’s journal entries to drive the story forward to her persistent attempts to bring “hip” social media references into the narrative.
Cockram’s writing style is loaded with gems of detail that capture the subtler facets of horror, effortlessly achieving the atmosphere of paranoia that is highly coveted within the mystery and suspense genres. As she seamlessly alternates between descriptions of the setting and character, Cockram establishes psychological depth and thematic cohesiveness with passages such as the one where Miranda first meets her uncle Max Summer, the current proprietor of Barnsley: “I knew now that the lush grass of the pictures was invaded by winter weeds, and I was expecting the human equivalent. A man in his prime, cut down by the insidious creep of life.” Even when Cockram veers towards less original imagery to invoke suspense, such as motifs of solitude or darkness, her elegant phrasing saves the familiar language from seeming too derivative or cartoonish: “I carried no torch, and it took some time for my eyes to adjust, the branches intertwining overhead to create a tunnel of darkness through which I ventured slowly.”
Despite Cockram’s general success in terms of her carefully nuanced writing, her stylistic choices are occasionally so oddly dissonant with her previously established voice that it jerks the reader out of the story. At the end of certain paragraphs, like the one in which Miranda offhandedly comments on how many bananas she used to eat, Cockram tacks on hashtags like “#potassium #hearhear #wellness” as if she suddenly started writing an Instagram caption rather than a novel. These baffling hashtags add nothing to the narrative, except to serve as a tacky reminder that Miranda used to be a social media influencer. In fact, they detract from the novel’s thematic integrity by casting the protagonist in a laughably childish light and dissipating much of the tension that Cockram has otherwise been working so hard to build.
Continuing on the topic of references to social media, Cockram relentlessly attempts to inject modernity and Internet-savviness into “The House of Brides” to the point that it comes off as awkward and disingenuous. For instance, in a suspenseful scene where Miranda is confronting a character who was heavily foreshadowed as an antagonist, Cockram interjects that Miranda “had to draw on all the inspirational memes [she] had ever reposted to move [her] legs one after the other and follow Mrs. Mins up the hill.” At first, the mentions of social media seemed to be building towards a moral of how cultivating an online façade of perfection isn’t worth forgoing meaningful, real-life experiences. However, Cockram never tries to qualify or flesh out this notion, and simply shoehorns this same warning against technology into the plot at regular intervals like a nagging mother.
Another downfall of “The House of Brides” is Cockram’s heavy reliance on inserting notes, article clippings, and journal entries into the text to convey crucial plot details. The main consequence of dedicating a substantial portion of the total page count to journal entries written by Daphne Summer, the newest bride of Barnsley House, is that Miranda’s role in the novel is relegated to seeking out opportunities to read this diary. Because Cockram doesn’t give much chance for Miranda to be a proactive protagonist, “The House of Brides” puts most of its action in flashbacks, which unfortunately only jumbles the narrative flow and minimizes the significance of present events in the plot. Given the clumsy presentation of the plot, it’s not much of a surprise that the conclusion to “The House of Brides” is similarly disappointing. Although Cockram continuously implies that Miranda’s life is in danger at Barnsley and that dark secrets lurk in her family history, the final plot twist is nowhere near as thrilling as advertised.
Final verdict? A craving for familiar drama would better be fixed by watching reruns of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” — after all, Kim’s petty feuds with her sisters might just be grittier than the entire plot of “The House of Brides.”

As the 2010s come to a close, the "Decade in Review" series will seek to unravel the best 10 best films from the 10 biggest genres of the decade. Now that every notable wide release science fiction film has been released, science fiction will serve as the first entry in the 10-part series. From $300 million budget box office behemoths to meticulously constructed auteur masterpieces, science fiction has certainly provided some of the widest ranges of films to pick from. Note that this particular ranking does not include superhero films, which often overlap with science fiction, since they have grown into a genre in and of themselves.
10. "The Martian" (2015), Dir. Ridley Scott
Scott's "The Martian" is a surprisingly comedic science fiction film, especially considering it's by a director who revolutionized the genre with groundbreaking pictures "Alien" (1979) and "Blade Runner" (1982). When botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is trapped on Mars when his crew mistakenly leaves him behind in a dust storm, he needs to find a way to keep himself alive and find a way back home. With its quippy, dialogue-driven script, "The Martian" breezes through its 141 minute runtime and lands comfortably at the number 10 spot.
9. "Gravity" (2013), Dir. Alfonso Cuarón
Every frame of “Gravity” conveys the most realistic depiction of space committed to film. Cuarón transforms "Gravity" into an unforgettably ethereal adventure with groundbreaking visual effects and gorgeous cinematography that immerses the audience in the hostile vacuum of space. Adding Sandra Bullock’s commanding lead performance to the mix leaves one with a powerful experience, even if it lacks the narrative heft of Cuarón's other films.
8. "Ad Astra" (2019), Dir. James Gray
Gray's introspective "Ad Astra" is a powerful meditation of loneliness that ranks amongst the finest science fiction think pieces in recent years. It ticks all the boxes: a haunting score from Max Richter, a superb leading performance by Brad Pitt, and stunning cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema. One might argue that "Ad Astra" is hindered by mild tonal mismatches and occasionally glacial pacing, but these choices are ultimately justified by the film's poignant — if slightly overstated — conclusion.
7. "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" (2014), Dir. Matt Reeves
A sprawling epic that merges cutting edge technology with thematic gravitas, the "Planet of the Apes" reboot trilogy is one of the most consistent science fiction trilogies of all time. With Andy Serkis arguably giving a career-best motion capture performance as Caesar, an ape who is the embodiment of a character that transcends the technology it's rooted in: It's fascinating how much humanity Serkis can express using predominantly his eyes and body language. Any film of the trilogy could have found its place on this list, but "Dawn" feels like a more mature, more political evolution of "Rise," while avoiding the protracted conclusion of "War": It's fast-paced, Shakespearean, and thoroughly immersive.
6. "Looper" (2012), Dir. Rian Johnson
Johnson exploded onto the science fiction scene with "Looper," his first big-budget film. In the near future, when time travel is possible (but instantly outlawed), criminal organizations send their enemies back in time to be disposed by contracted assassins called "loopers." Starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a looper sent back in time to kill himself and "close his loop," "Looper" combines mind-warping time-travel logic with surprisingly hopeful themes of change and tolerance.
5. "Her" (2013), Dir. Spike Jonze
Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors of his generation. From the physicality he brings in "Joker," to the cunning he embodies in "Gladiator," Phoenix is a magnetic screen presence in whatever film he is in. Jonze guides Phoenix into one of his most subtle performances in "Her" as an introverted man in the near future who falls in love with his virtual assistant (Scarlett Johansson). "Her" is so poignant because it never feels too dystopian; it's understated, natural, and feels like a natural progression of today's society.
4. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" (2015), Dir. J.J. Abrams
A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, "Star Wars" seemed destined to have concluded its legendary theatrical run when George Lucas' prequel trilogy bowed out of cinemas in 2005. But after Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, it did so with hopes of producing another sequel trilogy, and while the latest installment, "The Last Jedi," has certainly been divisive, most can agree that "The Force Awakens" marked a promising re-launch of the storied saga. While it blatantly panders to fans with a plot ripped directly from "A New Hope," "The Force Awakens" sets up interesting new characters and worldbuilding that sparked excitement upon its release. Complete with gorgeous cinematography and a return from legendary composer John Williams, "The Force Awakens" does its job in reinvigorating nostalgic fans and converting new ones.
3. "Arrival" (2016), Dir. Denis Villeneuve
Villeneuve tells an innovative nonlinear story of tolerance and understanding through first contact, all while rooting "Arrival" in a riveting personal journey through grief, loss, and acceptance, through a standout, masterful performance by Amy Adams. The first-contact part of the story is unflinchingly realistic, uncannily timely (given today's political climate), and leaves one thinking for days. When Villeneuve begins to weave these two central plot threads together (and he does so seamlessly), "Arrival" transcends both of its stories to remarkably beautiful — and shocking — effect.
2. "Inception" (2010), Dir. Christopher Nolan
With a layered plot that weaves between multiple levels of dreams, and an ensemble of A-list actors all vying for screen-time (Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy to name a few), "Inception" somehow manages to still tell a tightly plotted, effective story. It's a reminder that blockbusters can be successful without underestimating the audience: "Inception" is an interactive experience that requires as much of viewers as the best think pieces in the genre, and does so in gloriously high-budget fashion.
1. "Blade Runner: 2049" (2017), Dir. Denis Villeneuve
Denis Villeneuve is the only returning director on this list, and it's not without good reason. Arguably just as thought-provoking, thematically profound, and visually splendid as Ridley Scott's noir masterpiece "Blade Runner," Denis Villeneuve's highly awaited follow-up is a meditation on what it means to be human. Set 30 years after its predecessor, "Blade Runner: 2049" is content with telling its own story, not relying too heavily on the original, and it's all the better for it. Featuring some of the finest cinematography of all time, and earning Roger Deakins his well-deserved first Academy Award after 14 nominations, every frame of "Blade Runner: 2049" is a work of art. From the brown, depersonalizing hues of Tyrell Corporation to the vibrant neon of Los Angeles, Deakins' work here will inspire a new generation of filmmakers. Simply put, "Blade Runner: 2049" is perfectly cast (with Ryan Gosling as the stoic Officer K and Harrison Ford returning as Rick Deckard), impeccably shot, and is a natural thematic progression from Scott's science fiction classic; in other words, it is a well-deserved number one pick.

Ali Wong made her name as a standup comic by mooning the crowd as part of her set — she makes sure to tell you that multiple times throughout her essay collection “Dear Girls,” and for anyone who’s seen her Netflix specials, this isn’t that hard to believe. What is hard to believe, however, is that her series of reflections and life tips is somehow even raunchier than either “Hard Knock Wife” and “Baby Cobra,” though this isn’t necessarily a criticism. Actually, it makes each essay even funnier, because anyone familiar with Wong’s particular brand of comedy is bound to read every single word in her voice.
The structure is simple: Each essay starts with the titular words “Dear girls,” as they’re directed to her daughters’ teenage selves, before embarking on the roller coaster that is Wong’s train of thought. She manages to go everywhere before wrapping it up neatly at the end, even though she prefaces the first essay by saying that writing is hard and that she doesn’t like it very much — hence the afterword from Justin Hakuta, her husband, shaman, and ramen expert, that Wong says takes up space in the book so that she can write less. Writing is hard, and she may not like it very much, but Wong is good at it. After all, it’s particularly rare to encounter an author who writes like they speak in real life.
Complaining about why Longchamp Le Pliage bags cost so much could very well be a part of her set: As Wong correctly points out, they are quite literally two pieces of nylon sewn together with a waterproof lining that turns nasty after a decent amount of wear. So could the logical reasons underpinning the clear necessity of taking off one’s shoes before entering one’s house. And, of course, so could her particular aversion to having sex with virgins after having reached a certain age. Basically anything relating to sex, which is a good 50 percent of the book, is easily stand-up material. For practical tips, see page 126 for how to choose a good Asian restaurant and page 171 on how to do a wedding right.
The meat of the collection — and the reason you’ll want to sit down and read instead of sit down and watch Netflix — is insightful and deeply touching, while maintaining the sarcastic voice that makes her instantly recognizable. Wong spends a few pages discussing her miscarriage to normalize what happens to many women, both to and without their knowledge, and to dispel the myth that women are somehow to blame for the miscarriage they obviously did not want. She hates the question, “What is it like to be an Asian woman in comedy?” because she finds it reductive, and would rather spend her time telling budding comedians how she got over her fear of having a joke flop. PSA: There aren’t more women in comedy because of safety issues, even minute ones, that men, no matter how well-meaning, have never had to think about.
“Snake Heart,” her essay on the necessities of studying abroad, is far and away her best, although all of them are pure entertainment that still make readers think. This essay is far more than the typical “study abroad to change yourself” slogan that appears in college brochures and website copy. Rather, Wong writes about the time she ate fertilized duck embryo to show that wimping out over something “gross” that exists outside our culture is not something she’ll tolerate. And she’s right: Sure, you might study abroad to meet cute guys, but if that’s the only reason, you’re doing it wrong. Sit down, and eat the embryo.
That Wong can take other clichés like the term “first world problems” and deal with them in a way that is refreshingly new is telling. For many women, the phrase “running in the dark was scarier than being fat” when describing her dilemma while studying in Vietnam hits home in many different ways, each inducing a slight wince. Wong mentions “trapping” her husband many, many times, but still tugs at heartstrings when she says that the most important part of a relationship is simply being there for the other person.
And, of course, she skewers men who struggle with the earning potential of their wives, noting that “a true feminist husband doesn’t see a woman’s money, power, and/or respect as a reflection of his own lack of success.” Her comedy career wouldn’t exist without her husband helping her both behind the scenes and by her side — a rarity, she implies, in a world when some progressive men still envision parenting as something they can do casually on the weekends, as though becoming a more-than-part-time parent, or even stay-at-home father, would be a last resort. Wong tells it straight: Women are expected to give things up for others — and be okay with it.
Because the collection is directed as a series of lessons to her daughters, there are fewer details of Wong’s backstory about how she made it in the comedy world, and more about her connections to China and Vietnam, and the complicated way that played out in her relationships with her parents. Yet that’s fine: As readers, we’re lucky to have this wildly funny peek into the way Wong really thinks. She may dislike writing, and it may be a long time before she puts pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) again, but damn — the wait will be a hard one.

David Krakauer is a Grammy-nominated clarinetist who performs jazz, classical, and klezmer music. In 2015, Krakauer received a Grammy nomination as a soloist with the self-conducted chamber orchestra “A Far Cry,” and a Juno nomination for the CD “Akoka.” In November, Krakauer is set to perform with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. The program includes the Boston premiere of Mathew Rosenblum’s clarinet concerto “Lament/Witches’ Sabbath” and Wlad Marhulets’s “Concerto for Klezmer Clarinet.” The Harvard Crimson spoke with Krakauer about his music background and upcoming concert program.
The Harvard Crimson: Tell us about your background. What drew you to music?
David Krakauer: It’s a long story. I started playing when I was 10 years old in elementary school. My late mother was a violinist. She said to me, “Oh, you’re way too old to play the violin. So you should play a wind instrument.” And that’s how I got started on the clarinet.
As a teenager, I was playing both jazz and classical music. But when I was in my early 20s, I kind of had a crisis of confidence about jazz. I sort of thought I would never find my own voice and that I would never be able to be original. So I decided to focus on classical music. Throughout my 20s I was doing a lot of chamber music. And then in my early 30s, again, I had this kind of crisis when I was thinking, “wow, I really want to improvise, I want to get back to that side of me.” I felt like I had thrown the baby out with the bathwater.
Slowly, I began to get into the music of my cultural heritage, Eastern European Jewish klezmer. At first I started playing very small bands in very modest situations, just to learn the style. It was an interesting time because there was a kind of a second revival of klezmer brewing. The Berlin Wall was about to fall. This was the time of Gorbachev and Perestroika. People were reading “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” and novels like that from Czechoslovakia. All of this cultural stuff was kind of coming out of Eastern Europe in the late ‘80s, and this was kind of creating the soil for a second klezmer revival. I didn’t know that at the time. I was just looking to play some music, but I did have this urge to follow the social and cultural currents. That drew me towards klezmer music.
THC: What does making music mean for you? What do you hope to convey to your audience?
DK: When people come to hear my concerts, a word they use a lot is generosity. They say, “Thank you for your generosity.” I think that it’s very important to come on stage and not just play a lot of pretty notes, but to convey emotions and to make people feel things and make people think. The beauty of music is that it’s a great opportunity to share those sorts of things. It’s not just to make people happy. Sometimes there are songs that are very sad, but you get a whole room full of people really feeling together. It’s a great honor really, for me, to be able to have a platform and play my music and inspire people.
THC: Tell us more about the two works you’ll be performing in the Boston concert. What can concertgoers expect from your upcoming shows?
DK: I’ll be playing two different clarinet concerti. These are two pieces of music that I’m very closely connected to. One piece I’m doing [“Lament/Witches’ Sabbath”] is by the composer Matthew Rosenblum, and we recorded this piece together. It’s an extremely personal piece for Matthew. One time I met him he said, “You know, I have this idea. I want to write something.” He was talking about his grandmother who would sing, who would tell the story of her flight [as] a girl. Her town was being burned down, and all the people were being killed in the town because there was a lot of anti-Semitism back in the early 20th century. His grandmother would tell him the story of kind of half speaking, half singing, kind of crying through the whole thing. So he was haunted by this idea of his grandmother telling the story. After we had recorded it, I sat back and listened to the piece without being an active participant. I was like, “This actually sounds like fear itself.” The piece really is a crazy scream.
The other concerto that I’m performing [“Concerto for Klezmer Clarinet”] has a crazy story to it too. Back about 11 or 12 years ago, I got an email from a young man with Jewish roots living in Poland. He wanted to write some music for me. I heard a demo of his music and I said, “Wow, this is incredible. You should definitely do that.” And so I said, “Why don’t you write a clarinet Concerto for me?” I played the piece with various orchestras in Europe. I’m really excited to play it in Boston. This will be a very important American performance of the work.
THC: Any last words of wisdom you’d share with young and aspiring musicians?
DK: I would say for any musicians: follow your dreams, follow your heart, and do what you want to do. But be clever about it. It’s a very hard profession. It’s hard to make a living. Try to seek out every opportunity and use your potential to the fullest. I feel like it’s important to be a musician, but it’s also very important to be a human being.
Krakauer is playing at New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall on Nov. 23, 2019.

Amidst 14 stationary works of art in the heart of Hapgood Wright Town Forest in Concord, Mass., artists Karen Krolak and Nicole Harris exhibited an immersive joint performance piece with their works, titled “Relaying [78]’s” and “Love Letters from Boston” respectively. For two months, the Umbrella Arts Center’s fifth annual Art Ramble brings interactive art pieces into the forest, all centered around this year’s theme: witness.
Jess Muise, Umbrella Arts Center’s Visual Arts Director, gave her description of the Art Ramble amidst the project itself, as she walked among the trees and natural sounds of the forest. The Art Ramble is organized by Umbrella Arts Center’s arts and environment program, which according to Muise, is meant to connect people with nature through art.
“We’re actually walking on the Emerson Thoreau Amble, which is this path that they were known to walk between their houses. And so that’s part of the inspiration for the name ‘Art Ramble,’” Muise said.
Muise discussed the different contexts of the word witness, ranging from the judicial to religious sense, and finally connecting them to the witness of grief and loss. That theme — witnessing grief and loss — was the subject of the active performance piece offered on Oct. 10 with Monkeyhouse founders Krolak and Harris.
The Monkeyhouse website describes the organization as “an award winning, Boston based nonprofit that connects communities through choreography.”
In “Relaying [78]’s,” immediately after entering the forest and walking past the first Art Ramble pieces, a living woman stood holding a giant crocheted umbrella with streams of yarn hanging down around her like a giant jellyfish. This woman was Krolak, the piece’s creator.
The co-creator of the umbrella and cofounder of Monkeyhouse, Nicole Harris, had another project on the scene called “Love Letters from Boston” that she describes on her website as “the choreography of correspondence.” 
“It’s a way to remember that there’s always something good even on days that feel overwhelmed with negativity,” Harris wrote in an email of her work.
Harris explained that this event was an effort to intertwine the “Relaying [78]’s umbrella with her love letters. Krolak crafted the crocheted umbrella for “Relaying [78]’s” alongside Harris when Krolak was an artist in residence at the Newton Cemetery and Arboretum. The cemetery was then repairing a fence that was surrounded by willow trees, leading to the inspiration of the jellyfish-like tendrils that surrounded her.
“It gave me the idea to create this [umbrella] as a way, at first, just to be able to get people to be able to follow me on the guided tours I was doing,” she explained.
At the same time, Krolak had been working on a project called The Dictionary of Negative Space — a dictionary composed of previously undefinable concepts that Krolak aims to explain through the idea of negative space. Krolak organizes these wordless definitions by number: The term [78] actually refers to the definition of “ [78],” which is defined in her dictionary as “a being who does not make the grade to public memory after death.”
The inspiration for the dictionary came from the loss of Krolak’s mother, father, and brother in a car accident in 2012 that left her feeling as though she didn’t have the words to articulate her emotions.
“I found myself struggling to be able to explain to people what was happening in my head in, in my world, in my life,” Krolak explained. “I had thought that if I could just find thirty words … I could make sense and talk to people again.”
Krolak explained that through this difficult process of grief, there was no language for loss, and that this understanding allowed her to understand the power of wordlessness.
For the performance, Krolak wore her mother’s shoes.
“[My mother] was always talking about having to walk in other people’s shoes,” Krolak said. “And to think about the idea of walking in her shoes being a way that kind of keeps some aspect of her presence in my life here within a process like this [art performance] ... I think that she would understand the public good that comes out of it and the way in which that kind of feels like something she would be doing — to take care of an entire community.”
Krolak invites people wherever she brings the umbrella to place tags on the strands hanging from the umbrella, tags with the names of [78]’s that people want to be remembered. But Krolak said that although the project’s definition of a [78] focuses mainly on the memory of people lost, there are other losses that are just important.
“One of my favorite [tags] just said ‘Elroy the cat,’” she said.
Krolak and Harris encouraged the audience at the performance event to write a “love letter” to a [78] after placing a tag for that person on Krolak’s umbrella.
Krolak also explained that during one of her tours, her husband wanted to carry the umbrella for her because he thought it was too heavy for her to carry for the whole tour all by herself.
“I realized, as a metaphor, that’s a really beautiful thing, to be able to pass that process of holding onto all of that [loss] to somebody else… and by the end of the tour, every single person on the tour had carried it at some point in time,” Krolak said.
After this realization, Krolak began taking the umbrella to the many places she visits, to replicate this act of passing on the weight of loss to others.
“They were dancing with it and taking pictures,” Krolak said of the first time that she passed around the umbrella. “Instead of it feeling like something that’s this heavy burden, it was something that made them feel special and joyous.”

Drawing together works from its extensive collection and private loans, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston again seeks to bring about a unique outlook on contemporary art through its new exhibition, “Contemporary Art: Five Propositions.”
The exhibition, which opened Oct. 26, splits the collection of pieces into five thematic groupings: Color Fields, Imaginary Beings, Sculpture, Material, and Utopias. In efforts to both showcase and rethink the MFA’s contemporary art collection, the exhibition draws upon work from 1899 to 2019, and incorporates artists from around the world. While the exhibition draws from a diverse range of sources, media, and perspectives, the MFA’s website states that “the installation pinpoints certain strengths — and, in doing so, sometimes reveals the blind spots.”
Color Fields, the first space in the exhibition, greets visitors with large hanging tapestries painted with swathes of color when they enter through the glass double-doors of the gallery. The works dominate the entrance, and captured the attention of Jon Feng, a patron of the museum who, upon entering the space, said he was “very excited about the ones hanging on the ceiling.”
The room features a collection of works, ranging from a piece by early 20th century abstract artist Helen Frankenthaler to one of Andy Warhol’s Oxidation Paintings. “Color catalyzes human emotion” is written on the gallery wall, and the works in the first grouping incorporate media such as painting, photography, and installation to capture the effects of color.
Color Fields ends with a large, paneled installation piece from artist Lucy Dodd titled “lé,” which separates the first space and the second grouping, Imaginary Beings. Jaelen R. McCarthy, another visitor, emphasized the importance of the transition from one grouping to the next.
“I liked how that boxed it off and then it opens up to a bigger space,” McCarthy said.
The next grouping, Imaginary Beings, brings together works focusing on what it means to be human through realistic and fictional portrayals of figures. From paintings like “Grey Cat with Madrone and Birch Trees” by Joan Brown to a multimedia work that incorporates a glass taxidermy eye, the grouping is united through discussion of human form, rather than common medium.
The third collection, Sculpture, begins with Simone Leigh’s “No Face (Pannier),” a terracotta and steel sculpture of a faceless woman in a large raffia skirt that stands between the two groupings, confronting viewers as they move through. This grouping especially draws on an international range of work, from British Rachel Whiteread’s “Double - Doors II (A + B)” to Japanese-American artist Isamu Noguchi’s collection of smaller sculptures to the West-African inspired work of Simone Leigh.
The inclusion of international pieces caught the attention of many patrons, including Kashima Yukie, a visitor from Japan.
“I didn’t know this museum had such a large collection from worldwide sources,” Yukie said.
Material, the fourth grouping, occupies the same large room as Sculpture and brings together artists who explore and defy the “conventions and stereotypes between materials and identity,” according to the text on the gallery’s wall.
The grouping features pieces such as “The Kiss,” a single-channel black and white video on Laser Disc by Raphael Montañez Ortiz and “Wing” by Lynda Benglis, a raised cast-aluminum piece that juts out into the space.
Utopias, the final grouping in the sequence, features only three works: Dan Flavin’s fluorescent light piece “Monument for V. Tatlin,” one of Isa Genzken’s concrete sculptures, and Peter Fischli and David Weiss’s photograph “Ehre, Mut und Zuversicht.” The pieces occupy the smallest room of the groupings, and act as a conclusion to the exhibition.
Patrons of the museum complimented the exhibition’s scope and diversity.
“It’s better than I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be a couple pieces or so, but it looks like a really good show,” Feng said.
The exhibition draws from both its own collection and the loans from private parties, integrating lesser known works with staples of the Museum’s collection.
“My first impression is that I’m looking at a lot of work that I’ve never seen before, artists that I’ve never heard before,” said Peter Menendez, another patron of the museum.
The exhibition will run until May 4, 2020.

Stephen King is credited to have written 60 novels, five nonfiction works, and at least 10 collections of short. Out of his works, there are at least 50 film adaptations either already produced or currently in production. Some of King’s novels have even been adapted more than once, like the 2017 version of “It,” which succeeded the 1990 miniseries of the same name. There have also been at least 28 TV adaptations and spinoffs inspired by his work. There was even a musical in 1988 based on his novel “Carrie.” King continues to release new material with no sign of stopping anytime soon, and whenever a new work is released, the movie or TV rights are quickly purchased. How have so many of one author’s works have been adapted to the big screen? And why King?
The simple and most obvious answer is this: There’s just so much material for filmmakers to choose from. It’s a lot easier to develop a story from some already-established source material than starting from nothing. King has so much source material to choose from that screen adapters seemingly have an endless supply. For the majority of authors, the feat of completing upwards of 50 books is rarely accomplished, and for an author who’s written, say, five works, it would be impossible to create so many adaptations from such a small pool of sources.
The success of King’s novels and the subsequent film and TV adaptations entices directors looking for their own success. Producing work derived from the so-called “king of horror” is a safe bet for filmmakers looking to make a name for themselves. If the stories that King creates come with their own built-in fanbase that he has garnered over the years, these fans are bound to generate a certain amount of box office sales.
The stories that King creates are unique, but a proliferation of work doesn’t necessarily mean each story is new and original. King isn’t the only author to have written such a large quantity of works — some mystery or romance genre writers have just as many (think Agatha Christie). However, authors with the same voluminous bibliography often write stories that are shockingly similar and formulaic to one another. His novels range from being rooted in reality to having slight supernatural undertones to being incredibly complex universes separate from this one. This diversity gives filmmakers the opportunity to choose from many topics and put their own spin on one of them.
The success of the recent “It” films will undoubtedly usher in an influx of even more filmmakers adapting King’s novels to ride on the popularity and spotlight that the two “It” films have brought back to King’s stories. The popular TV show “Castlerock” — based on an amalgamation of many of King’s ideas derived from numerous novels — just released the first few episodes of its second season on Hulu, creating even more buzz and dialogue around King’s name. The movie adaptation of “Doctor Sleep,” based off the novel of the same name, is set to come out on Nov. 8. This story is the sequel to King’s novel “The Shining,” and the critically acclaimed movie adaptation of the same name, released in 1980 produced by the iconic director Kubrick. Kubrick, who’s been cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history, produced and directed the second ever adaptation of a King novel. “The Shining” is regarded as one of the classic staples in cinematic horror and potentially the impetus for the recognition of King's works have received from filmmakers everywhere. These adaptations of King’s novels have become increasingly popular, so it’s in filmmakers’ best interest to keep creating them.
The other draw of King’s novels is that adhering to his opinion and staying true to the source material are more or less unnecessary. King actually hated the movie version of his novel “The Shining,” believing that Kubrick didn’t look at the screenplay that King had written for the movie, instead of opting to make his own decisions on the film. The film itself still remains one of the most popular and acclaimed movies of all time and is considered as a masterpiece in horror even despite King’s disdain for the film. Even though these novels come with a dedicated fan base, a good deal of artistic license enables filmmakers to reimagine King’s stories — captivating new audiences as well as old fans. King writes so many stories that eventually become films or television specials that he cannot control much of the artististry of these adaptations, leaving those liberties to the filmmakers.
King’s most recent novel, “The Institute,” was released on Sep. 10, and by Sep. 11 the rights had already been reserved for a TV adaptation of the novel. King’s stories are in such high esteem in this new age of adaptations and reboots that in less than 24 hours rights to his newest novel had already been snatched up by Jack Bender, director of iconic television series such as “Lost” and “Game of Thrones.”
There is no stopping these adaptations from continuing — as long as King continues writing, filmmakers will continue to create adaptations. Whether or not these adaptations should be created is besides the point because, in the end, they work. They continue to bring in revenue for film and TV creators, and they attract new audiences to the directors, screenwriters, and actors involved in the production.

As people filed into the First Floor Annex of the Sackler Building last Friday, many attendees ended up sitting cross-legged on the floor alongside the already-filled rows of seats. The crowds were there to hear six famous architects — Hilary Sample and Michael Meredith of Office MOS, Kersten Geers of Office KGDVS, Éric Lapierre from ÉLEX, and Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee of Johnston Marklee — and a discussion on the works that influenced their lives. Throughout the conversation, the architects touched on topics ranging from European modernity, to the concept of form, to generational divides among architects.
The conversation took place as the fifth installment of Five on Five, a lunch talk series presenting architects of contrasting backgrounds and experiences to speak on projects that have been relevant to their career.
“I’ve been to previous ones [lectures], and they’ve all been really interesting discussions," Paul Wood, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said. “Particularly this one, there were some pretty famous architects that we hear talked about a lot. We cite their projects and stuff, so it's exciting to be at a table with all of them thinking together.”
Against a backdrop of buildings and blueprints projected onto a screen behind them, the table of six engaged in a back-and-forth mixed with commentary on architectural projects, both personal and not.
Early on, Lapierre spoke on the Eames House, a monument of mid-20th century modern architecture, designed, built, and inhabited by Charles and Ray Eames. Lapierre contrasted this work with traditionally modernist European works, highlighting its lightness and unimposing nature.
“It shows the ways in which architecture, which used to be so heavy, turned cool,” Lapierre said.
Johnston and Marklee then provided their commentary on the Radio Television Suisse (RTS) by Office KGDVS, a project of which Geers is a founder. Johnston said the RTS media complex is unique in its spatial invention — the ability for the complex to have diverse spaces for a variety of functions.
“In a way, it kind of approximates a kind of big city within the footprint of one building,” Johnston said.
Geers agreed that such elements of separation and sectioning were drivers for Office KGDVS’s particular design, expressing interest in their connection.
“There’s this moment where structure and space and exterior and interior and the box and the negotiation of the box, so how the box fits on the side and how it doesn’t fit on the side, meet — all these themes somehow come together,” Geers said.
The panelists also discussed the varied meanings of form. Geers conceptualizes form through box-like structures in his RTS. To Geers, the box is a marker of a object-territory dichotomy, which serves to enhance the meaning of the box-like form through reference to what it is not.
Johnston commented on the appeal of a kind of form signified by the very lack of form.
“There’s a way of making form without being formalist,” she said.
Meredith said he appreciated this distinction between form and formalism, as many of Office MOS’s works center around a lack of imposing form and openness.
“It’s like cool form, as opposed to hot form. You’re not trying to resolve it all into a synthetic whole, but you’re kind of just allowing all the piece to express itself as a collection of parts — not as a gesture but as an assemblage,” he said.
The event took on a host of issues within the field of architecture and GSD students Proey Liao and Adrien Wong said they felt it was engaging.
“Seeing the professors and of backgrounds that meet here and talk about architecture in an informal way is pretty interesting,” Wong said.
Liao highlighted the exciting chaos of the discussion. “What most resonated with me was the terminology — the way words are thrown around, reinterpreted, misinterpreted, discussed,” Liao said.

Amidst unearthly destruction, Rockman’s vividly colored works convey an electric sense of life. From the evolution of humankind to the extinction of its most precious creatures, Rockman’s nature-centric paintings employ a Romanticism, if not also a Dali-esque surrealism, in their allusion to ecological tragedy and loss amidst the existential threat of climate change. In a New York Times piece last year, Rockman was listed among 12 artists focusing on climate change. He described his projects not only as a means of coping with the climate crisis but of spurring the public to action. “I believed that if one could render moments of extinction, genocide, population explosion and political discord visible, then we might learn to confront and change the conditions leading to civilization’s collapse,” he said in the article.
This urge to awaken public consciousness is not unique to Rockman. Increasingly, artists are cutting across mediums to disrupt artistic convention; it is not only the visceral imagery, but also the symbolic weight of their work that captures viewers’ attention, forcing them to face the climate emergency. Increasingly, artists are using their work to recultivate a sense of curiosity and wonder in the natural world, while also using themes of endangerment and extinction to convey the unparalleled threat posed by humans to this world's existence.
While Rockman’s surrealist paintings cultivate a sense of wanderlust through bright colors and bold strokes, glaciogenic artist Jill Pelto blurs the lines between science and art to translate her experiences in nature into watercolor portraits of the life she seeks to preserve. She defies the stereotypical view of scientists and experts being removed from the picture of public communication about the climate crisis. In fact, such communication is the essence of Pelto’s work: Her “love of nature drives [her] to creatively communicate information about environmental issues with a broad audience,” as nature itself represents a “work of art.” The faint lines and soft colors she employs invoke the ultimate fragility of nature, even as she depicts its power in the form of polar ice caps, mountain ridges, and raging fires. None of her wildlife is truly still; even in pure landscapes, the texture of Pelto’s work creates a sense of movement. In an almost metacognitive study of her and humans’ position in the natural world, Pelto also depicts herself trekking through nature. Such works transcend the divide between the experiential and the visual, rendering her work more accessible and even familiar to other lovers of nature. Pelto paints to save and transform the world that inspired her to create in the first place.
In the era of the climate emergency, art is also taking on a more explicitly activist tone. Teenage artist Kallan Benson’s massive monarch butterfly parachute represents a participatory act of resistance. It actively constitutes and supports protest. Now, the “Parachutes for the Planet” project by the Mother Earth Project encourages activists to create parachutes like Benson’s to call for climate action, drawing inspiration from a quilt exhibition that raised awareness about the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1990s. Another protest-oriented representation of the need for environmental action can be found in a seven meter-long boat constructed from only recycled plastic by the Flipflopi Project. The actual utility of the boat, which sailed around the Indian Ocean coastline, elevates its call for a “plastic revolution.” Quite literally, this distinct form of art spreads awareness of the magnitude of ocean pollution by plastic waste and makes a statement about the urgent need for climate action and eco-conscious consumerism.
Climate artists are also employing social media to amplify their works’ messages. Through art Instagram and Twitter accounts, they integrate climate consciousness into the digital sphere, making it part of users’ and largely, young people’s daily content. On her “GlaciogenicArt” account, for instance, Pelto emphasizes her artistic mission by commenting directly on related developments of the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Mother Earth Project extends its reach to encouraging the creation of virtual parachutes specifically for social media.
As artists innovate new ways to express and disseminate the urgent need for climate action, they make a call for far more than spectatorship. Rockman and Pelto’s works are not meant to hang on museum walls or contribute to living room aesthetics; they are meant to infuse new color into what can seem like a dying world, given the stark reality of global climate change. These artists are using their chosen mediums as tools for movement-making. By illuminating the threats to the what people most value about the natural world — portraying the majesty and power of non-human life — they evoke a deep and perhaps somewhat involuntary emotional response. They implore their public audience to stop passively observing the crisis unfold, and instead become active agents in its resistance.
— Contributing writer Ilana Cohen’s '22 column, “Expressions of the Climate Emergency,” is a nonfiction column that discusses artistic response and resistance to the climate crisis.

Theater artist Kaneza Schaal has been hard at work transforming the avant-garde scene through her creative pieces that have been shown everywhere from Kigali, Rwanda, to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. At Harvard, she now teaches a Theater, Dance, and Media (TDM) master class called “Performing Death: Ancient Texts as Performance Score” and a semester-long course, “The New Social Practice: Creativity and Political Space.” She is also preparing for upcoming showings of her most recent work, “Triptych (Eyes of One Another),” which explores the formative impact of black-and-white portraitist Robert Mapplethorpe through a performative display of music and photography.
The Harvard Crimson: You graduated from Wesleyan and are based in New York. Can you tell me a bit about your early life growing up?
Kaneza Schaal: I grew up as a child in San Francisco in the ‘80s. And part of my attraction to this project “Triptych” is that I am always drawn to work that is in some way addressing the presence of the absent. My mother and I were living at my aunt's house, and there was a social group of 10 gay men around my aunt and her partner. And by the time I was six, eight of them had passed away because of AIDS. And so in this project, we are holding a lot of guilt. Some of those folks made it into archives, and many of those folks didn’t make it into archives. And so part of the work of this project is to hold the ghosts that everyone has put into the world.
THC: What are some of your biggest inspirations?
KS: I’m always interested in work that speaks many different languages: direct, aesthetic, and formal and artistic languages. And that’s also cultural and historical and experiential languages. I believe that if we make work that speaks many languages, it can speak to many different people. I do not believe that avant-garde performance practices are inherently for small, elite audiences and if we can make work that speaks different languages, it can reach many people.
THC: Going off of this theme of difference and universality, we know you are big on concepts of hybridity, radical borrowing, and diversity. How have those motivated your travels, and in turn, how have your travels affected these principles?
KS: I came up performing in a kind of European tour circuit. I’m particularly interested in my own practice in participating and promoting artistic exchange — so looking for ways to share work within the context of the global south. Artists of the global south are speaking to each other directly, rather than the traditional model in which that is mediated through a western platform. So I'm always looking and excited by the ways that ideas and stories and the world can move.
THC: You’ve worked on five major works so far: “GO FORTH,” “JACK &,” “CARTOGRAPHY,” “MAZE,” and “Triptych.” What has each work represented to you?
KS: In some ways, I think of myself as an essayist: Each of the pieces is me thinking of a question or an idea. “GO FORTH” was considering mourning rituals, and in a way my exploration of personal processing theater as personal processing. I was experiencing the death of my father at the time, so it was exploring how we make space for the absent. “JACK &” was a continuation of a conversation with an artist who I had already been working with, Cornell Alston, who served 33 years in the New York State prison system. In some ways that piece is my take on “community theater” and considers how we get out of the guilt-innocence dichotomy in which so much of our conversations in the US revolves around. And then with “CARTOGRAPHY,” I would say that piece is thinking about migration and mapping. It is also rooted in a personal place with my own family’s history as refugees and also that is me thinking about children’s theater. I'm always interested in how our cultural institutions can understand themselves as public spaces. And with “Triptych” I would say — “Triptych” is a complicated project. We have so many different artists that come to the piece with many different interests and admirations and questions on Mapplethorpe’s work. Sometimes they agree and our curiosities and desires overlap, and sometimes they diverge. And as director, some of my work is arranging this tapestry and seeing to it that it doesn’t tear.
THC: Can you tell why are you here at Harvard? And how does that relate to “Triptych?”
KS: One of the things the Theater, Dance, and Media department has been interested in is how the inquiries around theater, the inquiries around performance can be research-based creative inquiries. So much of my work, both in thinking about social practice and creative practice and thinking about formal and aesthetic exploration, is rooted in ongoing research practices. So the conversation with the Theater, Dance, and Media team started with this exciting moment where that department is thinking about how their processes integrate with this broader community at Harvard. And that is what interested me in teaching the workshop and then the course next semester.
THC: Can you tell me more about the workshop?
KS: There are two workshops in November that I will be leading as a way to meet the student body. I deeply believe in collaboration and that the strongest tool of an ensemble is the culture of the group. Before teaching the course next semester, I wanted to have some contact with folks on campus who are thinking about creativity whether they are directly art majors, or students from other disciplines who would be interested in this kind of research practice.
Kaneza Schaal’s latest work, “Triptych,” will play at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theater from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3.

With a catchy but otherwise unremarkable beat and borderline offensive lyrics, Katy Perry’s latest single, “Harleys in Hawaii,” is not only tired, but also incurs a nails-on-the-chalkboard level of cringe.
“Harleys in Hawaii” tells the story of an exotic island romance. Katy Perry escapes from drab reality on the back of a male stud’s motorcycle to a land of cotton candy-colored skies and hula hoops — the epitome of “good times” and “chill vibes only.” The song’s constant repetition of words — “When I hula-hula, hula / So good, you’ll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler”— reinforces the almost hallucinogenic level of tranquility it seeks to cultivate. Everything in this imagined Hawaiian world is carefree and superficial, with no troubling realities to bog Katy Perry and her island down. Meanwhile, the drawing out of “Hawaii-ii-i” makes her getaway fantasy feel infinite. Hawaii just goes on and on and on…even when the listener no longer wants it to.
Without any particularly memorable lyrics or distinct musical qualities, it seems unclear why Katy Perry, a well-established artist, would record what many might consider trashy pop. In addition to its generic nature, “Harleys in Hawaii” lacks a critical level of social consciousness. The depiction of Hawaii as a carefree landscape where Katy Perry can live it up feeds into misleading and privileged perceptions of the island within the greater public as purely a tourist destination. There is zero recognition in the song of any local culture or distinct aspects of the island — Hawaii exists only in the image its reputation cultivates. The song largely sounds like it could have been set anywhere, if not for the alliteration of “Harleys” and “Hawaii.”
The song also tokenizes Katy Perry’s lover, who seems to serve mostly as a vehicle for her fantasy exploits. At the same time, the song infantilizes its female protagonist. Even if Perry does ride a Harley on her own in the music video, she spends most of the time flipping her hair, sipping a piña colada, and acting like she’s on LSD. All the while, the lyrics suggest no dimension to her character outside of her very clearly stated interest in riding on the back of a man’s Harley in Hawaii — and, perhaps, hula-hooping.
This song is a sad fall from Katy Perry’s glory days of “I Kissed a Girl,” “Hot N Cold,” and “California Gurls.” Her provocative, yet well-crafted lyrics in these golden oldies communicate deeper messages to her listeners about defying convention and embracing the spectacle in life. These songs were uniquely and unapologetically “Katy.” From their lyrical content to their more original composition, Katy Perry, in her late 2000s and early 2010s beats, cultivated a sound of her own. Even more recent songs like “Never Really Over,” which tend to have simpler and fewer lyrics, hold some weight by comparison. “Harleys in Hawaii,” does not. The song reflects a pitiful erasure of the iconic Katy Perry that so many people have come to know and love. It sounds like the stock footage of the contemporary pop industry — succeeding, perhaps, at capturing a broader musical trend, but unoriginal and indistinguishable from the general noise.
One can only hope that the old Katy Perry will resurface in a more ambitious single in the future. If “Harleys in Hawaii” is any indication of the Katy Perry to come, it might be time to tune her out.

After months of teasing the release of the second album from The 1975’s “Music for Cars” era, “Notes on a Conditional Form,” the band treated fans with a steady stream of new singles, the third of which dropped on Oct. 24.
The single, “Frail State of Mind,” is characterized by ambient sounds, synths, and drummer George Daniel’s incessant beat, the unconventional timing of which provides a certain sense of inquietitude, adding to the song’s overall theme of living with social anxiety.
The way the song builds reflects frontman Matty Healy’s emotional interiority. Layers upon layers of sound are superimposed throughout the song as the lyrics grow increasingly frustrated. It starts slowly and somewhat peacefully, with ocean noises and synths providing a soothing lull to contrast with Healy’s self-conscious apologies about his mental state. Then highly auto-tuned vocals come in, mimicking and adding to the growing anxiety. Following a slower and stripped-down instrumental break, the whole song speeds up as Healy’s need to stay home (“I wouldn’t know, I’m normally in bed at this time”) becomes more extreme. A blend of samples over the core beat bring the song to it’s climax, driven almost to chaos as the lyric “frail state of mind” is repeated over and over again before again giving in to the calm, the layers falling away to reveal only the ocean.
It’s easiest to evaluate The 1975 in comparison to their larger body of work, in that each new iteration usually sounds very little like their past selves. To put them in a specific genre would be to unfairly trap them in a box they would rather not stay in for more than a couple years at most. With different “eras” dominating their music, from their black and white-filtered, self-titled indie rock era to their bubblegum pop era, to their current era, a heavily produced blend of electropop, rock, and RnB, the only reasonable expectation of each new release is that it will be nothing like the last one.
“Frail State of Mind,” is an exception to this rule. Rather than radically changing their sound yet again, as hinted at with the earlier two singles from the album “People” and “The 1975,” the latter featuring a speech by none other than climate activist Greta Thunberg, this single offers a reprise to their last album, “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships.”
At first listen, the intro sounds very much like “How to Draw / Petrichor,” with its syncopated drumming and the light synth that plays on top of it, as well as its heavy use of ambien noises such as crashing waves and hazy vocals. Once the chorus kicks in, devotees of the band are instantly reminded of “TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME.” The melody is almost exactly the same, bringing the listener back to the happy mindset of the much poppier tune while Healy croons about wanting to stay at home rather than plague the people around him with his anxiety: “I wouldn’t know, I’m normally in bed at this time / You guys, go do your thing / And I’ll just leave at nine / Don’t wanna bore you with my frail state of mind.” The melody, too, is at times reminiscent of “I Like America & America Likes Me,” also off of “A Brief Inquiry.”
“Frail State of Mind” is the link between the two “Music for Cars” albums — something new for the band, as most of their eras have only been one album. Their sound remains recognizable here, providing a comfort much like the comfort Healy claims to get by staying home with what’s familiar. It’s also a comfort that undeniably won’t last long, as the rest of the album will probably continue their practice of veering into previously uncharted territory, cementing The 1975 as a genre-bending yet unapologetically pop group.

Common Holly wants you to be sad. Her official Facebook page describes her work as being for people who like sad songs, and the tracks on her sophomore record, “When I say to you Black Lighting,” certainly follow the recipe for stirring depressing emotions. Her production is stripped back — most songs feature a single guitar, drums, and a violin — and her lyrics, such as “I think we’ve been measured out for pain since birth” from “Measured,” are sung in a delicate, longing voice. The components are all there, but unfortunately, Common Holly’s wispy, feminine voice crooning over a soft guitar isn’t quite enough to inspire the sadness that she — or her chosen persona – undoubtedly feels. Both the production and the lyrics contribute to what makes this album a good listen, but it spirals into repetitiveness the more you listen.
Like her previous record, “Playing House,” on “When I say to you Black Lightning,” Common Holly focuses on using minimal instrumentation and unrefined production. The record invites listeners into a recording studio session with Common Holly. It provides an intimate and comfortable feeling absent from music with more complex production. All of the songs on “When I say to you Black Lightning” feature a combination of a guitar, drums, flute, and violin. These instruments do the heavy lifting on the album and, as a result, the songs tend to lose their individuality and the album becomes sonically repetitive. Many of the songs on the nine-track record begin with Common Holly singing over a slow guitar, or a slow guitar and simple drum beat, before the tempo inevitably increases and more instruments are added to up the intensity. It would be a good formula if used sparingly, but it is the musical thread that holds this album together. The sadness that is trying to be evoked is overwhelmed by a monotonous motif.
All this is not to say that none of Common Holly’s songs are stirring, because they do have their moments. “Uuu,” “It’s not real,” and “Joshua Snakes” are the most compelling tracks on the record. On “Uuu,” as the single guitar plays, Common Holly sings, “build your fire and watch everyone burn is that gonna make you feel better” and when the instrumentation reaches a crescendo she sings, “The river runs cold but you run colder.” On “It’s not real” a chorus of voices — some Common Holly’s, others not — begin and end the song chanting, “It’s not real if I forget it,” giving the track a spiritual effect. On “Joshua Snakes,” Common Holly accuses some unknown person, or thing, of being a super villain. “You’re like a hot super villain at the top of your game / I tried collecting all the evidence to give you the blame,” Common Holly sings, making the song feel like an ode to a supervillain. The syncopated guitar and drum beats, interspersed with a sinister sounding flute, lend a chaotic, sensual feel. Then the song tops off with the introduction of a distorted and gnarly guitar riff that plays as Holly chants, “Can’t get enough, can’t get enough, can’t enough can’t enough, can you?”
Although these tracks are strong on their own, the overall record suffers from the vague and often simplistic style of its lyrics. In many of the songs, such as “Central Booking” and ”Little Down,” Common Holly addresses a vague “you” character. In “Central Booking” she repeats, “With a trashcan full of blood and hair / you need to get yourself out of there” and “I’m sorry New York broke you.” It is difficult to decipher who this “you” is; It could be Common Holly, someone in her life, the audience, or no one at all. But instead of the song riding on the intriguing mystery of this “you,” it creates an abstraction that is difficult to relate to, and more importantly, feel sad about. Common Holly’s lyrics are also often repetitive and simple such as on “You Dance,” where she repeats the phrases “Don’t be afraid,” “Don’t be panicked,” and “Don’t freak out.” Whether this is a reassuring message for herself or a call to arms to the audience it’s emotional impact is not as strong as it should be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Open a history textbook, and you’ll find that few monarchs have risen to power as quickly as King Princess. 20-year-old singer-songwriter Mikaela Straus made Brooklyn her palace and music her ticket to pop royalty without ever donning a crown. With the 2018 release of her debut single, she became the first signee to Mark Ronson’s label Zelig Records. Straus’ subsequent flurry of singles, covers, and EPs earned her an entourage of loyal fans befitting of her stage name, which she chose to represent the “complexity of [her] gender.” Straus, who identifies as genderqueer and lesbian, pays homage to love in all its forms on her debut album, “Cheap Queen.”
For Straus, “Cheap Queen” is more than just another royal title — she conceived the album’s name as a nod to the drag performers whose theatrical glamour influences both her songwriting process and stage presence. “I’m a huge supporter and fan of drag,” she said in a 2018 interview with Harper’s Bazaar. “When I do makeup, it's performative … I use it as a tool to talk about gender and sexuality.” Like the iridescent eyeshadow and bold lipstick she sports on the cover of “Cheap Queen,” Straus’ music provides a vibrant canvas for her views.
On the title track, clean synths and a painstakingly precise drumbeat hold the languid lilt of Straus’ voice in place. The lines “I’m a cheap queen / I can be what you like,” which she delivers with enough detached self-assurance to rival the most pampered of princesses, affirm her belief in fluidity on multiple scales. On a personal level, Straus could be conveying the importance of adaptability in a relationship; the song’s leisurely pace and conversational tone suggest a meeting with a lover or close friend. The lyrics could also be an attempt to highlight the malleability of her artistic persona and even gender itself. Either way, the seemingly endless iterations of the chorus give listeners plenty of chances to guess her intentions. Although slight changes in instrumentation introduce much-needed variety, the song’s repetitiveness is far from subtle. But with Straus’ knack for crafting instantly memorable tunes, who can blame her for throwing nuance to the wind? She’ll still have you humming “Cheap Queen” for days.
The extended instrumental intro to “Useless Phrases” proves that Straus’ melodies are just as compelling without words. After nearly 40 seconds of overlapping synth motifs, Straus rebukes an ex with petulant bravado: “You say you want me back / And I don’t usually entertain such useless phrases,” she sings, enunciating each fierce syllable with doubt and yearning. As the track fades out, though, an unexpectedly sullen outro undermines her apparent resolve.
Straus lends her deceptively simple lyrics an added layer of meaning by challenging traditional conceptions of sexuality and gender roles, especially on the album’s many love songs. The searching guitar ballad “Ain’t Together,” sustained by softly strummed chords and Straus’ coolly heartrending inflection, explores the emotional upheaval of falling in love while questioning the necessity of commitment. On “Prophet,” alternating verses of expressive crooning and breathy falsetto build to a lavish, visceral finale as Straus reflects on the obsessive allure of romance and fame. “Watching My Phone” reveals her talent for generating pathos from the mundane, framing the chorus’ two repeating lines — “Watching my phone / Thinking ‘bout you” — with melancholic strings. Her breezy flair belies a preternatural understanding of love’s purpose in a world sometimes reluctant to accept it.
With the release of “Cheap Queen,” Straus cements her place in the kingdom of pop, marking the first chapter in her storybook career. Cheap or not, King Princess is a queen like no other, and nothing can stop her ascent to the throne. Long may she reign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, I fought with one of my blockmates over our rooming situation. Initially, our blocking group decided to have two common rooms where one would be the actual “common room” and the other was split amongst myself and another roommate as a bedroom.
When I returned to campus, I thought the bigger room should become the bedroom, since people would actually live there. One of my blockmates, who used the designated common room far more than I did, fervently disagreed. On our first day back, a shouting match erupted. Another roommate, who I consider one of my closest friends, was in the room listening. When I asked him if he agreed with me, he demurred. He had no position on the matter.
I was furious. Not with the roommate who I had gotten into an argument with, but with my best friend, who had removed himself from a fight I ended up losing. At the time, I had been reminded of a Martin Luther King, Jr. quote, “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” That same quote has been ringing in my head since U.S. President Donald J. Trump decided to withdraw American troops from Syria’s northern border with Turkey. Trump’s decision ultimately cleared the way for a Turkish invasion of land belonging to the Kurds, a key American ally in the fight against the Islamic State, or ISIS.
Compared to my own infinitesimal fight, I can only imagine the anguish, anger, and betrayal the Kurds must feel toward the United States. Unfortunately, their plight has already faded from the headlines. Turkey continues to fight the Kurds despite an ongoing ceasefire, but people are already moving on to the next story — they must not. The Kurds’ story needs to be told as it continues to evolve and as the damaging consequences for future American foreign policy are realized.
The Turkish invasion that followed American withdrawal has already killed “scores of civilians and hundreds of combatants” while driving “300,000 people from their homes.” It has also destroyed the truce in northern Syria and given an opportunity for ISIS to resurge.
All that, however, pales in significance to the betrayal.
In the coalition to defeat ISIS, Kurdish forces fought with American soldiers to defeat the caliphate. As noted in the Economist, “the superpower had fused its matchless intelligence-gathering with a local ally to drive out the world’s worst terrorists at a relatively modest cost in blood and treasure” — and with success, I might add.
That success has been reversed. More importantly, American credibility has been upended. The Kurds were good friends and good allies. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director and General David H. Petraeus noted that when he visited northern Iraq, the Kurds would say that their “‘only friends are the mountains.’” Petraeus told them, “‘No, no, no. You have the Americans.’” Not anymore.
Some commentators are not surprised that Trump betrayed the Kurds, since “[b]etrayal is a leitmotif for the president’s entire life.” Perhaps they are right. Trump’s desire to betray the Kurds should come as no surprise. The surprise, then, is that the rest of the American government did nothing to delay Trump’s decision or protect the Kurds.
Senator Lindsey O. Graham (R-SC) can try to earn “Profiles in Courage” points by saying the Kurds have been “shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration” — but talk is cheap. Graham, and everyone else in the Republican Party or the bureaucracy, who lukewarmly condemned Trump on this issue, did nothing to thwart this decision. And, if their response is that they could not do anything, maybe that should warn us about the “imperial presidency” that influences American foreign policy.
Regardless, the damage is done. If you want to begin hypothesizing about the magnitude of the repercussions, look to Thucydides’ “The History of the Peloponnesian War.”
During the famous Melian Dialogue, the Athenians give the Melians an ultimatum: surrender to Athens or be destroyed. Among other things, the Melians argue that they will not surrender because the Athenians’ rival, the Spartans, “are bound, if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their kindred,” the Melians. The Athenians replied, that “when their own interests or their country’s laws are in question,” the Spartans “are the worthiest men alive” but they consider “what is agreeable honorable, and what is expedient just. Such a way of thinking does not promise much for the safety which you now unreasonably count upon.” Sound familiar?
The Athenians were right. When they laid siege to Melos, the self-interested Spartans were nowhere to be found — and the Melians paid for it. Throughout the rest of the war, during the Peace of Nicias and Battle of Mantinea, Spartan’s allies began to distrust the Spartan commitment and turned against the superpower — weakening its strategic position.
As the U.S. demonstrates that it does not value loyalty, its rivals (Russia and China) will feel more emboldened to annex or bully America’s allies because they know the U.S. will not come to the rescue. Our own allies, in Europe or Asia, may also soon realize that Americans are not the best of friends or the worst of enemies. They are fickle and unreliable — an American commitment becomes as useless as a sunroom on a submarine.

“That's all we've done. That's all Phillip and l have done. He and I have lived what you and I have talked.”
Alfred Hitchcock’s 1948 film, “Rope,” is the tale of the “perfect murder” committed by two young Harvard University graduates and serves as a dramatic parable for academia. The two protagonists strangle an old University classmate as an intellectual exhibition, then assemble a dinner party with the guests chosen for dramatic effect. Among the guests is their prep-school housemaster and inspiration, Rupert Cadell, portrayed by the legendary James M. “Jimmy” Stewart.
The perpetrators’ defense of course is that they were simply applying Nietzschean theory taught to them and endorsed by Rupert. Their mentor, angry and disgusted with his old students, gives an impassioned speech against their immorality. However, he fails to accept virtually any responsibility for advocating for the ideas that inspired them. Although this is the most extreme example, this story possesses a moral for the stewards of higher education.
Ideas are incredibly powerful and their practical consequences must be contemplated thoroughly in the classroom. Professors and other academics must consider the effects of their theoretical work and educators from all fields and departments must ensure that that the ethical considerations are taught in conjunction with the standard material.
I recently witnessed my own professor dismiss concerns that his methods were unethical by stating “That’s an ethics question; that’s for a different class.” Harvard cannot educate its students this way.
The University wants its students to make a difference in the world, but ivory tower thinking — theory devoid of practical ethics — renders this mission impossible. And even worse, the lack of an ethical education may leave serious blindspots for graduates that can have serious consequences for the world at large.
Obviously the vast majority of ethical responsibility lies with students. This call for ethical education does not place the blame for wrong-doing on educators. To do this would be to remove the agency of students. However, as they attempt to mold young minds, educators have their own responsibility as well.
The University needs to forward programs similar to Embedded EthiCS, the collaboration between the Philosophy and Computer Science departments. The incorporation of ethical considerations should not be limited to computer science concentrators. All concentrations should seriously consider incorporating ethics into their core curriculum.
The Ethical Reasoning requirement exists ostensibly for this purpose, but there is bound to be a disconnect between those General Education classes and a student’s concentration. An ethical reasoning education should be far more effective when it’s applied to one’s specific area of expertise.
If the University wishes to produce more innovators at the level of success and impact of Mark E. Zuckerberg, then it needs to ensure that they have a greater understanding of the ethics behind their work. For years now, Facebook has been embroiled in multiple scandals with heavy consequences. The company’s original motto was “Move Fast, Break Things,” and although this has been amended, it indicates a goal of innovation without deliberation, which is a recipe for disaster. For the future, Harvard should be trying to cultivate leaders who permanently retain ethical considerations in their mental foreground.
“Rope” is based on a true story of the murder of a teenager by two men named Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb in the twenties. The Chicago-based murderers were recent graduates of the University of Chicago. However, the film version changed their alma mater to Harvard and situated them in a swanky Manhattan penthouse that looks down on the rest of the city. While we cannot confidently know the writers’ intent, this appears to ratchet up the viewer’s perception that these two men have a strong sense of superiority and feel that they exist on a plane above the rest of society. Harvard’s stellar reputation seems to go back a few years.
If Harvard wants its global reputation to be a place that cultivates future leaders that leave a positive impact on the world than it needs to place a higher value on applied ethics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike the music festival sharing with which it shares its acronym, the First-Year Retreat and Experience is here to stay. Last week, the college permanently added FYRE to its collection of pre-orientation programs. First piloted for the freshman class of 2022, it is designed to help incoming students from disadvantaged backgrounds adjust to life at Harvard.
Student leaders of FYRE have done an excellent job not only getting this program off the ground in its pilot phase but also getting it institutionalized. The wildly positive response from participating freshmen is a testament to the skill and initiative displayed by these leaders and their intensive efforts.
Recognizing that the College was in desperate need of a bridge program for these students, who often lack the networks of knowledge and relationships that more privileged students have upon arriving on campus, the designers and coordinators of FYRE persevered against institutional resistance. As we have opined in the past, this sort of leadership and problem-solving is essential to a vibrant and progressive campus. We join others in our community in thanking them for that outsized effort.
That said, we are disappointed that this program wasn’t spearheaded long ago by the administration. Two years ago, administrators did exactly that. In response to our staff editorial encouraging the advancement of FYRE, Dean of the College Rakesh Kharana and former Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 wrote an op-ed criticizing the bridge program as too narrow. To be sure, the two deans offered a thorough counter proposal, but we would posit that in doing so they missed an essential component of FYRE’s significance. Student initiative matters, and programs that are advocated for and designed by students should be prioritized not merely because they are rooted in experience but also because they have the support on campus to really take root.
In brief, the administration should be the wind at students’ back, not a force of opposition. Unfortunately, when it comes to FYRE, the administration failed in that regard.
Moreover, we look to Freshman Scholars at Yale, a five-week summer program combining academic for-credit courses, resource orientation, and community building, and Princeton’s Freshman Scholars Institute, a similar seven-week program that can be extended into the academic year, as models for expansion of FYRE going forward. Both programs provide examples of ways in which FYRE can become both deeper and more lasting, as Harvard catches up on the critical problem of helping low-income and first-generation students adjust to college life early.
The pre-orientation programs often serve as students’ first opportunity to establish lasting friendships at Harvard. Many know of the cliques that may form with programs; the First-Year Outdoor Program friendship is basically a cliche. While it is surely a positive that students can get so close so soon, Harvard should do more work to mix different pre-orientation groups once they arrive on campus.
Siloing by pre-orientation group would be especially harmful in the case of the FYRE program. Many may feel that our campus is poorly integrated socioeconomically, so it is crucial that measures are taken to prevent disadvantaged students from being further isolated from the more well-off subcultures of Harvard. The University should consider rearranging the schedule of Opening Days so students do not have to choose between FYRE and another program if they would like to do both. This would allow for these students to have the opportunity to integrate into multiple communities and support networks before arriving on campus.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

As Harvard continues to face scrutiny for accepting donations from controversial figures, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an interview Thursday that Harvard must take a “principled approach” to deciding when to return gifts.
Garber said Thursday there “may well” be occasions when a gift should be returned, and administrators should be conscious of changing attitudes nationwide regarding certain donations.
“As you very well know, we have a Gift Policy Committee — the University-wide Gift Policy Committee — that is charged with interpreting existing policies to questions such as this,” Garber said. “And let me say that for leaders, probably every nonprofit institution, a major challenge is that norms are changing nationwide, expectations are changing.”
Garber chairs the Gift Policy Committee, which is made up of faculty members and administrators who review donations. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to provide The Crimson with a copy of the gift policy and refused to disclose members of the Committee in May. He again declined to provide information about the committee for this story.
Swain wrote in a May statement that Harvard accepts donations in “good faith” that will have a positive impact on research, scholarship, and student experiences at the University. Harvard’s policies dictate that donors cannot try to influence the University’s activities through their gifts, according to Swain.
Over the past year, Harvard has come under fire for its financial ties to billionaire donor and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein, philanthropist and drug marketer Arthur M. Sackler, and the Saudi Arabian government. These donations have spurred multiple protests and in the case of Epstein, a review led by the Office of the General Counsel.
Epstein, who has long-standing ties to Harvard, died in a suicide in August after facing multiple allegations that he sexually abused underage girls. The Miami Herald reported in November 2018 that Epstein operated a sex ring out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home and identified roughly 80 women who allege Epstein molested or sexually abused them before 2006.
Harvard has also faced criticism for its connection to the Sackler Family, which activists argue has ties to OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma and has played a role in the opioid epidemic. Activists have urged Harvard to remove Arthur M. Sackler’s name from the Harvard Art Museums.
Since 2018, activists have organized protests and politicians like United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called on Harvard to remove Sackler’s name from campus. Other museums across the world — including the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art — have already cut ties with the family and, in some cases, renamed art galleries that previously bore the Sackler name.
As Provost, Garber oversees the Harvard Art Museums, and he reiterated Bacow’s view that Harvard should not remove Sackler’s name from campus because Sackler had been dead several years before Purdue Pharma first manufactured OxyContin.
“From a legal perspective, as I understand it, it's questionable whether we could remove his name,” Garber said. “But from an ethical perspective, I am troubled by the notion that because somebody shares a family name, or its relative, that they are treated as though they are guilty for the transgressions of other people.”
Garber said though the public perception of non-profit institutions accepting gifts is evolving, Harvard must continue to be cautious in making decisions on whether to reject or return donations.
“We recognize that we need to have the ability to respond to changing public views of such gifts,” Garber said. “But although we must be flexible, we also have to be, we absolutely need to be principled in our approach to these issues.”

More than 300 Harvard Law School students have signed onto a public letter calling on Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 to re-institute longer hours at campus cafes and address what they say is chronic understaffing at those foodservice locations.
The letter is also addressed to Restaurant Associates General Manager Lauren Williams, whose company contracts with the Law School to provide dining management services. The letter argues that mealtimes are “hectic,” and reduced hours and understaffing inconvenience students who rely on afternoon snacks and meals to get through long class days. The letter also states that reduced hours and understaffing put a strain on dining employees.
It includes eight demands, including returning to the Law School’s former dining schedule, scheduling dining staff and catering staff for eight-hour shifts instead of “split shifts,” and ensuring all dining and catering staff are notified of their schedules at least seven days ahead of shifts.
The Law School’s Labor and Employment Action Project organized the letter, which they began circulating among students last week.
First-year Law Student Zachary P. Boullt said LEAP decided to write the letter after having conversations with the dining hall workers and learning about their working conditions.
“We had individual conversations with different workers at the time about the conditions and then based on that, we were motivated to get the letter together,” Boullt said.
Third-year law student and organizer Rachel Sandalow-Ash said dining employees’ descriptions of their work conditions were troubling and she believes the school owes them more respect.
“The fact that people weren't getting enough hours to support their families, that they were asked to work at a pace that was unsafe, the fact that dining workers were being harassed for taking sick days was all really troubling,” Sandalow-Ash said. “They've always stood with us so we wanted to stand with them.”
Restaurants Associates Senior Vice President of Creative Services Sam Souccar wrote in an emailed statement that the company is “committed” to employees and patrons of dining locations and noted that most of the dining employees are represented by local unions.
“While we have not had these issues raised in any formal process or forum, we are willing to meet with the union representatives and discuss any issue regarding the terms and conditions of employment for our employees at the HLS raised by the Union or our employees,” Souccar wrote.
“We will reserve further comment on these issues out of respect to the collective bargaining and grievance processes we are obligated to follow. We know that all parties are committed to ensuring that the students, faculty, and staff at HLS experience the optimal dining experience,” he added.
Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that the Law School has several on-campus dining options available to students, including a cafe that reopened last fall. He also wrote that the Law School has contacted Restaurant Associates to ensure any possible employment issues are resolved.
“HLS values the work of everyone in our community and is committed to fostering the well-being of every person on our campus, including staff employed by outside contractors,” he wrote. “With that in mind, we have reached out to representatives of Restaurant Associates, the outside company that manages and employs the staff at all three existing campus dining facilities, to request information and to ensure that, if there are any employment issues between the two parties, those are appropriately addressed.”
Signees also referenced UNITE HERE Local 26 — the Boston-based labor union that represents dining employees — and asked them to work with Manning and Williams to implement the demands listed.
The union did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In addition to individual students, three additional campus organizations signed onto the letter — La Alianza, Lambda at Harvard Law School, and the People’s Parity Project.
Lambda Co-President Matthew P. Shields said that while he cannot speak for the entire board, the organization has taken an interest in labor issues in recent years.
“We have supported ending mandatory arbitration clauses this year,” Shields said, describing efforts last year to end contracts that require employees to resolve workplace disputes with employers through an arbitration process, rather than through the courts. “We also voted to support and endorse the graduate students in [their] strike authorization vote. I think that this is just another reflection of where we stand in supporting labor rights.”
In addition to Lamba’s support, Shields said he personally signed the letter because he cares about Law School dining employees and because it brought his attention to the impact of last year’s changes beyond the student population.
“I knew exactly what's going on with the change of hours in terms of what that meant for students, but definitely not for workers,” he said.

Harvard scientists have engineered a structural innovation in lab-grown meat that gives it a more palatable, realistic texture, according to a paper published in Science of Food last week.
Led by bioengineering research associate Luke A. MacQueen, the team induced cow and rabbit muscle cells to grow on gelatin scaffolds, which lend the product a fibrous “mouth-feel” characteristic of meat. By contrast, the previous method available — which McQueen described as growing an unstructured “pile of cells” — deprives the consumer of a “tender” texture.
MacQueen said the technique used to construct the edible scaffolds was “inspired by a cotton candy machine.”
“We're making something that you could consider a bit to be like protein fibers — so protein candy, or protein fluff,” he said. “In this paper, we use gelatin because it's a natural part of tissues. And when we make scaffolds based on it, the cells love it, and they crawl inside and organize into tissue that looks and feels a lot like meat.”
Postdoctoral research fellow Christophe O. Chantre, who co-authored the study, said that while alternative meat products like the Impossible Burger are currently “wildly popular,” he believes lab-grown meat is on the cusp of exploding in popularity.
“I think this is really going to become actually a big part of our market of meat as we move forward in the next couple decades,” he said. “And it has these added benefits that it uses a lot less resources and eliminates cruel animal treatments.”
MacQueen said such ethical implications motivated him throughout the project.
“I like meat a lot, and I like animals a lot, so if I got to have my meat without killing them, then I would,” he said. “I would be a consumer of this product.”
He added that in the future, scientists may be able to use the technique to create a wide range of commercial products.
“Because our scaffold can kind of accept any type of cell, there's a lot of interesting possible tissues for us to make,” he said. “A chicken breast or a piece of shrimp or steak or a liver — all of those are things that we could make.”
The team is working with Harvard’s Office of Technology Development to protect its intellectual property and liaise with potential commercial partners.
Chantre said that though the study was simply a “proof of concept” and did not attempt to optimize the economic efficiency of its product, the high price of lab-grown meat would likely be “a major concern” if the new product goes on the market.
“I think the cost is definitely something that will be addressed with scale,” Chantre said.

More than 50 people gathered Monday evening to discuss ongoing protests against the proposed construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Mauna Kea summit of Hawaii’s Big Island.
Speakers at the event debated plans for the telescope, which have come under fire from thousands of Native Hawaiians in part because of Mauna Kea’s cultural and religious significance. The Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies, Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe, and Native Americans at Harvard College co-sponsored the event.
Since July, protesters have blocked the single access road at the base of Mauna Kea, preventing construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope and largely shutting down operations at the existing telescopes on the summit.
Jocelyn L. Doane, the public policy manager at the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, weighed in via Skype call during the event, arguing that astronomical development on top of the mountain by various universities and research institutions has come at the expense of cultural stewardship.
“Many Native Hawaiians believe that Mauna Kea is the home of many gods,” she said. “Mauna Kea’s cultural, environmental, and historic development should inform its use and management.”
The University of Hawaii, which is overseeing the project, has stated on its website that the telescope’s construction follows all applicable laws, and the university has received a permit for the telescope’s development.
“I would really encourage everyone to learn as much about this issue as possible,” University of Hawaii Communications Director Dan Meisenzahl wrote in an emailed statement. “It’s not a black and white issue. It’s fair to say that certainly not all Native Hawaiians are opposed to the telescope on Mauna Kea.”
Approximately a dozen telescopes are already operational on the summit. The Submillimeter Array, one of the existing telescopes, is partly operated by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
Director of Hawaii Operations of the Submillimeter Array Simon J.E. Radford wrote in an emailed statement that the Submillimeter Array is not connected to the Thirty Meter Telescope.
“The SMA appreciates the privilege of operating on Maunakea, one of the few places on earth where submillimeter astronomy is possible,” Radford wrote. “The SMA is committed to full compliance with all terms of its permits and agreements.”
Though the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy — of which Harvard is a member — is associated with the international partnership that is developing the Thirty Meter Telescope, the University has not invested in the telescope, according to Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Director Charles R. Alcock.
Ku’ulei Perreira-Keawekane, who has participated in the protests, said at Monday's event she was motivated by her religious beliefs and way of life, which she believes have been ignored by the telescope’s developers and Hawaiian government.
“Aboriginal people of Hawaii are continuously ignored, and that accumulates to cultural trauma, which I am suffering from as a Native person in this day and age, and my relationship with the Mauna has helped me to cope with these things,” Perreira-Keawekane said.
Some critics have portrayed the controversy over the telescope’s construction as a debate between science and religion — a framing Doane called “ridiculous.”
“We’re absolutely pro-scientists and pro-science. Our ancestors were amazing scientists.” Doane said. “The specialness of this place and uniqueness of this place should be informing how it is developed and managed and used.”
TAPAS member Julie S. Chung ’20, who helped organize the event, said she believes in the importance of having a conversation at Harvard about the protests in Hawaii.
“I think as an institute of higher education that obviously does fund and do a lot of science research here, it’s really important as students to see how much this issue has been about the purported benefits of science and knowledge but at the expense of Native Hawaiians,” she said. “To bring that conversation here is really important for us and I think also just the responsibility of TAPAS.”
Harvard Medical School student Nathan J. Nakatsuka ’12, who is a member of the Harvard University Hawaii Club, said he thinks the event facilitated an important conversation.
“I thought this was a really good event for a lot of people to understand what’s going on from a Hawaiian cultural perspective and how it relates to other issues,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economist Emmanuel Saez proposed tax reforms to alleviate America’s wealth disparity in a lecture on economic inequality at the Harvard Kennedy School Monday evening.
Saez, a professor and director of the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley, advocated implementing a progressive annual tax for those over a certain net-worth threshold to curb the growing disparity in wealth. Saez has advised Democratic presidential candidate and United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and the concept of a wealth tax on the ultra-rich has become a central policy in Warren’s campaign.
In response to an American economy that “has not worked for the bottom 50 percent,” Saez proposed solutions that he says would not only help reduce the wealth disparity, but also better regulate tax evasion. Saez said multinational corporations, like Amazon and Apple, are particularly adept at evading higher corporate taxes in the United States, filing taxes in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg instead.
“The U.S. could essentially crack down on multinational tax evasion, using things, you know, that already exist in a real form,” he said, referring to government data. “Mainly, we think the best way to tax the profits of U.S. multinationals is to impose a minimum tax on country-by-country profits of multinationals because the IRS already connects the information of where Google is making its profits country-by-country and how much Google is paying in corporate taxes in each of those countries.”
Saez added that it is important that explanations of current economic issues are accessible to the general public.
“If you [research] something relevant in the current debate, it’s not too hard to translate it to a broader audience,” he said. “My fear, and maybe that would be considered as too much of a criticism of economics, is that if you can’t really translate what you’re doing for a broader audience, I worry that what you might have found might not be that relevant for what’s going on in the world.”
Judith Merkies, a former member of the European Parliament for the Netherlands and lecture attendee, said Saez’s discussion of multinational corporations was particularly relevant to her home country, which is generally sought out as a tax haven. She compared today’s inequality between economic classes to a “volcano,” but said that Saez’s “tycoon tax” could help alleviate the wealth gap.
“If everyone can vote, and if so many people are suffering because of our tax system whereas only a very small percentage has big gains to reap from it, I think inequality will definitely be — [I] think it is already — a hot political topic. It will trickle down to the whole electorate,” she said
Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for ING Germany and a 2019 John F. Kennedy Memorial Policy Fellow, said Saez’s talk was informative and proactive in addressing the prominence of inequality today.
“[Saez] is really proactive in addressing this,” Brzeski said. “I think the topic will gain more momentum, not only in the U.S. but in Europe and other countries, and I think it’s very easy to recalibrate the tax system without hurting too many people, but with big gains for the broader public."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of activists and legal experts pushed for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and stressed the importance of political activism at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Monday night.
Harvard Institute of Politics Resident Fellow LaTosha Brown, League of Women Voters CEO Virginia Kase, and former Stanford Law School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan served as panelists. All three speakers offered their support for the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would guarantee equal rights regardless of sex.
The American Bar Association co-hosted the event, which was dubbed “Fighting for Political Power: Women’s Inclusion from the 19th Amendment to 2020.” Sarah Wald, an adjunct lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, moderated the talk.
Panelists discussed a wide array of issues, including the women’s suffrage movement, voter suppression, and the importance of voter participation.
Sullivan said she hopes the Equal Rights Amendment will be ratified in her lifetime.
“We are the only industrialized democracy with a bill of rights in the world that doesn’t have a gender equality provision in the Constitution,” she said.
First proposed in 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was approved by Congress in 1972. It failed, however, to receive support from three-fourths of the states, which is necessary for ratification. The proposed amendment is currently just one state shy of the total of 38 needed.
Despite some opposition from legal scholars, Sullivan said she believes that, if another state were to sign on to the proposal now, it could still be ratified under the Constitution.
“I believe, and I’ve testified to Congress, that if we got a 38th state now, it could still be ratified because nothing in Article 5 — which provides for Constitutional amendments — puts a time limit on ratification,” she said.
American Bar Association President Judy P. Martinez, who introduced the panel, said in an interview after the discussion that she found Sullivan’s legal arguments to be “fascinating.”
“I have a daughter and I have three sons,” Martinez said. “For each of their futures, I want to make sure that there is, in fact, a day in this country where women have equal rights on every front.”
Brown, who co-founded the Black Voters Matter Fund, said later in the discussion that she thinks political organizing will be important in order to bring about social change in the United States.
“How do we take this radical reimagining of America and move that forward?” Brown asked. “It doesn’t happen through the courts. It doesn’t happen through legislation. It happens through people and organization.”
Zeena Lattouf, a Harvard Kennedy School student and event attendee, said it was important to her to see women take the lead.
“It’s inspiring to be around so many strong women of different backgrounds both professionally and culturally,” Lattouf said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team started its season on a high note Friday night.
Powered by a hat trick from sophomore Kristin Della Rovere, the Crimson (1-0-0, 1-0-0 ECAC) raced past Dartmouth (0-1-0, 0-1-0 ECAC), 7-4, in the first game of the 2019-20 season.
Della Rovere, who led Harvard in scoring and was second in points last winter, notched all three of her goals in the third period, turning a one-goal game into a blowout victory.
“There were a lot of really good things that we did,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It’s always nice to score seven goals and get the offense going. Obviously it’s early in the season, there’s a lot for us to work on, but I like where we start.”
The Crimson’s offensive showing was encouraging. Harvard scored seven goals in a game just once last season, and Friday marked the first time in four years that the Crimson has posted that many goals against an ECAC opponent.
Despite Harvard’s offensive onslaught, the Big Green never went away in the contest. When the Crimson jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the first period, Dartmouth slowly clawed back to get within one goal in the second.
“I think the thing that impressed me the most about our game last night was how, when Dartmouth came a little closer to us, we pulled away a couple times,” Stone said. “That showed me a lot, that we were able to answer pretty quickly.”
Delle Rovere’s flurry of third period goals ultimately put the game away for Harvard. The hat trick was the first of the sophomore’s collegiate career.
“I think, in the first game of the season, there’s going to be ups and there’s going to be downs,” said Harvard sophomore Dominique Petrie, who led the Crimson in points with two goals and two assists Friday. “One thing that we learned from last night was that you can never take the foot off the gas because it might let the other team jump back in it. Even though they did kind of come back and battle back, I think we battled even harder and that’s what allowed us to ultimately end up on top last night.”
The Crimson dominated the run of play early in the game, jumping out to a commanding three-goal lead in the first eight minutes.
Sophomore Katie Tresca, who missed the majority of last season due to an injury, scored her first career goal two minutes into the game. Tresca collected a backhanded pass from Petrie and fired a shot from the top of the right faceoff circle that snuck past Big Green goalie Hannah Humphreys (21 saves).
“It was awesome to see Katie Tresca score her first collegiate goal,” Stone said. “She had a tough year last year with a concussion, and to get her back into a jersey and be able to put that one in the back of the net was just awesome. Everyone was so fired up.”
Petrie added her first goal of the game three minutes later, slipping a shot from the doorstop between the post and Humphreys’ left pad. Sophomore Anne Bloomer scored the third Harvard goal at 7:48 in the first when she broke out on an odd-man-rush and fired a shot that went top-shelf past the glove of Humphreys.
The Big Green came roaring back in the second period with goals by freshman Catherine Trevors junior Jennifer Costa.
Petrie notched her second goal late in the second, extending Harvard’s lead back to two, but the Big Green again responded with a goal from freshman Currie Putrah 1:31 into the third period.
Petrie, who plays on a line with Della Rovere and junior Keely Moy, said that the trio’s chemistry “was on fire” in the contest. Moy recorded a career-high three assists, helping the line tally a combined 10 points in the game.
“We were reading each other well, setting each other up nicely,” Petrie said. “My goals could not have come from a solo effort. ... I think that overall, we were reading each other well on the ice, off the ice and all just having so much fun out there. It kind of just allowed our line to really seed and have a good performance.”
That chemistry helped Della Rovere to take over in the third period and score three goals, putting the game out of Dartmouth’s reach.
“I thought we did a really good job of adjusting when they got back in the game a little bit, just taking charge and finishing out strong,” Petrie said.
Harvard sophomore goalie Lindsay Reed turned away 17 shots. Reed, who last year set a single-season program record with 927 total saves, was named The Crimson’s Female Athlete of the Year in May.
Four Harvard freshmen made their debuts Friday.
“I think our freshman class is an extremely talented and skilled class and immediately their impact was felt all over the ice,” Petrie said. “It was great to see them get out there and contribute, do what they can, play their roles and ultimately help us get the W. I’m really excited to see their play develop as the season goes on.”
Harvard will host a pair of conference rivals, Brown and Yale, next weekend.

With the clock winding down and the score tied at 13 against George Washington University, Harvard men’s water polo needed some magic to keep its winning streak intact. Senior Austin Sechrest delivered the goods for Harvard, forcing a late turnover that junior Bruno Snow converted into the decisive goal with 43 seconds remaining. The goal handed Harvard a 14-13 victory and extended their winning streak to 15. Senior Charlie Owens and junior Dennis Blyashov scored four goals apiece to keep Harvard in the match before Snow’s game-winner.
Harvard had little time to recover from the nail-biter against GW before they had to play in another highly contested thriller. The squad edged out Pomono-Pitzer 17-16 in triple overtime to close out day one of the Harvard Invite. Despite leading 11-7 at the half, Pomona-Pitzer closed out regulation with a five-goal run to tie the match. After trading goals in the first two OT periods, Blyashov gave Harvard the victory with a goal 32 seconds into the sudden-death third.
The victory featured strong performances across the board, with four different players contributing at least three goals. Blyashov and junior Jackson Enright each contributed four goals apiece to pace the team’s offense and lead Harvard to victory.
Harvard began the second day of the Harvard Invite with yet another close match, this time outlasting Bucknell 9-8. The team’s offense was largely stagnant during the first half, falling into an early 3-0 hole. But it roared to life at the end of the second quarter, beginning with Alex Tsotadze scoring a 5M penalty shot for the team’s first goal. The team stormed back with a four-goal run in the third quarter to take a 6-5 lead, and fended off a late push by Bucknell to earn the victory.
Sophomore Noah Hodge worked hard to keep Harvard in the match, finishing with a stellar 16 saves. He finished with 38 saves across the event’s first three matches.
“I’m really proud of how our team fought through adversity this weekend, especially on the first three games of the weekend,” said Hodge. “We knew that the games would be all around tough games, but we were confident that if we played our game, we would come out 4-0, which is exactly what we did. Our team’s cohesiveness as a unit drove us through those victories and allowed us to continue our unbeaten run thus far.”
“The weekend was a big weekend for us. The close games gave us a chance to test ourselves and battle adversity,” added Owens.
Fresh off of three hard-fought victories, Harvard closed out the event with a bang by steamrolling La Salle 18-4. Harvard did not trail once during the match — Owens scored 17 seconds into the match and the team never looked back as the squad put together a six-goal run in the second and third quarters. 10 different players scored for Harvard en route to the dominating victory.
After its most recent victories, Harvard’s win streak currently stands at 22. As it tries to extend that this season, the team will stay alert and try to avoid complacency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a consequential loss to Brown (12-1-1, 5-0 Ivy League) one week ago that put the Bears alone atop the Ivy League, the Crimson came out strong against Princeton (5-6-3, 1-3-1 Ivy League) on Saturday, looking to reclaim the momentum that the team had built up before having its seven-game win streak snapped. The game proved to be a difficult test for Harvard, as the match was very tightly contested throughout, but with its back to the wall and the fate of its season potentially at stake, the Crimson stepped up and reasserted itself with a 2-1 victory against none other than the back-to-back Ivy League champions.
The match got off to an unbelievably quick start, as Harvard was able to strike first after only two and a half minutes. The sequence began when sophomore forward Jordan Di Verniero collected the ball on the right wing of the pitch. Di Verniero then went to work, darting down the sideline and taking on the Tiger defense. As two defenders converged on her, Di Verniero demonstrated great foot skills with a fantastic move that allowed her to blow past both. Right as she was about to reach the end line, Di Verniero sent in a great cross from the right corner that connected with the foot of junior forward Murphy Agnew. The clean volley resulted in a hard strike that sent the ball whizzing into the upper left area of the goal before the Princeton goalkeeper could even react to the play. With that, Harvard found itself in an ideal position early on and looked to build on it.
However, despite the rapid start, the remainder of the first half featured back-and-forth play, as each team battled hard without giving up an inch, knowing that the game was far from over. Although the Crimson only got off one more shot in the first half, the defense, anchored by senior goalkeeper Kat Hess, were able to deter any sort of push by the Tigers, and the half concluded with Harvard still clinging to its 1-0 lead.
After coming back out onto the pitch, both teams displayed a newfound fire, with several players rattling off shots that helped to continuously build up tension on the field, as well as among fans in the stands. Something was going to have to give.
The moment came in the 57th minute when junior midfielder Olivia Kane of Princeton converted on a cross to net the tying goal.
It was here that the Crimson faced its most daunting challenge—a loss here would set the team even farther behind Brown. The final 30 minutes would not only decide the game but possibly the season as well. With the Tigers regaining the momentum and Harvard facing a crossroads, the Crimson teammates would have to turn to each other and reinforce the familial identity that they have cultivated throughout this season.
“We are a tight-knit group who share a passion for soccer and competition,” Hess said. “We respect one another and we play as a unit, not as individuals. And during the game, after Princeton tied the score at 1-1, we held those values true, working together, and focusing on our game and what we needed to do rather than on an unfortunate goal against in the second half. We lifted each other up, fought to the end, and left it all out on the field.”
While the goal for the Tigers seemed to threaten the outcome of the game, Harvard remained calm and composed. Each player, knowing that they were going to have to battle together, returned to mid-pitch for the kickoff, looking to do nothing other than stick to its original gameplan: play as a team and win.
And that is exactly what they did.
Two minutes later, after another save by Hess, the Crimson came right back. First-year forward Angela Caloia played a ball back to junior midfielder Maria DiMartinis, who, from Harvard’s end of the field, sent an exceptional through-ball up ahead to a streaking Agnew. Agnew, with a Princeton defender right on her heels, took one touch into the box and fired a shot that narrowly snuck by the Tiger goalkeeper, giving the Crimson the lead once again.
Back on top, Harvard now looked to lock down and hold on for just a short time longer. With Princeton mounting attack after attack, the Crimson defense shut them all down, building more momentum with each clearance. In the 81st minute, with the finish line in sight, Agnew broke out past three Tiger defenders and launched what would have been not only her hat-trick goal, but likely a game-ender. However, the ball was deflected by the Princeton goalkeeper and rolled out of bounds just an inch to the right of the goalpost.
Yet, Harvard remained strong on defense, pushing aside any final attacks. Finally, the thriller of a game came to an end, with the Crimson picking up right where it left off before its game against Brown.
The win could not have come at a more pivotal point in the season. With the pain of the Brown loss in Harvard’s recent memory, the squad had to refocus its preparation and mindset.
“Soccer is a beautiful game,” Hess said. “You win some and you lose some, and unfortunately, we suffered a tough loss against Brown last weekend. But that is what is so great about these girls and this team. We know that in order to be successful, we will fail, because that's how we learn and grow to be better than we were the day before.”
With only two games remaining on the regular-season docket, the Crimson will return to the pitch next Saturday to take on Dartmouth (9-5-1, 0-4-1 Ivy League) at Jordan Field. The match will take on added importance for Harvard because, with the win against the Tigers, the Crimson has managed to restabilize its championship hopes.
“As the saying goes, 'life’s a climb, but the view is great,’” Hess said. “Championships are never handed to you, you have to fight for them every time you put on that jersey and step on that field. We knew that that loss [to Brown] wouldn't cripple us, but instead, drove us to prepare better and work harder for our next match against Princeton.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Little-known fact: on October 26, 1813, the United States invaded Canada. Fortunately for the people of Quebec, poor training and a lack of resources ultimately hindered the American effort to overtake our northern neighbor (but I’d say our revenge was sweeter than a jug of Montreal’s finest maple syrup). However, when it came to the War of 1812 as a whole, the tides turned - the once-defeated American army went on to successfully fend off the United States from the British and their Canadian allies.
On the very same day as that Canadian invasion, albeit 206 years later, the Crimson found itself in a very similar situation.
“Everybody’s ready to go to war,” said Harvard running back BJ Watson before this Saturday’s contest against Princeton. “That’s what this is. We're ready to go to war because that's what this is all about.”
Like the US, the Crimson ended up falling to its rival, losing its battle with the Tigers by a margin of a single touchdown - the squad’s first conference loss of the season. However, with four games to go, Harvard isn’t out of the running for the Ivy League title just yet. The War of 2019 is still anyone’s game.
A PRETTY SPECIAL SQUAD
Going into this weekend’s matchup, the Crimson led the nation in blocked kicks. On Saturday, Harvard’s special teams squad proved its dominance once again, thwarting a Princeton PAT-attempt and clinging to its position atop the record list.
This season has been marked by the Crimson’s command of the kick. On the other side of the pigskin, the crusaders from Cambridge have been just as effective. Senior kicker Jake McIntyre completed his 31st career field goal earlier this year, breaking Harvard’s all-time record with a successful peg through the posts against San Diego. Since then, the Orlando, Fla. native has been unstoppable, blasting an unobstructed three extra points and PAT at Powers Field this weekend.
In a post-game interview, Crimson coach Tim Murphy credited special teams trainer Jon Poppe with Harvard’s kick-time control, applauding the coach for “tak[ing] a lot of pride” in his work.
On the punt front, Harvard’s stats have been very similar. The Crimson leads the Ancient Eight in net punting yards, averaging just over 39 yards per punt. Though this may not be indicative of special-teams dominance in and of itself, the trend continues when it comes to other punting statistics - Harvard ranks toward the top of the conference in both total punt yards and touchbacks, second only to Cornell.
POACHING THE PIGSKIN
Toward the very beginning of this weekend’s contest, things weren’t looking to great for the Crimson. Before the game’s main plotline even began, Princeton receiver Jacob Birmelin snatched a Kevin Davidson-bomb in the endzone, marking the fifth time that Harvard was scored on by its opponent within their first drive.
Tasked with responding to the Tigers’ attack was none other than Crimson quarterback Jake Smith. However, it quickly became apparent that the junior was not up to the task. After a single first down completion, Smith’s lob was picked off by the Princeton defense. Smith’s throws would go on to be picked off twice more.
“Those were terrific plays,” Tigers coach Bob Surace said. “I thought we did a good job disrupting [Smith] when he threw it into coverage. Other than the one we boomeranged back to them, we did a good job capitalizing.”
Those three picks brought Smith’s “passes had intercepted” count up to eight on the season. For comparison, the Princeton offense has only been picked off twice - first in the Ivy League and third in the nation.
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT
For Harvard, this weekend’s contest will tell all. Unless the Crimson can take down the undefeated Big Green, it’s a near-certainty that November’s Dartmouth-Princeton battle, to be fought at Yankee Stadium, will determine the outcome of the Ivy League championship.
This year has been a walk in the park for the Big Green. Dartmouth’s 35-6 takedown of the Jacksonville Dolphins has set the tone for the season; its most challenging game was a 13-point win against Penn. The Big Green offense is championed by quarterback Jared Gerbino, who, in contrast to Smith, has not yet been picked off this season.
Add that to Dartmouth’s impressive defense, and the Big Green has not yet faced a formidable opponent. That all changes this Saturday at Harvard Stadium.
Will Dartmouth’s special teams squad be up to facing its Crimson challenger? Can Jake Smith continue his touchdown-streak without being picked off? Regardless, for Harvard, the war for the Ivy League title continues this weekend.

Why not have matching costumes? At least this way, you’re less likely to lose sight of your significant or not-so-significant other over Halloweekend. Is your S.O. the type of person who ghosts in person? Wearing matching costumes means they’ll have to stick by you the rest of the night for people to understand their costume. Couple costumes are also the best solution to last-minute lack of creativity, for Halloween at least. If you dress up as a black cat on your own, you’re basic. Add in a matching mouse costume, though, and suddenly, it’s cute while giving the illusion of effort. Likewise, cheetah costumes can easily get lost in a crowd. But, upgrade it by getting that person you made out with at the First Chance Dance to dress up as a Cheeto, and you’re a snack (literally)!
Couple costumes also bring you one step closer to trapping that special somebody right before cuffing season. You’ll be guaranteed someone who’s willing to sacrifice their Canada Goose to the Cambridge snow and deliver you snacks, so you can stay full while skimming the first and last paragraphs of your readings. Also, remember that this is Harvard — never stop thinking about future opportunities. In case they become the next Mark Zuckerberg, nothing says “hire me” more than a picture of your Daenerys and Khal Drago costumes that were haphazardly thrown together from your blockmates’ closets stapled to your resume.
This Halloweekend, remember that hangovers will fade along with your memories of the night, but Instagram is forever. And what better to post on your feed than a matching costume?
Hate It: Save your relationship celebrations for Valentine’s Day— Anna M. Peters
Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Peanut Butter and Jelly. Moth and Lamp. Plug and Socket. The list is terrifying and endless. We all love to hate couple’s costumes, but just in case you didn’t already, here are a few of the reasons.
First of all, we get it, you guys love each other. You’re cuffed. There’s no need to dress like it. Second, the time and effort that needs to go into planning and coordinating a unique, authentic couple’s costume is ridiculous. Let’s be real, who actually has the energy for that? Our schedules are already packed with classes, meetings, and of course, our fave: psets.
If those reasons aren’t convincing enough, when are couple’s costumes actually cute instead of cringey? We mean, if you’re extremely talented, then you could finesse your way into making it look original and fun. But, chances are that it won’t, so quit while you’re ahead. Lastly, rumor has it you have to actually have a significant other to do this — upsetting, we know. Even if you are able to execute the art of concocting an original, cute, non-cringey couple’s costume, you have to have a S.O. to wear it with. We don’t need Halloween to be Valentine’s Day 2.0.
At the end of the day, we can’t stop you if your heart’s deepest desire is to get spooky with your boo, but don’t say we didn’t warn you
