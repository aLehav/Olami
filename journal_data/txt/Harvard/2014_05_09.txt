After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks ago I wrote an article about joining the Navy on the anniversary of the Boston marathon bombings, the event that had originally inspired me to be a Naval intelligence officer. I did, in fact, swear in and still encourage undergraduates to consider the military. However, I will not be joining the Navy this summer.
I’d thought about military service for years, so applying always felt like a legitimate option. But after running the marathon last year and watching the first responders, I was struck with an urge—not an urge to do something per se, but to be somebody else.
The process of applying to be an officer took a year; the Navy is no longer in the business of shanghaiing bar hounds. It was a lengthy process entailing exams, x-rays, drug tests, clearance forms, accounting for every job I had taken and every location I had visited, and, occasionally, arriving at the recruiting station at 4:30 am.
The night my recruiter called to inform me I was selected to be a Naval Intelligence officer, I was just sitting down to hear Beethoven’s Eroica. I sat silently, marveling at how I could remain unmoved by this Romantic ode to battle-wrought glory.
Applying had been easy. The hard part was saying yes. After three months, my desk was stained with coffee and littered with lists of pros and cons. I dropped 10 pounds, and I still did not know.
Like most young adults, I responded to this vocational crisis with an existential one. I’ll spare underclassmen some future legwork. The existentialists believed that humans exist before we have a purpose, so we must create one. Humans are unlike a stapler, for example, where the need to staple is a purpose that precedes the existence of the stapler. For us, every action defines our “purpose.” This is as true in theater as it is in life—action reveals character.
So I swore in. It was remarkably unromantic. As I found out, there’s no actual “dotted line” to sign on, only the usual, endless paperwork. “The Navy’s greatest war,” my recruiter informed me, “is the one on trees.”
The morning after I swore in, I received an email offering me what I’d long considered my dream job while sitting in lecture (appropriately about “Paradise Lost”). I felt like tearing out my eyes, rending my clothing, drinking poison, or any number of literary reactions to a tragic turn of events. Not because the message had come ten hours too late, but because I’d sworn the oath to begin with.
In the “Iliad,” Achilles is famously presented with the choice between a short but glorious life in battle and a long but obscure life at home. Achilles chooses glory. Epics aren’t written about people who don’t choose glory. When Odysseus visits him in the afterlife, he recants: “I’d rather slave on earth for another man than rule down here over all the breathless dead.” But his respect for battle-won glory is undiminished; he welcomes the news that his son is a great warrior. I’ve often thought about which life I’d choose. My answer changes by the hour. All I know is that Achilles may have made a mistake, but it was his mistake. Choosing glory is what makes Achilles, Achilles. So long as the choice is honest, he chooses right.
Shouldn’t someone far above my pay grade be making these decisions? I’m inexperienced and I simply don’t know what is best in life. So I used the standards of others—chiefly those of the people I admire. I applied for the best of reasons, but they weren’t my reasons.
It’s easier to trust that your mentors have this whole life thing sorted out than it is to go out, make mistakes, and learn standards of your own. But all of us, even the wisest, most senior mentors, are just tall children in grownup clothing pretending we know what’s right. In the face of uncertainty, you must discover for yourself what is good. Your mentors won’t always be there.
If actions reveal character, if we choose our purpose in life, then turning down the Navy speaks poorly of my character. I took an oath. Those words have a hold on me. But to continue on would not be an action of my own. I say this not to disown my actions, but rather to take responsibility for having deceived myself and others. Ultimately, I’d rather admit my mistakes than perpetuate a lie.
I apologized to one of the board members who selected me to be an officer. He wrote back: “The mistake you are making is not believing in yourself.”
He was right. The character I tried to play was not believable. The actions didn’t match the motives. I take some life advice from Mel Brooks: “Life is a play. We’re unrehearsed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in March, a new directive issued by the Office of National Intelligence was quietly posted on its website. The directive, among other guidelines, prohibited officials within 17 different agencies from speaking to journalists about “unclassified intelligence-related topics” without permission, and additionally obligated “employees to report any unplanned contact with journalists.” It’s easy to see why the announcement was kept so low-key, as this is a large step toward increased secrecy under the Obama administration. While we respect the need for national security and safety, the recent directive also takes away from the freedom of the press and the public’s access to knowing about their own government.
While campaigning in 2008, Obama promised that his administration would be the most transparent in history. However, the government’s new directive is not the only event to have proved this statement wrong. The administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than all previous administrations combined, and last year the Justice Department was reported to have secretly obtained several months’ worth of telephone records from employees of the Associated Press in order to investigate how the press gathered their news, and from what sources. There is a fine line between safety and over-secrecy, inquiry and intrusion; agencies under the Obama administration have, in our opinion, crossed this line.
The right to freedom of the press was established to keep the people informed; and while the government reserves the ability to keep certain classified material from the public for our own safety, it is harmful to our very democracy when taken too far. There is a reason we go to news sources, not the government, to be informed. If the government were to dictate exactly what the press could and could not know, then this would defeat the purpose of news sources in the first place.
Intelligence officials might argue that the new directive would only make uniform rules that were already “generally” in place across several agencies. But what it does instead is build another wall between the government and the public, and make any employee’s interaction with journalists a possible reason to be fired or even prosecuted. It does not instill uniformity, but rather new punishments and restrictions for governmental agencies’ communications with the press.
We, The Crimson, believe in the right to an open, transparent government, such that journalists can do their job, and the public stays aware. The recent directive signed by the director of National Intelligence is one of several measures taken by the government to impede such values, and we hope that these actions are reconsidered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given that this is the final installment of two years of Dining on Sacred Cow, I ought to be butchering a big one this week. But all that’s genuinely worth flaying is too much to broadcast in a publication that will carry my name for the rest of my life—such is the world, and such is the reason why nobody ever takes profound risks on these pages; grant me that—and if you’d like to talk about dangerous things, we can do so more intimately.
Contrary to what I had wanted, this column has not become much of a shock generator. Despite my occasionally impish wish to upset people set in their ways, I strive painfully for nuance. I’ve talked about some quirky things, certainly—eating insects, fro-yo commerce, OKCupid/job application snafus, radical life extension—but it turns out that the real page turners are relatively boilerplate: affirmative action, the one percent, “the death of the humanities,” hook-up culture, drone strikes. On such issues, wrote Ecclesiastes, nothing is new under the sun. I would any day rather aim for unique value-add—a near impossibility when debating abortion, gun control, et al—than for outrage.
Fanatical open-mindedness to uncomfortable arguments is simply less common than I’d hoped it to be—a problem that holds as true at Harvard as anywhere else. When writers on these pages and on the public profiles of perfectly intelligent peers sincerely advocate for censorship of thought and speech, it is impossible to have a genuine conversation about anything unnerving—which is practically everything that matters.
If the reader rejects this mindset because it belongs to a privileged 21st century Westerner, then he or she is already missing the point. I am doing my sincere best to take account of my biases and privilege, recognize the contingency of my culturally and psychologically mediated perspective, and hear others out. At the very least, hear me out.
In the interest of broadening my perspective, I ask my discussants to share their most alarming ideas with me. In turn, I only ask never to be shut down on the mere basis of how challenging my suppositions can sometimes be. If my limited circumstances remain so irremediably unforgivable, then I suppose there is nothing meaningful to be shared.
The name of the game is open-mindedness—not the open-mindedness of pop mantras, but the radical, occasionally unsightly, always unafraid, universally critical, well-meaning, detective-like thing that finds no cow too sacred. In the broad sense, it is a dispositional trait that correlates with intelligence, skepticism, tolerance, tattoos (I will never get one, though), and Burning Man.
As I’ve argued before, it is a variable on which liberals are (on average) clinically proven to have conservatives beaten. But at the end of the day, it gets to their heads. Harvard is but one of many places teeming with liberals who congratulate themselves on their open-mindedness, astonishingly sure that their sensitivities and thought-taboos can’t be counted against it. Reality check: our mainstream liberal majority, perhaps more than any other ideological cohort around, lives extremely comfortable, small-C conservative lives of the mind.
The friend who suggested the title of this column puts it most succinctly: you are open-minded if you’re willing to seriously entertain and accept that the truth isn’t what you want it to be. As a born libertarian tempered by the reasonable takeaways of both Keynes and Burke (figuratively; I am more interested in psychology than in political philosophy), I do my best to believe in things first and foremost because I think them descriptively true, rather than simply desirable. If you ever notice a blind spot, I urge you to let me know.
If you expected me to spill all of my ugliest hypotheses about society and the human experience in this column, I’m sorry to have let you down. But the message remains what it has always been: no perspective or conjecture is too absurd or too dangerous. No cow is too sacred to be tipped.
Until incremental strides are made from all sides toward this leveling principle, social and political discourse will remain stunted, two-dimensional, and cringe-worthy. I hope everyone gets the help they need in surmounting the awful barriers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior year is a bookend, a fast deadline that guides growth like a trellis, a meridian that divides adolescence and adulthood. It’s a time perfectly appropriate for that morbid heaviness felt when contemplating life and death, one’s plans for life, or one’s lack of plans. Or when contemplating that there may be no perfect plans or right answers—even the best of runners cross the finish line spent and near collapse.
I don’t know if others feel this heaviness in the air but I believe that, as seniors, we begin to feel the burden of our future years sliding on our shoulders even as early as in August. I remember feeling the beginning of this pressure in that month, at the end of that month, when I heard that Seamus Heaney died.
I was on campus, working in the library, and read the news. I heard soon thereafter about a more-or-less impromptu memorial being conducted in the Woodberry Poetry Room. Recordings of Heaney’s own voice reading his poems played in the background; his books were pulled from the shelves, laid opened on the tables. A few people had gathered. I knew none of them. And the peculiar thing about Harvard, or really any elite institution, is that when strangers meet me, they ask not about me (at first) but ask whom I know.
Until a mutual connection comes to light, my status—and by extension the level of respect due me—is unknown. Often, it’s preferable to share a connection, even just a mutually disliked acquaintance, than to have none, to be a genuine stranger. I think this ‘guess-who-I-know’ game is pretty much ubiquitous—as is the experience of seeing someone you’ve newly met open himself up briefly, only to shut down. The discovery that you are not part of someone’s student group, or concentration, or club, often means you are not part of someone’s world.
Of course, this is not true of Freshman year. But it is true of Senior year, and is acutely felt by me because I have taken time off from Harvard and have seen near all my friends graduate already. I expect this to be true also for many who have likewise taken time off whether the reasons be academic, financial, or related to mental health.
I don’t mean to seem as though I’m careening off into an endless digression, though. In fact, I’m coming around to the main point which is that this heaviness I attributed to the psychic burden of adult responsibility is instead the burden of a forced parting, an exclusion. Graduation after eight semesters is in many ways arbitrary. The whole of the Senior class is required to go, to make room for the next bunch.
But how many of us are ready to go? Cases of famous drop-outs like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg should serve as examples that students are often ready to leave college behind before completing 8 semesters. Some of us are capable of find and holding down jobs; some of becoming captains of the innovation industry; yet some of us haven’t yet found jobs, discovered abilities or skills that make us valuable in a tough economy, or developed interests and talents that might give our lives meaning and direction.
I can’t count the number of meeting with OCS advisors, departmental advisors, and other administrators that dealt with course requirements, program deadlines, and other such logistical matters. Far too many meetings. But the number of meetings concerning what I want to do with my life? Far too few, and met mostly with shrugs, with little interest in my personal development.
Instead, I’ve been guided on a path of least resistance toward a degree that may or may not advance my career. I’ve been molded into another proto-alumnus and bombarded with requests to give my “senior gift” to Harvard. It’s a topic for another column—the unseemliness of Harvard’s begging—so I must regretfully leave the question to those who come after me.
I’ve had the feeling lately that really none of this matters much: heaviness, fear, outrage, graduation. When my senior year was again bookended by the death of another literary master (Gabriel García Márquez), I became obsessed again with “Cien Años de Soledad.” The ending: as Macondo dwindles out of memory, the town and the Buendía family are forgotten, swallowed by oblivion. Graduation is not different. The Harvard I have known will vanish, no matter what I’ve done or not. It’s a pessimism that makes it easier to digest the ending—of the book and of my student days.
I would be remiss to close without an offer of advice or of something positive to say. I’ve always liked books more than people; I think they stay with you longer, inhabit a deeper part of your brain. Read more. Don’t be afraid to. Read Heaney. Read something that no professor assigned you. Read for music and surprise. Read García Márquez. Prepare for the solitude that washes over you when you close the door to your last dorm room, dark and empty of any trace.

Roughly 82 percent of the 2,023 students admitted to the Class of 2018 have decided to matriculate—a figure that represents the College’s highest yield in 45 years. Due to the high rate of matriculation, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid expects to only admit around 15 to 20 students from the waitlist.
The Class of 2017’s yield rate was also close to 82 percent, even as the College had to cancel Visitas, its admitted students visiting weekend, in light of the manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombers.
Among those who committed to the Class of 2018, the Office of Admissions saw a record number of African American and Latino students—177 and 185—respectively. Three-hundred fifty-one Asian American students, the second highest number of students in College history, accepted offers of admissions. Twenty-seven students of Native American or Native Hawaiian descent decided to matriculate, as well. The totals mean that roughly 21 percent of the class will be Asian American, 10.5 percent African American, 11 percent Latino, and 1.5 percent Native American or Native Hawaiian.
The yield rate for African-American students went up by nearly 6 percent this year, to 73 percent, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. The yields for Latino and Native American or Pacific Islander applicants were about 70  and 71 percent, respectively. The Asian American yield was nearly 88 percent.
“We are very grateful to the many involved in the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program who worked toward these results throughout the year, and especially during the crucial month of April,” said Roger Banks, director of recruitment, in a statement.
According to Fitzsimmons, the gender breakdown of the matriculating class reflects that of the admitted pool, which was 55 percent male and 45 percent female.
He added that because 7.9 percent of students opted to mark their prospective concentration as undecided this year, it is hard to compare the concentration breakdown of the Class of 2018 to those of previous years. Despite this fact, Fitzsimmons said that the yield of those interested in different concentrations followed a trend that the Office of Admissions has seen in the past.
“It is always true that...there is a lower matriculation rate for people who are interested in computer science, and in engineering, and typically physical sciences,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that “there are higher yields on [prospective] social sciences, and humanities, and biological sciences [concentrators].”
After the Office of Admissions saw a nearly 60 percent increase in the number of applicants interested in computer science, 61 such students accepted officers of admissions compared to just 37 last year.
Fitzsimmons said that the implementation of online outreach tools and techniques that emerged during last year’s virtual Visitas helped bolster this year’s admitted students weekend, which ran from April 26-28, and contributed to another high yield.
“What we learned from previous years..is that undergraduates stepped forward and did an amazing job with social media and that helped us I think with a high yield last year. So we built on that and deployed it,” Fitzsimmons said.
In addition to online outreach, which included videos, presentations, and social media outreach, Fitzsimmons said that he observed a noticeable interest among current students to help with Visitas weekend.
“The way undergraduates this year volunteered to be hosts...was the most enthusiasm I have ever seen on the part of undergraduates,” Fitzsimmons said.
Fitzsimmons said that his office is already underway with reviewing those on the waitlist and hopes to send out notifications to some by the end of next week.
Only two other Ivy League institutions have recently reported yield rates to date.
A record-breaking 54.5 percent of those admitted to Dartmouth’s Class of 2018 are expected to matriculate. In light of this fact, Dartmouth administrators have said they do not plan to admit any students from  the school’s waitlist.
The University of Pennsylvania saw a 66 percent yield rate this year, a 3 percent increase from last year.

Mokha Origin, a new startup based at the Harvard Innovation Lab, has made strides to begin importing coffee beans from Yemen to encourage economic growth and stability on the Arabian Peninsula.
The startup, which has developed through the Venture Incubation Program at the i-lab, was one of ten finalist teams in the third annual President’s Challenge, a competition offering prize money to the best entrepreneurial ventures designed to bring about positive social change.
Mokha Origin lost its bid for the grand prize to VACU Scan, which won the President’s Challenge on Thursday evening. VACU Scan will use $70,000 in prize money to continue developing their smartphone-based prognostic test to assist in treating diabetic foot ulcers.
While the Mokha team did not win any prize money, co-founder Anda Greeney said he is proud of the work that he and the other team members have done. 
“If you buy this coffee, you’re going to help promote stability in Yemen,” said Michael Maxey, the USAID senior agriculture advisor for Yemen. Maxey, who first met with the Mokha Origin team in January, added that the drive for economic stabilization sets Mokha Origin apart from other speciality coffee brands.
Greeney said that Mokha Origin seeks to foster development through market mechanisms, which will hopefully reach a large population of Yemen’s small-scale coffee farmers.
“The Yemeni coffee industry is highly fragmented,” he said. According to Greeney, about 100,000 families produce about 115 kilograms of coffee each.
Mokha Origin uses local merchants to collect a relatively small amount from each farm, he added, tailoring their development strategy to the needs of Yemeni communities suffering from widespread poverty and malnutrition. Maxey noted that although local vendors offer plenty of food, families do not have enough money to buy it. 
By increasing both the profit and production of coffee farmers, Mokha Origin could indirectly increase families’ purchasing power, Maxey said.
Greeney noted that the i-lab’s events, mentors, and office space have been influential in developing the venture in its early stages.
The i-lab assigned Mokha Origin a mentor—Jonathan Rosenthal, executive director of Coop Coffees, which imports coffee from regions around the globe. Mokha Origin will partner with Rosenthal’s company to learn how to best move coffee beans to the U.S. from Yemen.
“Rather than learning by trial and error, they can build on the expertise we have,” Rosenthal said. “We give insight and assistance to figure out how to create a  social enterprise that meets their social and business goals.”
Mokha Origin has already begun selling its beans online and will introduce the product to Boston markets this year. Greeney hopes to have generated $100,000 in retail sales by the end of December. 
As Mokha Origin brings their product to American markets, Rosenthal will help them overcome import challenges, such as heightened security concerns and the lack of proper infrastructure.
The company also faces the challenge of ensuring the quality and purity of its coffee, Greeney said.
According to Greeney, local coffee merchants often illegally mix cheaper Ethiopian beans with more expensive Yemeni beans to lower costs. Mokha Origin, however, which sells exclusively Yemeni coffee, has spent $5,000 to make a database of Yemeni seeds that a research lab can use to identify contaminating strains of beans. 
Mokha Origin places such a high premium on the purity of the coffee they import because Yemen was the origin of coffee production worldwide.
Although many believe that coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia, Sufi monks created coffee in Yemen in the 15th century, Greeney said. In fact, Al Mokha was a port city in Yemen where coffee merchants first shipped coffee to Europe during the early 17th century, he added. The modern chocolate drink “mocha” derives its name from the port city as well, Greeney said, because Europeans often confused coffee beans and the South American cacao bean, which were introduced to Western Europe around the same time.
Rosenthal added that modern coffee consumers continue to have many misconceptions about the origins of coffee. 
“The global coffee market knows very little about Yemeni coffee,” Rosenthal said. Building brand loyalty through a comprehensive marketing strategy is key to overcoming this unfamiliarity, he added.
“Mokha Origin has gotten a lot of attention at Harvard, and their challenge is taking that excitement into the outer world beyond the University,” Rosenthal said. “I think they’re well-positioned to do that.”

In recent weeks, a team of Harvard IT staff members tasked by the Registrar’s Office to develop the Student Information System, a new online platform for course planning and registration slated to launch for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in the fall of 2015, has been meeting with students and faculty members to explain its vision for the system and gain feedback from future users.
According to Jason Shaffner, managing director for the Student Information Systems at Harvard, the team is working with administration, faculty, and students across the University to create the infrastructure and business model for the platform.
“We are pivoting to expand our outreach with students and faculty,” Shaffner said. “We are working on making sure the new system will meet their needs.”
The new system will integrate a number of applications—such as the study card, course planning tools, and the bill payment tool—from the website “my.harvard” into one online system designed to improve user experience and flexibility.
After launching in the FAS and the Divinity School in the fall of 2015, the SIS will roll out to the ten other Harvard schools.
Shaffner said he and those involved in the development of the SIS have focused on recruiting designers and constructing the underlying technological structure of the system since last May. Only this semester has the team begun its outreach campaign, and by next fall, its goal is to visit all of the undergraduate houses to present students with a model of the platform, which they will use to teach students about how the system will work.
“Then we might have something to show you instead of just words: ‘Here is  what access to your schedules might look like in the future, here is what the portal might look like,’” Shaffner said. 
According to Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee, Shaffner’s team met with his committee last week to present their plans for the project and seek feedback. Goyal said the UC will be working with the FAS’s Registrar’s Office and the implementation team to publicize the new system to undergraduate students.
“We are going to get them into dining halls, create some small task forces for different parts of the website,” Goyal said. “We are definitely going to bring the new ideas to the entire school.” 
The implementation team reports to an executive team, chaired by FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke and University Chief Information Officer Anne Margulies, that is responsible for ensuring that the team is following through with its objectives.
Burke said he expects that the student and faculty feedback will be important for designing the system’s tools when the team ramps up their outreach efforts next semester.
“We will be making a much bigger push in September and show some glimpses of what the future will look like,” Shaffner said.

Despite the relatively warm temperatures that graced the College for the last couple days, fewer people participated in Harvard’s semi-annual tradition Primal Scream on Thursday than in the fall term.
Primal Scream, a naked run around Harvard Yard that occurs each semester on the night before the first round of final exams, kicked off nearly after the stroke of midnight, when some students began their run around the yard. 
 
Though the event featured a band member who sprinted around the yard with his tuba, the spring festivities lacked much of the excitement last semester’s run, bystanders noted. The Scream typically attracts more runners in the fall than in the spring.
The band, true to tradition, played songs like “Ridin’ Dirty” near the steps of University Hall while waiting for the runners to start.
The runners, around 40 students total, gave out high-fives and waved to those who watched as they sped around the yard.
Some people who have participated in the event before also noted the differences between the fall and spring runs.
In fact, twenty or more tourists were standing on the stairs of University Hall with their cameras and iPads out before the screaming started.
“I feel pretty uncomfortable about the amount of tourists at this time,” said David J. Coletti ’17, who was around the yard while the run was happening. “I know one thing for sure though, they definitely got their money’s worth here.”

Of the eight at-large bids to the NCAA lacrosse tournament, the first seven went to traditional powerhouses Cornell, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Maryland, Syracuse, North Carolina, and Virginia. That left one spot remaining, with Hofstra and Harvard vying for the all-important opportunity.
The selection committee chose Harvard.
“There’s always some anxiety as you wait like that,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But you can tell how much these guys love lacrosse by how excited they were to keep playing lacrosse together for another week.”
No. 13 Harvard (10-6, 5-1 Ivy) will play No. 5 Notre Dame (9-5, 2-3 ACC), the automatic qualifier from the Atlantic Coast Conference, on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. in South Bend, Ind. The first-round contest can be viewed on ESPNU.
This season marks the first time that the Crimson has advanced to the NCAA Tournament since 2006, when the team lost to Syracuse in the first round.
Since the tournament’s inception in 1971, Harvard has made it just five times, never surviving past the quarterfinals.
Notre Dame comes into the matchup riding a three-game win streak, including impressive victories over second-seeded Syracuse and seventh-seeded Maryland.
But Harvard has also been hot as of late, as the Crimson has won five out of its last seven games, with the two losses both coming to fourth-seeded Penn.
Defense has been critical to Harvard’s success all season. In each of the team’s wins, the Crimson held its opponent to 10 goals or fewer.
Harvard even tends to slow the game down on the offensive end, setting up the attack and creating chances through team offense as opposed to individual efforts.
In its most recent loss, however, the Crimson held Penn to seven goals but only managed to score five. The setback in the Ivy League championship game was the first time all season that Harvard posted a shots-on-goal rate lower than 50 percent, as the 45.9 percent mark was well below the season average of 61.8 percent.
“We play as a team,” said defenseman and co-captain Joe Petrucci. “We are going to be ready to support our guys all over the field.”
Notre Dame, on the other hand, has won its last two games in shootouts, 15-14 over Syracuse and 18-17 over Army.
Much of the reason for the two high-scoring contests can be attributed to the Fighting Irish pushing the ball in transition, creating fast break opportunities for their offense and quick possessions.
“[Notre Dame] is excellent in transition and between the lines,” Wojcik said. “They generate offense that way and ride really hard on the other side, so we need to be very good in transition as well.”
The two styles will clash on Saturday, and the team that proves able to dictate the tempo of the game will likely come out on top.
One of the most important players for Harvard will be sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer. Between April 26 and May 2, Dwyer recorded 11 assists in just two games and was named first team All-Ivy.
But in the loss against Penn, Dwyer notched his lowest point total of the year, scoring only one goal with no assists.
If Harvard finds itself in a shootout with Notre Dame, as the effective quarterback of the offense, Dwyer will need to have a big day.
For the Fighting Irish, the offense revolves around attackmen sophomore Matt Kavanagh and junior Conor Doyle. Together, the duo has collectively notched 95 of Notre Dame’s 252 points this season. Doyle’s brother Jack also plays for the Fighting Irish after having transferred from Harvard this past season.
“[Kavanagh and Doyle] are both great players,” Wojcik said. “We are going to have to play great team defense and limit their ability to get to the goal. We will definitely need strong goaltending as well.”
The Notre Dame offense will face junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky, who has been solid in net recently for Harvard, recording save percentages over 50 percent in each of his last five games. His mark sits at 57 percent over that stretch, and he is 52 percent overall for the season.
One of the most interesting battles to watch will be at the faceoff, where senior Gabriel Mendola and freshman Austin Williams of Harvard will take on senior Liam O’Connor and junior Nick Ossello of Notre Dame.
O’Connor has won an impressive 58.9 percent of his faceoffs over the course of the season. While Mendola has won only 52 percent, the senior was victorious 68.1 percent of the time in conference play.
“We just hope that we can represent Harvard well,” Petrucci said. “This is our first time in the tournament in a long time. We have a lot to prove.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Ball by ball, over by over.”
The statement is the mantra of the Harvard club cricket team. It means to take the game a play at a time and to avoid brash decisions. It’s also the motto of team captain and founder Ibrahim Khan, one of the most important figures for the squad both on and off the field.
Despite his achievements, the senior from Lahore, Pakistan may not strike someone at first glance as a star cricket player who resurrected the Harvard program after two dormant decades.
“When you first see him, he looks kind of goofy,” team member Vivek Jayaram said. “He’s got long hair, a high school haircut. He’s always making a lot of jokes on the field, making fun of people…. He’s a very lighthearted person.”
Despite the laid back appearance, Khan has almost single-handedly built a program which just three years ago did not exist into a national powerhouse, all while maintaining a humble perspective on what has been an incredible journey.
THE PROPOSAL
It all started with a desire to play and fully discover the sport which Khan had grown to love from a young age. Despite playing recreationally throughout his youth in Pakistan, there still seemed to be a personal gap that Khan felt he needed fulfill.
“When I was very young, I had a bit of an injury,” Khan explained. “It was a minor injury, but my parents were always paranoid with the sport and thought if I played at a high level I’d get injured…. I had a sense I hadn’t really explored the sport to the ultimate.”
Just a year after forming the team as a recreational activity at Harvard, Khan took a big step forward by obtaining official club status for the team, allowing it to compete at a national level.
In order for the team to make further progress, however, a faculty adviser was necessary to back the club and provide support.
In came Professor Stephen Blyth, whose Statistics 123 class Khan was taking at the time.
After inviting Blyth to a Kirkland faculty dinner, Khan shared his vision and goals for the team.
Among those goals was making cricket a sport talked about on campus, competing at a high level, and winning a national championship within five years.
Khan’s vision and boldness impressed Blyth, who had played cricket at Harvard from 1989 to 1990.
“It never seemed like it would not [work] when he was talking to me,” Blyth said. “What was needed was someone to catalyze that, someone that’s charismatic, someone that’s got the energy, who can lead, and it never occurred to me that it would not be successful or well-run.”
Though having Blyth as a faculty adviser was a valuable boost for the team, the first year would provide challenges for the club and test Khan’s ability as a leader.
EARLY STRUGGLES
As the team’s head, Khan has dealt with various facets of the club both on and off the field. As a player, he captained the team while winning the respect of players who were older than him and had more experience playing at a high level.
Khan’s role was even more important off the field, as he managed the logistics of the team by organizing practices, competitions, and travel plans to make sure the team was ready to compete at the national level.
Among the biggest logistical challenges for young cricket teams is finding a venue in which to play and obtaining a sponsor. Under Khan’s initiative, the team secured Jordan Field to host matches and Hit Wicket Bar & Restaurant, a cricket-themed restaurant in Inman Square for a sponsor.
In addition, Khan and Blyth have been responsible for communicating with the Harvard Athletics Department as well as American College Cricket, the governing body for collegiate-level cricket, while simultaneously promoting the team.
“He’s been very active in getting publicity for the club,” Blyth said. “We’ve been able to get a story in the Gazette, the Harvard Magazine, the [Boston] Globe. We held a reception with the British Consul General at the Faculty Club…. [It was] something that’s bringing a little bit of momentum to his efforts of articulating what he’s trying to do.”
Arguably the biggest challenge, and by far the most frustrating for Khan, however, was getting club members to commit to matches.
“When we were starting, the most frustrating occasions would be when people like the sport, but at the end of the day, it’s not their number one priority,” Khan said. “We’d have times where we would have the game set up but we had difficulty putting out 11 players.”
This struggle to form a cohesive unit continued throughout the season. Yet Khan maintained positivity due to his love for the game, and the team became closer as the year progressed.
The point which really brought the team together in Khan’s mind and defined its dedication was its trip to nationals in Fort Lauderdale, Fl. last March.
At one point, the team only had five players who were committed to traveling south to represent Harvard. But Khan was able to pull together a full squad of 11 to make the trek.
“The team rented a car and drove down overnight for 26 hours to get to Florida,” Khan said. “That is commitment…. After that, the guys who went to nationals stuck with team and are still on the team, [and that] was really a turning point.”
AN OLD RIVAL LIGHTS A SPARK
In October 2012, the cricket club earned a feature headline in the Boston Globe after defeating Yale, 249-74.
The story noted that the match was the result of a challenge Khan’s predecessors had issued via The Harvard Crimson in 1887. Yale had finally responded 124 years later.
Among the players highlighted by the Globe was Khan. The recognition helped the college student grow not only as a leader, but also as a player.
“His performances up until that point were good but modest. But since then, he’s had some big performances,” Blyth said. “It’s interesting because the catalyst [was] the publicity, and it’s led to some really strong performances, winning a number of awards.”
The high-level cricket which developed as a result of this renewed focus on Khan’s play led to an outstanding senior season for the captain.
Khan took home various awards throughout the year, highlighted by his American College Cricket Player of the Year award in only his second true year of competitive cricket. He also was named ACC Tournament Player of the Year, ACC regular season MVP, and the Harvard Male Club Athlete of the Year.
His awards were indeed well-earned, as Khan led the ACC in both batting—by over 100 goals—and bowling for the year.
Aside from the renewed focus, Khan attributes his success on the field to a new realization he made while developing his game.
“I was naturally apprehensive because I feared getting out,” Khan said. “That changed when in our first game at nationals, we didn’t have anything to lose, and I went up to bat. I went all guns blazing, and I made a good score at a quick pace…. When I stopped thinking of the inhibitions, I’m a much better player.”
Khan’s performance helped Harvard win the ACC regular season championship.
At the national tournament, Harvard went 1-2 in pod play, an improvement from its winless showing in the previous year.  A close loss to runner-up Auburn denied Harvard’s aspiration of taking home both the regular season and postseason title in Khan’s final season with the team.
SAYING GOODBYE
While the Harvard cricket team looks like it will continue to prosper going forward, next year marks the first year in its youthful resurrected form that it will not be led by Khan, who plans to move to New York at the end of the school year.
Looking back on his time at Harvard, Khan expressed his honest surprise of the success that the team has experienced.
“To tell you the truth, the amount of success that we’ve gotten, I’m pleasantly surprised by it and very proud of it,” Khan said. “The amount of support we’ve gotten…it’s been a surprise in a pleasing way for me.”
While Harvard cricket will learn to move on in a new direction without Khan, the presence and impact he has left on the team will no doubt continue to influence the team, starting with his mantra.
“He was always the heart and soul of the Harvard cricket club,” Jayaram said. “Ibrahim was Harvard cricket. He’ll be remembered as the founder…. Without him we wouldn’t be here…. His lasting impact will always be ‘ball by ball, over by over.’ It’s our motto, it’s our spirit, it’s the way we approach the game, [and] it’s our strategy. And that’s Ibrahim.”
