A recent article in  the Columbia Daily Spectator reveals the real empire state of mind: cash-starved.
Columbia University's 2009 financial statement notes that the school has  racked up a total of $1.39 billion in debt—a level that could imperil the University's AAA credit rating if it climbs much higher, according to Columbia President Lee Bollinger.
The AAA rating is the highest given by external credit rating agencies. It denotes a very low risk of credit  default and means selling debt is cheaper for institutions considered financially sound.
But it's not only about the bills. It's also a matter  of pride. Columbia economics professor Sally Davidson is quoted in the  article as saying, “In addition, Columbia’s peers—Harvard, Princeton,  Yale, Stanford, MIT all have AAA ratings—does Columbia want to drop  below this group? Probably not.”
Damn straight, Harvard’s  got a AAA credit rating. And we're champs in the debt department  with a bitchin’ $6 billion! Wait…that isn’t something to be  proud of? Oops.

How can Columbia make  some bank? Personal experience suggests nixing hot breakfast, or developing  a nifty line of golf-course-friendly clothing.

And there’s always  the follow-the-advice-of-a-fictional-movie route. We can think of a  couple of entrepreneurial professors from Columbia who escaped from  debt to make millions and a very catchy theme song. Their success  was conditional on the existence of ghosts, and that endowment’s looking  eerily spectral right about now isn’t it, Columbia? Unfortunately,  we’re betting that’s a problem that even Mel Gibson couldn’t  fix…
