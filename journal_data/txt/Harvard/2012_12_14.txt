After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the Computer Science 50 and Science of Cooking Fairs, the Harvard undergraduate body (in the most literal sense) participated in a multi-dimensional, public exposé this Wednesday, the annual Anatomical Science Fair, or what some refer to as Primal Scream. The students showed their overwhelming support for the biological sciences and the theory of evolution by symbolically and collectively devolving into a naked group of bodies, running around the Yard in 30-degree weather like a pack of Brazilian Spider Monkeys.
Not really. In fact, there’s nothing scientific, primal, or monkey-related about it—besides all the bananas. For the past week, I’ve heard my professors and friends say Primal Scream is a detrimental and patriarchal sausage-fest where a bunch of drunk kids expose themselves and expose how susceptible they are to peer pressure in the process. It has no point. No community outreach. No advancement of learning. No tangible benefit can come from risking health and pride by streaking through the Yard before finals week. That makes it sort of a unique event at Harvard—there’s not a single good reason to do it.
And that’s exactly why Harvard students should do it.
It seems like everything at Harvard has a point, excepting the construction outside the Science Center. All the buildings have labs and classes so students can get A’s and make a lot of money. The clubs have productive events so students can pad their resumes and make a lot of money.  Even the statue of the founder, one of the most useless objects on any college campus, often serves as a useful meeting place and photo studio, among other things.
It all combines to make a fast-paced and exciting college environment for some of the smartest students in the world to follow their passions and compete against one another. Most Harvard students have a drive to succeed and look smart among their peers. But after a long semester of all-nighters and freak-outs, the debilitating pressure can take a toll.
So, it’s nice that right before finals, right before the driven students of Harvard have to face the institutionally mandated measure of their scholastic success over the long semester, they act like idiots. They go against every one of their studious and social Harvard instincts and just exist for a few moments in a purely physical way—a way that everyone can see. The only thing primal scream can add to our resumes is a few embarrassing photos. The only thing it can add to our studies is a better understanding of Freud’s theories. It has no point whatsoever. And that makes it liberating.
For me, taking the plunge into the naked night was a big step. Nudity is not one of my strong suits. The closest I usually come to being naked is in the shower, and even then I wear a full wetsuit and water weenies. I was nervous, a little scared even. But somehow, I found the stupidity (in my case it wasn’t that hard) to walk out of Grays with my friends into the cold Cambridge night with only a layer of polyester-cotton towel separating me from everything else.
The night air sent a chill down my spine as I ran to the crowd gathering outside of Hollis. I squeezed my way in amongst the bodies and felt the warmth of their excitement. A chant was thrown into the air— “USA! USA!” —and then the countdown came: “Eight…seven…six…five…why did I sign up for this?… four…I didn’t sign up for this…three…oh well…two…here we go…one…” The clock struck midnight. My towel flew open. I ran. I screamed.
I saw friends lining the pavement, cheering me on. I saw the band playing fight songs. I saw the Yard, the country’s great symbol of scholastic prestige and old, honorable times, filled with a thousand butts. For a few cold, embarrassing, miserable, and great moments, finals and the worries associated with them seemed like light-years away. After a first semester in college spent pushing my every intellectual and personal ability to try to stand out among a class of incredibly talented and passionate kids, I felt like an idiot. And it felt great.
So, I encourage Harvard students not to overanalyze primal scream. It’s not a patriarchal sausage-fest. It’s not a peer-pressure forum. It’s not a masochistic test of tolerance for embarrassment.
It’s just stupid—no ifs, ands, or…well…

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Harvard Professor Robert C. Darnton ’60 described what he viewed as a remarkable and widespread belief in China today: According to a list that has been circulated widely on the internet in China and published in book form, Harvard’s libraries contain 20 inspirational sayings and fearsome injunctions written on their walls. The list includes exhortations to study hard, promising rewards including great wealth, happy matrimony, and all-purpose “success,” including, “Please enjoy the unavoidable suffering."
I missed that one the last time I walked into Widener.
Yet these last moments of the semester—when the rustling of hundreds of sheets of notebook paper echoes through Loker Reading Room, when Lamont seems busier at 2 a.m. than 2 p.m.—produce precisely the environment that this Chinese myth imagines. Harvard students may not “enjoy” the “suffering,” but we certainly can’t avoid it. But why does it strike us as so totally preposterous that our libraries would feature these exhortations on their walls?
When I spoke with Darnton, he gave one possible answer to this first question. “The Chinese are attributing to us a style of discourse that exists in China,” he noted, mentioning Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book as an example. Harvard, on the other hand, does not appear to engage in this kind of discourse.
“The University doesn't sponsor an official set of allocutions or exhortations to behave in a certain way and to respect certain principles,” Darnton said. “Even in the welcoming speeches by the president, there isn't a lot of formulating principles for guiding students through life like these supposed allocutions. We just don't go in for that.”
Harvard does have examples of quotations written onto its walls. Emerson Hall, which houses the philosophy department, includes a line from Psalm 8, spoken to God: “What is man that thou art mindful of him?” These humbling words, set in stone in 1900, seem exceptional because they are, to Darnton, “almost the polar opposite” of the orientation of humanistic studies today, where “man is everything.”
Of course, even if most students don’t think about the words on Emerson as they walk through the Sever Quadrangle, the Old Testament quotation isn’t going to be replaced with “please enjoy the unavoidable suffering” anytime soon. The Chinese exhortations may seem impossible to us, but perhaps that feeling comes more from our sense of frustration with—and rejection of—the values that they endorse rather than a sense that we don’t want our walls to tell us what to do.
Darnton, who arrived at Harvard in 2007, said that he was initially struck “by the importance of money everywhere—in the minds of students, even first-rate students, and even the faculty,” as well as the consequent fact that students “pour into Wall Street.” This prioritization falls into a broader phenomenon of what Darnton describes as “implicit messages about how to behave that permeate the campus.” Indeed, in the experience of students that I interviewed for this column, these “implicit messages” include especially the idea that a career decision must be a choice between following one’s passion and pursuing a big paycheck.
However, throughout this semester, I have tried to draw attention to the original and exciting ways that students are finding to break down the passion-versus-paycheck mentality and imagine new career paths. This group includes students with literary interests who are helping to create the field of digital media and students with interests in China who are pushing the boundaries of what a country-specific career can entail.
These students are working hard, but they do not simply view their time at Harvard or their post-college career choices as needing to involve “unavoidable suffering.” They have heard the unsatisfying “implicit messages” that “permeate the campus” and responded with action and innovation.
Most broadly, then, these imaginary exhortations can serve one valuable purpose at Harvard: to begin conversations about our values and our priorities. As we react to what they reveal about what people in China think Harvard is telling us, they also offer us an opportunity to reflect—on what Harvard is (and isn’t) actually encouraging us to do, on what values underlie our experience of Harvard, and on what informs our decision-making about life after college.
As a result, we will be even more “mindful” as we consider the biggest questions in our lives—and, we hope, find even better answers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two weeks, the World Conference on International Telecommunications has met with the stated purpose of reviewing the operation and efficiency of telecommunications around the world. Although the intention of the conference was to discuss global telecommunication standards, several countries have attempted to shift the focus of this meeting to issues of internet regulation. Last year, a team of countries led by China and Russia submitted a proposal requesting the establishment of an international security code to monitor internet behavior. Recently, Russia reemphasized its desire for international control of the internet by requesting that the conference examine the issue of internet oversight. While the United States staunchly opposed any discussion of the internet at this communications conference, this disagreement raised the question of both domestic and international internet regulations.
Despite the calls for tighter restrictions from autocratically inclined regimes like China and Russia, there is no cause for global regulation of the internet. Rather, it is high time for an international commitment to freedom on the Internet.
Since its establishment as a tool for quick, easy access to information, the internet has been subject to international cries for regulation. In a prior United Nations telecommunications conference, Iran and Cuba demanded reforms to cut down freedoms and increase management of the internet. While a few countries continue to call for increased regulation of this vast network of free thought and information, the international community should not acquiesce to the demands of a vocal minority. Rather than increase information regulations, the global community should not only remain committed to a free and open internet, but also help develop the framework for greater freedom of information.
Although many countries enjoy substantial freedom on the internet, some states go to extensive efforts to inhibit access to information. In China, the government routinely checks incoming web traffic and prevents any anti-government sentiments from being broadcast online, blocking Facebook, Twitter, and Google in an attempt to prevent the spread of information. Citizens of Iran face similar restrictions, as the population is forced to use a purely domestic internet system that prohibits the use of Google. Rather than adopt globalized standards of internet regulation, the international community should attempt to facilitate the spread of information to states such as China and Iran. By preventing the spread of information in these states, governments not only deprive their citizens of information, but they also inhibit the ability of journalists to uncover and distribute information.
When the state censors all incoming and outgoing information, it becomes nearly impossible for the public to accurately gauge their relative quality of life, restriction on freedoms, or potential for improvement. Indeed, preventing the flow of this information appears to be the reason why autocratic regimes desire to control the internet. The international community must take measures not to establish a global framework of internet regulation, opting instead for a worldwide initiative for internet freedom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are many lamentable aspects of the recently concluded presidential campaign, ranging from negative advertising to the flow of cash from unnamed donors to Super PACs. Yet another, subtler issue in this election underscored a lingering problem in American politics. The 2012 campaign marked yet another year in which both parties perpetuated the damaging fallacy of American exceptionalism.
American exceptionalism has been around as long as the country itself. In the early days of the United States, the young democracy was genuinely the exception to most of its contemporaneous regimes. America’s “democratic experiment” separated this country from its European counterparts, and the success of American capitalism gave Americans reason to be proud of their country. The phrase “American exceptionalism” was soon taken up by politicians to make a variety of claims about the special nature of the United States. But as Richard Cohen argues in the Washington Post, today’s exceptionalism is a sort of super-patriotism, a radically pro-American stance in which any acknowledgement of error on the part of the U.S. government is seen as heresy.
In the final presidential debate of 2012, Mitt Romney confronted the president over what he termed Obama’s “apology tour” of the Middle East shortly after he took office.  Romney said that the official foreign visits consisted of “going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.”  This was quite an exaggeration on Romney’s part, as Obama’s rhetoric was not radically different from that of the Bush administration.  Furthermore, we have to ask why the statement that Obama had “criticized America” was immediately seen as an attack.
In modern American foreign policy, self-criticism is viewed as an unacceptable sign of weakness rather than a constructive sign of learning. Surely no reasonable observer would suggest that American foreign policy toward the Middle East has been uniformly laudable. It would be dishonest to deny that we have made mistakes. Why, then, is it considered weak for Obama to accept and acknowledge America’s past faults?
Essentially, Romney was advocating that our foreign policy take a leaf out of the playground bully’s book: We should not admit our mistakes, and, when challenged about our errors, we should lash out harder against those who expose them. There is nothing strong about this policy. In fact, it demonstrates insecurity and even immaturity.
As Romney frequently reminded voters during the campaign, he was a successful businessman before turning to elected office. Surely, Romney did not strike deals for Bain Capital by refusing to negotiate or admit any weakness on his own part. Anyone who has tried to reach an agreement on an important issue will know that little progress can be made without each side receiving some concessions from the other.
Historically, the only way that agreements have been reached without compromise is in war, when one side can literally beat the other into submission. Perhaps this is the strategy that Romney and the Republican Party would like to pursue—after all, who needs to speak softly when you can use a big stick? But the GOP must recognize that diplomatic solutions cannot move forward if America is unwilling to be honest about its own faults with itself and the countries it negotiates with.
I do recognize that there are instances in which compromise may not be advantageous. As George W. Bush frequently reminded us, America does not negotiate with terrorists. This is not an unreasonable policy; it establishes a doctrine that can be universally applied and could be advantageous in the long-term. A principle of “America does not negotiate with foreign governments,” however, can hardly be applied universally.
American exceptionalism also perpetuates negative stereotypes about the U.S. in foreign countries. It is premised not just on the idea that America is exceptional, but that America is exceptionally good. Exceptionalists do not believe that America has exceptional potential, but that it already has exceptional accomplishments. This brash self-confidence can lend an appearance of strength, but in reality it is nothing more than self-delusion. Other countries apply a more sober approach to domestic problems and take note when America fails to do so.  In the face of failed wars in the Middle East and a painful economic recession at home, pretending that America is without fault does not help advance solutions to our country’s problems. Our collective inability to objectively assess and deal with our own issues is a political embarrassment.
Ironically, over-patriotic exceptionalists are, as a group, relatively unique to America. Their existence alone makes America exceptional in a certain way. The uniformly positive views they wish to project about our country, however, could not be farther from reality. The exceptionalist opinion that America should never admit failure, never show weakness, and never give an inch breaks down negotiation processes and worsens our national image. American politicians would do well to abandon the delusion of exceptionalism in favor of an honest, pragmatic approach to political negotiation and problem solving.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part III of a three-part series on mental health at Harvard. Part I was published on Dec. 10, and Part II on Dec. 12.
When Harvard University President Drew G. Faust sat down with students in the intimate Kirkland House Junior Common Room in mid-October, much of the talk centered on her book on the Civil War and her recent appearance on “The Colbert Report.” But one student stood up to ask a more serious question.
Trevor N. Coyle ’14 said that he had heard of long delays in care at University Health Services’ overtaxed mental health clinic. He said that those in need of help might never seek that medical attention because as Harvard students, “they feel like they’re too strong” to admit a mental health problem. And he alluded to the three student deaths this year alone, and a suicide rate at Harvard College that is two or more times higher than the national college average.
“Given some recent events,” he said, “I guess I’m interested in seeing whether you think the University should take a preventative measure in terms of mental health.”
Faust responded, “This is a very stressful place.... It is something that is very much on our minds.”
This year marked by three tragedies has also seen an uptick in efforts by students and administrators to take on the issue of mental wellbeing at Harvard. On panels and online forums, in email and in person, students and administrators are working to identify ways to provide students with the mental health support they need.
UNDER INVESTIGATION
Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds echoed Faust’s diagnosis of Harvard’s stressful culture in an interview in mid-November.
“It’s something that permeates the air here,” Hammonds said. “People are always stressed out, and I don’t think that’s a good thing.”
Earlier this semester, Hammonds launched a committee to examine the issue. The Workgroup on Student Stress, headed by UHS director Paul J. Barreira and Adams House master Judith S. Palfrey ’67, will consider whether the University is providing enough support for students, according to Hammonds.
“What do you do when you get stressed out? Where do you go? What kinds of things do you do to keep yourself well? What sorts of wellness programs do we need to have?” she says, listing questions the group will probe.
The committee will report back to Hammonds in the spring with recommendations for improving campus culture.
While the working group studies the issue, some students are taking matters into their own hands now rather than waiting for administrators’ opinions.
LEAN ON ME
Smile beaming from her face, Arleen B. Aguasvivas ’15 seems out of place as she navigates the Kirkland dining hall. With paper deadlines and final exams nearing, the rest of the 10 p.m. crowd is buried in textbooks or tapping away at their laptops.
But she is not here to study. Armed with lollipops, earplugs, and colorful notes with uplifting messages, this student mental health liaison has come to engage students in non-academic conversations, if even for a moment.
“I really enjoy it,” she says. “I love seeing their reactions. They are all eyebrows furrowed, but then they smile, and it’s truly nice.”
This mobile study break, as Aguasvivas describes it, is just one initiative SMHL puts on during high-pressure testing periods. Founded in 2008 by Barreira, then the director of behavioral health and academic counseling for UHS, SMHL aims to educate students about mental health resources at Harvard.
The group sponsors depression screenings in dining halls, guest speakers, and occasional free massages. This year, SMHL introduced mandatory freshman workshops which present real Harvard students’ stories about the stresses of life at Harvard and run through the mental health resources available to undergraduates.
In the spring, SMHL plans to launch a video, with funding from the College and the help of a professional videographer, based on the popular LGBT-focused “It Gets Better” series.“
The college environment is a tough place. We want students to know that people have struggled and sought help and gotten better, and that that is a normal route,” says SMHL co-president Seth H. Cassel ’13.
Cassel credits Harvard’s peer counseling groups, like Room 13, Response, and Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, with providing most of the daily one-on-one support for students.
“There is this whole peer counseling community that is fantastic,” he says. “And honestly, they’re an underutilized resource.”
Alexa, who suffers from bipolar disorder, says that Harvard programs outside of UHS have frequently helped her. “I have found Harvard to be an extraordinarily nurturing environment,” she says.
Mackenzie, who has battled PTSD and depression, credits the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies community for supporting her socially during her time at Harvard.
“People in the LGBT community have struggled with these issues,” she says. “It’s been important to have those conversations in a safe space.”
DEPRESSION CONFIDENTIAL
“I don’t even want to be a doctor anymore...but I don’t have that luxury because I am poor, a minority, female, and first generation,” one anonymous Harvard student confides over Tumblr. “I’m at Harvard—that should be good enough, right? Well, I don’t feel good enough. I feel like I should go to UHS right now to prevent myself from failing 2 of my classes with assignments due in a few hours, but I don’t even have the energy to get out of my room.”
Another writes of having no real friends at Harvard. “I want to have a kind of friendship where it’s more than a few meals and just a group get-together once a month or so. But at the same time, I’m so tired of putting in any effort into my relationships,” the writer shares.
One student currently on a semester abroad posts, “I’m going through the same patterns of stress, depression, self-loathing as before and feel even more pressure to succeed here. My professors, classmates, and host family know I am from Harvard, and everyone knows Harvard, but when the Harvard kid is falling apart mentally and other students are not, it makes people wonder if that student is really from Harvard.”
The posts are part of an online mental health awareness campaign launched last month by the Harvard Foundation, Harvard College Women’s Center, and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. The anonymous Tumblr, called Mental Health Matters, allows students to share their experience with mental illness and recommends on-campus resources and events.
The blog is just one of several initiatives this semester aimed at spurring discussion on mental health. In November, SMHL hosted a panel in which four Harvard undergraduates—none of whom were interviewed for this series—told the stories of their suicide attempts. The month before, the spoken word group Speak Out Loud invited students to share their experience with mental illness through spoken word, interpretive dance, and candid conversations. Emotions ran high as students reflected on every kind of loss—from that of a friend to suicide to that of a daughter’s relationships with her father after coming out as a lesbian.
Mackenzie felt the open mic night was one of the most important mental health events of the year. “These are the conversations that haven’t happened on campus,” she says.
WISDOM FROM SURVIVORS
Alexa feels strongly that such conversations are the only way to reduce the stigma of mental illness at Harvard.
“Most of us will be suffering with this to some degree,” she says. “The biggest danger is not talking about it. For those who are sufferers, it is isolating. For those who might be sufferers, it limits information, and it’s isolating. And for people who are unaffected, it maintains a mystique that is not healthy.”
She encourages sufferers to do the most difficult, and crucial, thing—say something.
“There are people available for us,” she says. “It’s so important to find someone trusting. People are not out there to sabotage you. People are there to be helpful.”
Mackenzie too emphasizes the importance of not going it alone. “If you reach out to people, they will understand. They may not understand completely, but they will be sympathetic,” she says.
Looking back at her suicide attempts, Christine recognizes that her story—now one of recovery—could have turned out differently. Today there are still days she takes hours to pray through her despair, but with a mind free from suicidal thoughts, she celebrates her progress toward mental health.
“I would encourage people to embrace the reality of universal brokenness,” she says. “Embrace the reality that no one is perfect. It is easy to get tripped up at Harvard because it appears that everyone else is perfect. Remember that everyone falls short of perfection.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peter A. Boyce ’13 and Zachary M. Hamed ’14 officially launched a partnership to invest in student tech entrepreneurs Thursday. The organization, named Rough Draft Ventures, will invest $5,000 to $25,000 in student tech projects in Boston, according to its website.
“My goal at the end of the day is to help students launch cool stuff,” said Boyce, who said he conceived the idea at the beginning of this year. “What I wanted to see was something that was flexible and fast, and would provide student startups with accessible funding, mentors, and feedback.”
Boyce said that the group, which he and Hamed co-founded with students from five other Boston colleges, has lined up ten mentors in the Boston area already, including Matt Lauzon, founder of a Boston-based jewelry startup Gemvara. Many of the mentors will attend Harvard’s Hack Week to provide guidance to participants, Boyce said.
General Catalyst, a venture capital firm that specializes in early stage investments, has committed to backing Rough Draft Ventures financially.
“General Catalyst has been super invaluable in giving us an uncapped note for setting this up,” Boyce said.
The new organization is not the first group devoted to funding student entrepreneurship at Harvard. This past January, a group of Harvard affiliates launched the Experiment Fund, a venture capital fund that targets student startups.
Boyce sought to distinguish Rough Draft Ventures from the Experiment Fund, citing the difference in investment size. The Experiment Fund invests six figure sums in a few projects every year, while Rough Draft Ventures aims to be broader in scope, Boyce said.
“The difference between us and the Experiment Fund is that they lack the student perspective,” Boyce said. “They are doing larger investments. I’m much more excited about helping students that have no idea what’s going on and just want to get their ideas off the ground.”
The financing provided by Rough Draft Ventures will come in the form of loans with no cap on potential funding levels. The group will not provide funds beyond the initial investment, but will help students locate new investment sources.
“At the end of the day, there should be a very quick process to let students know whether what they are working on is worth investing in,” said Boyce. “Students have got to know there is a funding source out there for them. Have amazing students start amazing things. Period.”

A new study authored in part by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health claims that while people worldwide are living longer, they are living more of those years in poor health.
This week, contributors to the Global Burden of Disease project published new findings in the medical journal The Lancet that they say reveal key changes in the way people worldwide are living with and treating major health problems.
Joshua Salomon ’93, a professor of global health at HSPH who contributed to the study, said that he and other project researchers found that short lifespans are more frequently a product of chronic diseases than of infectious diseases or nutritional deficiencies.
“People are dying from adult diseases more than they are from diseases that kill children,” Salomon said.
According to Salomon, the study is the most comprehensive survey that has been conducted on current trends in global health. As part of the project, researchers distributed a survey that asked questions about the severity of 291 different diseases and injuries. The survey, developed with input from researchers from over 50 countries and distributed mainly online, received responses from over 160 countries and over 30,000 people worldwide.
After collecting their data, project researchers sought to develop tools to measure the impact of certain diseases on quality of life and life expectancy. Mohsen Naghavi, an associate professor of global health at the University of Washington, has worked on improving the quality, distribution, and presentation of the data that has been collected. Naghavi emphasized the importance of taking new approaches to studying diseases over time.
He said that much has changed about the field since 1990, when the first Global Burden of Disease results were released, to the next updated release of statistics in 2004, and again this year with data gathered in 2010.
Although life expectancy in most regions has increased by an average of about ten years since 1990, Salomon said he thinks that countries will have to consider the economic strain created by their rapidly aging populations. According to Salomon, the health issues most threatening today are not nutrition deficiency or infectious diseases, but non-communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and cancer.
While Salomon said it is important to raise awareness of these issues, he warned against taking coordinated political action in response to the global trends identified in the report. He said that policymakers in every country will have to consider the areas of disease that are most serious to develop viable and affordable regional solutions.
“The results are not a direct prescription for policy,” Salomon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some wore ski masks, others hard hats, a few Viking helmets, but almost none wore clothing at this year’s annual Primal Scream. Well over a hundred students lined up in front of Stoughton and Hollis Halls to count down the seconds to midnight before running a wild lap across the Yard early Thursday morning.
A large crowd composed of students from across the College attended this semester’s iteration of the Harvard tradition, which has included streaking since the 1990s.
Before the run began, runners chanted U-S-A, waved class banners, and a few scrawled letters like XC across their buttocks. During the run, at least one runner ended up covered in milk, though most simply screamed and sprinted in the thirty-two degree weather.
Runners told The Crimson they had attended for a variety of reasons. Some said it was a release from the stress of finals.
“Just gotta do something fun,” said Robert B. Fluegge ’16, who also said he was “stressed out with all the studying.”
Others were less precise in their reasoning.
“It’s really just kind of an impromptu thing,” said Jacob M. Colbath-Hess ’16. “My roommates were like, let’s do it.”
More than 100 spectators gathered to observe. Before the event, the Harvard University Band played hits such as “Centerfold” at the John Harvard statue to rile up the crowd. Many of the band members themselves only sported short shorts beneath their jackets, although such attire was far more substantial than that worn by the runners themselves.
Not everyone who attended the event was caught up in its spirit. One megaphone-wielding spectator shouted at the assembled crowd: “To all you fat girls who feel liberal: this is fucking disgusting.”
Jacob J. Hutt ’13, who ran in the event, sported a large Where The Wild Things Are headpiece while running.
“I felt like for my first time, I had to go all out,” explained Hutt, who said the event was everything he dreamed of and more.
Others said they agreed. “It was really fun,” said Fluegge, adding that he would probably do it again.
Hutt said he was not so certain. “Once in a lifetime is enough,” he said.
Participation in the event was not limited to undergraduates. One Kennedy School student, who asked not to be identified by name because of the nature of the event, claimed to have run naked at every school he has attended.
“I’d like to see some more integration,” he said, adding that he thought it was a shame that Harvard’s graduate students did not interact more with students at the College.
The spectacle did not last long. A few students ran multiple laps, and one inebriated runner attempted to drag a “Please Walk Your Bike” sign home, but the Yard largely emptied after twenty minutes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From producing the fashion show Eleganza to promoting high fashion through the Vestis Council, Harvard students have proven that they know how to rock the world of style and couture. Three student fashion startups strive to combine students’ love of style with a desire to give back to their community.
SHOPRAGHOUSE
Inspired by the belief that fashion should be accessible to all, Harvard Law School graduates Joana Florez and Bridgette L. Hylton launched their fashion business ShopRagHouse this summer. The business partners want to allow insider access to the fashion world by allowing users to submit their original clothing designs.
“ShopRagHouse is for the everyday fashion enthusiast who believes that they have something to contribute to the conversation around fashion,” said Hylton.
By opening the design floor to fledgling fashionistas, even those who don’t have a background in art or fashion, Florez and Hylton hope to make fashion more inclusive.
“Companies are being forced to be more responsive to the consumer market,” Hylton said.
The resulting start-up is an online platform that allows users to vote on the submitted designs, and the most popular sketches are transformed into samples available for purchase through the website. The designers of the winning sketches receive a 20 percent cut of the profits made from sales of their designs.
The ShopRagHouse website, which went live this fall, already has about 200 members. Over 30 designs have been submitted by users, and ShopRagHouse recently produced its first sample based on a design created by Florez and Hylton.
The duo highlighted the importance of technology as a means of conducting business.
“We really believe that tech-space is the future of retail,” said Hylton.
Using an online platform, ShopRagHouse plans to reach people all over the world. A recently submitted design came from a user based in Italy.
The two founders cite their experience at HLS, and their professors, as factors that encouraged them to found their own business.
“From the first day of law school, they were constantly encouraging people to go out into the world and think outside the box,” Florez said.
“It’s not just an in-class experience,” Hylton agreed. “The community itself breeds innovation.”
In the future, the HLS graduates would like to provide mentorship for emerging designers.
“We’ve learned so much in the couple of months that we’ve been working on [ShopRagHouse], and we think that we’d be able to offer them a lot of insight into the fashion industry,” Florez said.
VALTI
Valti—a business that allows women to rent dresses from one another for formal events—started as a CS50 final project last fall.
“At the [CS50] fair there was interest from a lot of people so I thought, hey, maybe I’ll continue this after class and see how it goes,” founder Laura A. Evans ’13 said.
Working with Ethan P. Barhydt ’14, she submitted the business plan to the I3 challenge after last winter break, ended up being a finalist, and was granted advising resources that allowed her to advance her business. After working on it over the summer at the Harvard I-lab and the HSA innovation space, Evans, Barhydt, and two others launched the business this fall.
All the dresses that are being rented out on Valti are stored in a vault at HSA cleaners, with which Valti has a partnership. This makes it easier for women to pick the dresses up and ensures that each dress is dry-cleaned upon its return, Evans said.
Evans was inspired to create Valti when she transferred to Harvard from UC Berkeley and was overwhelmed with “an insane number of formal events” that required many more dresses than she owned.
“I was just repeating the same dresses over and over and I didn’t have the money to buy new ones, so I figured...it would be cool if I could rent dresses from fellow students,” she said. The people behind Valti are also on a social mission to promote women’s empowerment and size acceptance, “which are not always seen in the fashion industry,” she said.
“For every photoshoot we have real women as our models. So far they have all been Harvard students,” said Evans. “We’re trying to emphasize diversity.”
I LIKE FALL
Marjorie Lacombe ’13, founder and president of i like fall, started the company last October as a personal endeavor to get rid of leftover clothes.“They were great clothes that other people would wear,” Lacombe said. To display the clothing to potential buyers, she made a website.
After putting up 40 items the first week and selling them quickly, she realized that a lot of other students could benefit from this, by both selling and buying clothing.
After working on the business over the summer and this semester, Lacombe has resold over 200 garments, shoes, and accessories through i like fall. The sellers get 90 percent of the profit.“We’ve also expanded to focus on improving local community initiatives,” Lacombe said.The organization has partnered with Rosie’s Lace, a women’s shelter in Boston, and donates all unsold items at the end of the semester. Like Valti, i like fall also challenges the beauty standards set by the fashion industry, through photography and media campaigns, LaCombe said.
“We have women of different colors, of different shapes, and different sizes…who are modeling our clothes and our items just to question how fashion is portraying women.”

Everyone knows that the world might or might not be ending next Friday, December 21st. Flyby's not in the business of making predictions, but just in case the Mayans were right and the last day of exam period also happens to be the end of, well, everything, we're compiling 8 lists of 8 great things (in no particular order) about the world as we know it, one for each day between now and The End.
Today's theme is Technology.
1. The Printing Press
We're looking at you, Gutenberg. As the proverb goes, Carve some words into stone and three people will read it, ever. Print the bible on handmade linen paper, and you've got a Protestant revolution on your hands, plus a great talking point for Harvard Librarians. Thanks for the memories!
2. Facebook
Love it or hate it, it's given us some great times (if not endless wasted hours). What other platform lets us stalk our middle school crush's relationship status, know what that girl from a summer program in India ate for breakfast, and discover the latest YouTube sensations, all in one place? Flyby likes this.
3. Texting
Without texting, we'd still be leaving voicemails, talking to people on the phone and in person, and paying attention in class. Sure, some people still do all of the above, and others might argue that texting in class is rude. (It is! We agree.) But it has made it far easier not to sit alone at lunch, and for that we are grateful.
4. The Polio Vaccine
Thanks to this medical technology, a disesase that affected hundreds of thousands of people in recent memory has now been nearly eliminated. None of this will matter, of course, if the world actually does end next week. But it was nice while it lasted.
5. The Internet
Wow. Such a good one, universe. From WebMD to Twitter, AOL to Google, and all the random tumblrs in between, the World Wide Web is where it's at. All of it.
6. The iPhone
All of the above, only in one place. (There's probably an anti-polio App, right?) For those of you concerned about next Friday's app-ocalypse, there's an App for that too. We recommend the Flashlight.
7. The Digital Camera
The magic of immeidate deletion makes it possible to ensure that unflattering photos never see the light of day. Unless you happen to be the one taking the photos, and have access to #5 on your #6 so the #2 community can see it forever and ever (till 12/21/12). Smile!
8. The Washing Macine
Just think how gross college would be without it. Laundry day in the Charles, anyone? No one would ever do that. So everything would be dirty. Always.

It's late at night/early in the morning and you're trying to study but that inhuman sound your stomach is making is distracting you from your last minute cram session. Where do you go to get some late night grub? We at Flyby have some suggestions.
7. CVS (1426 Massachusetts Avenue)
They're open 24/7 and have an almost endless array of junk food. You do the math.
6. Petsi Pies Cafe (31 Putnam Avenue)
Monday-Thursday, 7 a.m.-8 p.m.
Friday, 7 a.m.-6 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m.
(N.B.: Beware special holiday hours starting on Monday 12/17! The store will close at 6 p.m. most nights.)
Ok, so technically this place isn't open late, but if you pull an all-nighter the 7 a.m. opening time means it's still night for you. Petsi's has a lot of delicious pies, such as the bourbon chocolate pecan pie and apple pear cranberry, that you can buy by the slice or whole. They also have iced coffee. You'll need it.
5. The Kong (1238 Massachusetts Avenue)
Monday-Wednesday, Sunday, 11:30 a.m.-2 a.m.
Thursday, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 a.m.
Friday-Saturday, 11:30 a.m.-3 a.m.
One of two classic late-night Harvard eateries on this list, The Kong is open really late, has a sprawling menu, and a high food to dollar ratio.
4. Charlie's Kitchen (10 Eliot Street)
Monday-Wednesday, 11 a.m.-1 a.m.
Thursday-Saturday, 11 a.m.-2 a.m.
Sunday, 11 a.m.-1 a.m.
Wings, calamari, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, barbeque, seafood, burgers, dessert. Do we really have to say anything else?
3. insomnia cookies (65 Mt. Auburn Street)
Store hours, 11 a.m. - 3 a.m.
Delivery hours, 6 p.m. - 3 a.m.
This business knows just what any college students needs: cookies delivered to them at any time before 3 a.m. They understand us!
2. IHOP (16 Eliot Street #18)
Daily, 7 a.m.-4 a.m.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so don't be afraid to have it twice in one day.
1. Noch's (74 Winthrop Street)
Sunday, 1 p.m.-12 a.m.
Monday-Thursday, 11 a.m.-1 a.m.
Friday-Saturday 11 a.m.-2:30 a.m.
Did you know that you can eat Noch's even when you're sober? Well you can! Noch's is the ultimate late-night food destination. Let us do the math for you:
Good pizza=great food
2 slices of Noch's=good pizza
2 slices of Noch's < $5.
Great food < $5
That's math everyone can enjoy.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
Dec. 9, 1901: The Infirmary Opening
The Stillman Infirmary will be opened January 1, 1902.  The building is  now practically completed.  It has been decided to use the lower three  floors for the patients.  The fourth story will be used for the doctors  and nurses, and the basement will be occupied by the furnace and  kitchen.
Dec. 15, 1937: Wigglesworth Inhabitants Driven Out by Ripe Cheese
Last night a late passer-by marveled at the sight of Wigglesworth students studying on the frozen ground outside their entry.
Investigation  showed that some student had had his room smeared with copious blobs of  exceptionally ripe Limburger cheese by practical jokers.  The cheese  was so strong, however, that it "walked" right out of the room and  filtered throughout the building.
Dec. 14, 1942: Mint Seeks Pennies To Save on Copper Hoard
Instructions coming direct to the Yard from the Directory of the U.S. Mint in Washington request that all students assist in the current  campaign "to get back into circulation the idle coins that art lying  hidden in piggy banks, sugar bowls, glass jars and bureau drawers"  throughout the University.
"The 4600 tons of copper consumed last  year in making the one-cent piece," the announcement continues, "would  have met the combined requirements of copper for building 2 cruisers, 2  destroyers, 1245 flying fortresses, 120 field guns and 120 howitzers."
Dec. 14, 1963: Dining Halls Plan Substitute Entrees
Upperclassmen with 12 o'clock classes will be able to eat in the Union  from 11:45 a.m. to 12 noon beginning with lunch Jan. 6, and after that  date Central Kitchen dining halls will offer "acceptable meat  substitutes" for their less popular dinner entrees.
Dec. 15, 1972: HSA Board Vetoes Selling Contraceptives in Union
The Board of Directors of Harvard Student Agencies yesterday  ended all chances that HSA would sell condoms and vaginal foams at its  concession stand in the Freshman Union.
In a compromise motion,  the directors decided to sell condoms from a vending machine at the  University Health Services, pending UHS's approval.
The Board  rejected the proposal to avoid "adverse publicity," Arthur I. Segel '73,  president of HSA, said yesterday.  He added that the directors'  approval would have been useless.  He said they sensed that "the  Administration wouldn't let us do it anyway."

Everyone knows that the world might or might not be ending next Friday, December 21. Flyby's not in the business of making predictions, but just in case the Mayans were right and the last day of exam period also happens to be the end of, well, everything, we're compiling eight lists of some great things (in no particular order) about the world as we know it, one for each day between now and The End.
While it's a shame the world's going to end before the 2010s conclude, the approaching apocalypse does provide us with an exceptional opportunity for reflection on the good times humanity has had. In that spirit, here's Flyby's list of the five best decades ever. Runners-up included the 1870s, when the Harvard Crimson invented journalism.
 
#5 – The 1630s
Harvard was founded, as was New Haven. In solemn memory of this great decade, reenact the Harvard-Yale game in your dorm room.
 
#4 – The 1560s
They may have been a little more straight-laced than the 1960s, but the 1560s were still chock-full of exciting events, like the invention of the pencil and the birth of William Shakespeare. Celebrate by doodling with a pencil, though, not by writing your essay on "Hamlet."
 
#3 – The 50s
The 1950s are often thought of a squeaky clean era, but this decade truly deserves that reputation: in the year 50, the Gauls introduced soap to the Roman Empire. A crucial moment in the history of cleanliness, and a fine reason to take a hot shower instead of studying up on epidemiology.
#2 – The 1780s
The Revolutionary War ends and America adopts a Constitution by the end of the decade. The French Revolution gets off to a roaring start with the storming of the Bastille. Commemorate these momentous events by revolting against your French and/or American history coursework.
 
#1 – 1990s
Perhaps it's too early to be nostalgic for the 1990s, but rarely has a decade given us so much to look back on fondly. Certainly there were a few low points, like Vanilla Ice and the Siege of Sarajevo, but most of the good stuff is conveniently available on Netflix. If you're not studying, you better be watching "Beavis and Butt-head."
