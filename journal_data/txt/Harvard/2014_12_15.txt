After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few nights ago, University President Drew Faust released a statement on the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases that reads as follows:
“Black lives matter. It has taken far too long to make that fundamental truth a living, essential part of the fabric of our society, our government, and our lives. Martin Luther King Jr. made clear a half century ago why we can’t wait. What was urgent then is imperative now.”
Immediately after the statement’s release, my Facebook newsfeed filled with justified indignation from my fellow students. President Faust’s statement utterly fails to do justice to the situation, to the sensitive and important issues these two rulings bring to the forefront, to the tension that the current state of race relations in America rightfully engenders—and has engendered since well before the cases in Ferguson and Staten Island—in much of the student body. Since then, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has weighed in with a far more complete response; still, I wonder how President Faust considered her woefully inadequate statement an appropriate reaction.
In particular, a classmate pointed out the enormous disparity between this paragraph and President Faust’s much longer, more detailed response to the controversy regarding an Extension School group’s planned “Black Mass” last semester. I do not object to the length of the latter by itself. Though I did not find the Black Mass personally offensive, I recognize why others did, and the University was justified in providing a thorough response. But if that situation merited four paragraphs, how do Michael Brown and Eric Garner merit only four sentences?
To me, this incident conforms to a pattern of behavior from the University that I have come to term “understandable, but not defensible.” It is understandable, but not defensible, that the administration is reticent to divest from fossil fuels and eschew legacy-based admissions. This kind of institutional inertia is unsurprising even as both fact and opinion move away from Harvard’s positions. It is understandable, but not defensible, that the University hesitates in reforming its sexual assault policies. One need only look at current controversies at University of Virginia and within the University of California system to see the pressure against meaningful action, however sorely that action is required.
And it is understandable, but certainly not defensible, that President Faust’s statements on the two controversies—on the Black Mass and on black lives—differ so greatly. The former directly involved Harvard and happened on campus. The latter is, at least to those of us not dealing daily with systematic racism, tangential to the University. The former arguably required more explanation such that students on the two sides of the issue could better understand each others’ ideological foundations. The latter is more cut-and-dry, with an eminently hashtaggable three word phrase—“black lives matter”—that summarizes the conflict and one’s stance on the subject. These justifications are understandable, but not defensible.
But what makes this disparity truly problematic is the power dynamic involved. When President Faust wrote an extensive response to the Black Mass, the offended group was the empowered one. While claims can perhaps be made to some historical mistreatment of Catholicism, it still represents the larger, more mainstream voice compared with Satanic rituals, even Satanic rituals performed in the interest of historical inquiry. The same cannot even remotely be said of the current situation, in which a clearly oppressed group attempts to speak out against its oppressors.
President Faust’s response in March established that she could use her statements to make substantive comments on controversial subjects. This makes the inadequacy of her recent statement even more glaring. Six months ago, she chose to exercise her power to support an empowered group with which she could likely identify. This would not be offensive if not for the fact that Faust has now chosen not to exercise the same power to support a marginalized minority, a decision that sadly conforms to the administration’s pattern of understandable, but not defensible, behavior.
I do not allege conscious mistakes on President Faust’s part, only oversight arising from the deeply flawed system and society of which she is a part. Indeed, I hope I am misinterpreting her short statement. Perhaps the intent was to be more powerful through brevity. But the complete failure to mention any of the reasons the current situation is so urgent—the proximate causes of the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, the campus context of this month’s protests and “I, Too, Am Harvard,” the greater problem of race in America—precludes this optimistic interpretation.
As I write this, I am fully aware that I do so from a position of extreme privilege. As a white man from an upper-middle class suburban home, I will never experience the kinds of injustice that have led to this month’s protests. I can neither pretend I comprehend how it must currently feel to be an African American watching and experience these events nor attempt to speak on behalf of those who do. I can only express my own disappointment and offer my voice for direction towards its greatest use.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In discussing race, let’s momentarily put aside the details of the individual cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The specifics of Brown’s death are disputed, and Garner’s are more disturbing on the surface. But the magnified focus that the media and masses have put on their two cases has distracted from their larger significance as symbols of America’s strained race relations.
Black teens are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white teens. Blacks also make up 12 to 13 percent of the US, but 40 percent of its prison population. And racism is still very much alive in America. These realities are beyond justification, and the deaths of Brown and Garner have the potential to be rallying points for this cause. However, the movement in the wake of their deaths, and specifically since the police officers’ acquittals, has so far failed to address these issues adequately.
Demonstrators have swept social media and marched through America’s largest cities. Harvard has experienced this firsthand, from a protest that shut down the Square, to a die-in outside Memorial Church, to a march down Mt. Auburn Street. Much of the student body has gotten involved, and both University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana issued statements last week.
The moral necessity to fix the racial issues leading to recent events is clear. But these demonstrations—both at Harvard and nationally—have lacked the defined leadership and concrete plans necessary for progress.
Brown and Garner’s deaths are on track to be just more catalysts of unrest. Each day the situation looks eerily closer to the 1991 case of Rodney King, when King’s brutal beating at the hands of Los Angeles police, and the acquittal of three of the four involved officers, sparked massive riots but failed to propel any substantial social change.
On the other hand, Brown and Garner’s deaths are still fresh, and the public unrest they have caused has the potential to materialize into something more productive. When the 14-year-old Emmett Till was murdered in 1955—at the hands of two racially motivated men who were also not indicted—it became a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement.
King and Till are similar cases with significantly different results. So we must ask what differentiates these two cases and how to apply these lessons to recent events.
First is the presence of defined leadership. One hundred days after Till’s death, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus. And when a citywide bus boycott started, a 26-year-old minister named Martin Luther King Jr. was called in to help lead.
The post-Ferguson movement needs a strong leader. Al Sharpton “pouring gasoline on the fire” through TV appearances does not fit the bill. President Obama, in the midst of legacy shopping could fill the role by making racial issues a top priority during his last two years in office. But a social leader—as seen in MLK—could also emerge on the national scale and lead the charge. Irrespective of the individual, this leader must have the necessary skills and experience as well as credibility.
Second is the establishment of definitive means of attaining justice. While Rodney King’s case merely unleashed anger regarding race relations, Emmett Till’s murder helped spawn a campaign with tangible legislative aims. The civil rights movement gave rise to actual process because its objectives of equal protection under the law and an end to segregation were concrete.
In recent weeks, some of the scores of petitions—arguably the most effective organization of demonstrators since Ferguson—have proposed putting body cameras on police. Others have advocated an end to racial profiling. An end to mass incarceration has also been mentioned. However, there has been little coordination as to what exactly the movement’s steps should be going forward.
At the Harvard Square demonstrations protesters shouted, “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!” The need for justice is clear, and the value of promoting awareness cannot be understated. But at a certain point it is necessary to start focusing more on action.
Columbia Professor Fredrick Harris asked: Is this going to be a moment or a movement? Unless the political or social means of attaining justice are defined and pioneered by organized leadership, the continuous cycle of America’s troubling race relations will persist. America’s black citizens will continue to be subjected to racism and its consequences, and every once in a while a particular case will spark national uproar. First Trayvon Martin. Then Michael Brown. Now Eric Garner. Breaking this cycle requires more than just the noise of protests; it requires taking a step back to analyze the weaknesses of the current movement, make the necessary changes, and accordingly move forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and the subsequent non-indictments of the police officers who caused their deaths, have shocked and saddened observers around the nation. For the past two weeks, hundreds of members of the Harvard community have come together in peaceful responses to institutional violence against minorities. The die-ins and marches have shown Harvard students at their best: The gatherings have largely been thoughtful, inclusive, and scrupulously planned. They have galvanized the university community to speak out against police brutality and pervasive institutionalized racism.
The protest on Wednesday night was a gathering of a different kind. It was planned with understandable intentions: to disrupt an established campus tradition and to show that injustice exists even in the most inconvenient moments. After all, protests on the sidelines can never match the impact of more disruptive actions in forcing the important conversations.
However, the Primal Scream protest was poorly thought out and proved to be disruptive in a hurtful way. Protestors reported that some Primal Screamers cursed at them and made lewd and threatening gestures. As a result, many protestors left feeling threatened, disrespected, and hurt. No arguments or justifications can detract from their experiences; circumstances do not excuse insensitive behavior.
At the same time, we cannot ignore the organizational tactics that caught the participants of Primal Scream off guard. From the start, the publicizing of the protest was insufficient; at the event itself, a large portion of the runners—many of whom were confused and intoxicated—did not even realize that demonstrators were asking for a moment of silence as they stood naked in the freezing rain. Moreover, the runners were preoccupied only with running a lap and putting their clothes back on, the weather being quite cold. In retrospect, it was completely unreasonable for a group of clothed people to demand without warning that their naked classmates stand silently in the cold.
Primal Scream is meant to be a community event, a time for bonding and stress relief. Whether intentionally or not, this particular protest was divisive, casting as opponents a group of confused and probably quite cold individuals who may or may not have stood with the protestors if given due notice.
The systematic oppression of non-white Americans is clearly a cause that deserves attention and outrage. The Harvard community speaks loudest when it speaks in one voice, not when it is divided. Even in these emotionally tense times, we should not engage in behaviors that turn students against each other. Though the Primal Scream protest boosted campus awareness of the movement, it did so at the cost of dividing the community, and led many Primal Screamers to feel that they too had been misunderstood and mischaracterized.
These issues with this particular protest should not detract from the movement itself, for its message is too important. All of us should be outraged; all of us should be protestors. But even as students on this campus protest, they must resist tactics designed to create rifts within the university community. Had Wednesday’s protest been organized with intent to unite, Primal Scream could have become a moving example of Harvard standing as one against injustice.
We fervently hope that the protest on Wednesday night and its aftermath prove to be an outlier. The movement is centered on the importance of human respect; compromising this core principle succeeds only in harming the movement and its goal. Internal discord forgets the desperate and essential point: Black lives matter.

Joseph N. Fonge pleaded guilty last Wednesday to three counts of wire fraud after inaccurately reporting financial information to the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid between 2010 and 2013.
Joseph N. Fonge and his wife Barbara E. Fonge reported false income figures to the University to defraud the College of financial aid funding for their child, who graduated from the College in 2013, according to a criminal complaint filed on June 27.
Financial aid applicants submit the federal FAFSA form to determine eligibility for federal aid and the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE for purposes of calculating institutional aid. The College also uses IDOC, an information service operated by the College Board that collects financial information, such as federal income tax returns, and electronically provides colleges with such forms.
“Joseph N. Fonge and Barbara E. Fonge caused false and fraudulent financial information to be submitted to FAFSA and IDOC, by, among other things, underreporting their wages, income, sources of income, and adjusted gross income reported on their federal income tax returns,” U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz and Assistant U.S. Attorney Victoria A. Wild wrote in the complaint.
The Fonge family received over $50,000 in annual financial aid for two years until 2012, when the “scheme to defraud was discovered by Harvard College,” according to the June complaint.
Former Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning previously told The Crimson that the Admissions Office takes questions of fraud seriously and works “to make sure all financial aid is awarded and disbursed appropriately.” Current FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to provide an updated comment this weekend on the Fonge case or on the frequency of suspected financial aid fraud.
Barbara and Joseph Fonge could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 16, 2014, at 7:26 a.m.
After years of fundraising efforts, the Harvard Men’s Ultimate Frisbee Club has established an endowment that will supplement grants from the Undergraduate Council and the Department of Athletics.
The endowment, which draws from the donations of more than 150 former team members, will help offset participation costs. Although representatives for the club declined to reveal dollar figures, they indicated that the endowment is large enough to waive all freshman membership fees for the fall season.
“The goal for the funds…is to spend them as deliberately and transparently as possible,” said Wynn O. Tucker '15, co-captain of the club's A team. “There’s been a lot of communication and deliberation about how to do this right.”
The fund will also subsidize the travel costs of the team. The organization’s A team has earned a spot in the College National Championships for ultimate frisbee seven times in the last decade, which has increased the group’s transportation costs.
“We’ve done fundraising in the past, but not to the same level of organization,” said current coach and former player Michael MacKenzie. “It gives the alumni network some structure.”
Over the past eight years, the club has mobilized alumni support each year by naming a “class captain,” who reached out to other members to solicit funds.
“It’s really a testament to the strength of this program, and the power of this program, that this was able to be pulled off,” Tucker said. “You look at the participants in the endowment, and you see the impact that the team has had on people.”
The group’s fundraising success contrasts with the monetary struggles that other club sports have faced in recent years. In particular, due to budgetary constraints, the most grant money a club can receive from the UC each semester decreased from $2,000 in 2012 to the current funding maximum of $1,400.
During their UC campaign this fall, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 urged the Council to solicit alumni donations to support student group funding.
“We would be interested in talking to [the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee Club] and discussing how they went about sourcing alumni donations and whether this could be a model for other club sports as well,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “While they do rely on UC funding, it’s great for them to look at other resources.”
However, the pair intends to continue funding club sports teams out of the Council’s existing budget.
“It’s very important to recognize that the smaller groups may not have an elaborate alumni pool to tap into,” Goyal said. “That’s where the Undergraduate Council comes in.”
Founded in 1975, the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee Club long relied on a combination of student dues, grants from the UC and the Athletics Department, and irregular alumni donations to support the program. The story changed in 2013, when then co-captain William P. Chen ’06 spearheaded an effort to establish a long-term fund.
“[Harvard Ultimate Frisbee] allowed me to compete in a sport I love and to meet some of my closest friends to this day,” Chen said. “This program has brought me so much happiness, so helping organize this endowment was a welcomed chance to give back.”

The amount of compostable materials being disposed of in traditional trash bins in freshman dormitories has decreased by 20 percent compared to previous years, according to a waste audit conducted at the beginning of November.
The Office for Sustainability's website attributes the reduction to the introduction of compost bins in all freshman dorm rooms three months ago.
Organized by Harvard Recycling, the waste audit was conducted through the coordinated efforts of building managers and undergraduate representatives from Harvard’s Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program.
According to Brandon P. Geller ’08, the manager of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Green Program and a freshman proctor, Harvard Recycling worked with building managers to set aside a random sampling of trash bags to be examined. The trash was then taken to Harvard Recycling’s warehouse for the audit, where the waste was then sorted and eventually weighed. Student volunteers manually separated trash, recycling, and compostable materials from a random sample of trash bags taken from Harvard Yard.
The audit also included trash taken from Harvard’s upperclassman Houses, although bags were labeled by their original location to ensure accurate data collection.
Geller said individual buildings and University schools have been conducting their own waste audits for several years. Volunteers and REP student employees normally conduct the audits.
Geller added that there was no significant difference between the amount of compostable material in the Houses’ waste stream between this year and last.
“We’re working towards having better numbers overall,” Geller said.
He added that the University’s new trash disposal contractor, Republic Services, Inc., is beginning to gather new baseline information that will be made available near the end of the spring semester. “We should be able to know holistically how much waste we’re creating and how much compost we’re creating,” Geller said of this change.
Some students have found the reduction in food waste encouraging in efforts to expand the freshman composting program.
“The numbers make it more likely that we will see [composting] in the Houses,” Clifford F. W. Goertemiller ’17, a student intern with REP, said.
“[Composting] almost certainly will be moved to the Houses. The challenge we face now is whether it’s a program provided to students or a program students have to opt in to,” Goertemiller added.
Harvard Recycling has not published any other data gathered during the November waste audit.

Harvard undergraduates baked activism into sweets Friday, as they tried to raise funds for Harvard’s still-understaffed office charged with investigating sexual violence cases one chai spiced snickerdoodle cookie at a time.
Harvard announced the creation of the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution this summer as a part of its first unified sexual assault and misconduct policy. The office is a centralized body tasked with investigating complaints from all University schools that fall under the new policy.
The office intends to hire three full time investigators in total to work alongside Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides and other staff, but two of those positions have remained vacant for months and have yet to be filled.
Organizers from Our Harvard Can Do Better, a sexual assault activism group who sponsored Friday’s bake sale, worry that the listed salary range for the investigators, which The Crimson first reported in September, may not lure qualified candidates and could stymie the office’s work.
In an effort to expedite the hiring process and raise awareness of what they see as an underfunded and understaffed office, members of Our Harvard Can Do Better hosted a bake sale with the intention of directing the proceeds to ODR and the umbrella University Title IX Office. The group suggested donations of 36 cents per item, an overt allusion to what they see as the misallocation of dividends from Harvard’s more than $36 billion endowment.
In total, the group raised about $120, as well as 10 Canadian dollars, according to the event’s Facebook page. It is unclear whether ODR accepts donations and University spokesperson Jeff Neal did not respond to a question attempting to clarify the matter. Karvonides did not respond to requests for comment.
Neal wrote in an emailed statement that ODR has recently hired two other additional staff members and is continuing to review applications for the investigator positions. The centralized office has not released the number of investigations it has received so far. ODR will likely also begin to take on investigations for complaints raised by and against Faculty members in the future, if a set of changes to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies on the matter are adopted as expected.
“Obviously it’s a satire,” Emily M. Fox-Penner '17, an organizer, said of the bake sale. “Harvard is under two federal civil rights investigations for a grossly inadequate response to sexual violence. The [ODR] is supposed to be the flagship initiative to actually demonstrate substantive response, and the fact that six months after it’s founded, it...is grossly underfunded just hugely highlights that this is a cosmetic initiative.”
Jessica R. Fournier '17, another organizer, said that the office has taken an “incredibly long time” in preparing yet-to-be-published secondary materials on the new University-wide policy, leading her to believe office staff was overworked.
Responding to claims that the office was understaffed, Neal wrote that it has contracted “highly experienced” attorneys to help its only staff investigator, William D. McCants, as the ODR continues to review applications for the permanent positions. Neal wrote that those contractors, working with permanent staff, are investigating cases “professionally, thoroughly, fairly and in full accordance with the newly adopted University procedures.”

Boston leaders from Harvard, The Boston Globe, Massachusetts General Hospital, and MIT announced plans to host a celebration of innovation in medicine, art, and technology in Boston called HUBweek at a press conference Friday.
The weeklong festival, scheduled for next October, will include hackathons, conferences, art exhibits, cultural performances, and other activities. Events will be held around Boston and Cambridge, including some on Harvard’s campus.
“HUBweek will give a stage and a voice to those innovators and to the paths they are forging towards new solutions,” University President Drew G. Faust said at the press conference. “Harvard is very proud to be a part of it.”
The festival organizers plan to bring together a diversity of professionals and thinkers to develop creative “solutions to global and local issues,” according to a press release.
“[It’s] something that would celebrate and showcase this extraordinary region with its vast scientific, technologic, intellectual, economic, and cultural strengths,” MGH President Peter L. Slavin said at the press conference. “It [won’t] be an event or a conference...but a gathering of curious people who would think big, be bold, and relish the opportunity to solve major problems.”
Slavin added that he hoped HUBweek will bring together the best minds in medicine to address issues in medical research and health care, including cancer, HIV, and diabetes.
One of the featured events of the festival is a series of "master classes" in which planners hope to turn Fenway Park into a 37,000-seat classroom where distinguished speakers will lecture on topics from research to philanthropy.
Boston’s HUBweek follows a trend of popular festivals showcasing regional innovation that have been celebrated across the nation, such as the South by Southwest festival in Austin and the Aspen Ideas Festival. Organizers hope this festival will draw the same attention for Boston as a creative hub.
“We believe that the future is being built right here in Boston,” Globe Managing Director Linda Pizzuti Henry said at the press conference. “We think that the unique confluence of art, technology, and science that is the hallmark of this region makes it the ideal setting to inspire and bring together leaders, disruptors, rebels, thinkers, and change agents locally and from around the world.”

The Harvard men’s ice hockey team received a promotion today without even stepping on the ice this past week.
The team (9-1-2, 5-1-2 ECAC) hasn’t played since its 5-2 win at Quinnipiac on Dec. 6 yet jumped from fifth to fourth in both of the national weekly polls on Monday. Beanpot rival Boston University (11-3-2) also moved up in the top five, overtaking the University of North Dakota (13-4-2) for the top spot in both polls.
No. 4/4 Harvard picked up five more first-place votes in each poll to leapfrog No. 5/5 Michigan Tech (13-3-0). The Crimson took 11 out of 50 first-place votes in the USCHO poll and nine out of 33 first-place votes in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll.  Among first-place vote getters, Harvard trailed BU and UND in the former poll yet only BU in the latter.
The Crimson also boasts the highest winning percentage (.8333) of all 59 Division I teams, a sliver ahead of Michigan Tech (.8125), and ranks fourth in PairWise and RPI.
After beginning the season unranked, the Harvard icemen are off to their quickest start since the 1992-1993 season. The team will return to the ice on Dec. 28 for an exhibition game against the Russian Red Stars—a team comprised of all-stars from a European junior league—before hosting conference rival Rensselaer on Dec. 30.
