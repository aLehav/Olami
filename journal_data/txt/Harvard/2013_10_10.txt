Sleigh Bells’ upbeat, anthemic music is the stuff of which teen movie soundtracks and product advertisements are made—and the noise-pop duo have indeed won some dozen film and TV soundtrack credits through their innovative melding of hip-hop and stadium rock. With their new release “Bitter Rivals,” however, the band create a work that, while composed of perfectly crafted individual tracks, lacks the cohesiveness and narrative structure that would allow it to succeed as an album.
  The most accurate descriptor of Sleigh Bells’ sound would be “big”: the tracks on “Bitter Rivals” unfailingly create the impression of having been recorded in a 50,000-person arena. The title track features bridges reminiscent of the glory days of Queen, while the opening of “Minnie” shapes itself around old-school punk rock guitar riffs. The band have mastered the art of melding singer Alexis Krauss’ voice, often compellingly breathy and feminine, with what might be considered the most macho instrumentation in pop music—and while melody does not seem to be a priority on the album, the duo more than compensate with sheer enthusiastic yelling, juxtaposed at just the right intervals with brief pop hooks to keep individual tracks from becoming dull. 
  But Sleigh Bells’ strength lies in their musicality, not in their lyricism. Although most tracks have at least one witty turn of phrase—“Love Sick” contains the gem “There’s a heart in my chest / where a hole used to be / There’s a hole in my chest / where my heart used to be,” and “Young Legends” features the line “You always act like / war is knocking at your door”—the lyrics within each song seem to consist primarily of unrelated one-liners, and the songs themselves fail to deliver any kind of greater message. Oftentimes it seems that the words Krauss sings are little more than gibberish: in “Minnie,” she blurts the confusing and nonsensical line “Minnie, Minnie / go count your pennies / I’m sorry to say / you don’t have any,” while the very title of “Sing Like a Wire” is a testament to the song’s utter lack of lyrical logic.
   It becomes increasingly obvious as the album proceeds that Sleigh Bells did not consider “Bitter Rivals” from a sufficiently broad perspective: the album’s first 20-some minutes amount to a wall of sonic overload. Though the band’s distinctively booming, echoing sound is palatable in small doses and makes for ideal party music, its overwhelming presence in “Bitter Rivals” is tiring for the ears and uninspiring for the intellect. The first respite arrives with “To Hell With You,” which features a lilting, delicate melody overpowered by the heavy instrumentation that comes in later in the track and abuse of the kick drum. But 30 minutes of thick noise-pop with one slower interlude toward the end does not a good album make, and Sleigh Bells gloss over poignant, quieter moments in songs like “24” and “Love Sick” that, with expansion, would render the album a much stronger work.
   Each song on “Bitter Rivals” does not disappoint, but the work sounds like a collection of singles more than it does an album. Perhaps the tracks are meant that way, as individual anthems for the brief, ever-changing moments in the youthful soul, rather than as a logical whole. Though “Bitter Rivals” hammers incessantly, it it is still Sleigh Bells’ cleanest and most melodic work yet is indicative of the nature of their sound, and it seems that this new release signifies an attempt to move in a more appealing and subdued direction. One can expect great music from Sleigh Bells—it is simply that they, like the self-discovering adolescents of whom their music is so reminiscent, must first endure growing pains before reaping the rewards of adulthood.

Atlas Genius is an alternative rock band formed in Adelaide, Australia whose 2011 hit song  “Trojans” catapulted them up from down under into worldwide fame. They followed the single with their debut LP “When it Was Now,” a commercial and critical success. Their current tour in support of the album brought them to the House of Blues Boston on Tuesday, so The Crimson sat down with lead singer Keith Jeffery to ask a couple questions.
 
THC: With your newfound success, do you feel any pressure on your upcoming works?
 
KJ: The biggest pressures are internal pressures that we put on ourselves to keep growing as musicians and songwriters. There are external pressures as well. The harshest critic is yourself in this field of work. You always want to keep pushing yourself. It’s important not to be affected by external pressures. You have to compartmentalize internal pressures and not be influenced too much by what people say of want.
 
THC: Is there any particular track on your hit album, “When It Was Now,” that you’re particularly fond of?
 
KJ: I am really satisfied with “Centered on You.” The spontaneity of how it came together so quickly means that I have a particular fondness for that song. Quite often writing a song can be a real struggle and a journey to get it to where you want to be. That song came together really quickly.
 
THC: You guys are coming to Boston in a couple days. Some bands prefer big venues and others prefer small intimate settings—do you have an opinion? 
 
KJ: I do like big shows. I think venues around 1, or 2,000 people people are a good size. It’s not gigantic, but the energy when you get a couple thousand people all in one space being connected by music [is good]. When you’re playing for 10 or 20,000 people it’s harder to engage, I think, because you’re a small guy on stage and there are so many people. However, the bigger the crowd, the less nervous we get. I’m the most nervous when I’m playing in front of two or five people.”
 
THC: Any pre-show rituals? 
 
KJ: I spend five minutes or so alone so I can get in the right space for the show. Just before we hit the stage we get together as a band to get that energy and that camaraderie thing happening.
 
THC: How would you say your Australian roots have influenced your music?
 
KJ: Typically I think Australians are a bit more reserved than maybe Americans. I think that comes across in the music. I think understated is the word I’m looking for [in our production].
 
THC: Do you notice any big differences between the Australian music scene and the scene back here in the states?
 
KJ: I think because we’re such a small country and it’s been hard for bands for a long time to get out and make a mark elsewhere, Australian bands are used to having to work hard to prove themselves. The other side of that I think is Australian bands tend to get more pessimistic because of that.
 
THC: Were you at all surprised about your success here in the States?
 
KJ: Yes, because we were at the point of thinking that it was very unlikely to stand out and be noticed in the music industry. Especially now, when every second person has some kind of recording system on their laptop and there is a huge cloud of music out there. The fact that “Trojans” was noticed was definitely a big surprise.
 
THC: Outside of music do you have any other hidden talents?
 
KJ: I like to think I make a decent Indian curry. It may be one of my hidden talents. Perhaps I could be an Indian chef someday.

Last April, the Harvard Museum of Natural History sponsored a trip to a land of “searing beauty” with “a long and remarkable history stretching over 2,500 years,” to “explore [its] fabulous bazaars…and to converse with the people who call it home.” As someone who enjoys traveling, especially to countries rich in history, the trip had caught my interest—until I realized that the destination was Iran. As Harvard programs and organizations plan their travel, they should avoid Iran. The Museum of Natural History’s trip this past year highlighs the broader, persistent case for steering clear.
Although newly elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has just concluded his “charm offensive” at the United Nations in search of better relations with America and the West, we shouldn’t so easily forget that "Marg bar Amrika!" (Death to America) has long been a common rallying cry in the country. Despite Rouhani’s recent words of conciliation, Iran continues its threatening pursuit of a comprehensive nuclear program.
Nevertheless, it makes complete sense for a vigilant America to give diplomacy with Iran a chance. After all, the deal that the United States, Russia, and Syria recently made to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles seems to be bearing some fruit. But until Iran takes verifiable steps to end its nuclear weapons program, Harvard should not schedule any more trips to Iran.
To do otherwise would send the message that Harvard doesn’t have to abide by the economic sanctions that the United States, its allies, and the United Nations have imposed on Iran due to its truculent pursuit of nuclear weapons. Visiting the bazaars would suggest that Harvard has no problem with Iran’s sending weapons, soldiers, and money to support the Syrian government’s murderous campaign against its own citizens. It would also show that we’re not overly concerned that Iran has a long history of funding terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas or that it has threatened to stop the flow of oil out of the Strait of Hormuz.
Moreover, until our country lifts economic sanctions against Iran, which may very well have been the impetus for Rouhani’s quest for better relations, we should not ease that pressure by supporting Iran’s tourism industry. And although the State Department does not explicitly ban travel to Iran, it does issue ample warnings that “some elements in Iran remain hostile to the United States” and “as a result, U.S. citizens may be subject to harassment or arrest while traveling or residing in Iran.”
The State Department’s travel warning explicitly cautions U.S. citizens of Iranian origin to “consider the risk of being targeted by authorities” because several Iranian-American citizens such as journalists and academics who have spent time in Iran for personal or professional reasons have been held in the country against their will, sometimes for months.
According to the warning report, American citizens who are not of Iranian descent have also been “unjustly detained or imprisoned on various charges, including espionage and posing a threat to national security.” People of the Bahá'í faith, Arabs, Kurds, and Azeris should also think twice before signing up to visit Iran, due to its government’s long history of repressing these minority groups.
To complete the list of people who may be better off traveling elsewhere, former Muslims who converted to other religions may be subject to “arrest and prosecution” along with people who encourage Muslims to convert. For all these people and every other American, the State Department warns that they should not expect a great deal of assistance from the American government if things go awry, as the United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran.
When I called the Harvard Museum last year to see if I’d be permitted to join this trip given that I had traveled to Israel the year before, the spokesperson for the traveling program suggested I get a second passport, because Iran, through the medium of the Pakistani embassy, would not issue me a visa if my passport had been stamped with Israel’s seal.
Intercultural exchange that brings individual Americans and Iranians together is important, especially since the two governments are at odds. However, no one should have to hide his previous travel log in order to participate in this exchange. Iran needs to go far beyond rhetoric in making genuine reforms before trips to Iran can be of any use in mending relations between America and its implacable enemy.
Last year’s trip to Iran was definitely premature. Any future trips must be contingent upon Iran’s concrete implementation of political and humanitarian reforms, especially upon its dismantling of its bellicose nuclear weapons program. I look forward to a time in which Iran greets Americans with more than just welcoming words of peace, and in which Harvard can with good conscience resume arranging its tours to this ancient land.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, then-president of Mexico Felipe Calderón unveiled a hulking three-ton sign built from crushed firearms. The sign, reading “No More Weapons,” was designed to make a statement against the ongoing drug war which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Mexicans and has caused the disappearance of thousands more to date. Calderon’s choice of Ciudad Juárez —a city just across the border from El Paso, Texas—as the site of the monument was far from random; the same goes for his decision to deliver the message in English. After all, the very weapons used to create the sign were confiscated from American gun traffickers.
The very weapons that, had they passed into the drug cartels’ hands, would have aided in the bloodshed of thousands of innocent Mexicans.
Almost a year after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and just over two weeks after deadly shootings in Chicago and at the U.S Navy Yard, Americans remain divided over whether to proceed with stricter gun control legislation. Representative of the debate’s two sides are President Obama, who has once again called for tighter regulations, and National Rifle Association President David A. Keene, who last semester assured Harvard students that they “would probably be safer” if Harvard allowed possession of firearms on campus.
Each day this debate goes on unresolved, American guns claim more victims. But it is not just American blood for which we are responsible. Our continued indecision has prolonged and exacerbated the suffering of our neighbor to the south.
Wherever you stand on the Second Amendment, remember that Mexico’s laws are much less permitting. Yet its neighbors along the U.S. border boast increasingly lax policies, like Texas’s “Gun Day” legislation and an Arizona quasi-secessionist bill that failed to gain the support of even the NRA. The border is as much ours as it is Mexico’s, and it is thus as much our responsibility to prevent gun trafficking as it is Mexico’s to eliminate the drug cartels’ influence in the region. We, with thousands of legal firearm dealers along the U.S-Mexico border, are not blameless. Mexico, after all, has just one—its military.
What can we do? One thing is clear: We cannot abide by and do nothing. Our current gun laws have not just perpetuated gun violence in the United States but have also had deadly repercussions abroad. Irresponsible as it may be to continue to deprive Americans of responsible gun legislation, it is outright unjust to cause suffering in another country that has done nothing to solicit our weapons. Frustratingly for Mexico, it can do little about its border with the U.S. But the U.S can do something about its gun laws.
One thing we can do is to lengthen prison sentences for those who have been found to purchase firearms with the intent of trafficking them. In fact, legislation proposed by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy would do just that. But amid legislative gridlock that crushed most amendments to existing gun legislation, Congress has been remiss to address gun trafficking. And half a year later, the bill remains in legislative purgatory, still awaiting a vote—the prospects of which, in light of the government shutdown stalemate, grow ever bleaker.
If the bill does make it through the Senate, it would be a good start—but certainly not a finish. Responsible legislation against gun trafficking is a mild treatment for the symptom, not for the cause. Rather, we must be vigilant and take a stance against the accessibility of these guns. If a gun trafficker—someone whose purpose in purchasing a weapon is to sell it across the border—can easily obtain weapons through legal means, then who else are we allowing to purchase guns?
This isn’t revolutionary. This is common sense.
Moving forward, the United States should not abide by the status quo—unless we truly are content with the violence against thousands of Americans and Mexicans along the border. Instead, we should take the initiative on policies that will help end Mexico’s drug war for good. Simple, commonsense policies like increasing criminal sanctions against gun traffickers can remove American fuel from the conflagration of the Mexican drug war. But what Mexicans deserve, and what Americans deserve, is a long-term, bilateral solution to the drug war.
Although the drug war has disproportionately taken Mexican lives, the U.S. and Mexico must be held equally accountable for combating it. Some simple U.S. policy changes can, at the very least, prevent the situation from getting worse. Stricter gun laws, in conjunction with other policies like the legalization of marijuana, have obvious implications for Mexico’s drug war. It’s simple algebra: fewer guns, fewer cartels, fewer deaths.
The Mexican drug war will not end overnight. Nor will it end as a result of one American policy, or two, or 20. It will be a long struggle. But it is a struggle we must confront and for which we must take responsibility. It’s not just Mexico’s struggle, and it must not just be Mexico that works to end it. And in the meantime, the bare minimum we can do is to send
“No More Weapons.”

Not long ago, it seems, frozen yogurt was ice cream’s second-rate cousin: the exclusive province of dieters, hippies, and people without taste buds.
Today, Harvard Square paints a very different picture. Although Cambridge has always been in the vanguard of the frozen yogurt movement—allegedly, the world’s first “frogurt” cone was served in the Square in 1971—consumers’ options have multiplied in recent years.  There’s local favorite Berryline, national chain Pinkberry, and self-serve newcomer Yogurtland. Even those stores known more for their ice cream have frozen yogurt on offer: J.P. Licks, Ben and Jerry’s, and Lizzy’s (we know, we’ve never been to Lizzy’s either, but it really is over there on Church Street).
The froyo boom is a great thing for sweet-toothed consumers—who knew there were so many fun compound words to be made with “berry”?
More importantly, more competition means more variety (including low-sugar and low-fat varieties), as well as deals and discounts as franchises try to attract patrons. The craze has even led to innovation in business models: Yogurtland (like 16 Handles, Red Mango, and other brands) saves on labor costs by offering self- rather than counter-service.
A good (or even not-so-good) student of Economics 10 might find this puzzling: why are people willing to pay about as much for frozen yogurt when they’ve got to supply the labor themselves?
Because the self-serve model gives consumers a sense of control, letting them select flavors, toppings, and quantities. Its brilliance lies in its juxtaposition of perceived health and opulence. At Yogurtland, for instance, flavors range from Red Velvet Cupcake Batter to Pecans and Pralines to Blue Lychee Bliss Tart, add-ons from caramel syrup to cookies to fruit. But, go to pay (and with a Harvard ID, get the first three ounces free), and you’re still just buying yogurt.
Frozen yogurt is clearly more than a fad—the question is whether so many similar stores can thrive in such close proximity.  Froyo retailers enjoy high profit margins; Harvard Square’s many vendors may all benefit from a surge in consumer awareness and a shift in their preferences (towards the tangy and proteinaceous). Alternatively, Cambridge froyo may be entering a period of creative destruction in which only the strong—or, perhaps, most beautifully swirled—survive. To each of the Square’s storied froyo venders, we have a word of advice: Be the first to add a non-dairy variety to your offerings and break into the lucrative vegan and health nut markets (collectively constituting a not insignificant slice of the city of Cambridge).
We believe it’s important to note once more that frozen yogurt’s burgeoning popularity is due in large part to its healthy aura—it straddles the divide between breakfast and dessert. And while, broadly speaking, we acknowledge the importance of making healthy choices, we worry that Cambridge residents might represent the other extreme. We’re fans of froyo. But if Marvin Gaye was right, and it’s true that there “ain’t nothing like the real thing,” we’d encourage even the most ardent of froyo devotees to enjoy a good old-fashioned ice cream cone every once in a while.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I grew up with Michael Bloomberg as my grandparents grew up with Franklin Roosevelt. He took office when I was seven years old, a few months after 9/11. And like FDR, he stayed on for an extra term. His name was ubiquitous—the signature on a proclamation, a line on the top of a school announcement, a synonym for power and wealth, an imprecation. To be raised in Bloomberg’s New York meant to define yourself in terms of the man, and reminiscence is inescapable as he prepares to leave office at the end of the year.
I hated him, and most people in Rockaway, Queens felt the same. We lived on the edge of the outer boroughs, 40 minutes into Lower Manhattan by car and an hour-and-a-half away by subway. Bloomberg was always booed at the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade. My father thought the mayor only cared about people who lived in “the city.” My mother remarked that municipal services had been better under Rudy Giuliani. Bloomberg was no Giuliani, and nothing like Ed Koch, that irascible, ideal-type Jew Yorker who had endeared himself to white ethnics with straight talk and a hard line on riots.
A socialist of the rural idiot variety, I called Bloomy a neoliberal, a plutocrat, “used to issuing orders on high and ruling by imperial diktat from City Hall.” FDR’s speech before the 1936 Democratic National Convention, with its colorful denunciations of “economic royalism,” resonated with me. “Those who tilled the soil no longer reaped the rewards which were their right. The small measure of their gains was decreed by men in distant cities...And as a result the average man once more confronts the problem that faced the Minute Man.”
As I matured in Bloomberg’s city, the populist rage subsided. My neighbors were right. Congestion pricing was a regressive tax on outer borough residents. There were perhaps too many bike lanes and road closures, too little understanding of what white ethnics in Brooklyn and Queens valued.
Now I had my own stuff to grouse about, though. Bloomberg and Joel Klein, the longtime chancellor of city schools, were destroying public education, opening charters, and trying to bust the teachers’ union, which I defended for reasons of culture and ideology. I was also repulsed by the heavy-handed tactics employed by the NYPD during the occupation of Zuccotti Park and its still-more-troubling stop-and-frisk policy.
Critical as I still am, there have been times I have been proud to call Michael Bloomberg my mayor. After Virginia Tech, Aurora, and Newtown, he strongly advocated anti-gun violence measures, bankrolling an effort that might have succeeded absent the cravenness of a few senators. New York became a leader in public health under his tenure, banning trans fats and smoking in bars and restaurants, a legislative push supplemented by a campaign to encourage exercise and expand access to nutritional food. Bloomberg recognized early on the threat of climate change, developing a plan for the city’s future in a world of rising tides, a decision that seems especially wise after Hurricane Sandy.
Last month, Democratic primary voters rebuked Bloomberg, handing Bill de Blasio the Democratic mayoral nomination. Characterizing the Bloomberg years as a time of widening economic inequality, de Blasio is an avowed social democrat, promising affordable housing starts, cooperation with labor, an end to stop-and-frisk, and a fresh look at education reform.
Even as de Blasio embraces different priorities, he would do well to emulate Bloomberg’s managerial style, a technocratic, results-oriented approach whose success is hard to deny. Usually stingy with their praise, most people I have talked to back in Rockaway have applauded the city’s response to Sandy, which has gotten residents back in their homes.
Left-wingers are justified in their hue and cry against the wealth gap that has opened ever wider in the past 12 years. Yet I think it a mistake to ascribe too much agency to the mayor. New York does not set the rules of the global marketplace, and it is limited in what it can do to redistribute the income accrued by neoliberal elites in a cosmopolitan city. While Bloomberg had no interest in altering the trends of the past three decades, I doubt he would have made consierable progress had he tried.
The political decline and geographical shrinkage of white ethnics is similarly hard to reverse, the product of Jewish assimilation, Italian and Irish movement to the suburbs, and the erosion of the city's manufacturing base.
My grandparents' old Brooklyn neighborhoods, Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill, are now hipster and yuppie hotspots. New York is vitality, and vitality is change. Come January, Bloomy will learn of his own impermanence.

Before today, I had never visited Boston. I’d been living within a two-mile radius—with Trader Joe’s as my southern border, the football stadium as my western border, and a jumble of Harvard buildings and community residences constituting my northern and eastern borders. I spent the majority of my time wandering through Cambridge. Although I kept trying to get lost, I always managed to find Mass. Ave. one way or another.
Today, however, with a jam-packed itinerary in hand, I decided to hop on the southbound M2 shuttle and explore the heart of Boston, the place where, for months, I’d been claiming to attend school but had never actually been to. To see what I could swipe into outside of the Yard, I decided to do all this without spending any money. How far could my Harvard ID and a Charlie Card take me?
The first stop on my Boston expedition was Fenway Street, to see the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The collection ranged from the watercolor works of John Singer Sargent to the Renaissance masterpieces of Raphael. The best part about my visit? As a Harvard student, my admission was free.
The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum’s center is an open-air courtyard filled with classical sculptures and ancient plants like a Chabo Hiba bonsai tree dating back to 1787. Three stories of dimly-lit showrooms surround the courtyard, and each room has a different theme such as the Titian Room, or the Dutch room.
I shuffled in with a colorful group—two sagging, tattooed teenage boys, a gaggle of chatty French women, a crying toddler and her weary mother, and a quiet, stone-faced couple. In a sense, we were a metaphor for the museum itself—an intermingling of cultures and backgrounds—but I hadn’t thought so highly of them at the time, mostly because they seemed to always stand in front of me when I was trying to view nude male torsos.
I then viewed mummified heads in the Egyptian Gallery at the Museum of Fine Arts, just a four minute walk away. The gallery was empty and quiet, and while I stared at the fragile head of Governor Djehutynakht, a museum guard approached me from behind and exclaimed: “Now, don’t go losing your head!”
Slightly terrified and a little weirded out, I backed out of the gallery only to overhear an old woman whisper to her friend, “My head is spinning with abstract art.” After visiting two museums in four hours, my head was spinning too. I couldn’t handle any more art, so I headed to Copley Square.
I still didn’t understand how to navigate subway systems or buses, but somehow I managed to take the Green Line to Copley Square without paying. Signs reading “Pay your fare, it’s only fair” were plastered everywhere at the MFA station. Maybe I felt a little bit guilty (or lucky?), but four hours into my Boston adventure, I still hadn’t spent any money.
Upon arrival, I headed over to the Copley Square farmer’s market to try some fresh goat cheese and Pink Lady apples. It was rainy and overcast, but the famous Copley Square merchants were not to be deterred, and they let me have a couple of samples. Not enough, however, to prevent me from leaving and heading towards Frog Pond.
Frog Pond is the setting of, what my mom tells me, was my favorite childhood novel, “Make Way for Ducklings.” Because I was in the area, I knew I had to visit.
En route to the famous “Make Way for Ducklings” statue in the Boston Public Garden, I met a man who was smoking a large cigar and feeding dozens of ducks bits of grain and bread. He invited me to take a handful of his “homemade” duck feed (gratuitement!) and I sat in the grass with my hand extended, feeling little duckbills nibbling on my fingers. I thanked the man for the feed, and after I found the long line of bronze ducklings, I took a picture in front of the statue, which I sent to my assumedly teary eyed mom.
As the sky grew darker and I started feeling tired after a day of walking, I decided to cross the street to watch a few kids practice Quidditch in a park. On the other side of the park, a group of men was playing kickball, and one kick narrowly missed my head. After that harrowing experience, I decided to return home. It was nice seeing Boston, but I could watch Quidditch in the MAC Quad.
Somehow, in spite of the odds, and the fact that I never took Primitive Navigation, I made it back to the Yard. My first trip to Boston was a success, and I can only expect the same from my next challenge: New York City.

When I say I’m from New Orleans, I really mean 40 miles north of the city, in Covington, Louisiana.
In 1832, a reporter from New Orleans spent the weekend in the piney woods of my hometown and summarized the trip as follows: “Saw a beautiful girl, and that is all, umph, no society here.”
The intervening centuries, too, have conspired to keep Covington as a historical footnote. The train immortalized in the disastrous 1896 Supreme Court decision upholding segregation, Plessy v. Ferguson, was in fact headed to Covington, and Lee Harvey Oswald attended middle school in town. More recently, we have upped our cache, serving as a stand-in for Gloucester, Massachusetts in the Lifetime film “The Pregnancy Pact,” about that group of 16-year-olds who made exactly what the title implies.
Naturally, I spent much of the first 18 years of my life planning my escape. In high school, my best friend and I spent hours developing elaborate visions of our futures—the wall of degrees that would appear above our overflowing book cases, decorated with trinkets from our travels around the world, and the attractive, cultured friends who would materialize along with the rest.
But we also spent a lot of time casting pity on the people around us, on those who were all too happy to be born and raised in suburbia, who would inarguably live their best years in Covington and die there too. Our special scorn was reserved for the classmates we called the Taylor Swift Girls. They were the ones who got sad about football players breaking their hearts and copied and pasted lyrics into their Facebook statuses, who wore a lot of Abercrombie and got blonde highlights at some point in freshman year because they figured out that boys liked blondes better. They were the kind of girls who would make references to “daddy’s pick-up truck” casually and often in any conversation.
When I first boarded the plane to Boston, I knew that I had left the Taylor Swift Girls behind in Covington forever. But in the three years since I defected from the suburbs, a dark reality has begun to creep its way out of the depths of my soul and make itself known.
I’m a Taylor Swift fan.
I resisted for most of my freshman year, but after hearing my roommates play her songs over and over again, I was finally worn down. I know every word to every track on her four studio albums. I still think she’s a little bit crazy and way too obsessed with the ideas of marriage and children for someone her age, but I have to admit that there’s something about her music that gets me, something in that three minutes and 20 seconds that’s the perfectly crafted pop song, some reflective surface that sends all your feelings of giddiness or sadness back at you.
My sophomore year, my roommate had her car shipped here from Colorado because she had to get over to MIT every morning at 6 a.m. for ROTC. A pair of humongous Russian men drove it cross-country, and we met them late one night in September and handed over $700 in cash.
I remember that night vividly for the ritual that it began: Every couple of weeks, we head to the Target in Watertown to stock up on toothpaste, store-brand fruit snacks, and other necessities that CVS hawks for three times their actual price. When we go, I make sure I’m the one sitting shotgun on the way back, so that I can be in control of the radio. On the ride home from Watertown we can usually get through six or seven songs. The first few on Top 40 radio, then my roommate’s favorite country station, but as we turn onto Mt. Auburn Street, I switch off the radio and let the disc changer rotate—and for two years now, our Taylor CD holding the first slot, the opening chords of “Mine” play over the speakers.
“You were in college, working part time waiting tables/ Left a small town, never looked back/ I was a flight risk with a fear of falling/ Wonder why we bother with love if it never lasts…” We sing as loudly as we want as we pass by Tasty Burger, the Lampoon, Tommy’s. We always see people we know, sometimes almost hit them in the crosswalks. But they never notice us. When we’re inside of the car, we’re too out of place, not part of the routine they’re used to.
It’s strange, though, how you can become accustomed to just about anything. Over the past three years, I’ve gotten the hang of the pedestrian life, of disregarding the blinking signs at crosswalks and forging ahead anyway, sure that the anonymous drivers will stop in time. But for me, growing up in a place like Covington means being in the car is first nature.
When I left home, I was convinced that I was headed where I actually belonged, where I could so easily meld with the crowds as they passed down the city’s streets. But when I’m in the car, I’m filled with a kind of comfort that makes me realize that I haven’t fully escaped from the suburbs. There’s a lot more of the Taylor Swift Girls in me than I ever would have been willing to admit three years ago. I was born and raised on a farm and I’ve spent—begrudgingly, but still—countless hours in my own father’s pick-up truck. I will never, ever, ever copy and paste lyrics into my Facebook status, but I understand the disappointment that comes with having feelings for someone who will always like blondes better. I know the desire to let the world know who hurt you and to make that person pay for what’s been broken. And sometimes there’s nothing like a saccharine country-crossover pop song with banjos, soaring guitars, and the voice of a girl who could’ve been from Covington to remind me of home, of what I can’t quite leave behind.
Or maybe I’ve just been listening to too much Taylor Swift.

“Don’t write an article about this,” a representative of the Happiness Project told me, handing me a free extra-large t-shirt. It was a bribe. I took it.
It all started when I heard that the Harvard Happiness Project was throwing a school-wide “Nap Attack” in the Science Center Plaza. What exactly is a Nap Attack? I had no idea, but judging from the title, I assumed it involved a mix of sleeping in public spaces and mild violence. As a journalist, it was my duty to find out and inform the people. I also wanted free stuff.
According to the information on the Facebook event page, napping improves health, alertness, and performance. A whopping crowd of 29 people were confirmed on the Facebook page, potentially 38 if all nine “maybe’s” attended. And seeing as the Happiness Project only guaranteed pillows to the first 20 people, I got to the Science Center Plaza early to beat the crowd.
It had been sunny all week, yet from the hours of one to two on Friday, the sky was overcast, clouds full of the impending sense of rain: perfect weather for a nap outside. However, when I got there at one, no one was napping in the plaza. One girl looked like she was sleeping, but then the Callbacks started performing in front of the giant chess board and she left.
I was about to give up on the event and go for my seventh coffee of the day, but then I saw them: four students holding pillows and quarter sheet fliers. “Nap Attack” had begun.
They handed one girl a flier with the list of unofficial napping spaces at Harvard. Surprisingly, the Science Center Plaza was not one of them. Nor was the space below the Bon Me Food Truck, which I also thought might be well insulated.
“Wow, Annenberg has a basement?” one girl asked, reading the guide.
“Yeah, but you should come nap outside,” a rep from the Happiness Project urged.
“Naw,” she said pointing to Weld, “I’ll just go nap in my room.”
As students stormed past “Nap Attack,” eager to get to section on time or not drool publicly, I started to think that trying to get Harvard students to nap outside was hopeless. But I was happy. This meant that I had more beanbags to myself, and if I hadnt been so hyper from all the coffee, I might have even tried to sleep on them.
Despite my attempts to blend in with the crowd, I stood out. My open laptop and eagerness to announce that I was writing an article gave me away. It also didn’t help that the crowd was four people.
“The event’s cancelled,” a rep said, trying to dissuade me from fulfilling my journalist duties. “Don’t write an article.” Yet as she said it, a group of three ended up on the beanbag chairs. The event was picking up. Perhaps I was wrong to be so skeptical; maybe Harvard student(s) could nap. “Nap Attack” would go on.
And then it started pouring.

Grad school for academics, Goldman for bankers, McKinsey for consultants—all of these post-grad paths are well trod by Harvard alums looking to jump-start high-powered careers right out of college. Another default option is often Teach For America, a selective organization that places 11,000 corps members in teaching positions across the country, promising a chance to explore education, leadership, and public service. But TFA’s methods and results have long generated controversy: Is TFA the panacea for socioeconomic inequality as some say, or are the corps members’ stress and sleep deprivation all for naught?
The Atlantic furthered the debate over TFA’s effectiveness two weeks ago with an op-ed titled “I Quit Teach for America.” In the article, writer Olivia Blanchard explains her reasons for withdrawing from TFA after one year instead of the expected two. Blanchard paints TFA as naïve, unrealistic, and wasteful at best, irresponsible, negligent, and harmful at worst—and despite feeling initially guilty, she is later relieved after resigning from the program.
With so many Harvard students and affiliates pursuing Teach for America, FM wondered how our own TFA crowd would respond to Blanchard’s allegations.
Prepared to Teach?
To begin with, Blanchard reports feeling completely unprepared after participating in TFA’s five-week training program. Rather than being offered concrete skills for future use in the classroom, she was disillusioned upon discovering that the program instead inculcated its corps members with what she describes as “a sea of jargon, buzzwords, and touchy-feely exercises.”
Michael, a recent Harvard College grad and current second-year TFA participant who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he was violating his local TFA office’s press policy, has considered dropping out but plans to honor his two-year commitment. Like Blanchard, he felt unprepared for real teaching after TFA’s training program, which he said included too few hours of training, during which he was teaching too few students.
Conversely, Kevin A. Lee, a student at the Graduate School of Education who completed his TFA tenure this past spring, found the training program brief but effective in preparing him for the challenges ahead. He feels that the tools that served him best as a teacher were not the hard skills of classroom strategy but rather lifelong personal and character-based qualities such as perseverance, empathy, and communication.
Brian ‘13, a former Kirkland House resident and current first-year TFA corps member who was granted anonymity because he feared that his standing within the organization would be negatively affected, absorbed valuable lessons from his trial-by-fire TFA training class of 34 South Phoenix eighth graders this summer.
“Did I learn everything I would have liked to in those five weeks about teaching? No, but like most everyone I talked to, I had no illusions that I would,” he explained by email.
Another current corps member, H. Louise Hindal ’12, says that after her summer training, she “definitely felt prepared.” While acknowledging that five weeks is short, she says that “there is no way to learn to be a teacher without being in the classroom... Your first year is overwhelming as a teacher no matter what.”
Finding a Community?
Feeling undertrained and thrown into an Atlanta public school, Blanchard struggled with needy and unruly students, resentment between corps members and other teachers, and a lack of support from TFA itself.
However, the Harvard graduates and students interviewed almost unanimously report that within their placement schools, corps members and non-TFA teachers enjoyed mutually-supportive relationships.
TFA alumnus Lee feels that potential problems finding community would be “personally-driven, not TFA-driven.”
Brian wrote, “In fact, as the school year started, one of the comments me and a fellow TFA corps member frequently made was that we had too much support.”
Michael, who has considered dropping out, acknowledged that TFA provides some support for its corps members. However, echoing Blanchard’s concerns, he has found these resources limited by bureacracy within the organization.
Is TFA Worth It?
Blanchard questions whether or not TFA benefits students, corps members, or the educational system at large.
While many TFA teachers feel that they performed poorly their first year, and some like Michael even think they let down their students, most cite huge gains in the second year of the program—which Blanchard and other early dropouts miss out on. Although TFA does not release its corps member retention rates, early withdrawal seems anecdotally common.
Having transitioned to her second year, Hindal is working as much as ever, putting in 70-80 hour workweeks, but reports that year two is “amazingly different.”
Lee echoed Hindal’s sentiments, adding, “The worst day of your second year is still better than the best day of your first year.”
Lee, who majored in business, heard about TFA’s compelling mission during his senior year in college. TFA’s goals of improving access to education resonated with his own experience in Chicago’s South Side public school system, and after teaching math in Atlanta, he has swapped his business aspirations for a career in education.
Lee believes that TFA plays a vital role in drawing bright and motivated young people into education, where their talents and hard work are desperately needed. He has stories of many other corps members who, like him, are surprised to find themselves still passionately invested in teaching after TFA ends, which Lee feels is “hugely beneficial” to the educational system as a whole.
Brian wrote that, “regardless of where TFA corps members move onto after their time teaching, they do walk away with a better sense of the problems in the education system in the US.”
He added, “Whether they turn that into a congressional campaign or merely a career on a future child’s PTA board, I think that the knowledge is invaluable.”
Should You Do TFA?
While aware of TFA’s drawbacks, many Harvard students continue to look forward to joining the corps.
L. Fay Alexander ’14 has weighed criticisms like Blanchard’s but plans to begin a TFA teaching position next year in Oklahoma, where she hopes to focus especially on the lack of educational opportunities faced by Native American students.
She also won’t be relying solely on TFA training: Alexander has already gotten her feet wet as a student teacher with Harvard’s Undergraduate Teacher Education Program.
Alexander says she wouldn’t have signed up for TFA if she hadn’t first done UTEP. But what’s different and enticing about TFA for her and other young people, she says, is the opportunity to work closely and bond with a community of teachers aspiring to shape the future of American education.
“We haven’t found the perfect way to educate or teach someone to be a teacher,” Alexander said. But TFA at least “prepares someone to put in the necessary hard work,” she added.
Prior to Blanchard’s Atlantic article, TFA dropout Noam Hassenfeld ’12 published a piece on PolicyMic  about why he believes potential TFA recruits ought to consider the less glamorous City Year instead.
Hassenfeld writes that TFA replaces current teachers with young college graduates unsure if they even want to end up teaching.  By contrast, City Year offers teaching assistant positions throughout the country—firsthand experience in a lower-stress and lower-consequence environment.
In an online message, Hassenfeld explained that his big-picture concerns go beyond those of TFA participants’ personal experience. He believes that TFA harms our educational system by promoting school privatization, disrupting teachers’ unions, and driving down their salaries. He also considers the education of the students that TFA is trying to serve to be paramount.
“Most significantly, [TFA is] providing at-risk students with unqualified teachers that largely leave the classroom before they become quality teachers,” he wrote.
In light of Blanchard’s article and the reactions of Harvard’s TFA cohort, it’s clear that there are no guarantees in a TFA experience.  An evaluation of TFA’s efficacy depends on the measure used—be it closing the achievement gap, attracting talent to the teaching profession, focusing national attention on educational disparities, or giving corps members the best chance to succeed. What still remains to be seen is whether dissatisfaction on the ground indicates a failure of TFA or unrealistic expectations for what the organization can ultimately achieve.
Alhough Blanchard’s cautionary tale may not deter those most intent on a teaching career, it may certainly  cause the less-committed to think twice.

Final clubs for Harvard men date back to 1791, but final clubs for women at Harvard didn’t emerge until a full 200 years later, in 1991. Though less institutionalized and established than their male counterparts, female final clubs have significantly impacted Harvard’s social scene in their two decades of existence by giving women more social options and creating more social spaces controlled by women. FM investigates the beginnings of the female final clubs, the visions that the founders had for their new organizations, and the challenges that the clubs have faced as they look to become a permanent presence in the Harvard social scene.
WOMEN IN MEN'S CLUBS?
 In 1976, two women were punched by the Delta Upsilon fraternity, a group that later merged with the Fly Club. They were refused membership. The women later learned that several influential alums had threatened to withdraw their financial support of the D.U. if women were admitted to the organization.
In 1978, just two years later, eight women attended the D.U.’s punch dinner dressed in tuxedos and three-piece suits.
According to a 2004 Crimson article that investigated the episode, the women’s presence in the club provoked quite a dramatic reaction: The club steward locked himself in a room with all of the food because he “was so angry about the female intrusion.” According to the article, the D.U.’s president at the time, John A. “Kras” Krasznekewicz ’79, confronted his fellow club member R. Stewart Shofner ’79 who had invited the girls, saying, “I thought you were my friend. How could you betray me like this?”
"We didn’t do it completely to goose people,” said D.U. member Stephen A. Kowl ’79, referring to the decision to invite the girls. Kowl, who had extended an invitation to the women along with Shofner, said that the purpose of welcoming the women into the club was to “lampoon the old, foolish ways. We wanted to have a good laugh, while still making a serious point.”
Challenges to the all-male final club scene continued in 1987 when Lisa J. Schkolnick ’88 filed a complaint against the Fly Club to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. Schkolnick claimed that the male-only admissions policy of the Fly violated Massachusetts General Law, specifically a chapter that describes discrimination by sex as a punishable offense. Though the lawsuit was unsuccessful, it brought the exclusivity of Harvard’s final club scene to the forefront of gender equality discussions.
THE BEGINNINGS
For much of Harvard’s history, male-only final clubs dominated the social scene at the College. The clubs were historic and established, they owned their own spaces, and they threw great parties. Women’s clubs broke into the Harvard social scene more recently, emerging alongside the men’s clubs to create opportunities for women to host parties of their own and forge close friendships and strong networks.
The Bee, started in 1991, was the first female-only social club at Harvard. Its group of 14 founding members adopted the name from a “sewing bee” group of Cambridge women that was started during the Civil War.
Former Bee President Deborah E. Lipson ’95 said that the club “never felt like a sorority.” She went on to explain, in a 1998 Crimson article, that the club “was more a group of women who were looking for other interesting women to talk to."
Another final club for women did not emerge until 2000, when the Isis appeared on the scene. Hoping to be a women’s social club with a more open admissions process than its predecessor, the Isis club’s primary objective was to foster friendships between women.
“Same-sex clubs have many advantages for building friendships,” former acting president and co-punchmaster Sarah C. Geisler ’03 told the Crimson in 2001. “We wanted to give women this option.”
In the club’s formation, the founders had discussed whether or not the club would have a specific cause, but they ultimately decided against it, instead prioritizing “looking for girls who want to have a good time,” according to a 2001 Crimson interview.
The next female final club that emerged, the Sablière Society, did have a fairly specific cause and mission. Started in 2002, the Sablière hoped to take advantage of artistic and cultural opportunities in Boston.
Sablière co-founder Brooke L. Chavez ’04 explained the club’s individuality. “We’re not advocating a keg in a small basement, but rather cocktails on the Common or wine at the MFA,” Chavez told the Crimson in 2002.
Brittany J. Moorefield '04, another Sablière co-founder, told FM that the formation of the club was partially a reaction to Harvard’s social climate and gender dynamics at the time. “Basically there weren’t very many women’s groups on campus, whereas there were lots of final clubs and fraternities,” Moorefield said. “There were a lot of options that were exclusively for men.”
Moorefield found that the reactions to the new women’s club were supportive. “I think people thought it was really cool and avant-garde in the sense that a female final club hadn’t been started in a while,” she said. “It was a group of really sociable girls so we threw some great parties.”
The Pleiades was also founded in 2002. Meant to be an intermediary between a sorority and final club, Pleiades was named for the seven sisters in Greek mythology known for their beauty.
In a Crimson article in 2002, Pleiades Co-Founder Tanya F. Perkins '04 explained that she wanted to branch out and bring a new group of girls together. “I invited acquaintances I had talked to in the dining hall but never gone out with on a Saturday night,” Perkins said of starting the club.
The most recent addition to Harvard’s female club offerings is La Vie Club, founded in 2008. Even though four female final clubs had been formed already, La Vie founder Oluwadara A. Johnson ’10 still felt there was a discrepancy between male and female social outlets on campus.
“On a cold winter day in January 2008, I decided it was time to take an active step towards bridging the gender inequality gap that exists in the Harvard social scene,” Johnson told The Crimson in 2010.
But female final clubs were not the only option women had for non-Greek social clubs on campus. The Seneca, created in 1999, was an anomaly among women’s social clubs: It was neither a club nor a sorority, and it established an open application process.
According to a Crimson article from 2000, the Seneca was originally intended to be a sister organization to the Delphic Club, on the premise that "men have power and influence on campus, and they could be our greatest allies," according to a 2000 comment to The Crimson by Patricia Ivonne Thompson '01, the Seneca's then co-president-elect. But the partnership with the Delphic ultimately fell through, and women’s advocacy became central to the group’s mission.
“We hope to be a service to women,” former Seneca co-president Sandra B. Seru '01 told the Crimson in 2000. “We see ourselves as a resource.”
FINDING A HOME
The female clubs’ determination to establish themselves as leaders in the predominantly male-run social scene came with logistical difficulties, as the clubs lacked alumni support and the funds to acquire their own building. Raising money and finding an available space in Harvard Square proved to be challenging.
“Men have had hundreds of years to acquire space, to acquire status,” Ilana J. Sichel ’05, former co-president of the Radcliffe Union of Students, told the Crimson in 2003. “They’re lucky in that they have these opportunities, these spaces that their predecessors have carved out for them. And women just don’t.”
In a 1998 Crimson article, Bee Club member Medora S. Bross ’00 recalled her experience visiting a sorority at Dartmouth: “It was so great to see women controlling the liquor, kicking people out of the party and playing pool instead of just watching the guys play pool. It was good to see women in control," she said.
The Isis became the first of the female social clubs to have their own space when they leased an apartment on Trowbridge Street in 2002. They now use space in the Owl Club’s building on 30 Holyoke St., which they started leasing in 2008.
For the Bee, the effort of acquiring a building was “ongoing and persistent,” former Bee president Deborah E. Lipson ’95 said in a 1998 Crimson article. They eventually started leasing the Fly Club’s property at 45 Dunster St.
The problem of finding adequate social space for female final clubs and social clubs persists through today, as the clubs are still young and Harvard Square real estate continues to be costly and hard to come by. In 2010, the Chabad, an orthodox Jewish center, offered $6 million to buy the 45 Dunster Street property owned by the Fly Club. Until the women’s clubs have enough money for a well-located space, leasing from male clubs seems like the most viable property option.

“In the mood of Plato’s distich it bids farewell to a land whose long familiar contours have ceased to stir creative thought: it bids farewell—and sounds the hunting horn.” - Varian M. Fry, 1927
So went the opening lines of the first issue of Harvard’s newest addition to the literary scene, The Hound & Horn: A Harvard Miscellany. Lincoln E. Kirstein ’29, who would go on to found the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet, had joined forces with Varian M. Fry ’31 to create an alternative to existing options on campus. While the magazine was short-lived, lasting only until 1934, it would be one of the first to open literary dialogue on campus to the avant-garde, ensuring that its resonance would be felt beyond the 1930s.
THE HOUND AND HORN
Kirstein teamed up with Fry, who would later become known for his efforts to help French intellectuals escape Vichy France, to combat what they saw as a lackluster literary scene embodied mainly by The Harvard Advocate. As Fry explained in a 1934 article published in the Advocate, they understood the organization to be more of a club than a literary publication. They had embarked on this process with the goal of creating another Criterion, the quarterly literary magazine founded by T.S. Eliot that first published “The Waste Land.”
In its first issue, The Hound & Horn promised “spontaneous and sincere coöperation of all,” assuring that it would “announce no ‘boards’ and will conduct no ‘competitions.’” Such an egalitarian sentiment was meant to forge an intellectual community and capture the interest of the university at large. The editors promised that the magazine would constitute a “fresh medium for creative expression to all members of the University who desire it.” For the seven short years of its existence, the magazine would publish a variety of works, including poetry, fiction, book reviews, art and photography, and critical essays.
The first issue opened with an obscure citation of Plato in Greek, the quotation to which Fry refers above. In his book, “The Hound & Horn: The History of A Literary Quarterly,” Leonard Greenbaum sheds light on the quotation’s provenance, providing a translation by J. W. Mackail: “Farewell ever beautiful fatherland, Eretria, Farewell Athens, Neighbors of Euboea, Farewell, friendly sea.” Fry explained his esoteric choice by claiming that he and Kirstein sought to free themselves from 19th-century influences, and from what they saw as the Advocate’s staid conservatism. They sought instead to embrace the new modernist world of Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce, Stein, Eliot, and their contemporaries.
Directly below Plato, Fry placed the first five bars of Brahms’ Horn Trio, proclaiming a new age of literary publication at Harvard.
THE SECOND MOVEMENT
The first issues featured commentaries on Harvard news, including a piece on a new policy about reading period, which had been lengthened to two to three weeks for the completion of final assignments. The editors were skeptical: They denounced specific research topics as limiting and detrimental to intellectual freedom, the ideal Harvard man’s education.
During the first two years of the quarterly the discourse within its pages gradually began to shift to a broader range of discussion. Kirstein’s vision for the magazine encompassed the literary world in general. Thanks to his family contacts, the magazine was already being distributed at six stores in Cambridge, along with locations in New York, Princeton, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and London. Kirstein wanted to strike “A Harvard Miscellany” from The Hound & Horn’s title in order to reach out to non-Harvard writers and broaden their scope. Fry, meanwhile, preferred to cleave more closely to University-based topics, but Kirstein had the capital to back his vision in ways Fry could not. Fry parted ways with the magazine in 1929, just two years after the founding.
In many ways, Kirstein’s ambitions seemed to bear fruit. T. S. Eliot was the first major name to appear in The Hound & Horn, contributing an essay to the magazine in 1929 entitled “Second Thoughts about Humanism.” The list of later contributors seems to be lifted straight from the modernist canon: Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens all appeared in the magazine’s pages. Stevens’ poem “Autumn Refrain” was published side by side with an essay on his poetry by Richard Palmer Blackmur, a regular contributor from the quarterly’s conception to its demise who would later become a well-known critic and poet.
SILENCE OF THE HORN
During the few years that it was active, the magazine refrained from aligning itself with any particular literary or political movement. While Kirstein did lean left, the magazine once attacked The New Republic with a parody, fabricating a quote from The New Republic’s then-treasurer, Robert Hallowell: “We don’t need an Ivy Lee to sell Communism to America: We need a New Republic to sell America to America.”
In any case, the actual size of The Hound & Horn’s audience was at best uncertain. Kirstein had long struggled to recruit commercial sponsors, and the rumors of the magazine’s demise were already in circulation when the editors announced the discontinuation of The Horn & Hound in its summer 1934 issue.
The story of The Hound & Horn, begun when two underclassmen broke off from the ruthless social and literary hierarchy of Harvard undergraduate publications and pursued their own course, ultimately faded away into the history of the many short-lived literary publications then flourishing throughout the country (Greenbaum counts over fifty in his analyis). The Advocate itself was perhaps inspired by the new gap in the avant-garde, publishing a controversially racy story by Henry Miller in 1935. And the early relationship between Fry and Kirstein would not entirely end so soon. Fry would end up marrying Kirstein’s sister Eileen, keeping the spirit of the time alive even after the horn ceased its call.

Around the time I first heard about feminism, my best high school guy friends came up with a scintillatingly descriptive nickname for me: Tits McGee. To be fair, we were 16 and didn’t know any better. Ron Burgundy’s mustachioed crudeness exemplified humoristic finesse in our eyes. My friends didn’t think anything of it. What’s worse—I didn’t think anything of it.
The chest bit soon became a running gag in our friend group because I seemed to be able to take it well. A year into the amicable teasing, a new copy of Time Magazine caught my eye as I picked through my parents’ correspondence. Its headline read, “The 50 Year Anniversary of The Pill: So small. So powerful. And so misunderstood.” Probably projecting myself onto the bookends of the post-colon phrasing, I eagerly flipped to the issue’s cover story.
Soon enough, I paused on a short paragraph that set my San Juan hometown-sense ablaze. In 1956, through an initiative spearheaded by Margaret Sanger, birth control activist, Harvard scientists Gregory Pincus and John Rock began holding clinical trials of the pill in Puerto Rico. Because testing the pill as a contraceptive was illegal at the time, the circumscribed Puerto Rico was the ideal petri dish. The researchers probably thought: “A country with no de jure anti-birth control laws and hundreds of women searching for better health resources? Sign. Us. Up.”
The article failed to mention how most of the female participants were poor, uneducated, and marginalized because of their race. While the pill was found to be “100 percent effective,” 17 percent of the female participants reported side effects that were not thoroughly investigated. It seemed to me like the  researchers’ priority was to make the pill accessible to U.S. markets as soon as possible.
Sanger would afterwards be heralded as an “ardent feminist” who just so happened to be on board with eugenics and, frankly, unsexy interpretations of sexuality (see “What Every Girl Should Know,” an ode to the “dangers” of masturbation). My poorly-informed teenage self was baffled, outraged, and caught off-guard.
Initially, I wondered why Sanger’s feminist vision only favored a very particular group of people. I was unsettled by how, in this case, endorsing the feminist cause meant that some groups, no matter how much they needed support, would be oppressed to the point of negligence. The thought kept me going. I had to do something, but first I had to re-examine my own life, starting with the most insignificant interactions. Maybe I was doing my gender an injustice by being cool when others playfully put down the female body. Well, to keep it short, duh. I was probably not supposed to laugh at my friends’ jokes if I was always the butt (or boobs) of them.
Before I could try to work with this newfound consciousness, the college application process revved up and I was forced to ignore real life for a bit. Graduation then swept my previous doubts away, only to have them thrown back at me when 90 percent of my Harvard classmates frequently used terms like “problematic” and “social construct” in section. I took my first Women’s and Gender Studies class my freshman spring, and, I swear, every class sounded like this:
“Hey, Ms., NOW’s the time to dismantle the patriarchy. Stop being a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, do away with that stiletto feminism, and take on the intersectionality that connects Pocahontas and La Malinche with the likes of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Virginia Woolf, and Margaret Cho.”
If you got every reference mixed in there, congratulations. You’re a multi-issue feminist and you can’t un-see problems with how our society deals with race, gender, and sexuality. If you didn’t, welcome to the chunk of humanity that should. For too long, I mistakenly assumed that being a feminist meant that everyone within the cause had to have the same outlook. Going into WGS here exposed me to a radically different vocabulary than what I was used to, one that showed me just how difficult and diverse the issues we discuss can be. You can imagine how complicated things get when they leave the cushiness of a classroom.
Though it took me a while to acknowledge, being a feminist begins with acceptance. It begins with accepting your faults so you can see larger societal patterns that are detrimental to a particular sector. It progresses with the thought of allowing everyone, female, male, or whatever, to have a choice. That choice should be one full of dignity and respect. It continues with little things like “My eyes are up here” and ends with important elements like equal pay and the end of rape culture. While I’m sure I got a couple of scoffs for the end of that sentence, I’m not worried. You’ll come around with time. We’re all thinking. I know I am now. I think, therefore I am, I am, I am a feminist.

On a recent Monday evening, in the fluorescent-lit basement conference room of 54 Dunster Street, the Office of Career Services sponsored “Is Consulting the Right Fit?” Harvard College and Business School alumni, dressed in suits or oxford button-downs with untouched water bottles beside them, took questions and described their careers to an audience of about 20 students.
“Why consulting?” asked Robert B. Niles ’11, a former literature concentrator and former Bain & Company associate who is now a JD/MBA candidate at Harvard. “To this day I can’t really tell you.” “I was deciding between a Ph.D and consulting, and consulting was what I ended up doing. It felt right,” he said, shrugging, as the audience laughed.
A blue-eyed, brown-haired senior toward the back raised his hand to ask how consulting might teach useful skills for someone interested in start-ups. Niles replied that consulting would certainly make a candidate for an existing start-up “that much more valuable.”
“I really just went to ask them particularly about that,” said the student, Jacob D. Roberts ’13-’14, after the event. “I’m interested in consulting, but increasingly I’m interested in working for a start-up after school. I’m trying to decide what route I want to go in.” Niles’s answer was especially helpful, Roberts explained, because the panelists were speaking as individuals rather than on behalf of their companies. Roberts’s main hesitancy about consulting is the possibility of working on a project for months that is then rejected by the client—he sees the start-up culture as more immediately high-impact. But the timeline of senior year recruiting, “heavily skewed” towards finance and consulting, according to Roberts, has prompted him to reconsider his options.
The On-Campus Interview section of the OCS website entitled “Is On-Campus Recruiting for me?” cautions, “Although students often report that it feels like ‘everyone’ is using OCI to find their job or internship, that is not statistically the case.”
But according to last year’s numbers, 39 percent of the senior class does participate in the program. And 18 to 22 percent of the class will consistently enter consulting and finance—a statistic that jumps to almost 30 percent of seniors with jobs lined up by graduation.
These fields obviously encompass a diverse array of jobs and even careers. Still, consulting and finance positions are marketed similarly to Harvard students, they make up the majority of OCI interviews, and, perhaps most tellingly, the discourse on campus tends to consider them as one.
In many ways, it’s not surprising why consulting and finance continue to attract so many Harvard students. They offer prestige, generous compensation, and strong exit options; many students also express a genuine interest in the fields. But beyond the statistics, the constant and at times shrill on-campus conversations around these careers seem to speak to broader anxieties of “selling out,” “buying time,” or diverting passion—even as, for many, it's unclear what that passion might be.
Just over three years ago, as Tercentenary Theatre hissed under 96-degree heat, University President Drew G. Faust told the Class of 2014, “You have an affinity for the exhilarating and sometimes difficult and humbling and disoriented activity of taking risks.” For her bright and bright-eyed audience, now seniors, these risks can seem bigger, and taking them less feasible. Though often seen as safer options than other caeers, finance and consulting jobs entail the same risks of any important choice; they set students down a path with limits of its own.
The OCI Machine
Jared D. Sleeper ’14, a cheerful blond senior from a small town in northern Maine, became interested in investing in middle school. By his junior year at Harvard, he had won the second annual Undergraduate Stock Pitch Competition at Cornell, along with three other classmates.
“I knew I wanted to do [finance] from the beginning,” says Sleeper, grinning at me across the table as the din of Eliot’s dining hall picks up for lunch. There was a point, maybe freshman year, when he questioned his long-term interest: “Is this something that’s making the world a better place?” he asked himself.
“Even though it is helping the world, it’s so intangible and difficult to pin down exactly how, that people sometimes lose sight of that,” says Sleeper, the current co-president of the Harvard Financial Analysts Club. But he ultimately decided that a career in finance could contribute to society, to use his own terms.
Sleeper lights up when talking about his internship in investment research, at a company to which he’ll return after graduation. “Everyone who was there was really committed to making it work, because their self-interests were aligned so much,” says Sleeper.
An economics concentrator, Sleeper hasn’t found a comparable intellectual experience in his classes for the most part, barring a philosophy elective, an unusual outlier. “Everyone was super motivated about philosophy.... Everyone cared deeply.” Pausing, Jared continues, “I feel that way at my job.”
Sleeper thinks that while a passion like his may not be the motivating factor for many Harvard students entering finance, it’s wrong to automatically label those who enter the field as “selling out.”
“I feel like most of the generalized ire that assumes that people are making these decisions for a certain set of reasons is misguided,” he says slowly. “Because you don’t know what someone’s situation is. Because it’s so hard to know people’s motivations unless you know them well.”
Sleeper never fully participated in the recruiting process, as his current employer reached out to him after he won the stock competition last winter. But this tension between “giving back” and “selling out” is, according to the Office for Career Services, a common theme among Harvard students currently going through the recruiting process.
“We had a large investment bank where the recruiter would refer to Harvard students as the ‘save the world’ students,” says Deborah Carroll, who oversees the On-Campus Interview program. “And those were the students going into investment banking.”
Carroll and her colleague, OCS Director Robin Mount, say that they’re very proud of OCI, which results in over 6,000 on-campus interviews each year.“I think it’s one of the top in the country,” says Mount, crossing her legs in a second-floor office chair that looks out onto the windows of the MAC gymnasium.
But both Mount and Carroll acknowledge that there is a sense on campus that they’re not doing enough to steer students to alternative careers, that they welcome OCI employers with open arms while dismissing other paths.
“Everyone thinks that we bring those companies,” Mount says, referring to the large finance and consulting firms. “They call us up. We don’t go after them.”
Carroll adds, “We actually go after the companies that [students] don’t have the impression on campus that we’re doing enough for...that we spend our time and resources visiting in the summer, convincing them that Harvard students are a great hire for them at the entry level.”
This is a hard sell for many of these smaller firms or non-profit organizations, which are often swamped with applications, or don’t have the time or resources to travel to Harvard and court its students. For the 2013-2014 academic year, OCS charged for-profit employers $150 for each interview room and $300 for use of a conference room (non-profit employers were not charged).
OCS holds about 350 programs on campus per year. Many of these are start-up fairs, advertising and non-profit expos, and events for other fields marketed through a multicolored calendar that OCS hands out and posts on its websites. It’s true, though, that the very first events of each year are oriented toward consulting and finance. This week’s events for seniors included panels on international development, Ph.Ds, community health, and marketing—just as first-round OCI interviews for most major firms were winding down. By April, when the social impact expo is held, the rush of fall recruiting is a distant memory for many, and there can be a sense that those who still don’t have a job are scrambling.
“It was nerve-wracking to see everyone getting offers, because their recruiting comes earlier,” says Heidi Lim ’15. Lim went through the summer internship recruiting process herself last year, landing an internship at a tech firm; but according to her, consulting and finance firms hold a privileged position even within OCI in general. “These companies know what they’re doing,” she says. “They do it early so that they get to pick out of everyone, whoever they want.”
Roberts explains that finance and consulting firms “snag top talent” this way. “And then for someone like me who is pretty open between the two...” Roberts trails off, “it’s more attractive to pursue the OCI route—because then you have a job.”
Still, OCS’s efforts to introduce alternative programming have swung too far to the opposite end of the pendulum, according to some students. “They’re not that enthusiastic about people going into business and finance,” says Evan Wu ’14, who has taken advantage of OCS drop-in hours and is currently going through the recruiting process. “I think they spend a lot more time planning events to try to show people other options.”
Though he adds, shrugging, “finance and consulting don’t really need support.”
OCS and OCI directors claim that they’re neutral, that their role is to listen to what students are interested in and help them pursue these interests. “It’s a fabulous opportunity for students,” Mount says of OCI. She pauses, enunciating each word: “for whom that is what they want to do.”
“What we don’t want students to have,” she continues, “is what we call the lemming effect—that just because your roommate’s doing it or your friend [is doing it] that you need to paddle in that direction.”
Andrew, a senior in Leverett House from Poland, who requested that his name be changed because he did not want his comments to impact his own recruiting process, speaks casually and irreverently about this phenomenon as he spreads ketchup on his slice of pizza over dinner. “At Harvard, it’s a choice between finance and consulting,” he says. “Everyone is hyped, even if they have no idea what it really is.”
Why does he think so many students apply? Andrew shrugs: “For names, for money, for experience.” Some people truly want to pursue these careers, he thinks. “If they don’t choose it for a passion, it will turn out during the interview process,” he says. I ask, so those that receive job offers are the ones that should be getting them? He immediately nods.
Avowed interest is obviously just one of many reasons a fifth of Harvard’s class might choose consulting and finance positions each year. “I think anyone would be naïve to say there aren’t some Harvard students choosing finance for reasons other than passion,” says Sleeper.
The pay is one, although several of the students I spoke with claimed that, given the hours, the compensation isn’t as generous as popular thought would have it. According to Sleeper, for instance, a typical hourly wage in finance works out to about as much as a librarian might make. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for ‘education, training, and library occupations’ in 2012 was $22.13; for ‘financial operations’ the median was $30.05.
Still, Sleeper says, “I have friends specifically who are from family backgrounds where that compensation is really meaningful—that will allow them to support their families...and that trumps all other factors.”
For international students, like Andrew, the possibility of remaining in the U.S. after graduation can be appealing. American law requires employers hiring international candidates to file a petition on behalf of the candidate, involving a process of steep fees and heavy paperwork.
Many American companies thus state explicitly that they do not hire international students; those that do tend to be the larger consulting and finance firms, meaning that international students who wish to remain in the U.S. are more likely to attain legal residency by recruiting for these larger and mainly for-profit companies. And according to Andrew, even the companies that do hire international students may privilege Americans, given the hassle and high costs. “I feel like there’s still tacit agreement, where if there were two candidates of the same quality...they would still hire an American candidate,” he says.
Are those who go into these careers selling out? “It’s kind of a frustrating thing for people to perceive it as that,” says Wu. “I think there’s this overwhelming sense that if you go into banking or finance or consulting you’re not doing any good for society—or that you’re doing bad things for society, that you’re a negative value for society.”
“If you think about it,” he continues, “the very fact that these jobs are well-paying jobs implies that they do fulfill some sort of social function.”
Still, all the students I talked to who were entering finance were careful to distinguish between investment banks—which seem to bear the brunt of the stigma— and hedge funds, or private equity, or research. They also took care to underline their own legitimate interest in the field, as revealed by involvement in clubs or groups throughout their time at Harvard.
That students feel the need to do so is perhaps backed by the notion, more or less pervasive depending on with whom you speak, that these careers are a way of buying time rather than selling out. According to The Crimson’s 2013 senior survey, while 15.8 percent of the respondents said they were entering consulting, just .9 percent said they still wanted to be in the field in 10 years; for finance the rates were 15.2 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. That gap may speak to a broader assumption among Harvard seniors about these fields: that they are a way to defer later aspirations, rather than giving up on them entirely.
Step by Step
Tuong Vi Nguyen ’15 has long dreamed of going into foreign diplomacy. Dressed in a sweatshirt and dark jeans, the articulate and even-spoken junior rattles off a long list of the “pre-government” activities she joined upon entering Harvard: Model UN, Model Congress, the IOP, “the usual stuff.”
During her first two years at Harvard, Nguyen spent some time at OCS attempting to determine how best to pursue her interests in government. “The adviser I talked to, she was very straight and honest with me,” she says. “There’s not a lot of people going into these low-level entry jobs, because when you go straight out of college, you do a lot of paper-pushing. You don’t get to talk to the higher-ups.”
Consulting and finance are different, she thinks: “They invest in their graduates.” These two-year stints will be more likely to support her in her later steps, perhaps funding her to go to law school, another goal. They’ll also give her the chance to do something out of her element, something more quantitative, before pursuing her ultimate dreams.
Consulting companies in particular emphasize the broad range of career paths their alumni have taken. The Harvard recruiting managers or coordinators at Boston Consulting Group, Bain & Company, and McKinsey either did not respond or declined to comment on the tracks their alumni take. But many students say that these and similar companies market their positions as two-year jobs after which alumni can go on to do “anything,” from business or law school to non-profit work and government service.
Some veterans, though, question this flexibility. Niles, for instance, cited business school and private equity as the major exit options when asked at the panel to comment on later paths.
Still, says Mount of OCS, “A lot of students think, ‘I’ll build my network.’ It’s a way to get some training and experience and skills that you can take onto your next passion.”
“There are very few people I know who want to be in consulting or finance for the rest of their lives,” says Lim, the senior entering the tech industry. “A lot of people I know don’t necessarily know what they want to do, so they’ll go into consulting. You’ll still be learning—then hopefully figure out what you want to do.”
This path is clearer for some than for others. Chukwuma C. Nwachukwu ’14 came to Harvard confident he’d be pre-med and reasonably certain he’d be a doctor. By talking to older friends in the Black Men’s Forum, where, he says, consulting and banking are “huge,” Nwachukwu began to learn more about business-related positions. Still pre-med, he’s currently recruiting for positions at life-science consulting firms, along with management consulting positions that will allow him to specialize in life-science consulting.
“I’m really into health, really into helping people, really into pharmaceuticals,” he says, “but I’m wondering if I need an M.D. to do that. I guess this experience is going to help me figure that out—seeing different parts of industries, seeing where people with different specialties fit in.”
“And if I do end up being a doctor,” Nwachukwu continues, “I feel like the experience will help a lot—having a business background, being able to manage things.”
For Sleeper, finance is similarly capable of opening doors. “You have that natural progression,” he says. “You have this option of spending two years,” he continues, ticking off his fingers: “making a lot of money, being surrounded by people from your similar background of top-tier liberal arts schools, in cities you generally like, where all your friends are going to be.”
“And at the end of it,” he concludes, “you have that safety valve.”
For consulting and finance, according to Carroll, “You’re not making a career decision, you’re making a job decision. You gain a lot of skills, you meet a lot of people—so you have lots of options,” once the two- or three-year stint is up.
Referring to what many students deem the “optionality” of these jobs, Carroll adds, “And some of that is perception—feeling like if you do other things you won’t have these options. Which, to some extent, is perception versus reality.”
For some, finance and consulting are natural stepping stones on the way to a career they’ve long envisioned. The proliferation of pre-professional groups at Harvard—HFAC, the Veritas Financial Group, the Harvard College Consulting Group, Women in Business—highlights early interest in these fields on campus. “For me and a lot of people,” says Lim of her high school and freshman years, “you hear BCG [Boston Consulting Group]—you don’t know what it is.” These groups, along with summer internships, are sometimes the way to find out what these fields might entail.
But the recruiting process also includes those who have never participated in these clubs or internships. The percentage of the class who accepts an offer from OCI jumps from 13 percent of juniors to 18 percent of seniors, which includes those who accepted a full-time offer from their summer OCI internship.
This fall, there is only one undergraduate course being offered in the Economics Department on finance, Capital Markets, a natural result of Harvard’s emphasis on a liberal arts education. And a not insignificant portion of students going into finance and consulting come from other fields: According to departmental data, 25 percent of history concentrators enter business school, consulting or finance; this figure is 18 percent for English concentrators. In general, then, many enter their senior year at Harvard with a vague interest or knowledge of the recruiting process, but without knowing what these jobs might involve and how much they might enjoy them—or what an ideal alternative career path would even be.
Dreams Deferred? 
W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, an economics tutor in Eliot House, spends much of his time encouraging students to think beyond economics-related career fields. Van Vuuren is a venture capitalist who co-runs the $10 million Experiment Fund from Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and holds a degree from the Graduate School of Design. Raised in South Africa, Van Vuuren tends to speak in fully formed sentences with a barely noticeable lilt to his voice.
“Sadly,” he says, “many students go into consulting and banking because they think it’s a safe bet that gives them transferable skills.”
“But in reality,” Van Vuuren continues, “unless you absolutely love finance or absolutely love the discipline of management consulting, what you often find is that people get on a career ladder that they do not love, that in the end doesn’t really give them the knowledge that they had hoped, in terms of what they’re good at. And they end up coming to grad school with the same questions they came to Harvard with, just a few years later.”
“As in,” he clarifies, “standing at the gates of choice and wondering, ‘Will I follow my passion, or will I defer the day that I do what I love longer?’ because of some seemingly reasonable excuse.”
For Van Vuuren, it’s not about finance or consulting versus jobs in entertainment or the arts. “Some people were meant to do finance,” he says. But those who were not—perhaps the majority—are nudged into them, he thinks, as part of a culture that rewards “gold stars” over truly meaningful work.
“What I’m saying is not crazy,” he says. “If you do ordinary things, you shouldn’t expect extraordinary outcomes. Walking into an on-campus recruiting job that is, arguably, tailored more to the needs of the employer than to the individual—taking that job isn’t, from my perspective, and with rare exceptions, the extraordinary brave act to find your passion.”
Van Vuuren refers often to students’ passions, to their dreams. What about those who have no idea what they’re passionate about? I ask him. “I think the reasonable thing to do,” he replies, “is to try out different things until you know what you’re passionate about.”
“It’s a myth that you will experience a wide variety of businesses [in consulting and finance],” he says, “that you’ll be exposed to different careers.”
“If you truly want to get a broad experience in, say, business or, say, the arts or, say, legal matters, wouldn’t it behoove you to become an apprentice to some master in that field, and then, by working more closely with her, get a more broad exposure?” he asks.
“But the reality of some of these immediate post-college training programs is that your job is to do the heavy lifting of data crunching or research work,” he continues. “You do not have a lot of freedom.”
The “gold star” culture that Van Vuuren references is part of a more common trope at Harvard and schools like it, one perhaps epitomized by David Brooks’ 2001 essay, “The Organization Kid,” which bemoaned the meek uncombative obedience of high-achieving millennials. Its generalizations aside, the argument does reflect a trend that Harvard administrators and faculty tend to refer to warily, if obliquely.
“I do somehow wish that some students would smell the roses a little more and schedule fewer appointments,” Lawrence H. Summers told The New York Times in 2004.
“Don’t compare, connect,” Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, repeats to students at his speeches year after year.
Michael E. Berlin ’15, an executive director of Veritas Financial Group who hopes to start his own company, thinks that this phenomenon makes sense for the typical Harvard student. “In middle school you do well so you can get into the honors program in high school,” he says. “In high school you do well to get into a good college; in college you do well to get a good job, one of these stable jobs.”
“And it’s totally not a bad thing at all,” Berlin concludes. He adds, laughing, “It’s probably what I’ll end up doing.”
For over 17 years, Lynn E. Barendsen, a project manager at the Graduate School of Education, has conducted research with young people and professionals in a variety of different fields for the Ed School’s GoodWork Project. Together with Howard E. Gardner ’65, Professor of Cognition and Education, she has also helped to conduct the “Reflecting On Your Life” sessions for Harvard freshmen.
Barendsen says that much of her research is relevant for students entering their first job or career. In interviews conducted with over 1,200 people, she tells me, one of the questions centered on responsibility, asking to whom or to what they felt responsible.
It turns out, she says, that the further on you are in your career, and life, the more responsibility you feel. “Young people would pretty much just talk about themselves and the circle outside of them,” she says, while those on the cusp of retirement were much more likely to talk about wanting to give something back.
It’s not selfishness, she says, but rather, “Young people don’t think that what they do has that great an impact.”
Despite what Carroll refers to as the “save the world” tendency of many Harvard students, Barendsen sees this same trend here as well. “We heard over and over again this intense pressure to make the most out of their degree,” she says.
Small-scale research conducted by another member of the project revealed what was deemed a “funnel effect.” “People coming into Harvard with an interest in many many different careers ended up being sort of sucked into this funnel,” says Lynn, “and working in mostly finance and things like that.”
Part of it was the pressures of recruiting season, she continues. “Other opportunities—if you’re going to wait and see about other opportunities—those often aren’t represented on campus until much later. Everyone else is interviewing, and to sit back and say, ‘Well, I don’t know if I want to do that,’ is incredibly stressful and anxiety-provoking.”
That’s not to say, Barendsen hastens to add, that “good work” (which the project defines as ‘excellent,’ ‘ethical,’ and ‘engaging’) isn’t possible in any career, including the finance and business worlds. But it’s difficult to attain, she thinks, without taking some time to consider how to achieve good work in whatever one decides to do.
“Often people get so busy—especially Harvard undergrads—that they don’t have the time to sit and think,”she says. “‘What does make me happy? What do I want to do? And how can I surround myself with mentors or models that will help me make these decisions?’”
The inexorable march of the recruiting process may allow students to defer that kind of reflection. Mount cautions against the myth that OCI is the “easy” way to find a job.
“It looks easy, it looks like you just put your application in and then you get these interviews,” she says, “but in fact those people have networked with alumni in those firms, they’ve been to their information sessions, they’ve shown a lot of interest, and they’ve done a huge amount of homework and prepping for those interviews.”
Lim agrees, “It’s not easy by any means.” But, she adds, “it’s a little clearer how to do it.”
“Harvard kids are always busy,” she continues. “How much are you willing to spend some time to go search for an option that you may or may not know is out there if you have time that you think is valuable to you that you can devote to your extracurriculars, or to recruiting for something that you know about already?”
“Harvard kids are very success-driven,” Lim says, “and whatever takes them to that success—if it’s clearer, it might be easier to take that path.”
Anxiety, Misdirected?
A little after 1 p.m. on an unseasonably warm day last week, it was lunch break for the interviewers at the OCI facility, and the red-upholstered chairs on the fifth floor of 1033 Mass. Ave. remained mostly empty. The first student to arrive took a seat near the front, cleared his throat, and adjusted his red-and-white striped tie. He looked out the window onto the foliage of a New England fall, the spires of Annenberg barely visible in the distance.
The room slowly began to fill up, most ignoring the wooden table littered with The New York Times, The Economist, and the Wall Street Journal open to Section C (Money and Investing). Some chatted among themselves; “I think I’ve seen you at a few of these,” a thin blond woman said to the student to her left, and the two struck up a conversation; others texted or shifted nervously in their chairs.
At 2 p.m. sharp a tall, young-looking redhead emerged from the offices. Everyone’s heads shot up. “Eleanor?” he asked. And the first interview began.
“People don’t talk about it,” says Andrew, the senior from Poland, of the interview stress associated with the recruiting process. “There’s a lot of pressure, but it doesn’t exist in public conversations and public discussions. It is there and everybody feels it, but nobody brings it up.”
This pressure, according to Van Vuuren, is misguided. “Students can literally do anything for the next five years and still be employable,” he says, “and they do the most risk-mitigating thing that’s the safest possible decision.”
“Honestly,” he says, “it’s irrational. The evidence is now fully on the side of taking risk. There’s an abundance of capital; you can find jobs all over the world. Students are doing the irrational thing by aggressively and violently mitigating risk right after college.”
Part of this tendency might stem from the simple fact that the vast majority of students haven’t yet spent much time in the workforce—or in anything other than a 17-year-long cocoon of school, with its clear standards, requirements, and results.
The metrics of success to which Harvard students are accustomed do not necessarily translate easily to the “real world,” particularly on the bottom rungs of a career ladder.
The simultaneous silence and ubiquity of recruiting may take the place, then, of sustained conversations around careers on campus—and with them, a more realistic understanding of just how important, or not, the first two years out of college might be.
Kathryn A. Cosgrove ’07 spent most of her college career examining how historical trends are reflected in comic books and graphic novels. An English concentrator with a creative writing focus, who also completed significant coursework in Visual and Environmental Studies, Cosgrove avoided recruiting throughout senior year. “Mostly because I was just scared,” she says. “I was an English major. ‘I can’t do banking; I can’t even do math.’”
After a summer internship with National Geographic convinced Cosgrove that the solitary life of a writer wasn’t for her, she cast a wide net senior year. Never having spent significant time abroad, she applied for a teaching fellowship in China after graduation. She spent a few years as a product manager for Abercrombie & Fitch, and ultimately returned to Harvard to run the Law School’s sustainability program.
Now in her final year at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, Cosgrove’s story results in a possibly unexpected denouement, as she only recently discovered what she believes to be her passion: private wealth management.
“It’s a combination of working with people and working with markets,” says Cosgrove. She thinks her creative background has helped here: “Being able to kind of be a teacher and an educator and a communicator around a person or an institution’s investments was probably a differentiating factor for me.”
Cosgrove says she could easily have been happy going into consulting or banking for two years right out of school. “I think it really does give you a broad base,”she says. “You’re working on such interesting problems and meeting such interesting people.”
But she has no regrets on the long, winding road she took to get to her current position. “It’s such an opportunity,” she says of the initial post-graduation years. “Anything you go and do, as long as it’s something that seems interesting and you feel like you’re going to learn a lot.”
The chances that this will be your last career, she says, are close to zero. So, “you might as well just go someplace where you see smart people who are working on things that interest you, and you think you’re going to be able to learn a lot.”
“I think for me,” says Cosgrove, thinking back on her twenties, “life is just so long. ”The tunnel vision that seems to result from the recruiting process—from the undergraduate years in general—is, Cosgrove intimates, less necessary than we seem to believe. Follow her advice, and seniors may end up at Goldman Sachs after all. Or not, as the case may be.

To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Highly Stressed Senior, and this is my 27th cover letter of the day. Since I have 16 more applications due before the looming midnight deadline, I am in dire need of a stiff drink, and have decided to play a little game.
1. Take a sip for every company you haven’t heard back from. Limit yourself to 20. If you applied to more, and haven’t heard back from any, you should probably be sober more often.
2. Have you had any interviews? Have a glass of champagne for each one, you champ you.
3. Count the number of business cards you’ve collected. Take a sip for each. Finish your drink if you’ve started a Pokemon trading card-esque game with them, “Trade you three associate consultants for one Managing Director!” “Ok, but only if they’re McKinsey!”
4. If a job asks you to apply on Crimson Careers AND on their website, ask yourself if you really want to go through the enormous effort to work at an obviously high-maintenance and diva-ish company that is clearly going to demand too much from you. When the answer is inevitably no, down two drinks, one for Crimson Careers and one for their website.
5. If you’ve had to skip class for an interview or networking event, shotgun a beer to make sure you’re keeping in touch with your college self.
6. If you don’t change out of your suit before making an appearance at brain break in your interview attire, better bring along a martini and a cigar to really ensure everyone knows you are a big deal.
7. Take a drink every time someone asks what you’re doing next year. If you don’t want to spend the next six months in the hospital with alcohol poisoning, take a gulp for each conversation that doesn’t involve your job plans.
8. Take a shot for every person you see at a networking event that you remember from section as definitely dumber than you. Feel better about your prospects of being hired. Then realize there are ten more people there thinking the same thing about you.
9. For every existential crisis you have, where you find yourself curled up on your bed, questioning your purpose and regretting every decision you’ve ever made, take a shot of your own tears and welcome yourself to the next decade of your life.
10. If you’re looking at non-profit jobs, wait until the bankers and consultants buy you a drink.
11. When you resent your pre-med friends for having a clear path ahead of them and a certain career at the end of it, take a drink for every year of residency they’ll have.
12. Any time anyone hears you share your anxiety about job searching and waves their hand dismissively while repeating “You’ll have a Harvard degree, you’ll be fine,” take down the bottle of Grey Goose you have on the shelf of your luxurious single in Eliot, reach for one of the glasses your father, class of ’76, gave to you, and enjoy the plethora of jobs that will keep dropping in your lap thanks to that Harvard degree.
13. If you forgot to change the name of the company before sending in your cover letter, finish your drink. Pour yourself another. Finish that one too.
14. If you get a job offer, congratulations! Start drinking. Don’t stop until May.
15. If you write an article promoting unhealthy drinking habits just in time for potential employers to Google you in your own job search, keep up your sober, academically and extracurricularly rigorous lifestyle, and take solace in the fact that if anyone hires you after this, at least you’ll know they have a good sense of humor.

Best part about Harvard: The people, obviously it’s the people! Just the diversity of the backgrounds and skills and talents. You can meet anyone and everyone here. I have to say, one of the misconceptions about Harvard at Yale is that everyone is so hard to talk to. But Harvard students are really great, and they know how to have fun.
Worst part about Harvard: I guess the whole lunch situation, going back to the houses for lunch. And Fly-By, Fly-By sucks. I hate Fly-By.
Describe yourself in three words: Oh gosh, college admissions interview? Um… dynamic, creative, curious.
In 15 minutes you are: Super busy or procrastinating.
In 15 years you are: In fifteen years, I’ll be… Oh my God, I’ll be 36. Maybe I’ll be making the transition from industry to public policy, I think. Hopefully I’m definitely switching up careers a little bit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While any recipe for ice cream will usually call for milk and sugar, Ash Chan, owner of the ice cream purveyor Churn2, says that one extra ingredient will make for the best frozen dessert: liquid nitrogen.
Churn2, an ice cream shop housed in a shipping container, is the newest addition to the Science Center Plaza.
Prior to opening Churn2, Chan said he had no previous experience in the ice cream business. During the first test batches of his ice cream recipe, Chan said he accidentally froze his knuckles to the mixer.
Since then, Chan said he has come far in recognizing the added benefits of his particular ice cream method. According to Chan, liquid nitrogen is simple and effective.
“Liquid nitrogen just works,” he said. “It keeps the ice cream fresh and allows a lot of creativity without a lot of constraint. Housing the store in a box, with the smoke from the liquid nitrogen is also a show.”
Patrons of Churn2 said they agree with Chan’s assessment of his ice cream. Jake W. C. Silberg ’15 said he found Churn2’s product to have slightly more texture than regular ice cream.
“Without the mix-ins, it’s smoother than other ice cream,” he said.
Chan also emphasized the uniqueness of his ice cream’s texture.
“There’s less aeration and less overall texture,” Chan said. “It’s like butter...There’s very little water content.”
David A. Weitz, one of the professors of the popular course Science of the Physical Universe 27, “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter,” elaborated on the science behind Churn2’s operation. The use of liquid nitrogen causes the ice cream to freeze faster and produces a unique texture, according to Weitz, which allows for a wider range of ingredients.
“Ice cream is a foam, and the bubbles of air are stabilized because fat globules go to the interface between the air and milk and stabilize the bubbles,” Weitz said. “Churning brings particulates to the interface, but that doesn’t happen with liquid nitrogen because it’s so fast and they don’t churn.”
Weitz said that he would expect the ice cream to be less creamy.
“It melts more slowly and retains its shape longer,” he said.
Liam Bradbury, who said he was a native of Australia on a visit to Harvard Yard, agreed. Bradbury said that the ice cream left no fatty layer of film on his mouth.
Whether it’s the chemistry or the novelty of Churn2’s ice cream, customers have been lining up at the shop. The flavors change daily, but Chun recommends his favorite: Caramel Apple.

Fielding questions about Harvard’s email privacy policy task force at an open forum Wednesday afternoon, David J. Barron ’89, who heads the group, detailed the complex challenges it faces to developing a comprehensive policy as the group begins to solicit input from across the University.
The nearly hour-long event, held in a Harvard Medical School lecture hall, represents one step in a broader effort by the task force to engage with numerous constituencies on both of Harvard’s campuses before it begins drafting its recommendations. It is the first of two public forums, the second of which will be held in the Science Center on Oct. 23.
The feedback session drew around 35 people, who asked questions about the task force’s scope and discussed potential legal and technical issues that a privacy policy might need to consider.
Barron, a Harvard Law School professor and former Crimson president, kicked off the event by listing more than a dozen questions that the task force hopes to answer, from the specificity and scope of the policy guiding administrators to how email searches should be documented. Barron said that the task force’s “animating” principles touch on three areas: candor, trust, and the free flow of information required by a unique University setting.
Many attendees’ questions centered around the breadth of the task force’s mission. Barron replied that it would not be possible for his group to consider every privacy-related question.
“There are many different types of privacy issues,” he said. “We are not a general privacy task force trying to resolve all of those issues. We are focused [on] electronic communication...that travel over systems and networks that the University administers.”
He also said that the task force hopes to generally preserve the user experiences that exist now.
“All of us were using these systems and networks for years and years quite successfully,” he said. “The idea is not to reinvent the wheel.”
University President Drew G. Faust commissioned the task force, with Barron at its head, in the wake of last spring’s email search scandal. That case, in which administrators secretly searched the emails of resident deans, prompted concern and confusion throughout the community over what rules govern Harvard-operated accounts.
Barron said that an investigation into those searches, completed earlier this year by Boston attorney Michael B. Keating, showed that current policy particularly lacks protocols related to the documentation of searches.
“The record keeping is not terrific,” Barron said. “But we have looked into [past searches] as best we could over a reasonable period of time.”
“I think we all have a high degree of confidence that it is a rare practice,” he added.
In addition to the two forums, the University opened an online discussion board this week that allows members of the Harvard community to leave written comments for the task force. As of Wednesday evening, the website had one comment.
Barron and several members of the committee have also met with representatives of the Undergraduate Council as well as Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students in recent weeks.
“We were serious about wanting to reach out to the community more broadly,” Barron told The Crimson after the event, adding that he thought Wednesday’s forum was “very helpful.”

CORRECTION: Oct. 13, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that David J. Barron ’89 and other members of the email privacy policy task force recently met with representatives of the Harvard Graduate Council. In fact, while task force members did meet with Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students, they did not meet with Graduate Council members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cancer patients who are married are more likely to survive the disease than non-married cancer patients, according to a new study by Harvard researchers.
The study—published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology—looked retrospectively at nearly 735,000 married, single, widowed, and divorced cancer patients from across the United States, analyzing diagnoses between 2004 and 2008.
Even after adjusting for age, sex, and median household income, unmarried patients were 17 percent more likely to have cancer that metastasized—or spread from its original site—than were married patients, and were 53 percent less likely to receive appropriate treatment.
“The real message here we think is that social support makes a difference for patients with cancer,” said Ayal A. Aizer, clinical fellow at the Harvard Radiation Oncology Program and first author of the paper.
Paul L. Nguyen ’98, the study’s senior author and radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, explained that the study was motivated by an interest in the tangible health benefits of support networks in general, rather than in marriage specifically.
“We wanted to find out what kind of impact social support has on cancer treatment and survival, and one of the best proxies we have for that is marriage,” said Nguyen.
“For so many of these cancer patients, support is just so important for getting them to the doctor physically, but also for emotional support, coping strategies, and preserving mental health,” said Aizer.
Both authors noted that there were certainly some support networks that the study did not account for, such as same-sex couples that would have been lumped in the “unmarried” category, suggesting that the health effects of having no social support network could be even more dramatic than suggested by the study.
“Our results may be underestimated for patients who don’t have support of any kind,” said Nguyen. “In some ways, these are the people we should be most worried about.”
In addition, the authors of the study emphasized the need for doctors to prioritize adequate social outlets as a form of patient care.
“We as physicians need to be asking our patients when they come into the clinic—especially after the diagnosis—what options they have in terms of support,” said Aizer. “Doctors do this already, but we could do this more often.”
“What I want this study to do is make people recognize the importance of social support,” said Nguyen. “If you have a friend out there with cancer, help them get through treatment.”

In keeping with the tradition of a Senior Common Room in each upperclassman House that connects Harvard’s faculty to residential life, faculty members will now affiliate with freshman entryways as well through the “Faculty Fellows Program,” an initiative created by the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Advising Programs Office.
The program matches professors with a freshman entryway and encourages at least two to three meetings between faculty members and students over the course of the semester. Activities may range from lunch in Annenberg to museum visits to discussions anchored around the faculty member’s field of study.
This fall, 11 entryways across all four freshman yards have been paired with 11 professors for the program’s pilot run. The first set of faculty fellows come from a variety of fields and include Andrew Berry, lecturer on organismic and evolutionary biology; Margo I. Seltzer, a computer science professor; and Benedict H. Gross, acting math department chair.
The program was conceived last year out of a desire by the FDO to increase interaction between students and professors during freshman year.
“In freshman surveys, students always tell us that they wish they had more opportunity to interact with faculty,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “Through this program, professors can become engaged in an easy, accessible, almost effortless way, while also enhancing the freshman experience.”
In collaboration with the APO, the FDO drafted a proposal for the program, which was initially called the “Harvard Yard Senior Common Room.” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris immediately approved the idea.
“Each house has a Senior Common Room, but we really wanted to get more interaction between freshmen and faculty,” said Ivy Yard Resident Dean of Freshmen Michael C. Ranen, who spearheaded the program at the FDO. “We identified faculty who we know were generally excited to develop these relationships with students.”
The pilot program consists of a diverse pool of entryways—both big and small, with old and new proctors—so that the FDO can best assess what model will be most successful. If all goes well, the program will be expanded to all freshman entryways as early as next year, Ranen said.
Faculty members began meeting with their respective entryways last week. Music department chair Alexander Rehding, who met students from Holworthy Middle over lunch at Annenberg last Friday, said that he thought the new program was a “great idea.”
“There’s something wonderful about freshmen. The level of excitement is different,” Rehding said. “It’s a magical time for them and I think that’s why it’s so remarkable to interact with them.”
Rehding, who already knew Holworthy Middle proctor Brandon P. Geller ’08, said that planning the meal took little effort and that he was glad to spend the time with students.
“Next time, we’re looking into organizing a study break with him or even a jam session because a lot of my students are very musically inclined,” Geller said.
Cesar E. Maeda ’17, who attended the meal with Rehding, said the meal helped “ease [his] perceptions of Harvard professors as being unreachable and classy.”
“I think this is a great initiative,” Maeda added. “It helps expose freshmen to professors, when we would have otherwise never had the chance.”

In describing her discipline, history professor Tamar Herzog related the study of the past to a vast forest crossed by many trails. She said those who study history must constantly choose which trails to take, or forge their own paths.
Herzog introduced this image to the audience of Wednesday’s “History is Everything/Everything is History” panel, an event designed to promote the discipline and entice potential concentrators. Besides Herzog, panelists included history professors Robert C. Darnton ‘60, Andrew D. Gordon, and Annette Gordon-Reed.
Throughout the evening, speakers sought to emphasize the complex, multifaceted, and ever-present nature of history.
“The DNA in your body, the way you dress, the kind of family you grew up in—all of these things carry traces of the past,” said department chair David R. Armitage, who introduced the panelists. “The past is very much alive.”
Professors spoke both about their recent projects and what the discipline of history means to them. Darnton, who recently wrote a book about censorship in Bourbon France, British India, and Communist East Germany, described some of his more exciting moments as a historian.
He recalled his experience studying at The Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall. There, he met with two official censors for the East German Soviet government, who showed him the document in which they catalogued each piece of literature to be published in that year.
“When you tell people you’re in history they give you this pained expression because that was the course they hated in high school,” said Darnton in an interview with The Crimson before the event. “But history can be exciting, intellectually rigorous, and fun.”
Gordon, whose recent publications include “Fabricating Consumers: The Sewing Machine in Modern Japan,” also emphasized that investigating the history of even the most seemingly mundane objects or events can reveal amazing insights.
“If you had asked a hundred, maybe even a thousand historians of Japan what book ought to be written, I don’t think one of them would’ve said, ‘Oh, we need a book on the sewing machine,’” joked Gordon. “But the sewing machine tells us all about the constitution of the family and gender roles.”
For Gordon-Reed, who specializes in the study of American slavery and has published works on Jefferson and the Monticello plantation, the most important aspect of history is our constantly evolving understanding of it.
The event was one of several that the department plans to host in October and November, leading up to the deadline for sophomores to choose their concentrations.
“I declare this panel historic, and I declare this panel history,” Armitage said to wrap up the evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday evening, President of the European Central Bank and former IOP Fellow Mario Draghi delivered the 2013 Malcolm Wiener Lecture in International Political Economy at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, in which he addressed the origins and current challenges facing the European Central Bank, an institution which, among other goals, attempts to maintain the value of the euro in the European Union.
The lecture came the evening after Germany rejected a proposal from the EU that would have temporarily allowed the European Commission to aid struggling banks in Europe.
Dean of Harvard Kennedy School David T. Ellwood ’75 moderated the lecture.
“I know of no finer, more dedicated, more honest, and more able public servant than Mario Draghi,” said Lawrence H. “Larry” Summers, former University president and current professor. “His reputation for strength, character, and competence transcended individual country loyalties.”
Draghi emphasized that the European Central Bank is a relatively new organization—it was established in 1998—and said that he sees the bank and Europe as being “engaged in a far-reaching process of reform.”
Rather than an “ever closer union,” Draghi viewed the European endeavor as “better encapsulated by wording borrowed from the Constitution of the United States, ‘establishment of a more perfect union.’”
Recognizing the “anxiety” created by what seems to be “an inexorable movement towards a future super-state,” Draghi said that policymakers in Europe are just following the 1999 decision to create a genuine single market supported by a single currency.
Draghi also emphasized the need to prioritize effectiveness over “abstract principles” in deciding how to move forward.
Draghi explained the concept of the “banking union,” an issue of heated debate amongst European policymakers.
“A genuine banking union can give citizens more trust in their money than can different national approaches.” Draghi said, arguing that it is necessary “to remove the differences in the banking systems that can create fragmentation along national lines.”
Rick Lopez, a political consultant who attended the lecture, was unimpressed with Draghi’s argument.
“Eurozone is a disaster. The austerity policy that these countries have been forced to adopt has created strains, for example, on their healthcare system,” he said. “It is brutal austerity.”
However, Charles-Henri Weymuller, a graduate student in economics from France, expressed support for Draghi’s vision.
“It is a win-win arrangement,” he said. “From today’s perspective, you might be a little skeptical, but Draghi’s message is to be a bit far-looking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the second of three scheduled open forums designed to solicit student feedback on the ongoing search for a new Dean of the College, undergraduates on Wednesday night urged Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and members of his search committee to choose a new College Dean who will be attentive to the idiosyncrasies of the Harvard social scene.
The 75-minute meeting, which drew a crowd of about 25 students to the Lowell House Junior Common Room, took the form of a wide-ranging discussion that covered issues ranging from the duties of the Dean of the College to the social effects of final clubs to the experience of students living in the Quad.
The forum is part of a larger effort to involve students in the search process for a permanent replacement for Evelynn M. Hammonds, who stepped down on July 1 after five years as College Dean. Since being formed over the summer, Smith’s advisory search committee, which consists of 21 professors and no students, has sought to engage the undergraduate community through open discussions and a meeting with the Undergraduate Council.
Wednesday’s conversation got off to a quick start. After Smith offered a textbook definition of the role of the Dean of Harvard College, many students said they would prefer that the next dean make it a priority to interact with students in a variety of forums.
“Part of the dean’s job should be ‘boots on the ground,’” said attendee Christopher A. Smiles ‘15.
“The quality that would be most important to me would be sort of “spontaneous interaction” [between the dean and undergraduates],” offered another attendee, James P. Biblarz ‘14. Biblarz said that he would like to see the next College Dean at House social events such as Stein Club.
A number of students also suggested that the University look within its own ranks for the next dean.
“I would [prefer] somebody who has had extensive interaction with Harvard College students,” said Sarah E. June ‘14. “[Somebody who] in some sense had an experience with Harvard students, not necessarily another school’s students, because it is a different experience.”
As the forum progressed, the dialogue moved from a concrete discussion of the search process to a more flowing conversation of social life at Harvard and the House system, and how a new dean might address concerns in both areas.
“I’ve loved my experience here so much, but my biggest disappointment is how dominant I find the final clubs to be of Harvard’s social life,” Biblarz said. “I hope that the Dean of the College can think of creative ways to produce social options for students that are as compelling.”
The statement got the room buzzing. N. Gregory Mankiw, Economics Department chair and a search committee member, asked if men and women have different experiences with final clubs, prompting a wave of laughter and a collective “yes” from the audience. The exchange continued when another student asked Smith if the University saw final clubs as a problem.
“Yeah,” Smith replied. “Not a problem exclusively, because there is a large, long history there that I think should be recognized and celebrated, but the activity that goes on there, absolutely it’s a problem.”
When asked how the administration was planning to remedy the situation, Smith again replied matter-of-factly.
“If there was an easy [solution] we would have done it,” he said. “We struggle with it all the time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s President’s Challenge for entrepreneurship includes two new categories—efficient governing and economic development and sustainable employment—according to an announcement made by University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber on Thursday.
Established in spring 2012, the President’s Challenge invites students and postdoctoral fellows at Harvard to develop innovative solutions to current issues and provides expert advice and networking opportunities for student entrepreneurs. It will recognize its third set of recipients this fall in project categories that also include education innovation, energy and the environment, and affordable health.
As in previous years, the winner and up to three runners-up will share a grand prize of $100,000 to develop their fledgling enterprises.
“The President’s Challenge [is intended] to encourage the formation of teams, to explore novel ideas, to get lots of advice, and ultimately, to be shepherded through the process of implementation,” said Harvard Business School professor William A. Sahlman, who will co-chair this year’s judging panel.
According to computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who will speak at a kick-off event on Oct. 16, the President’s Challenge brings students from different academic backgrounds together to think about not just commercial success but also success in solving the world’s problems.
“Students in computer science have a history of coming up with wonderful ideas and launching them into world-changing businesses,” said Lewis, who taught both Bill Gates and Mark E. Zuckerberg when they were at Harvard. “What the President’s Challenge has done is to divert some of [students’] energy and attention to think about social utility as well as business success.”
Past winners of the President’s Challenge, Vaxess Technologies and Team Nucleik, are now testing their ideas in the marketplace, backed by nearly $4 million and nearly $2 million in venture capital, respectively.
According to Vaxess co-founder Patrick Ho, the President’s Challenge helped his team develop their idea and provided them with a network of support.
“We met a lot of people, both from within the University and outside the University,” Ho recalled. “One of the mentors assigned to us was Jeffrey Walker, a philanthropist who ended up being an angel investor in our Series A financing.”
Additional opportunities that fund the transformation of student ideas into practice include the Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge and the Deans’ Health and Life Sciences Challenge, both established in 2013 to support initiatives in the arts and sciences.
According to Gordon Jones, managing director of the Harvard Innovation Lab, 127 student groups submitted their projects to the President’s Challenge two years ago. Last year, the number of student teams who participated in the President’s Challenge or the Deans’ Challenges reached 250 and consisted of more than 600 Harvard students and 150 members of the nearby community.
“I continue to be amazed by the meaningful innovations that students come up with across the University,” Jones said.

As debate over the federal government shutdown continues in Washington, funding for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has dried up and approximately 100 federal workers at the Center have been sent home.
A collaboration between the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the Center houses more than 300 scientists and receives both University and federal funding.
With fewer scientists, researchers, and technicians at the Center due to furlough, some research projects have been placed in jeopardy, while many other collaborative endeavors have been set back by the shutdown’s effects on other institutions that receive federal funding.
Professor of astrophysics James M. Moran estimated that approximately 100 workers at the Center were sent home on Oct. 1. Many of the people who have been furloughed are technicians and staff members who help the Center to operate smoothly.
“Many of the people who would fix things have been furloughed,” said Moran.
The Smithsonian appropriations for the Center total just under $26 million. Other federal agencies, including NASA, have provided an additional $95 to 100 million annually, according to professor of astronomy Charles R. Alcock.
These contracts, staggered in receipt, will slowly run out in the next month or two, causing an even greater burden on the Center if the government shutdown continues.
“Research has been hampered,” said Moran.
In particular, the shutdown has jeopardized the research of Mark J. Reid, an employee at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and associate of the Harvard College Observatory currently on furlough.
Reid’s research uses a vast network of radio telescopes across North America to map the Milky Way galaxy. His research, which demands a strict schedule of data collection, was disrupted by the closing of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.
If Reid cannot resume research in collaboration with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory before November, a year’s worth of research will be lost. “We will have to throw away the data,” said Reid.
Given the high costs of operating these technologies, Reid estimated that such a loss could cost as much as $500,000.
Moran, who also uses the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, said he expects his research to be delayed as well.
Beyond the loss of funding and wasted research, Alcock noted that the shutdown has delayed new grants and prevented the disbursement of those recently awarded. “No new awards are being made,” said Alcock. “There’s no one at the National Science Foundation to make them.”
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory moved to Cambridge in 1955. The partnership with Harvard was formalized in 1973, when the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics was founded.

Computer science professor Hanspeter Pfister was named director of the Institute for Applied Computational Sciences at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences last Monday. Pfister is taking the place of physics professor Efthimios Kaxiras, who has led the Institute since its founding in 2010.
“It’s hard to imagine someone better suited for the job. [Pfister is] fantastic, and programs like the IACS are in immense demand,” said computer science professor Ryan P. Adams. “There is an immense educational need for this.”
Since its founding, the IACS has offered a one-year Computational Science and Engineering master’s program as well as a secondary field in CSE for Ph.D. students. This year, for the first time, the interdisciplinary education and research program is also accepting applications for a two-year Master of Engineering degree.
“Most universities have this sort of master’s degree program,”  said Pfister. “These students bring a new dimension to Harvard. Allowing them to be on campus will create a new generation of alumni.”
Pfister, who in addition to his role at SEAS is also an affiliate faculty member of the Harvard Center for Brain Science, received a master’s in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and a Ph.D in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Prior to his arrival at Harvard, Pfister spent over a decade working for the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. His lab at SEAS works on a wide variety of topics, including biomedical visualization, image and video analysis, 3D fabrication, and data science.
“He’s a great person to be running the IACS--very collegial, very friendly,” said Molecular and Cellular Biology and computer science assistant professor David D. Cox ‘00. ”I’m very happy Hanspeter is doing this.”
In addition to its degree programs, the IACS provides students with the opportunity to partake in a biweekly seminar series with leading figures from academia and industry. Every year, the Institute hosts a computer science convention known as “ComputeFest” featuring panelists from across various industries.
“[The IACS] is a valuable initiative at Harvard, given how important computer science is becoming in every field,” Cox said.
Future plans for the Institute include increasing the variety of possible fields of study and expanding its physical presence. The Institute currently occupies a space in the Northwest Labs, but it is preparing to expand its presence by moving to Allston in the coming years.
“Space is the ultimate frontier,” Pfister said.

Members of the Allston community remain divided on the promise of a community benefits package attached to Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston, which the Boston Redevelopment Authority will accept or reject on Oct. 17.
As part of its ten-year, nine-project IMP, the University has proposed a package of community benefits worth $17 million to fund projects that include community programs and improvements to local infrastructure, as well as $10 million for the creation of a new teaching and learning center. This center would host AllstonX, a program to improve digital literacy for all age groups and which mimics HarvardX, Harvard’s branch of edX.
Members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force expressed disappointment that the benefits package did not include large development projects, such as the construction of affordable housing and the renovation of The Gardner Pilot Academy, a local school.
Task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said the money allocated to community programming will be spent to maintain programs that Harvard already offers in Allston.
“I’d be delighted if large capital investment projects were included in the benefits package,” Whelan said. “Just maintaining the status quo and adding things here and there is really disappointing.”
He added that the benefits the University has proposed are “great things, but are not the things that would really transform the community.”
Last week, the task force submitted a comment letter to the Boston Redevelopment Authority offering suggestions for the University’s IMP. The letter included a fourteen-page community benefits proposal that focused on four areas: education, housing, employment and workforce development, and open space and transportation. Whelan estimated the cost of the entire proposal to be between $50 million and $100 million.
Another task force member, Harry E. Mattison, said that the University’s community benefits package did not reflect the priorities of the community.
“When you think about what Harvard is offering, it’s a lot of ideas and vision but not a whole lot of real, tangible things that…have lasting benefits and impact,” he said.
In an emailed statement, Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that the IMP does “reflect the interests we've heard from the Allston-Brighton community.”
In fact, not all Allston residents shared the task force’s criticisms of Harvard’s community benefits package.
“I believe the Harvard IMP should be accepted as written,” Reynold M. McKinney said. McKinney, who has lived in Allston for 44 years, said that some of the community benefits the task force proposed were not practical.
“[The members of the task force] want Harvard to take care of things that are outside its scope…as an educational institution,” he said.
McKinney also suggested that there is a lack of communication between the residents of Allston and the members of the task force.
“Everybody I know thinks of Harvard’s expansion into Allston as a godsend to this town,” he said.

The Bears were laid into by Brown this week (not a typo) as women’s rugby co-captain Xanni Brown scored five tries and added five conversions for a total of thirty seven points, seeing the Crimson through to a momentous 57-7 win. However, while Xanni was The Crimson’s athlete of the week, The Back Page is recognizing other high-achieving Crimson athletes.
Corinne Baine, Women’s Volleyball
Women’s volleyball slugged it out against Brown on Saturday, losing in a five-set thriller. Freshman Corinne Bain put up a monster triple-double with 15 kills, 11 digs and a whopping 33 assists in the loss. There are exciting times ahead for this young talent.
Paul Stanton, Football
Crimson football had a long Saturday, playing through to triple OT against the Holy Cross Crusaders in a 41-35 win. As the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. In this case it was sophomore running back Paul Stanton who put the team on his back. His game-winning touchdown in the third overtime period brought his total for the day to 103 yards on 21 carries for two touchdowns – one, however, slightly more important than the other.

In the new film, “Linsanity,” released on October 4th, Jeremy Lin ’10, Harvard-alumnus-turned-NBA-phenomenon, connects with his fans and the basketball community on a newer level.
Director Evan Leong brings out the most of Lin’s past and present in this film, everything from his ever-so-famous rise to stardom in 2012 that gave the movie its namesake to the more sobering issue of racial stereotyping in basketball, something Lin has had to deal with for most of his life.
Those who expect this movie to be a shallow attempt at reviving the Linsanity phenomenon will be pleasantly surprised. Leong had been planning this film out since Lin’s years at Harvard and interviews Lin’s family, friends, teammates, and coaches to paint a full picture of the Houston Rockets point guard.
The first American-born Asian player to crack an NBA starting lineup, Lin’s journey begins with old footage of AAU tape from his early years. After tackling the origins of Linsanity in its nascent years in Palo Alto, the movie moves from Cambridge to New York and Houston in tracking the 2012 ESPN Breakout Athlete of the Year through the highlights of his career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the game tied at 35 in triple overtime on Saturday, sophomore running back Paul Stanton scampered 17 yards for a game-winning touchdown against Holy Cross. The run was fourteen years in the making.
“I picked up football when I was five,” Stanton said. “My dad coached me, and when I started playing, I immediately knew that I wanted to play running back. I’ve basically been playing running back for my whole life now.”
Both passion and talent drove him to a successful career at Jesuit High School in New Orleans, La., where he lettered three times in football, played starting running back for two years, captained the team as a senior, and led the team to its first 12-0 season since 1946.
When the college recruiting season came around, however, it was purely by chance that Stanton landed on Harvard’s radar.
“I went to all the other Ivy League football camps,” Stanton said. “And someone at Brown told me, ‘There is also a camp at Harvard, you should check it out.’ So I did, performed pretty well there, and that’s when they started recruiting me.”
Head coach Tim Murphy still recalls the memorable impression Stanton made on him and his coaching staff as a high school athlete.
“He was just one of those players that, when [I] watched the films, stood out as fast and athletic but kind of small,” Murphy recalled. “But the more [I] watched the films, the more I thought, ‘Wow, this guy can really play.’ The other coaches who watched him agreed as well.”
Stanton’s talent earned him valuable playing time in several games for the Crimson while he learned from his teammates, particularly starting running back Treavor Scales ’13.
“I tried to learn as much as possible from Treavor,” Stanton recalled. “And when I got the opportunity to compete, I simply tried to do my best out on the field.”
Saturday at Fitton Field, Stanton delivered the defining performance of his Harvard career so far, putting an end to what is tied as the longest game in Harvard football’s 140-year history and propelling the Crimson to a perfect 3-0 (1-0 Ivy) record. Harvard has only had one other triple-overtime game, which came against Yale in 2005. The game-winning play in the 2005 edition of The Game was also a rush, made by running back Clifton Dawson.
“When I made the first cut, I pretty much saw daylight,” Stanton recalled. “So I knew I was going to be able to score. When I actually scored, it was the greatest feeling ever, the fact that we came out on top of such a game, one of the most brutal games I have played through. It was just a great feeling that I was able to do that for my team.”
For his performance against Holy Cross, Stanton was awarded the John Turco Memorial Trophy, presented annually to the most outstanding player in Holy Cross’ homecoming game. Overall, Stanton rushed 21 carries for 103 yards and scored two touchdowns, while also amassing 55 receiving yards.
“I think ‘emerge’ is the word,” Murphy said about Stanton, who has seen increased playing time since sophomore Zach Boden went down with injury. “[Stanton] is clearly a tremendous player. He’s fast, he’s athletic, he’s instinctive, but he’s tougher, more physical, and more versatile than we give him credit for.… What was truly amazing last weekend was how many yards he got after contact. He broke several tackles, pushed the pile, and was very instinctive about where the best place to run the football was.”
Stanton’s talent and work ethic has also left a positive mark on his teammates.
“[Stanton] is very dedicated to the craft [of football],” captain Josh Boyd said. “He works extremely hard during the lifts, he always focuses during practice, and he is respected by all of his teammates by way of the work he puts in and the tenacity he runs the football with.”
“With Treavor now gone, he has really stepped up as an athlete and as a leader,” he added. “This is only his second year of playing, but he has shown flashes of brilliance that make us think he will become one of the best [running] backs in the league.”
Heading into the faceoff against Cornell this weekend and the remainder of the 2013 season, Murphy believes that Stanton will play a crucial role for the Crimson.
“He is the kind of player that can give us that diverse offense that we really believe in,” Murphy said. “He is legitimate. There is no question that he is one of our best offensive options.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a devastating overtime defeat last week, the Harvard field hockey team (3-5, 1-2 Ivy) bounced back with a dominant road performance against UMass-Lowell. The Crimson jumped out to an early lead and never lost it as the team shut out the River Hawks on their home field, 4-0.
“Tonight was a great game,” sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson said. “We came out with all of our energy. We really went out full force and came through with a pretty good game.”
Harvard solidly commanded the offense throughout the entire match, hitting the back of the net four times on 10 attempted shots, compared to the River Hawks’ five scoring attempts.
The most notable offensive performance can be attributed to Marissa Balleza, the rookie forward who has already made a huge impact on the squad. Balleza tallied two goals in the match, making her scoring total this season three goals and an assist.
“Marissa played amazing in the circle,” Jacobson said. “She capitalized, and she was always there.”
The win was a group effort for the Crimson, as three different players contributed to the scoring. Adding to the offensive effort were junior midfielder Caitlin Rea and freshman back Sophie van Weede, who added a goal each.
“The mindset going into this game was about each of us doing our job,” junior forward Noel Painter said. “We focused on the few things each of us needed to do to get the win.”
Not to be outdone on the other side of the field, Harvard managed to clinch its second shutout of the season. Senior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield came through with one save, while sophomore goalie Madison Jung recorded another two saves in net. This combined effort kept the opposing team scoreless the entire match.
The Crimson’s defense has been consistently strong this season, with Hatfield recording a total of 45 saves to date, anchoring Harvard’s defense.
“Jenn Hatfield is playing great,” Jacobson said. “She’s having incredible saves, and we’ve got other girls adding blocks in the back.”
In their inaugural Division I season, the River Hawks entered the match with a record of 1-11. The team’s effort was spearheaded by Melissa Effertz and Kelly Freitas, who each contributed an attempted shot. UMass-Lowell goalie Melanie Hopkins notched three saves in the cage.
“UMass-Lowell has definitely been stepping it up,” Jacobson said. “But we came out with a little more energy, and we were able to capitalize on a lot of opportunities.”
The Crimson commanded the game from start to finish. Harvard has been using its experiences in the season thus far to strengthen its weak points and progress as a team. This win marked the end of a three-game losing skid for the Crimson, including a close loss to Brown.
“We played really hard in the Brown game, and to come out with a loss was really disappointing,” Jacobson said. “Coming into this game, we just knew that we had to come back. I think everyone pulled together and did really well.”
“We work hard every practice,” Painter said. “But the overtime loss really enforced some things we needed to work on in practice, and it paid off.”
The win is a huge confidence boost for Harvard, but the squad still recognizes that it has a long road ahead.
“We know that we have a lot to learn from,” Jacobson said. “[We have] a lot to get better at, but today was just a great boost for us.”
With this key victory notched, the Crimson squad is getting ready for its next match against Fairfield at Jordan Field on Sunday.
“We’re focusing on one game at a time,” Painter said. “We’re going to continue to work on our possession and scoring opportunities, and if we do that, we’re going to have a lot more wins.”
Harvard has yet to win a home game this season but will look to change that against a powerful Fairfield team that has won six straight matches.
“We would love to win every game,” said Jacobson. “But if we come out with a couple wins and a couple losses and progress as a team, that’s what we really want to do.”

You don’t think you can run a marathon? Then how about a half marathon? There is a saying that goes “If you can do the math, then you can run Boston's Half Marathon on Sunday.” It’s not a well known saying, I made it up. But here are a few steps you can take so that you can run the race, even if you haven’t done any training whatsoever.
1. Carbo-Load
It’s easy; all you have to do is eat lots of carbs. Needless to say this is the best part of running a half marathon. Especially if you count beer, like I do. Despite only deciding to run last week, I have been carbo-loading since September.
2. Train
Since you are already so behind with training, it’s probably good to just skip all the phases that you missed and jump right into the last phase of training; tapering, where you run less and less each day. I’m so far along with my training that I have gotten to negative distances. Half Marathon here I come!
3. Brag
The only way to guarantee that won’t back out last minute is to tell everyone that you are running. The more obnoxious you get, the more committed you’ll be. I personally recommend announcing your run via Flyby, but hiring a blimp for an hour also works.
 
The Admissions Blog explores first-generation Harvard students' experiences applying to and attending college. The interviews below have been edited for concision.
Jesse G. Sanchez is a Harvard College junior. He grew up in City Heights San Diego, Calif., where his mother, a Mexican immigrant, raised him in a single-parent household. Sanchez is helping to found the Harvard College First Gen Student Union, a student initiative that seeks to cultivate a community and peer-mentoring system for first generation students and will be the first officially recognized organization for first generation students on Harvard’s campus. He was a panellist at Crossroads: The First Generation College Student Experience on campus on Sept. 26.
 
Did being a first generation college student affect the application process for you? How so?
 
Without having someone in the home to ask about the application, to get advice about the application, to give pointers, to support me during the process, there was a bit of distance between me and the application, me and this college idea. But it also provided motivation to apply and submit the best application I could. I’m from a single mother household. Even though my mother wasn’t able to provide the advice on the application, she was able to keep my spirits high by providing the encouragement with her wonderful smile and amazing cooking.
 
 Did being a first generation student affect your transition to college?
I would say absolutely. When I had a midterm or a paper or a final or something else stressing me out about college, I would call my mother, she would impart her wonderful, beautiful, smart wisdom on the topic in general, but that inability to say “When I was in that situation I did this” sort of limited the ways that I thought I was supported. Coming into this brand new culture and not necessarily having this kind of social capital really limited my interactions with others. I didn’t do it intentionally, but when I didn’t know how to tie a tie, for example, or know the difference between different kinds of suit jackets, I couldn’t relate to many people who were here who had those specific experiences in the very beginning. Feeling like I didn’t belong here was an aspect of my experience, but then, on the other hand, coming here and being a first generation college student gave me some crazy sort of motivation to make the most out of the opportunities and, also to make the most out of the relationships here and to learn from others. It provided me with this incredible, incredible desire to just get to know people and learn from their experiences.
 
 What advice would you give other first generation students who are applying to college?
 
Number one, set your goals as high as you possibly can. There’s this saying that I love so much: reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on the clouds. Make sure you set the bar high for yourself. No one else is going to set this bar high for you. You have to do it yourself, and I’m going to tell you that you can do it. Two, look out for scholarships. Apply to any scholarships and opportunities available in your city, in your state, and in the U.S. as a whole. Look at the big-name scholarships, like Gates-Millennium, but also at local scholarships, which give you a better chance of getting the scholarship because they have a smaller applicant pool. Number three, have this conversation about your dreams, about your ambitions, about what this college dream means to you. Reflect on what this means to you, and share this with whoever is in your life: your parents, your guardian, etc. Make sure that you remember that all of your successes are the successes of those who care for you. 
Daniel M. Lobo is a Harvard College senior. He grew up in East Boston, Mass., as the son of Cape Verdean immigrants. Lobo is is helping lead efforts to gain official university recognition for the Harvard College First Gen Students Union. 
 Did being a first generation college student affect the application process for you? How so?
 
I was pretty independent during my college application process, and that came with its own set of pros and cons. I was pretty proud of myself by the end of it for having figured out how to apply to college on my own. Since I knew my parents weren’t in a position to pay the $75 application fee for all of the selective schools I was applying to, I figured out that if I just wrote a letter explaining my circumstances I could get a fee waiver. I did that for all my schools, which is something I realized my peers in high school didn’t know you could do. I think I was pretty resourceful, but I could have done a lot more research about the types of schools that would have been a good fit for me. I essentially applied to top tier schools—Ivies and a few other tier one schools—and then a safety school. I realize in retrospect that I completely ignored small liberal arts schools, and I feel like I would have done really well at an Amherst or a Williams. That was a downside to doing it on my own—I wasn’t as well informed as I could have been.
 
Did being a first generation student affect your transition to college?
 
In the beginning it definitely made it very difficult. Aside from the fact that I didn’t feel as academically prepared, and I wasn’t as academically prepared, for me—and this is particularly funny because I’m from so close to campus, but it’s just an entirely different world—I wasn’t used to being around such a high concentration of wealth. When I would have conversations with people and they would casually drop that they weren’t on financial aid, would make me think “wow, there are really wealthy people here.” It was really hard to be able to communicate with them when I first got here because I just didn’t know what we would talk about. They would talk about vacations that they’d taken, and I’ve never gone on a vacation outside of the States, I could never afford to do that. Not being able to communicate with a lot of my peers felt very isolating. I felt like I didn’t really have any social enclave to which I could participate in.
 
It was also difficult for me to realize that academic conversations are always taking place here. Even when you’re not in class, you still have to be turned-on academically, and people like to talk about interesting things, and that was really exhausting for me. I wasn’t used to being that academic all the time, I was used to being academic in a setting and then turning it off. That was very difficult, I felt like I wasn’t smart enough to carry on a conversation with people, which made me avoid things like study breaks or things that would necessitate further interaction with people outside of class, which I was very much intimidated by.
What advice would you give other first generation students who are applying to college?
 
I would advise that, as a first gen, it’s really important to realize going into the college process that these may be two competing worlds—the world that come from before you enter college, and the world that you’ll be in once you enter college. I definitely think I’ve changed a lot since my time at Harvard, which was my only goal. I came here wanting to walk out of Harvard a different person than when I walked in. The fact that I feel that happening already is amazing, but in acquiring this new language, this new form of social capital, and this new way of thinking, it’s almost like I’m losing the ability to do so with the people from my previous community. My advice would be to really think about ways that you can bring those two worlds as close together throughout your college experience, and keep those who you really love who aren’t part of your college experience as close to it as possible, which can be really hard. It might be a little too late for me, but I’m still figuring out ways to bring them together, but it’s really difficult, and it can cause a lot of turmoil for a first gen, so I think it’s important to think about coming in. 
Cody R. Dean is a Harvard College Senior. He grew up in Crab Orchard, W.V. Dean was a panelist at Crossroads: The First Generation College Student Experience on campus on Sept. 26.
 
Did being a first generation college student affect the application process for you? How so?
 
It affected me in terms of a lack of information. I didn’t really know anything about applying to college—what the process was like, what I should be thinking about, what the programs were like, what it meant to be a liberal arts school versus something more science oriented—beyond what was on college websites. It was all a big sort of put myself out there and see where it went experience. I applied to 32 schools, which was way more than any of my friends had applied to. Even beyond my own lack of family knowledge and lack of role models there, the guidance counselors were not very familiar with out of state applications processes. Having to write recommendations and fill out forms that they weren’t used to was all new to them, too.
 
Did being a first generation student affect your transition to college?
 
Absolutely. I felt more uneasy coming here than I did going through the application process and waiting and then deciding. For all of that you have limited data points. You can visit if you can afford to visit. Harvard flew me here, so I got to see it. I knew what I knew online. I met my alumni interviewer, who was the recently retired president of Concord College, so I had his perspective. But, no one had gone to Harvard from my school for 30 or 40 years, so there were no recent alumni around. Once I go here, though, I immediately felt like I didn’t fit in. I filled out a transfer application to another school and very seriously considered leaving, not because I didn’t feel supported or that I thought that there weren’t enough resources here for me or that it was the wrong fit per say; it was socially that I didn’t really immediately find a family. It took me a while as well in high school to find that, but realistically, I couldn’t chart out a path to me being comfortable here and that unknown was really unsettling. There are many other first gen students here, and the longer I was here, the more I fell in love with this place and found the people from similar backgrounds. That started with the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative having dinners and meeting like-minded people. You don’t always stay friends with them, and I honestly don’t even go to the dinners anymore, but it gave me familiar faces. As I found more people from similar backgrounds, I became a little more comfortable.
 
 What advice would you give other first generation students who are applying to college?
 
Number one, don’t sell yourself short. That’s very cliché, but I never thought that I would get in here—numbers wise, personality wise, interest wise, extracurricular wise. I didn’t think that anything about me exuded Harvard. I was a poor kid from West Virginia with an accent. No one in my family had ever been to college. Who was I to think that I was going to apply this place, let alone get in and then come here and succeed? But, if it’s something you want to do, don’t let the construction you have of yourself and the limit you have in your mind limit what you want to do, because you’re really the only person who’s limiting it. Two, if you do come to someplace like this, be prepared for a challenge, but also be confident in your abilities. You wouldn’t be here, you wouldn’t be thinking about applying to these places, if you didn’t have some sort of confidence that would help you overcome any of that.

There comes a time in every college applicant’s life when they realize their dream school. Well, maybe it doesn’t happen to everyone, but it sure happened to me.
Even before I visited Brown, I was obsessed. I loved their name brand Ivy recognition coupled with a laid-back atmosphere. I saw myself studying anthropology in knitted sweaters, the leaves falling, and intellectually engaged students everywhere. (This could only happen at Brown.)
I was determined to love campus before I set foot on it. My father and I drove there one warm Saturday at the end of the summer before senior year. Our tour guide was the same middle-aged man who’d given our information session. We trekked up and down the brick-paved sidewalks: campus sat atop a hill, overlooking downtown Providence from a lofty height. In reality, it was easy walking distance from the center of the city, though as one student representative put it, “We’re basically in the suburbs.” Should this have been a warning sign? Were Brown students less adventurous than I’d thought? Never mind that! I saw the school only through the rose-tinted glasses I’d purchased months before.
The Rhode Island School of Design sat at the bottom of Brown’s campus. “You can cross-register for classes easily,” our guide told us. I peered through ceiling-high glass windows into an art gallery. I liked painting.  At no other school could I paint like I could at Brown. The college grew ever more perfect in my eyes.
By the time we drove home that afternoon, I was beside myself. The tour hadn’t been anything special, but I loved Brown so much already that our visit had been almost a formality. I’d made my decision weeks ago: I’d apply early decision.
It wasn’t long before I knew I’d made the right decision: Emma Watson had just started her freshman year there! Though Brown was already my first choice, this elevated the school even more in my eyes. Our paths could cross in a variety of ways. “Do you have a pen?” she might ask, flustered, as she searched her bag in lecture. “Sure!” I’d say. “What’s your name?” Or maybe I shouldn’t feign ignorance. Surely she expected everyone to know who she was, even if she simultaneously loathed it. But what if she came over to study and I was caught unawares, without time to take down my “Half-Blood Prince” poster? These were very real concerns, but I was lucky to have them. I was going to Brown and I had to be prepared.
But wishes do not a college acceptance make. I’d have to write a personal statement that was quirky, sensitive, cultured, and intelligent enough for Brown. I knew I’d fit in great—I had four pairs of Converse and a plethora of ethnic jewelry, for God’s sake. Were these suitable criteria to determine my first-choice college? Only time would tell!
Now, all I had to do was write.
