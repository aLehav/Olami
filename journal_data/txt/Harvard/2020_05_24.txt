After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Love can hurt. And, as anyone practicing social distancing has surely realized by now, so can solitude. Combine the two and you get a doubly painful puzzle: the irony of finding isolation in something meant to be shared.
Leave it to Perfume Genius, the stage name of Seattle-based singer-songwriter Mike Hadreas, to artfully deconstruct these contradictions. His latest studio album, “Set My Heart on Fire Immediately,” explores the intersection of love and loneliness with fitting sonic unpredictability.
“Whole Life,” the album’s wistful opener, begins with a jarring admission: “Half of my whole life is gone.” As Hadreas watches time “drift and wash away,” he approaches the inevitability of loss with acceptance, not melancholy. “It was just a dream I had,” he continues, repeating the phrase as if to prove it to himself. But his trembling voice, though anchored by an inner resonance, makes him seem less than convinced. After all, he still harbors the memory of a lover’s departure, which he compares to a “clip on my wing.” But Hadreas is willing to let forgiveness replace his pain. “Oh, let it soften / I forgive everything,” he sings over a choir of expansive synths.
On the next track and lead single, “Describe,” Hadreas reminisces about a love as remote as an “echo in the canyon,” imploring someone to bring back the feelings he’s forgotten. For a meditation on the absence of emotion, the song features unexpectedly lush instrumentation: Forceful, stately guitar chords and synths underpin Hadreas’ plaintive appeals. He asks a different question on each repetition of the chorus, his desperation escalating against an increasingly dissonant backdrop. His final plea is the most direct and haunting: “Can you just find him for me?” To demonstrate the urgency of the question, the music fades out to a quiet hum that continues for the rest of the track, punctuated only occasionally by faraway electronic warbles.
The album’s title evokes a sense of exaggerated, almost comic urgency. But on “Leave,” the dark and surreal fifth track, Hadreas’ plea to “Set my heart on fire / Immediately” becomes suddenly serious as his voice quivers with somber conviction.
Co-written by Hadreas and his partner Alan Wyffels, “On the Floor” is an even more forthright confession of frenzied yearning. Right from the start, the track’s fast-paced, jaunty beat places it firmly outside the realm of the saccharine, heightening the tension and turbulence of Hadreas’ anguish: “I pace, I run my mouth / I pray and wait / I cross out his name on the page,” he lists, the constant pitch of each syllable forming part of a feverish ostinato. Hadreas envisions a love so obsessive and all-consuming that he loses control of his own heart: “How long ‘til this heart isn’t mine?”
Hadreas’ music often examines the prejudices faced by the BGLTQ+ community by incorporating narratives from direct personal experiences. But on “Just a Touch,” he turns to history instead. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Hadreas described the love song as a “wartime story” between two men trying to hide their relationship. “A lot of queer relationships were like that — they had to exist in secret, they had to be these brief, frantic, passionate explosions, and then afterward you would only have a memory to sustain it,” he said.
“One More Try” delves into similar themes of concealment and confusion, tinged with regretful longing. “Why’d we hide?” Hadreas asks in the second verse. “My life for one more try / Your hand in mine / I’d run straight to the light.”
The final track, “Borrowed Light,” returns to the nautical imagery of the first as Hadreas comes to terms with life’s uncertainty. “I thought the sea would make some pattern known / And swim us safely home,” begins the last verse. “But there’s no secret / Just an undertow,” Hadreas admits. After his voice fades out one last time, the album ends in a choral cadence of synths.
Nearly 10 years have passed since the release of Perfume Genius’ studio debut, “Learning.” His first and last albums feature remarkably similar cover art: hazy monochrome portraits. In the image from a decade ago, the album’s title obscures his face. But now, he stands tall and stares straight at the camera. Perfume Genius’ music blazes with compassion and defiance in equal measure, and listening to his latest album will, without question, set your heart on fire. Immediately.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brian’s decision to return home to Chester, Ohio — after living in New York City for six years and contracting AIDS in the middle of the crisis that gripped the 1980s — is at once an understandable and perplexing one. Why return to a town full of people who serve as daily reminders that he does not belong? And yet: it makes perfect sense. It’s a return to the family that loved him before he left, loved him while he was gone, and hopefully can learn to love him again after finding out what happened to him. Carter Sickels’ “The Prettiest Star” is Brian’s story, intermixed with the voices of his sister, Jess, and his mother, Sharon, and the result deftly portrays the heartbreaking ways in which public fear and ignorance can hurt just as deeply as AIDS itself.
The cast of characters seem familiar upon meeting them, even without knowing how, exactly, things will unfold. (Of course, technically, we know how the story will end.) Sharon welcomes her son back with nearly open arms, does his laundry, and feeds him, all while trying to avoid touching him. Jess doesn’t find out about Brian’s secret until watching some tapes featuring him and his boyfriend Shawn, whose life AIDS also claimed. Travis, Brian’s father, keeps his distance physically and emotionally, refusing to defend his son to the rest of Chester and whose inability to grapple with the situation burdens his wife. Then there’s Mamaw, who inwardly and outwardly claims her grandson in a show of love and refusal to abandon him. And then — given the novel’s setting in the middle of the AIDS crisis, a time when people knew how the disease was transmitted but had not yet begun to unlearn their bigotry, anger, and fear — there’s the predictable reactions of the extended family and townspeople, who shun Brian and his family.
The structure of the novel and the characters’ personas are the only clichéd aspects of “The Prettiest Star,” and while these two elements are the foundation of the novel itself, nothing feels out of place or forced. Sickels resists the urge to include a blowout scene, complete with tears, slammed doors, or any of the high-energy drama that one could expect to see. Rather, the novel’s beauty lies in all the tensions that simmer beneath the surface; in the unspoken anguish both Travis and Brian undergo, albeit for very different reasons; and in small details like Mamaw’s Avon fragrance and the meals Sharon prepares.
Thankfully, Sickels does not shy away from the medical side of AIDS, though the novel primarily chronicles Brian and the devastating psychological toll it takes on him. Through Brian, Sickels reminds us that “the disease can come for you in so many ways. Cancer, blindness, dementia, pneumonia, wasting. It’s never pretty, never easy.” There are many hospital visits, and many moments in which Brian is at the mercy of those who choose to care for him. Unfortunately, it’s the 1980s, and those who stay by his side do so partly out of obligation — but partly, too, out of their eventual choice to defy the prejudice of Chester, for which Josh, the pastor, is the figurehead. Sharon, Mamaw, and Andrew — the only other openly gay figure — stick by him. It is no coincidence, of course, that Andrew tells Sharon that “‘This is the only thing we have to do. Take care of him.’”
Through it all, Brian remains optimistic, reminding himself that he’s heard worse: “Parents who refuse to touch their son, who make him eat in a separate room, who do not visit him on his deathbed, who bleach whatever he touches, who do not claim his body from the morgue. Could be worse.” Sickels delivers such matter-of-fact statements over and over throughout the novel, to the point that they come to form the novel, such sentences only underlining many years of psychological and physical suffering the BGLTQ community endured in the 1980s, and beyond.
Change is slow, while fear is easy to lapse into. No character undergoes deep, profound, soul-searching changes for the sake of readers’ literary satisfaction. Yet change does come, in fits and starts and small gestures upon which we rely on as signals of empathy and love. In that way, Sickels’ novel is an evocative, if at times painful and frustrating, rendering of the beginning of the AIDS pandemic — a force that seems so large, and perhaps so distant for the younger contemporary reader, that it is easy to gloss over the human bodies who bore it and were felled by it.

“Money is its own country,” according to author Emily St. John Mandel, and in her latest novel — ”The Glass Hotel” — Mandel explores exactly what people are willing to do in order to become a citizen of this country of the wealthy. The book is loosely based on Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, but “The Glass Hotel” is vastly different from the economic thriller it could have been. Instead of focusing on the logistics of the scheme itself, the book intricately weaves together the lives of many characters who come into contact with Jonathan Alkaitis and his investment venture, both before and after his arrest. Although the novel lacks the excitement that might be expected of such a book, Mandel has done again what she does best: wrapping up the stories of a large cast of characters into one cohesive package.
Mandel is particularly interested in her characters’ “counterlives” — essentially alternate universes in which they made different decisions. Alkaitis imagines himself in a swanky hotel in a country that doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the US, instead of in a maximum-security prison cell. Others picture what their life would have consisted of if their entire life savings hadn’t been stolen. The idea extends so far as to leave an Easter egg for readers familiar with her last book, “Station Eleven,” as the main character Vincent imagines “an alternate world where the Georgia flu blossomed into an unstoppable pandemic and civilization collapsed.”
But despite the focus on lives not lived, Mandel also pays particular attention to what leads people to make certain choices. One of Alkaitis’s employees asks another, “How did he know we’d do it? Would anyone do something like this, given enough money, or is there something special about us?” Are those who work for a Ponzi scheme particularly bad, or do they just succumb to greed like any human would? Another employee explains under cross-examination, “It’s possible to both know and not know something… that knowing and not knowing, being honorable and not being honorable, knowing you’re not a good person but trying to be a good person regardless around the margins of the bad.”
It all comes down to money. Vincent agrees to pose as Alkaitis’s wife, although Vincent doesn’t love him. She realizes, “What kept her in the kingdom was the previously unimaginable condition of not having to think about money, because that’s what money gives you: the freedom to stop thinking about money.” “The Glass Hotel” doesn’t romanticize wealth — after all, most of the wealthy characters also struggle with deep-seated unhappiness or stress — but does understand its appeal, even as it actively makes its characters miserable.
The downfall of this novel is that it isn’t particularly exciting or suspenseful. It’s clear early on that at some point, Alkaitis will get caught and go to jail, and investors will lose their retirement funds or their life savings. Luckily, the novel is fairly short and Mandel has a trick up her sleeve. As in “Station Eleven,” this book comes full circle by explaining strange occurrences from the early chapters and giving characters symbolic ends to their story arc in a way that feels particularly poetic. Almost everything falls into place — though Mandel does leave the slightest bit of mystery — which propels the story for the final 50 pages or so despite the story’s overall lack of excitement.
“The Glass Hotel” is a quietly rewarding book. Despite its subject matter, it is as unlike a financial thriller as can be. Instead, it offers a look at the lives left unlived and the siren song of money. Come for the Ponzi scheme, stay for the satisfying conclusion.

People live on in memories. For Antonia, the narrator of “Afterlife,” her husband Sam maintains a strong presence in her life a year after his passing. Though he is no longer physically present, he is as real as any other character in the book: Antonia finds her choices and thoughts shaped by her memories of him and his beliefs. In fact, it is the thoughts and ideas from the past that loom the largest in this novel. Antonia is a retired English professor who holds cherished lines from the “old masters” in her memory, weaving a safety net from the wise, trusted scraps of literature that guides her through difficult times. “Afterlife” is a graceful, reflective depiction of grief, duty, and love that provides comfort and needed advice for trying times — that one should do what’s right, but it’s okay to do only as much as is possible.
This highly anticipated novel is the first in many years from celebrated writer Julia Alvarez, the Dominican-American bestselling author of “How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents” and “In the Time of Butterflies.” Alvarez has received critical acclaim for her graceful and careful narration of Latinx stories, and “Afterlife” is no exception. Antonia’s family are immigrants from the Dominican Republic, and the novel is at its liveliest when the “sisterhood,” which consists of Antonia and her three sisters, is present on its pages. Though their interactions consist mostly of funny sibling squabbles, the fierce love they have for each other shines through, and the tight-knit nature of their family keeps Antonia grounded.
The sisterhood is both Antonia’s bedrock and another source of turmoil, contributing to the novel’s exploration of grief. On top of her husband’s death, her oldest sister, who the rest of the sisterhood is almost certain struggles with some kind of mental illness, disappears. Then, the pregnant girlfriend of the undocumented workers across the street seeks out Antonia’s help with no where else to go. Overwhelmed, Antonia seeks boundaries — “the narrow path,” lined with only the problems she can handle while separating those of the rest of the world. Yet she never strays into selfishness, since her own caring nature as well as the proddings from beyond of her kind husband and strong parents keep her accountable as she helps those in need. Broader topics such as climate change get only a glancing nod, yet readers see Antonia’s strong sense of empathy in her descriptions of being the “tiresome” dinner party guest preaching on the “death of the planet” and undocumented workers.
Though the novel often deals with difficult subjects, it manages to be comfortingly reflective and inspiring, expressed through gorgeous descriptions of sunrises imbued with “spring watercolor light,” and sharply witty writing. Time is often blurred, not just through flashbacks, but also with the reflections of a future Antonia, adding a haunting sadness to tragedy with preemptive lines that hint at the events to come. Past, present, and future intermingle, contributing to the air of reflection and introspection.
Grief and tragedy line the novel, yet Antonia’s struggles with these issues resolve themselves into a poignant, subtle depiction. Alvarez walks a narrow path, avoiding severity while ensuring that the reader never loses sight of the stakes of her story and never once doubts that the issues in question matter. Though the title is “Afterlife,” this is a story well grounded in reality. Antonia finds that people’s touch on the world lives on, and that “the only way not to let the people she loves die forever is to embody what she loved about them.” And more than the people in her life, it is the words from literature — Dickinson, Rilke, Auden, Rumi — with which she “wordsmiths” her world, using their lines to “plug the holes” in her life. The stitching of familiar, classic poetry gives this novel a transcendent quality. The collective consciousness of humanity, in the form of literature and memories, lives on in her, informing her actions, and showing us that even after life, a person still makes a difference in this world.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview with The Crimson Friday that Harvard administrators are considering “all possible scenarios” as they plan for the fall semester but that plans are “likely to vary by school.”
Bacow noted that the University’s decision on whether instruction would take place in person will depend on the individual schools and their “different requirements and different capabilities.” Harvard Medical School announced last week that first year medical, dental, and graduate students will begin classes online in the fall semester.
“The campus will be open,” Bacow said. “The question is how many students will be on campus and what will be the form of instruction.”
Bacow said Harvard College is discussing options to de-densify housing if the semester is held in person for undergraduates.
“We’re looking at a variety of alternatives,” he said. “Some of which include bringing some people back and not others. Some of which would include utilizing housing stock that's traditionally not been utilized for undergraduates.”
He added that the school is “still awaiting some guidance” from the state to determine “how dense” housing can be for students living together.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in April that the University will be open this fall regardless of whether classes are conducted online or in-person.
If the semester is to be online for College students, Bacow said most courses will be specifically designed to be taught online.
“This spring, faculty members had essentially 10 days to pivot from their normal pedagogy to online teaching, and as a result, they were pressed to master new technology and to adapt their classes very very quickly,” he said. “If we are online in the fall, it will be with courses — at least a majority of courses — that have been designed to be taught online.”
As the University weighs scenarios for the fall semester, Bacow said he is also in conversation with other University and Ivy League presidents. However, he said the schools in the Ivy League face different considerations based on their location.
“The urban campuses — Penn, Columbia, ourselves — many of our employees rely upon public transit to get to and from campus,” he added. “That's not true at Cornell, for example, or Dartmouth. The availability of public transit and the safety of public transit is a factor that we have to consider in determining what we're going to do in the fall.”
Bacow said the University has not yet determined whether public transit will be safe and whether employees will feel comfortable traveling to work using public transportation such as the T.
Harvard will announce whether classes will be held in-person or online no later than July but will inform students of its decision as soon as it is reached, according to Bacow.
“Once we’ve reached a decision, we’ll announce it,” he said. “We are exploring every possible alternative, and some of those alternatives are a function of events that are completely out of our control like the status of the virus at a particular moment in time, the availability of effective, quick, and affordable testing, and a variety of other conditions.”

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, alongside attorneys general from 14 other states and the District of Columbia, filed a brief in a federal appeals court Thursday in support of Harvard University’s race-conscious admissions process.
The brief comes as part of an ongoing lawsuit pending against the University over allegations by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions that Harvard College’s admissions process discriminates against Asian American applicants.
The First Circuit Court of Appeals is currently hearing the case, following an October 2019 district court ruling finding that the admissions process does not intentionally discriminate.
Healy and her colleagues wrote that the appeals court should rule in Harvard’s favor, arguing that race-conscious admissions policies are critical to providing students with higher education that includes “diversity of all kinds amongst their peers—including racial diversity.” They wrote that exposure to diversity prepares students to be “future leaders as diverse as the communities they will serve.”
The brief also pointed to affirmative action in higher education as a potential remedy for a lack of diversity in primary and secondary schools as a result of residential segregation. It noted that states that have banned public colleges and universities from considering race in admissions have been less successful at forming diverse student bodies.
A group of major American corporations — including Apple, Microsoft, General Electric, Twitter, Verizon, and Cisco among others — also filed a brief backing Harvard’s admissions process. Lawyers for these companies wrote that businesses also benefit from diversity among college graduates, and that diversity within business allows for better competition, talent recruiting, and performance.
Many of Harvard’s peer institutions — including MIT, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and the other seven members of the Ivy League — also voiced their support for Harvard’s admissions policies.
Several other groups filed amicus briefs in support of Harvard, including a coalition of 26 Harvard student and alumni organizations, professors and scholars from several hundred different institutions and organizations, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American Council on Education and other higher education groups, the Anti-Defamation League, and two basketball coaches’ associations.
SFFA has the opportunity to file another brief in the case by June 4. The court will then decide whether to grant oral argument, which would occur roughly several months after that brief is filed. Following a ruling in the case, the losing party might then choose to appeal to the Supreme Court.

The Class of 2020 has witnessed multiple historic national shifts during four years at Harvard, including everything from the 2016 presidential election to the #MeToo movement. But the current pandemic has guaranteed that graduating seniors will enter a completely different world from the one that existed when they arrived in Cambridge.
After evacuating Harvard during their senior spring, members of the Class of 2020 will graduate into an economic recession and a world dramatically upended by the novel coronavirus. The Covid-19 outbreak has forced the majority of survey respondents — 52 percent — to alter their postgraduate plans. Though most of the class approves of Harvard’s response to the outbreak, far more are pessimistic about President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis and believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction. On campus, they largely support race-conscious affirmative action and the movements calling on Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels and private prisons.
Each year, The Crimson conducts a survey of Harvard’s graduating class of seniors, collecting data about where the class is headed next, how they spent their time at Harvard, and what they think of the College and the nation. The Crimson distributed this year’s edition to 1,664 seniors via email and garnered 884 responses, representing a response rate of 53 percent. The survey remained open from April 30 to May 22 and was anonymous. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible non-response bias.
Though the Class of 2020 may be divided over campus issues and Harvard’s handling of various controversies, they remain firm in their college decision. More than 90 percent of seniors said they would choose Harvard again.
Compare this year’s results to the Class of 2019.
