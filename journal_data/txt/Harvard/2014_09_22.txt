After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The divestiture issue creates an unusual opportunity for Harvard—one that invites Harvard to take the long view and recommend a better and safer approach to energy and climate. There’s a focused message Harvard should send as it steps up to the challenge.
Harvard has been in business for almost 400 years, not only as a keeper of tradition but also as a source of foresight. Harvard should therefore invite everyone to look four centuries ahead and to imagine ourselves in a world reshaped by the unchecked consumption of fossil fuels.
Vast amounts of damage appear certain. Ice sheet melting will have become unstoppable. Sea levels could well be on their way to a 23 foot rise from full melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and another 16 foot rise from full melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. As one may learn by studying USGS topographical maps, only one small high point of Harvard Yard—near Lamont Library—sits more than 40 feet above sea level. MIT’s campus, the Smithsonian, and coastal communities everywhere would are equally endangered. And that’s just for starters.
The world is being drawn toward this future, even today, by consumption habits that express themselves on massive scales. Worldwide consumption of coal, oil, and natural gas throws off 35 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.  I’ve asked NOAA scientists how such tonnages are to be translated into parts per million. Their emails tell me that one ppm of CO2 weighs 7.77 billion tons.
In broad terms, then, here’s what happens.  Of each year’s 35 billion tons, a portion is absorbed by the Earth’s woodlands.  The ocean absorbs some as well.  Almost half remains in the atmosphere, raising CO2 by two ppm per year.
There is only one atmosphere. Lakes make neighbors of all who live along their shores. The atmosphere, then, makes neighbors of all who breathe its air. We are called—Harvard along with everyone else—to protect our common atmosphere, to prevent it from becoming a source of great harm.
Some aspects of tomorrow’s world can be predicted because they follow rules of proportionality: Technology ownership statistics enable experts to predict fossil fuel consumption rates. Consumption estimates allow scientists to predict CO2 emission totals. CO2 emission estimates make it possible to predict tomorrow’s stocks of CO2, both in the atmosphere and in the ocean. And those estimates permit rough predictions for average temperatures and ocean acidity.
But as we reach the critical part of this causal chain, rules of proportionality disappear and tipping point uncertainties take over. Climate isn’t nearly as predictable as temperature; effects on marine creatures aren’t nearly as predictable as future acidity. As stocks of CO2 expand, doubling and possibly even tripling, what sort of damage becomes the new normal?
Heat waves will take more lives, but where and how many? Massive storms will create larger floods, but how large and how often? As glaciers shrink and disappear, depleted rivers will harm farming regions that have long relied on their waters, but how badly? Ice sheets will lose their cohesiveness, but how fast and how dangerously? Hurricanes of unprecedented fury will rise from the world’s warming seas, but how often? If food supplies dwindle, how many regions will be overtaken by war? Will climate change be experienced as an intensely damaging nuisance or as a terrifying game-changer? Its darker possibilities are beyond the reach of anyone’s forecasting horizon.
Luckily damage on a truly massive scale is not foreordained. A wiser and safer course is within our means. But how do we chart it?
We begin by setting aside habits of fuzzy thinking. For quite some time, scientists and activists have characterized global warming as an annual flow problem, i.e., as an emissions problem, one that nations can contain by reducing total emissions of carbon dioxide. This approach shapes the core of the Kyoto Protocol.
Today’s situation is more accurately characterized as a problem of rising stocks. The greater the stock of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the greater the harmful consequences—further warming, accelerating climate change, greater acidification, and so on. If we are to create a safer future, we should do so by capping the total stock of atmospheric CO2.
In other words, we move forward by replacing yesterday’s fuzzy emphasis on CO2 emissions with tomorrow’s clear-eyed focus CO2 stocks. We do this best by replacing the Kyoto approach with the Montreal approach. Just as the Montreal Protocol protects the ozone layer by requiring a swap-out of dangerous technologies for safe technologies, a safer future for the climate will require yesterday’s portfolio of fossil fuel technologies to be withdrawn from service and replaced with tomorrow’s modernized portfolio of climate-safe technologies.
As a premier academic institution with an enormous amount of influence on academic and social thought, Harvard could help set the planet on the right path. If Harvard does the right thing and divests, it will have a few minutes on the world stage and a chance to share some vital messages. “Let’s take the long view.” “The Earth has one atmosphere; we are in this together.” “We cannot forecast the unknowable; we dare not learn how much damage an angry climate will cause.” “We achieve a safer future by committing ourselves to a full swap-out of energy technologies.” And most importantly, “A better future is ours to earn.”

As the virality of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge ushered in a new era of philanthropy this summer, critics of the millennial generation certainly held their breath. For once, they thought, social media is taking on its do-good, action-oriented, politicized transformation! Well, that is, as “do-good” as posting a video pouring an ice bucket and donating a week’s worth of babysitting can get.
In the end, however, the philanthropic financial success of the Ice Bucket Challenge cannot be denied. Though many complained that it was simply another form of faux-philanthropic narcissism (“Half the people don’t even know what ASL—I mean ALS—is!”), one cannot deny the impact of the Challenge as grassroots donations exceeded over $100 million fundraised in only 30 days, compared to the $2.8 million the ALS Foundation received at the same time last year. This translates to better research, patient support, and administration for the Foundation.
Yet, while the Ice Bucket Challenge was gaining momentum, there were a plethora of other events that occurred that desperately could have had a share of people’s charity as well: namely, the families deeply affected by the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
To this day, the money raised for Officer Darren Wilson (over $350,00), the police officer who killed Brown, far exceeds the amount of money raised for the Mike Brown Memorial Fund (over $200,000). To this day, Darren Wilson is on paid vacation while answers of justice on behalf of Brown’s family still go unanswered.
While it may seem illogical to compare the timing and philanthropy of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge to the tragic killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson, I cannot help but think that the dichotomy of race in philanthropic giving is a new phenomenon. On the ALS website, I found an interesting fact: Nearly 93 percent of the patients afflicted with ALS are of Caucasian descent.
In addition to its clever use of social media, I cannot help but think that the virality of the challenge has a lot to do with its patient racial demographic.
I am not denouncing efforts for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. I personally believe it is an ingenious use of social media methods in order to raise awareness and philanthropy about neglected cause, a medical issue largely ignored because of the scarcity of its numbers, affecting a little over 5,600 lives each year. Each life deserves to be as full as possible.
Yet, on this same principle of each life being equally deserving as the other, philanthropy is telling of how the act of giving—especially through the lens of medical research—is very much so a political and racial issue.
The medical funding of sickle cell disease versus that of cystic fibrosis is one of the most telling differences of this political and racial landscape.
Sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis are both autosomal, recessive genetic disorders. Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic blood disorder in the U.S. affecting 70,000-100,000 Americans. Cystic fibrosis affects 30,000 Americans.
But sickle cell disease disproportionately affects the black and Hispanic populations: affecting 1 in 600 black and 1 in 36,000 Hispanic infants. On the other hand, cystic fibrosis is most common among whites, with 1 in 2,500 North American Caucasians born with the disease.
In 2003, revenue for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America was less than $500,000, whereas cystic fibrosis research funding was $152 million for the CF Foundation, a 300-fold difference.
Even according to recent reports from March 2014, the National Institute of Health funds cystic fibrosis ($80 million) more than sickle cell disease ($70 million).
While we claim to be living in a “do-good” society and share photos of our selflessness on social media, we must ask ourselves: Are we “doing good” good enough?
It is true that many do not know of the demographics of the ALS patient population. It is true that many still don’t know what ALS even is.
Yet while these ALS Ice Bucket Challenge promotion videos undoubtedly enabled us to see the humanity of ALS patients, would parallel videos of SCD patients of color have moved us to share and donate in the same way?
Can I say that the same virality—social media and donation dollars—would have happened if it were, say, the Sickle Cell Disease Ice Bucket Challenge?
I wish I could say yes. And I hope one day I will.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Congress voted to arm so-called moderate Syrian rebels to aid their fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. America has spent over two decades involved in the perennial crisis in the Middle East and if anything has exacerbated the problems greatly. We are disappointed with Congress’s decision, and fear that this course of action will result in further problems.
There seems to be no question that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria poses a severe threat to the rights and lives of those living within its sphere of influence. The group has conducted a violent persecution of other religious groups (including Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Yazidis and Mandaeans). Women are afforded little freedom and live daily in fear of rape and sexual violence. Clearly, something must be done.
However, arming and training Syrian moderate rebels should not be the first step. There is little indication of how these so-called moderate rebels will be identified, and what steps, if any, the U.S. government will take to ensure that these rebel groups continue to operate in ways that align with U.S. interests.
The U.S. does not exactly have good precedent on its side. A salient example is “Operation Cyclone,” the CIA initiative to arm Islamist guerrilla fighters against the Soviet Union. Those fighters included Osama bin Laden. Elsewhere, concerned about Iranian involvement in the area, the U.S. government also assisted the Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein.
More recent examples show that supporting militants in the fight against ISIS has already produced mistakes. Conflict Armament Research, a private organization that tracks weapon supplies internationally, identified that ISIS has acquired U.S.-made weapons intended for other Syrian rebels. CAR has also found evidence that ISIS holds weapons (such as M16 and M4 rifles), which are the same models that the U.S. government provided to Shiite Iraqi forces. There is no guarantee that further shipments of weapons to the so-called moderates will not make their way to ISIS, thus arming the terrorist organization further.
The current plan of airstrikes has only been in place for about a month. The airstrikes also have support from other countries, such as France. Should these allied forces coalesce to execute a joint attack, the results could be deadly to ISIS. It is at least worth waiting until that time before the U.S. takes the risky step of arming rebel militias.
Of course, the airstrikes should be used conservatively. Continuing humanitarian aid for civilians is also critical. In the end, the ISIS situation in the Middle East is a complicated one. Alliances have been redrawn, and at the moment the U.S. stands allied with Iran and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The president and Congress cannot solve Syria’s complex challenge by their own fiat. The U.S. should learn from past mistakes and, for now, limit scope while still working to ensure the safety of women and religious minorities in the area.

Beneath a ribbon sporting Leverett House colors, leaders and beneficiaries of the House Renewal process took turns Saturday afternoon lauding the recently completed renovation of McKinlock Hall and thanking donors who supported the multimillion dollar project.
Jazz music mixed with the chatter of more than 100 attendees gathered in the newly dedicated Stapleton Courtyard, some of whom eagerly pointed to their former bedroom windows. The dedication came three weeks after students moved back into the building and during one of the University’s largest alumni reunion weekends.
Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 opened the ceremony by noting that the renovations of the dining hall and the surrounding spaces have “had a transformative effect on the most important task in the House, which is eating, and all of the intellectual and social activities that go with it.”
Georgi added that the new dining hall has become “too attractive to be resisted by students from other Houses” and estimated that dining hall staff had served more than 700 meals on certain nights. Georgi mentioned that he has decided to impose restrictions on the number of non-Leverett students that can eat in the House as a result.
Georgi introduced Leverett House Committee Secretary Casey M. Fleeter ’15, who spoke of her experience as a resident of McKinlock Hall. Despite drawbacks of renewal like the crowded dining hall and the loss of en suite bathrooms in McKinlock, Fleeter praised the constant connections with her fellow students in McKinlock’s long hallways and said the common rooms on each floor have become “very coveted territory.”
In her remarks, University President Drew G. Faust invoked the vision of her predecessor President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, whose initial plan for the Houses brought students of different class years together in the hope of nurturing lifelong relationships in “communities based on shared experiences rather than accidents of birth and similarities of fortune.”
“From its beginning, the House plan embodied the very best of philanthropy, marrying vision and generosity to shape an institution’s future,” Faust said. “Now, here we are, nearly a century later, taking great care to preserve the character and the essential features of Harvard’s Houses as we reimagine them for a new century—all with the support of individuals who believe that bringing people together creates opportunities that simply would not exist otherwise.”
One of the House Renewal co-chairs, Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 emphasized the importance of the project in maintaining the College’s competitive position among peer institutions, particularly after Yale completed 13 years of residential college renovations in 2011. He reflected on his past as a resident of neighboring Quincy House and looked to the future of the renewal process, stating that “it’s mandated, absolutely mandated, that we continue our efforts with every House until the campus is entirely updated.
McKinlock’s renovation followed that of Quincy’s Stone Hall, completed in 2013 at a price tag of $45 million. Like that test project, Leverett’s modernization came in on time and under budget, O’Donnell noted. Though he did not give the project’s exact cost, it is expected to carry a higher final price tag than that of Stone Hall.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith concluded the afternoon’s speeches by thanking the House Renewal co-chairs and more than 20 donors who now lend their names to renovated spaces in McKinlock.
After Georgi and his wife Ann cut the ribbon to officially reopen McKinlock Hall, they ceremonially passed “the House Renewal shovel” and a pair of hard hats to Dunster House Masters Ann and Roger B. Porter, who have inherited the next stage of the project with the reconstruction of Dunster underway just a few blocks from McKinlock. Dunster is the first full House to undergo renewal.
The ceremony was followed by optional guided tours of the House, an alumni gathering in the Masters’ Residence, and a student reception in the dining hall.

Dozens of Harvard students and many more affiliates took their environmental advocacy beyond the blockades of Massachusetts Hall this weekend, joining hundreds of thousands of activists on the packed streets of a warm Manhattan.
The event, dubbed the "People’s Climate March," came just two days before a United Nations climate summit is set to convene in New York and attracted about 400,000 people, according to march organizers. The march stretched nearly two miles of New York City roads toward the UN headquarters.
Talia K. Rothstein ’17, a media co-coordinator for Divest Harvard who helped organize transportation for about a dozen group members to New York City, said that the People’s Climate March provided a clear opportunity to witness the recent groundswell in climate activism.
“The People's March was a moment for the movement more than anything else,” Rothstein said. “It really provided an amazing snapshot of how far the environmentalist movement has come,” adding that it wasn’t just “white tree-huggers” who were on the street campaigning, but a diverse range of activists.
Rothstein said that the march was so jammed that it took nearly two hours for her to start moving once the front of the procession advanced.
“There were marching bands. There were drums. People were chanting. There were puppets and floats and beautiful banners,” Rothstein said. “One thing that was really powerful, was near the beginning, while we were still standing still, there were a few minutes of silence… in honor of communities that are already feeling the effects of climate change.”
Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, a leader of Divest Harvard, said that divestment student groups from across the nation met with each other on Saturday ahead of the march to swap stories about their campaigns.
“We talked about what it’s like when there’s a low point in our group morale or how we react when our administration gives us a 'no' or when we first faced arrest,” Maxmin said. “These are challenges that we are all facing individually, but it is through the support of our peers that we are able to overcome them.”
Harvard students from other organizations were also in attendance Sunday, including students from the Law and Extension schools, as well as alumni.
Rebecca V. Park '16 said she was motivated to organize a delegation of students from Harvard Hillel because of the “really powerful history of Jews in environmental movements.”
Hosted by Columbia Hillel, the Harvard Hillel delegation attended both student and professor-led discussions about environmental activism throughout the weekend leading up to the march.
Sarah S. Fellman ’18, who attended the march as part of the Hillel delegation, said she felt empowered by the experience. “It’s really great to hear about people’s back stories and why climate change matters to them and why they think it matters towards the world—it really is a global project.”

Harvard Law School’s Human Rights Program celebrated on Friday afternoon the increased awareness surrounding issues of human rights since its founding three decades ago and detailed the next steps for activists in the field.
The afternoon program included two panels—“Human Rights Advocacy Across Generations” and “The Next Stage in United Nations Treaty Bodies”—and a keynote address by former Yale Law School Dean Harold Hongju Koh ’75.
“It is wonderful to look back at the graduates we’ve had go on to have distinguished careers, the scholarship we have produced, and the engagement we’ve had in projects,” said Gerald L. Neuman ’73, director of the Human Rights Program. “We are looking back but also forward to the problems of the day.”
After the luncheon and keynote address by Koh, which focused on the future direction of human rights advocacy, attendees listened to the two panels before a reception closed out the celebration.
For Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, who served as an adviser to the program at its inception, the celebration displayed the success of activists in bringing human rights issues to the forefront of public discourse.
“Human rights once upon a time was just a phrase, then it became a movement, then it became law, then it became something we talk about at dinner tables,” Minow said at the ceremony.
The program, which was founded in 1984 by law professor emeritus Henry J. Steiner ’51, was created as a center for human rights scholarship, but now includes an international human rights clinic, a visiting fellows program, and partnerships with other human rights groups on campus.
The Human Rights Program provides an experience for both theoretical research and practical advocacy, according to Philippa Greer, who graduated from the Law School’s LL.M. program last spring after writing for the Human Rights Review.
“The program here is quite collaborative, and it’s a good chance to explore ethical advocacy issues but also do practical work,” Greer said. “It’s important to have a community on campus that puts forward that career path.”
With seven members of the Law School faculty and six full-time clinical instructors, the program’s human rights clinic instructs about 40 students each semester.
Katherine A. Soltis, a third-year student at the Law School, said the clinic provided an opportunity to go to Brazil and work firsthand on a project.
“It really gives you a reason for being in law school,” said Soltis, who said she will pursue a career in public interest law, foregoing the corporate law path.
Additionally, the Human Rights Program is home to seven visiting fellows, who will be conducting research throughout the fall.

UPDATED: September 22, 2014, at 9:16 p.m.
The University’s highest-profile deanship, that of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will be renamed in recognition of the support of donors Paul B. Edgerley and Sandra M. Edgerley ’84.
University President Drew G. Faust told alumni of the change on Saturday at the Assembly, an annual meeting of donors to The Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences, which was closed to the media.
This marks the first time one of Harvard’s deanships has been named and comes just two weeks after the School of Public Health was renamed with a landmark $350 million gift by Gerald L. Chan. The size of the Edgerley gift has not been disclosed.
Michael D. Smith now holds the position of Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Edgerley family’s most recent gift will endow the deanship, providing salary and other administrative costs for the position. Including benefits, Smith earned $554,370 in 2012, the last year for which his salary has been reported.
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow holds the Morgan and Helen Chu Dean’s Professorship. But the University still considers the FAS deanship renaming to be the first of its kind given the professorship associated with Minow's chair.
“Paul and Sandy Edgerley have been so very generous with their time and resources in support of the University, and we are deeply grateful for their unwavering commitment,” Faust said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette. “The Edgerley Family Deanship is a fitting recognition of their efforts to help Harvard lead in research and teaching for generations to come.”
In a statement to the Gazette, Smith said he was “deeply grateful to Sandy and Paul for their support of my office and for partnering with me to advance priorities that will positively impact the entire FAS for generations to come.”
Smith could not be reached for comment on Monday. Paul Edgerley could not be reached for comment early Monday afternoon because he is travelling abroad.
The Edgerleys currently serve as co-chairs on a committee for both The Harvard Campaign and the Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences, which leads the FAS portion of the University-wide fundraising effort.
The Harvard Campaign has raised at least $4.3 billion in pledges and donations thus far, which is 66 percent of the $6.5 billion goal. The Campaign for Arts and Sciences is aiming to raise $2.5 billion.
Among other reasons, FAS leaders are looking to the campaign to sure up the body’s finances in the long term. In fiscal year 2013, FAS reported a $3.7 million deficit in its “unrestricted core operations.”
Paul Edgerley currently works as managing director of Bain Capital, a private-equity firm. Sandra Edgerley worked for more than a decade at Bain and Company, and now spends her time in Boston-area philanthropic endeavors.
News of the renaming caught many members of the Faculty of guard, they said, but not completely by surprise. Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Government, noted that even though FAS deanship renaming is unprecedented, it is common practice to honor donors with nomenclature.
“I don't find it very shocking. After all, the whole university is named after a donor, John Harvard, and I have a professorship that’s named after a donor, as do most professors now,” Mansfield said. “Who are you going to name things after if not wealthy people or famous people?”
Smith, who has held the deanship since 2007, will also retain his endowed title as John H. Finley Jr. Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

The NCAA rankings metric used to assess the academic performances of collegiate athletic programs and determine postseason eligibility gave eight of Harvard’s varsity teams scores below the average compared to those programs at other private institutions over a four-year span. On the flip side, 20 Crimson squads earned perfect marks for the 2012-2013 school year, up from 15 a year ago.
This year’s Academic Progress Rate measurements, which were released by the NCAA this past May, are calculated out of 1,000 points and measure the performance of individual varsity athletic teams. According to the NCAA website, the ranking is “a team-based metric that accounts for the eligibility and retention of each student-athlete, each term.”
The data included in the most recent rankings covers the four seasons from 2009-2010 through 2012-2013 and includes a four-year rolling average submitted by each institution that the NCAA uses to determine postseason eligibility.
In addition to five of the six same teams—men’s basketball, men’s skiing, men’s tennis, women’s skiing, and women’s tennis—that posted below average scores in last year’s report, three more joined the list in the most recent report, with men’s hockey, men’s water polo, and field hockey dipping below the average.
While the men’s basketball squad recorded a perfect score for the most recent period as predicted by the athletic department last year, the previous year’s low score led to the adjusted four-year average remaining below the NCAA average for private schools.
The most drastic change came from the men’s hockey team, which saw its score drop 93 points in a single year, from 991 in 2011-2012 to 898 in 2012-2013, after multiple players withdrew from the team for all or parts of the 2012-2013 school year. But because its four-year score is 974—44 points above the rolling tally of 930 needed to qualify for NCAA postseason competition—the team would have to record low scores for the next few years to incur possible NCAA sanctions.
While the severe decline in the men’s hockey team’s score may raise some flags on the surface, the numbers posted by the NCAA are not set in stone. The NCAA APR guidelines allow for schools to adjust previous years’ data if necessary, leaving the possibility for past scores to be recalculated. According to Michelle Hosick, the associate director of public and media relations at the NCAA, varsity teams can earn points for athletes returning after time away from school, which further deems the score temporary in many circumstances.
“Because of the ability of teams to earn delayed graduation points, [which are] additional points added to a team’s score because of student-athletes who return and graduate after leaving without a degree, and the possibility that the school can go back and adjust and/or correct data for other reasons, [the NCAA doesn’t] ever say a team has to earn [a certain] APR or it will face postseason ineligibility (or penalties, etc.),” Hosick wrote in an emailed statement.
Based on these provisions, the men’s basketball team should receive such points and see its score boosted after Brandyn Curry ’14 and Kyle Casey ’14 returned to the squad and graduated last spring following their withdrawals from Harvard for the 2012-2013 school year.
In a similar fashion, should men’s hockey return and graduate players that had previously left the team and withdrawn from the college, its score would rise accordingly.

The women’s rugby edition of “The Game” was a blowout from start to finish, as Harvard scored early and often to shut out home team Yale. Three Crimson rookies shined in their debuts and four seniors scored tries as Harvard cruised to a 54-0 victory over the Bulldogs (0-2, 0-2 Ivy) on Saturday afternoon in New Haven.
The win repeated last year’s shutout, an 84-0 trouncing of Yale, in Cambridge during the Crimson’s inaugural varsity season. Harvard (1-1, 1-1 Ivy) gained its first victory of the season after losing in the final minutes against Brown last Saturday.
Co-captain Brooke Kantor said the Crimson played “a little chaotically” in the first half but was still able to control the ball and improve as the game went on.
Harvard wasted no time getting on the scoreboard as Isabel Delaura, a freshman from Boston making her collegiate debut, scored a try on the Crimson’s first possession. Delaura, who had never played rugby before coming to Harvard, was able to score after several strong passes from her teammates.
Kantor attributed Delaura’s scoring success, and Harvard’s overall ability to move the ball up the field, to the overall group dynamic of veterans and rookies.
“We saw some really beautiful teamwork on the field,” Kantor said. “I think that is definitely what ensured our victory today and allowed us to walk off the field feeling as though we had really accomplished something.”
Sophomore Ina Kodra, another rookie, provided the Crimson with a lift during the second half. She disrupted many of Yale’s scrums and energized the Crimson defense.
“[Kodra is] a powerhouse,” Kantor said. “I’m so happy that she joined the team this year as a sophomore,”
The third rookie, first-year Rachel Chapman, who started the game at lock and played the entire contest, gained back key territory on kick receiving for Harvard. Recent additions to the Crimson have only been allowed to practice with the team for a week.
While the trio of Chapman, Kodra, and Delaura played key roles in the victory for the Crimson, it was the leadership of Taz Ramirez and the other Crimson seniors that ultimately carried Harvard to such a convincing win. As the Crimson’s scrum-half, Ramirez served as the vocal leader and focal point of the team’s offense, delivering strong passes from the backs to set up her teammates for tries and allowing Harvard to quicken its pace on offense as the game progressed.
“Taz, especially in the second half of the game, was being so much more demanding of us, like telling us to go into the ruck,” Kantor said. “She was getting the ball out super quick and her passes were great.”
Harvard was able to score nine tries, three from senior Lenica Morales-Valenzuela and one apiece from senior co-captains Kaleigh Henry and Kantor, senior Aniebiet Abasi, junior co-captain Hope Schwartz, who is also an active Crimson sports editor, sophomore Taciana Pereira, and freshman Delaura. The Bulldogs, who offer rugby only as a club sport, were no match for the Crimson’s control of the ball and the pace of play for the entire game.
Despite the large margin of victory, Kantor sees some areas of improvement that she and her teammates want to work on before their clash with Ivy foe Cornell next Saturday at Cumnock Field.
“I think this week we really need to focus on salivating the point of contact, both when we’re going into tackles and when we’re going into rucks,” Kantor said. “This week if we work on it, I think that we will be able to do that not just in the second half of our game but for the entire eighty minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team exploded for five goals against LIU-Brooklyn on Sunday in New York en route to its fourth shutout of the season, 5-0.
The Crimson (5-2-0), which scored only one goal in the three contests prior to Sunday afternoon, outshot the Blackbirds (0-9-0), 22-2. Harvard converted five of its 11 shots on goal for a 45 percent clip.
“It was nice to see the shots falling and the passes connecting,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “The last couple of games we’ve been close, but we haven’t been able to finish off our chances. So it was great to see things going our way today.”
The scoring started in the eighth minute, when co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby recovered a ball coughed up by LIU-Brooklyn’s defense and fired a shot past the goalkeeper from 18 yards out.
The Crimson fell into a rhythm after Casscells-Hamby’s goal. Just three minutes later, a header pass from sophomore forward Midge Purce set up junior forward Emily Mosbacher, who fired a shot from 10 yards out for her first goal of the year.
Mosbacher added a second goal in the 57th minute with a long-range strike that sailed over the goalie’s head to the far post.
“[Mosbacher’s] movement put her in really good positions and her finishing was excellent,” Margolius said. “Almost every shot she took was on frame. She’s been working really hard and it’s showing in her play.”
The Blackbirds managed to show some early offense and took the first shot of the game. In the fourth minute, sophomore forward Jenn Peters found an opening, but couldn’t get the ball past Crimson senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba.
The attempt turned out to be LIU-Brooklyn’s only shot on goal all afternoon. The team has struggled on offense throughout the season, scoring only two goals in its nine games. Today’s loss marked the seventh time that the Blackbirds have been shut out.
The Crimson’s early 2-0 lead enabled Harvard coach Ray Leone to substitute out many of his starters.
“This was huge for us,” Leone said. “Not only were we able to give other players great opportunities to get a substantial amount of playing time, but we were able to give starters a break in the action that they haven’t had.”
Even after five of the team’s starters came out in the 33rd minute, Harvard’s offense kept up the pressure in the remainder of the first half.
The Crimson took three shots on goal in the final 12 minutes of the period. Although LIU-Brooklyn junior goalkeeper Jessica Montrose saved the first two, she could not handle the third shot from senior midfielder Lauren Urke and Harvard went up, 3-0, heading into intermission.
“We’re a really deep team,” Margolius said. “So even when the starters came out, there was no difference in our energy level and quality of play.”
The Crimson continued to dominate in the second half with a combination of starters and reserves rotating in and out.
After Mosbacher recorded her second goal of the day in the 57th minute, Leone replaced the junior with sophomore forward Joan Fleischman. Within a minute of entering the game, Fleischman added a goal of her own to put Harvard ahead, 5-0.
The Crimson received contributions from throughout its lineup in the one-sided contest.
“We’re trying to be an overall strong team to [the point] where there is no focus on one individual player,” Leone said. “[The goals today] were scored by good teamwork, and that’s something we’re striving to do.”
Harvard will kick off its Ivy League season next weekend on the road against Penn. The Quakers finished second in the Ancient Eight standings last year, behind only the Crimson.
“I think going into Ivy League season we are starting to realize that every game and every minute of every game is really important in our preparation,” Margolius said. “So it was really great to see everyone bring that energy and that excitement the week before Penn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team continued its strong start to the season, claiming its first Ivy League win against rival Yale at home on Saturday. The Crimson now boasts a 5-0 record, the team’s best since 1976.
Harvard (5-0, 1-0 Ivy) dispatched Yale (1-4, 0-1 Ivy) by a score of 4-1 in its Ivy League opener, an achievement Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden attributed to hard work, better coordination, and an optimal balance between attack and defense.
“I think we are really connecting well,” van Herwaarden said. “I think the team has done a tremendous amount of work in the offseason, which allowed us to play the game that we want to play.”
Despite the Bulldogs’ aggressive play to start the game, Harvard remained in control for the majority of the contest, gaining a 10-1 shot advantage in the first half and finishing the game with a 19-5 margin.
“It was pretty good in terms of the score,” co-captain Catriona McDonald said. “But we are actually, despite the score, a little bit disappointed in the way we played because that was not actually as good as we hoped to play today…. We had about 19 shots, converting only 4 of those, and we had a lot of corners as well, so it was a little disappointing.”
McDonald scored the first goal for the Crimson at 17:08, her first tally of the season. The goal was assisted by junior Elizabeth Jacobson, who sent a pass from the end line directly in front of the goal, where a waiting McDonald easily slapped the ball into the back of the net.
“We have not been 5-0 in a very long time,” McDonald said. “We are hoping to keep up the trend at this phase.”
Harvard had another opportunity just before the intermission when the Yale goalie, Heather Schlesier, lost track of a rebound; however, Crimson senior Noel Painter’s shot from the right bounced off the post.
Schlesier had a number of excellent saves in the rest of the game, but the Crimson remained relentless.
Sophomore Marissa Balleza took advantage of a penalty corner by teammate Sarah Finnemore in the 9th minute of the second period, doubling Harvard’s lead. The goal was assisted by freshman Ellie Cookson, whose assists helped the Crimson take down Maine last week.
Yale midfielder Kelsey Nolan closed the gap for the Bulldogs in the 54th minute, scoring unassisted from the inside of the far post.
“We needed to stay in it. One thing in field hockey is that it is very easy for [your opponent] to get a goal and get back in a game,” van Herwaarden said. “Field hockey now goes really quickly, really fast, and we needed to stay in control.”
The Crimson stayed aggressive, scoring again seven minutes after the Yale goal when Cookson collected another assist, sending an end line pass to senior forward Kaitlyn Boudah, who tallied her second score of the season.
Jacobson added the final touch to Harvard’s victory, posting her first goal of the season in the 67th minute.
Although only 11 players are playing on the field at each given time, van Herwaarden said that all 22 players on the Harvard field hockey team have contributed to the team’s success.
“We can find each other more easily this year,” van Herwaarden said. “We have more competitive spirit. There are 22 athletes competing for every practice, which raises for us the bar every single week, or maybe even every single day, and eventually helps us to prepare for the games.”
After a disappointing 2013 campaign, the Crimson hopes to keep the momentum from its undefeated start going.
“It is a really exciting time for the team because we have had a lot of transition in the past few years, coaching changes, a lot of things that we had to get through,” McDonald said. “Now it is kind of all coming together…after all the time we put in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off its first win of the season Tuesday, the Harvard men’s soccer team (3-3-0) picked up right where it left off this weekend, scoring seven goals and earning two victories over Hartford (3-2-1) and Manhattan (1-3-1).
HARVARD 3, MANHATTAN 0
Despite being held scoreless at the half, the Crimson continued its recent offensive success in Cambridge on Sunday, exploding for three second half goals en route to a 3-0 victory.
Sophomore midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu provided what proved to be the winning goal for Harvard in the 49th minute. The sophomore initiated the attack himself, intercepting a pass on the left wing and sending senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi on a run up the field.
Kobayashi directed a low pass into the box, which was initially knocked away by Jaspers’ keeper Alex Coates McDowall. But Wheeler ran onto the ball in the midst of some defensive confusion and finished a shot into the right side of the net to put the Crimson on top.
“We’ve [always] had that killer mentality on defense, and we’re finally translating it into offense,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “Everyone’s pushing us forward when we’re in the box trying to score, and that positive attitude in the final third is pushing us over the edge right now.”
The Harvard back line managed to limit the Manhattan offense to just four shots on goal for the game. Crimson goalkeeper Evan Mendez saved all four, earning his first clean sheet of the season.
“It was a good performance from Evan,” said Harvard assistant coach Jonathan Delano. “We’ve been working really hard as a group trying to tighten [the defense] up and come away with a clean sheet.”
Although one goal was all the support Mendez would need, the Crimson received an insurance goal from an unlikely source to lock up the win.
Up by one score in the 60th minute, freshman midfielder Sam Brown curled a free kick into the box, where it dipped past several crashing Harvard attackers, catching the goalkeeper by surprise.
The ball may have skipped into the net by itself, but junior co-captain Mark Ashby left no doubt about it, heading the ball into the upper left corner for his second goal in as many games.
Rounding out the scoring for the Crimson was junior forward Jake Freeman, who beat the keeper on a second chance opportunity in the 70th minute.
HARVARD 4, HARTFORD 1
In the team’s first contest of the year at Ohiri Field on Friday, the Crimson defeated Hartford, 4-1.
“I was really happy with the whole performance, both offensively and defensively,” Ashby said. “Hartford’s a good team, but I thought we really shut them down in all ways. Really dominated them.”
In the victory, Harvard fired 22 shots at the Hawks, twelve of which were on target. Consequently, the Crimson put four balls into the back of the net for the first time since 2009.
Harvard played with a lead for nearly the game’s entirety after opening the scoring in the eighth minute. After freshman forward Tyler Savitsky sent a cross deep into Hartford territory, Kobayashi headed home a ball from Wheeler-Omiunu for his first connection of the season.
In addition to Kobayashi, the other three goal-scorers also all earned their first tallies of the year. And for one important member of the Crimson, the goal was the first of his career.
Shortly after Hartford cut the lead to 2-1 early in the second half on a goal from senior defenseman Connor Yeaney, Ashby earned his chance—one that he considered “a long time coming.”
Running up the left sideline, freshman midfielder Christian Sady curled a ball into the box, finding junior midfielder Tim Schmoll. Schmoll redirected the ball towards the captain, who capitalized on a diving header, effectively putting the game away for good.
Also getting on the scoreboard for the Crimson were junior attacker Oliver White and senior midfielder David Barna. Both goals were assisted by Savitsky, with White scoring on a breakaway late in the first half and Barna finding an opening in the box in the 73rd minute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conner Hempel. Wow. That offensive line. Jeez.
That’s the best way to describe the Harvard football team’s season-opening 41-18 win against Holy Cross on Friday. Sometimes, verbs aren’t necessary.
Hempel had just two incompletions in the game—one on a miscommunication with Seitu Smith II and another on his first pass after missing two quarters of play with back spasms.
I think Crimson coach Tim Murphy will forgive those.
Hempel was perfect on his other 11 passes, including two touchdown tosses, as he gained 137 yards through the air. Why not more? Well, there were no more yards to gain. The Crimson scored a touchdown on every drive Hempel led. Really. Every drive.
Six plays, 47 yards, touchdown. 11 plays, 64 yards, touchdown. One play, 18 yards, touchdown. Five plays, 52 yards, touchdown. Eight plays, 88 yards touchdown. Harvard win.
That type of offensive perfection is rare, like a class with a five overall on the Q guide and a one workload, or like an open party at the A.D. Friday’s attack was also inevitable, like the fact that, unavoidably, you will somehow not get into either.
Harvard was bound to dominate because of the quality of the only five starters who never show up in the box score. You should learn their names.
Junior left tackle Adam Redmond, senior left guard Michael Mancinelli, senior center Nick Easton, senior right guard Anthony Fabiano, and junior right tackle Cole Toner.
They gave up just one quarterback hurry Friday and were even better on running plays. With junior Paul Stanton hurt, senior Andrew Casten never went down for zero or negative yards. The line gave him a hole to run through on all 17 of his carries.
Casten converted those into 153 yards and three touchdowns. His blockers helped turn last year’s safety valve into this year’s pipeline.
Hempel did the same thing with his receivers. Junior Andrew Fischer was just an option last year. He was the go-to guy Friday. Sophomore Anthony Firkser, sophomore Ryan Halvorson, and junior Bryce Walker combined for six more catches Friday than they had in 2013.
Harvard was without last year’s leading rusher, Stanton, and two leading pass-catchers, Cam Brate ’14 and injured senior Ricky Zorn. It had Hempel and the offensive line though, so those losses did not matter.
A consistent defense helped, too. Senior Zach Hodges made his presence felt with a drive-ending sack on Holy Cross’ third play and then went about being the “non-statistical force” he says he wants to be.
As Holy Cross sent multiple blockers his way on almost every play, the linebackers had more freedom. Juniors Matt Koran and Eric Medes took advantage by forcing a fumble each and combining for 18 tackles.
Their fumble recoveries on back-to-back drives in the second half helped keep Harvard’s touchdown streak alive.
But here comes the but.
They say first impressions are all-important. They are wrong.
Try to remember how this column started, for instance. For a harder challenge, recall the first game of Harvard’s 2011 football season.
Holy Cross beat the Crimson in that game, 30-22, as Collier Winters ’12 threw two interceptions. Winters threw just two more picks the rest of the year as Harvard ran the table to finish 9-1.
A year earlier, in 2010, the Crimson beat the Crusaders 34-6 to start the year, but then lost three games to tie Murphy’s worst record since 2000.
First impressions briefly seem important because they are the only impression at that time. More, better evidence comes later. The most recent impression is the most accurate, and the last one is the most important.
The corners of the 2014 Harvard football puzzle have been laid, but nobody’s eyes go to the corners of a picture first. A lot of questions remain unanswered.
Fischer and Smith can be explosive on the outside, and other receivers showed the ability to get open between the hashes, but it is still unclear who Hempel can go to when he needs someone to make a contested catch, for example.
On the other side of the ball, Harvard’s secondary was able to get away with giving Holy Cross receivers a lot of cushion in order to avoid a big play over the top. That strategy will not work against some of the quicker-hitting offenses in the Ivy League. The young crop of corners will eventually be tested.
But there is no need to judge those positions now. Strengths and weaknesses there and across the roster will become apparent as Harvard fights through its Ivy schedule starting next week. Or, if you prefer analysis of the verbless variety:
Week one win. Now what?

Happy Monday! Here are some signs that it’s the start of a new week:
1) You set about 20 alarms for Monday morning all within 2-minute intervals.
2) You skip lunch with friends because you have to “finish a reading” when in truth you’re going for that prime mid-day nap.
3) You pretend you’re texting as you’re walking to class because you’re too tired/grumpy/irritated/literally any other adjective that’s fitting for a Monday morning to be social and say "hi" to people.
4) You prematurely think your day is over and you accidentally skip your evening section because you basically forgot what classes are over the weekend.
5) You say you’re going to stay up late to do all that work you had originally planned to do this weekend but never actually, but end up justifying going to bed at 9 p.m. because it’s “Monday."
