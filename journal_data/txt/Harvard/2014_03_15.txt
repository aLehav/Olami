After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset.Here, we take a look at the No. 15 North Carolina Tar Heels from the ACC.
Record: (23-8, 13-5 ACC)
Best Wins: #3 Louisville, #1 Michigan State, #5 Duke, #11 Kentucky
Worst Losses: Belmont, UAB, Miami
RPI: 20
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 23
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 4
Star Players: Marcus Paige (So. Guard) 17.1 ppg, 4.5 apg, James Michael McAdoo (Jr. Forward) 14.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg
As the tournament approaches, bracketologists often revert to the transitive property to help pick upsets. If this property has any glimmer of verity, Harvard could be projected to beat North Carolina, as the Crimson’s margin of victory over Boston College is greater than UNC. Additionally, the Tar Heels have even recorded losses against second-tier teams, such as Belmont and University of Alabama at Birmingham.
But these contests don’t give the full picture. That’s because UNC plays best when the lights are the brightest. On November 24, with the a national audience on ESPN, the Tar Heels exploded with a 93-84 win over #3 ranked Louisville behind 32 points from guard Marcus Paige.
And that wasn’t enough. North Carolina then trounced the No. 1 team in the country by double digits, Michigan State, on the road at the Breslin Student’s Center. Once again the Tar Heels were explosive on national television, showing the country that its early losses were a fluke. UNC then marched into Lexington and beat #11 Kentucky to continue its hot streak.
But the Tar Heels are still beatable, as losses to unranked Texas, Wake Forest, and Miami mar its schedule. The key to shutting down UNC will be containing Paige. The sophomore averages 17.1 points per game, leads his team in assists, and is incredibly efficient with a 44% field goal percentage. Harvard’s own sophomore standout, Siyani Chambers, would likely draw this defensive assignment if the two meet.
Though Paige may lead the team in scoring, the real mismatch will be junior forward James Michael McAdoo. A serious NBA prospect, McAdoo stands at 6’9’’ and averages 14.2 ppg. McAdoo, who came to college as the #5 players in the country according to ESPN, is one of the most explosive players in the country, as he can handle the ball, attack the basket, and score in bunches. However, McAdoo has flown under the radar of many college basketball fans this season, as ESPN’s Jeff Goodman tweeted that the junior “has gone from overrated to underrated.” The only player on Harvard’s roster with the size, strength, and athleticism to guard McAdoo is freshman Zena Edosomwan (6’9’’). Edosomwan would have his hands full though, as he has only averages 5.7 minutes per game and is not nearly as developed as McAdoo.
The size of North Carolina extends beyond McAdoo, as sophomore forward Brice Johnson towers at 6’9’’ and forcefully protects the rim. Though Harvard has athletic big men in junior Steve Moundou-Missi and senior Kyle Casey, both only measure at 6’ 7’’. The absence of junior center Kenyatta Smith would play a huge role in the outcome of this contest, as his size would be terribly missed in the paint and on the glass.
Nonetheless, perhaps the greatest matchup to watch will be on the sideline. UNC’s head coach Roy Williams is a mastermind. Williams has coached the ACC powerhouse for over a decade, winning two National Championships and visiting the Elite Eight six times—not to mention his 14 tournament appearances as head coach of Kansas. On the other side of the hardwood will be Tommy Amaker, who is no stranger to the Tar Heels. As a player and assistant coach, Amaker starred in the Tobacco Road Rivalry for Duke. Amaker has revitalized Harvard’s program, bringing the Crimson from anonymity into the national spotlight. If these two teams are slated to meet, the chess match between Williams and Amaker, two former rivals, will have intrigue written all over it.
Though beating UNC would not be as a big of an upset as Harvard pulled off last year against highly-touted New Mexico, a win would certainly leave many people with busted brackets. With the three-point shooting of senior co-captains Laurent Rivard and Brandyn Curry, it shouldn’t come as a shock if the Crimson knock off the Tar Heels and make a push towards the Sweet 16.

But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset.Here, we take a look at UMass Amherst from the Atlantic 10.
Record: (24-7, 10-6 A 10)
Best Wins: #19 UNM, #23 VCU,
Worst Losses: St. Bonaventure, Richmond, George Mason
RPI: 16
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 48
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 8
Star Players: Chazz Williams (Sr. Guard) 15.6 ppg, 7.0 apg, Cady Lalanne (Jr. Center) 11.7 ppg, 8.0 rpg
Sampson Carter is a name that most people won’t know before they fill out their brackets this year. In fact, the only real storyline about the senior heading into March Madness is that older brother, Shyrone Chatman, is his assistant coach. But if Harvard draws UMass Amherst in the first round, you can be sure Carter’s name will be weighing on the minds of Crimson fans for much more than his family ties.
In Harvard’s opening game of the 2012-2013 season, the squad traveled to UMass to take on the Minutemen on ESPN. Having already been thrust into the spotlight as a result of last season’s cheating scandal, the game drew a wide audience. Nobody probably remembers the result better than junior wing Wesley Saunders. With just 1.2 seconds remaining, the then junior Carter drilled a three in the face of Saunders. The play was broadcasted repeatedly on SportsCenter the following day, serving as a welcoming mat for the drama that is college basketball.
Now, a year later, Carter is a senior playing and no higher than the third option on his team. Saunders is the Ivy League Player of the Year, and nothing would be sweeter for the versatile guard than a chance at redemption. Saunders is now his team’s leading scorer for the second consecutive season and nearly unstoppable when he penetrates the lane.
UMass is led by senior guard Chaz Williams, who is averaging 15.6 points per game and posted a double-double when the two teams last met. Though undersized for the Atlantic 10 conference at 5’9’’, Williams is an explosive floor general who shines brightest when the cameras are on. For a team that hasn’t been to the tournament since 1998, Williams is revered on campus and by the UMass faithful. ESPN.com’s Chad Ford even projects Williams as a late second round pick in the draft.
Stopping UMass will mean stopping Williams. The assignment would likely go to Harvard’s sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers, the reigning Ivy League Freshman of the Year and named All-Ivy this season. Chambers certainly has the quickness to keep up with Williams, but Williams can be more electric at times. It is tough to garner any true knowledge about the matchup from their previous contest, as Chambers was a freshman, starting his first collegiate game in a season where he had barely expected to see the floor. Offensively, Chambers has greatly developed greatly over the past two season, and, with four inches over Williams, could look to take him to the basket with his left hand that has become so feared in the Ancient Eight.
Nonetheless, while Williams may be undersized, his teammates don’t fit the description at all. Williams is surrounded by junior forwards Cady Lalanne (6’10’’) and Raphiael Putney (6’9’’). Both big men average close to double-doubles and can make driving the lane very difficult for the Crimson. Lalanne leads the team in shot-blocking and can cover a wide area of the paint. With junior center Kenyatta Smith out for the season, Harvard will have to lean on senior Kyle Casey and junior Steve Moundou-Missi, both of who would give up two inches. As a result, rebounding would have to be a team effort, with Harvard’s taller guards, senior co-captain Laurent Rivard and Saunders, looking to crash the boards.
UMass, which reached as high as #13 in the country, has shown the capability to run up the scoreboard, notching 80-plus in at least 14 contests. The key to beating the Minutemen would be slowing down the pace of play, something that Harvard is capable of when it needs to be. Chambers, who is often an extension of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker on the floor, is excellent at pushing the ball up the court and running through all of the offense’s progressions before attacking the basket. This offensive patience should let the Crimson limit UMass’s possessions and could take Williams out of any rhythm.
While UMass did have an impressive win against No. 19 University of New Mexico (which Harvard beat in last years tournament), the Minutemen lack any other quality win. In fact, their high-octane offense has even fallen off as of late, as No. 17 Saint Louis showed that efficient shooting and closing out on three pointers can limit UMass’s offense. Harvard has the length on defense to compete, which could make this game a very tight contest. Either way, you can be sure that a part of Saunders and his Crimson are hoping to draw UMass, with revenge on their minds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The popular narrative of senior Kyle Casey, one of the two athletes publicly connected to last year’s Government 1310 cheating case, has reached the redemption arc.
After negotiating a year of criticism and missing out on his team’s dream-come-true of pulling off an NCAA Tournament upset, Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry incorporated themselves back into the Harvard community and successfully defended their team’s Ivy title, giving the pair another shot at donning the glass slipper.
But to simplify the story to those terms would be to hide the transformation that Casey has had to undergo and the things he has to give up to ensure that the team dynamic cultivated last season would not be upset.
Kyle Casey has never been one to do things quietly. Flash back to March 5, 2011—perhaps his best game as a member of the Crimson. With a share of the Ancient Eight title on the line against Princeton, Casey shot 9-of-13 from the floor, putting up a season-high 24 points, two of which came on a baseline, and-one dunk over a Tiger defender that sent Lavietes Pavilion into a frenzy that actually damaged a portion of the bleachers. Everything about his play that night was loud.
Until August 2012, there was no indication that it would get any quieter. Casey’s career trajectory was linear, and always rising: honorable mention All-Ivy his freshman year, second-team All-Ivy the next year, and first-team All-Ivy his junior season. After the 2011-2012 campaign that brought Harvard to its first NCAA tournament since 1946, Casey was named the team’s most valuable player. The year off in 2012-2013 was not just a missed season—it was supposed to be his season.
A lot changed in a year. The squad that Casey returned to was one in which he would be just another piece, rather than the central piece. Junior wing Wesley Saunders and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers, who had contributed next-to-nothing and nothing, respectively, on the Crimson teams Casey had been a part of, were now first-team All-Ivy players in their own right. Casey would no longer be expected, or even asked, to carry a heavy load on offense.
But to listen to Casey tell it, his reduced role on the offensive end of the floor has been practically a no-brainer—there are other stars on the Harvard roster that need the ball in their hands, too.
“You got to do what’s best for the team,” Casey said. “Honestly, Wes has just emerged as a great player, a prolific scorer when he puts his mind to it. He’s just one of the best all-around players in the country. When you’ve got that and someone leading your team like that as far as an offensive standpoint, sometimes it’s just best to skip a good [shot] and get a great one.”
Hearing a player who seems always poised to add another clip to his highlight reel, who his coach describes as aiming for the “spectacular” play, speak so deferentially about his individual success can make one wonder what is really going on inside his head. But while Casey acknowledges his personal performance as important, his continued insistence on winning being the most important thing comes off as sincere.
“My individual success is definitely something I think about and definitely something I work hard for, and I’m not going to sit here and say I don’t, but you don’t really get that without winning,” Casey said. “There are very few players that get that from losing. Winning makes everything feel better. It makes everything look better.”
In assessing Casey’s final season in a Harvard uniform, his numbers do not look appreciably different than those of his previous seasons. He averaged 10.0 points and 5.7 rebounds per game in 2013-2014, compared to 11.4 points and 5.5 rebounds in his first-team All-Ivy 2011-2012 season—numbers that, by his standards, were earned pretty quietly.
Confidence has always been one of Casey’s strongest assets. It is easy to see how that confidence could be reduced when an opposing crowd could pull out the “Cheater!” trump card at any moment, as opposing Ivy student sections have done all season. But to hear Casey call out “Bucket!” in a practice shooting drill, or see him dance to his headphones into Lavietes, is to know that confidence will never be his problem. If he seems a little more subdued now, it is more likely a sign of what a year’s worth of personal growth can do to a person.
“I’m a fifth-year senior now,” Casey said. “I’m mature enough to know that winning is the goal. You just got to take the little steps to get there, whatever it is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The appeal of March Madness lies in its unpredictability. The odds of filling out a perfect bracket are worse than 1 in 100 billion, which you recognize to be true every year on the first Friday of the tournament when your surefire Final Four pick is upset by the No. 15 seed.
But with the rise of data analytics in basketball, some of that unpredictability has been mitigated. Now, it’s possible to see a little more clearly which out-of-nowhere teams were actually Cinderellas-in-waiting all season.
In March 2012, John Ezekowitz ’13 authored a post on the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective’s blog identifying which factors were most predictive of an underdog pulling off an upset in the NCAA Tournament. Ezekowitz examined all second-round (née first-round) upsets in the tournament from 2004 onward and tested various team statistics to see which correlated most with a team’s knocking off a favored opponent.
The two primary areas of the game that Ezekowitz’s model identified as key to an upset were turnovers and rebounding. Intuitively, the importance of turnovers makes sense; to defeat a more talented team, one’s best chance is to resort to high-risk, high-reward tactics. One could also see how rebounding could assume additional importance in a one-game elimination scenario, providing extra scoring opportunities on the offensive end and reducing those extra chances for the opponent.
So how does the Harvard men’s basketball team fit the profile of a dangerous underdog? Fairly well, as it turns out. The Crimson ranks 23rd out of 351 Division 1 teams in opponent turnover percentage, forcing takeaways on 20.9 percent of possessions. Harvard also does an excellent job on the defensive glass, rebounding of 74.8 percent of its opponents’ misses, good for 22nd in the country. The Crimson does not do quite as good of a job taking care of their ball (113th in turnovers per possession) or on the offensive boards (111th), though they are well above average nationally in both categories.
Harvard is also dangerous in another category important for high-variance performance: three-point shooting. Though the Crimson attempts only 14.9 three-pointers per game (311th in the country), the team shoots 39.0 percent from deep, which puts them 24th in the nation.
Once the team discovers its second-round matchup, Harvard’s odds of pulling an upset will likely be higher than they were last year, when the Crimson knocked off No. 3 seed New Mexico. The two most mainstream data-driven ranking systems, compiled by Jeff Sagarin and Ken Pomeroy, rank Harvard as the nation’s 35th and 33rd best team, respectively. At the end of 2013, even after the Crimson knocked off the highly-touted Lobos, Harvard placed 87th and 92nd by the same metrics. Though much of its upset hopes will hinge on the particular matchups it faces with its second-round opponent, the Crimson should approach the contest with confidence, knowing it has the quality to play with whomever it draws.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The central thesis of Malcolm Gladwell’s David and Goliath is that the best underdogs employ risky, high-variance strategies if they are to stand the best chance of knocking off a heavy favorite; in essence, they need all their big gambles to pay off. In a similar vein, the weakest favorites also tend to be high-variance squads—playing an average game would typically be enough to dispatch any pesky underdog, but a subpar performance could open the door to an upset.
All the major bracket projections—ESPN, USA Today, and CBS Sports—have the Harvard men’s basketball placed as either an 11 seed or a 12 seed in the NCAA Tournament. With that in mind, one can look at eight possible Crimson opponents using the most recent five and six seeds in ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi’s latest bracket.
The Crimson assessed all eight using five categories—three-point shooting frequency, three-point shooting frequency allowed, defensive rebounding percentage, offensive rebounding percentage, and opponent turnover percentage.
Below are the results for the eight teams Harvard is most likely to face. All numbers are percentages—OREB/DREB refer to percent of offensive (defensive) rebounds possessed, Op. TO% refers to the percentage of opponent possessions that ended in turnovers and (Op.) 3P Frequency refers to the percentage of (opponent) possessions ending in a three.
 


8. VCU: The Rams are the definition of the team Harvard does not want to play. The second-best team at walling off the three-point line, VCU’s “Havoc” defense would provide a full-court pressure Harvard has not seen all season. The Rams rebound the ball well on the offensive end (second-best in the sample) and force turnovers on an lofty 25.2 percent of opponent possessions. Stay away.
7. Ohio State: Fans of the Crimson may remember Harvard narrowly avoided the Buckeyes last year, and the Crimson will likely want to again. Not only are the Buckeyes a feisty defensive team with a perfect Siyani Chambers antidote in senior point guard Aaron Craft, but they close up the three-point line better than any other team in the sample. This team was ranked within the top five before a string of disappointing late-season losses and remains dangerous.
6. Kentucky: A matchup with the Wildcats would draw a lot of youth versus experience discussions given that of Kentucky’s main rotation includes just one upperclassman while among Harvard’s top seven players, just one is an underclassman. However, the real matchup would be on the glass. Behind likely top-five NBA draft pick freshman Julius Randle, the Wildcats get after the offensive boards. They don’t shoot a lot of three-pointers but defend the arc well, making them a fairly low variance team. Although Princeton nearly knocked off the Wildcats three years ago, don’t expect Harvard to be looking for Big Blue this year.
5. North Carolina: Although a high-variance team all year, the Tar Heels appear to have caught fire at the right time. Minus a couple of late-season losses to Pittsburgh and Duke, UNC has won 13 of 16 coming into the Dance with wins over Michigan State, Kentucky, Louisville, and Duke. They allow a lot of threes, but rebound the ball well and mostly shoot twos on the offensive end behind sophomore Marcus Paige and junior James McAdoo. Although not a terrible matchup—this team did, after all, lose to Belmont and UAB—better ones await the Crimson.
4. Oklahoma: The Sooners are as nondescript as any team in the sample. Oklahoma is an average rebounding team that cannot force turnovers (third-worst in the sample) and takes a fair amount of threes. In many respects, it is similar to New Mexico but comes in ranked as the 29th best team by KenPom—second worst in the sample and only four spots higher than Harvard—and so is clearly overrated as a projected five seed.
3. Connecticut: Harvard may have lost to UConn earlier this year, but the result comes with a big asterisk—the injury to junior Wesley Saunders. Without Saunders on him, Naismith Award nominee Shabazz Napier shook free for two late threes to seal a closely-fought game. Had Saunders played, the result looks like it could have been much different. UConn is a particularly poor rebounding team and is not excellent at forcing opponents off the three-point line. Throw in Harvard’s built-up frustration after a number of close losses to the Huskies, and you have a tasty Crimson matchup.
2. New Mexico: Running back last year’s second-round game could end with similar results. With the graduation of Alex Kirk, New Mexico’s lone inside threat is Cameron Bairstow. While it posts adequate defensive numbers, it forces turnovers on a meager 14.7 percent of possessions and cannot chase opponents off the free throw line. After Harvard killed the Lobos with an efficient offense that yielded open look after open look for co-captain Laurent Rivard (five threes during the contest) last year, little appears to have changed.
1. UCLA: The tastiest matchup for Harvard would reprise the coaching duel from last year. UCLA coach Steve Alford, who notably took out Harvard coach Tommy Amaker in his final college game while Alford played for Indiana and Amaker for Duke, was on the wrong end of last year’s Crimson first-round triumph and carries a weak UCLA team into the tourney. The Bruins, a poor offensive rebounding team, allow opponents to shoot three-pointers at a sky-high 34.4 percent rate. Against Rivard and company, that’s a recipe for disaster.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
If the 2012-2013 Harvard basketball season started with scandal, the 2013-2014 squad started with expectations. The preseason storylines for the Crimson centered around the return, not the departure, of senior Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry. After adding the returning All-Ivy senior talents and top-100 recruit freshman Zena Edosomwan, the murmurs were not of the team winning the Ivy League, but of going undefeated.
 
A year after losing four-fifths of the starting lineup to graduation or departure, the Crimson entered the 2013-2014 season with four-fifths of its starters returning, and the only loss—Christian Webster ’13—was coming back to the bench as an assistant coach. Harvard went four-deep in the frontcourt with juniors Kenyatta Smith, Jonah Travis, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Casey. If first-team All-Ivy starter Siyani Chambers sat, the team brought Curry—selected to the 2011-2012 All-Ivy League Second Team—off the bench. The remaining two projected starters? Last year’s leading scorer junior wing Wesley Saunders and the school’s best-ever three-point shooter, co-captain Laurent Rivard.
 
For all the talent that would take the floor, there was twice as much hype.
 
The Associated Press ranked the team 31st in the nation before the season’s inception. It was the unanimous selection to finish atop the league in the conference’s preseason poll—the first since the 2009 Sweet Sixteen Cornell squad to garner such honors. Others were willing to go farther. ESPN writer John Gasaway picked Harvard to make the Final Four.
 
“The expectations are going to be much higher,” Curry said before gameplay began. “We are going to have people coming after us this year.”
 
Amaker, however, was quick to disagree. Without a win on the court, Harvard’s head coach was unwilling to anoint his team. The same man who claims to never read a single “Bracketology” report during the season dismissed the hype as speculation.
 
“It’s assumed that whoever the favorite is [will] waltz through the league,” said Amaker prior to the season. “But it’s never happened since I’ve been a part of it.”
 
“We have our set identity, our set standards, and our set goals—they don’t change,” he continued. “Our players know them by heart, and we don’t compromise or negotiate with those three categories. Those are internal for us, and we’re never really worried or focusing or trying to listen to anything from the outside world.”
II. NONCONFERENCE PLAY
 
Five days before the Crimson took the floor for its first game against Holy Cross, it suffered its first setback. Smith, a defensive titan whose size and trustworthy hook shot had been essential to the Crimson’s run a year before, was out indefinitely. A stress reaction in his left foot had become a hairline fracture with overuse. Amaker’s preseason starting center wouldn’t return for two months.
 
Harvard barely missed a beat. Amaker put Casey into the starting lineup alongside Moundou-Missi, but it was Travis, the first reserve off the bench, who shined brightest in a season-opening 82-72 win over Holy Cross at the TD Garden. With 20 points and 10 rebounds in just 22 minutes of play, Travis established himself as the team’s spark plug off the bench.
 
“I know my job—to provide energy for the team,” Travis said after the win. “If they need me to grab rebounds, score points, or set screens, [then] that’s what I will do.”
 
The performance was emblematic of the two team strengths that Amaker has stressed all year: its bench and its balance. Five players finished in double digits, with the bench chipping in 31 of the team’s 82 points.
 
Both qualities stemmed from each player’s awareness of his role on the team. Before the season, Amaker’s staff affixed note cards to every locker detailing what each player would be counted on to do. Saunders was both the team’s best slasher and best perimeter defender. Casey was the vocal defensive leader and an effective passer from the high post.
 
However, Curry, dubbed the team’s “sixth starter” by Amaker, had his role interrupted by an ankle injury in the Holy Cross matchup. With Curry sporadically in and out of the lineup for the next two months, the Crimson found itself down two key players early.
 
Even with the Crimson’s “next man up” philosophy, the injuries took their toll in the biggest nonconference games. Harvard won three straight following the Holy Cross victory, and rolled into Boulder, Colo., in late November undefeated and confident.
 
The Buffaloes, which boasted potential NBA first-round draft pick Spencer Dinwiddie and an imposing front line of 6’10” Josh Scott and 6’7” Xavier Johnson, hung around the fringe of the nation’s top 25. Colorado’s victory over Kansas a couple weeks later would put it in the top 20.
 
The Crimson came out strong, hitting four early three-pointers en route to a quick 16-4 lead that became a 12-point halftime advantage. But with Casey in foul trouble (four fouls, 19 minutes played), Smith’s absence was keenly felt during a 14-0 Buffalo second half run. Harvard had just 20 points in the final period, and lost the game, 70-62.
 
From Colorado, the team flew to Anchorage for the Great Alaska Shootout. As the top seed, it expected—and, aside from a tight semifinal against Green Bay, received—little competition. Winning its three games by an average of 13.7 points, Harvard took home the title. It would not lose again until January, running off 10 straight wins in all.
 
But injuries struck again. Before the Crimson’s biggest nonconference game—on the road against Connecticut, a perennial regional power that had beaten Harvard four times in as many years—Saunders was declared out with injury. Despite 21 points and six threes from Chambers, the Crimson once again failed to hold a halftime lead. UConn outscored Harvard by 10 in the second half, and ultimately overcame the Crimson, 61-56.
 
Afterward, the team was quick to dismiss its leading scorer’s absence as the reason for the loss.
 
“When Wesley went down, we were just going to do it as a team,” Chambers said. “Somebody was going to step up.”
 
Saunders would miss three games, the last of which was the Crimson’s worst performance of the year. Facing Florida Atlantic University, whose coach, Mike Jarvis, had been passed up in favor of Amaker for the Harvard job seven years earlier, the Crimson shot just 23 percent from the field en route to a 15-point defeat. It was Harvard’s only double-digit loss of the season and, as the team prepared to enter conference play, it left a sour taste in the players’ mouths.
 
“It’s one of those games where you’re dumbfounded, a little befuddled,” Amaker said. “We haven’t been like that this year. We normally have had stretches where we haven’t played as well, but we’ve found ways out of it.”
 
III. A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN
 
For the last two years, the Crimson had to rely on the losses of other teams—Penn and Princeton—to clinch its berth in the NCAA Tournament. With the graduation of Tiger Ian Hummer ’13, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, the odds looked good for Harvard to nab the 2013-2014 Tourney bid without much trouble.
 
But Yale sophomore Justin Sears would emerge as a force in New Haven. Suddenly, what looked like an easy ride turned into a gritty Ivy season in which the Crimson had to continually look over its shoulder, glancing southwest to find out what happened at Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium.
 
In other words, at least for this season, the “Big Game” in the Harvard-Yale rivalry shifted from the gridiron to the hardwood, and which team would punch a ticket to the Big Dance largely came down to a single contest in the last weekend of the year.
 
But, to get to that position, Harvard first had to drive past the rest of the Ancient Eight.
 
The Crimson began its conference season with two games against Ivy travel partner Dartmouth. With an injury to Big Green star Gabas Maldunas in the squads’ first matchup—a 61-45 Harvard win—the second contest proved to be no contest at all, and Harvard took down the Big Green on the road, 80-50. It was two Crimson veterans that led the team in its opening series of conference play, as Curry totaled 31 points and 10 assists in the two games, while junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi notched 28 points and went a perfect 10-of-10 from the charity stripe.
 
Out of the 40 minutes of the second contest, two in particular seem to have had perhaps the greatest implications for the season. With 4:29 left in the second half and his team up by 31, Smith checked into his first game of the year, clocking 120 seconds on the floor. 
 
But five days after Smith played his first minutes of the season, it was announced that he would be out for the remainder of the year. The junior had apparently reinjured his foot, and the timeline for his return quickly shifted from “indefinite” to a permanent spot on the end of the bench.
 
“[It’s] very disappointing,” said Amaker on the Friday following the re-injury. “For him, first of all, and then very disappointing for our team, knowing that he was going to be an integral part of the season—of whatever success we were going to have—and now we don’t have him.”
 
The next weekend brought two opponents to Lavietes that typically give Harvard more trouble than the squad from Hanover: Princeton and Penn.
 
In a Friday game that featured high offensive efficiency—with both the Tigers and the Crimson shooting above 50 percent from the field—the home squad eked by its Ivy rivals with an 82-76 victory.
 
The win was anything but easy, however, as Harvard saw a sizeable lead cut down in the final minutes of play. Poor free throw shooting from the Crimson—which missed six shots from the stripe in the contest’s final 2:11—enabled Princeton to silence the loud Harvard crowd by cutting the Crimson advantage to four.
 
Despite Tiger co-captain T.J. Bray’s 26 points, Princeton was unable to capture the lead, and the Cambridge residents earned their third league victory, largely behind the offensive performance of their backcourt. Rivard knocked down six treys on the night, and soon-to-be Ivy League Player of the Year Saunders tallied 24 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists.
 
Penn posed little threat for Harvard on the following day, and for the second time in a week, the Crimson took down an opponent by a score of 80-50.
 
While Harvard relied on an abundance of offense in its first four conference games, the next weekend’s doubleheader against Brown and Yale proved to be of a grittier variety.
 
Although the Crimson outlasted Brown, 52-45, on Friday, despite shooting only 32 percent from the field, a second consecutive night of poor shooting doomed Harvard to its first loss of Ivy play, a 74-67 win for Yale.
 
The Bulldogs were led by sophomore forward Justin Sears, whose 21 points and 11 rebounds would prove only a preview for what was to come in the squads’ second matchup of the year. For the weekend, the Crimson shot just over 35 percent from the floor, almost 14 percentage points below its conference average.
 
“I anticipated it being one of the tougher games we would have,” Amaker said. “We have always thought of them as having great personnel…. They put on a tremendous effort to get a road win against us, something that doesn’t happen very often.”
 
After driving down to Columbia early on the following Thursday to avoid a snow storm, Harvard was forced to stay in New York City late, as a standout performance from Lions junior forward Alex Rosenberg spearheaded Columbia into a double-overtime, down-to-the-wire contest against the reigning Ivy champs.
 
Rosenberg totaled 34 points on the night, and a combined 14 points from him and teammate Maodo Lo in the final six minutes of regulation spurred a late Lions comeback. Rosenberg had his way both inside and out, backing down Crimson defenders in the post and converting 4-of-6 shots from behind the arc to lead his team into two rounds of extra minutes.
 
However, with the game clock running down in the first overtime, Rosenberg made contact with Rivard near the right elbow, and a whistle from the referee signaled an offensive foul on the junior, taking away a potentially game-winning basket. The visiting team was able to close it out from there, and left the Big Apple with an 88-84 victory.
 
“We felt that this was a critical game, [and] I think [Columbia] felt the same way,” said Amaker in the postgame press conference. “I think it was evident by how both teams played, how hard both teams fought for this victory.… [C]ertainly for us, I think to be able to turn the page from last weekend after a Saturday night loss at home, I thought this was a critical game.”
 
After cruising by Cornell on the following night, the Crimson hit the road for its annual Killer P road swing. It breezed past the Quakers on Friday night and made history on Saturday by taking down Princeton at Jadwin Gymnasium for the first time since 1989.
 
Fresh ink seeped into the record books as the victory over Princeton marked the first time in Harvard history that the squad swept the season series over both the Tigers and Quakers. 
 
“[In practice], we expressed to [the underclassmen] how meaningful it was [to win at Princeton],” said Curry after the win at Jadwin. “This is our last go-around, and the seniors before us did the same thing. You realize how much it means to you when you are there.”
 
Two wins over Cornell and Columbia during the following homestand would set up the biggest game of the year.
 
The Crimson and Bulldogs were about to face off, with a record night from Bulldog Sears waiting in the wings.
 
IV. THE GAME: HARDWOOD EDITION
 
Harvard headed to New Haven on March 7th with title implications in the air and Crimson fan buses on the road.
 
Harvard and Yale sat in the No. 1 and 2 positions in the Ivy standings: a Crimson win would clinch a league championship and an NCAA berth, while a Harvard loss would keep the Bulldogs in contention.
 
The game did not disappoint.
 
The visiting team jumped out to an early lead in the first half, punctuated by consecutive threes from Curry following “Cheater” chants from the Eli fans.  The Crimson led its rivals by 13 at intermission, holding Yale to only 23 points in the first 20 minutes.
 
But a dominant performance from Sears, who scored 28 of his team’s 58 points, pushed the Elis back into the contest. The sophomore went five-of-five from the field in the second half, collecting 15 points and nine rebounds in the game’s final period in an attempt to keep his squad’s title hopes alive.
 
Back-to-back scores from Sears—an and-one and a rim-shaking dunk—sliced the Crimson’s lead to only nine with 5:33 left in the game. Plenty of time remained for a Yale comeback.
 
Two Crimson treys, however, would be enough to put the Bulldogs back on their heels. First up was a three from Chambers, who ran a quick give-and-go with Casey, culminating in a 20-foot three-pointer from the top of the circle.
 
Then, with 2:18 remaining, a Rivard swish from the corner not only punched the game wide open for Harvard, but also punched the squad a ticket to the NCAA Tournament.
 
Minutes later, amidst cheers from the Crimson fan section and celebrations from the Harvard players, the final buzzer rang, indicating the team’s third consecutive outright Ancient Eight championship and berth in the Big Dance.
 
“I think we’ve shown that we have been the best team in our league,” Amaker said after the contest. “We never thought about pressure or expectations…. It’s been about the journey for us. We talked about and used this since the banquet of last year. When teamwork is the destination, victory happens along the way.”
 
V. MARCHING FORWARD
 
For a squad whose destination has been “teamwork” all season long, in just a few short hours, it will have a second destination to head towards.
 
Harvard will find out which team it will face in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Selection Sunday at 6 p.m. According to current projections, the Crimson will most likely be seeded in the No. 12 position. Harvard will be placed in one of eight possible Tournament locations, ranging from San Diego, Calif. to Buffalo, N.Y.
 
This week will mark the one-year anniversary of Harvard’s upset over the University of New Mexico, the first NCAA Tournament win in program history. Expectations for the Crimson have only grown since that night, and, riding an eight-game winning streak into March Madness, the spotlight will be on the Crimson wherever the game takes place.
 
Amaker, however, has maintained that history doesn’t matter when entering the Big Dance.
 
“I’ve always felt it’s not what you do going into the tournament, it’s what you do within the tournament,” said Amaker after his squad’s final conference win of the season against Brown last Saturday. “You never know what style you’re going to have to go against…[but] we’ve shown that we can line them up and play a lot of different ways, and not only play but be successful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s basketball team when it faced Yale on March 7th, the term “charity stripe” must have seemed a mischaracterization. Time after time, a Crimson player would step to the free-throw line, take several dribbles, and put up a shot.
Clank. Rim. “Long!”
The poor shooting seemed contagious, and every Harvard player who attempted a free throw on the night shot worse than his season average.
Except one.
While Ivy Player of the Year Wesley Saunders went 1-of-8 from the stripe, and last year’s Ancient Eight Rookie of the Year Siyani Chambers shot 55.5 percent from the line, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi connected at an 80 percent clip.
With the Yale crowd jeering in the packed Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Moundou-Missi walked to the line, received the ball from the referee, and paused, holding the rock on his left lip. He reached the ball around his back, grabbed it with his right hand, and dribbled a few times.
“I’ve got shooter!” “Box out!” Swish.
Early in the first half and late in the second period, Moundou-Missi converted from the line. Perhaps it was the wraparound-the-back part of his free throw routine that differentiated his time at the stripe from that of his teammates. But on an evening when no one else could knock down the only “free” shot on the court, the big man made it his duty to do so.
An hour later, after the final buzzer rang, when the rest of the Crimson celebrated its Ivy League title and NCAA Tournament berth with fist pumps and chest bumps, Moundou-Missi turned towards the Harvard fan section and began to applaud. Instead of celebrating his own victory, the forward was thanking the Crimson fans for their contribution.
Another twenty minutes passed, and Moundou-Missi was sitting at the postgame press conference. Not once in the duration of the interview did he say the word “I.” Instead, he said the words “group,” “together,” and “we” multiple times.
While Moundou-Missi is quick to credit his teammates for his own success, his 2013-2014 season statistics indicate that the forward has grown into his own during the course of the year. In his third Cambridge campaign, he leads the team in both rebounds and blocks per game (with 5.7 and 1.3, respectively), and averages over 25 percent more points per contest this season than last.
Despite the return of fellow big man senior Kyle Casey, Moundou-Missi’s minutes spiked over the course of the year, largely due to the season-ending injury of junior Kenyatta Smith. Moundou-Missi’s time on the hardwood jumped from 20.6 minutes per game in his sophomore year to 24.8 in his junior year, good for a 125-minute increase overall.
With the injury to Smith, an amplified amount of pressure was put on Moundou-Missi down low. And, according to his teammates and coaches, he delivered.
In the squad’s first league game of the season, Moundou-Missi tallied 16 points on 57 percent shooting from the floor, going a perfect 8-of-8 from the free-throw line—only once in the entire 2012-2013 season did Moundou-Missi score 16 points or more. He got to the line more than seven times in a single contest only once his sophomore campaign, and when he did he shot only 5-of-11, a far cry from this year’s charity stripe-conversion rate.
This season, Moundou-Missi has put up at least 16 points seven times, and scored over 20 points in four of those games. In the last three contests of the season, the junior put up 16, 16, and 21 points, respectively, earning Ivy League Player of the Week honors along the way.
With the Crimson’s frontcourt game radically altered due to the loss of Smith, it’s been largely up to Moundou-Missi and Casey to provide their team with the necessary bulk down low, on the offensive and defensive ends.
On Feb. 14th against a feisty Columbia team, the Crimson found itself down two with the game clock approaching zero. Saunders held the ball near the left wing, sliced into the lane, and missed the shot. Luckily for Harvard, Moundou-Missi lay waiting near the rim, hands up, ready for the put-back attempt.
With that bucket, Harvard forced overtime. And after a few more back-and-forths, the Crimson preserved its first-place standing in the league, prevailing over Columbia, 88-84.
“We’ve come to expect sensational efforts on the offensive end by some of our guys, but to see Steve play the way he played with a great deal of confidence—stepping up, making shots and getting on the glass—was the difference for us,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker after the game.
The following weekend, the Crimson traveled to Princeton to play the biggest game of its season to that point. The squad hadn’t won at Jadwin Gymnasium for over two decades, and not once in program history had it swept the season series against both Penn and Princeton. With Yale breathing down Harvard’s neck for the conference’s lead spot, the Crimson was forced to do what it hadn’t done in any of its players lifetimes: win at Princeton.
It was a rocky game for Harvard, and the Tigers took a quick lead in the opening minutes. However, some late game heroics from the Crimson’s backcourt—Chambers and co-captain Brandyn Curry—along with a double-double from Moundou-Missi brought Harvard back into the game and eventually earned it the win, 59-47.
It was the defensive effort though of Moundou-Missi that drew Amaker’s attention.
“With the way that Steve played for us, if you look at his line…he was sensational and he had to guard their bigs [Hans Brase and Will Barrett] out on the floor a lot,” Amaker said. “A tremendous effort out of Steve. For him to be able to play those kinds of minutes and not be in foul trouble, I’m very pleased with that.”
While Brase and Barrett both averaged double-digit scoring for the season, they were held on that night to a combined three points. The frontcourt duo went 1-of-10 from the floor, while Moundou-Missi controlled the paint with a game-high four blocks. The Tigers, meanwhile, tallied four blocks as a team.
And so it continued for the big man, whose statistics went up in almost every measurable category this year: field goal percentage, free-throw percentage, points, rebounds, assists, and blocks. When it counted the most, in a title-clinching game against Yale, Moundou-Missi came through once more, stepping to the line, curling the ball around his back, and knocking down shot after shot.
Before the team had taken the court this season, Smith had described Moundou-Missi as a “workhorse.” At that point, no one knew that the Cameroonian native would have to fill in for Smith in the middle. But, after the numbers that Moundou-Missi has put up in the last four months—including leading the Crimson in conference “win shares”—it seems that Smith’s designation of Moundou-Missi is truer than ever.
“I think the big change in my game is my confidence level,” Moundou-Missi explained in November. “I feel like this summer I practiced a lot and got confident taking some shots I didn’t take last year.”
Four months, 30 games, and over 300 points later, this surge in “confidence” and the newly found faith in his jumper paid off. It was Moundou-Missi who led the Crimson in field goal and free-throw percentage in that all-important game against the Bulldogs, and, when Harvard takes the floor in the NCAA Tournament this week, it will be Moundou-Missi starting down low for his team, anchoring it in the middle.

It’s spring break, but you know you miss the excitement of Housing Day. And in spite of the Kirkland Controversy, the Battle of the Beyoncé’s, the Battle of the “Adele Dazeems,” and the face-off between what the Moose says and what the Tree says, Harvard’s twelve houses got creative with their housing day videos this year. If The 2014 Housing Market or the Roving Reporter: Which is the Best House? did not give freshmen a full glimpse of which house is best, here’s a Housing Day videos ranking:
12. KirklandWell, although Kirkland’s “Kirkland Didn’t Start the Fire” video sure was a humorous hit, the initial Kirkland “album” didn’t turn out so well. Luckily Kirkland’s housing and location are better than its spontaneous album drop.
11. CurrierNot a huge fan of "What Does the Fox Say", so Currier's Housing Day video did not top the charts.
 10. Leverett Not even sure which Leverett rap song was its real Housing Day video, but either way, the songs that Lev chose to make a parody of were not too impressive. Tip for Lev: use a song with love in it for next year. Drunk in Lev or Lev on Top could’ve been even better than Lowell/Winthrop’s versions.
9. DunsterAgain, with the "What Does the Fox Say" but with a moose. But at least Dunster’s use of the moose mascot, a Scooby-Doo costume, and an adorable kid in a tiger costume was entertaining.
 8. QuincyAlthough the vocals in Pfoho’s take on “Let It Go” and Quincy’s rendition were both off the charts, Quincy’s actual music video was definitely not as impressive as Pfoho’s number one spot. The awkward photo sequence that played at random points throughout this Frozen parody was not very aesthetically pleasing.
 7. EliotEven for someone who doesn’t watch House of Cards, this Housing Day video was undeniably humorous and creative. Props to Eliot for being the only house this year not to do music video and get away with it.
6. CabotThere’s not much more to say than they’re happy. Since over half the people in Annenberg on Housing Day were rocking Cabot sweatbands, let’s hope the Cabot residents look like they have as much fun as they did in this video.
5. MatherUsing one of the Final Clubs’ top party songs as a music video only adds to the fun that was “Talk Mather to Me.” This Housing Day video not only features the Mather Gorilla and hilarious lyrics, but also the Matherites just look like they’re having a genuinely good time.
4. AdamsAdams already boasts some of the most desirable housing on campus, but its music video to Lorde’s “Royals” makes it all the more intriguing. The lyrics are genius and suit the house perfectly, and the vocals are top notch.
3. WinthropFor a house that doesn’t get much attention for great housing, Winthrop did a great job promoting its house with the ingenious “Love on Throp.” Just like Lowell, using a Beyoncé favorite basically sealed the deal for Winthrop in and of itself. Plus, apparently this was filmed in one take—major props.
2. LowellNothing can compete with Lowell’s “Get Lowell” Housing Day video from last year, which features its housemasters and Lowell’s own version of the Ying-Yang twins. Still, Lowell’s “Drunk in Lowell” was impressive enough to grab our attention. Of course using one of Beyoncé’s biggest hits was a nice touch, and the lyrics and title were quite intriguing. Honestly, though, the best part of “Drunk in Lowell” was its trailer.
1. Pforzheimer.This might come as a surprise, since it’s, you konw, the Quad. However, Pforzheimer (if that’s how it’s spelled) really turned up its game this year with its own take on Idina Menzel’s “Let It Go” from Disney’s “Frozen.” It isn’t too surprising that the PfoCo created one of the better Housing Day videos, after its “Hitler Gets His Housing Assignment” video four years ago, but nonetheless, Pfoho wins the award for best Housing Day video. This video not only boasts vocals that are arguably better than Princess Elsa’s, but also offers some of the best lyrics and video action to come from a Housing Day video. Though Quincy released their version of “Let It Go” well before Pfoho, Pfrozen was much more impressive in its lyrics and music video.
