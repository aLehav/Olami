After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supporters of Harvard’s graduate student union rallied in four cities around the country Wednesday morning to pressure members of the Harvard Corporation to support the union.
The protests occurred the same day as negotiators from Harvard and the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers convened for their first bargaining session since the union went on strike over two weeks ago.
Harvard alumni, students, and local supporters gathered at the offices of Corporation members in Boston, Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. around 9 a.m. Eastern time for the demonstrations.
The 13-member Harvard Corporation is the University’s highest governing body. A Wednesday HGSU-UAW press release notes that the Corporation members “have the power to direct the administration to reach a fair agreement.”
“Harvard’s intransigence is creating a widening crisis for the university,” Benjamin L. McKean ’02 wrote in the press release. “We began organizing solidarity actions in Boston, and immediately, alumni and supporters across the country wanted to join.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the protests; the four targeted Corporation members did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday morning.
HGSU-UAW has been negotiating with Harvard for its first contract for over a year and a half. After more than 90 percent of participating members voted in October to authorize a strike, members took to the picket lines on Dec. 3. They have remained on strike for 16 days – the longest graduate student union strike nationwide in recent years.
While HGSU-UAW and the University had agreed on 12 tentative provisions before Wednesday’s session, they remained at an impasse on key issues such as compensation, health benefits, and a grievance procedure to adjudicate sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. On Wednesday, the parties added six agreements to that total, though none related to the three key issues.
In Boston, protesters gathered at the office of Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, who is a partner at the law firm WilmerHale. Lee also served as the Harvard’s lead trial lawyer for a high-profile affirmative action lawsuit against the University’s race-conscious admissions policy last year.
Another group assembled in Chicago at the office of Treasurer of the Harvard Corporation Paul J. Finnegan ’75, who is also chair of the Harvard Management Company. Similar protests took place at the offices of Corporation members David M. Rubenstein and Timothy R. Barakett ’87, in Washington, D.C. and New York City, respectively.
Roughly 10 protesters gathered in the lobby of 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, which houses the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that Rubenstein co-founded. After several speeches from protestors, security guards asked the group to leave and the protest continued on the sidewalk outside.
Samuel S. Klug, a union organizer and History Ph.D. student, said at the Washington, D.C. rally that Rubenstein held responsibility for the University’s position at the bargaining table, asking him to advocate for the union to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
“We are here to say, David Rubenstein, Harvard Corporation member, you are personally accountable — personally responsible — for the fact that the Harvard administration has only agreed to one bargaining session after three weeks of this strike,” Klug said at the protest in the lobby. “We are here to say David Rubenstein, it is on you to tell Provost Garber, President Bacow, and other members of the Harvard administration that this will not stand.”
Paula J. Caplan ’69 said in an interview after the D.C. rally that she went upstairs to Rubenstein’s office, where she was told that Rubenstein was out of the office Wednesday. Caplan — who co-wrote a letter last month signed by 45 members of the Class of 1969 urging Harvard to improve pay and job security for graduate students and non-tenure-track faculty — said she was heartened by the protest Wednesday.
“It was really good to know that in various cities around the country, there were these simultaneous demonstrations of protest in support because what the Harvard administration is doing — or not doing — is really unconscionable,” Caplan said.
In Manhattan, approximately 15 people — including members of graduate student unions at Columbia and New York University — gathered outside of Barakett’s Office at Stabilis Capital Management. Four protesters tried to go upstairs to deliver a letter to Barakett, but security guards turned them away, according to Elizabeth C. “Liz” Vladeck ’99.
The group chanted in the lobby of the building, then in the plaza outside the building until they were asked to leave, at which point they continued the protest on the sidewalk.
As the New York rally concluded, the organizers said they would protest at the nearby Harvard Club next if the union’s demands are not met.
The three-hour bargaining session Wednesday comes more than two weeks after the parties’ last session on Dec. 2. In the last meeting, HGSU put forward a package of economic proposals with reduced ask on annual salary raises, support for student workers’ insurance premiums, among other topics. The union and the University scheduled Wednesday’s session last Friday, before which Harvard said it had been evaluating the union’s package.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tishman Speyer will serve as the “preferred developer” for the initial phase of Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus in Allston, according to a Thursday morning press release from the Harvard Allston Land Company.
The Enterprise Research Campus — a University project overseen by the HALC — is intended to serve as a venue for collaboration between Harvard-affiliated research projects and research companies. Spanning 36 acres, the ERC is located on Western Avenue next to the University’s Science and Engineering Complex and across the street from Harvard Business School.
The initial phase of the project involves the 14-acre portion of land that received initial regulatory approval from the Boston Planning and Development Agency in 2018 for 900,000 square feet. The first development stage includes plans for lab and office space, residential areas, and a hotel and conference center.
Tishman Speyer is a global real estate developer, operating more than three million square feet in Boston alone. In a press release Thursday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow referenced the firm’s portfolio when describing Harvard’s hopes for the future of the ERC.
“Tishman Speyer will bring to Allston a wealth of experience shaped by extraordinary work around the world, and we look forward to the further development of the Enterprise Research Campus,” he wrote.
Nitin Nohria, Chair of the Board of HALC and Dean of the Harvard Business School, said in the release that Tishman Speyer’s proposals aligned with Harvard’s goals in Allston.
“The ideas and concepts put forth by the Tishman Speyer team were very much in line with the local Allston community’s, the city’s, and the University’s goals for the neighborhood, as well as advanced and forward-thinking,” Nohria wrote.
The firm’s proposal describes plans to promote “inclusivity, shared experiences, collaboration and human happiness” through social infrastructure, per the release.
Tishman Speyer President and CEO Rob Speyer said in the release that his company was “proud” to serve as the project’s developer.
“This project will combine the best in real estate with the best in science to help entrepreneurs and researchers make life-changing discoveries,” Speyer wrote. “And it will do this while supporting the neighborhood’s residents, further strengthening existing businesses and diversifying the region’s economy.”
Jeanne Gang, the architect selected to lead the project, said in the release that the ERC will include “low-carbon buildings and resilient green spaces.”
The ERC plans to designate 20 percent of the land it develops as green space.
Thomas P. Glynn, CEO of the HALC, said in the release that the designation of Tishman Speyer as the preferred developer for this initial phase of construction is “an important next step in realizing Harvard’s vision for the ERC.”
“While a lot of necessary, expected work still remains to be done, we’re incredibly excited about this today’s announcement,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 19, 2019, at 9:12 p.m.
Harvard’s graduate student union and University administrators agreed to six tentative contract provisions during a bargaining session Wednesday — none of which include the three major points of contention at the heart of the union’s more than two-week-old strike.
The session was the two parties’ first meeting since members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers began their strike on Dec. 3. Harvard and HGSU-UAW, who had agreed on 12 contract provisions in 28 bargaining sessions prior to Wednesday’s meeting, remain deadlocked on critical provisions, including those related to compensation, health care, and grievance procedures to adjudicate claims of sexual harrassment and discrimination.
During Wednesday’s bargaining session, the University and the union reached tentative agreements related to discipline and discharge, strikes, grievance and arbitration, titles and classifications, an emergency grant, and housing, Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email.
The agreement on grievance and arbitration establishes a procedure for resolving violations of union members’ contractual rights, allowing union members to appeal to a third-party arbitrator. This contract provision is separate from grievance procedures for allegations of harrassment and discrimination — one of the union demands that remains at issue.
The tentative article related to discipline and discharge prohibits the University from disciplining or discharging student workers without “just cause.” It also establishes a process for the University to present grievances against student workers and ensures that union members will have access to union representation if Harvard disciplines them.
In the agreed upon strike provision, the union will not sanction strikes once the contract is ratified. In exchange, the University will not “lock out” union members from their workplace.
The union conceded to the University’s offer to put $25,000 annually toward an “emergency grant,” which would be distributed to student workers at the union’s discretion subject to Harvard’s approval. The union’s proposal had asked that the University contribute $100,000.
The two groups agreed that, when finalized, the contract will group student workers based on the nature of their work in order to determine their wages, though the union and University remain at odds over the amounts Harvard will ultimately pay each group.
Under one of the newly agreed-upon provisions, student workers living in University housing who decide to pay rent on a monthly basis, rather than up front, will not have to pay an additional fee. The two parties agreed to the provision as a “side letter,” meaning it will not be included in the permanent contract — a decision Harvard argued for in its initial proposals.
Swain wrote that the agreements reached during Wednesday’s meeting marked “progress” in the negotiations.
“The University remains committed to addressing concerns raised during these negotiations and will continue to meet with HGSU-UAW in hopes of reaching a reasonable resolution,” Swain wrote.
HGSU-UAW organizer Lee Kennedy-Shaffer, who facilitated Wednesday’s negotiations, wrote in an email to union members Thursday morning that the University’s bargaining team displayed a desire to reach an agreement during Wednesday’s negotiations.
“[T]he administration demonstrated more willingness to seriously bargain than they had up until this point,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote. “We also heard something we have not heard from the administration since bargaining began—that both parties at the table have a mutual interest in reaching an agreement.”
Swain added on Wednesday that the parties discussed each of the three topics central to the strike during the three-hour session but did not come to a consensus.
In response to the union’s proposed contract as of Dec. 2, the University put forth new proposals on Wednesday regarding two of the three issues: compensation and health care.
Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in his email to union members that he was disappointed by the new University proposals. He wrote that he believes they do not represent “substantive changes or a pathway to a contract on compensation, healthcare, and protections against harassment and discrimination.”
Harvard increased its proposed dollar amount for a pool fund to help finance union members’ child care from $275,000 to $325,000 annually. Still, the $50,000 increase falls short of the union’s proposal, which demands the University put $950,000 annually toward a fund that student workers can use to pay for costs related to supporting their children — not restricted to merely the cost of child care.
Administrators also proposed an annual pool fund of $100,000 to reimburse student workers for any medical costs that are not covered under the Student Health Plan.
The union’s Dec. 2 health care proposal calls on the University to help finance the costs of each member’s health care, rather than provide health care coverage through a pool fund. Under the union’s plan, Harvard would be required to reimburse student workers up to $500 due to annual costs related to mental health in addition to funding 90 percent of each student worker’s dental costs.
Harvard also increased its proposed compensation for student workers on Wednesday. The new proposals would give research assistants a 3 percent raise in the first year, followed by a 2.6 percent increase each subsequent year of the contract. For teaching fellows, the University’s new proposal would increase their pay by 2 percent in the first year followed by 2.6 percent each of the following two years. Harvard also offered to raise the minimum hourly rate for research work by one dollar to $16 per hour up from $15 per hour.
These raises do not match the union’s compensation proposal, which demands a 5 percent raise in the first year of the contract followed by 3.5 percent each of the following two years. The union’s proposal sets the minimum hourly wage at either $25 or a 5 percent increase from the current rate, whichever is greater.
Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in his email that the University’s new proposals would not end the strike.
“These minor improvements are not sufficient to settle this contract,” he wrote. “The strike continues as we head into winter break.”
The two parties have not scheduled their next bargaining meeting.
“We are hopeful that the administration will confirm further dates for an accelerated pace of bargaining prior to the start of the next semester,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in his email.
Roughly 100 union members and supporters gathered for a rally in Harvard Yard before escorting the union’s bargaining committee to their meeting with administrators, which took place at an administrative office building in Harvard Square.
History Ph.D. student Laura Correa Ochoa said in a speech at the rally that simply scheduling the bargaining session represented a victory for the union.
“I just want to start by saying that the bargaining meeting we landed today is not coming out of the generosity of Harvard’s heart,” she said. “This is a reflection of us being out here for three weeks and all the disruption we've caused, and I think we should be proud of that.”
“You won us this session,” HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Jennifer K. Austiff added in her speech.
Before the bargaining session, Music Ph.D. student Samantha C. Jones said in an interview that she was “hopeful, but not too hopeful” about the results of Wednesday’s negotiations.
“I'm very hopeful that [the union] can negotiate a contract and that the administration will come around to support us. Because it's in everyone's best interest for us to have a contract, including the administration's,” she said.
Since the strike began, participating union members have withheld all teaching and research responsibilities. For nearly three weeks, they have picketed from morning to evening, handing out flyers, singing strike-themed Christmas carols, and attempting to halt deliveries. The strike’s daily rallies have featured speeches from union organizers, faculty members, and politicians, including United States Representative Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern.
The union has not announced how the bargaining session will affect the strike. HGSU-UAW has previously said that the strike will not cease until the University and the union agree to a contract.
Though the fall semester concludes with the close of finals period on Thursday, union members have stated they are prepared to strike into the spring semester.
Human and Evolutionary Biology graduate student Evelyn J. Jagoda said in an interview that she expects union picketers to continue pressing the University until they reach a satisfactory agreement.
“If we don't get the contract we deserve and want today, we are not going to stop,” she said. “This will not be the end. We will be out here until we get what we deserve.”
Right before entering the bargaining session, Kennedy-Shaffer, told assembled union supporters that the bargaining committee would not waver.
“No matter what happens we're going to keep the pressure on the administration and we're not going anywhere because they think they can wait us out but they can't,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Executive Committee of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology will develop initiatives to increase public access to a set of historic photographs of enslaved people at the center of a lawsuit against Harvard, according to an email museum director Jane Pickering sent to the Committee.
Part of a set of images at issue in the suit, referred to as the “Zealy daguerreotypes,” picture two enslaved people identified as Renty and Delia. Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz commissioned them in 1850 as part of an attempt to prove his theory of biological white superiority.
Tamara K. Lanier — a Connecticut woman who says she is descended from Renty and Delia — sued the University and the Peabody Museum in March for possessing and profiting from the daguerreotypes. Lanier requests in the suit that the University turn the daguerreotypes over to her, give up all profits it has made off the photos, and pay punitive damages to her.
In her email to the faculty committee, Pickering wrote that the University would address the merits of Lanier’s case in future court filings, but added that the museum should learn from the lawsuit to improve its methods for responding to claims like Lanier’s.
“Ms. Lanier’s complaint raises important questions regarding, among other things, what it means for the Peabody to serve as an ethical steward of highly sensitive objects like the Zealy daguerreotypes,” Pickering wrote.
Pickering wrote that she hopes to work with the faculty committee to develop ways to make the daguerreotypes accessible to more of the public and “to tell the stories of the enslaved people that they depict.”
“I believe we can, and should, do more,” Pickering wrote. “The Peabody might, for instance, consider a long-term loan of the daguerreotypes to an institution with a collection that has a greater focus on African American history and culture.”
She also proposed that the museum organize a traveling exhibition with reproductions of the daguerreotypes.
In her lawsuit, Lanier alleged that the daguerreotypes amounted to “spoils of theft,” since the subjects were “stripped naked and forced to pose for the daguerreotypes without consent, dignity, or compensation.” She also alleged that the University has been using the images for financial profit, citing the use of the image of Renty on the cover of an anthropology book as an example.
In an April interview with The Crimson, University President Lawrence S. Bacow denied that the University only seeks to profit from the images, which are in the public domain. He also said that “the law is on our side” in the lawsuit.
Pickering wrote in her email to the faculty committee that Lanier and her daughter met with an archivist when they visited the daguerreotypes of Renty and Delia in 2010, and that museum staff asked Lanier to share any research she had conducted about the daguerreotypes and her relation to Renty and Delia.
“In sum, my understanding is that our staff treated Ms. Lanier with respect and repeatedly informed her that they were open to reviewing additional information about her story,” Pickering wrote.
Lanier could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Lanier’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay reiterated her position that the search for faculty who study race and ethnicity must come before the establishment of a formal Ethnic Studies concentration in an interview Friday, but said she is “hopeful” a concentration will be established “sooner rather than later.”
Gay first argued that hiring faculty must precede creating a concentration last fall, citing the need for faculty to lead the development of a program of study and ensure its long-term sustainability.
“It’s really about trying to build on our strength and get us to a point where we could not only, you know, stand up a really robust program, but ensure that there is longer term curricular stability,” Gay said Friday.
Earlier this month, Gay wrote an email to FAS affiliates about Harvard’s “institutional commitment” to building an ethnic studies program. The email came in the wake of renewed activism pushing for such a program, including a sit-in at University Hall and a protest during the faculty's monthly meeting in December.
While Harvard affiliates have lobbied for an ethnic studies program for nearly five decades, the University’s recent decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña — whose scholarship engages with race and ethnicity — prompted a surge in activism around the topic. Hundreds of students and ethnic studies scholars within and outside of Harvard have signed onto letters condemning the University’s decision.
Gay declined to comment on the tenure decision and on whether García Peña will continue serving on the faculty search committee.
García Peña did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Thursday morning.
As part of its commitment to strengthening ethnic studies, FAS is currently searching for four faculty members specializing in topics including ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration. Roughly a dozen candidates will visit campus in the spring and give public lectures, Gay said last week.
While the ethnic studies faculty search is open rank — meaning the faculty members may be hired at the tenured or tenure-track level — Gay said she recognizes the importance of selecting faculty equipped to be leaders. She predicted the “vast majority, if not all,” of the candidates that visit campus in the spring will be at the tenured ranks.
“I acknowledge and recognize that leadership will be important, and that argues for hires at the senior ranks,” she said.
Gay wrote in her to FAS affiliates that faculty, not deans, must “spearhead” the creation of a new ethnic studies concentration by developing a proposal and bringing it before the full faculty for a debate and ultimate vote.
Though she declined to name specific professors, Gay said last week that multiple current faculty members have expressed interest in helping to create the concentration to her and added that she will support them in doing so.
"Long before this message and actually since this message went out, there have been conversations with a number of individual faculty taking up the work — the necessary sort of faculty governance work — that would be required to establish a program," Gay said. "I'm feeling really optimistic, not only because we do, again, have important leaders who are already in our community who are prepared to take up this work, but then they will hopefully be joined by this next group of potential faculty leaders."
“I want to be a source of support and encouragement to the faculty who'd like to take up that work," she added.
Asked about the most significant things her office has worked on in the past year, Gay pointed to the ongoing faculty search.
“We’re not even at the point yet where we’re welcoming these folks into the community, but already it’s been great to see that we’re very clearly on a path that’s going to lead with a real enhancement of this area,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-five Harvard faculty joined more than 1,500 historians to sign an open letter Monday denouncing President Donald J. Trump’s “numerous and flagrant abuses of power” and calling for his impeachment.
On Wednesday evening, the United States House of Representatives voted, largely along party lines, to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress as a result of investigations into the president’s alleged corrupt solicitation of election assistance from the Ukranian government. Trump is the third president in the nation’s history to be impeached.
The historians’ letter condemns Trump’s actions towards Ukraine.
“It is our considered judgment that if President Trump’s misconduct does not rise to the level of impeachment, then virtually nothing does,” the letter reads.
The majority of Harvard signatories are professors in the History department. Several faculty members from the African and African American Studies department and the Kennedy School of Government also signed onto the letter.
The professors wrote that they believe Trump’s behavior represented the kind of conduct the founding fathers considered when they wrote laws on impeachment.
“Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses since the day he took office. He has defied the emoluments clause of the Constitution, defied congressional authority, and treated the Department of Justice as his personal defense team,” History professor James T. Kloppenberg wrote in an emailed statement. “His continuing pretense of being above the law is without precedent in US history.”
History and AAAS professor Vincent Brown made similar arguments, saying Trump’s behavior was what the Constitution’s framers feared in an executive.
“The evidence of his guilt in committing this offense is overwhelming and he continues to openly pursue the same goal, which compromises the integrity of our system of government,” Brown said.
The letter pointed to historical writings, including essays from Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, arguing that Trump’s actions fit Hamilton’s description of the purpose of impeachment.
“President Trump’s actions committed both before and during the House investigations fit Hamilton’s description and manifest utter and deliberate scorn for the rule of law and “repeated injuries” to constitutional democracy,” the letter read. ‘That disregard continues and it constitutes a clear and present danger to the Constitution.”
History professor Tiya A. Miles ’92 said history “can sometimes speak with potency to the present.”
“The past can sometimes speak with potency to the present. It seemed fitting to put the words of founding architects of the US government in front of our current political leaders at a moment of difficulty and truth,” Miles said.
Following Wednesday’s historic impeachment vote, the Republican-controlled Senate will hold a trial beginning early next year to determine whether or not the body will convict Trump and remove him from office.
Kennedy School professor Khalil G. Muhammad said that, in light of Wednesday’s vote, the impact of the historians’ letter is “already being felt.”
“I am encouraged that the record of what has happened today will reflect the expertise of historians who dedicated their lives to archives, primary evidence, and the nuances of the context in which ideas and laws were first crafted,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution Monday calling on Harvard to remove Arthur M. Sackler’s name from its museum.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern proposed the resolution, which was passed unanimously by the council during their last full meeting of 2019. The resolution, which “admonishes” the University and calls upon them to “strip the Sackler family name” from the museum, was further amended to include every councilor as a sponsor before its passage.
Several members of the Sackler family have served as executives at Purdue Pharma, the company that manufactures OxyContin, an addictive painkiller which has been linked to the opioid epidemic. Arthur Sackler died in 1987, nearly a decade before OxyContin began to be marketed, but many activists still place responsibility on him for developing marketing techniques that Purdue’s sales teams would later use to distribute the drug to pharmacies and doctors.
In an interview Tuesday, McGovern criticized the Sackler family for “profiting” off of OxyContin, which he called a “major contributor to the opioid crisis.” He added that he believes both the city and Harvard should play a role in addressing the crisis. According to the resolution, Middlesex County, Mass. had the highest number of deaths by opioid-related overdose in the state between 2014 and 2018, including 124 deaths in Cambridge.
“I have been doing a lot of work on the opioid crisis, both in Cambridge and serving on the state harm reduction commission,” McGovern said. “We felt that Cambridge needed to be part of that movement as well and Harvard should be a part of that.”
Janet Wootten, a spokesperson for Jillian Sackler — the widow of Arthur Sackler — disputed several of the councilors’ remarks, writing in an emailed statement that any claims about Arthur Sackler having involvement in OxyContin are false.
“Arthur pioneered newsletters to physicians and direct mail marketing back in the 1950s and 1960s,” she wrote. “To say that he pioneered the methods that his brothers and their descendants used to market OxyContin is like saying that the man who invented the wheel is responsible for a massive car crash on a superhighway.”
Wootten added that criticism of the “Sackler family” as a whole is a “convenient myth,” and that Arthur Sackler’s descendants are not involved with or profit from OxyContin sales.
“The family is not a monolith,” she wrote.
During the meeting, Vice Mayor Jan Devereux said that “regardless” of whether Arthur Sackler was involved, there remains “immediate reason” to “condemn” the fact the museum bears his name.
“A Sackler name is not welcome on a building,” she said.
Earlier this month, Tufts University announced it would remove the Sackler name from five facilities and programs on its campus. Though several international cultural institutions, such as the Guggenheim Museum and the Louvre, had previously announced that they would either strip the Sackler name from their walls or refuse future Sackler family donations, Tufts became the first university to take similar action.
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on the council’s actions.
In an email sent to members of the council and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, Thomas J. Lucey, who serves as Harvard’s community relations director for Cambridge, wrote that Arthur Sackler donated to the construction of the original building that held the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. He also reiterated that Sackler died before OxyContin was developed.
“The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation does not fund the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard,” he wrote.
In an emailed statement provided by Wootten, Jillian Sackler wrote that her husband “had nothing to do” with and “did not profit” from the manufacturing or marketing of OxyContin. She added that none of her husband’s work went to “opioids or to deceptive medical marketing.”
“It deeply saddens me to witness Arthur being blamed for actions taken by his brothers and other OxySacklers,” she wrote.
Monday's council meeting — the final of 2019 and the current council term — also marked the end of the line for Devereux and Councilor Craig A. Kelley. Devereux opted not to run for another term, and Kelley was defeated in November's council election. The pair will be replaced by incoming councilors Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80.
In their closing remarks, Devereux and Kelley thanked councilors and city staff.
"Each of you has been incredibly diligent, you've brought a lot of passion and intelligence and humor to the job,” Devereux said.
Kelley added that after 14 years on the council, he would remain invested and active in city matters.
“Vice Mayor Devereux, I don't know what the hell we'll do, but we'll do something fun after this,” he said.
