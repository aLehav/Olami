Weeks away from graduating, Alex J. Iascone ’16 is bringing his one-man show, “My Harvard Experience with Chastity,” to the Adams Pool Theater. The production, written and directed by Iascone himself, is sponsored by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. He aims to entertain audience members with a comic retelling of the amusing antics of his college love life.
The show’s title notwithstanding, explicit topics will abound in Iascone’s monologues. “I’ve not personally taken a vow of chastity, but the whole show sort of revolves around this concept of having sex and not having sex and all these interactions that lead up to it, and sort of commenting on the whole dating and hooking up [experience] at Harvard,” Iascone says.
In just over an hour, Iascone plans to detail some of the best—and worst—moments of his amorous pursuits. And he isn’t deterred by the especially intimate nature of the show’s content. “I think [the stage] a really good place for comedy because it’s a place where you can really be vulnerable,” he says. “When you’re up there and telling something that’s personal to you and happened to you, the audience is automatically engaged in this human experience.”
According to Iascone, the main aim of the production is to do justice to some of the romantic situations played out on stage, presenting a fuller picture than typical representations of the same types of interactions. To achieve this, he will attempt to imagine experiences from all sides of scenarios. One area in particular that he plans to investigate is the issue of “real and fake” in hookup culture. “I really don’t like playing games and not saying what you mean,” he says. “You know the whole text thing like if you like a guy, and he texts you, you don’t want to text him right back, right, you’ve got to wait a couple hours? I hate that—that’s the worst thing in the world to me.”
Despite his efforts to give all perspectives a fair share in his telling, Iascone does not promise to flatter any audience members. “It’s going to offend a lot of people,” he says. “If you’re a final clubs bro, you’re going to be offended by a lot of the stuff I say. If you’re a feminist, you’re going to be offended by a lot of the stuff I say. No side or person is safe in this show.”
“My Harvard Experience with Chastity” will run April 22 and 23 in the Adams Pool Theater.

Given that “Are You Serious” is Andrew Bird’s 13th studio album (among dozens of other projects and EPs), one might think that Bird's looping violin arpeggios and rolling rhythms would have become tiresome by now. In his newest release, however, Bird brings to light new thoughts on his personal life. He's married now, and he’s back with a new intimacy in his lyrics that seems to zero in on his life as opposed to chasing high-flying philosophies.
The question in the album’s title seems applicable to Bird himself as an artist. Trained in violin performance, he started out in a jazz/blues/folk-inspired band before embarking on his career as a solo artist. His songs often have a whimsical lilt to them, but there is nevertheless a serious side to his lyrics—take, for example, the ontological questioning in “Lazy Projector” (“If memory serves us, then who owns the master”) or the nastily dark humor of “Heretics” (“Tell us what we did wrong and you can blame us for it / Turn a clamp on our thumbs, we'll sew a doll about it”). “Are You Serious” embraces that same mish-mash of light and dark, but with new perspectives and themes like finding solace and truth. The result is 11 piquant tracks that are a joy to listen to while remaining thought-provoking with respect to subject matter.
The main subject of many of these songs is the space between two people—a theme that’s been explored previously in Bird’s works, but perhaps never quite so well. Though romantic ballads are easy to come by, Bird uses his melodies to convey the drama inherent in any relationship. In the most curiously structured song on the album, "Left-Handed Kisses,” lines from Bird and guest artist Fiona Apple echo back and forth, each artist steadfastly clinging to his or her own convictions. The setup is made overtly clear in the accompanying music video: Bird's character, who prides himself on refraining from such overblown overtures, finds himself writing a love song. His reluctance is made clear both in the lyrics and in the questioning melody of his violin. Apple’s character, meanwhile, righteously defends her own romantic notions but still feels a need to explain herself to her supposedly cynical lover. Neither side of this argument seems to be the correct one; it feels as if the main thrust is trying to find a balance between two modes of thought before the receiver clicks at the end of the song. The nearly literal quality of the music itself, which reflects this tug-of-war with starts, stops, and slides, is what makes Bird such a wonderful performer and musician.
In spite of new twists such as this duet structure, Bird pulls on his strong tradition of improvisation with the easy, flowing sounds of songs like “Roma Fade” and “Puma,” reminiscent of past albums like “Break It Yourself” and “Noble Beast.” He still relies on his looping pedal to layer melodies on top of one another, but these melodies are newer and fresher than those on his older albums. The distortions Bird applies to his violin amplify his alternative rock tendencies, making the instrument seem more like a solo guitar than a member of an orchestra. “Puma” also features Bird's customary rhyming, which often can pile up on top of itself as if Bird is merely a child listing words that sound the same. As a lyricist, he is known for his intricate combinations of words both common and bizarre, but this record delivers more concrete lyrics.
This shift becomes clear in the second half of the record, where the last four songs tie together in a narrative. First, the main melody of "Saints Preservus" echoes a contemporary arrangement of the biblical Psalm 23, which speaks of the religious theme of shepherding and letting go of one's fears. And even as Bird, in the following "The New Saint Jude," pulls on the history of the patron saint of lost causes, his lyrics hint at a much more personal struggle somehow liberating in its darkness: "Ever since I gave up on hope, I've been feeling so much better."
That sense of freedom has always been present in Bird’s work, but it manifests in a different manner here. On other albums, Bird’s lyrics tended to be cerebral and surreal, referencing aubergine dreams and Scythian empires. In contrast, this record contains many more simple moments, as in lines such as the album’s concluding sentence: “I think I’ve found someone.” Lyrical accessibility adds a bit more humanity to Bird’s music, though it rarely lacked any in the first place. In fact, this album doesn’t explicitly do anything that Bird’s discography hasn’t already explored. It’s simply another extension of what he does best: expressing human emotion through the strings of his violin.

A 10-second slice from any of the tracks on “Beautiful Lies” will quickly point to a very clear conclusion: Birdy has grown to become nearly unrecognizable. Her newest album does weave in traces of influence from her early sound, but its clear focus is on Birdy’s breaking through the sphere of indie-folk ballads and experimenting with elements from the foreign realm of indie-pop. The result is a huge creative leap forward and the finest display of her talents to date. Through “Beautiful Lies,” Birdy affirms that the days of her sweet yet safe cover of Bon Iver’s “Skinny Love” are long gone and that what lies ahead in her career is a more gorgeously complex and daringly individual sound.
Back in 2011, the then-14-year-old Birdy’s first offerings were charming enough. Her covers, accompanied by piano, easily lent themselves to monotony but were gracefully buoyed by the spellbinding innocence of her high-pitched, quivering voice. In “Beautiful Lies”, her vocal color has changed to a shocking degree: Birdy has traded her sweet, childlike warble for a drastically deeper, richer tone. “Keeping Your Head Up” is a track that epitomizes her transformation. Its mesh of thundering bass, electronica, and synth would have swallowed the old Birdy whole, but the fullness of her voice now proves more than capable of powering through the track’s heavy production. Whereas the climax in 2011’s “Skinny Love” featured a wavering vocal tremble that was earnest but strained and uneven, the bridge in “Keeping Your Head Up” presents Birdy in complete command of a haunting, pristinely smooth vibrato. The transition to this new musical style appears to pose no problem for her; she sounds as though she is perfectly in her element.
More than a stunning display of stylistic expansion, “Beautiful Lies” is a remarkable album thematically. The span of Birdy’s career has seen her development from sampling the styles of other musicians in her early covers as a wide-eyed adolescent to penning her own lyrics as a confident young woman. So it would have been easy to make the album a bombastic display of victory and strength, but that isn’t the case at all. Though the album as a whole still certainly showcases Birdy’s burgeoning creativity and confidence, there is also a very careful harmony between the bold (“You know that I’m not done yet / there’s still a fight in me left” from “Silhouette”) and the disquieting (“You’re in the clear/while I'm waking up to nothing but tears” from “Words”). The balance contextualizes each track to make sense of the album’s overarching theme: daring to power through some of life’s inevitably darker moments.
“Beautiful Lies” is generally thoughtful, with lines such as “Love shouldn’t cost a thing/ Tell me why I’m paying for everything” and “ Save yourself my darling/ Just be gone by morning”—both from “Save Yourself.” However, the lyrics are not without their flaws. In certain individual tracks, there is an irksome incompatibility between the message and the atmosphere created by the music. For instance, “Hear You Calling” features infectious synth beats and almost aggressively cheerful major chords; lyrically, however, the track is meant to be an aching meditation on the loss of a loved one. This kind of disconnect unfortunately happens often and proves to be the album’s major weakness. Nonetheless, such a stumble does not drastically undermine Birdy’s achievement in creating “Beautiful Lies,” and the poignancy of some of her early original phrases in her new album suggests nothing but an upward trajectory for her lyricism.

While they likely won’t be headlining annual arts and culture festival Burning Man anytime soon, indie group free cake for every creature infuse the new 10-track gem “talking quietly of anything with you” with a soft immediacy, building on the last of the festival’s ten central principles. Eschewing the broad declarations about the nature of fate and humanity that run eye-rollingly rampant in the lyrics of some other groups in their genre, free cake for every creature stick to imagery that is beautiful in its simplicity and remain in the realm of relatable reality. They speak not of grand boulevards but of the narrow streets of a new city. Their love affairs may not be star-crossed, but the intimacy of scenes like a bowl of soup shared over meditations on youth and change is concretely touching. Whether this earnestness is inspired by personal experience or comes from living vicariously through the motley crew of characters on a show such as “Girls”––on the soundtrack of which these tunes would be at home––the album is as unassuming as it is delightful. The band recorded the album itself in upstate New York, but their previous move to Philadelphia clearly allows them to relate to fellow recent city immigrants struggling to navigate everything from foreign social scenes to befuddling public transit systems.
That the album debuted on youthful label Double Double Whammy Records, known for East Coast lo-fi and edgy-folk bands like the raw-but-lovely Eskimeaux, lends an extra air of do-it-yourself magic to a work that could easily have strayed too far toward pop and alienated a fan base of hipsters who prefer melody to math rock. Listeners who once begged their parents to pay $9.99 to download the “Juno” soundtrack on their first iPod mini will find the album’s lyrics––all of which seem like they should be inscribed sans punctuation––particularly appealing. Reassurances like “all you gotta be when you're 23 is yourself” alternate with evidence of requisite quarter-life crises. In the canon of songs about being 23, free cake for every creature’s musings on turning “a decade plus a baker's dozen” reject Blink-182’s 1999 negativity; Instead, they provide validation for other 20-somethings who “weep for no reason” with their friends and owe no one an apology for wearing “stupid lookin’ shoes” while they “defuse leftover teenage blues.” Recent graduates disinterested with the trappings of the conventional young-professional life of their peers in consulting and finance are reassured that it’s fine to “call yourself an artist! work part-time at whole foods! it's all good.”
Though the album might be not particularly groundbreaking and its sound a bit too precious, it is cohesive and pleasant. The poignant and often poetic character of its lyrics deserve a closer listen from any who are initially turned off their inherent eccentricity. Its melodies rely on a single vocalist’s talent, and its themes focus on the joys of companionship––both platonic and amorous––in periods of exploration and uncertainty. Vignettes of humanity that are simultaneously personal and universal include perfectly captured images like wanderlust-filled adventurers who read books about Malaysia and “get wild on green tea.” The quirkiness evident in the band’s stated preference for putting cheese fries on their pizza and writing poems on the walls of department store dressing rooms is not self-conscious, however. Careful self-reflections have clearly led to encouraging conclusions like the opening track’s assertion: “it took me years to believe! i could be quiet and still uncompromising.”
Blame it on a diet-of-cheap-ramen-induced hunger or the fact that their namesake is a baked good, but free cake for every creature use the creation and consumption of different foods as extended metaphors to effectively capture emotions and experiences. It is a rare band indeed that can inject individuality and meaning into an action as mundane as making muffins despite forgoing a recipe and eating them for dinner even though they look “scary.” To them, “love’s an onion ring––burn my tongue but it tastes sweet! come closer and we'll share this piece”––an unusual but tempting offer.
“talking quietly of anything with you” is a delightful addition to the canon of contemporary softly sunny indie music. The album avoids the oft-used derogatory descriptor “twee” by remaining uplifting but not cloying and embracing a love of bad jokes. Keeping all 10 songs under three minutes to avoid monotony and maintain intrigue, free cake for every creature are fresh and undeniably distinct. The statement “i'm still movin’! i'm not where i wanna be! but i'm open to possibilities” on closing song “still movin’” leaves room for them to continue exploring as they mature––while still saying “cheers” over cans of beans and drawing chubby cows in their journals.

Curtis Sittenfeld’s recent reworking of Jane Austen’s most famous work, “Eligible,” does not begin with the quintessential line, “It is a truth universally acknowledged,” but the question of marriage—or the lack thereof— does immediately become a topic of interest for its characters. As a modern-day take on “Pride and Prejudice,” Sittenfield’s book keeps close to its inspiration’s main points of conflict; issues of class, vanity, and love run rampant within its pages. But to weigh the thematic value of “Eligible” against that of the classic novel would be to do Sittenfeld’s work a disservice. “Eligible” does not promise to be another “Pride and Prejudice.” While its plot might be similar (albeit with much-needed contemporary twists) and its characters might possess the same names, it does not try to evoke poetic phrases or present mind-shattering commentary on the world. Instead, Sittenfeld has successfully crafted a fun, engaging romp whose greatest mission is to excite any Jane Austen fan.
“Eligible” is both familiar and not: Liz Bennet, a 30-something magazine writer, and her older sister, Jane, have not had the best of luck in love. Liz is currently in an affair-but-not with her crush of over a decade. Jane, approaching 40, is still without a husband or child, having turned to a sperm bank to fix the latter problem. When their father has a heart attack, the two sisters return from New York City to Cincinnati to care for him and find their stately home and not-so-stately family in incredible chaos. But Liz’s attempts to take control of the situation spiral out of control when the family meets Chip Bingley, a doctor and past contestant on the reality TV show “Eligible” (the book’s version of “The Bachelor”), and his brooding neurosurgeon friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy.
The updated plot allows Sittenfeld to surprise the reader by playing off well-known elements within the story of the original and adding new twists. Jane’s use of artificial insemination changes the nature of the initial fallout between Bingley and Jane, while Bingley’s past participation in “Eligible” becomes a crucial part of their eventual reunion. Wickham—the soldier who captures Elizabeth’s fancy and elopes with Lydia in Austen’s original story—becomes two different characters with surprising backstories, incredibly different from the handling of the character in “Pride and Prejudice” but well-updated for the new setting and time period. Such changes let Sittenfeld to honor the original while keeping the reader hooked and chortling at any unexpected development. Furthermore, Sittenfeld shows incredible awareness of her source material and uses the reader’s familiarity with the story to her advantage—often to comic effect. In “Pride and Prejudice,” Darcy insults Elizabeth’s family and then declares his love for her, saying “You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” But in “Eligible,” when Darcy shows up at Liz’s door to confess his affection for her early in the morning (“I was in my pajamas and didn’t even have a bra on,” Liz tells Jane in a comment that further highlights the awkwardness of the situation), his proclamation is just as memorably haughty, though now he insinuates that his love for her is “probably an illusion caused by the release of oxytocin during sex.” This interplay between science and romance, situated in a version of a classic novel, not only emphasizes the modernity of Sittenfeld’s tale but also adds a touch of newfound humor to the situation.
Besides revamping the story, the novel reinterprets the classic characters of “Pride and Prejudice” while simultaneously granting them a sleeker, more modern dimension. In particular, Sittenfeld endows the entire Bennet family with a certain vivacity; Mr. Bennet, for instance, is still his unforgettable wry self, but now his humor is more casual and packs a harsher punch. “A reality show isn’t unlike the Nobel Peace Prize, then…. in that they both require nominations,” he notes early on in the novel. The care with which Sittenfeld portrays the Bennet family, perhaps even greater than the care with which she portrays Liz’s romantic interest in Darcy, suggests her greater fascination with family dynamics than with romance—
and while the novel contains enough sexually intense interactions between Darcy and Liz to satisfy any Austen diehard, the duo’s interactions fill a relatively small portion of the novel’s 500 pages. Sittenfeld still considers marriage, but a family’s change becomes much more important. This decision is a successful one: Not only does it differentiate the story from its predecessor, but it also feels more suitable for the world in which the characters now exist. As a modern woman, Liz will not let a suitable marriage define the rest of her life—she already has a stable income from her work—so it is reasonable that her daily worries consist more of tending to her family and balancing her work.
To emphasize the new setting further, contemporary issues receive some attention. Mrs. Bennet is racist and anti-Semitic, and both she and her husband are unaware of what it means to be transgender. The Affordable Care Act receives several mentions throughout the story, especially when the characters discover that the Bennet parents do not have health insurance. Yet while the novel touches upon these weighty political issues, it does not philosophize; in fact, the mentions are brief sentences and phrases in a much longer dialogue or narration. Sittenfeld is not interested in making a social argument—rather, she alludes to these topics to show how the characters are now operating within more modern contexts.
The melding of gravity and flair with a rejection of all intellectual pretense also appears in Sittenfeld’s writing style. Sittenfeld does not string together poignant phrases into paragraphs, instead employing a breezy language that makes the novel quick and easy to absorb. Yet she often engages in witty wordplay: “[Love is] a condition that’s acute, not chronic,” Mr. Bennet says. The effect is an awareness of the thematic and stylistic value of the original novel, but one that does not strive to clone this appeal, instead opting for more comedic means.
Ultimately, “Eligible” is a light-hearted and hilarious read for lovers of Austen’s works or for those in search of a clever romantic comedy. The novel is not the most revolutionary book on the market, but then again, enlightenment does not seem to be Sittenfeld’s goal. Instead, she seeks to pay homage to a famous work of literature by giving it a fresh and entertaining makeover. There exist many truths in this world, but for Sittenfeld in her latest book, the greatest truth is the universality—one transcending centuries and countries—to be found in Austen’s beloved tale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few people deserve to be the face of American currency more than Harriet Tubman. She is a fierce and universally recognized symbol for liberty, whose contributions to protecting our nation’s fundamental principles are paralleled only by her contributions to our nation’s understated history of black, female badassery. She is our nation’s most celebrated female war hero, as well as a personal hero of mine.
In one of my favorite incidents in American history, Tubman decided to undergo open-skull brain surgery to alleviate a childhood injury when she was in her 70s—she refused anesthesia, instead deciding to bite down on a bullet, like she saw Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were being amputated.
This is all to say, our nation will gain a lot from having Tubman grace the 20 dollar bill, replacing President Andrew Jackson. There’s similarly a lot to be gained in honoring the slew of other figures who will be featured on new bills: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Lucretia Mott, and Alice Paul on the back of the $10; Martin Luther King Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, and Marian Anderson on the back of the $5.
But this is little consolation for the deprivation of liberty that these figures and the demographics they represent have suffered in America, and it is ultimately emblematic of a  nontrivial, even arrogant endeavor to sanitize history on a large and visible scale.
I’ve written on this subject before, specifically in response to the Harvard administration’s decision to rename the title of House Master. Alumnus David Lowenthal '44 aired similar concerns with the title change and related gutting of the Harvard Law School seal in a Crimson op-ed just this week.
At first glance, the issue of rebranding currency seems altogether different from the recent streak of historical purging at Harvard—unlike a title, a seal, or a building, money does not have obvious historical value, bearing more significance as a commodity than an artifact. And to the extent that money does have an accessible history, Tubman is as relevant to it as Jackson. With the exception of Alexander Hamilton, the father of the modern financial system and face of the 10 dollar bill, the current figures gracing our currency have little logical connection to the history of money beyond their service to our nation in general.
But the underlying reasoning behind this momentous overhaul of the design of American currency is all too familiar: Whatever little or arbitrary history that money represents is not palatable to the people, and so the people are revising it. Andrew Jackson was a vile slave-owning bureaucrat, who the people overwhelmingly—as measured by polling by the popular Women on 20s campaign—want to trade in for Tubman. "The decision to put Harriet Tubman on the new $20 was driven by thousands of responses we received from Americans young and old,” said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
Yet despite their specious allure, both this idea that our memory of the past should be cleansed of its harrowing realities and this method of crowdsourcing claims to historicity, are problematic. First of all, history is a reflection of timeless truths, not current values. Downplaying the record based on interpretations of today’s zeitgeist undermines this function of history as a comprehensive and ageless spectator.
Moreover, history has important pedagogical value. There is power in viewing Jackson as a symbol of slavery and ethnic cleansing. It inspires us to critically examine even the most celebrated figures in history, forever remember the failures of the past, and most crucially, approach present injustices with the fervor and resolve of the millions wronged by history’s most disturbing cruelties. Putting Tubman’s face on a dollar, for example, will do little to combat the fact that for every one a man earns, a black woman only earns 64 cents.
It takes courage to stand athwart history’s frustrating tendency towards self-correction—a fraction of the courage of Harriet Tubman and the others who will soon adorn our dollars, but courage nonetheless. But I hope I’ll find this courage in those who, like I, oppose these changes on our currency, who can separate their feelings about a remarkable woman from this distressing decision and find value in history’s bleakest moments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“If we can better understand how oppression and exploitation could seem commonplace to so many of those who built Harvard, we may better equip ourselves to combat our own shortcomings and to advance justice and equality in our own time.” — President Drew Faust
Last month, President Faust authored a piece in this newspaper acknowledging Harvard’s ties to historical slavery. President Faust’s call to interrogate Harvard’s complicit role in exploitations of the past signals great progress in the direction of social justice. Our nation still struggles with the centuries-long reverberations of our history with slavery—in our institutions, our social structures, and our economy.
And slavery is still among us.
Think about a few of the items you bought this past year. A chocolate bar. A couple new shirts. The latest iPhone. Do you know where those products came from? Do you know how many of them were made by people who were coerced, abducted, or tricked into performing labor without their consent? More than 21 million people are victims of forced labor and other forms of modern slavery worldwide. They make our clothes, shoes, phones, and other commodities. Slaves living in the United States pick the fruits and vegetables we eat. Even in 2016, we all participate in a global economy that runs on slaves.
If we don’t take action now to sustainably address modern-day slavery, future generations will look back and wonder how we tolerated such atrocities for so long, leaving the world to suffer the consequences.
In an ideal world, consumers would be armed with data and options, and could choose to support companies that ensure strong labor standards. The reality is that many of us do not have the time and energy to devote to investigating the origins of every purchase we make. However, we can build a partnership—across all Harvard schools, student groups, faculty members, functional departments, and alumni networks—to leverage the University’s purchasing power to make a real impact on the lives of workers.
According to the Office of Strategic Procurement, the University procures more than $3.4 billion in goods and services each year; despite the high risk that modern slavery exists in at least some places along the many tiers of the procurement supply chain, there are currently no mechanisms in place to hold accountable Harvard’s thousands of supplier companies. Other universities are already looking at this issue: For example, at the University of Michigan, the President’s Advisory Committee on Labor Standards and Human Rights has been in place since 2000 and monitors the labor practices of companies selling goods licensed by the university. Originally formed to look at licensed goods, the Committee has begun to explore the labor practices used to produce other goods procured by the University. Similarly, Harvard belongs to the Fair Labor Association, meaning licensed goods produced for the University must meet certain labor standards in production. However, right now too much is still unknown about human rights standards in the University’s broader procurement supply chains beyond licensed goods.
The first step to progress is a holistic understanding of Harvard’s supply chains. Next week, a core team of students from the College, the Kennedy School, the Law School, the Business School, and the School of Public Health are opening a dialogue with the administration to strive for greater transparency about the University’s purchasing and procurement methods. With a deeper understanding of the supply chains, we can then determine if policy changes are needed to ensure that no future exploitative labor practices exist in Harvard’s procurement.
But transparency is only possible if there is commitment from students and staff alike.
We know that Harvard students care about human rights and labor injustices; past generations of students have worked tirelessly for change. In March 2000, after pressuring the administration for over a year to provide Harvard workers a living wage of $10.25 per hour, Harvard’s Progressive Student Labor Movement gained national attention when they occupied Massachusetts Hall for 21 days. Eventually, their efforts persuaded the University to increase workers’ wages. In November 2000, Harvard Students Against Sweatshops successfully urged then-President Larry Summers to join the Workers’ Rights Consortium as a measure to ensure Harvard-labeled apparel would not be made in sweatshops. This year, student activists successfully advocated for the elimination of the title “House master” and the removal of the Royall family crest from the Harvard Law School shield.
But we still have a long way to go. Our complacency in not knowing the extent of the exploitation tainting our supply chains is no longer acceptable. If our campus community truly believes that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, we cannot possibly stand for exploitation of any form against a fellow human. Even though we may not be in close proximity to human rights violations within our supply chains, members of the Harvard community are best positioned to act on behalf of those who are powerless and dehumanized, given the University’s position in the spotlight as a major academic institution and driver of social change. We hope we can count on your support of our coalition of students to engage the administration to identify new solutions for greater transparency. Let's ensure our tuition dollars are never funding slavery. Not in 1737, and not today.
We need your support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the student activist organization Reclaim Harvard Law published an open letter calling for the end of tuition at Harvard Law School. The demand, dubbed “Fees Must Fall,” is a second act to the Reclaim movement’s successful “Royall Must Fall” campaign to change the Law School’s seal. The campaign brings to mind the Board of Overseers campaign of Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron K. Unz '83, who is running on a controversial platform of free tuition for all undergraduates.
Since education costs have risen far faster than inflation for decades, free tuition financed by the world’s largest university endowment may seem like an unmitigated good at both the College and the Law School. Reclaim’s demands, however, are unfeasible for many of the same reasons that Unz’s are. If Harvard wants its law school to remain one of the best in the country, it will need to plan to fund it comparably to its competitors. The goal of free tuition is difficult to achieve as much of Harvard’s endowment is already earmarked for other purposes. In fact, the University already spends far more educating each student than it takes in through tuition.
The Law School in particular is obscenely expensive. The median graduate from the class of 2015 left Cambridge with nearly $150,000 in debt. But this figure obscures the vast gulf that separates the Law School graduates who choose to pursue high- and low-earning careers after graduation. Rather than subsidizing all students indiscriminately, the Law School should increase funding to existing programs like the Low Income Protection Plan, which provides loan repayment assistance to students who devote their careers to public service and pro bono work.
Many graduates pursue paths within the legal field that render the student loans less significant of a challenge. The starting salary at the most competitive big city law firms can exceed $160,000 in the first year after graduation, and the average graduate earns over $116,000 out of school. In contrast, salaries for government employees and public defenders can be as low as $30,000. For graduates planning on pursuing pro bono work in the long term, student debt can quickly become an overwhelming burden.
The goal should be a payment structure that gives all students—particularly women and people of underrepresented minority groups—the financial freedom to choose the career path they want. Slashing tuition indiscriminately across the board subsidizes the most privileged and diverts resources from those who most need the financial support and seek to serve the public good for lower compensation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust traveled to Washington D.C. this week to advocate for maintaining the tax-exempt status of Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment and increasing federal research funding.
Recently, Harvard’s endowment has come under scrutiny from members of Congress who suggest large university endowments should be taxed. Earlier this year, some members of Congress requested that all schools with endowments larger than $1 billion answer a series of questions about how they use the money from their endowments. Faust responded with a public letter justifying the endowment’s tax-exempt status and explaining how it funds a number of University programs, including financial aid.
In an interview before her trip, Faust said that she would be “trying to explain how endowments work and why they’re important and why they’re a good thing, not a bad thing” to the House Ways and Means Committee members who raised questions about endowments.
Faust also met with several legislators, including U.S. Senators Susan M. Collins, Orrin G. Hatch, John F. Reed, and Benjamin E. Sasse ’94, according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal. U.S. Representative John Lewis, who was on campus earlier this month with Faust to unveil a plaque dedicated to four slaves who lived and worked at Harvard in the 18th century, and Massachusetts representative Richard Neal were also among the public officials Faust met.
In those meetings, Faust focused on federal funding for scientific research at colleges and universities. Harvard receives hundreds of millions of dollars every year to for scientific research funding, but in recent years, among federal budget cuts, federal support has declined. In 2015, Harvard received less than $800 million from outside funding sources, including the federal government—the lowest amount it has received since 2010.
Faust said she regularly argues for increased federal research funding from the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health, among other sources, when she meets with legislators.
“A constant is science funding and making the case for the kinds of discovery and insight that come out of our science faculty,” Faust said earlier this month.
On her trip, Faust also met with other university presidents at the Association of American Universities, a higher education nonprofit that counts more than 60 colleges and universities as members, according to Neal.
“The presidents all come together for two and a half days of meetings in Washington on a variety of subjects,” Faust said. “The program varies from year to year, and I usually spend some time visiting people on the Hill and in the government to make the case for universities and make connections around issues that relate to our public perceptions and legislative issues."
In 2015, Harvard spent $540,000 lobbying Congress and the federal government, according to public records filed with Congress.

With shovels and hardhats, members of Harvard Business School gathered at a small ceremony to break ground on what will eventually be Klarman Hall, a new “convening center” for students and faculty.
The project is funded by a gift from Seth and Beth Klarman as part of the ongoing University-wide $6.5 billion capital campaign, which recently met its overall goal. As of March, the Business School has raised $925 million of its $1 billion goal.
The hall is expected to open in 2018. Combining elements of a large-scale conference center, a performance space, and a smaller forum, the space has been dubbed as “a true One Harvard facility.”
Seth Klarman spoke about his inspiration for the gift, saying that the Business School has a powerful role in contributing to public dialogue about effective business management and practices.
“When you bring people with talent, vision, and ambition together in a space designed specifically to facilitate connections… the potential for transformative ideas and action is limitless,” Klarman said in a public statement.
He highlighted the building’s importance as a space in which the energy and innovation of all the students, faculty, and researchers can come together.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria spoke briefly before donning his hardhat, responding to Klarman’s call for the school to never forget its global influence.
“I promise we will live up to the hope that this is an institution that will continue to educate leaders of the world,” he said.
Alongside Seth Klarman and Nohria were University President Drew G. Faust and Beth Klarman. The four stood side by side to make the ceremonial first dig in the spot where the hall will eventually exist.
Klarman Hall will include a 1,000 seat auditorium, which is enough to accommodate an entire MBA class. Currently, whole MBA classes can be accommodated in the auditorium of Burden Hall—the building the new one will replace—but not without setting up additional folding chairs, according to Business School spokesperson James E. Aisner.
The new hall will also include a multipurpose foyer, a pre-function reception space, stage and backstage space, and LEED Gold sustainability certification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Law School student asked a question perceived to be anti-Semitic to former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni during an event last week, provoking outrage at the school and in Israel.
The event, titled “The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict and the U.S.,” was a discussion between Livni and U.S. diplomat Dennis Ross co-sponsored by the Jewish Law Students Association and Harvard Hillel. During the question-and-answer session following the event, an unidentified student asked Livni, “How is it that you are so smelly?... A question about the odor of Ms. Tzipi Livni, she’s very smelly, and I was just wondering.”
The remark drew quick condemnation. Law School Dean Martha L. Minow sent an email to school affiliates on Tuesday denouncing the comment as inappropriate. “The comment was offensive and it violated the trust and respect we expect in our community. Many perceive it as anti-Semitic, and no one would see it as appropriate,” she wrote. “It was an embarrassment to this institution and an assault upon the values we seek to uphold.”
Jewish Law Association president Jonathan R. Gartner and incoming co-presidents Jeremy H. Salinger and Jacqueline A. Wolpoe decried the comment as anti-Semitic in an article in the Harvard Law Record. They wrote that the word “smelly” conjured the demeaning stereotype of the “smelly Jew,” and asked the student who made the comment to apologize.
“When this student suggested that Tzipi Livni was a ‘smelly Jew,’ he not only vilified her, but he vilified every Jewish student, faculty, and staff member at Harvard Law School. This anti-Semitic rhetoric is not acceptable,” they wrote. “It is hate speech.”
By Wednesday, the remark had sparked controversy on the other side of the world, as several Israeli newspapers began covering the story. The Jerusalem Post published a story about the incident, and Hamodia—described as the “Daily Newspaper of Torah Jewry”—wrote that Livni had been “subjected to verbal abuse” at the Law School.
The backlash prompted the student who made the remark to publish an anonymous apology in The Record, denying that he intended his comments to be anti-Semitic and expressing regret for any harm he might have caused.
“I am writing to apologize, as sincerely as I can via this limited form of communication, to anyone who may have felt offended by the comments I made last week,” the student wrote. “I can see now… how my words could have been interpreted as a reference to an anti-Semitic stereotype, one that I was entirely unaware of prior to the publication of this article.”
The apology and the Jewish Law Association article did not name the student, and the Law Record removed comments identifying the student from their website. Law School spokesperson Michelle B. Deakin said federal privacy laws prevent the school from revealing the name of the student in question and whether that student will face disciplinary action.
The school released a full video of the event on Wednesday with the offending comment edited out, according to The Record. A student condemned this action in The Record, writing that “Harvard Law is sending a message that censorship may be appropriate if comments are embarrassing or offensive.”
The incident comes amid debate about the right to free speech at the school—an issue Minow addressed in her message to HLS affiliates. “The fact that speech is and should be free does not mean that hateful remarks should go unacknowledged or unanswered in a community dedicated to thoughtful discussion of complex issues and questions,” she wrote.

Following national trends in mental health across college campuses, rates of anxiety among both incoming and current students at Harvard are on the rise, according to reports from Harvard University Health Services.
Every fall, incoming freshmen complete a health survey from HUHS. The mental health portion of the survey shows that while rates of depression among incoming freshmen have fluctuated over the past eight years, rates of anxiety have seen a marked increased in recent years, according to HUHS director Paul J. Barreira.
“And this is also nationally, people talking about this issue know that anxiety seems to be increasing compared to other things,” Barreira said.
Rates of depression among incoming freshmen have fluctuated between 7.8 and 11.6 percent over the past eight years. From 2007 to 2011, the rates of anxiety among incoming freshmen hovered between 7.4 and 10.4 percent, but in 2015, the rates climbed to 11.6 percent. That figure indicates the percentage of students who report having experienced these mental health conditions during the year prior to their entrance to Harvard.
According to a national survey conducted annually by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, in 2015, 47.4 percent of students who utilized counseling services reported anxiety as a primary mental health concern, while 40.2 percent reported depression as a primary concern.
The format of the freshman survey at Harvard included the use of stem questions, providing supplemental questions for students who reported having experienced mental illness. These more detailed questions help identify whether or not students had experienced a mental illness by honing in on identifiable symptoms.
“If you answer yes, then they ask something else and they ask something else,” Barreira said. “So it’s pretty darn close to being clinical depression, and not just having a bad day.”
According to Barreira, another health survey conducted by HUHS in March showed that BGLTQ students are at a higher risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, but not suicidal attempts. The survey also showed that women experienced higher rates of depression and anxiety than men.
Surveys conducted by HUHS show rates of depression are about the same from freshman to senior year, yet rates of anxiety and panic attacks increase over the four years, according to Barreira.
As of March, the Counseling and Mental Health Services branch of HUHS has welcomed over 18,000 visits to date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, it might be difficult to picture Paul R. Curran, Harvard’s current Director of Employee and Labor Relations, decked out in a blue wrestlers’ singlet. He stands with the posture of a lawyer, often in a dark suit with a pinstripe-patterned shirt, but almost always grinning.
A colleague of his, Edward Nastari, a staff representative of the local chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, describes Curran as “a friend in the business,” and credits what he believes has been a distinguished career to Curran’s ability to grapple with the stakes on the table for both sides of any negotiation.
Indeed, Curran is no stranger to grappling with difficulties. Curran, who was the first wrestler to be inducted into the University of Massachusetts Boston’s sports hall of fame, said he relishes in the opportunity to tackle labor issues.
“I like labor relations because you get day to day problems between unions and management that you can fix and help everybody else do the operations of the day,” Curran said. “I take great satisfaction in resolving those issues—some are very complicated issues, getting people from different perspectives and trying to get a solution.”
A similar sort of grappling has engaged Curran since those early days on the University mat: first, in a position at the District Attorney’s office, and then in a seat at the bargaining table for many of the City of Boston’s major union negotiations during the past fifteen years. Finally, he arrived at Harvard after being recruited by University administrators.
But Curran did not enter the University during a period of stagnancy. Where before at the city, he was often knee-deep in negotiations at any given time during his career as a labor negotiator, he found himself similarly occupied once arriving on campus. The difference? The mat was emblazoned with a new insignia and the team across the room was not full of colleagues that he knew intimately, but rather strangers that were at the tail end of notably tense negotiations.
A FRENZIED START 
In September 2015, members of the bargaining unit for Harvard’s largest employee union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, received word that Bill Murphy, the University’s previous director of labor relations was leaving to assume a similar position at Northeastern University. The news was something like a disorienting bell, and momentarily knocked the negotiators askew in their talks. In the interim between Murphy’s departure and Curran’s appointment, deputy director Polly Scannell headed the negotiation process.
“We were fortunate to have a strong and experienced negotiation team, including a long-tenured Deputy Director who was soon joined by a seasoned new Director,” University Executive Vice President Katie Lapp wrote in an emailed statement.
Though he had dealt with similar labor issues in the past, and had certainly wrestled with some of the overarching tensions of impassioned negotiations, Harvard’s round of talks with HUCTW had already been off to a rocky start. To add to that, the biggest issue on the table was something that has been especially contentious the past few years: health care.
In 2014, Harvard rolled out a health benefits package for its non-unionized employees that was initially criticized for featuring copayments and deductibles that some professors argued would disproportionately burden faculty with family members. After faculty voted unanimously to ask the Harvard Corporation to revise the plan, the University amended that benefits package.
Though Curran entered the fray toward the end of the negotiations, at a time when many topics had been worked through and the preliminary background information had been established, he said he was “comfortable” at the bargaining table.
“It was actually kind of good for me to kind of jump in and be part of a negotiation,” Curran said. “I had to learn the University.”
Donene M. Williams, a member of the negotiation team for HUCTW, said that Curran’s presence neither positively nor negatively affected the process.
“When Paul Curran came, there was a little bit of a—it wasn’t a style change, but he’s new, and Harvard is an enormously complicated place,” Williams said. “Just having a new personality in the room, having to explain some things that until then we’d been able to use as shorthand—that had a little bit of an effect. I’m not sure I would even characterize it as positive or negative, it was just different.”
Bill Jaeger, Executive Director of HUCTW, said Curran was helpful in a “situation that needed somebody to come in and listen with a steady hand to keep things going,” but noted that negotiators were “sort of on [their] way to finding solutions” when Curran arrived.
Along with handling what Jaeger described as a “big, complicated and contentious talk,” Curran simultaneously had to get acclimated with the duties and stakeholders of his office.
“I had all these interviews with people that were set up to kind of meet and greet all the people I would have to deal with in the position,” Curran said. “I had interviews jammed from November to the New Year, so the hardest thing with the negotiations was getting up to speed with the topics because, even though the topics were very similar to what I’d dealt with in the city, they were very nuanced.”
He credits staying afloat during that jam-packed time period to the negotiation team that had been established at the start of the talks.
“They were already seven months deep in the negotiations, and it was well thought out—the team was well thought out, and they were informed,” Curran said.
Though Curran was new to the negotiation tables at Harvard, Curran had encountered the issue before during his tenure in the City of Boston. Curran negotiated a health care benefits package that stretched across various city unions.
“It’s the same,” Curran said. “They’re different challenges, different problems, but it's similar.”
'I DON’T GO'
Those similarities run deeper than you would imagine. Curran and Murphy, his predecessor, share a similar background. They both graduated from Suffolk Law School, and were, at some point, stationed in Boston’s Labor Relations department before coming to Harvard. At the city, Curran led the talks for dozens of the city’s unions, and occasionally parlayed with teacher unions in the city.
“The most complicated things are these negotiations, trying to have a similar theme across the board for all of the 40 unions as far as wages, health insurance, and proposals,” Curran said.
Handling labor relations at Harvard and in Boston is not an altogether different game, according to Curran. The two are similar in the sheer number of employees considered at both institutions. Curran estimates that a “ballpark of 19,000” employees are employed by both Harvard and the City of Boston, although Boston has a higher percentage of unionized workers than Harvard.
Financially, the cost of providing benefits for such a large volume of unionized employees can be staggering. David Sweeney, Chief Financial Officer for the City of Boston, credits what he believe is Boston’s strong track record for managing personnel costs to Curran’s skill at the negotiation table.
“It’s hard to overemphasize the importance of the labor office with over 90 percent of our workforce unionized,” Sweeney said. “He always thought very strategically about what made sense for the city in terms of coming to a deal. It’s a very big loss to the city that he went over to Harvard.”
Curran said he has no intention of leaving Harvard anytime soon.
“I don’t go,” Curran said, chuckling. “I was in the DA’s office for seven years, I was the city for 15. I stay unless I’m getting the boot.”
He credits that to a mission-driven approach to public service.
“I like to be part of something that has a mission to it — I see my role as helping the mission,” Curran explained. “It may be a bit goofy, but I do.”
For Curran, and the Labor Relations Department as a whole, the upcoming summer presents another round of grappling over contentious issues. UNITE HERE Local 26, a Boston-based hotel and food service workers union that represents Harvard’s dining services employees, is set to begin negotiations with the University this June.
Thus far, the situation has been tense. Aided largely by the Student Labor Action Movement, HUDS workers have held a series of rallies and events in advance of the negotiations, pushing for a stronger health care benefits package, higher wages, and increased employment time at the University. Last week, over 200 Harvard affiliates staged a rally in front of Massachusetts Hall where workers reiterated their goals for the upcoming negotiations.
Curran said he plans on focusing on the upcoming negotiations and establishing a “good working relationship” between campus unions and management, especially considering how new he is to the campus.
“It takes time for people to trust you,” Curran said. “You can’t get deals together if people don’t trust you.”

With the stress of submitting a senior thesis behind them, some students now face a new challenge of presenting and defending their findings to faculty and peers.
Although thesis defenses differ across departments, students are typically expected to elaborate on and address arguments developed in their thesis to a panel of faculty and advisors.
“It was definitely nerve wracking,” said Madi L. Taylor ’16, a Psychology concentrator who defended her thesis last week. “But I actually really enjoyed it because it’s a chance to talk to people who really knew what you’ve been spending so much time working on.”
According to Taylor, the Psychology department holds a two-hour poster session in which concentrators spend one hour viewing other students’ posters and presentations, and the second delivering a thesis defense, given that one’s own committee is available that day.
Within the Psychology department, the defense is worth 20 percent of the thesis grade, according to Elizabeth D. Mahon ’16.
“Your defense happens last, so they will be very influenced by it,” Mahon said. “They may have an idea of your grade, but after your defense, it could go up or down.”
According to Mahon, she had to present her thesis twice prior to her official defense: both in front of the graduate students at her lab, and at the open-floor poster session, at which her committee was not present. She considered the two presentations as practice for her defense.
“Presenting in the lab and on the open floor, I did feel nervous but I knew I would not get graded,” Mahon said. “Before I was defending, I was really nervous and I had to do some mental exercises before going in.”
Mason S. Barnard ’16, a Social Studies concentrator, also had the opportunity to present his thesis before his official defense.
Barnard, who presented his thesis to his peers in Quincy House—which he described as a “chill environment”—is defending his thesis next week. He said that unlike a defense, presentations are more geared toward people unfamiliar with the field, and when presenting, students are “trying to build a narrative.”
“Preparing for the defense is much more scary than the defense itself,” Barnard added.
Josh W. Bean ’16, a Music and East Asian Studies joint concentrator, presented his thesis at a senior thesis colloquium in February, several weeks before his thesis was due. At the colloquium, faculty posed questions, challenged arguments, and made suggestions.
“Usually the faculty ask more challenging questions,” Bean said. “But afterwards there was a reception where people could talk to each other about their topics.”
Taylor emphasized that although there can be tension surrounding the presentation, the defense is the climax of months of research and dedication that comes with writing a thesis.
“It’s really the culmination of all that hard work,” Taylor said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House residents have begun a process to investigate the controversial past of their House’s namesake.
At an event hosted by Mather’s House Committee, undergraduates, along with the House's Faculty Deans and Resident Dean, began planning a larger effort to remember Increase Mather, a former Harvard president and slave owner.
In addition to serving as President of Harvard College in the late seventeenth century, Increase Mather was a Puritan minister and involved in the Salem Witch Trials, Mather owned a slave named Spaniard.
The project involves examining documents from the Harvard University Archives and a number of books about Harvard and Increase Mather’s history.
According to Avni Nahar ’17, one of Mather’s HoCo chairs, the project ultimately aims to provide students with a fuller understanding of their home.
“It’s just important for us to know more about this place that we live in and spend so much time, and this name we use so much what it actually means,” she said.
Mather House’s initiative comes as Harvard discusses controversial symbols on campus, and colleges and universities nationwide grapple with race relations in light of recent controversies at Yale and the University of Missouri. University President Drew G. Faust has emphasized the importance of recalling sensitive parts of the University’s history. Faust said she disapproved, however, of changing titles and building names en masse, as Harvard should work on “sustaining our history, not erasing it.”
Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten voiced similar sentiments at Thursday’s event.
“I think the main thing is to acknowledge it and not bury it,” he said, referring to Increase Mather’s slaveholding.
Earlier this month, Faust dedicated a new plaque on Wadsworth House to four slaves who lived and worked on Harvard’s campus during the eighteenth century. Faust also wrote a Crimson op-ed reiterating her support for these projects.
“We need to understand the attitudes and assumptions that made the oppressions of slavery possible in order to overcome their vestiges in our own time,” Faust wrote in her op-ed. “In more fully acknowledging our history, Harvard must do its part to undermine the legacies of race and slavery that continue to divide our nation.”
In addition to the Wadsworth House plaque, Faust said she convened a committee with historians Sven Beckert and Evelyn B. Higginbotham to study other locations on Harvard’s campus with histories intertwined with slavery and determine ways to memorialize those histories. Beckert directed a study in 2011 that found Harvard’s endowment in the past to be connected to the slave trade.
Recently, the Harvard Corporation granted Harvard Law School approval to discard the school’s seal given its historical connections to the Royall family, prominent slaveholders who helped endow the first law professorship at Harvard more than 200 years ago.

After years of low voter turnouts during its board elections of student representatives, the Harvard Coop changed its board recruitment process last year from open elections to formal applications.
The Coop has bylaws that require a minimum of five percent of registered members to vote in its board elections. Although the number of members have increased, it has become increasingly difficult to meet the required percentage of voters, according to current Coop President Jeremiah P. Murphy.
“The voter turnout, to be perfectly frank with you, had dwindled over the years, and I think that is typical with a lot of election based situations here in the academic community,” Murphy said.
In the past, the Coop re-ran elections until voter numbers passed the required percentage of members. The current board, however, changed the procedures.
“We thought it was best to not depend on necessarily getting a certain amount of votes,” he said.
Murphy added that the new process may allow the board to select better representation of the constituents of the Coop. Current board member Peter Wu ’16 said in previous years, the Coop had less control in filling different representative seats on the Board.
“There’s been an issue of sometimes having very skewed results,” Wu said. “One year you could have all applicants from MIT, and you [might] need to fulfill spots on the board that are supposed to be a Harvard undergrad, or Harvard grad seat.”
Wu said the change in recruitment of student board members aims to ensure that board applicants are committed and motivated to understand the needs of the student body whom they represent.
The deadline for applications passed on April 10. Following interviews with the Nominating and Governing Committee, the Board of Directors will elect the nominated applicants.
Since its change in the recruitment process, the Coop has had a sufficient number of student applicants for positions on the board.
“We’ve had more than enough students come forward,” Murphy said. “So it’s been a great candidate pool, and obviously it’s a tough situation for the nominating committee to choose, quite frankly.”
Wu said being a student Board member gave him exposure and experience in the professional setting of the cooperative.
“There are real-estate subcommittees, there are audit subcommittees, and finance subcommittees,” Wu said. “So if you have an interest in one of these fields, and perhaps wish to pursue a profession in one of these fields, it’s a really helpful opportunity to get exposure, and get your feet wet in some of these areas.”

Although students are not set to gather in Tercentenary Theater for Yardfest until 5 p.m. this Sunday, the party will be well underway around campus by that time.
In a collaboration with the Office of Student Life, the Undergraduate Council, and the House Committees, this year the College will hold four pre-Yardfest neighborhood block parties starting at 3 p.m. that day, each with free food, drinks, and entertainment.
Individual neighborhoods, which consist of three upperclassmen Houses, will each host their own festivities.
On the Quad lawn, residents of Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer Houses have been invited to enjoy a giant inflatable slide, photo booth, live music by a DJ, and Felipe’s nachos and churros.
Likewise, residents of the River East Houses—Mather, Leverett, and Dunster—can join their neighbors in Leverett Towers Courtyard for a bouncy house, cotton candy, and a live band.
Students of River Central Houses—Adams, Quincy, and Lowell—can expect to find many of similar attractions in the Lowell Courtyard, as can those of River West Houses—Eliot, Winthrop, and Kirkland—in Winthrop House’s Gore Courtyard.
While emphasizing that all four parties are open to all undergraduates and not just the residents of each neighborhood, Daniel V. Banks ’17, vice president of the UC and co-chair of Dunster HoCo, said he views the initiative as unprecedented in its scope and funding in his three years at the College.
“This is not going to be your regular Stein Club,” Banks said. “This is going to be a massive event, and four of them will be going on across campus, and everyone is invited. This is something that has never been done before.”
Mather HoCo co-chair Trevor A. Mullin ’17 agreed. Speaking to the history of his own House, Mullin said last year was the first time he recalled that his House hosted an independent pre-Yardfest event.
“This year we really wanted there to be a larger, more inclusive space for all House residents to come beforehand to feel like they’re part of a bigger community,” he said.
Funding for the neighborhood block parties primarily came from the OSL, with additional money from the Undergraduate Council and individual HoCos, according to Emily S. Rutter, a Fellow for House Programs at the OSL, and multiple HoCo chairs.
The neighborhood socials come amid ongoing discussion on campus about social spaces, House life, and the responsibility of the College to stymie the influence of off-campus groups.
“I think a really important part of what we’re trying to do is to make sure that House life continues to be vibrant,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said.
He added that the OSL is listening to student input in an effort to create social alternatives and events on campus, which in the past have included new social spaces, pilot approaches to registering social events in the Houses, and a revived music scene.
Mullin argued that because of the availability of social spaces on campus, some organizations have developed a “monopoly on outside pregames and garden parties before Yardfest.”
“We know that other organizations do have pregames, but those are quite exclusive,” Mullin said. “And not that these [neighborhood block parties] would compete with those, but we’d really like to have more events where any community member from our House, and also other Houses, can feel welcome in their communities and can partake in the festivities before Yardfest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Perhaps the harshest reality of sports is the knowledge that, in tournament-style competition, the vast majority of players will end their careers with a loss.
The road to first place is a one-way highway, and for the lucky athletes who speed towards victory, the destination seems preordained.
But along this road, strewn in ruts and marshy puddles, lie the remnants of other teams. It is a landscape filled with role players, stars, and even superstars who differ in all respects except for one: the shared emotional heaviness that accompanies an unfulfilled goal.
Thursday night, in a playoff matchup against George Mason, the season did not end the way that Harvard men’s volleyball wanted it to. But it ended nonetheless.
With a spot in the EIVA finals on the line, the Patriots (17-11, 11-4 EIVA) stomped the Crimson in University Park, Penn. It took three sets and just over an hour, and by the time the last spike had rolled to a stop, one team was heading to the championship while the other was heading home.
“As a team, I don’t think we felt comfortable at any point in the game, which was very atypical for us,” captain Branden Clemens said. “Sometimes it’s tough to find your rhythm.”
The ship began to tip midway through the first set, when George Mason senior Paco Velez could not miss a serve. By the time Velez toed the line, the score was 16-8, and Harvard had already called a let’s-calm-down timeout at 11-5.
Still, with four consecutive aces, Velez turned a lopsided scoreboard into a surreal rout. The back-to-back-to-back-to-back performance propelled the Patriots to a 25-11 win in the set—the largest margin of defeat that the Crimson (13-11, 9-6) had stomached all season.
In that first frame, George Mason hit a scorching .591 and recorded more blocks than errors. Meanwhile Harvard recorded a .105 kill rate.
“That set was a beat-down,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “It was just our serve-receive. We weren’t passing well at all in that first set.”
For the Patriots, Velez and fellow outside hitter Christian Malias each tallied 11 kills. Playing through 6’7” setter Brian Negron, who racked up 35 assists, George Mason eclipsed .400 for the sixth time this season.
That offensive efficiency shone through in the third set, when the Patriots used another set of service aces to pull away.
An attack error by Velez had closed the George Mason lead to 15-14, but the Patriots fought back with a kill from Radoslav Popov. Then, when Popov began to serve a few points later, he rattled off two aces that effectively put the match out of reach. The Crimson dropped the frame, 25-21.
“We couldn’t put it all together, I guess,” Schlossman said. “George Mason did a good job of keeping the pressure on us.”
Playing in the final contest of a decorated career, Clemens led his squad with nine kills on 21 attacks. Schlossman added eight finishes.
However, the team as a whole never gained traction after its muddy start. Sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch, normally a solid offensive contributor, racked up seven errors versus four kills. And junior libero Samuel Murphy, who had played a key role in last weekend’s competition, ended with four reception errors.
Yet no one individual deserved all the blame on an afternoon when the Patriots refused to relinquish the leads that they built.
In the second set, Harvard remained within four at all times after George Mason claimed a 6-5 advantage. But the lead never changed hands—not with Clemens serving at 9-8, Schlossman serving at 10-9, sophomore setter Marko Kostich serving at 12-12, or Gretsch serving at 13-13.
Ultimately late kills from Velez and Negron carried the day, delivering the 25-21 set to the Patriots.
“This loss stinks, but this one loss doesn’t represent us as a team,” Clemens said. “Nor does it represent [our] fight and overall charisma.”
In addition to marking the end of the season, the defeat marked the end of career for a trio of seniors—Clemens, Schlossman, and libero Alister Bent.
Every year that group has made the four-team EIVA playoffs. But every year the season has concluded the same way: with the inconsolable hurt of tournament defeat.
“It went fast, really,” Schlossman said. “These last four years playing for the team were some of the best moments of my life. I’d tell the younger guys, ‘Just enjoy it because it’s going to be over pretty soon.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week after rattling off eight runs in the first three innings of its penultimate nonconference game, the Harvard softball team was at it again in Providence on Wednesday as it wrapped up out-of-league play.
Up against the Friars at Glay Stadium, the Crimson (21-14, 9-3 Ivy) scored seven times in the opening three frames, paving the way for a 8-2 Harvard win—its 10th in the last 11 games.
“We jumped on them right away,” co-captain Zoe Galindo said. “All parts of our game worked really well…. The hitters came out full swing, and we made some really good defensive plays that shut the door pretty early. We played like Harvard softball should, so it was really fun.”
Harvard came out swinging right off the bat, scoring three runs in the top of the first. Freshman Rhianna Rich, who went 3-for-4 on the day, led off with a single to the left side of the infield, and Galindo followed suit with a single of her own. Then after a walk to freshman Meagan Lantz filled the bases, junior Giana Panariello singled up the middle, sending Rich home and record the first RBI of the game.
Providence (16-23, 2-9 Big East) nearly escaped the inning without enduring any further damage after turning a double play that took out Galindo and junior Catherine Callaway. But with Lantz and Panariello having advanced into scoring position, senior Haley Davis plated them both with a single to center.
Providence answered back with a run of its own in the bottom of the first, but Harvard quickly widened the gap once again with two more tallies in the second and another two in the third.
The second inning saw three Crimson doubles by freshmen Kaitlyn Schiffhauer, Rich, and Lantz. Rich’s double drove Schiffhauer home while, two batters late, Lantz’s hit sent Rich across the plate.
With the score 5-1, Davis singled to start of the third and junior Savannah Bradley ripped a double to left field to drive home the sixth run for Harvard. Bradley would later capitalize on a wild pitch to take home and score the second run of the inning.
The Friars responded by notching another run in the bottom of the third, as Kiki Baldassari stole home to log her second run of the game, but they still faced a 7-2 deficit and were unable to break through for the rest of the game.
The final run of the game came in the top of the sixth when Lantz recorded her second double of the game to drive Rich home and further secure the Crimson advantage. Lantz leads Harvard with 33 runs batted in on the year—12 ahead of sophomore Maddy Kaplan, who ranks second on the team.
“There [weren’t] any big plays throughout the game,” junior Jillian Leslie admitted. “We just had a lot of hits stored in us that we just let out today. It was a nice day to play ball and a nice stadium. Everyone contributed—our defense, our offense, and our pitchers. It was all around a really good effort.”
Harvard pounded away at the Friars throughout the game, tallying up a total of 14 hits across the seven innings.
Meanwhile, junior Taylor Cabe and freshman Sarah Smith combined to hold Providence in check on the hill. Cabe’s performance over the first three innings earned her her 12th win of the year, while Smith relieved Cabe and threw four hitless innings. Both pitchers recorded two strikeouts.
“Our pitchers did really well,” Galindo said. “Taylor came out with a good start, and Sarah threw really really well in the latter half of the game.”
The Crimson’s impressive offensive performance follows a meeting with Yale last weekend where Harvard tallied six runs in the first inning alone.
“I don’t think, as a senior, in my four years that we’ve had a team that scored so often in the first inning as often as this team has,” Leslie said. “We’re just coming out in the mindset to swing the bat hard, not thinking too much about things. Once things start going, people are getting on, people are seeing the ball, everyone relaxes.”
“And when we relax,” she added, “we play our best.”
