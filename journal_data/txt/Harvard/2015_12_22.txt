After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and railroad company CSX Transportation completed a deal that gave the University full rights to more than 19 acres of Allston land, one of several recent Allston land deals between Harvard, CSX, and the Massachusetts state government.
In 2000, Harvard bought a 47-acre parcel of land known as Allston North Landing for more than $150 million, within which the recently negotiated 19.6 acres are located. A new complex for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the most ambitious development in Harvard’s current Allston plans, will also be located on the 47-acre parcel.
CSX retained easement rights on the 19.6 acres and on a neighboring 91-acre plot Harvard bought in 2003, allowing the company to continue railroad operations in the area. At the time of purchase, the properties held train tracks, personnel and mechanical buildings, and other structures, all south of Harvard’s current construction sites in the neighborhood. 
Harvard now possesses full rights to the Allston North site and can develop on all land formerly used by CSX, according to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications.
The recent deal, made on Wednesday, marks the last step in the cleanup and acquisition process begun in 2007, Casey told the Boston Globe. In 2007, Harvard and CSX finalized plans to phase CSX facilities out of the area, as the company’s rail operations relocated to nearby Westborough and Worcester, Casey said.
Harvard has laid out a 10-year plan for its Allston expansion in a blueprint, the Institutional Master Plan, approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority in 2013. The plan designates Allston Landing North as the site of both a $1 billion SEAS building and a new park. The park would comprise part of a “greenway” of parkland envisioned to connect Harvard’s Allston developments.
Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said he believes Harvard’s decision to use some of its Allston property for parkland will aid in the area’s development.
“I think a great analogy to this area is how the Back Bay was developed,” Mattison said. “When the Back Bay was created, the first thing they did is they built the public garden, and they created the plan for...the linear park that was then going to go through the whole rest of the Back Bay and bring people to the public garden.”
Mattison said he thinks the evolution of the Allston site could follow a similar path. In particular, Mattison advocates the construction of what Allston residents term the “People’s Pike,” a proposed recreational path for walkers, joggers, and cyclists that would connect Harvard campus, the Charles River, and the Allston neighborhood.
“[A] People’s Pike...would...make the entire area such a nicer place to be and such a better place to live or work or travel through,” Mattison said.
Galen M. Mook, another Allston resident, said that the construction of the new SEAS complex would also constitute a positive step. Two-thirds of the school’s faculty members are slated to move across the Charles in 2020.
“Frankly, the spot was used for heavy industry for so long,” Mook said, adding that new sciences building would be “a net plus for the neighborhood.”
As Harvard continues its Allston expansion, Mook emphasized the importance of developing open, productive communication between Harvard administrators and Allston residents.
“Historically, there has been a lot of distrust between Harvard and Allston residents,” Mook said. “We need to get over that, have Harvard be as good a neighbor as possible, and work with them to encourage the best kind of development possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walter J. Leonard, who drove the adoption of affirmative action admission policies at Harvard and is credited with increasing student body diversity at the University, died in Kensington, Md. on Dec. 8. He was 86.
His wife, Betty S. Leonard, told The New York Times the cause of death was complications of Alzheimer’s disease.
“Walter was a pioneer in advocating for the values of inclusion that are critical to higher education in our nation,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 wrote in an emailed statement. “He served as an enduring role model for everyone committed to ensuring that higher education remains open to students from all backgrounds.”
Leonard arrived at Harvard in 1969 from Howard University, taking the position of assistant dean and assistant director of admissions at Harvard Law School. There, he focused on  increasing the diversity of the Law School’s student body, particularly emphasizing the recruitment of minority and female students.
In a later interview with The Crimson, Leonard said he thought the increase in number of black, female, and Latino students attending the Law School during his tenure was one of his most significant accomplishments.
In 1971, when Derek C. Bok transitioned from Law School Dean to University President, Leonard followed him to Massachusetts Hall to serve as his special assistant. Leonard remained in that position until leaving Harvard in 1977 to become president of Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville.
As special assistant to Bok, Leonard served as Harvard’s affirmative action officer—or what one protesting student called the school’s “affirmative action czar”—writing an affirmative action plan for the University, and at times openly critiquing its treatment of women and minorities.
Part of his University-wide plan allowed Harvard’s admissions departments to begin considering race and ethnicity on a case-by-case basis in the admissions process, just as they considered other factors. The plan became a model for other universities.
Leonard “set in place something that a lot of schools tried to model their affirmative action policies on,” said Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia. “Anybody who knows much about affirmative action knows that his efforts to create an atmosphere of difference in terms of the composition of the student body at Harvard were significant not just at Harvard, but for the entire country.”
The plan has long commanded respect in legal circles, and the Supreme Court, in a 1978 decision, cited what it called “the Harvard plan” as a constitutional model for an actively race-conscious admissions policy.
Today, Harvard’s policies are being challenged in court by groups who allege the College’s admissions process discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Another ongoing affirmative action case, Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin, could set a precedent for Harvard’s lawsuit. The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments for the Fisher case, in which a white woman who was denied admission alleges the school’s admissions department discriminates based on race.
Outside of drafting Harvard’s affirmative action plan, Leonard was an advocate for students of color, penning a Crimson opinion editorial in which he praised universities for increasing their number of minority students, but noted that these students faced particular scrutiny once they arrive on campus.
“Minority students within predominantly white institutions of higher learning have become the most visible people on earth. Their tower, instead of being of ivory, is of the most transparent glass,” Leonard wrote. “They are tested, touted, tracked, and tantalized with visions of glorious opportunity.”
Despite his role in shaping Harvard’s affirmative action policies, Leonard left the University concerned that Harvard’s efforts to create a diverse campus were not moving quickly enough.
“Year after year I still see barriers to progress,” Leonard said at a farewell dinner before leaving Harvard. “I don’t understand how an institution so rich, so endowed, and so blessed can be so calloused.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s Basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason picks three things to keep an eye on going into tomorrow’s Diamond Head Classic quarterfinal between Harvard and BYU (4:30 PM, ESPNU). Before a two-week break for finals, the Crimson (3-6) defeated Boston University, 75-69. The Cougars (7-3) have won three of their last four contests.
CONTAINING COLLINSWORTH
Senior guard Kyle Collinsworth is the focal point of the BYU offense and was an honorable mention All-American last season. The Cougars’ co-captain had 12 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds in BYU’s win last Friday against Central Michigan. The triple-double was the eighth of his career, the most in NCAA history. On the season, Collinsworth is averaging nearly 15 points a game to go along with eight rebounds and seven assists.
Tuesday will not be the first time Harvard has squared off with an elite wing this season. The Crimson has already seen the likes of Providence senior Kris Dunn and Kansas junior Wayne Selden. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker will likely task senior forward Agunwa Okolie with covering Collinsworth. Despite giving up 32 points to Dunn, Okolie has held his matchups to outputs well below their season averages, with Selden only going for nine points and Boston College guard Eli Carter shooting 3-for-14 from the field.
While Collinsworth contributes to all facets of the Cougar offense, BYU may be the most balanced and deepest team the Crimson has faced this season. The Cougars have four players averaging double-digits in points and nine players logging at least 10 minutes a contest.
OFFENSIVE OUTBREAK
Harvard’s slow start to the season could be attributed to a lack of production on the offensive end. Through the team’s first six games, the Crimson was averaging just under 62 points per game, but in its last three, Harvard has topped that mark by nearly ten points a contest.
While the Crimson has lost two of its last three games, both contests were against teams that made the NCAA Tournament last season. The team has shot over 43 percent in all three of those games and has had a different leading scoring in each contest. Harvard posted its best ball control game of the season two weeks ago against BU, turning the ball over just 10 times.
KEEPING PACE
In order for Harvard to compete with BYU, the Crimson will have to continue its recent offensive surge while also shutting down a potent and balanced BYU offense. The Cougars are averaging nearly 83 points a game and are outscoring their opponents by an average of 10.5 points. BYU has been held under 75 points just twice in 10 games.
The game will certainly be a clash of two styles. Harvard has not scored 83 points in a game this season, but the Crimson has conceded more than 75 points just twice this season. Harvard ranks 295th in the nation in possessions per game while the Cougars are 17th. Like the Crimson, BYU has struggled with turnovers, averaging more than 13 a contest.
