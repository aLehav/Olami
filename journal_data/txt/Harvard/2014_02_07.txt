After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
“Così fan tutte” roughly translates to “women are like that,” but it should translate to “make the best of what you’ve got.” The Dunster House Opera’s production of the opera written by Wolfgang A. Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte, which will be performed from February 5 to February 9 at the Agassiz Theatre, has a frustrating storyline with inherent, misogynistic undertones. Bersin brings these issues to the forefront, updating the opera to make it a ’60s sex comedy. Though the production is not without its pacing problems, director Madeleine F. Bersin ’14 injects a sense of humor into an unpalatable plotline to create an amusing adaptation with ironically humorous directorial choices and great caricatural performances from the actors.
 
Ferrando (Andrew J. Troska ’17) and Guglielmo (Eric Padilla ’14) are happily engaged to sisters Dorabella (Allison A. Ray ’14) and Fiordiligi (Amelia H. Ross ’14) respectively. That is, until the two men come upon the older, jaded Don Alfonso (Levi M. Roth ’14). He bets that both of their fianceés will prove unfaithful if given the chance. The two confident young lovers accept the wager, and increasingly absurd attempts to win the affection of the two women ensue..
 
While all the actors give strong performances, Troska stands out. His gestures and movements, in addition to his expressive singing, make the libretto more accessible to the audience even when his voice is drowned out by the orchestra. Troska’s success lies in his instinct for physical comedy. When the two men are in disguise they pretend to be poisoned in order to inspire the sympathy of the women; he lies on the floor and shakes his legs feverishly and grasping his neck to exaggerate the effects of the fake poison. Troska’s choice to highlight the ludicrous themes through his comical acting is in line with Bersin’s new take on the opera.
 
The choice to play up slapstick elements of the opera underscores the sexist themes of “Così fan tutte.” In doing so, the production simultaneously brings these themes to attention and subverts them. For example, when Ferrando and Guglielmo masquerade as different men to test the faithfulness of their fiancées, they express their testosterone by grabbing their crotches and behaving in other caricatured, sexist ways. The costuming of the scene reinforces this effect: the two are dressed in magnificently clashing ’60s costumes that include high-waisted pants, green and yellow sunglasses, and two fabulous fake mustaches, in contrast to the more subdued clothes of the other characters.  What better way to show that the motivations of these characters are ridiculous than to purposefully dress the main characters in ridiculous outfits?
 
The lighting by Gabrielle M. Walti ’14 and set design by Heather D. Mauldin ’14 play up the themes of the production. The garish pink and red are a good choices for an opera that deals so much with the themes of love and desire. Although the usages of the dramatic lighting was sparse, it was extremely effective when used. Moreover, the colored lighting adds to the pink and red walls that serve as another physical embodiment of lust and frame the majority of the action.
 
Although the opera does many things well, however, the uneven pacing impedes the fluidity of the plot. Many scenes could have been cut or melded together in such a way that would conform to a more modern, high-paced tempo. The first half is more energetic, but the second half drags. In several instances—such as the seduction scenes in the second act—it takes three scenes to do what one could have accomplished. While Bersin was trying to stay true to Mozart’s opera,, her rendition could have benefited from cutting scenes to streamline the plot; her goal of making this opera accessible to modern viewers is hindered by this uneven pacing. However, even if the dragging second act ultimately weighs down the production, quality acting, lighting, singing and set design help mitigate the sexist themes of the opera, which is a feat by itself.

About a quarter of the way into “The Monuments Men,” Frank Stokes (George Clooney, a moustache transplanted onto his usual sexy stubble) radios the rest of his crew with a pep talk of sorts. They may not be trained soldiers, he says, and the army may not be behind them, but their mission—to trek through war-ravaged Europe, saving art from the Nazis who stole it—is worth every risk. After all, what is a country, a culture, without its art? 
This is a laudable message, and a relevant one considering the shaky ground on which the arts rest in today’s economic climate. It’s just a shame that the message has to be delivered via “The Monuments Men,” perhaps the worst film George Clooney has ever directed. It may seem like a delight on the surface, but don’t let the snappy pace and absolutely loaded cast fool you; the film is, at its core, a sloppily told story and a tonal mess.
The premise seems appealing enough: Clooney’s Stokes, an art conversation expert based on the real-life George L. Stout ’29, is assigned to travel through late-WWII Europe to locate and return stolen art objects, among them van Eyck’s “Ghent Altarpiece” (Stokes calls it “the very foundation of modern society,” so you know the stakes are high). For backup, he recruits a motley crew of fellow art experts, starting with Matt Damon ’88-’92 as Metropolitan Museum curator James Granger and continuing on with a cadre of characters played by Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville.
 Plugging a WWII scenario into the “Ocean’s Eleven” formula must have looked great on paper, but unfortunately for this film, Clooney lacks Steven Soderbergh’s knack for handling large casts. The mismanagement begins with the opening credits, which double as a recruitment montage. Where “Ocean’s Eleven” used these short scenes to introduce key attributes of its players, the “Monuments Men” montage plays wordlessly, simply showing Stokes approach his recruits and then cutting quickly to them donning their uniforms. While they’re admittedly first seen in different settings, it would be impossible to differentiate these men without the famous faces inhabiting them, as their characters are relatively undeveloped. There’s no struggle at all convincing anyone to enlist, since none of the recruits seem to have homes, families, or really any sort of backstory.
 Once the plot gets moving, there’s a vague goal—saving as much art as possible—but the film mostly feels like a series of vignettes, with the team splitting up and heading across Europe. And while this fragmentation works from time to time, the segments often feel jumbled. Clooney seems lost in the shuffle for most of the film, so he gets a clumsy voiceover to keep him established as the main character. The real fumble, though, comes with the portrayal of Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett, whose best shot at a French accent is…okay). For some reason, her story is interspersed among the beginning of Stokes’s mission even though it seems to take place years earlier. And though she begins the film a potential protagonist with her own story, once she crosses paths with the Monuments Men , or really just Damon’s Granger, she is reduced to little more than a love interest and plot device. 
 Despite the film’s confused structure, the vignettes can be quite effective when taken on their own, especially when the fine cast members are allowed to flex their comedy chops. Goodman and Dujardin can ham it up with the best of them, but it’s obvious that the writers saved the strongest of what little material they had for the duo of Murray and Balaban. In a scene particularly rife with deliciously funny tension, the pair’s encounter with a young German private leads to a riotous stand-off—which soon devolves into more of a sit-off—with Murray’s expert deadpan counterbalancing Balaban’s twitchiness. It’s a special delight to see Balaban, who last stole the show as the narrator in “Moonrise Kingdom,” getting solid screen time and some tasty jokes to boot.
 The problem is that the movie just isn’t funny enough to warrant its silly tone. Many jokes, like Granger’s inability to speak French, are stretched too far, while others simply fail to land. It would have been a better use of energy to flesh out the promising dramatic threads in the film, like the story of Bonneville’s character, Donald Jeffries, who has a particularly touching personal connection to the Michelangelo “Madonna and Child.” Tragedy and tension are present in the film, but the balance is off, and the finale, though perhaps true to life, is a clockwork anticlimax. 
 “The Monuments Men” is an entertaining enough film, but it’s too fun a romp to ever feel like it matters much, and part of this could be its laser-like focus on the experience of middle-aged art geeks. Where it could have said something meaningful about art and the societies of war-torn countries, the film instead offers Matt Damon looking at a sculpture and exclaiming, “Holy shit.” The real-life monuments men were bona fide heroes who stood up for culture in its time of need. What’s most disappointing about Clooney’s film is not that it fails to do the same, but that it barely even tries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With another semester at Harvard comes another series of course lotteries. It is a familiar story: Each shopping week, many students find themselves lotteried out of one, two, three, four, or even five classes they wanted to take. Rejection is always disappointing, albeit sometimes unavoidable. However, since students often are not notified of their status until very late into shopping week, the current lottery system leaves students not only dissatisfied but also panicked as they struggle to assemble a new schedule right before study card day. To alleviate this nerve-wracking uncertainty, Harvard should hold course lotteries earlier, allowing unlucky students more time to reorganize.
Shopping week is certainly a distinctive feature of the Harvard undergraduate experience. However, the specter of late course lotteries can turn a valuable opportunity into a scheduling nightmare. Instead of choosing classes based on careful consideration and interest, students who are rejected in such lotteries are often forced to pick random replacement classes at the last minute. Other students ask instructors to sign several different versions of their study cards in the hope that they will be lotteried into at least one of their anticipated possibilities. The current system creates unnecessary stress, defeating the experience of shopping week for many.
Instead, course lotteries should, whenever possible, be moved to before the start of school or to the earliest possible point in shopping week. If students already know the results of their lotteried classes well in advance of study card day, then they are able to explore other academic offerings in an unfettered, thoughtful way consistent with the spirit of shopping week.
We already have some precedent for this. For example, students apply to Freshman Seminars before school starts and are accordingly notified very early in the semester. This compensates for the inherent unpredictability of seminar placement and allows students ample time to adjust their schedules if necessary.
Courses that are predictably and consistently lotteried should follow this example. In fact, they are in the best position to do it. For instance, professors for these classes can make explicit that the course will be lotteried on iSites and conduct the lotteries before shopping week begins.
However, we recognize that some classes—often ones that satisfy a General Education requirement—experience sudden spikes in student interest that necessitate unforeseen lotteries. This is in large part a failure of the current pre-term planning system; however, early lotteries could still be possible. For instance, Harvard could require students to submit course preferences shortly before the semester begins, allowing professors to prepare early lotteries if necessary. If a course appeared to be oversubscribed, the instructor could hold a lottery immediately, and students would not have to suffer through an inconveniently timed waiting period.
This is, at best, an imperfect solution. Earlier course lotteries mean that students may not be able to adequately shop popular classes before they have to decide whether to lottery. Ideally, a more accurate pre-term planning system would minimize the need for lotteries in the first place. For now, a shift to earlier course lotteries would be an improvement over the current system and the last-minute scheduling frenzy it causes.

Individuals from all shades of the political spectrum frequently toy with the idea of isolationism, and why not?
The doctrine seemingly has something to offer to everyone. Used a tad loosely, I take isolationism to be the avoidance of interaction—both economically and militarily—with other countries. For libertarians, though the protectionist elements frequently associated with isolation seem abhorrent to a system of global free trade, the idea of non-intervention in distant conflicts draws them in. For liberals, isolation is a conduit for peacekeeping as well as a way to spur economic development at home, even if it comes with some suboptimal economic outcomes. And for conservatives, isolation seems to be a way to protect culture, tradition, and morality—things oft challenged by global opinion and influence.
In the United States, all three groups co-opt President Washington's farewell address as proof that their form of isolation is correct, each adopting the classically American crowd-pleasing stratagem of blending the “intent” of the Framers with the need to evolve out of the past, in degrees suitable to their political temperaments.
What is clear is that none of these groups (save any mercantilists that happen to still be alive) are willing to adopt more than a handful of isolationist beliefs, and instead rely heavily on making a hard distinction between something like non-interventionism and autarky. All insist you can have the former without the latter, that the way we deal with countries militarily can be separated from the way we deal with them economically.
The fact that there is virtual consensus on that concept troubles me.
One particular historical example fuelling this suspicion of mine is the Iranian Abadan crisis and subsequent British- and American-led coup d'état against the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. After Iran nationalized its oil resources, previously under British control, the CIA and MI6 organized the overthrow of Mossadegh and a reinstatement of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Though this is a particularly egregious example, the tale is one repeated with great frequency and only slight variation in imperial history. If an old colonial possession of the west (X) adopts a nation-building policy that conflicts with a western country (Y)'s dominance, Y batters and bullies X until either Y gets fatigued or X succumbs. It’s the closest to a mathematical formula that the study of history has.
What do our modern, piecemeal isolationists say to this dilemma? One might posit that the libertarians (which appears to be the group that most frequently makes the military-economic distinction in isolationism) would not have supported the coup, for it was (albeit disguised) military intervention in a foreign country. But what of the sustenance of free trade?
There is no question that Iran's nationalization of oil resources was an effrontery to the global free trade system. Countries cannot restrict foreign access in that way if free trade is to go on. Even when it is clearly best for its people, it is inefficient and incompatible with capitalism. If the libertarians say that military intervention is to be avoided at all costs, they must also give up the expectation that free trade will continue.
And no slippery slope argument need be made: Had the CIA and MI6 not staged the coup, the economic devastation to England could have been quite severe. Global capitalism does not work if all parties do not cooperate, and without a credible threat of military intervention, there is little reason to believe that cooperation will continue. If ex-colonial possessions possessions had all nationalized their resources one by one to the benefit of their citizens, our economic world would look radically different today.
In a sort of perverse way, the neo-cons, with their radical policy of intervention for capitalism at all costs, have a completely consistent (if incredibly immoral) system.
There is—of course—the other alternative that few of the mainstream elements of any ideology want to adopt, which is to completely abandon the global free market. In fact, only the extreme left would even consider the idea. I don't doubt that some consistent solution lies here, but it requires much more extensive effort and study than what would be required of the three ideologies to amend the way they present foreign policy.
It is very nice and pretty to say foreign policy can simply be broken down into military and economic components, where bad guys like to intervene and reap benefits while good guys don’t intervene and somehow reap equal benefits, but history simply does not comply.
Libertarians, liberals, and conservatives alike face a glaring contradiction and have no easy ideological rectification for the problem of isolationism.
It is their job to find one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When did I go from being an extraordinary child to an average adult?”
My roommate said it, but I felt it. (We know not to plagiarize here.) A fear that first struck me during shopping week freshman year now gnaws at my mind at the open and close of each semester. Fast-talking, philosophy-quoting peers at the preliminary meeting of a humanities course—before I’ve gotten my section legs—engender in me a creeping sense of inadequacy. Final exams—reminders of my largely superior competition—bring it back once again.
I am average. I am ordinary.
The initial onset of this gut-wrenchingly awful feeling comes with an easy explanation. It does not take a genius—in fact, it only takes someone average and ordinary—to figure out that, while there was only room for one valedictorian in your high school class, you can barely stretch your arms out at this place without hitting one in the face. Oh, you served as editor-in-chief of your illustrious high school paper? So did the rest of your comp class. Take a seat. Recent not-so-breaking news of grade inflation only confirms these worries: Even at our best, we no longer rest easy so many standard deviations ahead of the curve.
We are average. We are ordinary.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that. In fact, I’ve slowly but surely come to believe there’s a lot right with it.
The Harvard variation of a classic joke suggests that a student here needs no help changing a light bulb—not because he’s smart, but because he can simply stand still while the world revolves around him. Perhaps this misrepresents the bulk of the crowd that stands in the Tercentenary Theatre each year, about to walk out of Johnston Gate and into the real world. But many new matriculates enter the Yard having spent much of their young lives listening to parents and teachers sing their praises and declaim their brilliance. Some garner labels like “gifted” and later “honors,” and others bring home report cards studded with A after A after A-plus. The Harvard acceptance letter ices the cake. It ties shut the knot on each student’s balloon of an ego, a balloon that often needs a little deflating. Recognition of one’s relative ordinariness can do just the trick.
Coming to terms with being average, however, boasts more benefits than only the tempering of Harvardian hubris. If we reject the stigma attached to any term that does not suggest preeminence, we shed a heavy weight from our shoulders. “Gifted” and “honors” might initially evoke a pleasant, self-important feeling, but they also compel us to remain in the upper echelons of every single class, sport, club, and social group at all costs. Accepting averageness means relaxing for a moment. It means staying comfortably on the ground instead of wildly brainstorming ways to ascend every academic and extracurricular ladder in our paths.
It’s troubling that a word like “comfortable” can take on negative connotations here. Comfort does not necessary entail laziness or lack of ambition, both anathemas to the high achievers who stroll through these hallowed halls. Mostly, when it comes down to it, comfort goes a long way toward happiness. And happiness, in turn, goes a long way toward success. After all, we tend to like the things we do well.
We’re here for a reason. If we were remarkable before we came here, we didn’t become any less remarkable the day we turned in our freshman fall study cards. But madly striving to stand out can sometimes do more harm than good. Feeling like a failure can lead to over commitment, to stress, to near-breakdown, to more failure. It’s a vicious cycle, but also a breakable one. There’s an easy truth to embrace: We often do our best when we’re doing what we love. We do our best when we’re focusing on our passion for a hobby or activity or discipline rather than on where we stack up against our so-called competition. Basically, we do our best when we’re not worrying about being the best.
Ordinary scares us, but it’s time to stop being afraid. It’s when we start enjoying the ordinary that the extraordinary really begins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early this semester, the administration announced that Interim Dean Donald H. Pfister will step down in July. Although Harvard fungi have probably been celebrating non-stop in anticipation of Daddy’s return, most of Harvard’s non-tremella-fuciformis-beings have expressed sadness at the approach of his departure—myself included. Recent conversations I’ve had and Facebook statuses I’ve read about the charm of the dean have really got me thinking about his leadership last semester and what it has meant.
But after reflecting for a while, I’ve come to an odd realization: I’m actually kind of excited. Not because he is leaving. But because, even though he is not around for much longer, I think Pfister’s best is still to come.
Here’s why. In the past few years, and probably for a long time before that, there has been a separation between the student body and the administration because of their differing roles in the university. Harvard students are very individually oriented, pursuing their own groups and interests. It’s not that they are uncaring of others. It’s just that, after spending many hours deleting publicity emails from their inboxes, they don’t have time to care about most things happening on campus. In that way, students are technically “uncaring.”
By contrast, it is the administration’s job to educate, make funding decisions for, and care about all student interests. Its mindset is completely different—it’s caring. So there’s a tension between the students’ goals and the administration’s. The result: 12,000 eyes rolling after receiving another email from President Faust about the “iLab,” where the “i” apparently stands for innovative spelling.
But for a couple of unique and important reasons, that could really change this semester. With Pfister’s last hurrah as dean coming at the same time that Gus Mayopoulos is stepping in as UC President, we are about to experience a rare “ironic moment” in Harvard’s administration—a moment that could seriously reduce the gap between the administration and its “uncaring” students.
To see what I mean, let’s start with Sam and Gus. It’s pretty well accepted that student government is most effective in advocating for small, useful changes. Sam and Gus’s “joke” campaign capitalized on relating to voters’ ambivalence towards this limited power. There’s not much at stake in each election. So why not just vote for the funny guys who, through the irony of their campaign, implicitly signal they share the same sentiment of ambivalence as the student body? The uncaring voters appreciated their irony, and they were elected.
This appreciation also underlies Donald Pfister’s popularity. The Crimson’s editorial board has already shown great support for Pfister. And every student I’ve talked to has a positive opinion about him. But this feedback is not so much about Pfister’s policies, as much as it is about his emails. At worst, the emails read like the best botany reports ever. At best, they are pure poetry that cascade administrative information over waterfalls of fungal updates and suggested mystery readings, all while maintaining a whispering tone of fatherly quirkiness.
What kind of policy has Pfister enacted as Dean? I don’t really know. I don’t really care. And I think Dean Pfister knows that most students are focused on their own interests and, barring a big school-wide scandal, they aren’t really going to care that much either. So he made a pattern of sending light-hearted messages to students, and their admiration soon followed.
The ironic thing is that this lack of seriousness from both guys has the potential to connect the administration with the student body in a very serious way. The uncaring appreciate irony (see: hipsters) of a President like Gus or a dean like Pfister—or maybe Phipster—could draw more students into interaction with the administration through self-aware humor. Personally, I think I could better relate to an Undergraduate Council headed by Gus—a funny guy who acknowledges the council’s shortcomings—rather than a pre-professional, solemn candidate who may have unrealistically lofty goals for the UC and her CV. And I think I could talk to Dean Pfister, if not laugh with him for hours on end, as he calmly pats my shoulder, relating my problems to challenges fungal growths face in his lab.
Instead of being nerve-racking or boring, talking to the administration seems like it would actually be kind of fun now. And sure enough, increasing communications with students has become a primary goal for both administrators. Gus, since winning, has framed his role as President mostly around making the UC more open and connected with students. Dean Pfister has seemed to connect more with the student body than his predecessor did.
We’ll see if they can follow up on those trends and really make a difference this semester for the uncaring masses. In the meantime, I’ll be waiting on another email from my dean, seeing what comments he has on the wonders of winter fungal growth. Remember: you can’t spell “fungus” without “fun.” And, now that I think about it, you can’t really spell it without “Gus” either.
Strange…what does that say about…
Eh, I don’t care.

Rolling her head back against the driver’s seat and snapping her gum, M asked the question that had been ricocheting through the air since we all came home from college: “Where should we go?”
 
It had been the kind of winter break that can only happen in the suburbs, filled with basement parties, trips to the mall, and most of all, driving. Endless driving, directionless driving along curved roads covered dangerously in ice, driving through neighborhoods where we once rode bikes through the streets, driving at night with no one else on the road. Driving by our houses, our middle school, the deli parking lot that had once been the prime location for smoking and eating Pringles on the pavement.
 
The five of us had spent the past four months living separate, unconnected lives, but here we were again, crammed in the dirty white Toyota, jean-clad knees pressing against each other. The air smelled like our deli purchases, its fumes wrapping us together; we were united in our immobility, in our simple lack of places to go.
 
For kicks, we parked in front of the high school and I thought that we might as well still be students there, desperate to find a space between its sweaty hallways and our parents’ homes, somewhere along our local road, drifting by at 30 mph.
 
A soft buzzing sound, and we all pulled out our phones, grateful for the distraction. Soon the car filled with the sound of tapping fingers—E’s, the lucky receiver of the text message. M scraped her nails on the steering wheel. I rubbed my palms against my thighs. Otherwise, it was silent.
 
Since returning from Harvard, I had felt like I was speaking a different language. How could I tell stories about my life, when these stories included words like “entryway” and “HUDS” and “section”? TFs are TAs, and final clubs are like frats, but how do you explain a “comp”?
 
 I didn’t want to seem like I thought I was too good for the parking lot of our deli, or the parking lot of our high school—whose name didn’t end in the word “academy,” where Harvard might be the setting of a novel we read in English class but usually wasn’t a place we imagined for our futures. I didn’t want to seem like I was too good for the dirty car.
 
I guess the thing about Harvard that I really couldn’t translate, the thing that made it so different from my hometown, was that not once all semester had I wondered where to go. I was always going someplace, sometimes too many places, rushing between lectures and sections and meetings. There was no cruising, no drifting, no circling around and around some invisible epicenter—and not just because we weren’t allowed to have cars.
 
This was the primary language difference: at home, drive was something you did; at Harvard, it was something you had.
 
Unable to express this, I ate another Pringle and stared blankly at the windshield.
 
“I’m almost done with these. We could go back to the deli.”
M shrugged, and put the car into reverse. She stepped on the pedal, and we drove, exhaust fumes forming shapes in the air like cold breath on a winter day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 7, 2014, at 2:17 p.m.
Harvard, along with 110 other institutions of higher education, may be illegally misleading prospective students by providing unclear financial aid instructions, according to an investigation announced Monday by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
“It appears that 111 schools may be contravening the requirements of the Higher Education Act by explicitly requiring applicants to submit forms other than the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or by failing to make clear that only the FAFSA is required to be considered for federal student aid,” wrote Maryland Congressman Elijah E. Cummings—the ranking Democrat on the committee—in a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan '86 on Monday.
A spokesperson for Cummings wrote in an email to The Crimson that no schools were contacted during the investigation.
The Higher Education Act, amended by Congress in 1992, provides that higher education institutions must only use the free FAFSA form to determine federal financial aid for prospective students.
The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, a form administered by the College Board, helps colleges and universities determine specific levels of institutional aid, but is not needed for purposes of determining federal financial aid. Students must pay $25 to submit the PROFILE to one institution, and $16 for each after that. Students whose parents’ net assets exceed $33,720 are not eligible for are eligible for fee waivers provided by the College Board.
The committee’s investigation claimed that students could be spending money on the PROFILE, when in fact they need only to fill out the FAFSA for federal financial aid. In addition to its place on the list of 111 schools— which included every Ivy League university other than Princeton—Harvard was also accused of advising all students to fill out the FAFSA and PROFILE “without any explanation of use or purpose.”
Several universities have decided to change the wording on their financial aid websites in the wake of the Committee’s investigation, including Yale and the University of Pennsylvania.
“To be certain there is no further misunderstanding, we have reworked the language on our website to make this more clear,” Ron Ozio, the director of media relations for Penn, said in a statement to Bloomberg News.
Since the letter became public, the instructions on Harvard’s financial aid site have not changed. FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the University is still committed to providing clear information.
 
“We continuously review the information we provide to applicants and students—both online and in many daily interactions with financial aid officers—and will continue working to ensure that our students have the clear guidance they need to access the federal and Harvard-funded aid to which they are entitled,” Neal wrote.
Even if an applicant does not automatically qualify for a PROFILE fee waiver from the College Board, that student can contact Harvard directly to cover the cost, Neal added.
He also wrote that in almost every case, financial aid applicants should fill out both the FAFSA and PROFILE anyway.
 
“With few exceptions, nearly every Harvard College student who receives need-based federal aid is also eligible for Harvard aid, making it important that nearly every aid applicant completes both forms,” Neal wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fetal gender influences the quantity of milk produced by cows during lactation, according to a study co-authored by Human Evolutionary Biology assistant professor Katie J. Hinde and Kansas State University associate professor Barry J. Bradford. In the paper, published Monday on the open access journal PLOS One, Hinde and Bradford demonstrate that cows bearing female rather than male offspring produce higher quantities of milk.
The paper—which draws on both Bradford’s specialty in dairy nutrition and Hinde’s expertise in evolutionary biology—focused on dairy farms, one of America’s longest running industries. Yet the collaboration itself was born out of a distinctly 21st century communication.
Just over a year ago Hinde tweeted a blog post about differences in breast milk synthesized for male and female offspring. Weeks later, she received a direct message on Twitter from dairy nutritionist Bradford, who invited her to collaborate on a project that examined the relationship between fetal sex and milk synthesis in cows. After a cursory online search, Hinde joined forces with Bradford.
“The blog is really what started the research project,” Hinde said. “I got the direct message, and of course I Google searched for him, and he was legitimate, so I instantly said yeah, okay.”
Since calves are removed from their mothers immediately after birth, any difference in milk production cannot be attributed to behavioral interactions or postnatal “biased” milk synthesis. Instead, Hinde and Bradford’s finding posits a prenatal bias—one that occurs during pregnancy—in milk production for different genders.
“I suspected this was the case because functional development of the mammary gland actually happens during pregnancy,” Hinde said.
Hinde and Bradford analyzed years' worth of data from the Dairy Records Office, noting that the milk differed in quantity but not quality or composition. Moreover, since cows continue to lactate during their next pregnancies, cows that carry female calves in either their first or second pregnancy are likely to produce a higher volume of milk than cows carrying only males. 
Since the dairy industry already employs “sexed semen” to artificially inseminate cows, this study could have economic implications for the efficient production of milk. The report also raises questions about why female fetuses cause increased milk synthesis from an evolutionary perspective. Should further research suggest similar gender biases in milk production for humans, the findings could alter neonatal intensive care unit nutritional recommendations, milk donor matching, and infant formula for boys and girls.
“The most exciting science happens at the margins of fields, where they intersect,” Hinde said. “We know systematically that the greater the diversity of minds addressing a problem the more that research endeavor is improved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
New York Times architecture critic Michael S. Kimmelman discussed the design, occupation, and politics of public spaces, from parks to public transportation systems, in a lecture at the Knafel Center Thursday.
 
“So much of life in a city is spent in public spaces…. To me public spaces are integral to how we live, and the subject of architecture is also really about how we live,” he said in an interview before the lecture, which was open to the public and entitled “The Politics of Public Space.”
 
Kimmelman, who received a graduate degree in art history from Harvard in 1986, began his lecture with a description of his morning commute, detailing how every stop on his journey from his residence to Penn Station involved public spaces. He said his interest in public spaces stems from growing up in New York City and spending much of his life in public spaces.
 
He then discussed the political aspects of public spaces, such as efforts to create public spaces in the United States. One of the examples of successful public spaces he cited was former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s closure of Broadway to automotive traffic at Times Square, which helped to open the area to pedestrians. Kimmelman noted that commercial rents have doubled in that area after Bloomberg’s decision.
 
Kimmelman also criticized the trend of urban sprawl in U.S. cities and discussed how other cities are adopting sprawl as a model.
 
“Too many cities around the world are growing not denser, but larger, sprawling, by adding suburban-style gated subdivisions,” he said. 
 
As part of his analysis of sprawl, Kimmelman examined gated communities in Cairo, commenting on the 6th October Bridge, an automobile bridge next to Tahrir Square in Egypt.
 
Kimmelman talked about the relationship between public spaces and protests as well, such as the Occupy Wall Street Protests as well as other recent protests in Egypt, Turkey, and Brazil.
 
“Occupiers tend towards places like Zuccotti [Park in New York City] and Gezi [Park in Istanbul], places that look jammed and bustling with a few hundred people because the same crowds in Central Park would look puny,” he said.
 
Following the lecture, Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi, who introduced Kimmelman to the audience at the beginning of the talk, praised the architecture critic.
 
“Michael has really distinguished himself over the last 15 years, taking on board critical issues that affect our lives socially, politically, economically,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard defied a trend of administrative bloat experienced among U.S. private research institutions from 2000 to 2012, which saw on average a 24 percent decrease in the ratio of full time faculty and staff to administrators, a new report by the Delta Cost Project released Wednesday shows.
But while the University saw its own faculty/staff to administrator ratio increase by a little less than 20 percent over the same period, its 2000 figure of 1.57 to one was below the peer average at the time, meaning that despite gains in faculty and staff, Harvard is now on par with peer institutions at a ratio of 1.9 to one.
“[Administrative] growth, for the most part, has been greater at private universities for the past quarter century,” said Benjamin Ginsberg, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins who has written on the topic of administrative growth in higher education. “Some of the very top schools have resisted this, and that’s probably why they continue to be top schools. Harvard is one.”
The increase in Harvard’s proportion of non-administrators to administrators is in part thanks to its growth in faculty. Between 2000 and 2011, Harvard’s non-administrative full time employee count rose by more than 2000. Of those 2000 employees, however, core faculty members accounted for only a little more than 300, according to a cross-comparison of records in several editions of the Harvard University Fact Book. The remaining 1700 positions were added to clerical, technical, service and trades, non-core teaching and research areas, as well as support staff, the Fact Book shows.
 
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an email that the increase in tenured and tenure-track FAS faculty, from 586 in 2000 to a high of 722 in 2011-2012, was “a deliberate investment by the FAS and Harvard to grow our faculty and strengthen our faculty-to-student ratio, reflecting the priority for more involvement of faculty in teaching as well as research.”
Some staff growth, particularly in FAS, “reflects an effort to respond to undergraduate requests for more support in a host of areas,” Neal also wrote.
Growth in FAS’s employee roster comes in tandem with its curricular growth. In 2007, the University ratified the creation of the School of Engineering of Arts and Sciences under the purview of FAS and committed to its expansion. Previously, SEAS existed only as a faculty division.
A significant increase in its faculty/staff to administrator ratio took place after the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and subsequent administrative cuts. At the beginning of 2008, the ratio of faculty/staff to administrators stood at 1.55 to one, lower than the 2000 figure, the fact book shows.
While Ginsberg said that administrative growth can often lead to an increase in tuition, Harvard students have largely been insulated from these tuition drivers due to the large size of the institution’s endowment and financial aid funds. Since 2007, the year before the global financial crisis, the FAS budget for undergraduate financial aid has increased by more than 80 percent.
Private research universities were the only kind of institution that added full-time professorships—an average of 16 per 1,000 full-time-equivalent students—from 2000 to 2012, the Delta Cost Project report, “Labor Intensive or Labor Expensive? Changing Staffing and Compensation Patterns in Higher Education,”showed.
 
On average, across all U.S. institutions of higher learning, it found that the faculty/staff to administrator ratio has fallen by 40 percent, to approximately 2.5 to one.
In the report, faculty and staff referred to full-time faculty, part-time faculty, graduate assistants and instructors, whereas administrators entailed executive and managerial positions, such as provosts and deans, as well as support and service professionals, like health workers, human resources, and counselors.
The report argued that new administrative positions, particularly in student services, drove a 28 percent expansion of the public and private nonprofit higher education workforce from 2000 to 2012, a growth rate more than 50 percent faster than in the previous decade.
“It changes the character of education,” Ginsberg said. “For a professor, the purpose of a university is teaching and research.... To an administrator, especially to those who have never been professors, the purpose of teaching and research is to bring customers to the store.”
“Unfortunately,” he added, “more and more administrators have never been professors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
March 30, 2011 will always be “The Day the Music Died,” at least to me. That fateful Wednesday marked the end of my dreams of being a Princeton Tiger. My future in idyllic central New Jersey, clad in orange and black, died even faster than Mitch Henderson’s NBA career. I would not be part of the Jadwin Jungle, and I would not take part in a “P-rade,” whatever that might be.
As the hard copy of the rejection letter arrived (thank you Princeton, I really wanted to read it both online and in paper!), I was left with no other option–-it was time to release hatred upon this middling Ivy institution, the now-mediocre athletic teams it breeds, and the sad state in which it resides. Hey Penn, you’ve got me on your team…Puck Frinceton! Hey Dirty Jerz, thanks for being the armpit of America!
And so it was that I came to Harvard, ready to often cheer for and occasionally write about the Crimson. Over the course of my freshman year, Harvard sports faced off against Princeton dozens of times, with varied results. Some games proved to be bright-–I’ll never forget then-sophomore Kenyatta Smith doling out swat after swat as men’s basketball handled the Tigers at Lavietes, while a home win by women's basketball that snapped Princeton's 33-game Ivy League win streak stands out in its historic nature. But other moments proved not to be so sweet; many games were rather sour.
It started early in the year, as Tigers backup quarterback Quinn Epperly tossed a real nugget to Roman Wilson for a Princeton homecoming win to shock the preseason-favorite Crimson. 
The pain continued as the gridiron season gave way to ice and hardwood.
In early January 2013, two intrepid and charming Crimson sportswriters ventured deep into the belly of the Tigers’ den to cover a winter break ice hockey game. What began as a road trip soon turned to me holding my co-writer’s hair back as she vomited into the mean streets of Princeton. No, she had not fallen as an early victim of Newman’s Day but instead had contracted some sort of stomach virus in the few hours we’d been in this sleepy town. My guess was it was the Jersey water.
Just a quick hockey game later, and it was I who felt like puking after watching our hockey team open the New Year with a real doozy. Thanks, Tigers goalie Sean Bonar, for being a ginger. You really took that orange-and-black theme to a new level.
Days later, Princeton took down both men’s and women’s squash. Perhaps not all that surprising coming from “the pleasantest country club in America,” as Princeton alum F. Scott Fitzgerald not-so-fondly referred to his alma mater. Less to kvetch about here, but still, yikes.
Basketball season saw more trouble–the Crimson was stopped short by both the men’s and women’s teams whilst visiting Jadwin. Speaking of Jadwin, who on earth designed that arena? Last time I checked, a cavernous empty airplane hangar wasn’t an ideal shooting backdrop. I say it’s an inferiority complex at this point, not a basketball complex. If you were actually confident in your team’s ability to win games at home, you wouldn’t need to disable your opponents with blinding darkness.
And so it was that my freshman year saw some of the darkest moments in Harvard athletics come at the hands of the Ivy League’s very own trade school, Princeton.
This past fall, as Epperly yet again strutted his stuff up and down the field at Harvard Stadium to a triple overtime win (once again sealed by the evidently baby-soft hands of Wilson), I thought it might be time to rescind my hatred and beg at the knees of Janet L. Rapelye for a transfer admission. Newsflash, they don't exist. Princeton is just that exclusive.
The joke was on me this time. After yet another trouncing of Yale at The Game, Harvard was greeted with the glorious news that Epperly threw a nasty pick at Dartmouth to blow his team’s chance at an undefeated conference season and sole possession of the Ivy title. How’d that feel, Epperly? Fun to share with Harvard, right? I hope you had a blast at your bonfire. Up here in Cambridge we feel no need for a medieval celebration after beating two lesser institutions. I wonder if the butlers made the fires?
And so we arrive at the very-recent past, a high point of my hatred for Princeton. This past weekend, my new dream finally materialized. Brick by brick, four Harvard teams took down the Tigers. From the ice at Hobey Baker to the bleachers at Lavietes, it was the Crimson in the limelight.
Thank you, women’s basketball, for beating Princeton own its own turf for the first time since 2009 as Niveen Rasheed probably wept quietly from the Euro leagues. Thank you, men’s basketball, for dropping our Jersey friends to a measly 0-2 in the Ivies, and rattling them enough to lose to Dartmouth—DARTMOUTH, I tell you—the next night. Congratulations, men’s hockey for snapping your four-game losing streak. And women’s hockey, you stayed classy to hold on for the win. That’s what you get from a top-five-in-the-nation team.
So here it is, Princeton. You’re soft. You’re not our rival…Yale is. Harvard and Yale don't sell Princeton-bashing gear, but I’m sure the Barbour, Kate Spade, and Lululemon stores in the town of Princeton are just stock full of Harvard-flaming paraphernalia. The Game never refers to a face-off with the Tigers. Princeton is on the periphery, no more of a real thorn in our sides than UPenn State or SUNY-Cornell. Get that, Tigers? We don’t really care, and we’re coming for you at Jadwin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After consecutive wins against the Killer Ps, the Harvard men’s basketball team (17-3, 4-0 Ivy) finds itself in a familiar position. For the fourth straight season, the Crimson has won its first four games of conference play, leading the pack after the first quarter of Ancient Eight play as it prepares to take on Brown (11-7, 3-1) and Yale (9-9, 3-1) this weekend at Lavietes Pavilion.
However, as has often been written in these pages, this Harvard team is different. The Crimson is outscoring its opponents by over 20 points a game in conference play—which, if it holds up, would smash the record of the 2009-2010 Cornell Big Red (15.4 point margin of victory) as the standard for modern league dominance.
Coming into the weekend, co-captain Laurent Rivard emphasized that the team is not concerned with history but with whichever team that lies ahead.
“We are in the driver’s seat right now, but we have to take it one game at a time,” Rivard said. “We have two teams coming in that are 3-1, so it is a huge weekend, and we really need to take care of business.”Harvard has won, as coach Tommy Amaker stressed, thanks to its bench and balance. The team scores the second-most points per game among Ivies despite having just one player (junior Wesley Saunders) among the top 15 conference scoring leaders. Five different players average at least nine points a game, and in conference play Harvard is shooting nearly 54 percent from the floor. “I don’t worry about us looking one-dimensional,” Amaker said. “Who knows who it will be Friday night or Saturday night who will be the difference for us?”
The Crimson has taken advantage of a deep bench to spread the ball around. Co-captain Brandyn Curry has averaged 8.9 points a game, while junior reserves Jonah Travis and sophomore Agunwa Okolie both led the team in scoring in separate nonconference games. Freshman Zena Edosomwan has shown signs of development as of late, scoring 10 points against Penn on Saturday.
The team’s abundance of weapons has meant, according to Amaker, that there is no one player the squad looks to for scoring. “We want the go-to guy to be the open guy,” Amaker said. “I learned that years ago following the Celtics…. For me that’s the beauty of a team sport, especially in basketball.” Both strengths will be key for Harvard this weekend against two deep Ivy League squads. Nine different Bulldogs average at least ten minutes a game, and eight different Bears put up at least six points a night.
Harvard’s two opponents will come into Cambridge after sweeping Cornell and Columbia last weekend. Overall, both Yale and Brown have won four of their last five matchups, the lone losses coming against one another.
While the Crimson went 4-0 against the two teams last year, only one of the wins—a 65-47 triumph over the Bears—came in double digits. When the two teams came to Lavietes last year, Harvard twice saw double-digit halftime leads slip away. Against the Bears, a 22-point Harvard lead disappeared in the second half behind a flurry of threes from junior guard Sean McGonagill. The Crimson prevailed in double overtime, 89-82, but McGonagill—the Ivy League’s leading scorer this year—put up 20 points and eight assists.
“We know how hard [Brown] has played us and how challenging our games have been,” Amaker said. “We have played some incredibly entertaining games against Brown and their ability to score has always been something that concerns us. McGonagill is a kid that puts up big numbers. That’s dangerous because he can carry them.”
Against the Bulldogs, Harvard will focus on containing sophomore Justin Sears. The forward is fourth in the league in scoring at 15.3 points a game and gets to the free throw line better than anyone else in the Ancient Eight, averaging over seven free throw attempts a game.
Amaker said, however, that Yale—which has two of the league’s top 10 scorers—is much more than a one-man team.
“We have said this internally: we think they are as deep and talented as anyone in our league,” Amaker said. “They are athletic, they’re big. [Junior Javier] Duren is 6’4”, and he’s the point guard. They are as talented as anyone in our league. They return most of their players and [were] picked to finish third. And I’m sure they looked at it as a slight, and we are going to have our hands full this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of the credit for the Harvard men’s basketball team’s league-seizing weekend sweep, and in particular for Jan. 31’s win over Princeton, has to go to standout junior guard Wesley Saunders. Against the Tigers, Saunders excelled on both ends of the court, leading the Crimson in points, rebounds, assists, and steals.
At this week’s media conference, Saunders’ numbers prompted an interesting comparison to the last Harvard player to record such a stat line: that sacred object of Crimson reverence, Jeremy Lin ’10. ESPN’s Jack McCluskey summed up the debate in an article on Tuesday, noting that Saunders, like Lin during his senior season, is currently in the Ivy League’s top 10 in nine different statistical categories. But unlike Lin, Saunders is given the assignment of guarding the opposition’s best perimeter offensive player in virtually every game Harvard plays, using his speed and length to block driving lanes and disrupt shots.
So, advantage Saunders? Not so fast. Let’s not forget that, before Lin’s arrival in Cambridge, the Crimson, for lack of a better word, sucked. The program had not had a winning season since 2001-2002, when it finished barely over .500 at 14-12. Lin’s supporting cast included freshmen versions of Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey and a guy named Doug. Among Saunders’ teammates are seniors Casey and co-captain, a first team All-Ivy point guard in sophomore Siyani Chambers, and two All-Ivy honorable mentions in co-captain Laurent Rivard and junior Steve Moundou-Missi. The Crimson is an Ivy juggernaut, as opposed to the inexperienced group Lin threw on his back for a third-place Ivy finish in 2009-2010. Teams have much more to worry about now than just one player, which creates more openings for Saunders to exploit than Lin had.
This is not to say that Saunders can’t eventually match Lin’s achievements. He is still a junior and has been one of the best two players in the conference the last two seasons. Like Lin, he is a total outlier athletically in the Ivy League. He has worked every year to fill the holes in his game, especially his jump shot, which has morphed into a reliable weapon. And unlike Lin, he can play a lick of defense. Saunders certainly has the best shot of anyone on Harvard’s team to record meaningful professional minutes—though Saunsanity doesn’t quite have the same ring to it.
DARTMOUTH V. YALE
Well, Dartmouth certainly had some spunk last weekend. The Forest Guardians protected their Hanover stronghold admirably in sweeping Penn and Princeton in a development foreseen by roughly no one. I’m still not sold they can keep it up without injured star Gabas Maldunas, though they do appear to have some better strategies on the court now than the “cower-and-die” approach they adopted in their 30-point loss to Harvard. I’ll give this one to the Big Green, but not with any trace of conviction.Pick: Dartmouth
HARVARD V. BROWN
Somehow, a share of first place will be on the line for the Bears when they travel to Lavietes Pavilion on Friday night. Too often the Ivy League punching bag, Brown has made some big strides over the last couple of years, and, as mentioned above, it wasn’t so long ago that Harvard was a perennial also-ran in the conference, as well. The result will likely be a comfortable win for the Crimson, but not before everyone takes a moment to appreciate the a-changin’ times. You know all sorts of huffy Penn and Princeton alums are outraged by the impropriety of it all. “Howard, I’ll tell you what I’ve heard,” they tell each other breathlessly. “I think these other schools have started recruiting.” And then they pine for the good old days, when you got ahead in this world through hard work and functioning alcoholism.Pick: Harvard
PRINCETON V. COLUMBIA
It turns out we may know less about these teams than we thought. Both Columbia and Princeton flopped pretty heavily on their first weekend road trips of the season, getting swept like so much dust under the rug. This is a tough weekend for Columbia to embark on another challenging road trip; they could very easilycome out of it near the bottom of the league with four conference losses—and right when we thought they might actually be good, too. Maybe Columbia was divinely preordained to never experience any sporting joy. Columbia is the Cleveland of the Ivy League.
Pick: PRINCETON
PENN V. CORNELL
The reports of Cornell’s death may have been greatly exaggerated. After I trumpeted their ineptness from the mountaintop last week, the Ithaca boys proved me wrong by…losing two more games. But they were kind of close! The Big Red took a lead into halftime on the road against Brown, then fell by four the next night at Yale. Leading scorer Nolan Cressler got a little support from his teammates, particularly Devin Cherry, who combined with Cressler to score 48 points against the Bulldogs. And, would you look at that, Cornell moved three whole spots up Ken Pomeroy’s national rankings—all the way to 342nd. I call that progress.
Pick: PENN
DARTMOUTH V. BROWN
Here’s how Brown’s website introduces the bio of second-year head coach and former Bears basketball player Mike Martin: “When Thomas Wolfe wrote, ‘you can never come home again,’ he didn’t have Mike Martin in mind.”
Now, I know the Brown faithful are all a-flutter over the job Martin has done in Providence, but I think they may have overdone it in the gravitas department here. You mean to tell me that Wolfe’s inspiration was something other than the life experiences of a middling college athlete 70 years in the future? I don’t buy it.
And now for an inexhaustive list of things Thomas Wolfe did not have in mind when authoring You Can’t Go Home Again: Superman, LeBron James, Edward Snowden, The Shah, Princess Leia.
Pick: DARTMOUTH
CORNELL AT PRINCETONThe last two non-Harvard Ivy League champions could be battling it out for last place this weekend. Unfortunately for Cornell, this one will be decided by a basketball contest and not a game of Candy Crush, the activity that has been occupying most of the Big Red’s practice time this season. Princeton wins in a rout.Pick: PRINCETON
PENN V. YALE
Some Columbia students filmed what is being termed as a “feminist porno” in a campus library last week. [ALL JOKES REDACTED; EVERY POSSIBLE GROUP IS OFFENDED]
So, yeah, expect Columbia in a wild, physical affair.
Pick: COLUMBIA
HARVARD V. YALE
There’s nothing the Crimson would love more than to give the Bulldogs the “dryer treatment” in Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night. And while the Crimson should take care of business, Yale is no pushover; Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has maintained all season that the Bulldogs are “as talented as anyone in our league,” his own team included. The rangy trio of Javier Duren, Justin Sears, and Armani Cotton could give the Crimson some problems—but Harvard is simply too good, and its home-court advantage too unassailable (19 straight home wins), to drop a game here.
Pick: HARVARD

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a small-ball team that usually makes its big plays on the outside, Friday night’s matchup against Brown was fought and won on the inside.
Going up against arguably the best frontcourt in the Ivy League in sophomore Cedric Kuakumensah and junior Rafael Maia—the top shot blocker and second-leading rebounder, respectively—the Crimson men’s basketball team turned to freshman forward Zena Edosomwan to provide the offensive spark it needed to remain undefeated in the Ancient Eight. Edosomwan did just that, leading his team to a 52-45 over Brown.
Hosting the Bears (12-8, 4-2 Ivy) at Lavietes Pavilion in its lowest-scoring game of the season, Harvard (18-4, 5-1) looked to the bench when its starters couldn’t get the job done. Junior wing Wesley Saunders—the Crimson’s typical top scorer—was held to six points on the night, though he made his presence felt defending the conference’s leading scorer, Brown guard Sean McGonagill.
“If he doesn’t lock in defensively, we don’t win,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “How he played on the offensive end is one thing, but if he doesn’t turn around and get up the floor and do the job he does, then I am not sure we are able to come out with a victory.”
Brown jumped out to its largest lead of the night with six minutes remaining in the first half when forward Leyland King put the Bears up four with a quick midrange jump shot. On the other end, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi converted an easy layup to bring the Crimson within two. Edosomwan proceeded to knock down two free throws to tie the game up, 17-17.
Harvard finished the half on a 10-4 run, with Edosomwan fighting for the last possession and ultimately putting away his own rebound with 12 seconds on the clock. Brown did not make a field goal in the final six minutes of the period, with three of four points coming from guard Norman Hobbie at the line. Edosomwan scored nine of his team-high 12 points in the seven minutes before intermission.
“[Edosomwan] is a hard worker,” Moundou-Missi said. “He is always the last one in the gym…and he has been working on his game. Even though he wasn’t playing at the beginning of the year, he took it upon himself to get better every day.”
The Crimson kept up its energy after the break, jumping out to a 15-point lead within three minutes.
While the Crimson held its lead for the next 10 minutes, the Bears began to crawl back with five minutes to play. Big defensive stops kept Brown from regaining the lead, but the Bears made it a one-possession game with two minutes left on the clock thanks to a pair of free throws from guard Tavon Blackmon. The freshman led Brown with 11 points on the night.
“The key for us winning tonight was our defensive [effort] overall,” Amaker said. “We take a lot of pride in that. That is the first thing we talk about as part of our identity, and I thought that our entire team takes that to heart. We had some breakdowns, but I thought for the full game our kids gave a tremendous effort.”
Harvard caught a break with a minute left to play after a pair of Saunders free throws opened up a five-point gap. McGonagill travelled, giving the Crimson the ball. The Bears came down with the defensive board on the next possession, but Hobbie’s three-point attempt at the other end went long, and Maia picked up a foul battling Moundou-Missi for the rebound. Moundou-Missi hit both free throws with 20 seconds left on the clock and swatted Blackmon’s layup attempt on the Bears’ last possession to secure the win for the Crimson.
Brown outrebounded Harvard, 46-39, but the Crimson capitalized on its second chances more efficiently. In a game in which shots weren’t falling and Harvard tallied its second-lowest shooting mark of the season—just over 32 percent from the field—the home squad held Brown to an even lower success rate. The Bears shot at a 27 percent clip from the field, including 12.5 percent from deep.
“It was just one of those nights,” Saunders said. “Luckily we were able to lock down on defense. I just wanted to stay focused on defense because regardless [of your offensive performance] you can control defense. You can’t always control the shot. Defensively you can always bring energy and try to do the best job you can.”

Happy Friday! Based on some statistical data we’ve compiled through an intensive multi-year research project, our results have shown that Friday is unanimously everyone’s favorite day of the week and also the only day of the week in which students claim their roommates are not grumpy in the morning.

Before you commence your weekend festivities, here are some important events that happened this week so you can make classy small talk at the parties:
1) Sochi 2014: After much controversy, the Winter Olympics finally start today! 
2) U.S. Government Dysfunction: Speaker of the House John Boehner said on Thursday that the House was unlikely to make serious progress on immigration legislation because of a lack of trust between House Republicans and President Obama’s administration.
3) Jay Leno ends his time on the Tonight Show: Let’s all welcome the era of Jimmy Fallon.
4) Protests in Ukraine: People have been camping out in tents in Kiev’s central square for over 75 days to protest Victor Yanukovych’s tenure as President.
5) Earthquake in Indonesia: A 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia on Tuesday, though no tsunami warning was put into effect.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today’s weather will be cool but dry, with a high of 30 degrees and a 0% chance of precipitation. To be honest, we’re sick of this weather and have no more snarky comments to make.

EVENTS: WEEKEND PREVIEW
If you’re a freshman, like us (unfortunately), this year’s Freshman Formal will be taking place at the Seaport Hotel in Boston at 9 p.m. Grab dinner in Annenberg beforehand (it’s catered!) before descending upon the T in all your finery. Pro tip: avoid the coat check.
If the formal doesn’t seem hilarious enough to you, stop by Instant Gratification Players’ comedy show, Monsters and Misfits, taking place in the Loeb Experimental Theater at 7 and 9 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Actually, Monsters and Misfits seems to be a pretty good way to sum up Freshman Formal as well…
The Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society is also having a comedy show called The Black Tie Show tonight at 8 in Sever 113.
The Boston Ballet Company is holding a talk and showing excerpts of their program “Close to Chuck” at the Harvard Dance Center on at 7 p.m.
Thinking of putting your artistic skills to the test? Harvard’s Office for the Arts’ Ceramics Program is having a pottery and sculpture making night at 9 p.m. tonight. There will be free food, music, and shuttle bus service from the Smith Campus Center to the new ceramics studio and back.
There are a ton of athletic events happening on campus today as well. Check out Men’s Wrestling vs. Penn at 6 p.m. at the MAC, Men’s Basketball vs. Brown at 7 p.m., or Men’s Ice Hockey vs. Dartmouth also at 7 p.m. Don’t forget to send some love to our Women’s teams who are playing away this weekend!
