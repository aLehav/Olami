"The Japanese Lover,” the latest addition to a prolific body of work by acclaimed Chilean-American novelist Isabel Allende, reads like its titular namesake: self-aware, gentle, and brimming with forbidden love. As Allende deftly beams the story through the lens of 80-year-old Alma Belasco’s life—focalizing her romantic journey with Japanese gardener and lifelong lover Ichimei Fukuda—it touches upon deeper, universal questions, including the historical injustices of race and class surrounding World War II. While it would be tempting to devolve into a melodramatic treatment of the subject matter, Allende handles such weighty themes with an experienced hand. Her pen’s light touch delivers difficult moments with a quiet resonance that permeates the novel’s nuanced relationships.
In the novel, relationships—romantic and otherwise—are the foundation around which other elements unify. The central romance between Alma and Ichimei is organically recounted by the former in her old age through non-chronological fragments of her memory, unexplained narrative shifts to the past, and short excerpts from Ichimei’s old love letters. While a few transitions between these perspectives feel abrupt and unnatural, most flow smoothly between the present and the 1950s, mediated by common characters, locations, or emotions. The most effective method used to traverse space-time in the text is the fragments of correspondence between the two aged lovers. Ichimei, “an idealist, a dreamer, with a taste for drawing and poetry, more inclined toward meditation than commerce” writes in a way reflective of his nature: Simple and sweet, drifting like a cloud towards a faraway home up above. Chronological jumps notwithstanding, the lyrical passages of memory effectively ground the scattered particles of places, people and events in the narrative of Alma and Ichimei’s romance.
In addition to love, another thematic pillar of the novel is its sweeping historical commentary, primarily accomplished in the novel’s retrospective sections. Allende makes impressive efforts to provide accurate information and establish a realistic historical background for the post-WWII past; at one point, she spends the greater portion of a page outlining Pearl Harbor, chronicling everything from the “severely damaged twenty one ships” to “Americans’ isolationist mentality” to “roundups and arrests” to “dynamite used by small farmers to remove trunks and rocks from their crop fields, which [was] seen as proof of terrorism.” Primarily relayed through the eyes of the Fukuda family, the almost matter-of-fact descriptions of internment camp conditions —“...twelve huts per block, forty-two blocks in total; each of them [with] a canteen, laundry, showers, and latrines....eight thousand evacuees had to live in little more than seven thousand square feet”—are juxtaposed with the deeply emotional images of human relations—“the Fukuda family… wrapped in a pair of blankets they had been given, curled up together on the camp beds to lend each other warmth and comfort.” This careful attention to detail makes concrete a world which is unlikely unfamiliar to readers.
In the hands of a less careful author, the combination of intense romantic narrative and deep-rooted social commentary could easily have proven deadening, its effect either diluted by an overly cautious touch or crushed by a heavy hand. Allende, however, showcases in "The Japanese Lover" the same technical finesse and artistic judgement she demonstrates in her famous work “The House of the Spirits”; her clear style gracefully negotiates between the two different subjects of personal romance and historical injustice. Rather than let one end obstruct the other, Allende creatively uses history as a lens through which to understand the characters’ romantic journeys and vice versa. For example, character relations in the novel are dependent on their historical context: Alma’s first reaction upon seeing Ichimei is to note that he “[looked] nothing like the Chinese she had seen in the illustrations in the Encyclopedia Britannica,” and when the question of marriage arises, Allende fluidly incorporates the reality of social and racial divide between the lovers. Ultimately, Alma rejects Ichimei because of her inability to accept the hardship associated with life within a Japanese community—“She wasn’t going to start a family in a wooden shack with a tin roof and live among gardeners with spades in their hands.” Alma and Ichimei’s relationship is transfigured by Allende’s realistic portrayal of social pressures during this period and their love narrative is made more three-dimensional by the existence of hostile forces. Through this synthesis Allende delivers—with characteristic understated tenderness—the most beautiful observations. “I imagine you running here,” Ichimei says, at one point in the letters. “Sometimes love hurts.” A few words suffice to convey their distance from each other and his yearning.
Departing from the magic realist bent of many of her former works, Allende explores with quiet force the equally human concerns of romance and pluralism with a multifaceted storyline grounded in historical truth. "The Japanese Lover" erects two thematic pillars of love and prejudice to produce a story that strikes a masterful emotional balance. More importantly, the novel crafts characters that are profoundly compelling in their complex struggle to value love despite forces—youth and age, proximity and distance, society and self—beyond their control.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I really think about it, I am seldom honest on social media. I decided to change that this year. Last month, for the first time, I was completely transparent on the Internet and posted on Facebook a central aspect of my life that I had previously kept hidden: my depression.
Even though I felt vulnerable and exposed, being honest and upfront was cathartic. The support I received was overwhelming, and I was inundated with grateful messages from people who had endured similar struggles, but had never spoken out.
Social media personas are inherently biased, which limits them from portraying the truest aspects of people’s lives. When you scroll through your Instagram feed, whose posts pop up? The Athlete? The Musician? The Party-girl? Maybe all of those and more. But is that the entirety of who these people are?
Freshman Fall I sat in my dorm room scrolling through my various news feeds. On Snapchat, I saw high school friends out celebrating; on Instagram, I saw pictures of groups of smiling girls in pristinely decorated dorm rooms with their new best friends; on Facebook, I saw faces I did not recognize posing in a tight bunch with a high school friend I was now miles apart from. My life-long friends had busy new social lives while I sat in my room on a Friday night, reluctantly scrolling through social media. The average person spends 1.72 hours a day on social media. I see most of my friends more regularly on a screen than in face-to-face interactions.
These on-screen encounters coupled with superficial Thanksgiving break conversations led me to believe that my friends were all loving their freshman fall. It was only through subsequent connections and deeper conversations that I realized the truth behind the façade that social media helps to create.
Social media can be isolating. But it’s also a choice: you don’t have to play along with the digital world’s customs. Sure, I’m still going to post pictures that I think I look good in. But now, I’ll do this with the understanding that this is not an accurate representation of the entirety of who I am. Through my experiences over the last month, I’ve realized that social media can also be used as a way to connect with others. So with this in mind, I recently decided I am also going to start sharing other aspects of my life that I am proud of, regardless of whether or not I believe they will get as many “likes.”
A social media platform, called @halfthestory, aims to shed light on people’s personal struggles and the hidden talents, ideas, and beliefs that we can use to connect us on a deeper level.  @halfthestory allows us to share a part of our identity (positive, negative, anything) that is not typically revealed through social media channels. This platform taught me about a friend’s relationship with yoga — something I hadn’t heard about before. Through her social media activities, I never suspected that she was a yogi, but upon reading about this in @halfthestory, I immediately connected her yoga with my interest in meditation which (yep, you guessed it), was spurred by my desire to find solace in my depression. Now we have more frequent and satisfying conversations about the more interesting parts of our lives.
Throughout all of high school and college, I have coached and volunteered for Special Olympics. I had never thought to post an Instagram sharing this aspect of my life. But this weekend, I had a Special Olympics tournament and decided to Instagram some of my team’s cellys (celebrations). A handful of people reached out to me asking about Special Olympics and how they can get involved.
I firmly believe that the aspects that make us unique are what can bond us together and help us form new connections. My peers constantly blow me away. Everyday, I learn about secret talents and passions that are fundamental parts of their lives — talents that are often absent from social media.
Harvard has a diverse student body containing people with distinct personalities and talents. These unique aspects are seldom shown through social media, but are what can lead to the most meaningful connections. So, ask yourself: What would you want people to know about you that you haven’t already shared? Be aware of how you use social media and how it is used by others. Be honest with your friends and yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year I wrote a piece about final clubs with my roommate. In the months following, backlash ensued, most vocally from final club alumni.
I’m not sorry for writing the piece. The piece was intended to provoke conversation and action, and I believe it did. Later that semester, a list of final club members was released, disrupting the frustrating secrecy surrounding current club membership. Everyone assumed that my roommate and I had somehow infiltrated the clubs to get their membership lists, but I can assure you that we don’t have the connections to make that happen. Yes, the op-ed and lists were met with backlash, but this re-ignited a public conversation that has needed to happen since I arrived on campus three years ago­. However, due to the clubs’ lack of transparency and no-press policies, the public discourse surrounding the clubs remains incomplete and one-sided.
Individual members of the clubs reached out to me following the publication of the opinion piece –and the publication of their names. They wondered why I didn’t believe in the value of final clubs. Club members told me about their incredibly positive and affirming experiences in getting to know fellow club members and developing the sorts of long-lasting, deep social bonds that one comes to college to develop. Club members cited the value of accessing networks that they didn’t ever think they would be able to access. Club members told me about how accepting their clubs were, and they asked me why I wasn’t satisfied with their steps toward gender integration—even as they wrote to their graduate boards claiming that Harvard’s administration had “forced [their] hand.”
The most frustrating part of all of this is that I still don’t have a sense of who to talk to about my concerns with final clubs. When final clubs aren’t transparent about membership or punch processes, I’m unable to openly or publicly converse with members of the clubs about my concerns, which only stymies the potential for positive change. This leaves me shouting into the public sphere via The Crimson editorial page.
I want to have nuanced conversations about how to transfer the benefits of club membership to more students. Why is it that club membership is a prerequisite for bonding with an exclusive composite of Harvard men or women, having get-togethers in a mansion on Mount Auburn Street, or accessing a successful and tight-knit alumni network when considering plans for the future? It’s great that final club members are able to take advantage of these positive aspects, but it’s disheartening to me that our campus doesn’t challenge the exclusionary way that these benefits are distributed.
To current members of final clubs, let me be clear: I don’t believe that all members of final clubs are bad people. I don’t accuse or blame you. I believe that by virtue of excluding people on the basis of who they are—what school they went to, who they already know, the way they interact with members of the club—final clubs do some level of harm to the campus community at large. Further, when these clubs answer to graduate boards whose presidents conceptualize college women as liabilities, I become concerned about the ability of these clubs to exist autonomously, without actively harming other students.
This week at lunch, a friend asked me, “Do you think that people would insert final clubs into their ideal Harvard social scene?” My response: “I hope not, but I can’t speak for people in final clubs.” From what I am able to glean as an outsider who has never been offered or granted access, final clubs don’t model healthy or equal social relations—they’re based upon the constructed power dynamics between students choosing and students wanting to be chosen, whether through the punch process or at parties. Those power dynamics are tied to social markers: where you went to high school, whether your parent was in the club, where you’re from, or whether you’re a good “fit” in the club’s social atmosphere.
To be honest, there are  other important things on campus to discuss. I don’t want final clubs to distract from other important campus concerns anymore, but I don’t want to stop pushing my classmates on it. Final clubs are part of a larger conversation about social space on campus, and we need to challenge each other—and the administration—on how to expand social options beyond the club. We need transparency in order to most effectively do this. I’m politely asking clubs to open up about the ways they choose membership—and about who their members are—in order to create a better social scene for all members of the campus community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 20s had flapper dresses that hung instead of clung—the better to celebrate female liberation, my dear.
The 30s had glamorous getups of gold, gaudy glitter—the better to escape the Great Depression woes, my dear.
The hippies of the 60s sported peace signs and flowers; in the 90s, Calvin Klein and Madonna heralded in a decade of shocking, skin-revealing Minimalism.
But the question is, what have we got?
In the game of Name-that-Fashion-Decade, most players stop short at the year 2000. The development of style throughout the twentieth century was largely an exercise in pushing the envelope the contained the rules of dress so that we might better disclose our inner selves through clothes. But with Lady GaGa wearing raw meat on the red carpet and Miley Cyrus running around in pasties and nothing else, it seems like the envelope has burst. What’s left to reveal if we’re already basically naked?
Interestingly enough, my friends that study other types of art—music, fine, and even writing—feel as if their artistic fields are up against a similar conceptual wall. Namely, that it’s hard to shock people anymore.
A concrete example of this can be found in the fine arts, where we’ve already deemed work as “Post-Modern.” It seems like artists are painting themselves into a semantic corner that mirrors a more conceptual one happening in all aesthetic fields. Have we innovated as much as we can? What will we call the 2020s? Post-Post-Post-Modernism?
More importantly what will it look like? There is a tendency to dismissively label the aesthetic of our generation a referential mash-up of the preceding century’s trends. And I can see why. Most garments—from patterned bell-bottoms to crocheted underwear—have been worn before. At this point, virtually any silhouette, fabric, or color combination you put on your body has a rich sartorial history.
But that’s not to say that we millennials don’t have an aesthetic of our own. In fact, I think we have two. These aren’t defined by the form of our clothes, but by their functions.
This all became clear to me one night last week, when I attended a fancy party wearing a pair of dressy heels only to see another girl sporting a pair of sneakers. She looked great—blasé in the best way possible—and not at all out of place despite her classically casual choice in footwear. These days, tricked-out kicks are as commonplace as freshmen in Annenberg.
Herein lies what I’m going to call Trend #1: “When Hyper-Superficiality Desecrates Function.”
The sneakers of today are a far cry from their original predecessors, which were invented in the late 18th century as nothing more than rubber-soled kicks so crude that the left and right shoe looked exactly the same. Initially created with the intent to fabricate a practical, comfortable shoe, sneakers were considered to be distinctly un-fashionable until the mid twentieth century, when the movie “Rebel Without a Cause” featured celebrity-of-the-moment James Dean wearing Ked sneakers outside of their usual sporty context.
Since then, we’ve taken the sneaker-as-dress-shoe and embellished it to death. In true twenty-first century, ultra-consumerist fashion, there exists an entire market of sneakers that are encrusted with Swarovski crystals, made of quality suede, or perched upon platform heels. Celebrities like A$AP Rocky and DJ Khaled own extensive sneaker collections, made up of shoes from designers like Jeremy Scott and Christian Louboutin, who sell their sneaks for thousands of dollars.
In other words, these are purely aesthetic sneakers, so bombastic in their embellishment that they shortchange usefulness for superficiality. The design and construction of most of these shoes render them completely useless for sports.
But at the same time, we’ve got a vastly different Trend #2 operating, which I’m going to call “When Technology Saves the Day.”
The quest to create a perfectly-engineered sneaker started with the Converse All-Star. Resembling the thin-soled Chuck Taylors that are popular today, these were created with professional basketball players in mind. Years later, the University of Oregon’s track coach Bill Bowerman developed a method of pouring rubber onto a waffle iron in order to create light-as-air racing shoes that wouldn’t slow down his runners. Shortly thereafter, he founded Nike.
Since Bowerman’s use of the waffle iron to create shoe soles, medium selection has only become more innovative. Sneakers are designed with infinitesimal differences in support structure, cushioning, and total shoe weight in order to best fit their user’s needs. Some are made of sweat-wicking, breathable fabrics and others, like the Nike Flyknit, function as shoes and socks simultaneously.
With advances in engineering and computer programming, we’ve been able to design sneakers that better protect our bodies and function as incredibly powerful tools for healthy living.
Not to mention, technological advances have allowed us to create sneakers straight out of a science-fiction movie…literally. Just last week, Michael J. Fox of “Back to the Future” fame tried on the world’s first pair of self-lacing sneakers, and the implications of this innovation are immensely exciting. These shoes are engineered to make it easier for people with disabilities  like cerebral palsy to dress themselves without aid.
Though trends these days may be more conceptual than they were last century, our Fashion-by-the-Decade name game need not end. If the twenty-teens are the decade in which we render painful heels obsolete and make awesome fashion less ableist, I’m excited to see what the 2020s will bring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, the nation watched in anticipation as the South Carolina legislature voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from its State House. Nearly four months later, another symbol is being challenged, now at at this University. The Harvard Law School’s seal, derived from the coat of arms of the family of Isaac Royall Jr., a slaveholder, has come under fire from a new student group at the Law School called “Royall Must Fall.” Members of this group argue that the seal must be changed because of the history of slavery it represents. Despite our vigorous support of ending the use of the Confederate battle flag in all instances, we see efforts to change the seal as ultimately misguided.
Making distinctions between which symbols to keep and which to remove is difficult; our opposition to “Royall Must Fall” is not meant as a broad statement that applies generally to all symbols and emblems. When we look at the Confederate flag, we unequivocally see a symbol of hate—it’s the visual representation of a nation whose very existence was predicated upon the idea of preserving slavery and white superiority. When we see the three bushels of wheat that make up the Law School’s seal, we do not see the same hateful legacy.
It is undoubtedly crucial to reflect upon history in order to realize how far society has come since then. Royall’s donation established an institution that now educates students of all races, creeds, and genders in the practice of law that now protects all Americans. When viewed from this perspective, the transformation within the institution is absolutely stunning. The conversation generated by the “Royall Must Fall” movement and its arguments is crucial to continuing this progress.
Continually changing symbols, however, is unnecessary. We live in a society that has become more progressive over time; in retrospect, many historical figures acted in ways we now find repulsive. George Washington himself was a slaveholder from the age of eleven and Martin Luther King Jr. once wrote to a boy who “[felt] about boys the way I ought to feel about girls” assuring him he was “on the right road toward a solution” since he recognized that his “culturally acquired” homosexuality was wrong. Yet there have been no movements to rename Washington, D.C. because its namesake was a slaveholder or to stop memorializing King because of his homophobic views. The examples of these two men shows just how pervasive this issue is: As our society evolves, changing views show the ways in which even our most beloved national heroes have deep flaws. Recognizing these flaws does not necessitate revising history to remove them entirely; rather, it requires a full understanding of the past and a shared commitment by all, both across the country and at Harvard, to move toward a more inclusive future.
The top of the Law School’s seal, like all other seals at Harvard, bears the word veritas—the Latin word for truth. The current seal presents a unique opportunity to reconcile the truth of the atrocities of the past with the Law School’s ongoing fight for justice and equality. Changing the seal takes us further away from recognizing history, a direction we cannot afford to go. Harvard must keep the current seal, but educate community members on its complicated history, never forgetting the dark past it hearkens.

In a discussion at Harvard Divinity School on Thursday night, Greg Glassman, the co-founder of CrossFit, spoke of the intangible, mental, and social benefits that he says his fitness company delivers to customers.
Moderators at Thursday’s event likened the communal environment at CrossFit to the type of community that Americans have historically received from church. They asked Glassman to address the similarities between his fitness company and these religious communities.
Moderator Casper ter Kuile recalled an interview in which Glassman said, “We keep being asked, ‘Are you a cult?’ and after a while I realized, maybe we are.”
Moderator Angela Thurston said CrossFit members enjoy a sense of community that parallels what church provides to regulars. She said the first thing CrossFit regulars do when they move is find a new “box,” or CrossFit gym.
Glassman echoed Thurston’s comments, calling the CrossFit community “tight.” According to Glassman, people often begin CrossFit simply to join a group that will motivate them to work out; ultimately, many find something much deeper and transformative.
“The fitness is the glue that holds everyone together,” Glassman said, “but there’s something even more cohesive, even a stronger glue than the fitness.”
He recounted a story in which a CrossFit member was involved in a serious car crash. Fellow members of her gym then picked her son up from school, according to Glassman, and went to the hospital to support her.
Implicit comparisons to religion continued to pervade the discussion, as Glassman emphasized the mental strength and resilience that CrossFit membership can build.
“The people looking for shortcuts are gone,” Glassman said.
Multiple CrossFit members were in the audience.
Drew Hunter, a two-year CrossFit member who just moved to Boston, was one of the people who sought out a new “box” during the transition. He said he “absolutely” felt a sense of community in his new “box.”
Caren Hunter said she has also enjoyed her experience as a member of CrossFit.
“It was surprising,” she said, adding that CrossFitters are “the most friendly people I’ve met here in Boston.”

A new study indicates that lower carbon dioxide levels are correlated with better cognitive function, according to researchers at the School of Public Health and their collaborators at State University of New York Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University.
According to a press release, the researchers studied the decision-making abilities of 24 participants in a controlled office environment at the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems.
Researchers measured the changes in the participants’ cognitive abilities—such as the ability to pay attention, solve problems, and strategize—as they were exposed to a variety of simulated building conditions, which differed primarily in their levels of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds.
For assistant professor Joseph G. Allen, the motivation behind this study stemmed from his involvement with what he terms as “sick buildings.”
“People's expectations are changing—they no longer want a building that makes them ‘not sick,’” Allen wrote in an email. “Our research is geared toward identifying the factors for optimized indoor environments, health and productivity.”
Another author of the study, professor John D. Spengler, said that this research would emphasize green design not only for environmental reasons but also for reasons relating to labor productivity.
“If I were a building owner or manager or director of a company,” Spengler asked, “why would I not want my people to have the highest performance?”
The study is part of an ongoing project to understand how this experiment, conducted in a controlled space, could be applied to actual environments. The team is investigating buildings across the nation to see if the same conditions yield similar results. Two buildings at Harvard have even been chosen to be part of this project.
According to Piers O. MacNaughton, a doctoral student who also contributed to the study, the hope is that this research will be incorporated into green office building design. One way, he said, would be to use technology that increases ventilation or lowers the amount of contaminants to improve air quality.
Spengler added that he hopes Harvard can be a leader in integrating green renovations into its buildings.

Harvard placed fourth in a ranking of U.S. colleges released by the Economist late last month, coming in several hundred places ahead of peer institutions.
The Economist based the Oct. 29 rankings—the first ever released by the magazine—on “a simple, if debatable, premise: the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much money its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere.”
The rankings use the estimated salary of students with similar characteristics and compares that with the actual salaries of alumni. The ranking placed Harvard fourth, while Yale came in at 1,270th and Princeton was ranked 770th.
To create the rankings, the Economist pulled data from the Obama administration’s recently-created “College Scorecard” website, which aggregates statistics regarding a school’s average cost, graduation rate, and its graduates’ salaries.
Harvard’s Office of Career Services declined to comment on the rankings, and Yale’s Office of Career Strategy did not respond to requests for comment.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said he was unsure how this new system would hold “in a crowded field of metrics.”
Describing the Economist’s findings as “interesting and intriguing” but not necessarily accurate, he suggested that people start looking for a “God Particle” or “one key” to ranking colleges “when you start being too objective.” Lake pointed to the last place ranking of Cooper Union, a highly selective college in Manhattan, as potential evidence of deficiencies in the ranking system.
Comparing this new metric with the status of traditional U.S. News and World Report college rankings, Lake said he “would be surprised if schools postured around this” new report.
Despite myriad criticisms of college rankings in general, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 has previously praised the dissemination of useful information about universities.

With response rates to telephone polls dwindling in the single digits and inherent demographic problems persisting with Internet polling, it may be time to reconsider the central role that polling plays in the American political process, Harvard History professor Jill Lepore argued at the Kennedy School of Government on Thursday.
“American politics is adrift in a sea of polls—this year that sea is deeper than ever before and darker,” Lepore said. “[Donald] Trump is a creature of that sea, but so are we. Turning the press into pollsters has made American political culture Trumpian: frantic, short-sighted, sales-driven, and anti-democratic.”
While response rates to public opinion polls have plummeted from more than 90 percent in the 1930s to the low single digits today, polls are paradoxically affecting American elections more than ever, Lepore said. This summer, the first Republican debate hosted by Fox News averaged the results of five national polls to select the 10 participants in its prime-time debate; the first Democratic debate on CNN had a similar cutoff for participants, requiring a 1 percent polling average in three polls to be invited.
“Many reputable pollsters found this decision unsupportable,” Lepore said, adding that Fox News had used polls conducted more than 460 days before the election.
The decline of traditional forms of polling, however, does not necessarily mean that one needs to turn immediately to data science and new technological methods, according to Lepore. In fact, Lepore argued that more advanced means of conducting surveys may undermine rather than enhance the political system.
“Data science is dazzling, but it can’t solve the biggest problem in public opinion polling, because that problem is neither methodological nor technological—it is in fact political,” Lepore said. “Pollsters rose to prominence in the United States by claiming that measuring public opinion is good for democracy—but what if it’s bad?”
In particular, Lepore challenged the audience to think about the implications of a hypothetical technology that would let members of Congress perfectly measure the opinions of the electorate.
She imagined a scenario in which a member of Congress was about to vote on a piece of legislation they considered critical but which they had learned was unpopular with their constituents, who were preparing to withdraw campaign funds.
“So if I vote against my convictions but in line with my constituents as read by this technological tool, is that democracy?” Lepore asked.
Lepore’s remarks came as part of the 26th Theodore H. White Lecture on Press and Politics organized by the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy. Directly preceding Lepore’s lecture, author and Guardian columnist Gary Younge was presented with the 11th annual David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate Student Council representatives voted Wednesday night to eliminate the option of waiving a student term bill fee that funds the organization and graduate student-run events.
Currently, students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are billed a $25 “Graduate Student Council fee” each year that goes toward funding the GSC’s meetings, as well as conferences and summer research grants. 
GSAS students could waive the fee this year by sending a signed letter to the Council before mid-September, according to the GSAS student handbook. GSC representatives voted mostly in favor of removing that option, with only six voicing opposition votes, and two abstaining.
The approved resolution exempts graduate students who can demonstrate a financial hardship in paying the fee.
During the resolution’s debate period, one representative asked the Council’s leadership to define the circumstances that constitute a financial hardship. In response, Vice President John Gee said students’ financial situations will be examined on an individual basis.
This is not the first time council representatives have discussed limiting the term bill fee waiver. Graduate students who waive the $25 fee are ineligible to receive grant money or participate in “GSC programs and services,” according to the council’s website. In a meeting this October, some representatives complained that there is a lack of enforcement for the rule, according to the council’s public meeting notes.
The College bills undergraduates a similar $75 term bill fee that helps fund the Undergraduate Council. Although previous UC leaders have proposed raising the fee, the $75 figure has remained stagnant for nine years. Undergraduates may waive the charge by submitting a letter to a central accounting office, according to the University Student Financial Services’ website.

Construction will begin on Harvard’s Science Center after this year’s Commencement, turning the Cabot Science Library and surrounding ground floor areas into more open spaces, with renovation scheduled to conclude in summer 2017.
Administrators told faculty about the planned renovation project—then funded by an unnamed donor and on an unknown timeline—in October 2013, but until recently had not offered extensive detail. On Thursday, Harvard released construction plans and said the renovation will be funded by a gift from Penny Pritzker ’81 and designed by architects Mack Scogin and Merrill Elam. Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the size of Pritzker’s gift.
 Among other changes, the 40-year-old library will have its solid walls and windows replaced with glass walls, visually integrating the space with the Greenhouse Cafe and Science Center exterior. The upgraded “commons” area, as described in a press release, will ultimately feature a “mobile discovery bar” for library visitors to try out new technologies, and will also include new group study rooms, media production labs, and a classroom.
During construction, the first floor of Cabot Library will be out of service, according to Dane. Library services and staff will move to the second floor, and Dane said Harvard might start construction in the early mornings or evenings to minimize disruption during the library’s operational hours.
After construction is complete, the Harvard University Information Technology lab will move into the library’s lower level. It is unclear whether, as envisioned earlier last fall, Cabot Library will have up to 80 percent of its print materials moved off-site, though the press release says the space will feature collections in mathematics and the sciences.
Dane said two student focus groups gave “valuable feedback” on the design for the upcoming renovation. The Undergraduate Council nominated two students, Riya Patel ’17 and Mimi Yen ’16, to the focus groups, and a faculty committee was tasked with overseeing the project.
“The feeling was that the science library was a particularly interesting library to use as an innovation hub for the whole library system, in part because, in a lot of fields in the sciences, the print storage functions that are traditional functions that we associate with libraries are increasingly secondary,” Jeffrey T. Schnapp, a Romance Languages and Literatures professor who led the faculty committee, told The Crimson last October. “What you really want a library to do is to be a place where people can be involved in collaborative work.”
The last major renovations to the Science Center came between 2002 and 2004, when 32,000 square feet of space was added to house the Collection of Historical and Scientific Instruments and the History of Science Department.

Norman Foster, a prominent architect with projects on six continents and over 40 years of experience, called for considering the environment in designing architecture at the inaugural Center for Green Buildings and Cities lecture on Thursday night.
In the talk, Foster drew upon his life experiences, his varied projects, and ideas about the impact of architecture on the environment to illustrate sustainable design technique. His creations include structures for urban design from London’s Trafalgar square to Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City, museums like Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts and London’s British Museum, airports in Beijing and Hong Kong, and government buildings such as the New German Parliament in Berlin.
Foster said he treated each individual project as an opportunity to pioneer in sustainable architecture, what he called a growing field.
“We’ve moved on to a new kind of architecture in which we account for the environment as much as we do its functional intent,” he said. “Architecture allows for expression in regards to the landscape and its connection to the surrounding world.”
Within each project, Foster elaborated on the methods he used in preliminary design—carefully taking into account a variety of factors from urban sustainability, to local culture, to function and purpose. Revolutionary design can be surprisingly similar to something familiar and traditional, he said.
“I think it was insightful how he broke down the projects—details of the facade, or a video of the air flow through the building—explaining to us what it was that defined the architecture itself," said Belle Suppapanya, who studied design at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.
In addition, Foster described contemporary methods by which architecture could be more fully incorporated into a green society.
“Given the scale, the lightness, the quality of a building, our infrastructure is inseparable from the sustainability of cities," says Foster, "If we just look at the carbon footprints of those different kinds of cities, we see that many cities have the same population but have disproportionately different carbon footprints."
Foster also recognized the power of advocacy in raising awareness among politicians.
“Architects who have moved into the political domain and are able to be influential in their communities have paved the way for communities to become greener,” Foster said.
Foster cited the long-term importance of architectural sustainability, within larger demographics like cities. In cases such as bridges, smart architecture can improve a variety of standards such as traffic flow, daily visitations, commerce, and cultural integration.

UPDATED: November 10, 2015, at 4:44 p.m.
A new pilot program from the U.S. Department of Education will make $20 million in Pell Grants available for high school students dually enrolled in college courses.
The program could affect nearly 10,000 low-income high school students.
The pilot is experimental “for institutions that already have an arrangement that permits public secondary school students to enroll in a title-IV eligible postsecondary program,” according to Carol M. Stuckey, the executive director of strategic growth initiatives at Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education.
The Harvard Extension School, which offers more than 700 courses to non-traditional students, does not currently have such an arrangement, according to Stuckey. But some students and teaching staff familiar with the Extension School’s offerings praised its ability to prepare high school students for college academics.
Robert Winters, a multivariable calculus lecturer at the Extension School, said the high school students he has taught there often do well with the college-level material that dual enrollment allows them to access.
“Most of the high school students are actually the best and brightest,” Winters said. “It’s a privilege to be able to teach students like that.”
He added that the new pilot program can only help make an affordable college education more accessible for students.
Mayukha Karnam ’19, who took multivariable calculus at the Extension School before enrolling at the College, said dual enrollment gave her and other high school students an opportunity to engage with college material in a way that they could not do in their high school courses.
Echoing Karnam’s sentiment, Daniel M. Kim ’19, who enrolled in the same course, said, “It did a good job not only introducing me to the topic, but also getting me ready for that type of rigor…. It’s a good way to be introduced to college itself. What you’re getting from it is a lot more than just the education.”
Graduate School of Education professor S. Paul Reville said he thinks the new federal program is a great opportunity, particularly for low-income students who would not have access to dual enrollment otherwise.
“Relatively few students get to participate in this kind of program,” he said. “The chief obstacle is finances.”
According to Reville, dual enrollment programs across the U.S. have generally been successful. He said they have been effective in helping students get ready for college and maintaining students’ interest in completing high school.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 10, 2015
An earlier version of this article and its headline incorrectly suggested that the new U.S. Department of Education pilot Pell Grant extension program could affect the Harvard Extension School. While some high school students are dually enrolled there, the school is not a participant in the pilot program.

Companies can make a large impact on the environment by focusing their efforts on sustainable practices, M. Sanjayan, a conservation scientist and the host of the PBS series "Earth: A New Wild," told a packed Geological Lecture Hall on Thursday night.
The lecture, titled “How Nature Can Save Us,” focused on how important nature is to humans. It was organized by the Harvard Museum of Natural History and the Harvard College Conservation Society in their first collaboration.
Sanjayan, who is also executive vice president of Conservation International, said his group has been working with Starbucks for the past 15 years in an effort to sustainably source 100 percent of the company’s coffee.
Fifteen years ago when Conservation International first started working with Starbucks, only about 10 percent of the company's entire supply chain was sustainably produced. Now, Sanjayan said, that number is 100 percent.
“For them, sustainability equals availability. In a world of seven billion people, if you want to be a global company, you really better think about where your coffee comes from, you better think about where your water comes from, you better think about where the pollution goes,” Sanjayan said. “Because eventually you’re going to get caught up in it.”
Later in his speech, Sanjayan said diversity is important in the field of conservation in order to provide role models to the next generation of environmentalists.
“The messenger is also as important as the message. And sometimes in science and in conservation for sure, we forget. And we forget that much to our peril,” he said.
After the event, Sanjayan said his most important piece of advice to young people hoping to get involved in conservation would be to act now.
“Don’t sit this one out. You’ve got 20 years to make a difference,” he said. “Make it count.”
During the event, Sanjayan said, “Your generation is an amazing generation. Because you guys have the chance to know what’s coming in the future and still have time to do something about it.”
Attendees said they enjoyed the presentation. “I thought it was fantastic,” said Paula S. Tallman, a post doctoral fellow at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.

Two Harvard Law School organizations debated gun rights and regulations at a Colloquium on Gun Control this Thursday night. The Federalist Society, a conservative, moderate, and libertarian group, argued for the preeminence of the Second Amendment in granting citizens the right to bear arms, while the American Constitution Society, a progressive organization, contended that guns’ detriments outweigh their benefits.
Caleb C. Wolanek, the debate chair for the Federalist Society, began the conversation by stating the importance of respecting the rights of any American who chooses to own a gun. He argued that the impracticality of banning guns, as well as a citizen’s right to self-defense, is enough to warrant the possession of guns.
“In many cases, police protection is not enough,” Wolanek said. “Serious incidents can happen in a matter of seconds. Self-defense is an entirely legitimate reason to own a gun.”
Kassi Yukevich, representing the American Constitution Society, argued that America’s lack of effective gun laws have contributed to many tragedies throughout the United States.
“There have been 156 school shootings in America, an average of nearly 1 per week since November of 2013,” Yukevich said. “Over 70 percent of the time, at least one person is injured or killed.”
Yukevich pointed to the higher incidence of gun violence in the United States compared to other countries in the developed world. Many loopholes in firearm sales and access exist in the U.S., she said.
“Firearms sold at gun shows, between private citizens at garage sales, family to family transfers, aren’t regulated by even the minor background check rules in place,” Yukevich said.
Joshua A. Esses, president of the Federalist Society, said that America should not permanently restrict those who have committed crimes from owning guns.
“I might be okay with temporary restrictions until the time they have demonstrated they are no longer at risk for those crimes, but we should not categorically take away a right from a person just because of past actions,” Esses said.
Other students questioned if certain types of guns should be banned entirely, citing a law in Australia that banned semi-automatic and automatic guns, which was followed by a 59 percent decrease in homicide by firearm.
Dorothy Lou “Thea” Sebastian ’08, director of community engagement for the Constitution Society, added that while it is important to make stricter laws in the future, no single reform can fix these problems by itself.

The Harvard football team stayed undefeated on the season by knocking off previously-unbeaten Dartmouth, while the Denver Broncos did the same to the Green Bay Packers two days later (albeit in a much calmer manner). The University of Miami tossed a million laterals in one play, while Drew Brees threw for about the same number of touchdowns. And at some point during the first quarter, the 49ers led the Rams by a score of 3-2.
The end of October has come and gone, and despite the two NFC West teams trying to tell you otherwise, football season is in full swing.
That’s not to say that all else has come to a screeching halt, though, in favor of the pigskin. Lack of progress only applies to psets and essays unfortunate enough to be left to Sunday.
Instead, Harvard athletes of all sports are just starting to light up the ever-important Twitterverse, and that’s why we’re bringing you the top tweets of the week, handpicked just for you.
“Would love to see statistics on Halloween uber use. More requests at night or morning after?”
Oh, I almost forgot. Hope you all had a happy Halloween.
5. Jake Olson, defensive end
“Post-pubescent JB > Pre-pubescent JB”
My first thought was Jose Bautista, but that can’t be right.
Justin Bieber? Nah, that wouldn’t make sense either.
4. Briana Mastel, women’s ice hockey defenseman
“when you take a study break and see that Hocus Pocus is on….. #halloweenclassic #doihavetostudy?”
#technicallynotreally.
3. Weisner Perez, men’s basketball forward
“Just met @Dlee042 of the Boston Celtics casually walking around Harvard>>>> #welcome”
The number of cool and/or famous people you’d randomly run into at Harvard is way too high.
2. Katie Russ, women’s swimming and diving
“When ur essay is so fire ur laptop actually bursts into flame”
Hey, my laptop’s still fine.
…damn.
1. Gabby Sims, women’s swimming and diving
“Just got told by a stranger with a sign that judgment is coming for me…….and here I was thinking I was doing so well! #UghMondays #ratz”
The best part is that she tweeted this on a Thursday.
That’s it for this week’s most memorable tweets!

With any eye towards capturing an Ivy League title for the second year in a row, the Harvard Women’s Volleyball team heads into its final homestand of the season with two critical conference games on its slate.
Although the Crimson (11-9, 7-3 Ivy) is sitting atop the Ancient Eight table for the time being, the squad is in a precarious position. With rivals Dartmouth, Yale, and Princeton all just one game behind Harvard in conference play with identical 6-4 league records, the Crimson’s cushion at the top is minimal. Each of the teams in the top half of the division has a shot to claim the conference championship over the next two weekends.
Coming off of a three game sweep at the hands of one of those other title contenders in the Tigers this past Saturday, Harvard looks to shake off any lingering disappointment and develop a killer edge moving forward.
“We needed to come in extremely focused and make sure we were ready to bounce back this week,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “That mentality is just going to carry out through the week.”
The Crimson kicks off the weekend in a Friday night matchup against Cornell (6-14, 2-8) at the Malkin Athletic Center. Although the Big Red have trudged through the season with many contested league losses, the Ithaca contingent seems to have just come to life. Much of this adjustment can be attributed the electric play freshman outside hitter Carla Sganderlla, who, in her past two games alone, has recorded 42 kills and 36 digs.
After Cornell took Harvard to five sets in a loss earlier in the season, it is hoping that the recent stout play from its young players, like Sganderlla, can help the team finish the deal this time around. The Crimson understands that each game going forward will be hotly contested.
“Cornell is a fairly young team, and they really know how to be scrappy and fight until the end,” said sophomore outside hitter Paige Kebe. “They have consistently taken teams to five games, which shows us that we will have to fight for every point and out-hustle them.”
Harvard will play its last game of the season in Cambridge against Columbia (7-12, 5-5), to whom the Crimson previously lost in mid-October in a four-setter. In that Lions’ win, senior middle hitter Katarina Jovicic led the charge against Harvard on both ends of the floor en-route to tallying 10 kills and a career-high 4 solo blocks.
Jovicic, currently reigning as Ivy League Co-Player of the Week after another solid performance in her matches this past weekend, looks to continue her previous success against the Crimson with plodding, meticulous play.
This methodical pace of Columbia’s attack gave Harvard fits the first time around as it clashed with the Crimson’s preferred up-tempo style.
“Columbia has been tough for us in the past because one of our strengths is our quick tempo, and Columbia's offense is not quite as fast which definitely caught us off guard last time around,” Kebe said.
Harvard will look to adjust to Columbia’s style of play this time around in order to make the most of its second chance against the Lions. The veteran leaders on the team will be pivotal in accomplishing such a feat. Although not a captain nominally, senior libero Sindhu Vegesena offers four years of experience off of which younger players have an opportunity to grow.
“Sindhu … is constantly an emotional rock, which is extremely important for our team,” Holte said. “She always reminds us [of] our end goal in sight, and really knows how to inspire and motivate us. But what I think is amazing is that she couples that with her physical skill and her prowess on the court.”

When sophomore Stone Hart swatted away a potential game-winning Dartmouth field goal to secure a Harvard victory last Friday night, Crimson football players stormed the field in a combination of frenzied jubilation and utter relief.
In the locker room, Harvard coach Tim Murphy leapt headfirst onto the heads and shoulders of a mob of shouting Crimson players.
In the postgame press conference, captain Matt Koran said the team was “blessed with a miracle tonight.” Had the game gone the other way, senior linebacker Jacob Lindsey admitted that “we all would have been crushed.”
The showdown between the two undefeated squads had a decisive feel to it. For many, the contest represented a de facto Ivy League title game. Picked to finish first and second in the conference, Harvard and Dartmouth had rolled over most of their respective competition in 2015.
But the reality is that the Friday night battle was not a championship game. Three more tilts stand between the Crimson and an Ancient Eight title. Three more contests for a chance at a second consecutive undefeated season.
The final stretch starts with Columbia. When Harvard (7-0, 4-0) kicks off on Saturday afternoon in New York, the team will have scored 148 straight unanswered points against the Lions (2-5, 1-3). With this history in mind, and with second-place Penn next on the schedule, it may be tempting to peak ahead to a more meaningful matchup in week nine.
But this Columbia team is not like all others. Two weeks ago, the Lions gave Dartmouth a real scare and fought to a 13-9 loss. Last Saturday, Columbia pulled out a 17-7 victory over Yale in New Haven, the program’s first Ivy League win since 2012.
Traditionally the Ancient Eight cellar-dwellers, the Lions seem to have found a new sense of fight.
“When you have a team that’s struggled mightily for such a long time, it’s amazing how you can go from the bottom of the mountain to the top so quickly,” Murphy said. “From an emotional standpoint, the same thing can happen. You can become believers very quickly.”
Some of this may be attributed to a change at the top. Longtime Penn coach Al Bagnoli, who ranks second all-time with 113 Ivy wins, took over the Columbia program in February.
“I feel like there’s a different atmosphere with coach Bagnoli there,” said senior wide receiver Seitu Smith. “They’re a little tougher, a little more sound in their technique.”
But chalking up the team’s apparent newfound competitiveness to coaching risks belittling the strides that players have made on the field. The Lions boast the third-best scoring defense in the Ivy League and rank first in pass defense, surrendering just 201 yards per game to opposing quarterbacks.
Junior linebacker Keith Brady has recorded a team-high 39 tackles. In the trenches, senior Hunter Little leads Columbia with four sacks on the year, more than any individual Crimson defender.
In 12 quarters against offenses from Dartmouth, Yale, and Princeton offenses, the Lions’ defense surrendered just two touchdowns. This feat would have seemed impossible a year ago.
“They have become, really overnight, a really, really good defense,” Murphy said. “It’s not bells and whistles, it’s not mirages, it’s not x’s and o’s, although they’re extremely well coached. Their front seven is really legit.”
“Last year’s Columbia is definitely not the same as this Columbia,” added senior defensive back Asante Gibson.
While the defense has turned in some commendable performances, the Columbia offense has failed to flip the script of previous seasons through seven games.
Quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg has thrown for just three touchdowns this season; Harvard senior Scott Hosch has tossed 14. The Lions are averaging 113 yards of team rushing per outing; Crimson senior Paul Stanton posts nearly 100 yards per game on his own. Columbia averages 267 yards of weekly total offense; a typical day of work for Harvard consists of 489 yards.
Suffice to say that squaring off against the staunch Harvard defense, which ranks first in the FCS with 8.6 points allowed per game, is not a matchup that bodes well for Columbia.
It’s rare for the Crimson, winners of 21 straight, to suit up against a Columbia team that has a one-game winning streak. Harvard’s mission on Saturday is to make sure that streak doesn’t double.
“[Columbia thinks] if they can beat Yale they can play with Harvard,” Smith said. “But we’re going to show them that’s not the case.”

Around the same time the Harvard football team lost their last game, Lorde had just released her first single “Royals”, The Boston Red Sox were in the middle of winning their third World Series Title in 10 years, New Jersey had just become the 14th state to legalize same-sex marriage, and I was still a junior in high school.
Things have changed. Lorde is now an iconic pop sensation, hanging out with the likes of Taylor Swift. The Red Sox have finished last in the American League East two years in a row. Everyone can marry whomever they want, and I’m living 1,500 miles away from my hometown. The one thing that hasn’t changed, though, is the number to the right of the dash in the Crimson’s record.
Since October 26th, 2013, the Crimson hasn’t lost a game. They are currently riding a 21-game win streak. They were the only undefeated Division I program in the country last year, going 10-0 and winning the Ivy League.
The last loss came to Princeton at home on October 26th, 2013, losing a 51-48 shootout in triple overtime. At the time, Harvard was riding a six-game winning streak on top of being undefeated in 15 straight home games.
The game was highlighted by a combined 10 passing touchdowns, with four from Harvard quarterback Conner Hempel and six from Princeton quarterback Quinn Epperly. Then-sophomore running back Paul Stanton, Jr., ran for 91 yards and two scores on his way to a 936 yard campaign. Stanton is on pace to run for 970 yards this season.
Even with the loss, the Crimson won their second Ancient Eight championship in three years in 2013–sharing it with the Tigers. Since then, Harvard has one of the longest winning streaks in all of college football.

As some teams near the end of their seasons and others look to start with a bang, this weekend at Harvard will have a host of worthwhile games to follow.
Men’s Swimming and Diving versus Bryant
In its season-opener this Friday at Blodgett Pool, Harvard will take on Bryant for the first time ever in a regular season dual.
Harvard is a historically strong team that has never finished lower than second in the Ivy League conference. Returners include sophomore divers Bobby Ross and David Pfeifer, both of whom qualified for the 3-meter diving final last season. Junior Jack Manchester also returns as a formidable force in the backstroke events, having competed in the NCAA Championships last year and currently holding the conference record for the 200 backstroke.
The Bulldogs (4-1) have already competed in five meets this season, and are coming off a win over Iona. This meet will be one of four at home this year, and the only one this semester.
Women’s Volleyball versus Cornell and Columbia 
For the last time this season, the Crimson will take to the familiar Malkin Athletic Center court in its quest for the Ivy League title this weekend. The Harvard squad (11-9, 7-3 Ivy) will look to defend its recently earned standing as first place in the conference against Cornell on Friday and Columbia on Saturday.
Both opponents are coming off strong victories. Last week, the Big Red came back 3-2 to beat Brown, with three players recording double-digits in kills, while the Lions beat Yale for the first time in 14 years. With only four games left in the season, every match counts.
In honor of the team’s last home games, the Crimson will recognize its four seniors, Caroline Holte, Hannah Schmidt, Sindhu Vegesena, and Kathleen Wallace. The Class of 2016 has left an impressive mark on the problem with a record of 35-17 in conference and 33-13 on its home court so far.
Men’s Ice Hockey versus Yale and Brown 
The last time Harvard (2-0) faced Yale and Brown was in the last season’s ECAC playoffs. The Crimson came out with two victories, sweeping Brown 6-2, 4-3 in the opening round and taking down Yale in double overtime in the quarterfinals.
This weekend, Harvard will defend its four-game winning streak on its home rink. After capturing the championship of the Capital City Classic in New Jersey last weekend, an undefeated Bulldogs team (2-0) will look to avenge last year’s loss on Friday. The Crimson will then take on the Bears (0-1) on Saturday.

Ladies and gentleman, we live in a new era of Ivy League football.
When we last took stock of the Ancient Eight, a green-and-crimson striped question mark inhabited first place.
But Harvard and Dartmouth settled their differences this past Saturday in a mind-bending, take-the-red-pill, there-is-no-spoon, is-he-actually-dreaming 14-13 win for the Crimson. Now the Big Green has fallen to second, giving needed definition to the title race.
To all those with high-blood pressure: relax. Somehow, despite persistent warnings from Harvard coach Tim Murphy that the preseason is over, that it was over several weeks ago, and that it was never coming back, preseason action returns this week as the Crimson plays Columbia, and the Big Green plays Cornell.
Competition lurks in netherworld matchups involving teams other than Harvard and Dartmouth, but these games involve teams other than Harvard and Dartmouth.
In short, it’s a vacation weekend. Find a seat, crack a beer, and watch responsibily.
HARVARD AT COLUMBIA
For years and years, the annual Harvard-Columbia matchup has been the equivalent of a Lil B music video: unwatchable, incomprehensible, and more than a little perverse.
This year is different. For starters the Lions have actually won—not just once but twice! Even the team’s most recent loss, a 13-9 squeaker to Dartmouth, indicated real progress.
Let’s all take a moment, then, to appreciate the charity work of Lions coach Al Bagnoli. Bless the man’s heart. I don’t know what it takes to get canonized in 2015, but coming out of retirement to coach Columbia ranks right up there.
However, neither divine intervention nor the decision to start kicker Kenny Smart at linebacker can knock Harvard from its post as overwhelming favorite. Heck, if the Crimson was only allowed to score off blocked punts, I’d still choose the team as 7-0 winner. (This is an official prediction, by the way: Harvard will score a special-teams touchdown.)
As loath as I am to trust conventional wisdom, the truth is that the mob is often right. Just ask Lions quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg, who promises to spend his Saturday dodging groups of Crimson jerseys.
Final verdict? Not quite a Lil B video, but not far off.
Prediction: Harvard 31, Columbia 7
CORNELL AT DARTMOUTH
Check your AP U.S. History book, kids—there’s a reason that people call western New York the Burned-Over District.
Throughout the 1800s, dozens of religious revivals tore through the countryside, enflaming small towns and large farms. It was like the Fast and the Furious franchise except neither cars nor Dwayne Johnson existed.
Well sinners and Cornell fans beware! This Saturday the Third Great Awakening is upon us.
Instead of the lonely wilderness of western New York, this one will take root in the lonely wilderness of western New Hampshire, where Dartmouth looks to inflict its holy wrath upon the Big Red.
Nay, not even star running back Luke Hagy can save Cornell. On Saturday the Big Green will roll through the field like thunder, charged with vengeance after last weekend’s loss to Harvard.
No third-string linebacker will be spared! Surely the very few Big Red spectators will wail and gnash their teeth as quarterback Dalyn Williams fires righteous passes into the end zone.
Yes, the day of justice is near, and the Big Red rightfully cowers in its presence.
Then again it’s tough to say what’s worse, eternal damnation or a bus ride back to Ithaca.
Prediction: Dartmouth 45, Cornell 3
PRINCETON AT PENN
The Killer P’s! At noon! With third place on the line!
The headlines practically write themselves, but in case you need further convincing, consider this scheduling fact: on the second-to-last weekend, the Quakers play the Crimson, and the Tigers play the Big Green.
Either of these games could go down to the wire, which means that this year’s Princeton-Penn matchup is—drumroll please—a competition between semi-relevant teams who could become more relevant by beating the real contenders.
To be fair, I’m selling the Quakers short. Penn quarterback Alek Torgersen has lived up to his Nordic heritage, marauding through conference play for 10 touchdowns and no interceptions. Meanwhile the Tigers have conceded 38-plus points in three of their last four games.
Helmets off to the Viking and his crew—the Quakers will get the win.
Prediction: Penn 28, Princeton 24
BROWN AT YALE
Heat waves bring increased crime.
That’s the hidden explanation behind why ice cream trucks correlate with violent crime, and it’s also a fact. As much as you despise the winter, you can take solace in the fact that you’re statistically less likely to get mugged as the temperature cools off.
On an unrelated note, Yale has scheduled most of its home games for the second half of the season, with three of its last four contests coming in New Haven.
While I’m on the topic of petty theft, I might as well make my prediction: Brown will steal this game, and the result won’t matter.
With conference records of 2-2 and 1-3 respectively, the Bears and the Bulldogs don’t have much to fight for beyond the title of second-ugliest New England city with a population under 200,000.
But fight they will, and Brown’s senior quarterback Marcus Fuller promises to cause game-long trouble for Yale’s young defense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What’s wrong with me?”
Two years ago, Colin Blackwell could not help but ponder the question. Plagued by lingering concussion symptoms after suffering two such injuries just four months apart during his sophomore season, the young forward was forced to leave not only the ice but also the classroom.
Blackwell missed the entirety of the Harvard men’s hockey team’s 2013-2014 season, and a setback in his first game back the following year cast uncertainty over whether or not ESPN Boston’s first-ever “Mr. Hockey” designee would ever return to form.
That uncertainty vanished four months later, however, when Blackwell returned for the Crimson’s playoff run. The North Andover, Mass., native netted goals one after another at the ECAC tournament, finishing with five in seven games, including an empty-netter to clinch Harvard’s first title in nine years against Clarkson.
But after the Crimson suffered a first-round exit at the hands of Nebraska-Omaha in the NCAA tournament, a different kind of uncertainty resurfaced: not whether or not Blackwell would return to form, but whether or not he would return to Harvard.
Equipped with his cap, his gown, and a dark black pair of sunglasses, Blackwell took his seat at Harvard’s Commencement exercises in May, right alongside thousands of classmates preparing for what lies beyond Cambridge.
But Blackwell knew he had unfinished business to take care of. With one semester of eligibility remaining, the St. John’s Prep grad had expected to return to school and the ice all along, likely during the spring semester.
“In my heart, I wanted to be here for the long run and be here for the most important games,” Blackwell said Wednesday. “There’s more games in the second half of the year. You’ve got some of the most important ones [and] playoffs.”
After it was reported in September that Blackwell would be back for at least a semester, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 noted that the team was “excited to have him back.”
“He certainly was a shot in the arm for us when he was healthy at the end of the season,” Donato said. “It is exciting moving forward to have a healthy Colin Blackwell around.”
After working with both Harvard’s Compliance Office and the NCAA over the course of the offseason, Blackwell was also able to obtain a second semester of eligibility prior to the Crimson’s season opener, clearing the now-fifth-year senior to play through the entirety of the 2015-2016 season.
“There were a lot of question marks leading up until now, so to get those out of the way, that’s definitely huge,” Blackwell said. “For the first time in a while...I can finally know I’ll be playing, and stuff along those lines relieves the monkey off your back.”
Despite missing offseason captains’ practices while awaiting a decision, Blackwell did not miss a beat in Harvard’s opening game in Hanover, N.H. Skating on the second line with junior Sean Malone and rookie Ryan Donato, the veteran rocketed a wrister from the bottom of the left circle past Dartmouth goaltender Devin Buffalo for his first goal of the season—one of seven on the night for the Crimson.
One night later, Blackwell was at it again, assisting on junior Victor Newell’s eventual game-winning score and linemate Ryan Donato’s first collegiate goal in another victory over the Big Green. Blackwell finished at a team-high plus-four over the weekend.
“This team this year has probably got to be one of the deepest forward groups I’ve seen in awhile, especially since I’ve been here,” Blackwell said. “In the first two games...it wasn’t just line one, it was line one through four, the defense were chipping in, and I think that’s kind of going to be the beauty of our team this year.”
Including the opening weekend, Blackwell has recorded 14 goals and 28 assists in 68 games over the course of his Harvard career. But given the talent now skating around him, the fifth-year senior could be poised for his best season yet.
A successful senior campaign could provide the second-liner with a legitimate shot at the pros—a career Blackwell says he’d love to pursue. After missing the last two years of San Jose development camp, the Sharks’ draft selection returned this summer, where he says he got a “taste of what being a professional athlete is all about.”
Blackwell says his latest development camp experience has helped him with his preparation at Harvard. But with the summer now behind him, Blackwell has turned his focus back to what matters most.
“Not everyone gets a fifth chance at the Beanpot,” he says. “So I’m pretty excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There aren’t many books written about second place, runner-ups, or silver medals.
As Harvard women’s ice hockey defenseman and co-captain Michelle Picard skated off the ice of the Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi, with Team Canada celebrating a game-winning overtime goal right behind her, she certainly was not thinking about the incredible achievement that winning an Olympic silver medal should be considered.
“We train way too hard to come in second, and that’s not the goal,” Picard said. “We always train to win.”
After being part of an airtight American defense that shut out Team Canada out for nearly 57 minutes, Picard, who took a year off from playing at Harvard to train with the United States Olympic women’s ice hockey team, saw the team’s lead evaporate in the final three minutes of regulation before Canada clinched the 3-2 win in overtime.
Despite the loss, Picard has chosen to focus on the excitement of the experience and the lessons she learned from playing at the highest level of women’s ice hockey.
“That game was what we had wanted and prepared for for years leading up to it,” Picard said. “To finally be there was amazing, exciting, but we knew we had a job to do. The fans were great and loud and there was a lot of energy in the building…. It was intense, and a blast to play in. The game didn’t end how we wanted, but the experience is one I’ll never forget.”
Picard, a graduate of The Noble and Greenough School, joined defenseman Josephine Pucci ’15, forward Lindsey Fry ’15, and coach Katey Stone in Sochi. The quartet took the year off from the Crimson to don the red, white, and blue, a feeling that Picard first experienced in the summer of 2010, her first call-up to the national team.
“There was definitely a lot of excitement, a lot of nerves, and it was a whirlwind experience,” Picard said. “My parents were really proud, really happy, and they made plans to go out to Calgary to watch. It was all very new, very exciting; I’d always wanted to play for the national team, that was a dream of mine since I was a little girl…. Wearing a jersey with your country, your colors, is all very exciting.”
Just months later, Picard tasted her first success at the international level, captaining the USA women’s Under-18 team to a gold medal in the 2011 IIHF Women’s World Championship. She followed up that successful spring with call-ups to consecutive senior world championships, grabbing silver in 2012 before earning gold in 2013.
At the same time, Picard was playing out her freshman and sophomore years at Harvard under Stone, the winningest coach in Division I women’s ice hockey history. The Crimson made progress throughout her first two seasons, qualifying for the NCAA tournament and finishing second in the ECAC tournament in 2013, Picard’s sophomore campaign. Those tournament games also represented the Taunton, Mass., native’s final chance to impress before the preliminary rosters for the 2014 Winter Olympics would be announced.
“When I’m playing with the Harvard team, we’re going for a national championships,” Picard said. “It didn’t happen, but the focus when I’m wearing the Harvard jersey is playing the best I can for the team…. You know the Olympics are coming up, the cuts are coming, but it’s almost too hard to think about that, since it’s too big, too far away. It’s easier for me to focus on the task at hand and know that that’s the best preparation for the path ahead.”
Picard was particularly impressive as a sophomore, working as a first-pairing defenseman and getting more involved offensively. She registered four goals and 13 assists, finishing 10th among ECAC defenseman in assists and earning All-Ivy honorable mention.
After losing to Boston College in the NCAA tournament quarterfinals, there was no time for Picard to sulk. After spending the summer at the world championships, she was named to the roster for the 2014 Winter Olympics, meaning she would have to forgo a year of college to train for the games.
“My dream since I was eight years old was to win the gold medal at the Olympics,” Picard said. “To get a chance to make that come true had me so excited. My teammates at Harvard were so supportive and so happy for me. I was sad to be missing out with the group of girls that I’d trained so hard with. But knowing that I was going to be able to come back, play out my final two seasons, I think that’s what made it easier.”
After her two weeks in Sochi and a spring full of recovery and travel, Picard began ramping up for her return to Harvard hockey in the summer of 2014. The program had not missed a beat despite the absence of four key figures, finishing second in the ECAC and qualifying for the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive season.
Despite being a junior, Picard was named co-captain before the start of the season. Her experience as the gold medal-winning captain of the U-18 team meant that this was not her first time leading such a competitive group, giving the team confidence in her abilities.
“As a leader of the team, I feel a responsibility to pass on the Harvard tradition,” Picard said. “Wearing the Harvard jersey means something, so it’s about making sure the younger players get that as quickly as possible. I also want to play my best to give the team the best opportunity to win.”
The return of Picard and her fellow Olympians helped take the Crimson to new heights during the 2014-2015 season. After a sluggish start, Harvard won 10 regular season games in a row on its way to a share of the ECAC regular season title, upsetting then-No. 1 Boston College on the way. With Picard playing standout defense and providing four assists, the Crimson steamrolled through the ECAC tournament, securing the league-tournament double championship for the first time since 2008.
The NCAA tournament followed, where Harvard routed Quinnipiac, 5-0, before overcoming rival Boston College, 2-1, in the semifinals. Then, an all-too-familiar storyline for the 22-year old Picard: on the cusp of greatness, the Crimson fell just short in a title game loss to hometown favorites Minnesota.
Fast forward to this season, and only one thing is on Picard’s mind: a national championship. The last remaining 2014 Olympian on the team, she has tried to impart knowledge and the right attitude on the younger players around her.
“They’re great examples,” said Stone about Picard and co-captain goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer. “They’ve had a lot of international experience, they work hard, they’re good leaders. Just watch their day-to-day operation and you can learn something from that as well as other kids, our seniors.”
Picard, the sixth pick in the inaugural National Women’s Hockey League draft, is focused on applying the lessons she learned on Team USA to her role as a co-captain and leader for the Crimson.
“The biggest thing that I learned is that every small thing you can do to get better really does make an impact,” Picard said. “The little things on the ice that don’t seem like they affect the play can really change a game…. With the Olympics, the goal was the gold medal, and coming back to Harvard, it was about getting to share that each day, you’re making progress towards that goal. Your goal should be to make progress towards that goal every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So the story goes, Yale President James Rowland Angell sent Massachusetts Hall a telegram before Harvard’s 1923 commencement exercises. “Please be sure Owen graduates,” it read.
Over the last century, few Harvard athletes have approached the legend of George Owen Jr. ’23.
A three-sport varsity captain, Owen never lost to the Elis on the diamond, the gridiron, or the rink while playing nearly every position. In his first of five seasons as a professional hockey player, he became the first documented NHL player to wear a helmet—his old Harvard football helmet—and won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins. He joins Princeton's Hobey Baker in both the U.S. hockey and college football halls of fame.
For 92 years, Owen also held a special distinction among Harvard men’s hockey captains: he was the last Crimson player to captain the team for multiple seasons. But then an undersized right wing from South Jersey came along.
For the second straight year, Kyle Criscuolo leads Harvard into November. Of the 121 men’s hockey captains to pass through Harvard, he will be just the fourth to serve two terms. According to his teammates, that’s not an accident.
“I think he’s very wise beyond his years. He’s just somebody that people look up to as a model citizen, somebody you aspire to be both on and off the ice,” junior forward Tyler Moy says.
“You see him going out there every day, and he’s working as hard as he can. He does all the things right on the ice,” junior forward Alex Kerfoot says.
“Kyle is a great mentor. He leads me in a great direction not only in hockey but also in school,” freshman forward Ryan Donato says.
At the end of each of Criscuolo’s three seasons at Harvard, his teammates have chosen him to receive the team’s Ralph “Cooney” Weiland Award for “devotion to the game.” Last March in Lake Placid, Criscuolo accepted the Whitelaw Cup at center ice following Harvard’s 4-2 win over Colgate in the ECAC Hockey tournament final. The night before, he received the conference’s student-athlete award.
“He commands very little spotlight but earns the respect of everyone around him because he’s willing to put in the work every day and do everything the right way—even when no one’s looking, and I think that’s what his teammates really respect and appreciate,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says.
Choate Rosemary Hall coach Pat Dennehy fondly remembers Criscuolo’s two years at the Connecticut prep school.
“Coaches say things about players—they’re the first one on, last one off, hard workers—but Kyle was different,” Dennehy says. “He’d go out on the ice by himself or with another guy before practice and work on some really creative things.”
Criscuolo would fill the 15 minutes before his prep school practices with various passing drills, honing his eye for angles around the ice. His repertoire included saucer-pass exercises from behind the net and bank-pass challenges off of goal posts.
His teammates became intrigued and joined in. Eventually, some of the drills made their way into Choate’s games.
“He just made everybody else around him better,” Dennehy says. “I think he helped other good players get better and start to think the game differently.”
His generously-listed 5’9”, 175-pound frame does not easily command the attention of scouts, but his speed and cerebral style have earned Criscuolo second looks.
Earlier this year, Criscuolo planned to attend the Pittsburgh Penguins’ weeklong prospect development camp in July, but he faced a difficult decision about a nagging injury: he could take a cortisone shot and attend the camp, or he could receive surgery and recover over the summer to ensure his health for his senior season.
Criscuolo opted for the surgery and skipped the camp.
“He’s a guy who put his team first and said, ‘I want to have my best health possible for next year; I want to be around as much as I can,’” Donato says.
Criscuolo’s team-first instincts seem to originate with his father, who grew up playing street hockey in the suburbs of Philadelphia before captaining the club team at Drexel University.
Bob Criscuolo had no long-term plans when his second son started skating at age five, but coached him up the ranks as he progressed from the house league to the travel squad.
Out of a lack of high-level hockey experience, Bob says there was not much he could teach his son in the way of intricate skills, so he stuck to three main points: “work hard, be a good leader, and play for the team.”
“He always tried to keep hockey fun for me,” Kyle Criscuolo says. “No matter what age—he wanted me to enjoy it and always harped on the team being bigger than the individual.”
Drew Faust will not receive any telegrams about Kyle Criscuolo this year. Nobody expects him to be Mr. Everything like Harvard’s last two-time captain.
On Harvard’s first line, Criscuolo’s creative yet blue-collar skillset contrasts slightly with the glitzy style of his co-captain Jimmy Vesey, who finished as a finalist last season for the award that bears the name of Owen’s hall-mate. Criscuolo, who assisted on 19 of Vesey’s NCAA-leading 32 goals last season, is more likely to chip and chase the puck than dangle around defenders.
In all likelihood, the Southampton, N.J., native will once again avoid the spotlight this season as his star linemate grabs the headlines. By all indications, Criscuolo is okay with this.
In Harvard’s only exhibition game this year, the team tested out its new home uniforms. The set came with only one front-jersey sticker for the co-captains. Criscuolo let Vesey wear the “C.”
“I’m grateful to have Jimmy as a co-captain, and in terms of his talent, he’s second to none. I’m just happy to be on his line and get the other team’s best everyday,” Criscuolo says.
While he does not figure to surpass his all-world linemate at the pro level, Criscuolo will maintain his dedication to the game in one way or another following Harvard’s commencement exercises next May.
During his recovery from surgery this summer, he spent a week at the Washington Capitals’ front office in Virginia, where he assisted the team’s management in contract negotiations. He also coached a group of high school players through a hockey-specific gym regimen in Philadelphia.
Perhaps one day, Criscuolo will stand behind a bench or take a seat at the opposite side of an arbitration table. But for now, he will work toward following Owen into that League and onto that Cup.
“I’m not going to be a guy that’s going to walk right in,” Criscuolo says, “but having the NHL just one or two levels above college hockey, it gives me hope that I could earn a spot there as well if I get the right opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard women’s hockey sophomore Haley Mullins and McGill’s Melodie Daoust wait at the faceoff circle, a 5’6” goaltender from Bruderheim, Alberta stands in the Crimson crease. It’s been almost three years since she skated onto the ice of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for her first collegiate start against Princeton.
The puck drops. It’s the beginning of the end of Emerance Maschmeyer’s Harvard career.
One of the top goalies in the nation, Maschmeyer enters her final year with the Crimson looking to build on an illustrious career. After last year’s national runner-up performance, the team has big aspirations and will count on the senior throughout her curtain call.
“[Maschmeyer’s] huge,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “If your goaltending is good, it gives you an opportunity to win…. Last year she was huge for us on days when the people in front of here weren’t as good and vice versa.”
High expectations aren’t new for Maschmeyer. After all, she spent her early years playing against boys, becoming just the second woman to play in the Brick Tournament and the Alberta Junior Hockey League, following her idol and Hockey Canada goalie Shannon Szabados. With heightened exposure, Maschmeyer was highly recruited coming into collegiate hockey.
The senior has taken the NCAA by storm, sharing starts her freshman year with now-Minnesota Duluth assistant coach Laura Bellamy ’13 before taking over as a sophomore. Since then, Maschmeyer has been named All-American, All-ECAC, All-Ivy, and a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award—given to the best female collegiate hockey player.
Despite the individual achievements, the goaltender’s focus remains on her team. A co-captain with classmate Michelle Picard, Maschmeyer’s guidance will be pivotal for a team replacing seven graduates, two of whom were Olympians.
In addition to mentoring a new crop of athletes, Maschmeyer will be relied upon to command the team, helping Harvard adjust to the tempo of each game.
“We lean on her a lot…. She’s a huge leader, having three years of experience under her belt,” senior forward Miye D’Oench said. “Being our captain, she’s going to bring lots of experience, a lot of calm when we need her to be and exciting when we need her to be at other times.”
Though Maschmeyer has one season left with the Crimson, she has already begun to pave her future.
Maschmeyer was among twenty athletes selected in the inaugural National Women’s Hockey League draft, taken seventh overall by the Boston Pride, who also drafted D’Oench.
Being drafted, however, is just the tip of the iceberg.
International competition has been a big part of Maschmeyer’s career since a young age. While there has been an increase in professional female hockey opportunities, the Canadian has her eyes set on becoming the starting goaltender for her national team.
Maschmeyer has been tabbed as the goalie of the future for Canada from a young age, drawing parallels to Szabados, who stood in the crease for her country at the 2010 and 2014 Olympics and has mentored Maschmeyer after meeting at the Brick Tournament.
Interestingly, the senior could find herself competing against her idol for starting position at the 2018 Olympics.
“[Szabados] was my role model going up, so to be compared to her is amazing,” Maschmeyer said. “The first time I was compared to her I was like ‘yes, that’s exactly what I wanted’ so it’s cool that I’m at that age where we’re competing.”
The senior is certainly headed in the right direction. Maschmeyer is missing the first five games of the season to compete with Canada at the Four Nations Cup for the second year in a row. The goaltender tallied two wins in the 2014 rendition, helping her home nation claim the title, and was also part of the 2015 IIHF Women’s World Championship squad this summer.
As the collegiate world bids adieu to Maschmeyer, a new journey awaits her. With competition for an Olympic roster spot promising to be difficult, the senior will have to stay on her toes but will have full support from her Harvard hockey family.
“I certainly hope she has an opportunity to play for Team Canada in the Olympic games. I know that’s a goal for her and certainly a goal of ours to help her get there.” Stone said. “The big carrot is the Olympic games.”
There are two years left until the Canadian women’s hockey team skates onto the ice in South Korea. If everything falls into place, Maschmeyer could find herself waiting for the puck to drop once again. This time, however, the Maple Leaf will be emblazoned on her chest as she begins her Olympic career.
All this and more is possible for the girl from Bruderheim, Alberta who—with the confidence and work ethic responsible for her success—patiently awaits her chance at the international spotlight.
“[My] biggest asset is my confidence and knowing how much work I’ve put into my game,” Maschmeyer said. “[Players] never know when they’re going to get the opportunity…. So [it’s important] being ready for that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All eyes are now on the No. 9/9 Harvard women’s hockey team (1-1-1, 1-1-1 ECAC) as it begins its 2015-2016 season with sights set on not only making it to the national championship game once again but also taking home the trophy this time.
The 2014-2015 campaign was the most successful season the women’s hockey program has had in five years, as the team posted a 27-6-3 (16-4-2 ECAC) record. The squad never lost consecutive games, taking home an Ivy League title, Beanpot championship, and ECAC titles in both the tournament and regular season along the way.
In marquee games, the Crimson avenged a 10-2 loss to then No. 2/2 Boston College—not once, but twice—to win the Beanpot in February and to advance to the final round of the NCAA tournament a month later before falling to top-ranked Minnesota in the finals.
Now, going into the 2015-2016 season, it’s a new year, with new faces but the same goal. As it has been for the past few years, the Crimson is one of the teams to beat.
“We had a great season last year, so that kind of puts a target on our back,” co-captain Michelle Picard said. “But honestly, Harvard has such a great tradition of being an excellent program so every year we have a target on our back. We just, every game, go out there, looking to play our best.”
After a strong showing in the preseason with a 3-2 defeat of McGill, with freshman forward Grace Zarzecki scoring the game-winning goal, the Crimson faltered in its opener with a close loss on the road against Dartmouth put pulled out a scoreless tie with No. 4/4 Clarkson at home on Oct. 31.
“Dartmouth was a tough loss for us, but we definitely learned a lot.” Picard said. “We...have to play our game and have confidence in our game.”
The Crimson seemed to gain confidence following the tie, ending the weekend on a high note with a 3-2 win over St. Lawrence when senior forward Miye D’Oench matched her career high of three points with two goals and an assist, and sophomore forward Haley Mullins scored the game-winner.
To keep up the momentum from the St. Lawrence game and to repeat the impressive results of last year, the team will need to rely on the its veteran seniors to guide it through the season full of tough competition.
“We’re pretty young right now,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We’re a different team than we were last year. We’re going to keep our sights set on that Frozen Four, but we have a lot of work to do along the way.”
With captains like Picard, a former Olympian and two-time captain, and Maschmeyer, a 2014-2015 ECAC goaltender of the year finalist and NWHL draftee, Harvard seems to be in good hands. But with them knowing that the dynamic will be different after losing six seniors who made a huge impact, the need to develop the newcomers early will be among Maschmeyer and Picard’s tasks.
“We have a great group of freshmen, and everyone who’s returning is more than capable of filling those shoes,” Picard said. “It’s a new year and that just comes with new challenges and new roles, but everyone’s stepping up.”
Stone’s incoming rookie class hails from Ontario and five different states. Forwards Zarzecki, Erin Ozturk, Bradley Fusco, and Audrey Warner and defensemen Kaitlin Tse and Kate Hallett bring a multitude of talents and experience to the team. Many of them were multi-sport athletes in high school, and all helped lead their respective teams to conference championships.
“Our freshmen are great,” Picard said. “They’re a great group of girls. It’s been so fun to get to know them these first couple of months, and it’s really exciting to see how good they are and how good they’re going to be.”
The initial task is an obvious one—get the incoming players acclimated to the hockey program as soon as possible, and have them start contributing as soon as possible.
“That’s the fun part about coaching—you get new blood,” Stone said. “And the new blood has to learn the Harvard hockey way. They’re going to step up when they’re ready to step up.”
It seems that the freshmen are already stepping up and learning the Stone way, with Zarzecki and Tse already making their presence felt on the ice. Each has earned a point through the early matchups.
With such depth and talent on the team, the women’s icehockey team has the potential to control its destiny.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Times were different when co-captain Kyle Criscuolo stepped onto the ice for the first time his freshman year. Only a season removed from reaching the ECAC tournament finals, Harvard limped to a 10-19-3 record and only six conference wins in 22 tries during the 2012-2013 campaign. Criscuolo and fellow co-captain Jimmy Vesey had just 31 points between them.
The duo’s first season was designed to start a rebuilding process. The co-captains’ last one, they hope, will be one where they complete the process and contend for a national championship.
Coming off a season where the Crimson took home the Whitelaw Cup and the two put up a total of 106 points, the No. 7/6 Harvard men’s ice hockey team enters the year on the national radar.
“Obviously we want to be in the Frozen Four,” junior forward Tyler Moy said. “We’d like to take it home. I don’t think we’re going to try to sell ourselves short by any means.”
With a roster loaded with juniors and seniors, this may be the year for Harvard to strike while the iron is hot and make a serious run to the Frozen Four in Tampa Bay, Fla. This year’s seniors were responsible for more than 39 percent of the team’s points last year, while current juniors—led by Alexander Kerfoot and Tyler Moy—notched nearly the same amount with 38 percent of the output. Given one more year to mesh, the upperclassmen will be the driving force of this squad.
“A lot of big parts of the team are healthy right now—it’s something that you want to ride out as long as you can,” Moy said. “I think you can look at our team now and say that we have a really good opportunity of making that dream of success come true.”
Last season’s campaign earned the respect of coaches around the conference. The ECAC Coaches’ preseason poll dubbed the Crimson (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) the top team in the conference.
The team placed ninth in the poll to begin last season before winning the conference tournament and earning a berth in the NCAA tournament.
The squad has also been invited to play in mid-season tournaments at Notre Dame and Minnesota in the aftermath of the team’s meteoric rise last season.
“Teams want to prove to the nation and prove to us that they can compete with us,” Moy said. “That’s something that we take pride in. We understand that there’s never going to be an easy night.”
Harvard will rely upon last year’s ECAC-best offense to help them bring back the Whitelaw Cup to Cambridge for the second straight season. If this past weekend’s results are any indicator of the future, there should not be much concern about a drop in production. The Crimson poured it on against the Big Green both at Dartmouth and at the Bright-Landry Center, combining for 12 goals during the home-and-home weekend series.
The power play has been an early strength for the Crimson thus far during the young 2015-2016 season. In nine tries, the team has found twine on five occasions. The Crimson led the conference in power-play conversion rate last year, averaging more than one goal in five tries.
While playing time will be dominated by those with at least two years of collegiate hockey under their belts, a few underclassmen could provide the boost necessary for the team to make the jump from NCAA tournament participants to NCAA champions. Freshman forward Ryan Donato has already notched two goals and two assists. Minnesota native Jacob Olson found the back of the net for the first Harvard goal of the year in Hanover, N.H., which came off a feed from junior Devin Tringale.
But for all of the offensive firepower that Harvard boasts, the Crimson can only put one man in the crease. Who that man would be for the season opener remained unknown before sophomore Merrick Madsen darted out between the pipes on Saturday in Hanover.
While Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 stressed that a goaltender rotation was not out of the question, he has stuck with the Philadelphia Flyers prospect for the first 120 minutes of the regular season. The Acton, Calif., native hasn’t given Donato a reason to make a change, however, saving 43 of the 45 shots that he has faced thus far in front of a new-look defensive unit.
“We look at defense as the responsibility of all six guys,” Donato said. “But there’s no denying we’re working in guys with little experience, and it will be something that we have to develop as we go through the year.”
With the offensive unit a relatively known quantity, the development of Madsen and the defensive unit may dictate how far into the postseason the Crimson will play this season.
“We embrace the internal expectations,” Donato said. “When it’s all said and done, our job is to try to improve every day, every game. We recognize that we’re going to really have to develop to be the team we want to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the graduations of co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi ’15, leading scorer Wesley Saunders ’15, and key reserves Jonah Travis ’15 and Kenyatta Smith ’15, the Harvard men’s basketball team already needed inexperienced players to step into bigger roles this season.
However, the team’s biggest loss came over the summer when co-captain and starting point guard Siyani Chambers tore his ACL. Chambers, who has consistently been deemed the team’s most important player over the last three seasons by Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, was slated to be the focal point of the Crimson offense and the team’s floor general this season before the injury derailed that plan.
“Obviously, you count on losing the other guys, [but] we never counted on losing [Siyani], and I don’t think anyone did,” Amaker said. “You adjust, and it is all about that all the time—to maneuver and adjust and maximize who we are and where we are.”
The three-headed monster tasked with attempting to replicate Chambers’s production consists of an untested freshman, the team’s top three-point shooter, and a junior who has played all of 60 minutes in his college career. For Tommy McCarthy, Corbin Miller, and Matt Fraschilla, the injury to Chambers provides an opportunity to lead the starters of the five-time defending Ivy League champs.
While each member of the trio figures to see game action, Amaker has been coy about how he will divvy up minutes.
“If we had to begin today or tomorrow, we have a few guys we’ve kind of looked and changed and tinkered,” Amaker said. “We’ll get a chance to see what that’s like this weekend. I think that gives us a few more days this week to experiment, if you will, but I do think this weekend we’ll have a certain lineup. Will that lineup be the one we stay with? Who knows, but this weekend gives us a chance with an exhibition.”
For McCarthy, the injury means that his opportunity to make an impact comes earlier than expected; for Miller, it signals a potential position switch; for Fraschilla, it creates a chance to see meaningful minutes and push his teammates.
“I realize this is a huge opportunity for me to step in and fight for some minutes on the floor,” McCarthy said. “Coming in, even with Siyani here, I was hoping to make an impact freshman year, but, obviously, this kind of enhances that. It’s a huge opportunity for me.”
McCarthy, a three-year starter at La Costa Canyon High School in Carlsbad, Calif., is expected to shoulder the lion’s share of the point guard load. Amaker is no stranger to placing responsibility on his younger players, and McCarthy has had to be a leader on an upperclassman-laden team before.
“He was in a similar situation for me as a sophomore,” said David Cassaw, McCarthy’s high school coach. “He was starting with four seniors. He’s got a lot of pride and a lot of confidence in his game. I think what’s going to carry him is he’s confident, and the reason he’s confident is because he’s put a lot of time in.”
Three seasons ago, Amaker started Chambers at point guard for all 30 of the team’s games after Brandyn Curry ’14 withdrew from the college. As a freshman, Chambers averaged nearly 38 minutes a game en route to claiming Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors and quarterbacking the team to its first NCAA tournament win in program history.
“I’m not the same player [as Siyani],” McCarthy said. “There’s a lot of things that he does that I can’t do, and I think there’s some things that I can do that he didn’t bring. I think it’s a different style, but the leadership role is what’s going to be a constant.”
McCarthy started opposite Fraschilla in the team’s Crimson and Black scrimmage during Crimson Madness last month. The freshman averaged 19.6 points and 4.4 assists last season at La Costa Canyon and was rated a three-star prospect by several recruiting outlets.
“He was always playing, always working on his game, always evolving his game,” Cassaw said. “The thing I saw was his ability to become more and more confident as a ball handler. I saw him becoming more confident as a passer and more well-rounded as a player. By the time he got to his senior year, he was setting the table for us, making passes, scoring when necessary.”
While losing Chambers puts Harvard in a difficult situation, all three of the point guards competing for the starting role feel that they are ready and have improved as players due to the competition this fall.
“I got to learn a lot of things from them—just about our system, standards, work ethic—because they’re guys who have been here for a few years,” McCarthy said. “They’ve really helped bring me along as a freshman, showing me the ropes. Competing against them, they’re both great players, so it’s definitely made me step my game up and made me a lot better player.”
Miller, the most experienced of the trio, figures to be McCarthy’s backup but will see most of his minutes at shooting guard. While McCarthy is a pass-first point guard who does have the ability to attack the rim, Miller is more of a spot-up shooter. Seventy-seven percent of the junior’s points last season came off of three pointers.
Miller and freshman Corey Johnson, the team’s two best outside shooters, figure to be the floor spacers in Amaker’s inside-out offense, which will be centered around junior forward Zena Edosomwan.
“I’m not entirely sure what [my role] will be,” Miller said. “In past years, I’ve played a little bit at the point. Obviously, my strengths are shooting the ball and have been and that’s been my role in the past.”
That leaves Fraschilla. The Dallas native is the the team’s only true point guard who has played in a college game. While the junior figures to receive more meaningful minutes than he has in the past two seasons, Fraschilla has embraced the role of mentor to McCarthy and knows that how he practices will make everyone around him better.
“[The three of us] have really been pushing each other in practice, and you can’t underestimate the value of what it’s like going against each other everyday,” Fraschilla said. “We’re not taking it easy on each other. We’re going to have some games this year that are going to be absolute dogfights, so we have to be 110 percent on each other everyday.”
While whoever starts on Saturday in an exhibition against McGill and in next Friday’s regular season opener against MIT will not match Chambers’s experience and talent, Amaker insists that McCarthy, Miller, and Fraschilla just need to be themselves.
“Our philosophy hasn’t changed a heck of a lot,” Amaker said. “We’re not going to change our principles or our philosophy, but we may have to tinker and adjust some things or change a tactic or two...and that’s ok, we’ve done it in the past. We’ve tinkered and changed but we didn’t change the foundation or the philosophy of our system, which we believe heavily in and our players believe in as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The story of the offseason for the Harvard men’s basketball team has been the absence of senior guard Siyani Chambers. After tearing his ACL during a summer workout, dozens of questions have arisen within the team and amongst spectators of the Crimson.
Losing nearly 70 percent of its scoring from last year, the team needs someone to become an offensive focal point. Replacing Chambers is no small task—the season may depend on whether freshman Tommy McCarthy is up for the task.
Yet, another question rings loudest: Who will lead this young Harvard team?
Coach Tommy Amaker and Harvard have an answer: Evan Cummins.
After leading the 2014-2015 squad as a co-captain alongside Steve Moundou-Missi ’15, Chambers was slated to fill the same role this season. Cummins was voted by his peers as Chambers’s fellow captain, but now holds the reins in Chambers’s absence in leading what Amaker has deemed one of his youngest teams in recent years.
“HE LETS US CALL HIM DAD”
When asked about Cummins’ role as a leader, freshman guard Corey Johnson was effusive.
“He’s just the kind of guy that brings everyone together to talk as a team...leading us in every practice and being vocal and just keeping us going all the time,” Johnson said.
“He lets us call him Dad,” the freshman added with a smile.
Cummins has been a guiding force in welcoming the six rookies to the Crimson basketball program as several of the freshmen look to make an impact early on. As the rookies deal with the challenges of transitioning from high school basketball along with the academic and social adjustments of college, Cummins has led by example.
Freshman guard Tommy McCarthy spoke about how Cummins has helped him become a leader on the team as the Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., native has begun to shoulder the point guard responsibilities that Chambers’ injury has left unfulfilled.
“As a freshman, you know, I had so many questions coming in, different things that coach Amaker wanted and their standards and stuff like that,” McCarthy said. “He’s been great just showing me everything that I need to do and helping me along, and he’s always encouraging me, telling me to talk more, and you know kind of really like push me into that leadership role.”
A CULTURE OF LEADERSHIP
From Moundou-Missi to Christian Webster ’13, the standard for a good captain has become ingrained in the system of Harvard basketball.
“Evan developed into a great leader within the program,” Webster said. “He leads by example on and off the court. He is a perfect example of what it means to be a Harvard basketball player.”
But Cummins’s leadership education didn’t just begin at Harvard. It started much earlier when he stepped on the court at Northfield Mount Hermon.
First, as a sophomore, he got the chance to learn from upperclassmen who would go on to captain Division I teams, including Laurent Rivard ’14. Under their leadership, Cummins was a member of a team that went to play in the New England Championship finals.
But then it was his turn.
Alongside fellow captains Tommy Carpenter and Ethan O’Day, now captains at Dartmouth and Vermont, respectively, Cummins became captain for the Hoggers during his senior season. The trio was joined by veteran point guard Spike Albrecht, who is now the captain of Michigan.
“There was this culture of leadership where even if you aren’t captain on our team, you learn to be a leader,” NMH coach John Carroll said. “Obviously Evan learned his skills from great captains and shared that responsibility with people who went on to be great captains.”
HIS TIME
Though he has not necessarily filled the stat sheet, Cummins is a perfect example of what Amaker said he has stressed to his team: “they cannot just think of it being their turn, they need to think of it more as being their time.”
Cummins has gotten sporadic minutes throughout his career with the Crimson, almost all of them coming off the bench. Since joining the team in 2012, the Westborough, Mass. native has averaged just 2.4 points per game in approximately 10 minutes on the court.
However, after the departure of five of the team’s six top scorers, Cummins will likely play a larger role in the team’s offense. As a recruit, Cummins was known for his scoring versatility, as his size allows him to pound the ball in the paint, but his length makes it easier for him to score from outside.
Cummins’s past experience will be extremely valuable on a team with just three seniors. Along with losing most of its scoring output, the Crimson lost 61.7 percent of its minutes.
“[H]e’s been in the NCAA tournament three times, he’s won three Ivy League titles,” junior guard Matt Fraschilla said. “That’s something that’s invaluable in terms of being able to take his experience and kind of use that to lead. He’s been in every situation you can imagine over the past three years, whether it’s up in Vermont or playing North Carolina in the NCAA tournament or Michigan State or MIT. It doesn’t matter: he’s been there.”
While finding minimal playing time as a freshman in the Ivy League is not uncommon, Cummins saw a major uptick in minutes during his sophomore campaign. After averaging just 2.7 minutes in six games played during his rookie year, the forward saw action in 30 games his second year, seeing an average of 10.1 minutes of action. However during his junior season, his stats remained nearly stagnant, if not lower in some categories.
But he has been plagued by a deep bench. At times, Cummins found himself the third big man off the pine behind Kenyatta Smith ’15 and Jonah Travis ’15. Though the Crimson will look to get more from junior Zena Edosomwan and sophomore Chris Egi, Cummins may see more opportunities to be the go-to player down low, rather than finding himself in a supporting role.
“He is an amazing passer and really crafty around the rim,” Edosomwan said. “Sometimes he will get you with those little hook shots here and there.”
As a recognized leader and the opportunity wide open to make an impact on a team in transition, the 2015-2016 season could certainly be Cummins’s time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year’s Harvard women’s basketball season can be summed up by two home Ivy League games.
The first was a blowout—a 50-point loss to Princeton. The Crimson allowed 96 points, the most given up to a conference opponent since 2000.
The second, just a week later, was a hard-fought, organized 65-55 victory that snapped a surging Yale team’s seven-game win streak. Eight Harvard players got on the board, handing the Bulldogs their first conference loss of the season.
The 2014-2015 team was, in a word, inconsistent. The Crimson, which split its Ancient Eight record, winning seven and losing seven, lost in its first meetings with Dartmouth, Columbia, and Brown, only to decisively top all three teams later in the season. The team made just 18 percent of its three-pointers one game and 60 percent the next—the outcome of every game was unpredictable.
“Last year we had high points and low points, but I don’t think we were ever as consistent as we needed to be in any regard and in any statistic,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
However, according to the team, the past is completely irrelevant to this season. As they tell it, Harvard women’s basketball is reinventing itself.
A change is perhaps unavoidable, because the Crimson lost two of its top three scorers, Temi Fagbenle ’15 and Erin McDonnell ’15, to graduation, as well as sophomore center Anna Lachenauer, who left the team earlier this year.
Because crucial spots have opened up, Harvard will be forced to look to a number of new faces, including seven freshmen, to make their mark this season. Although Delaney-Smith is confident in the abilities of her less experienced players, she also acknowledges that the transition to college basketball may take time.
The phrase the coach uses again and again is “learning curve.” It is inevitable that it may take a few games for players to to get comfortable in unfamiliar roles. But it won’t be only the rookies who will need to adjust to an altered game plan, because the Crimson will be completely changing the way that it plays.
“As a team, we are not even comparable to last year,” co-captain AnnMarie Healy said. “Everything is new. What we’ve been doing in the past hasn’t been working, so we’re really excited about our new system.”
The key to this squad’s strategy is a change of focus.
Last year, the Harvard front line ranked in the top three in the Ancient Eight for scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team wasn’t able to bolster its offensive production at the other end of the court. The Crimson had the worst scoring defense in the league last year, allowing an average of 69.7 points per game.
A stronger defense will be key to this year’s new system, something that Delaney-Smith attributed to the fact that five of the seven incoming freshmen are guards.
“We’re very athletic, and we’re very deep in the guard spot,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we’re going to be able to run the floor very well, and defensively I think that allows us a lot of versatility.
With the bevy of young talent this season, Harvard will look to win its first Ivy title since 2008. The Crimson’s new playbook will likely feature a movement away from last year’s attack-driven strategy towards a team that finds its strength in a guard-heavy backcourt.
The attempt to integrate both a new offense and new players could lead to some of the inconsistency that plagued Harvard last season. However, the fact that many of the players come in with a clean slate is a double-edged sword; it means they have a lot to learn, but little to override.
This is not to say that the freshmen will have to reshape the team all on their own. Harvard’s co-captains, Healy and Kit Metoyer, have a wealth of experience between them. Healy remained consistent throughout last season, shooting 52 percent from the floor, which was second best in the Ivy League, and averaging 13.4 points a game. Metoyer, meanwhile, will be responsible for mentoring the group of new point guards as the most veteran player at the point on the team.
Harvard hopes to combine this abundance of leadership with the raw ability of its rookies to find consistency in their performance. If the Crimson can avoid the all-too-familiar specter of injury, it may be in a position to make noise in the Ivies.
Though Harvard is a team confronted with the challenge of finding a new identity, it is certainly not alone in the Ancient Eight.
Last year’s conference champion, No. 25 Princeton, lost its top performer and the catalyst to its offense in Blake Dietrick, who led the Ancient Eight in total points and assists in 2014-2015 and was unanimously named Ivy League Player of the Year.
Penn, which finished second in the conference last year, will face a similar problem. The Quakers graduated four seniors, all of whom appeared in every game last season. Yale lost only one player to graduation, but the Bulldogs took on a new head coach in Allison Guth, and adjusting to her style of coaching may take time.
In a league in flux, with a roster packed with new faces, Harvard will look to an overhauled system in hopes of finding its footing faster than its rivals. But even in the midst of change, the Crimson is grounded by an unchanging objective.
“Our goal is always to win the Ivy title,” Delaney-Smith said. “That stays constant year in and year out. We did lose some incredibly talented players, so it looks like the hill that we have to climb is a little higher, but I think the league is going to be full of surprises.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­In an offseason dominated by ominous headlines, recruiting was a positive footnote for the Harvard men’s basketball team. The commitments of four-star recruits Robert Baker Jr. and Bryce Aiken vaulted the Crimson’s 2020 recruiting class into the top 10, a historic finish if it holds up. Of the seven teams currently ahead of Harvard, four have made a Final Four over the last two years.
For years, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has lapped the rest of the Ivy League field in recruiting. Since Amaker’s arrival, Harvard has nabbed 13 four-star recruits—the rest of the league has three combined. The incoming Class of 2020 has six three- or four-star freshmen. As of now, that’s six more than the field.
The gap off the court hardly narrows on the hardwood—in March, the team clinched its fifth straight conference championship, its fourth straight trip to the Dance, and the unofficial title of dynasty.
When a would-be buzzer-beater rolled off the rim, Cinderella left early for the first time in three years, however, starting an offseason of turnover. Four members of the eight-man rotation, including two first-team All-Ivy talents in Steve Moundou-Missi and Wesley Saunders, graduated in May. Three months later, starting point guard Siyani Chambers tore his ACL in practice; by early September he had left campus, taking a leave of absence to preserve his eligibility.
The occupants of the throne are hardly recognizable. Of the players that return, just two averaged at least 20 minutes a game last year. Combined, the team’s six upperclassmen produced 19.2 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 2.4 assists a game last year. Saunders had 16.6, 6.1, and 4.3 by himself.
“[This year], it’s going to have to come from everyone,” co-captain Evan Cummins said. “It’s not going be one guy or one specific thing.”
Chambers’ absence looms largest. Recruiting has defined the team’s ability to reload on the fly. For years, Amaker has handpicked his starter’s replacements years in advance—squint at sophomores Andre Chatfield and Chris Egi and you can see the makings of the next Saunders and Moundou-Missi. Yet, for two years, Chambers’ replacement never arrived. Of the three non-freshmen guards on the roster, two—Chatfield and junior Corbin Miller—are more shotmakers than shot creators. Junior Matt Fraschilla, generously listed at 5’11”, has three career field goals in two years.
Freshman Tommy McCarthy, a three-star recruit from California, may be what the team needs. McCarthy broke down Fraschilla off the dribble at will during the team’s public preseason scrimmage and flashed the precocious vision that teammates and coaches ascribe to Chambers. He was not expected to start his freshman year, but neither was Chambers—in both cases, a leave of absence from the incumbent opened a door for the rookie.
McCarthy’s performance has already turned heads. While Amaker refused to even name a starting lineup for Saturday’s scrimmage, he admitted McCarthy and fellow freshman Corey Johnson have already played their way into line for minutes when it counts.
“With Tommy and Corey in particular, opportunities are going to be presented quicker than [with] other kids as freshman players,” Amaker noted at the team’s first press conference. However, he quickly qualified his previous statement. “But they have to earn it… that’s big in our program.”
Playing freshmen is rare for Amaker. In the last five years, only Chambers and Laurent Rivard ’14 have cracked the starting lineup. Just two others—Moundou-Missi and Saunders—have averaged even 10 points a game. Yet with as many freshmen as upperclassmen on his roster, Amaker has little time to wait for them to mature.
“We’re as young as we’ve been in quite some time so it’s going to take some time for us to gel,” Amaker said. “It could be an even tougher process [than usual] in that regard for us to find out exactly who we are this year and who we have a chance to become.”
The road to internal resolution has some early speed bumps. A day after opening the season with MIT, Harvard heads to Providence—a No. 6 seed in last year’s tournament. In the eight days that follow, it will take on UMass and Boston College, attempting to assert itself as the best team in the Commonwealth. Three weeks after that is a trip to Lawrence to battle the preseason No. 4 Kansas Jayhawks, looking to acquit itself better than it did during last year’s 49-point humiliation in Charlottesville against Virginia.
Conference play will pose its own set of challenges. The league is substantially deeper than in 2012, when Chambers led a team reeling from the departure of four starters to an unlikely league championship. Yale, the preseason favorite, returns the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year.
Columbia has arguably the league’s most dynamic point guard and power forward in Maodo Lo and Alex Rosenberg, while Princeton’s wing combination of Spencer Weisz and Steven Cook could lead it to an Ancient Eight title. Harvard was picked to finish fourth in the Ivy League preseason poll, its lowest showing since 2009.
Amaker and his team care little for the polls, however. Inside the program, internal standards dominate outside expectations, and the coach claims to only hear media commentary when it comes from his players’ Twitter feeds. To Amaker, regardless of his team’s youth and inexperience, regardless of preseason accolades, regardless of who has left, his team will remain the hunted.
“We are going to get everyone’s best shot,” Amaker said. “That requires us to be as good as we can possible be every day, every night, every game and that’s what we are striving for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The Harvard women’s basketball team enters the 2015-2016 season with seven new freshman faces. While all were standouts in high school, competing for the Ivy League championship poses new challenges and a different level of competition.
Due to injuries and the graduation of three starters, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith will be calling on several of her first-year players early on.
“This year, no matter their role, every freshman will make a big impact on our team,” co-captain AnnMarie Healy said. “The game is only the final product of a process in which everyone contributes.”
The team boasts just three seniors, three sophomores, and four juniors. This includes one sophomore, Taylor Rooks, who is sitting out the 2015-2016 season in residency after transferring from Stanford. At seven, the freshman class is by far the largest.
Five of the seven new additions are guards, which will help fill the gap left by former starting point guard Ali Curtis ’15.
The first of those is 5’7’’ guard Sydney Skinner. Skinner, who comes from Plano, Texas, has come a long way since her days of playing basketball in kindergarten. As a senior in high school, she was a McDonald’s All-American nominee, one of the highest honors for any high school basketball player.
In the years between, Skinner learned to love everything basketball through her older brother, who acted as both coach and trainer to develop her into the player she is today. She captained her high school squad as both a junior and a senior, leading the team to four consecutive District 10 championships. Her success has translated into confidence about her ability to drive play from the guard position.
“I can bring leadership at the point guard position,” Skinner said. “A voice on the court.”
According to her teammates, Skinner possesses considerable talents both on and off the ball.
“Sydney plays very confidently,” Healy said. “As a point guard, this is an intangible. Good defense and having a great drive are a given.”
Competing at the point guard position with Skinner is freshman Nani Redford, who boasts both quickness and defensive tenacity at the position. Redford started playing basketball in fourth grade and almost immediately joined an AAU team. She was a three-year starter at her high school, which was ranked eighth in the nation her junior year.
This season, Redford will not be playing at the two—as she has done over her career—but instead will be taking the court as a point guard.
“It’s different for me compared to playing off the ball as I had before,” Redford said. “I’ve been playing basketball for many years now. So it’s not bad but definitely an adjustment.”
However, playing as a point guard means that she will play more on-ball defense, which Healy describes as one of her greatest attributes.
“I am so impressed by Nani’s defense,” Healy said. “She will tire out every point guard because of her combination of quickness and endurance.”
Adding to the backcourt depth is Indiana native Madeline Raster. Raster’s ability to get to the net and tenacious rebounding ability distinguished her as a recruit. Raster is joined in the backcourt by guard Kelsey Bogdan from nearby Illinois, who played on an AAU squad for eight years.
Brittney Deadwiler, a guard out of Union City, Calif., is the only freshman walk-on for the 2015-2016 season. After the uncertainty of walking on, Deadwiler has made an impression on her teammates with her intensity and energy. In high school, she was a three-year letter-winner in triple jump, long jump, and high jump.
The remaining two rookies, Hayley Isenberg and Sarah Luedke, will join Healy in the frontcourt as the Crimson seeks to fill the shoes of Temi Fagbenle ’15, who led the team last year in points per game with 14.4.
Isenberg, a 6’2’’ forward out of Dallas, wants to improve and learn from the upperclassmen as much as possible this season but chances are, they might be learning a fair amount from her as well.
Her length, height, and ability to play both in the paint and beyond the three-point line make her a challenging mark for any defender. Like Skinner, Isenberg was a McDonald’s All-American nominee as a senior, when she broke her own high school single-season block record by 15, finishing with 111 on the year.
While Isenberg hopes to bolster the Crimson on the court, she is also focused on helping her teammates on the sidelines.
“Off the court, it’s about being really supportive for our teammates,” Isenberg said. “It’s really hard to have a short memory, so I want to make sure my teammates’ minds are on the next play.”
Luedke, a three-time captain from Longview, Wash., earned high school records in career points, blocks and rebounds. If these high school stats are any indication, Harvard has acquired a dominant inside force.
“Sarah brings a lot to our team by being big inside, getting boards, and finishing her one dribble power move,” Healy said.
In a league where the rookies are forced to play against several competitive Ancient Eight opponents, including nationally ranked Princeton, they must be ready to go when called upon. This season, simply due to the team’s large incoming class relative to the rest of the squad, it will be critical for the freshmen to live up to Delaney-Smith’s adage of not playing like freshmen.
“We will play a lot of freshmen,” Delaney-Smith said. “Sometimes they’ll be great, sometimes they’ll make freshman mistakes, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s okay.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventeen years ago, the Harvard women’s basketball team cemented its spot in basketball history by defeating top-seeded Stanford in the first round of the 1998 NCAA tournament. It’s the only time in NCAA basketball history a No. 16 seed has beaten a No. 1 seed.
For three of Harvard’s new coaches—Mike Roux, Heidi Banks, and Jasmine Sborov—the opportunity to join such a legacy with head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was one they simply couldn’t pass up. Far removed from the legacy of the ’98 team but still under the helm of the winningest coach in Ivy League history, the Harvard women’s basketball team is looking to rebuild that legacy with the help of these three faces.
Coming off an up and down season last year, Delaney-Smith is positive about the changes in the coaching staff.
“They’ve already made an impact,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re perfect fits for what we do and for my philosophy, so I couldn’t be happier with them. But your first year anywhere comes with a learning curve.”
For a coach who’s been at the helm of one of the most successful programs in the Ivy League for 33 years, keeping a competitive program with three new coaches and seven new freshmen is no easy task.
“I think the Harvard student-athlete is different than the rest of the world, so I think there’s that comfort zone,” Delaney-Smith said. “They have to get comfortable there, and again I couldn’t be happier with where we are, and I think we’re all going to grow together.”
Following the departure of Temi Fagbenle ’15 and Erin McDonnell ’15, who averaged 14.4 and 12.9 points per game last year, respectively, the new coaching staff is hoping to develop the young core of 10 underclassmen.
Banks, the new director of basketball operations, is excited for the opportunity to work with this young core. Coming off four years as assistant coach at Amherst with a team that had two Final Four appearances, Banks is hoping to make an impact.
“We do have a lot of young kids and we do know that there is going to be a learning curve,” Banks said. “It’s just kind of helping our kids grow into their roles, helping them know their roles, and making them comfortable in their roles. We understand we have a young team, and we know what that means, but we’re ready for it.”
Being responsible for guard development at Amherst, Banks is hoping to bring consistency to a position left open by the graduation of Ali Curtis ’15.
“[I’m] looking to bring consistency to our team, trying to work with our guards to get them comfortable so that we’re able to have a specific role at the guard position,” Banks said. “Just making them feel comfortable and helping them take on their roles.”
With five of the squad’s seven freshman starting at the guard position, developing the team at the one and two will be imperative given that the team had the second worst turnover margin in the Ivy League and averaged 17.6 turnovers a game.
After three years as associate head coach at the University of New Hampshire, Roux is also excited about what Harvard’s seven freshman bring to the mix.
“They bring some offensive explosiveness. They bring some defensive tenacity that I think will help us on the perimeter,” Roux said. “They’re all growing and learning and developing as we go, but I think they’re going to have great freshman years, and I think their careers are going to be very bright here.”
Despite the young core, the Crimson’s upperclassmen are still imperative to the success of the team, with co-captain AnnMarie Healy averaging 13.4 points a game last year and both co-captain Kit Metoyer and senior Shilpa Tummala averaging at least five.
“I think that the upperclassmen here at Harvard are solid,” Roux said. “The structure, the foundation that is here, is great. AnnMarie, Kit, and Shilpa are all really good players and great leaders for our program, for our young kids.
Roux, who led a senior-heavy squad at UNH to its third-highest win total in 2013, is excited about developing a young squad as he eases into his new position.
“I think that our freshman will learn and grow from them, and I think that’s all you can ask for when you step into a program and ask what your upperclassmen can do for your young kids—just teaching them the culture and the ways Harvard has been successful for so many years,” Roux said.
Also joining the coaching staff this year is Sborov. Having graduated this past year from the University of Colorado where she lettered for four years, Sborov is the youngest member of the coaching staff.
Despite the recent change from player to coach, Sborov believes being a recent grad is an advantage as she begins her coaching career.
“Being not so removed from [basketball], I understand exactly what the players are going through just because I was there not long ago at all,” Sborov said. “My memory as far as the experience is really fresh, so I can really relate to them a lot.”
Coming from a Colorado team where she averaged 6.5 points during her senior season in a tough Pac-12 conference, Sborov is excited to work with a young Crimson squad.
“This team is hungry,” Sborov said. “They have such a strong desire to learn and to grow, and they’re hungry to get better. They’re hungry to learn more and to feel what it feels like to win and to go to a championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After breaking yet another record, the Harvard women’s rugby team is set to play Brown again. This time, the Ivy League title is at stake.
The Crimson put up a program-record 111 points against Yale in September, but went on to lose its first regular-season game to Brown a week later. In its latest outing, the dynamic Harvard offense did it again, setting a new high score by pushing across 132 points in a blowout win over Penn.
The Crimson (4-2-0, 3-2-0 Ivy League) will now travel to Hanover on Saturday to open the Ivy Tournament with a rematch against the defending champion Bears (5-2-0, 4-1-0), looking to even up the season series against a team it has gone 2-3-1 against all-time.
The last time the two teams played, Brown held a 22-5 halftime lead that Harvard was able to cut to 22-12. The Bears then pulled away for a 44-17 victory.
“We went into [that first game] a little underprepared mentally,” freshman Susie Clements said. “Throughout the week, we focused on certain players and the aura of Brown, rather than the actual game plan and the way that we were going to play. That’s something that’s changed this weekend—we’re much more confident about our game plan and our game focus.”
The top four teams of the conference—Dartmouth, Brown, Harvard, and Princeton—will compete for the Ivy Conference title in the two-day event hosted by the Big Green.
The winner of Saturday’s semifinal will go on to play the winner of the Dartmouth-Princeton game for the Ivy Tournament title on Sunday.
The Crimson finished the regular season third in the Ivy standings with 15 points, one spot behind Brown with 21 points. Host Dartmouth finished atop the Ivy League with 24 points and a perfect 5-0-0 conference record. The three universities are the only Ivy members that currently sponsor women’s rugby as a varsity sport.
Harvard’s newest varsity team features a talented crop of underclassmen—seven different freshmen have started at least once this season, and five of the Crimson’s six games have featured a try scored by a freshman.
“It’s exciting—it’s the first year we’ve gone on a recruitment drive,” Clements said. “A lot of the freshman coming in are very exciting. It’s a pretty young squad, but everyone’s got a lot of potential.”
Clements scored a try in the route against Yale, part of an offensive attack spearheaded by the Harvard freshman class. Caitlin Wiegel and Sarah Lipson led the charge, each scoring three tries apiece for the Crimson.
“The freshman class has been critical for us—we depend a ton on them all over the field,” senior co-captain Hope Schwartz said. “All of the freshman who’ve gotten playing time have all stepped as playmakers on the field, and it’s been amazing to see them develop and watch them integrate into a team.”
Schwartz also noted how the freshman have made an immediate impact on the team.
“Having the talent and the fresh eyes out there has allowed us to elevate our level of play to a place that I haven’t seen in my four years on the team,” the veteran said. “It’s really exciting to know that they still have so much time in front of them.”
Harvard is coming off a stretch of alternating wins and losses, sandwiching big wins over Yale, Princeton, and Penn with losses to Brown and Dartmouth. The team also features an explosive offense that has been historic at times. The Crimson is the only Ivy team to have surpassed the 100-point mark this season, and the first in Ivy history to do so multiple times in a season.
Harvard won the Ivy Tournament in 2013, but was eliminated in 2014 by the eventual champions Brown. It has not beaten Brown since the fall of 2013, when it swept the season series 2-0. This will be Schwartz’s, and the senior class’, last Ivy Tournament in the Crimson uniform, a tournament they’re looking to finish on top of.
“We were happy with last year’s performance,” Schwartz said. “But it always leaves you hungry not to finish first.”

Snapchat is constantly coming up with new ways to try and keep us entertained. One of the most recent additions is the Ivy League Campus Story, providing us with a live update of what is going on at the other seven Ivies. What started as an average live update has turned into a wildly interactive, intercollegiate social media experience. Since only people on an Ivy campus can see the live story, there are a number of things you would not understand if you haven’t been keeping up-to-date with the live streams, including:
Ivy Challenges
These always seem to start randomly, and take off extremely quickly. Some of the Ivy Challenges have included the Sunset Challenge, the Acapella Challenge, and that one weird dance that looks more like a gallop than anything else. These friendly competitions might feel like spam, but occasionally they offer up a good laugh.
Sibling/Best Friend Shout-Outs
People on the Ivy League Campus Story have taken to giving shout-outs to their best friends/brothers/sisters/cousins across the Ivies: “Hey, it’s Sarah from Dartmouth, shout out to my best friend Courtney at Brown!” And then a few stories later, “Hey it’s Courtney from Brown, shout out to Sarah at Dartmouth!” There are usually several of these sprinkled into every 24-hour period. Who knew there were so many power-couple friendships and families out there?
Intercollegiate Love Affairs
In addition to talking to friends, students have not hesitated to publicly confess their love for people they have viewed on the campus story. Every 24 hours, there are at least three posts that go somewhere along the lines of: “Princeton guy in the blue shirt, I love your eyes.” So if you peep a cute guy on the football team in the background of someone else’s snapchat, shout him out, and top it off with a heart-eyed emoji. It’s possible he might even snap you back. The beginning of your Ivy romance could start here.
Where is Harvard??
The most noticeable part of the of the Ivy League Campus Story might just be the lack of Harvard presence. Many a Harvard student has tried and failed to get their ten seconds of Ivy League fame on Snapchat. It just seems how hard we try, none of our snaps make the cut. We have to do better.

As the second round of mid-terms approaches, final papers beckon, and the days grow shorter, demand is steadily rising for daytime study spots. While the countless libraries make for productive environments, cafes may be more effective for some (background noise, what up). 
Here are a few cafes that may help fill that void and take your mind to a happier place:
1) Jenny's Cafe, Harvard Art Museums 
The first choice is actually right here on campus, in a museum less than half the College has probably ever stepped foot in. Tucked away in the far right corner of the museum's first floor atrium is the quaint Jenny's Cafe. Pick up anything from the most delicately prepared caffe macchiato to a gluten-free lasagna prepared in the professional kitchen located in the basement of the museum. The staff are some of the friendliest I've ever encountered in a cafe. While Jenny’s has some seating, it is relatively small. But don’t worry, there are tables and chairs just outside the cafe in the atrium. The minimalist, clean design of the newly renovated museum makes for a prime study spot and if you’re looking to take advantage of that limited daylight, no better place than this window haven.
2) Starbuck's Coffee, in a land far, far away (468 Broadway, Cambridge– and in Harvard speak, 2 minutes beyond Pennypacker)
Now don't judge me. This post is not about finding the most hipster (or whatever millennial term you want to go for) coffee shop, but instead some of the best places to study and get a cup of joe. It's a Starbucks, so not much to say about the interior: black chairs, dark brown tables– but this one is almost always empty. No need to worry about flocks of tourists, noise and preteens desperate for pumpkin spiced lattes. This Starbucks is well removed from College culture, so you can sit down, enjoy your beverage of choice, use their free wifi and crank out some work. You certainly won't have to bring headphones with you.
3) Crema Cafe
Crema has been serving Harvard students and local Cantabrigians for 7 years now, and from my experience, it has never failed to deliver. Their coffees are fantastic (especially the cappuccinos), though on the pricey side as far as coffee in the Square goes. The downstairs and outdoor seating areas seem to be more for socializing and meetings, but walk up the flight of stairs and you will be welcomed by a sea of Macbook Pros. Crema is one of the busier cafes in the area, so you will need some earphones if you’re going to be productive, but there’s definitely something to be said about the energy and vibe they have managed to create. I recommend it, that is if you can find a seat.
4) Algiers Coffee House
Originally solely a coffee house, this chic middle-eastern hangout has upped the ante over the last few years and now serves full meals as well as Middle Eastern bites. The exotic fusion teas, especially the mint, are delicious, and you can tuck into their signature falafel while cramming for a test, or use the upstairs area, which has especially good light, to crank out that paper. They play some Middle Eastern background music, and again, the energy of this place is top notch.
5) 1369 Coffee House (if you walk towards Central Square, it's on Mass Ave)
Jump on your bike and head down Mass Ave until you see blue neon lights and the most plain, white logo reading “1369 Coffee House”. The coffee and teas here are carefully prepared and pretty reasonably priced by local standards. When I walked in, I got the vibe that this place was made to be a Lamont away from Lamont. Each table, though accompanied by two chairs, is about big enough to fit a laptop, a textbook and a cup of coffee on. All you need to get through that work, no? If you head in at a relatively quiet hour, you may be lucky enough to get an elevated table, which comes with a lamp. The energy is sedated and peaceful, so I got the impression that this wasn’t a social space, rather a place for contemplation and essay planning. Definitely give it a try.
This list is by no means exhaustive but should give you a sense that there are many places beyond the Harvard microcosm that you can venture to for a bit of study. Try these with an open mind and hopefully you may discover your new favorite study spot.

The Crimson archive is a treasure trove chock full of fascinating articles. Since 1873, this newspaper has been reporting on events and issues that range from tremendously important to slightly bemusing. Let us go back in time and dig up some gems, shall we?
1911: “Hard Practice for 1915”
Just as it is today, Harvard football players were passionate about their sport more than a hundred years ago. This article is a synopsis of a football scrimmage in which “the Freshman football squad was given strenuous work.” Why was a freshman football practice reported on by the Crimson in 1911? Although the reason is wildly unclear, this article does provide some interesting insight into how athletic practices were run back in the day.
1940: “Folies Beauty Will Choose Mr. Harvard of 1940 Today”
This article publicizes some sort of beauty contest for Harvard men: “At the Pi Eta Club Andree Lorraine, alias Miss Paris, will watch undergraduate gentlemen strut about on a raised platform and pirouette slowly for the newsreels. She will measure shoulders, hips, and such with a tape.” Fashion shows and modeling were not reserved solely for women. Then comes the hard-hitting quote from Lorraine: “‘I zeemply adore Harvard men...I am glad to get away from those horrid Yale persons.’” Boom.
1965: “Harvard Applications Rise By 19% in ‘College Panic’”
