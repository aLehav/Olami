After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five months ago, President Barack Obama nominated Loretta E. Lynch ’81, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, to replace Eric Holder as United States attorney general. Instead of immediately calling for a debate and vote on her nomination, however, Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided to hold up a vote on her confirmation, demanding that the Senate first pass a human trafficking bill with a potential expansion of the controversial Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortions. McConnell’s decision to attach the outcome of a human trafficking bill to a vote on a nominee for attorney general is obstructionism at its worst.
More than 150 days after the announcement of Lynch's nomination, we are still waiting on a conformation vote in the Senate. On Tuesday, news broke of the deal that would bring up a vote. Republicans were able to claim that they did not expand federal funding of abortion while Democrats could claim that they did not allow abortion restrictions to increase.
This deal is a sign that compromise is still possible in the Senate, and in that sense it is laudable. But the amount of time it took to get to the point of holding a vote was unnecessary and a sign of the unfortunate state of lawmaking.  Obstructionism by both parties has become so common that the media speaks of the obstacles to Lynch’s nomination as if they were entirely unavoidable, even though they were immeasurable worsened by political brinksmanship over an unrelated and contentious issue. Moreover, the controversy over Lynch’s nomination is particularly ironic coming after Senator McConnell pledged that his time as majority leader would see an end to “gridlock and dysfunction.” This episode indicates that the Republican majority is simply content to continue business as usual.
Understanding exactly how the nomination process should work makes the delay in confirming Lynch even more infuriating. As with all nominations, the role of the Senate is to give "advice and consent." Tying a vote on a highly qualified nominee to a controversial abortion funding provision of a human trafficking bill is not advising the president on his nominee. The senator who has the power to determine which bills are considered should not refuse to entertain a qualified nominee for attorney general simply because of partisan rancor. At some point, deference to the Constitution’s separation of powers and to the needs of governance must supersede politics. Even prominent Republicans like potential presidential candidate Jeb Bush have called for the approval vote to take place.
In a perfect world, the deal that broke on Tuesday would be a sign that the two parties were ready to put aside politics on vital votes. But the delay in confirming even an eminently qualified nominee suggests that America’s once great deliberative chamber remains a place of partisan division, where compromise is a last resort and obstructionism a favored tactic. The American people deserve better from their Senate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a peer advisor for my concentration, I recently had the rare privilege of re-visiting the chaos of advising fortnight and concentration panels. If you’re well rounded, you’re stressed because marketable skills and Marx sound equally appetizing. If you’re less well rounded like I was, you’re stressed because you’re having trouble deciding between government, history, sociology, anthropology, economics and social studies.
So there I sat in the corner of the room during the social sciences panel, for the second time in my life. Most things were the same: Bad questions, fidgety kids, and it was definitely too long. The only difference was that this time around, I walked in with a slightly better understanding of what the words “discipline” and “multidisciplinary” mean, more or less.
And this is why what the History department representative said in her introduction to the audience struck me. Her opening line was something along these lines: “History is everything. The discipline is designed to be empathetic. That means putting yourself in somebody else’s shoes and ask why they did what they did.”
This is true. History in the broadest sense of the word is everything. It’s all people, all places, all actions, and all perspectives at all moments. That last period that I typed in that sentence you just read, that’s history in the broadest, non-capital-H sense of the word.
But capital-H History, the discipline History, is a bit different. Not all people, all places, all actions, and all perspectives at all moments are recorded. Sometimes, even if things are recorded, no one knows that the record exists or people don’t care that it exists. In the global circuit of power, some understandings of the world are faxed, copied, and distributed at the world’s best institutions to become what is “normal.” Others, meanwhile, are cast to the side as “political” understandings of this mainstream worldview.
At this point, we’ve all learned that our history classes in elementary school, no matter where you grew up, were at least a little bit screwed up. Columbus Day was my favorite day in the fifth grade because I had no idea that Christopher had played dirty with the people who were here before him. But this was what was conditioned to be normal, so when the class smarty in high school decided to “do Indigenous People’s Day” instead, people called him insightful, brave, and “standing up for what’s right.” An advocate.
Of course, in college, things thankfully aren’t so simplistic. But here at Harvard too, we seem to have concentrations that are considered “normal” and perhaps even “objective,” and those we consider to be the haven of the advocates. If you study sociology, government, anthropology, history, or economics, you’re a budding social scientist.
Meanwhile, it’s hard to tell whether people would grant the same privilege of normalcy to those who are in ethnic studies, African-American Studies, or Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. If you’re in one of those concentrations, you must really feel for the people you’re studying, right? These classrooms are silently understood to be a bit more political, political because you’re not reading the normal canon of dead European guys.
When we take a break from privileging some socially normalized ways of thinking and knowing over others, we see that all classrooms are political. The foundation of Sociology as we are introduced to it is formed by the works of Emile Durkheim, Karl Marx, and Max Weber. All three of these people come from approximately the same centimeter on the toy globe. Take a scroll through the History department’s course offerings. Isn’t it weird that we have a department called “the” History department when East Asian history and Near Eastern history are offered as subsets of other departments? The more we get used to the “normalcy” of our “normal” concentrations, the more political we are becoming.
The same rhetoric of “political” or “militant” has recently been applied to stigmatize some on-campus student movements like Divest’s Heat Week and Renegade Magazine. But these students, whether they are typing away the sorrows of micro aggressions or in front of University Hall with bandannas around their heads, are no more political than the very people who call them political.
Just like a concentration whose lineage traces back to a limited part of the globe produces inherently political classrooms, the “normal” or “general” magazine with a more or less homogenous staff publishes political material. At the end of the day, all of these things are privileging and propagating a certain opinion, no matter how well that opinion blends into the background.
This article isn’t about where you should stand on these issues. I don’t really care about that. I myself am a member of a concentration that dedicates a full year of study to Durkheim, Marx, Weber, and all of their friends and frenemies, and I am heavily involved with neither Divest nor Renegade. But wherever you stand and whether you like it or not, you too, like the orange-shirted people in the Yard and the black-and-white posters everywhere, are being political.

With just a handful of weeks before graduation, we seniors are becoming well aware of our changing roles—not just from students to alumni, but from kids with the privilege of taking in educational resources to adults with the capacity to give back. The college is realizing this too, and talk of the Senior Gift has begun to fill our dining halls and inboxes. Along with it comes a perennial question: To give, or not to give?  I’d like to expand this binary, so that we consider not only whether to give, but also in what ways and to which causes. I think that it matters how we answer these questions, and that we should give in a way that reflects our own values, not just the loudest requests of those around us.  The literature on alumni donations has found that past giving is the single strongest factor in predicting future giving, and that “encouraging [young alumni] to [donate], even in modest dollar amounts, may have significant life-time giving effects.” This is one reason why the Senior Gift Committee focuses more on participation than on amount raised; the significance of donating is not that we give enough to make an impact, but that we “enter into a tradition of giving back to future students.”   If indeed our decisions today influence our altruistic tendencies tomorrow, we should reevaluate their significance. We are not just shelling out $10 in the dining hall. Rather, we are forming habits which—like it or not—will affect the way we act on our values during the rest of our lives.  So, what habits do we want to form? If we want to give back to a world that has given us so much, we should start now—whether it means donating our money, volunteering our time, or raising our voices in advocacy. And since these decisions not only reflect our current values but also shape our future identities, we must make them ourselves.
It can be hard to make our own choices when our peers seem to have already declared the “right” decision. Whether it comes from friends or Senior Gift House reps, many of us will feel pressure to give. And there is nothing wrong with donating to Harvard—we may (and largely do) deeply appreciate the Harvard experience. But then we should give to Senior Gift on that basis, not because our friends told us to. After all, every donation we make is a donation we don’t make somewhere else.  For example, $10 to Harvard could contribute to a student’s financial aid; ten dollars is probably about the cost (if not value) of one meal in Annenberg. By comparison, donating those same $10 to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, an organization in sub-Saharan Africa that treats people with parasitic worms, would “deworm” about eight children, resolving intestinal issues, preventing organ damage, boosting test scores, and even increasing earnings later in life by upwards of 20 percent.
To me, this comparison is emotionally moving and morally compelling. Giving to SCI highlights values—of promoting human welfare and flourishing, regardless of nationality or alma mater—which are my core principles. Of course, they may not be yours, and I invite you to disagree with me. But these tradeoffs exist, and whether or not we acknowledge them, they are implicit in our decisions.
There are a multitude of ways to give back to the world, and the Senior Gift is one of them—but it is only one. If it best reflects your values, then support it; if not, then support the cause that does. Whatever decision you make, remember it is one which will shape your future actions, and in choosing who you will become, make sure to choose for yourself.

UPDATED: April 23, 2015, at 12:59 a.m.
Most admitted members of the Class of 2019 will not be allowed entrance into Yardfest on Friday, despite their revisit weekend beginning the next day.
According to Visitas director Timothy J. Smith '08, a former Crimson business editor, only admitted students who received permission based on religious or medical reasons to arrive a day early for Visitas will be allowed to attend the concert, which will be headlined by British pop artist Jessie J.
The Admissions Office only approved “a very small number” of admitted students to be allowed on campus a day early based on religious or medical reasons, Smith said. Those students will be given their Visitas identification cards early, giving them access to the annual spring concert for College students put on by the College Events Board, while the bulk of prospective students will not receive their cards until 7 a.m. Saturday morning when Visitas officially begins.
College Events Board Co-Chair Dakota D. Santana-Grace ’16 said the board had worked with the Admissions Office throughout the planning process and that “any prefrosh who had registered with Admissions will of course be allowed into Yardfest.” He noted that Yardfest has a large security presence compared to other campus events.
Visitas has not fallen on the same weekend as Yardfest since 2011, when headliner Far East Movement drew a crowd of around 7,000 to Tercentenary Theatre.
Smith did not respond to questions about whether there was a concern about prospective students consuming alcohol. The Visitas brochure distributed to admitted students contains the boldfaced reminder, “The legal drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 and the use of illicit drugs is a violation of University rules, as well as state and federal laws.”
With Jessie J as top billing, the two victors of Harvard’s Battle for Yardfest in March—self-proclaimed “middle school rock” group Black Tie Affair and soul band The Intrinsics—will open the concert.

Harvard named Boston banker Thomas J. Hollister the new chief financial officer and vice president for finance on Wednesday, concluding a months-long search for the new executive.
Hollister will replace Dan S. Shore, who announced he was stepping down in August to work at OnShape Inc., a technology start-up in Cambridge, as its CFO. Hollister will take the reins of Harvard’s administrative financial team during a University-wide $6.5 billion fundraising drive. The University announced the appointment in a press release Wednesday afternoon.
“It is an incredible privilege to join Harvard in this role, and I look forward to working with others across the institution to advance the University’s mission and its success,” Hollister said in a statement.
Responsible for the University’s financial administration, Hollister will work directly under Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, where he will oversee financial planning and reporting, and cash and debt management.
“I am thrilled that Tom is joining Harvard. We will benefit from his wealth of experience spanning all areas of finance—from capital markets, to banking and real estate,” Lapp said in a statement. “He is smart, strategic, and has likely faced every conceivable financial challenge.”
A graduate of Amherst College and Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, Hollister formerly served as the chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Global Partners LP, a Fortune 500 energy distribution company that is a “leader in the transportation of crude oil,” according to the company’s website.
Before that, he served as president of Citizens Bank of Massachusetts and then vice chairman of Citizens Financial Group.
Hollister has also held board positions at Tufts Medical Center and Wheaton College.
Not all welcome Hollister to his new position at Harvard. Following its week-long protest demanding that Harvard divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels, environmental activist group Divest Harvard condemned the appointment of Hollister for his role in the oil and gas business.
"Harvard's choice to hire Mr. Hollister highlights how this University continues to uphold the status quo that enables climate change and condones the fossil fuel industry,” Divest Harvard co-founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 wrote in a statement. “This action is inconsistent with the morals that we are taught in the classrooms of this University everyday."
University spokesperson Jeff Neal maintained, as has University President Drew G. Faust, that Harvard focuses its efforts on combating climate change through research and teaching. Neal wrote in a statement that Hollister was hired “due to his deep experience in all areas of finance, including more than 30 years in banking.”
Hollister starts in his new position in mid-May.

More than two months after receiving initial feedback on its Title IX procedures from the federal Office for Civil Rights, Harvard Law School has still not received final sign-off from OCR on its updated draft of those procedures, according to Law School spokesperson Robb London.
Even though it has not received final feedback, the Law School has begun implementing the new procedures.
As part of a resolution agreement signed by the Law School when it was found in violation of Title IX last year, the Law School submitted its new Title IX procedures—which break from Harvard’s central framework for responding to cases of alleged sexual harassment and were adopted in December—to OCR for feedback.
In February, the Law School received preliminary feedback from the federal office. At the time, London said the feedback called for minor changes that the Law School addressed in a new draft. The Law School then resubmitted their procedures for final review. Since then, without further OCR review, the Law School has started implementing the new procedures, and Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow appointed a Title IX committee, a body overseeing the Law School’s procedures.
The Law School adopted this set of Title IX procedures in December following pushback from Law School faculty members to Harvard’s central Title IX framework. Unveiled last summer, the then University-wide system for responding to cases of alleged sexual harassment created the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which conducts investigations into sexual misconduct.
Law School professors soon began to publicly criticize the centralized system, and Minow appointed a committee to create a set of school-specific procedures at the Law School. A group of 20 professors, all of whom signed an October open letter in the Boston Globe that railed against Harvard’s centralized system, also circulated a memo that called for the Law School to completely circumvent Harvard’s new ODR.
The Law School’s procedures differ significantly from Harvard’s centralized set; the Law School’s set hosts investigations through the school’s Title IX office, not ODR, and calls for attorneys to be provided to both parties in investigations.
The Law School’s break from the University Title IX system has sparked a broader debate over University governance, and two Law School professors published an op-ed in March that called for a University-wide faculty senate.
Law School students will be notified when the new procedures are implemented, according to a notice on the Law School website.

Vendors from in and around Cambridge, including the Little Free Library and Book Exchange, Hubway, and Next Step Living, set up shop on the Science Center Plaza on Wednesday afternoon to promote sustainable living.
The Harvard Sustainability Fair was created out of a partnership between the Harvard Office of Sustainability, the Common Spaces Initiative, and Harvard University Dining Services. Hundreds of students, faculty members, and Cantabrigians passed through the fair, which was put on to celebrate Earth Day.
“It’s open to the community,” Residential Program Coordinator for the Office of Sustainability Kelsey V. Grab said, noting that the event was part of the Cambridge Science Festival. “All of Cambridge is invited.”
Many of HUDS’ local suppliers set up booths and distributed free samples.
“It’s tough for HUDS to show people what they do... to show people that we buy locally,” said Grab. “[The fair is] an opportunity for people to see that.”
The fair featured a booth by Backyard Farms, the 42-acre greenhouse in Madison, Maine from which HUDS purchases its tomatoes.
After having tried the tomatoes, Patrick T. Hansen ’18 was complimentary. But he was surprised to hear that they were among HUDS’ produce purchases.
“Those tomatoes are in the d-hall?” he asked.
Crista Martin, a HUDS spokesperson, said that the dining halls are looking to expand their sourcing of local foods, although it is difficult since the majority of the school year occurs outside the peak of New England’s growing season.
“We are looking at all the ways we can use local food in the dining hall,” Martin said.
She added that, since HUDS cannot buy as much local produce as it would like, the dining halls instead buy local products.
Martin gave the examples of Teddie’s Organic Peanut Butter and Lily’s Pasta.
“Clearly, the wheat’s not grown here, but they are making the pasta and ravioli and gnocchi you eat in the dining hall,” Martin said. “Teddie’s peanut butter—they aren’t growing the peanuts here but they are grinding it.”

Attorneys from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights are soliciting student input on sexual violence on Harvard’s campus this week as part of the government’s nearly year-long investigation into the College’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
OCR interviewed students on Wednesday and plans to continue meeting with students on Thursday, according to a Doodle poll initiated by Olga Benjamin, OCR’s lead investigator for the case.
Since they opened an investigation into the College’s Title IX adherence last April in response to a complaint filed by student activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better, investigators have met with members of the group and visited campus last fall.
OCR’s move to interview students on campus represents the most known and visible attempt by the government to garner broad student feedback as part of the investigation, according to Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better. She and Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, who is also an organizer for the group, said they have interacted with OCR investigators on multiple occasions.
According to Denise Horn, an assistant press secretary at the Department of Education, OCR typically gathers information through different avenues over the course of an investigation, including on campus interviews. In an emailed statement, Horn added that investigators can hold focus group discussions or office hours for individual interviews.
“The purpose of these sessions is to gather information relevant to OCR’s investigation and its assessment of the school’s compliance with civil rights laws,” Horn wrote.
Both administrators and members of Our Harvard Can Do Better have publicized OCR’s two-day visit this week, emphasizing in communications with students that it is important that their opinions and experiences are incorporated in the investigation. The visit also coincides with Harvard’s ongoing sexual conduct climate survey, a separate measure to garner student feedback on sexual violence on campus that opened more than a week ago.
“Talking to students is consistently a thing that they’ve said they’re most interested in,” Fox-Penner said, referring to OCR’s investigators. Fournier said she had provided OCR with the names of various student groups she recommended they interview.
In an email to undergraduates on Monday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana informed students of OCR’s upcoming presence on campus and gave them Benjamin’s email.
Benjamin did not respond to a request for comment, but another OCR attorney, Elizabeth Bagdon, referred The Crimson to an Education Department spokesperson.
According to Alicia Oeser, the director of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, her office has not yet been contacted by OCR. Oeser said “that is expected” in large part because of OSAPR’s confidentiality policies.
Oeser said she passed along information about OCR’s visit to two student groups affiliated with her office, Consent Assault Awareness and Relationship Educators and RESPONSE peer counselors.
“We make sure our student groups have that info,” Oeser said. “It is something that we want to be communicated to people.”
Fox-Penner said she hopes OCR will closely examine the transparency of the College’s Administrative Board, the disciplinary body that hands down sanctions in sexual assault cases, while Fournier said she hopes the College will incorporate mandatory Title IX training for all undergraduates. Both students said they are optimistic that OCR will respond to students’ feedback.
“I think this Office [for] Civil Rights is listening to students and does care what they have to say, and will take that into account when they make their recommendations,” Fournier said.
In December, OCR concluded another Title IX investigation at Harvard Law School, which they found in violation of the law. In the wake of that decision, experts predicted that the College, in its own investigation, would face increased scrutiny.
Harvard has dramatically restructured the way it investigates sexual assault complaints since last spring when the College investigation opened—the University has since implemented a new Title IX policy—but debate surrounding the issue remains. Law School professors have balked at the policy, and the new centralized office tasked with investigating student sexual harassment complaints across the University still remains understaffed.
Fournier and Fox-Penner said OCR has not provided them with a specific timeline for the ongoing investigation.

The new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration has started the process of hiring faculty members, said Martin Puchner, the English professor who spearheaded the effort to create the concentration, during a panel event Wednesday.
Students, faculty, and members of Harvard’s arts and theater community met for a panel discussion on the new concentration, discussing the growth of the program, the role of technical theater training, and the concentration’s relationship with other theater organizations on campus.
Puchner said during the event that various academic departments across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will hire new professors to teach in the concentration, and the committee will hire lecturers.
“We are going to have 4 or 5 people coming next year to offer courses, and we will continue to do that and to grow that and maybe turn some of these, what’s right now visiting positions into longer-term positions,” Puchner said.
Those involved in running the program—including employees from the Office for the Arts and the American Repertory Theater and the president of the undergraduate theater umbrella organization, Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club—answered questions from prospective concentrators at the panel.
First announced in October 2014, a concentration in Theatre, Dance, and Media was officially approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences earlier this month. A standing committee will be created on July 1 to run the concentration, and students will be able to declare in the concentration starting next fall.
The panel also discussed the new program’s relationship with the already-established theater community on campus. One of the requirements of the concentration is participation in four productions, two of which must be affiliated with the concentration.
Though both concentrators and non-concentrators will be able to participate in the Theater, Dance, and Media productions, Magdalene M.  Zier ’16, the president of HRDC, said there are some concerns about sharing resources between the ever-higher number of on-campus productions.
“I think there are some practicalities to be worked out in terms of shared resources and just general logistics to make sure that HRDC and the concentration don’t get relegated to opposite ends of the campus, but that we continue to work together to make theater even better and more exciting on campus.”
Prospective concentrators at the event said they are looking forward to seeing how the Theater, Dance, and Media program will develop in the coming years.
“With a concentration comes more support from the University to put on more shows, so more opportunities there as well,” said Derek P. Speedy ’18.

FOCUS Foods Inc. and RapidSOS each won grand prizes of $50,000 at the Harvard Business School’s New Venture Competition on Wednesday, an annual competition that financially supports University students and alumni launching new businesses.
According to their presentations, RapidSOS seeks to commercialize technologies to improve emergency response and communication, and FOCUS Foods Inc. aims to create a prototype for self-sustaining aquaponics farms—a food production system that grows fish and plants together—to be built on supermarket roofs.
With cash prizes and in-kind services totalling more than $300,000, the NVC granted awards to competitors divided into a social enterprise group and a business track group. While the grand prize winning team in each category received $50,000, runner ups were awarded $25,000.
“We are in the business of educating leaders that will change the world,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said at the event. “Entrepreneurship is something that you inspire.”
Alluding to ABC show “Shark Tank,” a reality television competition that similarly awards investments to promising business ventures, and “Saturday Night Live,” the NVC opened with a comedic theme that continued throughout the show of a female protagonist presenting unsound business ideas, such as a bed for your iPhone to sleep in.
Peggy Yu, associate director for the Rock Center for Entrepreneurship, which co-sponsored the event along with the Social Enterprise Initiative, said that 122 judges whittled the list of 300 teams down to 11 teams present at the event.
“Today is a celebration of taking a simple idea and making it into a big venture,” Yu said.
In addition to the competition for students, the Business School encouraged alumni to participate in one of the 14 NVCs hosted by 17 HBS alumni “hub” locations. The winners of each regional competition are then invited to attend the NVC finale event on the Business School’s campus. Alumni groups StreetShares, a financial technology project, Eve & Tribe, a clothing company, and BollyX Fitness, a Bollywood-dance inspired fitness program, received awards.
Attendee and Boston resident Amanda Linn said she attends the NVC every year.
“It’s refreshing to see young people coming up with creative ideas to solve important problems,” Linn said.

Men’s Golf:
Coming off a successful weekend in which they finished sixth out of 14 schools at the Yale Spring Invitation, the Harvard men’s golf team heads to Bethlehem, Pa. for the Ivy Championships this weekend. The Crimson finished second among Ancient Eight competitors at Yale, finishing only a stroke behind the Bulldogs.  Last year, Harvard finished third behind Yale and champion Columbia. A win for the Crimson would give them their first Ivy League Championship since 1974 and earn them an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
Baseball:
The Crimson baseball squad (18-20, 7-9 Ivy) closes out its season with a pair of doubleheaders against Dartmouth (16-19, 12-4) this weekend. Earlier today, Harvard suffered a 7-6 loss at the hands of Northeastern in the Beanpot consolation game at Fenway Park. Saturday’s games will take place in Hanover, N.H. while Sunday’s contests will be at home for Harvard. Despite having been eliminated from playoff contention, the Crimson has the chance to finish above .500 for the first time since 2006.
Softball:
Like their baseball counterparts, the Harvard softball contingent (21-19, 11-5 Ivy) plays two doubleheaders against Dartmouth (21-14, 14-2) this weekend. But for the women, the series still have postseason implications. The Crimson currently sit three games behind the Big Green, meaning a four-game sweep would give it the North Division title. A division title would send Harvard to the best-of-three Ivy League Championship Series against the South Division winners.
Men’s Volleyball:
On Sunday, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (12-11, 6-5 EIVA) will close out its slate of regular season games with a home matchup versus Sacred Heart (12-12, 3-8). The Pioneers are in a tie with NJIT for the EIVA cellar. The Crimson come into this one having defeated George Mason, 3-1, last Friday. This will be its last contest before the EIVA Championships, which will determine whether or not the team progresses to the NCAA tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­BOSTON—Wednesday afternoon was a dream come true for two Harvard baseball players from Massachusetts. Senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan and freshman right fielder Conor Quinn both hit two-run home runs over the Green Monster at legendary Fenway Park, but the four runs proved not to be enough as the Crimson fell to Northeastern, 7-6.
“It was an exciting experience,” McGuiggan said. “To be able to come out here and cap off my senior year with that was nice. That’s a good memory and I’m happy I got the opportunity to be in there after missing the last nine games.”
After the Huskies tied the contest in the top of the eighth, freshman shortstop Maxwell Burt led off the Northeastern ninth with a single.
Sophomore Nick Gruener and junior Nick Schahill combined to get the next two outs, but Huskies first baseman Cam Hanley singled home Burt to give Northeastern the lead for good.
With the win, the Huskies (17-22 overall, 7-5 Colonial Athletic Association) took third place in the Beanpot, an annual two-round tournament between Harvard, Northeastern, Boston College, and UMass. This was the first time the second round games have been played at Fenway Park since 2013. The Crimson (18-20, 7-9 Ivy League) took home the crown last season with a win at Friedman Diamond in Brookline.
Junior Shaun Rubin got a much-deserved start for Harvard. The lefty had command issues in the first and gave up a run after a single to Huskies centerfielder Michael Foster and three wild pitches. However, McGuiggan put the Crimson up 2-1 with his third home run of the season.
Playing in the Beanpot took on special meaning for the Hingham, Mass. native, who has battled injuries all season. The senior started at designated hitter and saw his first game action since pulling his hamstring April 11 at Brown.
“I think it’s been great for Jake,” Harvard coach Bill Decker said. “The think about Jake is he’s got his teammates pulling for him. He’s been one of our leaders offensively. I’m real happy for him.”
Northeastern tagged junior Matt Sanders and freshman Garrett Rupp for three runs, but Harvard reclaimed the lead in the fourth as Quinn took Nate Borges yard for the first home run of his collegiate career. The freshman from Amherst, Mass. had a slow start to the season but is hitting .413 in his last 13 games. Freshman John Fallon, a lifelong Red Sox fan, picked up a go-ahead RBI in his Fenway debut.
“They keep on growing, they’re young,” Decker said. “They’ve got a lot of innings under their belt, seasoned as freshmen. They came up big for us. We can count on those guys one through nine.”
A diving catch by Foster on a liner by McGuiggan in the fourth saved two runs and kept the game tied. Freshman Ian Miller and junior T.J. Laurisch combined to give the Crimson the shutdown performance it needed from the bullpen. The duo combined to throw three innings and did not surrender a hit.
Despite only throwing 11 pitches in the seventh, Laurisch was replaced by Gruener the following inning. One of Harvard’s top starters, Gruener had not made an appearance out of the bullpen this season.
After the Huskies tied the game when an errant throw home from Quinn got past both sophomore cutoff-man Matt Hink and senior catcher Ethan Ferreira and into the backstop, senior Mike Martin ended the Northeastern threat by throwing a dart from center field to nail Joey Scambia at third.
The Crimson went quietly in the eighth after Burt threw out freshman third baseman John Fallon trying to advance to third, and despite hits from Ferreira and junior infielder Mitch Klug, Harvard could not push the tying run across in the ninth. The offense had 17 hits on the day but did not score after the fifth and posted just four singles in the game’s final four frames.
Huskies sophomore Aaron Civale got Hink to roll over a pitch in the ninth to pick his fifth save and salvage the win for Northeastern. John Amendola picked up a well-deserved win. The freshman threw four scoreless innings and only surrendered three hits.
“We definitely left a lot of runners in scoring position,” McGuiggan said. “We didn’t capitalize on a lot of offensive situations later in the game. At the same time, I think we can really build on our offensive showing today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men and women’s golf teams will be travelling to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for the Ivy League Golf Championship this weekend. Having performed well in their recent tournaments these past few weeks, both squads are serious contenders for the championship.
MEN’S GOLF
The Crimson placed among the top six in all three of their tournaments this spring. Notching fifth out of 14 teams in their first tournament in March at the Seahawk Intercollegiate set the tone for what would be a succession of solid tournament performances. At the Met Intercollegiate Harvard placed third out of nine and finally finished in sixth place out of 14 at the Yale Invitational.
“Our season has been going really well,’ junior Rohan Ramnath said. “We’ve been building up to Ivies for about a month now. As everyone knows, the winter was a little bit harsh this year so it was difficult for us to prepare for our early tournaments, but we’ve made a lot of progress since the beginning of March.”
The Crimson entered last year’s Ivy League Championship as a favorite, but exited with a third place finish. However, Harvard has notched victories against last year’s champions Columbia and rival Yale. It will be the second seed in the tournament this year.
The team placed higher than Yale in the Met Intercollegiate and was three spots ahead of Columbia at the Seahawk Intercollegiate. Harvard lost the fifth place position in the Yale Spring Invitational to Yale by one shot. However, because the tournament contained five top-40 teams, the sixth place victory was an impressive one.
“Our game plan is to treat [the Ivies] just like any other tournament,” Ramnath said. “Treating it differently adds pressure and we don’t need that. We stack up really well against the other teams, and we’re just going to have go out there and give it our best.”
WOMEN’S GOLF
This year, the Crimson will be arriving at the Saucon Valley Country Club as the winner of the Ivy League Championship for three years in a row. Having beat four nationally ranked teams at the Silverado Showdown in California earlier this month, the Crimson is in a promising position for this weekend.
Having similarly struggled with the lack of outdoor practice time in the winter, the Crimson cites its tournament experience as an advantage.
“It was difficult getting outside and getting as many reps that we wanted to,” captain Tiffany Lim said. “The tournaments have been really useful, especially the competition setting in places with really nice weather. We did well at those tournaments, which was a plus. It’s giving us a lot of confidence heading into Ivies.”
Despite being ranked three positions higher than Columbia in the Division rankings, Harvard is seeded third behind Yale and Columbia.
“We don’t necessarily focus on rankings or star players or things like that,” said Lim. “We do trust that everybody out there is doing their best individually.”
The team effort has been enhanced by the performance of sophomore Anne Cheng. The only player from the Crimson seeded in the top five, Cheng’s fifth place finish at the Silverado Showdown lifted the team to a top five result. Harvard was only two strokes behind Silverado Showdown third place winner, Colorado, and only four strokes behind first-place University of Oregon.
“When we’re out on the course we know we need to rely on each other,” Lim said. “Everybody on the team could win at any time and everybody can be star. ”
The depth and versatility of the team is also cited as a strong suit of the men’s team.“From one to five, any one of us could be the player this week,” Ramnath said. “That’s what really sets us apart from the other teams [in the Ivy League].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (7-7, 3-3 Ivy League) came up with a decisive 12-1 victory against UMass Lowell (0-16) on its home turf Tuesday night to even its record to .500 heading into the end of regular season play. Capitalizing on an 8-0 run that spanned well into the second half, the Crimson showed the River Hawk squad it has a lot to learn in its inaugural season.
Nine Harvard players found the back of the net, demonstrating the team’s versatility against the less experienced UMass Lowell offense. The scoring was led by junior co-captain midfielder Audrey Todd and freshman midfielders Julia Glynn and Eliza Guild, who all two goals apiece.
“We were all challenging hard to cage, moving the ball quickly, looking for cutters and working for good opportunities,” Todd said. “We played as a unit and stayed in structure and that allowed everyone to be a threat and get involved.”
The River Hawks’ lone goal came midway through the second period, when freshman attack Jesse Jay fed to fellow freshman midfielder Taylor Sokol. UMass Lowell only registered seven shots for the game, four of which were on goal. Harvard, on the other hand, registered 39 shots throughout the match.
“I think we head into every game with a similar mindset,” Todd said. “We never go in thinking we are better or worse than our opponent, just that we are as good as them. Then, when the game starts, we try to set the tempo from the get-go and prove we are there to play. If we manage to get a big lead, like we did today, then we try and work on some things and use the game as an opportunity to get better.”
The Crimson edged out the River Hawks in most areas of the box score, winning the ground ball battle, 26-18, while committing 13 fewer turnovers. Sophomore defender Marina Burke led the defensive end with a team-high five caused turnovers, while junior co-captain defender Tory Waldstein chipped in three of her own.
In addition to leading the team in ground balls, with five each, the defenders also tallied the final two goals of the match. In the final four minutes, Burke recorded her second goal of the season.
Sophomore defender Michelle Nesselbush also had a strong game on defense, picking up three ground balls and forcing a late UMass Lowell turnover.
“Going into today’s game, we definitely wanted to be really aggressive on defense,” Waldstein said. “We wanted to really pressure out and see if we could cause turnovers. We were able to cause all sorts of turnovers, mostly checks and a few interceptions.”
Despite the virtually one-sided scoring match, the two teams were neck-and-neck in draw controls, 7-7. The River Hawks had 28 turnovers, however, allowing Harvard to create more offensive opportunities.
Three Crimson goalies saw the field, with junior co-captain Kelly Weis starting the first half. Weis registered one save before freshman goalie Meredith Brown headed into the cage after halftime. Brown recorded two saves and allowed the single goal against. The other freshman goalie, Olivia Gundrum, guarded the goal for an eventless final 14 minutes of the match.
Although Harvard put up 12 goals against UMass Lowell goalie Courtney Barrett, the freshman ended the day with a .520 save percentage after stopping 13 Crimson attempts.
“There were a lot of good things coming out of this game,” Waldstein said.
The win will give Harvard momentum heading into the team’s home match against Yale Saturday
.“I think that we have improved on both sides of the ball over the course of the season,” Todd said. “Back in February and March, we had a tendency to play as individuals and that cost us a few games we maybe could have won. Now, though, we are playing as a cohesive team and that will definitely help us as we head into Saturday - and hopefully the postseason.”
