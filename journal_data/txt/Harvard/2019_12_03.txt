If you think the GRAMMY nominations came early this year — last Wednesday, Nov. 20, that is — you’re right. The 2019 GRAMMY nominees were announced on Dec. 7 in 2018, but after the Oscars decided to move up their telecast to Feb. 9, 2020, the Recording Academy also decided to move up its ceremony to Jan. 26 — a sharp break from its tradition of holding the GRAMMY ceremony in February.
If there’s one (big) takeaway from Wednesday’s announcement, it’s that new artists are giving the old guard a run for its money. Lizzo, 2019’s breakout star, received the most (eight) nominations. Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X weren’t far behind, either, each receiving six nominations, the second-most among all nominated artists.
Here are a few notable snubs, surprises, and oddities among this year’s GRAMMY nominations in the “Big Four” categories.
Record of the Year
“Hey, Ma” — Bon Iver
“Bad Guy” — Billie Eilish
“7 Rings” — Ariana Grande
“Hard Place” — H.E.R.
“Talk” — Khalid
“Old Town Road” — Lil Nax X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus
“Truth Hurts” — Lizzo
“Sunflower” — Post Malone & Swae Lee
Not going to lie, the nominations in this category are pretty representative of 2019’s biggest hits, though it’s unlikely that many people are particularly familiar with either Bon Iver’s “Hey, Ma” or H.E.R.’s “Hard Place.” Although Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello’s “Senorita” was cruelly overplayed on the radio, it was a song that defined the summer of 2019, so it would have been nice to see it recognized. Halsey’s “Without Me” was also one of the biggest songs of 2019, let alone the past decade, and it’s a shame that the GRAMMYs continues to snub Halsey year after year.
Album of the Year
“I, I” — Bon Iver
“Norman F****** Rockwell” — Lana Del Rey
“When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” — Billie Eilish
“Thank U, Next” — Ariana Grande
“I Used to Know Her” — H.E.R.
“7” — Lil Nas X
“Cuz I Love You (Deluxe)’ — Lizzo
“Father of the Bride” — Vampire Weekend
Let’s get straight to the point: Lil Nas X’s “7”should not have been nominated for the most prestigious award category at the GRAMMYs. While it is obvious that the GRAMMYs are trying to keep up with the times, “7” is a half-assed and unfocused piece of work. It’s also JUST AN EP! The saddest thing about “7” being nominated for Album of the Year is that it could have easily been replaced with Taylor Swift’s “Lover.” Have the GRAMMY voters never listened to the bop that is “Cruel Summer”? Despite this, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Lizzo put out some of the best albums of 2019, so kudos to the Recording Academy for recognizing them.
Song of the Year
“Always Remember Us This Way” — Lady Gaga
“Bad Guy” — Billie Eilish
“Bring My Flowers Now” — Brandi Carlile
“Hard Place” — H.E.R.
“Lover” — Taylor Swift
“Norman F****** Rockwell” — Lana Del Rey
“Someone You Loved” — Lewis Capaldi
“Truth Hurts” — Lizzo
YASS, there was some love for “A Star Is Born.” The “A Star Is Born” soundtrack was also brutally snubbed from the Album of the Year category. And yay for Taylor Swift’s “Lover” getting a spot in this category; “Lover” is one of Swift’s best songs to date, and most definitely a return to the old Taylor. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Lewis Capaldi’s “Someone You Loved” get nominated for Song of the Year, given its recent growing popularity.
Best New Artist
Black Pumas
Billie Eilish
Lil Nax X
Lizzo
Maggie Rogers
Rosalía
Tank and the Bangas
Yola
Sorry to all the other nominees, but this race is between Billie Eilish and Lizzo. Some people are mad that Lizzo is getting nominated for “Best New Artist” for work she put out three years ago, but is it her fault that we caught on to her greatness too late? No! Lizzo is 100 percent that b****! A notable omission in this category is Megan Thee Stallion, who put out an absolute banger this year with “Hot Girl Summer.” That said, the Recording Academy did nominate Maggie Rogers, so at least there’s that! Go stream “Heard It in a Past Life” right now!
If one thing is clear with the GRAMMY nominations, it’s that the best new artists of 2019 have come to play — and win. It should make for an interesting show come January.

Everyone who wanted to hear Harry Styles say “getting railed to death” on live TV got their wish last weekend. Delivered in an American accent nearly as sexy as his British one, Styles’ played the role of an intern caught leaving sexually explicit messages via the Sara Lee Instagram account. Sara Lee, for the uninitiated, is a bread company known for “its delicious baked goods,” according to the company’s actual Instagram bio. It’s not hard to see why the Internet blew up.
The sketch recounts the talking-to that Styles’ character receives — mostly in response to his thirsty comments on Nick Jonas’ Instagram account, but also his laments about failed threesomes that end up as captions for Sara Lee’s own posts. Notably, he doesn’t show remorse, which is understandable: After all, his character never achieved his dream of getting railed by a “random guy with only 200 followers,” and has to grapple with said failed threesomes. Are there any better coping mechanisms than this?
The actual, real-life Sara Lee Instagram account had to disable comments because people began to flood the account with the same emojis used in the skit — it looks like they’re back now, even though people are showing no signs of withholding their thirsty comments.
There are, of course, a few reasons underlying this latest viral hit. First, it’s an excellent example of the correct way to make homosexuality the centerpiece of comedy without making it the butt of the joke. Finally! Comedy writers, take note: Skit writers Bowen Yang and Julio Torres show that it’s possible to develop a skit about being gay without being mocking and derisive.
Second, Harry Styles is the centerpiece of the nearly four-minute skit. Fans who loved him when he sang “What Makes You Beautiful” back in 2011 are now eight years older: They’re now ready to see, and delight in, the spectacle that is Styles’ unabashed acknowledgements — even if it’s only when acting out a corduroy-clad caricature — that he is both thirsty and dealing with the universal miseries of rejection.
Virality is a curious thing: Much of it is attributable to Twitter, and this video is no exception. People who had never understood Styles’ appeal found themselves descending a YouTube rabbit hole, while others merely marveled at the skit’s genius. The video has all the perfect elements: brevity, relatability, and some element of never-been-seen-before. It will be an integral part of a not-yet-emergent field of studies devoted to memes, Internet culture, and how they both proliferate. Ten years from now, if people dig up the video again, it will still be a hit, with the eggplant, train, and ghost emojis front and center.

On Nov. 19, local journalist-turned-carpenter-turned-author Nina MacLaughlin read three stories from her fiction debut, “Wake, Siren: Ovid Resung” at the Harvard Book Store. The book had been released earlier that day.
MacLaughlin’s foray into fiction follows her memoir “Hammer Head: The Making of a Carpenter,” which recounts her abrupt transition from office life to woodworking. She admitted, though, that “Wake, Siren” is still her most personal book to date. “I wrote a true book about my life, and this in some ways feels more revealing,” MacLaughlin said. “It’s like, ‘Here’s my bizzare-o imagination.’”
Like all the stories in the book, the three MacLaughlin shared with the bookstore audience — “Pygmalion,” “Callisto,” and “Echo” — retell the Greek mythological tales of transformation recounted in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses.” For example, in “Callisto,” the vow-breaking seductress turned into a bear for her indiscretion with Zeus becomes a traumatized rape victim haunted by violent memories even after becoming a constellation. MacLaughlin read in her protagonist’s voice: “I stay and burn and will stay and burn.”
“Callisto,” which MacLaughlin began as part of an exercise she hoped might break a writer’s block, was the first story she wrote for the collection. After that, “it just came and came and came,” she said. Unlike the prolonged editing process she described for “Hammer Head,” including seven rounds of start-to-finish rewriting, this book’s development was rapid. (After all, her most recent book’s publication was only three years ago.) “In some ways, it was a little bit frightening in that unleashing,” she said.
MacLaughlin’s local fan base, formed in the wake of her memoir’s publication, was out in force to hear her new work. Some of them were surprised by their first taste of “Wake, Siren.” “It’s the last thing I expected, having only known ‘Hammer Head,’” Justice Andrew R. Grainger ’69 said. “When she started reading, I thought to myself, ‘I didn’t know this was a book of poetry.’”
Though in a factual sense the collection’s poetic voice is shaped into prose, other listeners echoed Granger’s acknowledgement of its richness, especially as compared to MacLaughlin’s previous work. “‘Hammer Head’ was self-deprecating, funny, wry — and moving, but in a way more mundane way than this. This is extravagant,” Jean L.D. Hay, a local resident, said.
The audience members, many of whom MacLaughlin greeted by name when they raised their hands to ask questions, also appreciated the way her words sounded when she read them aloud. “I loved hearing your voice!” exclaimed one listener, to general murmurs of assent. “I don’t do audiobooks, but I think I’m going to wait.”
MacLaughlin, on the other hand, responded by revealing her apprehension about recording the audiobook, which she will be reading. “It’s a pretty dark and violent book, and so the idea of reading it out loud, the entire thing, cover to cover — I need to gird myself for those days coming up soon,” she said.
But despite the darkness of “Wake, Siren,” or maybe because of it, audience members appreciated the book’s vividness. “Nina has a great eye and ear and mind for the details, and the stories that they tell, and she meticulously records them and weaves them together beautifully,” Peter H. Nersesian, her friend, said.
And for a few listeners, MacLaughlin may have incited a new passion: “It may even inspire me to read the ‘Metamorphoses’!” Kathleen C. Stone, founder and co-host of the literary salon Booklab, said.

Harry Styles recently made his debut in the coveted spot of SNL host — doing double duty, in fact, as both host and musical guest. His episode included skits about Sara Lee (yes, the bread company), impeachment, airline pilots, a childbirth class, and more. Beyond his dry humor, Styles, as expected, donned several spectacular outfits for the show: This time, the repertoire included a full tutu and tights for the promotional photoshoot. Styles’ style has always been a point of controversy and a highly discussed topic — but this particular photoshoot is a departure from his usual flamboyant style.
Styles’ photos, which both he and Saturday Night Live posted on their respective Instagrams, showed the singer posed with champagne glass in hand and cigarette clamped between his pouty lips.
Though it seems dramatic to call it appropriation, that is essentially what these photos feel like to the ballet community. Popular use of ballet aesthetics almost never comes from a place of genuine respect and wanting to represent the art form truthfully. Rather, it often stems from a caricature of the hyper-traditional, classical, and uptight image people tend to have about ballet and ballerinas — prim, proper, and conservative.
Styles, though garbed in a legitimate tutu, is not so convincing in his poses, even for a still photo. He clearly has no knowledge of dance, and shows no regard for representing it in a respectful way either.
And it isn’t the fact that Styles is male presenting, either. There are, in fact, men who wear tutus and pointe shoes — Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo is a world-renowned example — but they are professionally trained and incredibly talented dancers with extensive backgrounds in the art form. They have the creative agency to create comedic ballets with the awareness and care for the history of ballet that such work requires.
Styles is not the only celebrity to have appropriated the art form. In 2016, Kendall Jenner’s photoshoot with Vogue featured the model prancing around a ballet studio wearing pointe shoes that she clearly has no idea how to wear — and the ballet world blew its top. Reactions pointed out that “Ballet dancers don’t train 7+ hours a day, 7 days a week, to be represented by Kendall Jenner and her dodgy feet…” (This tweet has since been deleted.)
Even the notorious Abby Lee Miller of “Dance Moms” commented on the shoot on Instagram, writing, “… I cannot be a fan of this shoot. There are so many amazing dancers in the world… Kendall Jenner is not one of them!”
As Miller and many others pointed out: Why not use a real, trained ballerina? Ballet dancers hold no issue with promoting the ballet art in popular culture, but celebrities with no real dance background misrepresenting the art form is simply disrespectful.
Though, as some have pointed out, “It’s not that deep” — and though appropriating ballet is nowhere near as serious as cultural appropriation, it is demeaning to see Styles or Jenner in a tutu, posed in such a way that could be read as mocking to ballet as an art form. This free use of ballet aesthetics with no education about the history and even the reality of the work ignores and belittles the immense hard work and talent that ballet requires. There is no awareness or respect of the ballet world and its lengthy history and many traditions among celebrities who put on tutus and pointe shoes for entertainment purposes. Even as a ballet student, I remember not being given a proper pancake tutu until I was much older, with many years of training under my belt. If Styles, or anyone else, wants to put on a tutu, they should put in the hours of work to earn that right.

In this new video for the song “Tusa,” Karol G appears first in the middle of a Greek column circle surrounded by dancers. The natural sunlight in this scene makes Karol G appear radiant, and the dancer’s voguing hands with their long nails surround her like sunbeams. Meanwhile, Nicki hangs out inside a mansion with her iconic PINK opulent aesthetic. 30 seconds in, and I had already texted all my friends in all caps ABOUT THIS GEM.
“¿Qué pasó contigo?” Nicki Minaj rapping in Spanish is the content I live for. After Nicki finishes her solo, Karol G starts the chorus in Spanish and Nicki lip syncs at the beginning, nodding her head side to side.
Karol G was born in Medellín, Antioquia (shout out to my hometown!), fertile tropical mountains for urban artists, and city of eternal spring. Karol G’s chorus in this song is highly romantic. “Tusa” is a very Colombian word, specially used in the coasts and in Antioquia, which describes that state when your relationship is over and you feel down. Most people in Colombia use it; it’s a socially acceptable way to speak this feeling into existence. It’s not that you are necessarily sad — it’s just that you miss them. It’s a feeling of longing, of wanting that unattainable love. This song is all about feeling. Strings in the background play a sweet melody while the beat still allows for a great night of perreo (read: “reggaeton grinding”).
This is a theme in the latest reggaeton coming from Latin America. Maluma, Wolfine, J Balvin, Farina, Karol G, even Kali Uchis have been drifting the content of the urban genres away from the superficial misogynistic content of the past, and zoning in, even if only a little bit, on the more emotional and intimate. Even though it’s still mostly about clubbing, they’re being a little honest now. We are still going to the club, but why deny that someone is circling our minds while we are dancing?
Karol G sings about this girl who is going out tonight. She's trying to dance her tusa away. “Si le ponen la canción le da una depresion tonta” (If they play her the song, she gets a dumb depression”). “LA CANCIÓN” is a clear reference to the song by J Balvin and Bad Bunny, which also follows this wonderfully melancholic theme. Karol G tells us that this girl is trying to cure herself by going out to a party — “ella se cura con rumba.” She is trying to forget. She can hardly feel anything now, using other men as he did with her. But then, when she is finally at the club she can’t help but think of him. The entire video shows something different. Everything is super dreamy. The jewels (on them, on the walls, on the table), the Greek statues, the lighting, their stunning dresses (all five of them!), the pegasuses (pegasi?). We are seeing life through pink lenses even though they are singing about a tusa.
And that’s the whole point — we are still in love.

You want to be a writer, you say? Well, you’ve come to the right place. I know exactly how to get those creative juices flowing. And before you even ask, yes, I am perfectly qualified to tell you, dear reader, how to become the stellar writer you were always meant to be. If you know me, you’ve probably heard I’ve written for Entertainment Weekly and, of course, The Harvard Crimson. One time, a high schooler even emailed me asking for my credentials so they could put it in their annotated bibliography. I’m that big of a deal. So you’re going to want to pay attention and remember these five things that should inspire and enlighten you (and if they don’t, that’s a you problem).
“The Goldfinch” by Donna Tartt
“The Goldfinch” by Donna Tartt
Nothing says art like art about other art. Once you slowly crawl yourself out of the deep hole of despair you have dug into while reading over 700 pages of this heart-wrenching novel, go back and look at the passages describing the painting at the heart of the story. Also, Boris. Every book ever should be about Boris.
“A Game of Thrones” by George R. R. Martin
“A Game of Thrones” by George R. R. Martin
In case you haven’t noticed, people like sex and violence (and also incest, apparently). But not just any old violence or sex will do. Martin managed to make some of the most questionable narratorial decisions and still had millions of fans. So, if you plan on being problematic, make sure to take some notes on the best ways to pull it off.
“Riverdale” 
“Riverdale” 
I highly suggest watching each episode of Riverdale and taking notes every time a plotpoint makes no sense. I also suggest saving an entire notebook for said notes. This show is a classic example of what not to do. Coincidentally, I also have a review of every episode of Season Four so far. Maybe you should check those out. (Bonus tip: Learn to shamelessly promote yourself).
That one book your high school English teacher recommended
That one book your high school English teacher recommended
Seriously, all your high school English teacher ever wanted was for one of their students to finally read their favorite book so they could talk about it. You kept promising to read it, then pretended that you had, and honestly, you kind of suck for doing that. It’s probably the cure to your writer’s block, but I guess you wouldn’t know that since you never even read it.
“Kung Fu Panda”
“Kung Fu Panda”
Spoiler alert: Po figures out how to live up to his potential. And guess what, you can too! Nothing is more inspirational than watching this lazy panda learn to be the warrior he was destined to become. Get typing! It’s what Po would have wanted.
—Outgoing Books Executive Caroline E. Tew promises she will stop talking about that one summer she spent in LA, someday, probably.

One of my students walked in the other day listening to that horrendous music that kids listen to these days. EDM? Trap? Back in my day, music didn’t have lyrics, women accepted that they would wear corsets until they suffocated, and educated young boys could recite Proust from memory — all from the comfort of their male-only Harvard dorms.
Luckily the music wasn’t anything too offensive this time. The woman’s voice was sweet and pleasant, even though she was unfortunately singing about female emancipation. The student informed me that the woman in question is Taylor Swift, once a champion for femininity, but now, sadly, a vocal activist wanting the rights to her own music. Imagine! A woman being able to write her own lyrics!
That alone was enough to make me shudder, but most off-putting about her lyrics was this line: “'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man.” Like any white-collar man born in an upper-class WASP family, I am fluent in Latin, and I can recite Catullus and Ovid by heart. I have never read a book written by a woman. I firmly believe that with a good command of both Latin and Ancient Greek, a man needs no other schooling; these subjects teach the essentials, and I find it insulting that anyone suggest reading literature beyond the 16th century, let alone study gravity or chemical processes. It’s astounding to me that people no longer believe in the four humors of the body, just as Hippocrates did.
But back to the music. Ms. Swift, if she must speak in such an unwomanly way in public, must at least demonstrate her knowledge of the subjunctive mood. Doesn’t she know that the correct phrasing is “‘Cause if I were a man’”? Has quality of education really declined this sharply?
Since clearly I must explain the concept to my plebeian readers, the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or desires on the part of the speaker. It has been replaced by the regular indicative mood in Modern English, much to my chagrin. I long to return to the days of Middle English, when most people never lived to the age of 30 and the subjunctive mood was used by all.
Because I don’t know how to use a computer, I requested the help of a young man at the library to find more lyrical examples. Ms. Swift has shown general negligence regarding the subjunctive: In “22,” she writes, “Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines,” even though she should have said, “Tonight’s the night that we forget.”
I would be more than happy to educate Ms. Swift on the subjunctive, and could easy prepare some Latin texts for perusal, though I am uncertain if she would prefer Ovid’s erotic love poetry or Julius Caesar’s war diaries.

—Incoming Books Exec Cassandra Luca ’21 is grateful to her Latin, Spanish, and French teachers for their endless grammar exercises on the subjunctive. Contact her at cassandra.luca@thecrimson.com to find out why it’s so hard for native English speakers to learn it.

As far back as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to be a film exec.
Film is not an art. It’s a lifestyle. And of all films, there is but one genre that should be considered above the rest. One genre to rule them all, one genre to find them. One genre to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. (Note: That genre isn’t fantasy. And yes, I get the irony.) Here is the quintessential gangster’s guide to film.
1. Marvel movies are amusement parks. They don’t convey the deep human emotions that are inherent in cinema. They don’t challenge the depths of the human psyche — well, except for “Logan” and “The Dark Knight” trilogy. They don’t succeed in conveying important themes in today’s world. Well, except for “Black Panther” and “Wonder Woman.” And what do they have aside from special effects anyway? Well, aside from some good character payoffs, nice development, and heart?
2. “Shark Tale” exists, and I’m still grieving. It’s an animated gangster movie parody for kids — kids who aren’t old enough to see any of the gangster movies that are being parodied. It’s amazing to think that someone could have sat down and said, “Hey, this is a good idea!” Somehow, DreamWorks managed to convince Robert De Niro to play Don Lino, the patriarch of the gangster sharks who wants to turn his son, who wants to be a dolphin, into his successor gangster shark. And they turned Martin Scorsese into a pufferfish. A pufferfish! Remind me again how this project got green-lit?
3. The only two things I’ve learned in life are to "never rat on my friends and always keep my mouth shut." Unfortunately, that meant my high school teacher always ended up blaming me for the shortcomings in my group projects. And it also makes it difficult to boost my participation in section.
4. If you do decide to write for film, and you don’t submit your reviews on time, there will be repercussions. It is what it is. It’s not personal; it’s strictly business. As Bill the Butcher said “You know how I stayed alive this long? Fear. Somebody steals from me, I cut off his hands. He offends me, I cut out his tongue. He rises against me, I cut off his head, stick it on a pike, raise it high up so all on the streets can see.” But no pressure, I swear I’m chill.
—In all seriousness, Lanz Aaron G. Tan ‘22, incoming Film Executive, is not this serious. He’s more serious. He has never waited for anyone who was late more than 10 minutes in his life (even taking traffic into account). And not showing up to a meeting — in a suit — is making a dangerous point.

With the biggest global opening for an animated film in history, “Frozen 2” has proven to be a resounding success for Disney. Having made $358 million in its opening weekend, and after being called an “indomitable, enjoyable powerhouse” and “well-worth the six-year wait” by top critics, Disney plans to capitalize on the film’s momentum in a series of franchise expansions.
At a press conference, Disney+ President Connor Dowd announced production on seven 12-episode miniseries to debut on the newly launched streaming service, each highlighting the backstory of a character from the film, including Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf, as well as Ryder, Honeymaren, and Grand Pabbie, the leader of the Rock Trolls. “We felt that Pabbie’s two-minute scene in the film did not do justice to his depth as a character,” Sam O’Connell, head screenwriter, says. “In the series, we hope to highlight his substantive accomplishments as Grand Rock Troll, like his flagship healthcare initiative: ObsidiCare.”
Amelia Roth, head of Disney Parks and Resorts, announced the new “Elsa and Anna’s Frozen Spectacular” attraction opening soon at Tokyo Disney, Disneyland Paris, and Walt Disney World. Chapek ensured that Imagineers were hard at work developing an “immersive guest experience,” complete with “interactive precipitation” and “facilitated expenditure.” One developer, however, reported, “It’s just a room where they play the movie on repeat, and fake snow falls whenever Elsa shoots an ice beam or whatever. They only let you out after you buy something from the gift shop.”
“We’ll be partnering with the Department of Education to design programs to facilitate cultural literacy,” announced Disney CEO Aline Damas, in response to a recent finding that 30% of first grade students had not yet memorized the lyrics to “Into the Unknown.” The pilot program, launching this December, plans to add class recitations of the Arendellian anthem following the Pledge of Allegiance, the mandatory playing of the movie soundtrack during nap time, and math practice problems that incorporate themes from the show.
“If Margaret buys two Princess Elsa’s Sparkling Ice Castle LEGO sets and three Bruni the Fire Salamander plushies, how many months of Disney+ can she still afford?” recites third grader Derek Chen from his math workbook. “I think it’s really cool! Plus, we don’t have to do P.E. anymore,” Chen says, referring, of course, to the pilot program’s replacement of the standard physical education curriculum with “e-PE,” a 30-minute block where students play the “Frozen Adventures” mobile game on their classroom set of iPads. The iPads are a part of Disney’s $30,000 donation to the school district for hosting the program, the largest influx of money the school has received since the appointment of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education.
Producer Isabel Ruehl also announced development on another installment in the franchise. Following praise for “Frozen 2”’s handling of issues surrounding the rights of indigenous peoples, screenwriters plan to continue addressing contemporary political topics in “Frozen 3.” “Following accusations of collusion with the neighboring Southern Isles, as well as an incriminating phone call with the Duke of Weselton, Queen Elsa faces a series of hearings before the Council of Rock Trolls,” describes Ruehl, “all while having to deal with domestic issues like criminal justice reform, divestment from the prison-ice mining complex, and the Ice Kingdom’s (literally) existential threat of climate change.”
“Frozen 3”’s release is slated for November 2022, following the release of “Toy Story 5,” “Avengers 7,” and “Star Wars: Episode XVIII.”

Chu’s infatuation with “Frozen” can be attributed to his unhealthy general obsession with Disney, the fact that he is a 10-year-old trapped in a college student’s body, or the fact that, since coming to the East Coast, he has been perpetually, literally frozen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I default to experts on most things. I don’t wear white after Labor Day. I buy bonds because they’re a safer investment than stocks. I believe Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There’s one thought I have that’s entirely my own, though, and it’s a pretty unpopular one: Russell Crowe was a terrific Javert.
In 1862, “The Book of Mormon” was inspiring deadly riots and John Wilkes Booth was just a random actor. In France, however, Victor Hugo was putting the finishing touches on “Les Misérables.” For those unaware, it is one of the longest novels ever published. I will never read it, and neither will you. A quick Wikipedia summary reveals that the book centers around Jean Valjean as he breaks his parole and evades the wrath of Inspector Javert. The novel was adapted into a musical, which was adapted into a movie in 2012 that got nominated for eight Oscars and nine BAFTAs.
Even though the movie was well-received, nobody liked Russell Crowe as Javert. His performance was part of why Emma Gosnell of The Telegraph walked out of the movie, and Rich Knight of Cinema Blend believes it single-handedly took the film out of contention for Best Picture. The critics missed the boat here. Yes, Crowe was considerably worse at singing than everybody else in the movie. That is why he was the perfect Javert.
Crowe’s ineptitude made Javert realistic. Demanding that everybody in 1830s France have a perfect voice is too much to ask. The bishop can be a soothing baritone since he has to sing in church every day. Cosette can hit the high notes because she spent her entire childhood singing to her imaginary friends. But I draw the line at Javert having a voice that’s anything better than present-day Bob Dylan. This is a man who has committed his life to overseeing prison laborers, which doesn’t leave him much free time to practice his scales. Singing during work is out of the question, since his coworkers would ridicule him every time he missed a note. His only option is to sing quietly to himself, so soft that nobody can hear him, developing a beautifully flawed voice over the course of many decades of bathroom breaks and baguette lines. Of course his voice is awful. Shame on you for expecting otherwise.
Ultimately, I derive pleasure from watching Crowe’s Javert for the same reason I tutor my little sister in precalculus: It’s nice to be better at things than other people. That’s why I, at 6’4”, exclusively play basketball against second-graders. The only way for me to assert my waning privilege as a straight white man in today’s society is by turning on the TV and chuckling at Russell Crowe singing like your drunk professor at karaoke night. So, no, I don’t care what you think, Russell Crowe was perfect in “Les Misérables.”

In a recent appearance on “The Tonight Show,” country music icon Dolly Parton revealed the inspiration behind her 1973 hit single, “Jolene.” What she didn’t reveal is that the woman who inspired “Jolene” is me.
I know what you’re thinking: How could I possibly be the inspiration for a song released 25 years before my birth? Allow me to explain: Time is a social construct.
To quote Walt Whitman, “I am large, I contain multitudes.” One of my “multitudes” just happens to be that I am the inspiration behind Dolly Parton’s “Jolene.”
Exhibit A: The Lyrics 
Take a moment to consult the following “Jolene” lyrics and a photograph of me (provided above):
“Your beauty is beyond compare / With flaming locks of auburn hair / With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green”
Auburn hair? Ivory skin?? Eyes of emerald green??? Check. Check. Check. You may be able to chalk up my appearance to that of a leprechaun on steroids, but make no mistake. Who else could this song could possibly be in reference to?
Exhibit B: The Story
Parton identified the real-life Jolene as a redheaded bank teller who “got this terrible crush on [her] husband.” It is clear to me that “bank teller” is a secret code for “donut shop counter girl,” a position I held for approximately four years at a shop in my hometown which you cannot prove Dolly Parton has never visited.
I, for one, resent the accusations levied against me. As a service worker, I am obliged to be polite to everyone that comes into my shop. If your husband “talks about [me] in his sleep,” that’s certainly not my problem.
And let’s get another thing straight: If I were to flirt with anyone in this scenario I’d flirt with the nine time Grammy winner and unofficial gay icon herself, not her husband. No offense to Carl Dean, but I couldn’t pick that man out of a one-person police lineup.
Exhibit C: The Name
According to Parton, she got the idea for the name “Jolene” from a redheaded young girl in the audience at one of her early shows. Do you know what the “J” in Allison J. Scharmann stands for? Do you? That’s right. It’s “Jolene.” The girl in the audience, you may have already guessed, was also me.
It is the curse of my existence that I must live out the rest of my days with the physical and linguistic markers of Parton’s infamous “Jolene.”
In the meantime, please stop begging me not to take your men.
I’m not interested.
— Allison J. Scharmann is the outgoing Music Exec and incoming Arts Chair. She would really appreciate if one of her more affluent, Ivy League peers could convince our lord and savior Dolly Parton not to press charges. To request the return of your man, please reach out to iris.lewis@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
French salons produced art of The Enlightenment; the Bloomsbury Group fostered modernist masterpieces; and now, from the mysterious gatherings of youths born after 2000, a new form of poetics is emerging: Gen Z Talk. We’ve all heard it: smol, stan, gucci, highkey, can’t even. If you’re an upperclassman or older, you’re excluded from this elite circle of cutting-edge language creation — but that doesn’t mean you can’t decode it, with a little help from this phrasebook.
1. Slaps
“That song really slaps,” someone might say when “HIGHEST IN THE ROOM” comes on. Other things that slap (though it’s most commonly used for songs): Jefe’s, Kirkland Stein, MFA's newest exhibit. This definition is pretty self-evident — basically it’s a compliment to anything cool. Dental coverage for grad students? That would slap. Divestment? That too.
2. Going Rover
Urban Dictionary puts it best: “Breaking off of something and going your own way.” This could mean storming the field after a football win, especially if the game is at Fenway. And this sort of individuality is, after all, what our liberal arts education is encouraging us to assert. Angela Merkel told us, at last year’s Commencement, that “if we break down the walls that hem us in, if we step out into the open and have the courage to embrace new beginnings, everything is possible.” In short: “Go rover.”
3. Celly Game
The capacity to celebrate. And this month we need a great capacity to meet the demands of winter formals, holidays, New Years. Maybe you need to up your celly game, or maybe your celly game slaps already. See? It all comes together quite smoothly.
4. No Cap
Think: when someone takes off their hat — when they enter a church, for example, or office hours — it means something serious is about to happen. “No cap” instills into speech this same aura of solemnity. “I can’t wait for break, no cap,” your Gen Z friend might say, meaning “I’m being serious,” or “honestly.” No cap is the best policy.
5. G
Simple and sweet, this little phrase is what you call that someone special. When you lock yourself out of your room in the quad and your roommate rushes back to let you in, make sure you tell them: “You’re such a G.” It’s the highest compliment you can pay.
With these phrases under your belt, you can feel confident deciphering — and maybe even speaking — the language of tomorrow’s leaders. It is our collective duty, after all, to stay abreast of culture and the arts — and a mission that The Crimson’s Arts Board in particular is proud to lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Had a calm, peaceful sophomore fall filled with an appropriate amount of responsibilities and minimal existential crises? Didn’t think so.
In case you’re also currently putting out dumpster fires with coffee and mac and cheese bites (just me?), this is the soundtrack for you. Read on for the five stages of sophomore slump, communicated in the only language music theater nerds know!
1. “Corner of the Sky,” Pippin (September)
Ever found yourself reaching for generic, nonsensical metaphors to describe the nightmare that is picking just one (or two, if you’re a masochist) thing to study? Before Pippin turns to farming and the military to find himself, he sings this ominously optimistic ballad on cats, large bodies of water, and his general lack of purpose. The show is already an extended existential crisis, but the painful optimism of this intro number is really on another level.
2. “Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better),” Annie Get Your Gun (October)
Thought you could handle “a little more responsibility” after freshman year? Did you also sign up for eight new clubs at the activities fair because you felt threatened by your friend’s ex-roommate’s girlfriend? Get ready for the ultimate one-upping song! I promise, once you hear Bernadette Peters hold the last note of “Yes I Can” for 19 seconds just to emasculate the male lead, you’ll get what I mean.
3. “Empty Chairs and Empty Tables,” Les Misérables (November)
There’s nothing quite as eerie as spending the night in Lamont and slowly watching each miserable late-night studier go to bed, until it’s just you, Red Bull, and a pset that was due two hours ago. When you’re looking for the perfect eulogy to lament the loss of your weaker (or more efficient) comrades, look no further than this truly soul-crushing number.
4. “The Last Midnight,” Into the Woods (December)
Yes, I’m aware I’ve been pushing off that midterm project I got three extensions on, but nothing prepared me for the sheer terror of knowing that I truly have 37 minutes until 11:59 P.M., and it’s actually, officially, unavoidably due. Be careful — listen to that chorus enough, and Meryl Streep’s “Witch” might actually scare you into never procrastinating another assignment.
5. “It Was a Shit Show,” Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (January)
Once you’ve cycled through all the optimism, denial, and disaster that is sophomore fall, it’s time to call it what it is — a “beautiful, heart stopping, breathtaking, life-changing (shit show).” Not just a mess of perfectly confusing exaggeration, the song’s also about someone inexplicably quitting things mid-season. Maybe, it’s time to follow Greg’s lead and lighten our schedule a little next semester?

Some say art needs a little mystery. Some say the value of art lies in its interpretability, in its capacity for intrigue, in its infinite enigmas.
I say, why the secrecy? As the final arbiter of all art ever, I have the answers. And for the incredibly low price of external validation, I will share those answers with you. Ask no more; the nature of art will be revealed. You’re welcome.
How was Stonehenge built?
Many have guessed that Stonehenge was constructed by aliens. They’re close, but not quite right: Stonehenge is actually a poignant artistic note left behind by WALL-E, the space-travelling robot who saves humanity in the 2008 Pixar film of the same name. After the movie ends, WALL-E takes up time travel. Stonehenge is his damning critique of climate change, not that the Neolithic proto-English from 2500 B.C. could have known that.
Who is Banksy?
The real identity of the ostensibly-subversive British street artist known as “Banksy” isn’t important. What you should know is that Banksy is actually the whistleblower who claimed that President Donald J. Trump is misrepresenting his dealings with Ukraine. You thought the whistleblower was a C.I.A. officer? You thought Banksy was from the United Kingdom? You thought there was anything Banksy couldn’t do? That’s the “art” part, baby.
Who is the “Girl with a Pearl Earring” from the Johannes Vermeer painting?
Meryl Streep. Obviously.
Why is the Mona Lisa smiling?
Listen, why is it so important to you that the Mona Lisa is smiling? She’s not smiling. If she is smiling, it’s to make you go away. Why do you always expect women to smile at you? Think about it. Talk it over with your therapist. It’s almost the 2020s — you can’t go around acting like sexism is acceptable anymore.
Will Lorde ever release another album?
“YES, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go” (“Green Light”)
“I cut my teeth on wedding rings” (“Royals”)
“WILL you say I've changed?” (“Writer in the Dark”)
I swear, it’s like close reading is dead to you people.
What happened to the paintings stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum?
In 1990, 13 paintings worth $500 million — including works by Edgar Degas, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Johannes Vermeer — were stolen from the Gardner Museum by two men posing as police officers. Over two decades later, in 2013, the F.B.I. announced that they had found connections to the Boston mafia. While the hunt was subsequently truncated by the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the F.B.I. has expressed confidence that the mob was involved.
But aren’t we all the mob? Isn’t the real mob the democratic electorate, the uneducated masses, the victims and the perpetrators of the herd mentality the Founding Fathers warned us against? Aren’t we all responsible for our country’s sins?
Think about it. The museum is offering a $10 million reward.
— Incoming Arts Chair Iris M. Lewis ’21 will not accept feedback on her art theories unless it comes from either Lorde or WALL-E. Please direct all complaints to allison.scharmann@thecrimson.com.

So your discerning eye for high culture has led you to a seismic revelation that demands to be shared with the Crimson Arts readership. Congratulations on your critical analysis of the constructed capitalist environment you live in! Feasting on the blood of mass media is what keeps us young. Yet not all takes are created equal. Read on for a flow chart of when you should smash that Google Doc share button and when you should really just keep a journal or create a provocative anonymous blog.
Step 1: Will You Be Sued For This Take? 
If No, you’re golden for now. Perhaps you’re teetering on a tightrope like Philippe Petit, thousands of feet above a sea of libel. Move to Step 2 nonetheless.
If Yes, archive the document and go to bed. Drink some calming tea, maybe.
Step 2: If Discovered, Will This Controversial Take Have the Potential to Significantly Impact Your Occupational Future? 
If No, you may fall into one of two categories: a) you want to work for Vulture and the significant impact in question is positive, or b) your take is probably not hot enough. If b), return to Step 1 and flesh out your take to the knife’s edge of danger before continuing.
If Yes, self-interrogation is in order. For instance, how important is it to state on record that you fell asleep during “The Irishman” if you’d love to meet Marty one day in an old-school sauce joint and hand him an embossed business card? If the former outweighs the latter, plow ahead.
Step 3: Will Your Friends and Loved Ones Think Less of You For Publishing This Take? 
If No, congratulations. Feel free to skip to Step 5.
If Yes, it might be a good time to reflect on the take itself and excavate any malicious intent, which, if found, indicates that the take should be retired. But if the take withstands ethical scrutiny, perhaps the anticipated hostility is more a matter of taste. Does your great-uncle adore the chauvinist HBO crime drama you are about to critique? This brings us to Step 4, which is...
Step 4: Do You Care If Your Loved Ones Think Less Of You For Publishing This Take? 
If No, you’re in the clear — though they’d appreciate a heads up nonetheless. You’ve made it to Step 5.
If Yes, maybe it’s time to throw in the towel, even on that noble tirade about how Lindsay Lohan’s early music career was criminally underrated. Her artistic dignity just isn’t worth a tense Thanksgiving dinner.
Step 5: Do You Want This Take to Be Attached to Your Name in Perpetuity? 
If No, the implications of the previous steps were misunderstood. Best wishes for a more brazenly confident take next time.
If Yes, congratulations, you’re ready to publish! Check back in 10 years and see if you stand by your choices when Martha from work forwards your impassioned critique of Jennifer Lopez’s 2000s cultural dominance to the whole office.

The college admissions process can be daunting. Follow the steps below to make it a whole lot easier.
Step 1: Selectively Fail the SAT
Admissions officers may tell you that they look for “well-rounded” students as a part of their “holistic” evaluative process. These are lies. Be as poorly-rounded as possible. Take the SAT, for instance. Simply choose one section to perform well on, then fail the rest. If you like math, get every question on the reading and writing sections wrong. It will show colleges where your priorities lie.
Step 2: The Information Session
Information sessions are not meant to give you information at all — think of them as auditions. Most prospective students will ask lame questions about student life or admissions, but you are not so foolish. You will impress admissions officers and intimidate your peers by raising your hand, standing proudly, and reciting the entire script of “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead” until somebody forces you to stop because you’re embarrassing the less prepared students.
Step 3: The Essay
An essay is a great chance to show off your prowess as a writer, right? Wrong! You are not bound by the constraints of this literary form. Instead, make a name for yourself by submitting an avant-garde video essay. Known academic Billie Eilish began her chart-topping album with the memorable sound of her removing her Invisalign, which means that your official College Board video essay should begin the same way. Buy Invisalign even if you don’t need it; it will communicate to colleges that you care about both Billie Eilish and orthodontic health.
Step 4: Interview Mind Games
Your assigned interviewer may want to meet you at a nearby Starbucks. Do not let that happen! Your interviewer will have no choice but to remember you if you reject the proposed meeting location and change it to somewhere quirky and fun, like the sporting goods section of Walmart or the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Playing hard to get is important, so once you choose a location, reschedule a few times and arrive fashionably late. Make a clever pop culture reference to justify your lateness by quoting Ke$ha’s “TiK ToK” and telling your interviewer that “the party don’t start ‘til I walk in.”
Step 5: Art Time
After interviewing and submitting their application, the average student believes that their work is done. You, on the other hand, should not rest until you have been accepted. Many colleges accept art supplements, so send them an ongoing art supplement that includes new pieces created daily. Everybody knows that, when it comes to art, quantity matters infinitely more than quality — just as the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Announce that the first week will be “poetry week” and send a new poem each day. Next comes “opera week,” so warm up your vocal cords! The third week demands live performance art to make sure admissions officers remember your face as well as your name.
Good luck, and remember one thing: It’s the climb.

Hollywood realized that if you pick an iconic 20th-century musician, violently twist their life story to fit a narrative arch about corrupting fame and eventual redemption, and include some epic concerts scenes, you’ll have a blockbuster and even some Oscar wins. Looking at you, “Bohemian Rhapsody.”
Yet while Gen X-ers gorge themselves on biopics of Queen, Elton John, Judy Garland, and Bruce Springsteen, America’s newest generation has been left bored. Now’s the chance for film executives to strike the iron while it’s hot and grab Gen Z’s attention. Here are five movie pitches guaranteed to hit these fledgling adults with some gut-punching nostalgia about using PictoChat on their DS’s with wrists covered in Silly Bandz.
5. “A Mid-Weekend Morning Nightmare,” featuring Rebecca Black
Rebecca Black’s “Friday” presents the closest thing to a Shakspearian tragedy that the internet has ever seen. A young girl, innocent and unaware of YouTube’s potential for evil, creates a music video for her birthday only to be properly massacred by hatred online. Only after years of reflection did society come to realize its sins and the song’s so-bad-it’s-good quality — but it was too late and the damage already done. It’s time for us to be the Horatio to Rebecca’s Hamlet: “If thou didst ever hold [her] in thy heart...tell [her] story.”
4. “BELUGA HEIGHTS: The Musical,” featuring Jason Derulo
On top of the internet firestorm that erupted when the nightmarish “Cats” trailer dropped, many fans were also shocked to see Jason Derulo as part of the star-studded cast. He once dominated charts with smash hits like “Whatcha Say” and “Talk Dirty to Me,” and had every kid at a middle school dance in 2013 screaming, “Your booty don’t need explaining.” The transition from singing about cheating and wiggling to playing an anthropomorphic cat named “Rum Tum Tugger,” is a wild one, and the mysterious void of five years in between must be filled.
3. “I Believe I Can (Fire)fly,” featuring Owl City 
Perhaps the most memeable song from the Zoomer’s era, Owl City’s “Fireflies” has taken on a life of its own, rallying crowds around a poignant message of...insects who leave teardrops everywhere and like to foxtrot?! While Adam Young, the powerhouse of this one-man band, has only had one other hit, “Good Time,” his cultural impact deserves a proper celebration — plus a Carly Rae Jepsen cameo could make this movie a two-for-one deal.
2. “Boom Boom Pow, Where Are They Now?” featuring The Black Eyed Peas
In 2011, the nation received bone-chilling news that the Black Eyed Peas would be going on an indefinite hiatus. Flash forward eight years and the group has yet to make a true comeback with Fergie. It is time Hollywood steps in to cover this story and fill the pea-sized hole in all our hearts. Getting to see the origin story behind the iconic burn, “I’m so 3008, you so 2000 and late” alone makes this endeavor worth the effort.
1. “This is Not Us Anymore,” featuring One Direction
Of course the alpha of contemporary boy bands should get a masterful retelling of their earth-shattering rise and heart-breaking demise. True, there was already a documentary about their tour called “This Is Us,” but that was created B.Z.E (before Zayn’s exodus). Harry Styles’s successful SNL hosting appearance plus the adoration he receives from the Crimson Arts Board prove that “Directioners” are still out there, foaming at the mouth for new content.

—Incoming Columns Exec Samantha J. O’Connell dipped her toe into art journalism mainly to compensate for the fact that she used to worship One Direction and her favorite film of all time used to be “Ella Enchanted.” It didn’t work. Highbrow art is cool and all, but she continues to listen to the album “FOUR” and will forever enjoy Anne Hathaway singing “Somebody to Love” at a giant’s wedding for the rest of her days. Please email sam.o'connell@thecrimson.com if you share these respectable beliefs.

There’s nothing quite like checking your phone at 11 a.m. to see a notification pointing out your greatest insecurities. I used to have to rely on texts from my mom for that. Now, however, I can cut the middleman and hear it straight from the stars. Enter Co – Star, the “hyper-personalized, social experience bringing astrology into the 21st century.”  By calculating your birth to the minute, Co – Star promises to deliver you personalized daily horoscopes that walk the line between inspiring and utterly threatening. Whether the messages are crafted by a coalition of NASA data and expert astrologers — as their website attests — or by some underpaid intern slurping down an iced coffee, it’s hard to shake the feeling that Co – Star eagerly awaits your impending death.  Just how horror movie-esque can these messages be? Quiz yourself with the quotes below to find out!
1. “Keep in mind that you are dying every day.”
This friendly reminder is from Co – Star. I received it midway through a chocolate muffin and used it to justify eating another one.
2. “Be afraid. Be very afraid.”
Masterfully delivered by the incomparable Geena Davis, this line from “The Fly” is meant to warn an innocent girl to not trust Jeff Goldblum. Given some of Goldblum’s recent comments, Davis might have had a point.
3. “How’s your heart doing right now?”
I received this Co – Star message midway through another chocolate muffin, prompting me to throw the rest away and abstain from sugar for the rest of the week.
4. “We all go a little mad sometimes.”
Norman Bates definitely has a point in this line from “Psycho.” I, for example, get a little mad when I remember that Anthony Perkins wasn’t even nominated for an Oscar for this role.
5. “Whatever you do, don’t fall asleep.”
This is a classic line from “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” but it could just as easily be the Co – Star motivation I need to justify chugging a midnight cup of coffee to finish a paper.
6. “There isn’t a way that you can be killed that would matter.”
I have known no peace since I received this Co – Star message. If there’s any way that this can be construed as anything other than a threat, please let me know.
7. “They’re all going to laugh at you.”
Sure, this is a line from “Carrie,” but it’s even more horrifyingly used as the title of Adam Sandler’s debut comedy album.
8. “Burn it all down and start over.”
This Co – Star message sounds more like a line from “Carrie” than the actual line from “Carrie.”
9. “If you want to become liquid and fill people’s voids, please do it safely”
Co – Star, I’m begging you to stop.
10. “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.”
This is obviously just a line from “The Shining,” right? Nope, it’s also an actual horoscope I received from Co – Star. I’m glad they’re at least somewhat self-aware about how terrifying they sound.

There’s an inherent vanity in art — somewhere, someone had to decide whatever piece or experience is worth our attention and time, our contemplations and confusions, our laughs and tears. But perhaps more vain, then, is the sport (dare I even call it that?) of stealing art: art heists. At its core, an art heist is a robbery. The most publicized ones involve highly elaborate productions resulting in the loss of up to millions and millions of dollars of art. Just last week, jewels of “immeasurable value” were stolen from the Dresden Royal Palace in what’s been called the “biggest such theft” since WWII, all through a loophole of the alarm system.
But something about these robberies seems more sophisticated and acceptable to society.
The popular “Ocean’s” movies serve as blatant examples of over-glamorized art heist stories. Though Danny Ocean’s crew is really trying to save themselves in “Ocean’s Twelve” by pulling off an art heist amidst a web of favors and money they owe, the story trivializes the loss of the actual art to the museum and the viewing public. Their elaborate plan to pull off the heist and the Jason Bourne-like moves the crew pulls off in the process add to that glamorization. In one particular scene, a thief known as the “Night Fox” maneuvers through a thick entanglement of laser beams in the lobby of a museum through a mix of precise martial arts and impressive dance choreography, set to an upbeat electronic tune.
His sister Debbie’s plan in the all-female spin-off, “Ocean’s 8,” gives the same kind of endorsement for such art heists, even tying in alternative incentives of getting back at personal retributions. Not a word is said about the jewels that end up stolen themselves. Perhaps the fact that these thieves plan on returning these pieces — just at a high cost — makes the whole idea of the theft palatable to audiences.
Not all depictions are guilty of this glamorization. Donna Tartt’s famed “The Goldfinch” gives a nod to the more complicated underlyings beneath the heist itself, but even her story romanticizes the concept of art theft in a dramatic fashion. I admit, it’s a guilty pleasure.
Maybe people don’t actually care about these jewels and old paintings. Besides, if they’re stolen, you can just look up what it looks like on Google images, right? How much is the public really missing out on? But on principle, even if it’s “just art” or “just jewels,” it’s still theft. And although these stolen pieces are often highly valuable, the stolen art marketplace is supposedly a tough place to crack.
It’s not secret knowledge that it’s hard to sell these prized pieces once stolen. Robert Wittman, founder of the FBI's art crime team, told The Atlantic in a 2012 interview that “the general pattern is that the criminals who do these jobs, these heists, are good thieves, but they're terrible businessmen.” Fast forward nine years to now, though, and the thieves are still doing it. Either Wittman was just saying that with the hopes of discouraging more people to steal art and there does exist some large market for people to sell, or, these thieves really don’t care that much about selling the art itself.
Independent of value, major art heists themselves become a grandiose act, something seen as almost impressive to execute, as terrible the consequences. The mystery that shrouds many of them and the continuing investigation draw in art connoisseurs and crime fanatics alike. Even the casual bystander finds themself fantasizing and wondering about the complex plans behind the disappearances of remarkable pieces of art. Insofar as art has vanity, then, art heists exhibit an even cruder and haughtier side of human vanity.
— Outgoing Editor-At-Large Lucy Wang ’20 wrote this piece, and many others, in vain. Her identical twin brother, Brucy (valued approx. $2.79), was lost in an art heist at 14 Plympton Street. Please send tips to lucy.wang@thecrimson.com.

Sometimes section can feel like a cutthroat competition where you have to lip-sync (or “bounce off of that”) for your life. Here is an all-star lineup of your favorite drag queens as your least favorite classmates. If you’re offended because you feel as if this article reads you for filth, remember, this is “RuPaul’s Drag Race” not “RuPaul’s Best Friends’ Race.”
The Section Kid — Roxxxy Andrews
The Section Kid always has something to say. Is it always something productive? No, but that doesn’t matter. The Section Kid wants to be known, and known they will be. Season Five and All-Stars contestant, Roxxxy Andrews is The Section Kid because she needs her opinion to be heard, even if — especially if — nobody asked for it.
The Class Clown — Bianca Del Rio
The Class Clown lives to make people laugh. Whether it’s a snarky comment about somebody else in the room or a muttered joke about the assignment, the Class Clown always has something to say — but unlike The Section Kid, it’s something worth being said. Much like Miss Del Rio, The Class Clown is kind of a jerk but at least they target The Section Kid instead of you.
The One and Done — Vanessa “Vanjie” Mateo
The One and Done shows up to the first section, grabs a syllabus, and is never to be seen again. Despite being M.I.A., The One and Done leaves their mark on you. You’ll never forget how, despite showing up to class just once, they managed to make the stupidest comment you’ve heard all semester. The One and Done might make an appearance at the end of the semester or even at the beginning of the next in a different section just like Miss Vanjie (“MISS VAAAAANJIE”) reappeared in Season Eleven after being the first to be eliminated from Season Ten.
The Bullshitter — Valentina 
The Bullshitter is who we all think we are (but really aren’t). The Bullshitter clearly doesn’t know that “reading is fundamental,” has probably never looked at the syllabus, and submits every assignment to Canvas at 11:58P.M. Despite this, your TF loves The Bullshitter for their “hard work and dedication” to the course. Season Nine fan favorite, Valentina, is The Bullshitter for trying to lip-sync for her life with a mask covering her face.
The Sleeper — Jinkx Monsoon
Just as the name implies, The Sleeper naps their way through every section, every week, and through even the most intense rants from The Section Kid. What is The Sleeper doing at night that causes them to sleep during class? You can never ask The Sleeper this because they’re already knocked out by the time you walk into class and the second section ends, they are out the door and onto their next nap sesh. The Sleeper may have never spoken in class but their snoring filled the silences that The Section Kid couldn’t. Season Five winner and self-proclaimed narcoleptic, Jinkx Monsoon, is The Sleeper. Almost impressively, Jinkx Monsoon fell asleep in a corner of the workroom during fights between the queens, while she was supposed to. D working on projects, and whenever she just felt generally stressed (mood).

During the three and a half years I’ve spent at the Crimson, I’ve consumed a lot of art. I’ve also been radicalized as a feminist. Naturally, these two developments progressively converged. As my journalistic career comes to a close, I have to ask myself: Will I ever be able to appreciate art without reading feminist meaning into it? As shown by this list, probably not. But what’s the fun of binge watching a show if you aren’t constantly deconstructing its gender dynamics à la Laura Mulvey?
Unpopular Opinion: Princess Fiona is Film’s Best Feminist Action Hero
Sure, Princess Fiona is technically “rescued” from a castle, but “Shrek” is really a parody of fairy tales. The prince in shining amor is an ogre; Lord Faarquad is, well, not the stereotypical, picturesque king; and Fiona rejects her rescuer and being made the prize. She knows self-defense. She saves herself and loved ones. She embraces her “ugly” side. Shrek’s kiss might activate her inner ogre, but Shrek’s character development is similarly contingent on kissing Fiona — a radical reciprocity refreshing not only for animation, but for film at large.
Unpopular Opinion: Pam is Boring Apart From Jim
It wasn’t until I watched Season Five episode 23 of “The Office” for what was probably the fourth or fifth time that it hit me: Pam is boring. Sure, her repartee with Jim provides comic relief, as do her disgusted glares to the camera when Michael makes an off-color joke. But alone, she has little aspiration or character. It’s not her fault: She’s written in as the object of Jim’s affection (or Michael’s harassment), and her personality ends there. As much as I love “The Office” and rely on it as my personal form of therapy, it falls short of developing its female protagonist independent from the men around her.
Unpopular Opinion: “Ten Things I Hate About You" is Actually (But Imperfectly) Feminist
“Ten Things I Hate About You” could be dismissed as just another iteration of the infamously sexist “Taming of the Shrew,” but I’d argue it inadvertenently provided our generation a feminist icon in Kat Stratford. Even though (or maybe because) her classmates describe her as a “heinous bitch,” Kat embodies everything I wanted to be as a young teen: unbothered by her classmates' disdain, aggressive on the soccer field, and precociously well-versed in Simone de Beauvoir. Just because Kat ultimately falls for Patrick — I mean, that stunt on the bleachers? — doesn’t mean she loses her feminist identity. It just shows that love and feminism aren’t mutually exclusive, which is hope for my cold, feminist heart.
This might just be me justifying why I love this movie so much — it was filmed 15 minutes away from my house and gives me some rare Washington pride — and it’s far from flawless. But in the context of the ‘90s, “Ten Things I Hate About You” was a big step in the teen movie genre in depicting its radically progressive heroine.
— Outgoing Arts Chair Kaylee S. Kim ’20 is a sappy, soon-to-be-graduating senior who doesn’t want to leave her Arts kin. She would like to thank her similarly misanthropic Co-Chair, Caroline A. Tsai ’20, for the past year — she would not have survived without her irreverent closeouts, enviable wit, and 3 a.m. text rants.

Since I can’t disentangle my life from “30 Rock,” here are the episodes that made me declare, “Mood,” as the Yard-dwelling youngins do, and that serve as the audio-book-equivalent accompaniments to my story as an Arts Exec.
1. “College” 
Liz (Tina Fey) opens a bar tab for her staff after winning the crew lottery, hoping to get in their good graces. She ends up overcompensating, high on their approval, and gives away her grandfather’s watch. I thought of this episode in the beginning of the semester, when I was eager to please. However, unlike Liz, I was neither a high school bully nor an avid sparrow-watcher. I also didn’t give away any family heirlooms to get compers to like me, but around this time I found myself granting (offering) way too many extensions, dispensing compliments the way Leap Day William tosses candy, and smiling too hard.
2. “The Fabian Strategy”
Kenneth the Page (Jack McBrayer) has been fired and now works at CBS, but Tracy (Tracy Morgan), who has become dependent on him, hallucinates Kenneth wherever he goes. I felt like Kenneth, not unwelcome but unnecessary, when I served my InDesign shift. I would walk over to the rowdy Arts production table at any (imagined) mention of my name. You could have conjured me like a hologram with the promise of gossip. Being exiled to the back of the Newsroom made me miss the contentious, near-weekly celebrity crush debate, which is tragic, since I have so many inflammatory opinions to offer. I tried to rally a gang to get snacks at Tommy’s or Tatte, appealing to everyone’s weakness for Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and desperate need for coffee, but for the third time, I was put in my place: “No, you can’t leave, you’re the InDesign person!”
3. “The Tuxedo Begins” 
Liz realizes that if she rides the subway dressed as an utterly repellent, unhinged elderly woman with an old gym bag, they will respect her space. I thought of this episode — perhaps took inspiration from it — the day I decided not to care what people think, and went too far. People complained that my respectably inoffensive pitches were boring (even though I had paraphrased the one-line Google summaries of the Wikipedia summaries myself!) and were, according to outgoing Arts Chair Caroline A. Tsai, “somehow always about sex and spirituality.” I decided to go into the Arts meeting unprepared, unleashing an unfiltered stream of consciousness (what I really thought the film would be like based exclusively on the poster font, which theaters have reclining seats, which actors I think are cute, personal theories about plot twists based on the actors’ zodiac signs) that left compers so mortified and fascinated that they dutifully picked up all of my pitches.
4. “Hogcock!” 
Liz can’t stand being a stay-at-home mom and instigates fights with other stay-at-home moms on internet forums (one such conflict escalates to a scheduled in-person skirmish). I thought of this episode while writing this piece, as I stand on the brink of retirement. What to do with my time now that there is no exec dinner or production night or comp seminar to attend? I would never go so far as to heckle incoming Film Exec Lanz Aaron G. Tan in the comments section of his reviews, but I may or may not stir up lively, wholesome discussion by baiting the Arts comment section regulars under a ridiculous pseudonym.
—Outgoing Film Exec Claire N. Park wants to be your blasé, neighborhood S.W.U.G. (Senior Washed Up Girl), but hates that she cares too much to be one.

Hey! Come on in. Sorry the wait for an appointment was so long — people have been lined up for weeks. With all the stress of balancing a Harvard workload, editing over 40 pieces of arts criticism per week, and general existential malaise, demand skyrocketed this semester. But it’s nothing therapy (or the gentle sensibilities of a situational comedy populated by a multiethnic ensemble of lovable weirdos) can’t fix!
Let’s take a look at your file. Looks like you’ve clocked over 150 hours of viewing time this semester alone. Says here that Netflix has dispatched ambulances to your dorm just to check your vitals on three separate occasions. Hang on, what’s this note? “Paramedics could not find pulse; patient was proclaimed legally dead until quirky side character coined hilarious neologism like ‘budhole,’ ‘bingpot,’ or ‘treat yo self,’ resuscitating patient immediately.”
Interesting — that wasn’t in the medical school textbooks.
What? No, sorry, I wasn’t muttering under my breath, I was just coughing. I have a cold, which will be spun into a 22-minute episode about a high-functioning character who adamantly refuses to allow sickness to interfere with productivity.
But back to you! What brings you in today?
Wow, a whole host of issues. Um, okay, let’s start at the beginning. “A totally inactive love life that exacerbates a latent fear that you are categorically undeserving of affection”? Yeah, we see that all the time in the office. Whoa, calm down — sorry, I didn’t mean that office, I meant this facility, which did not jump the shark by continuing to film even after the series lead left the show seven seasons in.
But back to your love life. I think we can prescribe something for you; how about a callous cynic who hates everybody before meeting an endearing dork, and the ensuing romance is a perfect yin-yang blend of Type A and Type B personalities that plays out over several seasons and restores your belief in soulmates?
Moving on, you also expressed “a total disillusionment with the institutions designed to protect civil rights”? Hmm, okay: Look at this Rorschach test — which is actually a silhouette of Amy Poehler in a sensible skirt suit — and tell me what you see. A sustained belief in the fundamental goodness of humanity, renewed faith in the ideals of liberal democracy, and the inexplicable empathy of well-meaning bureaucrats… I thought you’d say that.
Additionally, if you’re really worried about loneliness, I would advise you to reestablish a connection with close friends you might have lost contact with. That makes you uncomfortable? I totally understand. Maybe instead you can glean vicarious human contact through a rotating cast of caricatures who balance exaggeratedly idiosyncratic behaviors while still preserving a fundamentally human psyche played by any of the following actors: Marc Evan Jackson, Maya Rudolph, Jama Williamson, Jason Mantzoukas.
That’s all for today? Cool cool cool, thanks so much for coming in. Pam can validate your parking at reception. Feel free to stop by any of the Megan Amram-designated pun-titled restaurants down the street.
— Outgoing Arts Chair Caroline A. Tsai ’20 would like to thank the Academy, as well as her shrewd manager, Kaylee S. Kim ’20, without whom she would not have survived the dog-eat-dog world of Hollywood.

That painting of Thomas More in the Frick collection
I, too, am impressed by the impeccable sheen of the velvet on More’s sleeves. Hans Holbein nonetheless chose an unflattering angle and that expression for his face. Why did this painting have to enter the annals of art history? Why is it across from the majestic “St. Francis in the Desert,” who looks less than miserable as he splays out his arms in ecstasy?
“On the Nature of Things”
Once you’ve read the first four pages, you’ve read the whole thing. “De Rerum Natura” is cyclical, and maybe Lucretius was one of the first atomists to have lived, but he could’ve condensed 400 pages into 10 or so, and probably maintained the poetry. Maybe with his ancient Roman education, he hadn’t mastered the art of word limits like us 21st century undergrads. Heidegger blows your mind with the sheer number of words and level of complexity he uses for a bunch of shower thoughts, but with Lucretius, it’s just annoying.
Frank Stella & Jeff Koons
I can think of few ways for overlaid colorful squares on a canvas to make a statement. Maybe they can, maybe they needed to be in a museum (I would prefer them on a carpet). Alternatively, I feel like Koons’ fame was the product of a practical joke by a bunch of curators who got together to see what level of mediocrity they could hype to $58 million — the price of one of those kitsch steel balloon dogs. Koons’ work does expose the absurdity of late-capitalist American consumerism, I guess. He’s winning, but his balloons suck.
Fjallraven Kånken Backpacks
Fjallraven has been the leading force of stylistic monotony of our age. They’re cute, but how did they even get famous? It’s so basic — not in the VSCO girl sense — actually just basic. Is every fifteen year old really thinking to themselves that they need one of these to fit in, except this time in mustard, because no one has that color yet?
“Sunflower” by Vampire Weekend, ft. Steve Lacy
“Vampire Weekend,” “Contra,” and “Modern Vampires of the City” were phenomenal albums. They beautifully encapsulated what it means to be a New Yorker, from the snow-filled Hudson to the young men’s wing at Sloan-Kettering. I’ve mostly relegated the band to middle school memory, but listening to “Horchata” in December still warms me up inside. They absolutely trashed their legacy, however, with “Sunflower.” It pairs hollow lyrics with the most annoying refrain. I didn’t need to hear a white guy kind of scat in 2019. Maybe they can redeem themselves, but I also just want them to stop making music now — maybe they peaked as 20-year-olds, but they might as well maintain their solid (though now tarnished) reputation.
—Shruthi Venkata is the outgoing Columns Exec, and she doesn’t in fact hate most of these things, except for maybe “Sunflower.” Most of them are overrated. You can reach her at shruthi.venkata@thecrimson.com.

Many people believe that in order to be a Crimson Arts Executive you have to be well-versed in arts and culture, but that’s not true — all you need to know is how to type “flawed but compelling” and sprinkle it in your reviews. But if you are feeling insecure about your cultural appraising skills, I’ve rounded out a list of books that you don’t have to have read in order to have an opinion.
5. “The Twilight Saga” by Stephanie Meyers*
Even though this is one of the greatest young adult book series of all time, I’ll be honest — you could just as easily watch its movie series adaptation, a riveting and accurate portrayal that includes the most talented cast of its time. Its actors may look constantly constipated but Anna Kendrick, Kristen Stewart, and Rob Pattinson went on to have brilliant careers. “Twilight” is so epic that even when minor characters like Billy die, you will find yourself in tears. No wait, was that Harry?
4. “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez 
Don’t read this unless you are ready to make a very large diagram to track the characters and their various generations of offspring. If someone can ever tell me how one of those Aureliano is related to Renata Remedios, I’d be very grateful.
3. “Anna Karenina” by Leo Tolstoy
If you ever do try to tackle this book, only read the first sentence, the parts from the dog’s point of view (25 pages), and the parts about the farming (300 pages). That comes up to reading about a third of it, which is basically reading the whole thing. Surely nothing is more important than understanding the mechanization of 19th century agriculture.
2. “Ulysses” by James Joyce
What makes “Ulysses” so highbrow? You have to read at least four other books to understand it. Skip all of it, because even though nothing actually happens in the plot, Joyce still manages to write over a thousand pages. Also half of these pages are littered with gibberish: “BRONZE BY GOLD HEARD THE HOOFIRONS, STEELYRINING IMPERthnthn thnthnthn.” Bless you!
1. “Les Misérables” by Victor Hugo
Sure, this classic novel that also happens to be my favorite is a beautiful and epic depiction of the June Rebellion of 1832, but it is also over a thousand pages. And that’s if it’s just an English translation. Seriously, why read this when you can watch Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean? Just be sure that when you talk about the actual book, you don’t reference how good the “Bring Him Home” number was.
*“The Twilight Saga” is comprised of four books — this is not cheating, I swear.
—Outgoing TV Executive Aline G. Damas ’20 would actually recommend you read all these books someday — plus all of the works of the Bronte sisters, Shakespeare, and Jane Austen.

10. "Game of Thrones," Season Eight
Say what you will about its ending, but “Game of Thrones” enraptured an international audience over its stunning nine year run. The epic fantasy series came to an end this spring, and although its finale left something to be desired, it left us with plenty of memorable moments. We got intimate portrayals of beloved characters awaiting their collective doom in “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” and a massive, beautifully shot battle in “The Long Night.” No show will capture our collective attention like “Game of Thrones” for a long time, if ever again. —Connor S. Dowd
We reviewed Season Eight’s premiere with mixed opinions. Read more here.
9. "Derry Girls," Season Two and Three
Looking for an upbeat and infectious Netflix binge? Well, look no further: “Derry Girls” has you covered. Set in Derry, Northern Ireland during The Troubles, the show couldn’t have a setting in starker contrast to the giddy antics of its leading ladies. Erin Quinn (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) and her gang of Catholic school girlfriends (plus one oft-bullied boy) navigate dating, drugs, and family drama under the watchful eye of Sister Michael (Siobhan McSweeney). Just wait until the girls get paired up with “buddies” from a nearby Protestant boys’ school — you’ll laugh so hard your Irish eyes will start cryin’. —Allison J. Scharmann
8. "Barry," Season Two
“Saturday Night Live” impressions genius Bill Hader has teamed up with Alec Berg to create one of the best and bleakest comedies in recent memory. Hader plays Barry, a veteran-turned-hitman who travels to LA to take out another target. When he stumbles into an acting class, he becomes entranced by the prospect of reinvention on and off the stage. With endearing earnestness, he decides to pursue acting professionally, but struggles to overcome his checkered past. We can’t forget that Barry is a selfish murderer, but who can fault him for wanting not just to get by, but to live fully? —Claire N. Park
7. "Pose," Season Two
Returning for a second season, Ryan Murphy’s FX series “Pose” follows the lives of queer and trans people of color in New York City’s ballroom scene in the 1980s and 90s at the height of the HIV epidemic. While the first season focused on the underground aspects of ballroom culture, Season Two navigates the scene as it becomes mainstream with the release of Madonna’s “Vogue” and also addresses civil disobedience as the House of Evangelista becomes active in the rising gay rights movement. Season Two’s most remarkable feats are its research-backed writing and references to real events in queer history. —Annie Harrigan
6. "Chernobyl"
“Chernobyl” questions the cost of lies at a time when truth seems open to interpretation. In doing so, writer-creator Craig Mazin is not afraid to show the consequences of telling inconvenient truths. Over the course of five hours, both bureaucrats and scientists face insurmountable hurdles in their heroic efforts to contain the literal fallout from the 1986 nuclear disaster. At every step, they confront an equally incompetent and horrific Soviet government, desperate to maintain their control at all costs. The final product is a chilling reminder that no good deed goes unpunished. —Jack M. Schroeder
5. "Stranger Things," Season Three
This summer, Netflix dropped another season of “Stranger Things,” The Duffer Brothers’ nostalgic brainchild that, three years ago, joined the ranks of “House of Cards” and “Orange in the New Black” as a top-tier Netflix Original. In the third season, the kids are kids no longer; set two years after the first season, the gang faces the usual array of mysterious alien threats, but also grapples with relationship drama, growing up, and Russian infiltrators. No matter how many references to 1980s culture The Duffer Brothers try to cram in, the characters remain the heart of the show.—Kalos K. Chu
4. BoJack Horseman," Season Six
Who knew animation could be the perfect outlet for black comedy, existential dread, and the exploration of trauma? In the first half of its final season, “BoJack Horseman” proves why it’s been a cult favorite since 2014: Its social commentary is sharp, hilarious, and doesn’t leave anyone out. It casts a critical light on all its human and anthropomorphic animal characters, particularly BoJack (Will Arnett), who hides out in rehab to avoid the consequences of his actions. Whether he likes it or not, it looks like they’re coming his way in the second half of the season, which will premiere on Jan. 31, 2020. —Kaylee S. Kim
We reviewed the sixth season of “Bojack Horseman” and had mixed thoughts. Read more here.
3. "The Good Place," Season Four
In the final season of “The Good Place,” the stakes are higher than ever, with, literally, the fate of humanity in the hands of Eleanor (Kristen Bell) and the gang. Creator Michael Schur (“Parks and Recreation,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) brings back the ensemble cast of funny, idiosyncratic characters that we’ve come to love. In addition to the consistently hilarious writing, we see the completion of their arcs, a four season-long payoff that is sure to leave viewers (and moral philosophers, alike) wanting more. —Kalos K. Chu
We reviewed the season four premiere and found it complex and convoluted — but in a good way. Read more here.
2. "Euphoria," Season One
Bona fide triple-threat Zendaya made waves this summer with her brilliantly chaotic turn as Rue Bennett, a recovering teenage drug addict, in the glistening first season of HBO’s “Euphoria.” Rue and her high school peers — Jules Vaughn (Hunter Schafer), Maddy Perez (Alexa Demie), and Kat Hernandez (Barbie Ferreira) are the show’s biggest scene stealers — rip Juuls, ride bikes, and deliver one-liners sharper than their eyeliner in one of the most deft depictions of Gen-Z suburbanites on the small screen to date. Season Two better drop soon — Twitter will not be held waiting. —Allison J. Scharmann 
1. "Fleabag," Season Two
Everyone is talking about “Fleabag,” and rightfully so. The second and final season of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s BBC dramedy about a woman known only as “Fleabag” may very well be one of the best seasons of television ever produced. Season Two took home six Emmys in September — three of which were for Waller-Bridge, who created, wrote, and starred in the show. Watch Fleabag fall for TV’s hottest priest (Andrew Scott) and fight with its most insufferable godmother (Olivia Coleman). Breaking the fourth wall, Fleabag sums it up best: “This is a love story.” The finale will have you in tears. —Allison J. Scharmann
We called “Fleabag” a “comedic triumph.” Read more here.

10. "Lover" by Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift may have gotten snubbed at the Grammys this year, and she may have attracted controversy for her portrayal of the BGLTQ community, and she may still be fighting over who owns her catalogue — but despite it all, “Lover” represents a towering return to Swift’s previous form. After “Reputation”’s edgier ambience, “Lover” gave Swift’s listeners something bubbly, sugar-sweet, and — reassuringly — thoughtful. Highlights include the thrumming baseline in “Cruel Summer” and the pure goofiness of “London Boy.” Whether you love “Lover” or you hate it, Swift had us all following along once again in 2019. —Iris M. Lewis
We reviewed “Lover” and gave it 3 stars. Read more here.
9. “Heard It In A Past Life” by Maggie Rogers
Maggie Rogers’ debut album “Heard It In A Past Life” is slow-burning, hopeful, and wise beyond its years. Its rich, mesmerizing sound blends powerful drums with airy background vocals, abstract synths with ballad-like piano, and painful vulnerability with genuine hope. Rogers’ resilience rings throughout the album, and with an optimism that’s rare among her peers, she crafts an ode to overcoming that only gets better with each replay. Whether you loved Rogers’ breakout single “Alaska” or have never heard of her, this self-described “witchy feminist rockstar” is not one to miss. —Joy C. Ashford
We gave “Heard It In A Past Life” 5 stars. Read more here.
8. "When I Get Home" by Solange
At 19 songs in 39 minutes, Solange’s “When I Get Home” makes her audience sit with contradiction. The album is concise and expansive; it is meandering and severe; it is enigmatic and comprehensive. The “home” in question is Houston, literally, but the album offers a broader look at roots and returns. “Almeda,” for example, is both a reference to a Houston locale and a multi-artist collaborative ode to Texas ’90s hip-hop. “I saw things I imagined / I saw things I imagined,” Solange writes — and her fourth album reimagines what a song by Solange can look like. —Iris M. Lewis
We reviewed “When I Get Home” and gave it 4.5 stars. Read more here.
7. “MAGDALENE” by FKA Twigs
Five years have elapsed since FKA Twigs’ last full-length release, and as expected, she did not disappoint. At a tight nine tracks and 38 minutes long, “MAGDALENE” is a clear-eyed lament of a lost relationship, universalized beyond the tabloid fodder that has trailed Twigs since she was first linked to a certain strong-jawed vampire. The album is at turns intimate and thumping, plaintive and ornate, tuned seamlessly into the lush, enchanting cadence of Twigs’ vocals. “Would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?” Twigs asks on standout track “sad day.” Who wouldn’t? —Amelia F. Roth-Dishy
6. "Cheap Queen" by King Princess
College-aged phenom King Princess gained a new royal title this fall with “Cheap Queen” — and the album has only cemented her claim to the throne. The silky, occasionally aloof debut maintains all of King Princess’s preexisting poise: She drawls about competing with men. Her voice cracks, breathless, as she sings about waiting for a text. And the album is exactly as queer as its cover, which features King Princess in drag makeup, suggests. “I can be good sometimes / I’m a cheap queen / I can be what you like,” King Princess sings. If her debut is any indication, she’s probably right. —Iris M. Lewis
We reviewed “Cheap Queen” and gave it 4 stars. Read more here.
5. "thank u, next" by Ariana Grande
Released just six months after her Grammy-winning “Sweetener,” Ariana Grande’s fifth studio album “thank u, next” is marked by an intense vulnerability and further solidified her reputation as this generation’s pop queen. The singer faced tragic, emotionally challenging circumstances the past two years, yet “thank [you][U], next” makes a strong statement of resilience and strength in the face of grief, all while featuring some of the most iconic singles of the year. Ditching duets and guest artists, Grande’s silky, gentle voice feels more intimate and conversational than ever, proving that Grande’s career continues to move on an upward trajectory. —Samantha J. O’Connell 
Read our review of “thank u, next" here.
4. "IGOR" by Tyler, the Creator
If “Flower Boy” marked Tyler, the Creator’s metamorphosis from controversial up-and-comer to prodigious artiste, “IGOR” solidifies his status as an undeniable artist at the peak of his powers. The rapper whose early work dabbled in casual misogyny and homophobia proved his impressive growth by producing a masterful concept album, almost devoid of traditional rapping, about unrequited love. Collaborations from peers like Playboi Carti and Kanye West blend seamlessly into the broader vision of the album without stealing Tyler’s spotlight, underscoring the fact that, against all odds, Tyler, the Creator has become a bona fide pop star. —Connor S. Dowd ‘22
We reviewed Tyler, the Creator’s set at this year's Governors Ball here.
3. “Norman Fucking Rockwell!” by Lana del Rey
“L.A. is in flames, it’s getting hot / Kanye West is blond and gone,” Lana del Rey laments in the eleventh track of “Norman Fucking Rockwell!” Del Rey’s fifth studio album, released in August, marked an apocalyptic elegy for lost American dreams in the wake of postmodern nightmares. “NFR!” draws on del Rey’s southern-California folk rock nostalgia, mythologizing ‘60s and ‘70s Americana — Laurel Canyon ladies “[wear] black to their house parties,” while songwriters party and play the Eagles in Malibu. California summers feel endless, but in 14 tracks, del Rey rode out the last heat wave with a bang. —Caroline A. Tsai
We wrote a think piece on Lana Del Rey’s Twitter feud with NPR music critic Ann Powers. Read it here.
2. “Cuz I Love You" by Lizzo
Lizzo inhabits a unique space today: People can’t quite decide whether to describe her as “underrated” or “overrated.” This ambiguity is due in part to a phenomenon in which her older songs are slowly going viral, while some of her best work — like the songs featured on “Cuz I Love You” — remain overlooked. From the powerfully cutting vocals of “Jerome” to the feelgood funk of “Juice,” the album has something for everyone. Given Lizzo’s current trajectory of delayed recognition, we’ll just have to wait a couple years for these songs to be appreciated for the masterpieces that they are. —Hunter T. Baldwin
We’re not unanimous in our love of Lizzo’s “Cuz I Love You" — our editor gave it 2 stars. Read more here.
1. “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO?” by Billie Eilish
Billie Eilish is one smart 17 year old. Her latest album perfects her meticulous, idiosyncratic sound — part vulnerable, part genuinely upsetting. Ranging from unforgettable, shock-factor hits to breathy, minimalist piano ballads, the album shows off her range, genius, and terrifying imagination in due turn. Her songs push every boundary, bringing horror-nightmare fantasies to life with her biting vocals and eerie instrumentals. Is “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO?” the best album of 2019, or just the most difficult to look away from? Either way, her smarter, scarier strain of sad-girl pop isn’t going anywhere. —Joy C. Ashford
We reviewed “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO?" and gave it 4.5 stars. Read more here.

10. “The Lighthouse”
This portrait of 1890s lightkeepers Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) studies the madness that comes from boredom at sea. Drawing upon deep cultural myths — “Bad luck to kill a seabird,” Wake tells Winslow, virtually quoting “Rime of the Ancient Mariner” — the film is a thoughtful reimagining of what it meant to live in Atlantic isolation at the turn of the century. With hardly any plot and no other actors, Dafoe and Pattinson lead us through two hours of superstition and fright, enacting Wake’s opening observation: “Doldrums, doldrums, eviler than the devil.” —Isabel C. Ruehl 
We reviewed “The Lighthouse” and gave it 4.5 stars. Read more here.
9. “Hustlers”
Though it initially appears to be a glitzy dive into the lives of a group of strippers, “Hustlers” is actually an investigation of how these women with seemingly little power turn this profession on its head after the 2008 recession. Featuring a star-studded and magnetic cast of actresses and artists including Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, and Cardi B, this film is both bold and refreshing. What makes it that much better is Jennifer Lopez’s stellar performance, which is already generating much-deserved Oscar buzz. —Aline G. Damas
8. “The Irishman”
Although it retains much of what made Scorsese’s earlier works great (such as the indulgent lifestyle of “Goodfellas”) and features the most iconic actors of the genre (Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci), “The Irishman” succeeds most as an evolution in the gangster genre. At its core is a story of friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and the crippling costs of such an inhumane lifestyle. “The Irishman” remains in constant conversation with Scorsese’s filmography, and its sobering, heartbreaking conclusion is a reminder as to why the acclaimed director continues to be such a groundbreaking auteur 46 years after “Mean Streets." —Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed “The Irishman” at the New York Film Festival and gave it 5 stars. Read more here.
7. “Midsommar”
Following 2018’s critically acclaimed “Hereditary” about a disintegrating family, director Ari Aster had big shoes to fill for his next horror installment. This time, in “Midsommar,” Aster traces a rather toxic relationship crumbling as couple Dani and Christian tag along with friends who are visiting a rural Swedish midsummer festival. The village’s traditions turn from quaint to sinister, dragging the Americans into a terrifying competition for survival. Contrasting the increasingly disturbing imagery with the gorgeous, highly-saturated colors of the environment, Aster delivers one of the most beautiful horror films ever, equal parts sickening and captivating. —Samantha J. O’Connell
6. “Ad Astra”
“Ad Astra” is a space epic that fittingly joins the ranks of the most immersive — and most thoughtful — standouts in the science fiction genre. Brad Pitt gives a career-defining performance as Roy McBride, traversing shock, loneliness, and fear in a role that thrives off of restrained subtlety. As McBride ventures further into space, the film’s messages draw closer to humanity; from a thematic study on fatherhood to focusing on making the most of the present, director James Gray takes an introspective and breathtakingly-shot look into what it means to be human. —Lanz Aaron G. Tan 
We reviewed “Ad Astra” and gave it 5 stars. Read more here.
5. “Avengers: Endgame”
Look up “Avengers: Endgame” today and you’ll find dozens of articles still buzzing about the film seven months after its release. While it might not be a certain Italian-American filmmaker's cup of tea, the now highest-grossing film of all time achieved exactly what it set out to do — it got the world talking and made a whole lot of money along the way. Not only does this satisfying conclusion to 11 years of build-up mark a momentous cinematic achievement, but it also gives Robert Downey Jr. the chance to shine in an unparalleled character study of one of the world’s greatest superheroes. —Hunter T. Baldwin
We wrote about Iron Man's character arc. Read more here.
4. “Us”
The highly-anticipated spiritual successor to “Get Out,” Jordan Peele’s “Us” is a horror-shrouded look at society and class structures. “Us” follows the Wilson family as they take a vacation to Santa Cruz, California. Unfortunately for the Wilsons — and everyone else in the United States — demons from matriarch Adelaide’s (Lupita Nyong’o) childhood return and the family has to fend off scissor-wielding doppelgangers. Unlike “Get Out,” “Us” contains more classic horror film tropes like jump scares, gore, and a creepy theme park. Like its predecessor, “Us” delivers political commentary through a chilling psychological thriller. —Annie Harrigan
We reviewed “Us” and gave it 4.5 stars. Read more here.
3. “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood”
Perhaps the most talked-about movie of the summer, “Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood” is Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to Los Angeles. For nearly three hours, the film meanders through the Hollywood Hills and studio movie lots until it abruptly turns into the over-the-top, nearly comical violence that characterizes a Tarantino film. For a movie that can’t decide if it’s an homage to old Hollywood or a retelling of the Manson murders, it’s still three hours that you won’t want to miss. —Caroline E. Tew
We reviewed “Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood” and gave it 4 stars. Read more here.
2. “Parasite”
The best “Parasite” review you will read will be a strongly-worded injunction to just go and see it (director Bong Joon-ho has been rightfully adamant about preventing spoilers in reviews). The only way to write about the film is to write around it: It serves as a reminder that we’re all helplessly ensnared by, and responsible for, the psychic condition that is capitalism, as class tensions bubble over in a disquieting urban Korean setting. Then there is the delicious and sickening thrill of an unforeseeable plot twist that, like an avalanche, drags down everything in its wake. — Claire N. Park
We reviewed “Parasite” at Cannes Film Festival and gave it 4 stars. Read more here.
1. “Booksmart”
Gone are the trite archetypes and drama that plague teen movies — Olivia Wilde’s feature directorial debut, “Booksmart,” is an electrically sincere and hilarious story about two girls’ last hurrah before their high school graduation. The central lesson is the realization that nobody’s a stereotype — including, for the comedic duo, the dumb jock going to Stanford. Starring Beanie Feldstein (of “Lady Bird” fame) and Kaitlyn Dever, “Booksmart” is like “Superbad,” but better: With a witty, feminist screenplay and stellar cast, it’s an exploration into the complexities of female friendships that cements the teen movie as one of the most promising genres to date. — Kaylee S. Kim
We interviewed Kaitlyn Dever, Beanie Feldstein, Katherine Silberman, and Olivia Wilde. Read more here.

10. “How To Do Nothing,” by Jenny Odell 
Odell tells it bluntly: Looking at screens often happens at the expense of everything else. She asks what it would be like to observe the world more, take things in slowly, and feel present. It sounds like hippie mumbo jumbo, but for those familiar with the terms “burnout,” “Slack message,” and “action items,” “How To Do Nothing” is a strong antidote to the chaos and destabilizing feel of 21st-century life. It leans heavily on theory, but take it in slowly, as it was meant to be, and Odell’s urge to pay attention to the world will sink in even more deeply. —Cassandra Luca
9. “The Topeka School” by Ben Lerner
There’s a reason Ben Lerner’s newest semi-autobiographical novel is on the New York Times Book Review’s top 10 books of 2019. “The Topeka School” focuses on Adam Gordon, a 17-year-old high school debater and aspiring poet living in Kansas in the ’90s. Adam finds himself floating between two groups, a largely blue-collar crowd and an elite clique, during his senior year of high school. Lauded for its deft imagery and deep character development, “The Topeka School” is a thorough and fascinating look at masculinity and the power of language. —Aline G. Damas
We reviewed “The Topeka School” and gave it 4.5 stars. Read more here.
8. “The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood
This year, the world couldn’t get enough of Margaret Atwood. Although it’s been over three decades since “The Handmaid’s Tale” was published, Atwood returns to Gilead in her latest novel, “The Testaments.” In the wake of the book’s TV adaptation on Hulu, it’s no surprise that this novel generated so much buzz. Though one of several sequels to beloved favorites of the past published this year (think “Find Me” and “Olive, Again”), “The Testaments” stands out for its critical acclaim, even tying with “Girl, Woman, Other” to win the Booker Prize earlier this year. —Caroline E. Tew
7. "Black Leopard, Red Wolf" by Marlon James
Marlon James quipped that “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” is “an African ‘Game of Thrones.’” The end result, though, is anything but a spin-off. James demands readers’ attention as he introduces hundreds of characters in a world that leaves many things unexplained. The poetry of his sentences introduces Tracker, the protagonist, and begs the reader to listen to his story. That story isn’t entirely true, and James challenges readers to find where Tracker lies to save face. Overall, “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” demands more of its audience than “Game of Thrones” — and is all the better for it. —Jack M. Schroeder
We reviewed "Black Leopard, Red Wolf" and gave it 4 stars. Read more here.
6. “The Nickel Boys,” by Colson Whitehead
“The Nickel Boys” follows the lives of young men locked away at a disciplinary institution, throwing the horrors of racism into the spotlight. The novel becomes even more discomfiting after doing some Googling: The institution in Florida on which Whitehead modeled the fictional version only closed in 2011. Whitehead’s novel is an homage to the boys who died there, and a reminder of how the past remains present. Read to the end: The twist has the effect of a gunshot. Prepare to cry and look at 21st-century America with different eyes after turning the last page. –Cassandra Luca
We reviewed “The Nickel Boys" and gave it 4 stars. Read more here.
5. “City of Girls” by Elizabeth Gilbert
Over a decade after Gilbert graced readers with “Eat, Pray, Love” comes a historical fiction novel that’s just peachy. “City of Girls” follows Vivian Morris during the 1940s as she navigates life in the NYC theater scene after getting kicked out of Vassar College, much to her parents’ dismay. Although largely focused on the years of World War II, “City of Girls” spans decades. Along with a great sense of history, this novel interrogates what it means to be a woman with sexual desires in a society that rejects exactly that. —Caroline E. Tew
4. “Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion” by Jia Tolentino 
Over nine, well-syncopated essays on everything from religion to athleisure, New Yorker critic Jia Tolentino asserts herself as the preeminent bard of the raised-online generation. The 31-year-old is a bit of a wunderkind, and writes with a comforting confidence on our deep-fried digital landscape, even as she works inside it: “I don’t know what to do with the fact that I myself continue to benefit from all this,” she admits. Yet “all this” — our era’s delusions and distortions — needs Tolentino’s writing to make sense of itself. When she delivers the internet’s final exegesis, the link will certainly crash. —Amelia F. Roth-Dishy 
3. “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous” by Ocean Vuong
Poet Ocean Vuong‘s narrative prose debut takes the form of an epistolary novel: a collection of letters from a Vietnamese-American son to his illiterate mother, a survivor and emigrant of the Vietnam War. Through vignettes, Vuong explores the mother-son relationship, the aftermath of trauma, and the closeness that writing can effect, whether or not it’s read and understood: “[W]e, after all, are so close, the shadows of our hands, on two different pages, merging.” —Isabel C. Ruehl 
2. “Trust Exercise,” by Susan Choi
The title of Houston, Tex., native Susan Choi’s latest novel, “Trust Exercise,” is exquisitely reflective of the book itself. A fiction novel set in a performing arts high school (like the one Choi attended) which could easily be set in the author’s hometown, it contemplates the psychological experience and trust involved in reading fiction. It exposes the ways in which it can seem that “the created world is realer than you are,” as a narrator within the text questions a fictional account of her own story. Described by The New Yorker and NPR as “thrillingly interesting” with “audacious narrative twists,” Choi’s novel simultaneously constructs and deconstructs reality. —Shruthi Venkata
1. “Normal People,” by Sally Rooney
After much buzz in the United Kingdom, Irish writer Sally Rooney — heralded “Salinger for the Snapchat generation” — became famous stateside with the publication of her sophomore novel, “Normal People.” The mesmerizing story of two Dublin university students, “Normal People” grapples with love in the time of late capitalism, specifically post-Celtic Tiger Ireland. As Marianne and Connell mature from high school to university, Rooney brings her protagonists together and tears them apart with the unforgiving frequency of natural disaster. Critics noted Rooney’s signature prose style — blunt, lucid, and conversational, it presents a modern update to the Victorian novel’s epistolary tendencies. —Caroline A. Tsai

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Arts readers,
We are proud to present the 2019 Arts Year-in-Review — an annual round-up of the best films, albums, TV shows, and books of the year.
In the six years since the first edition of this supplement, Arts readership numbers have been steadily climbing (and in turn, our GPAs steadily falling — don’t tell our mothers). At the start of our tenure in January, we made it our goal to hit one million clicks by the end of the year. We know what you’re thinking — us? One million? Who do we think we are — Kylie Jenner singing “rise and shine” or Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello pretending to make out on Instagram? We could never reach that kind of Internet stardom!
Well, reader, at the time of this letter, we are on the cusp of making history. (We know, cliffhangers are irritating. But what can we say? We’re committed to journalistic ethics.) We’re so close we can taste it!
In short, we’ve had quite the momentous year. In our relentless pursuit of virality, we covered territory as varied as Cupcakke’s retirement and Lil Pump’s unofficial Harvard commencement speech. We published a spring supplement on art and fashion, as well as a summer supplement on art about love. We even got celebrity shout-outs from Neil Gaiman and Caroline Calloway themselves, whose contributions to pop culture are, ahem, equally substantive. Our reporting took us to Cannes and New York, from literally dark hijinks in Westeros to adolescent antics in Riverdale.
That’s right, Arts has definitely made it to the big leagues. And we couldn't have done without our wonderful team of execs and our talented staff writers, as well as our amazing designers Mireya C. Arango '20 and Ashley Bryant '22 and our multimedia execs Mariah Dimalaluan '20 and Naomi Castellon-Perez '21.
Before we bid our final adieu, we’d like to say good luck to our successors, the wonderful Iris M. Lewis ’21 and Allison J. Scharmann ’21, whose tenure as comp directors has been unparalleled (trust us, we used to be in their shoes). We know Arts will be safe with you (just don’t feed it too much sugar, and its bedtime is at midnight) — and we’re so excited to see how much you’ll achieve next year.
If you need us, we’ll be sunning ourselves* on vacation in the Maldives**.
*weeping over our theses
**in the shadowy, sunless depths of Lamont
Onto the next million!
Arts love,
Kaylee S. Kim ’20 and Caroline A. Tsai ’20

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember wondering, in the few short moments before I shared my Harvard acceptance with anyone else, how I would ever be able to live up to the opportunity. I knew that I had just been handed an extraordinary gift, but I worried that I didn’t deserve it.
It’s an unanswerable question, how we should best make use of the immense privileges we have been handed as Harvard students. I think everyone, at one point or another, has wondered what got us here.
Like many other freshmen, I submitted a form online requesting to view my admissions file, a decision that has become controversial in recent years. I imagined that my admissions file, with its pages of cryptic notes, scores, and abbreviations, might hold answers that would help me in the future.
I soon found myself in a conference room in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar's Office with a surprisingly thin folder in my hands. I had assumed that I would feel like a voyeur into my own life, that I would need to fight off the feeling that I was somehow betraying my recommenders and my alumni interviewer. (Admissions files include the report from the alumni interviewer but, if you’ve waived FERPA as I did, you won’t see your faculty recommendations.) I didn’t feel any of those things.
I expected to see discussion of my extracurricular activities and the number of AP exams I had taken, but found nothing more than a cursory acknowledgement of those elements of my application. I didn’t think I had connected to my alumni interviewer (especially after telling her that I hated “Hamlet,” only to discover that she was a professor of English, specializing in Shakespeare) but she hadn’t held my blunder against me. One admissions reader seemed concerned with the rigor of my academic schedule and demanding extracurriculars, but noted that my apparent joyfulness was reassuring.
There was one aspect of my file, one piece of my high school story, that the admissions officers emphasized in their comments, and it was not the classes I took or the extracurriculars I was involved in.
It was, instead, a situation concerning academic integrity that I found myself in in high school in which I had to decide, quite simply, between trusting my gut and taking the easy way out. I was in a situation in which I had to react, and I had to do so without being able to predict the consequences of my reaction. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, privy to information about others that I didn’t want to know. And while I didn’t want to know it, there was no escaping the fact that I knew now and felt strongly that I had to act. Ironically, I remember wondering if being in that wrong place at that wrong time might undermine my ability to get into college when the time came.
My mom recently reminded me that I often referred to that night as “the worst night of high school,” the night when I saw the neat order I perceived in the world begin to unravel farther than it had before, the night that forced me to define my own values for myself.
While I spent four sleepless years focused on AP classes (when to take them, how many to take), the admissions officers seemed to be valuing not the decisions that I consciously made, but rather what I did not try to do, what type of person I was when things didn’t go according to plan, when I was caught in a situation with no roadmap and had to decide what type of person I was going to be. I’m not saying here that I got into Harvard because I made the “right” decision during a difficult time. To this day, I don’t know what the “right” decision would have been. Rather, the admissions officers cared that I was willing to wrestle with the complexities of the situation.
We have all been trained in one way or another to follow the “steps” to success. We take that class we don’t want to take (for me, that was multivariable calculus my senior year of high school). We get too little sleep and tell interviewers what we think sounds smart, only to discover that we’ve just insulted their life’s work. We talk about graduate school or professional school as if it’s the prize at the end of a sequence of decisions we make correctly. And there’s no doubt that those decisions might be part of the puzzle. There’s no doubt that success is built on a foundation of concrete accomplishments.
But reading my admissions file offered proof that there’s so much more that matters, that leaning into the complexities of our experience as students has importance that transcends numbers and statistics. The unraveling I experienced on that night, that messiness and all that came with it, mattered to the admissions committee — it mattered so much that it just might be the reason I’m sitting in Annenberg right now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William Faulkner famously advised aspiring writers to “Read, read, read. Read everything — trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it… Read! You’ll absorb it.” In fairness to Faulkner, reading more is usually a good thing in the end. But in addition to encouraging our students to read more, we should also be teaching them more thoroughly how to read in the first place.
As kids, most of us learn how to look at words on a page and understand their meaning, but learning to read involves much more than that — it means learning how to deliberately use concrete strategies like annotation to get the most out of a text. Helping students discover how best to use these strategies can help them read at a higher level, take ownership of their reading ability, and, with any luck, enjoy reading much more.
When we think of reading as an ability that we develop once when we’re young and then use when we’re older, it can be easy to see it as a fixed skill. But in reality, we are always learning to read more efficiently and with greater comprehension. More importantly, though, we’re always learning to think more thoroughly about a text and to consider how it applies to us as people.
The point of reading is not just to acquire information, but to make connections, to think hard about complex problems, and to reconsider some of the things we take for granted. Many of the best books of all time, of course, contain no information at all, and reading them is therefore certainly not just a question of efficiently acquiring facts. We’re really always learning to read “better” — in such a way that our reading experience will make minute-to-minute life more interesting and exciting.
Annotation is one strategy that can help us do that, and students should be introduced to it at a young age and continuously guided as they get older. When students underline, they slow down to discern what is important. When they make symbols and arrows, they blend their own ways of thinking with those of the author. When they write notes in the margin, they engage in a dialogue with the text through thoughts, questions, and connections.
While it remains unclear whether certain specific reading strategies can produce better results than others, research has shown that readers who actively engage with a text get much more out of it. Researchers Patricia A. deWinstanley and Elizabeth L. Bjork found that readers remembered more from a passage that featured partially incomplete words than from a normal text. Like students who engage via annotation, participants who were asked to take part in generating the passage’s content by filling in the blanks recalled more as a result.
More importantly, however, the process of actively engaging with a text can also help people read better in the future. In the same study, deWinstanley and Bjork found that once people had witnessed the benefits of generating content for themselves, they read more actively afterward even without the partially incomplete words. When we begin to see reading as a flexible skill that can be improved, we can actively take steps to actually do so.
In that vein, teaching students to annotate can help them take ownership of their reading ability. In his framework of self-regulated learning, researcher Barry J. Zimmerman highlights the important cycle of developing strategies, evaluating those strategies, and devising new strategies for self-regulated learners in any field. Teaching students to annotate is a way of showing them that concrete and deliberate strategies do exist when it comes to reading books. Reading is certainly a skill that students can improve, but when they are not taught active reading strategies it is hard for them to see it that way. Teaching them to annotate allows students to develop a growth mindset around reading — and to realize that through experimentation and practice, they can find their own unique and specific way of enjoying a great book.
Part of the reason reading often loses out to other forms of entertainment today is that reading can be challenging. But teaching students the concrete strategies to take on that challenge can help make reading feel less daunting and more rewarding. Our answer to iPhones and Xbox should not be to simply demand that kids read more. Instead, let’s teach them the strategies that will allow them to see why reading has meant so much to so many for so long.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ strike deadline is upon us and, since a last minute miracle failed to manifest, a picket line across Harvard Yard this morning is inevitable. In the lead up to the strike, both the University and the union's bargaining committee have publicly released their contract proposals — making informed public discourse on the particulars of contract negotiations possible for the first time since negotiations began.
At bare minimum, the proposals confirm what was already evident from statements made by both parties: In terms of the biggest issues, the two parties are, without much exaggeration, miles away from agreement. And while we continue to express our support for HGSU-UAW’s decision, we recognize that this strike will have an immense effect both on campus and nationally, and even more so if it persists.
If the strike is to end any time soon, difficult choices and compromises must be made on both sides. Anything less — small concessions, vague suggestions, floated ideas — will only serve to prolong the stalemate at the bargaining table.
It is critical that both sides have released their respective proposals. Transparency is key to promoting healthy negotiations and productive public discourse. To that end, we would encourage the union to release its full slate of proposals if the online list is not already comprehensive. Only the negotiators have the necessary information and context to fully address the specifics of the proposals and the possibility for compromise. That said, the release of these proposals invites public scrutiny and discourse. And we’d like to share a few initial impressions.
First, we are concerned that the size of the childcare fund the University proposes in the contract barely touches the cost of raising a child in Massachusetts. The $275,000 child care support fund is in no way an adequate sum to draw on, given that the average annual cost of infant care for one child in Massachusetts alone is $17,062. Based on some quick calculations, namely long division, that yields funding for roughly 16.12 children. The University’s additional proposed two percent increase in its Parental Accommodation and Financial Support program, which currently provides a one-time $6,624 stipend for newly born or adopted children of graduate students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, barely touches the problem.
Second, on the part of the union, the proposed six to seven percent annual increase of salary and stipends is considerably above rates found at some peer institutions. For example, at MIT, graduate students saw a three percent increase between 2017 and 2018 — indexing the increase to the cost of living, an action we have previously supported. While the University’s counter-proposal of seven to eight percent over three years might seem too low, the union might look at this compensation package as an area for potential compromise.
More broadly, we encourage both sides to work to break the existing impasse of the negotiations. It may seem obvious, but it’s worth stating nonetheless. Certainly, we hope both sides enjoy a restful holiday with their families, but they must redouble negotiating efforts over winter break, so that the strike does not carry over into the coming semester.
Now that both the University and the union's bargaining committee have publicized their contract proposals, scrutiny by members of the Harvard community at large will play an important role in determining the direction negotiations take in the coming weeks. We encourage members of our community, particularly undergraduates doing paid work on campus, to view both proposals, form an opinion, and to make their voices heard as the strike and negotiations unfold.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union is set to go on strike at 10 a.m. Tuesday after its negotiating committee and Harvard failed to come to any new agreements during a bargaining session Monday morning.
Striking members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers – which represents roughly 5,000 student workers across campus – will halt their teaching responsibilities and forgo paid research work not related to their academic programs starting Tuesday. The strike is expected to last indefinitely.
Union members and supporters will form picket lines in front of Massachusetts Hall in Harvard Yard, the home of the University’s central administration, Tuesday morning. Picket lines are expected to commence at Harvard’s Longwood campus starting Wednesday. HGSU plans to continue their pickets for the rest of the week from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m in Cambridge and from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in Longwood each day.
HGSU announced their Dec. 3 strike deadline last month, after voting members overwhelmingly approved strike authorization in a vote in late October. The union and the University have met in 28 bargaining sessions since October 2018. The two sides have reached tentative agreements on 12 provisions, but remain deadlocked on key issues such as compensation, health care benefits, and sexual harassment and discrimination grievance procedures.
During Monday’s bargaining session — which was added to the calendar last week — the two sides exchanged several proposals, including new counter-proposals from the union on compensation and benefits, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University still believes that a strike is “unwarranted.”
“Student workers have [a] vital role in fulfilling Harvard's teaching and research mission, and with that in mind, the University is committed to addressing concerns that have been raised throughout this process,” Swain wrote. “A strike will neither clarify our respective positions nor will it resolve areas of disagreement.”
The union made substantial changes to its compensation and benefits proposals Tuesday, according to an update posted to the union’s website, but noted that their current proposal must be accepted in its entirety without revisions or it will revert to its original asks.
HGSU is now asking for a 5 percent wage increase this year and 3.5 percent in each subsequent year of the contract. The union had previously requested a 4.25 percent annual wage increase for salaried research assistants and hourly workers, and a 5 percent annual increase for salaried teaching staff.
Union negotiators also reduced their ask on minimum wage to $25 per hour or 5 percent above the current rate for all workers, a decrease from their previous call for $28 to $34 per hour depending on their academic discipline.
The union also altered its proposal on dental coverage and healthcare coverage for members' adult dependents. The new proposals asks for 90 percent premium coverage on dental care and 65 percent on healthcare for adult dependents; the previous proposal called for complete coverage in both areas. HGSU also withdrew proposals for retirement and professional development benefits.
In addition to the scope of coverage, HGSU also changed its proposed threshold for members to be eligible for benefits. Previously, hourly workers who work roughly seven hours per week would receive health benefits, but the new threshold is set at “an average of 17.5 hours/week” in a semester.
“The University is reviewing [HGSU]-UAW's most recent counter proposal on compensation and benefits,” Swain wrote.
He added that there are currently no additional bargaining sessions set.
Since the announcement of the strike authorization vote, University administrators have urged faculty to prepare for the possibility of a strike. Swain wrote that the university has developed contingency plans to ensure “as little disruption as possible” to exams and coursework. Guidance issued by the University has noted that striking student workers may not be paid.
In the event of a strike, student teaching staff could choose to halt their paid instructional work, including holding sections and office hours and grading assignments and exams. Graduate research assistants on strike would withhold 20 hours of their paid research work not related to their academic program.
HGSU has distributed picket sign-up forms in email updates to their members and urged striking members to spend at least 10 hours each week on the picket line. The union will also offer strike benefits if it lasts more than seven days and has set up a hardship fund to assist striking student workers impacted by the loss of pay.
Ahead of the strike, HGSU has also picked up influential allies, including political leaders, alumni, and other campus unions. All eleven members of Massachusetts’ Congressional delegation sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow last month encouraging the University to “ensure fair treatment and strong workplace protections” for student workers. Forty-five alumni from the Class of 1969 also sent a letter supporting the union to top administrators.
Senator and Democratic Presidential Primary Candidate Bernie Sanders (D-V.T.) announced his support for HGSU members in a press release Monday.
“I stand in solidarity with the student workers at Harvard. All workers deserve respect, dignity, a living wage, access to adequate health care, and protection against harassment and discrimination,” Sanders said. “I urge the administration to bargain in good faith for a fair contract.”
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, Harvard’s largest union, encouraged its members to support HGSU in a Nov. 27 email to its members. Though HUCTW workers must continue all of their regular responsibilities, they have been instructed to decline to do work that would “normally be done” by student workers.
“We encourage you to respectfully decline these types of requests, letting managers and faculty know that you do not feel comfortable doing the jobs of striking HGSU-UAW workers,” the email reads.
Roxana Rivera, vice president of custodial and security union 32BJ SEIU, wrote in an emailed statement that her union “stands with” student workers and that it is “unacceptable” that a contract has not yet been reached.
“As the richest University in the country, Harvard can afford to provide good jobs to all of its workers—jobs that take into account the skyrocketing cost-of-living in Boston and the specific concerns and needs of its employees,” Rivera wrote.

A group of Harvard administrators discussed the impacts of recent and upcoming University developments in Allston at a public event at the Harvard Ed Portal Monday evening.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III, and Harvard Allston Land Company CEO Thomas P. Glynn III spoke alongside moderator and Boston City Councilor Mark S. Ciommo. They discussed affordable housing and the resources Harvard offers to Allston and Brighton residents, such as the Ed Portal.
The event came ahead of the opening of Harvard’s new SEAS building in Allston in the fall of 2020 and ongoing development of the proposed Enterprise Research Campus – a University initiative intended to foster collaboration between Harvard-affiliated research projects and “research-focused” companies.
Around 80 people attended the event, which began with remarks from Harvard’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communication Paul Andrew and Ed Portal mentor Grace C. Eysenbach ’20. Each member of the panel also shared their perspective on Harvard’s development in Allston, followed by a question and answer session with Ciommo.
Lapp spoke about Harvard’s history of and commitment to providing programs and resources to Allston-Brighton residents, mentioning University projects including the Ed Portal and the ArtLab, which opened earlier this fall. She described the projects as “a variety of ways which take previously inaccessible areas of Allston and making them inviting places where people can live.”
Doyle showed a short video of the new SEAS building and discussed the potential benefits of having SEAS faculty and students “under one roof” in Allston. He also highlighted a section of SEAS’s mission statement which mentions its “societal impact” globally and locally.
“We went further to delineate this and say this was a societal impact to the world, to the nation and to our local community,” Doyle said.
“We’ve really found a community partner,” he added.
Glynn said he hopes the ERC will become a “destination” in Allston. He also discussed similarities and differences between MIT’s developments in Kendall Square and Harvard’s aims for the ERC.
He also responded to a question about Harvard’s efforts to promote affordable housing in Allston, saying he hopes the residential component of the development will exceed the city of Boston’s mandate that developers must set aside 13 percent of new units for affordable housing.
“We've indicated to the developers in their applications that we thought that was the minimum. We encouraged them to be bolder than that, and I think they've all been responsive,” he said.
To end the evening, Ciommo thanked the audience for attending despite snowy weather, calling the discussion “one of probably many future ones.”

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced the launch of a search for the next dean of the Division of Continuing Education in an email to FAS faculty members Monday.
Current DCE Dean Huntington D. Lambert, who has held the position since 2013, announced his plans to retire at the end of the calendar year earlier this semester. While the search for a new dean is conducted, DCE associate dean and chief innovation officer Henry H. Leitner will serve as interim dean, Gay wrote.
The DCE encompasses Harvard Extension School and its Summer School, as well as a variety of other academic enrichment programs. In her email, Gay discussed the role of the DCE dean in advancing the mission of FAS.
“The dean of the DCE oversees a powerful global education platform and the primary outreach arm for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), serving more than 30,000 part-time learners across the globe each year,” Gay wrote. “With a deep commitment to academic excellence and expanding opportunities for learning and educational innovation, the dean of DCE leads the division in its mission to extend Harvard to part-time and summer learners with the academic ability, curiosity, and drive to succeed in rigorous courses and programs.”
In the email, Gay announced the committee that would lead the search for Lambert’s successor and thanked him for his work as dean.
“His boundless energy and passion for students at every stage of learning has made Harvard stronger and better,” she wrote.
Gay will lead the search committee. University professor Gary King, Philosophy professor Alison Simmons, and Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein will also serve on the committee, along with Dean of Administration and Finance for the FAS Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Bharat N. Anand ‘88, and Vice President and Chief Information Officer Anne H. Margulies.
In a November interview, Lambert highlighted three areas on which he believes his successor should focus — ensuring the DCE represents Harvard well, providing lifelong learning opportunities, and innovating its infrastructure to maintain accessibility.
“We serve a very different student at Harvard. We serve this adult part-time learner, and we serve the summer learners. Those are learners that no other school at Harvard serves, but we're still Harvard,” Lambert said. “What does that mean in terms of the rigor of the courses, the academic discipline on anything we put credit on?”
“This person needs to be Harvard, be the best we can be for our adult part-time and summer learners, and build the information systems that let us do it cost-effectively,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 were inaugurated as the new president and vice president of Harvard’s Undergraduate Council Monday night.
Mathew and White-Thorpe won the UC presidential election in November — beating four other candidate teams — after running on a campaign to promote inclusion, wellness, and safety on campus.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller swore in Mathew and White-Thorpe using “The Harvard Book” Monday night at the Council’s last meeting of the semester.
Mathew and White-Thorpe swore to “diligently execute” their positions and serve as positive role models and voices for undergraduate students. The pair then took their seats at the front of the room and led the rest of the meeting.
“I’m very, very excited to work with all of you, and we think it’s going to be a good year,” Mathew said to UC members at the meeting.
Outgoing UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 gave speeches at the inauguration, reflecting on their tenures on the council and thanking numerous people.
Both Palaniappan and Huesa said during their speeches that the Council needs to improve its image among students. Huesa said that some students still see the UC as a joke and urged UC members to take their work more seriously so the Council can be taken more seriously.
This year, Aditya A. Dhar ’21 and Andrew W. Liang ’21 — a Crimson business associate — ran for the UC presidency and vice presidency on a platform to abolish the UC and garnered the most first-place votes among students, but lost under the Council’s Borda voting system.
Palaniappan and Huesa both teared up during their respective speeches while thanking each other for their support and friendship.
“There’s no one else I would’ve done this crazy journey with other than you,” Palaniappan said to Huesa.
The room gave Palaniappan and Huesa standing ovations after their speeches, and the duo signed their names in a copy of the “The Harvard Book,” a collection of writings about the University. O’Dair said at the inauguration that she hopes to solidify a tradition of outgoing UC presidents and vice presidents signing their names in the book.
The UC also elected new members to fill its executive positions at the meeting Monday. The Council elected Elm Yard Representative Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 as secretary and Dunster House Representative Noah Harris ’22 as treasurer.
Brennan ran on a platform to improve the Council’s efficiency, as well as its communications with the student body. Harris, who ran unopposed, promised to make the Council’s finances more transparent and to change its grant system software.
Brennan’s election marks the first time in several years that a freshman will serve as secretary of the UC. Last year, the Council elected a freshman — Jack M. Swanson ’22 — as treasurer.
Also during the meeting, Lowell House Representative Rachel L. Reynolds ’22, a Crimson blog editor, presented superlatives to UC members, ranging from “Most Likely to Become a Supreme Court Justice” to “Most Likely to be Quoted in The Crimson.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours before the graduate student union strike, the Harvard Graduate Council voted to issue a last-minute statement regarding the ongoing contract negotiations at its last open meeting of the semester.
After 13 months of negotiations, the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers is organizing a University-wide strike starting Tuesday in an effort to secure their contract demands more rapidly. The union has stated the strike will continue indefinitely.
After two failed motions, and rejecting one proposed statement during almost 45 minutes of debate, the council decided Monday night to draft and release what multiple representatives called a “more neutral” public statement.
“Upon clarification of Harvard University administration’s role in contracts and negotiations, we the Harvard Graduate Council call upon the Harvard University administration to bargain a contract with the Harvard Graduate Student Union (HGSU-UAW) that reflects the University’s values of fairness, equality, and justice,” the statement reads.
The council looked to statements issued by the Harvard Law School and Harvard Divinity School student governments to draft its statement, which passed unanimously but for one abstention. HGC will release the statement online and via social media Tuesday morning prior to the strike.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University has prepared contingency plans for the strike.
“Harvard University remains engaged in negotiations with HGSU-UAW and we continue to feel a strike is unwarranted,” Swain wrote. “A strike will neither clarify our respective positions nor will it resolve areas of disagreement.”
The union and the University remain at odds over proposals concerning health care, compensation, and third-party arbitration for harassment and discrimination matters. Contract negotiations began last October, and to date, the two parties have come to an agreement over 12 different proposals.
What began with a standard motion Monday night quickly turned into a divisive full-council debate.
HGC President Bryan O. Buckley presented the first proposal which would have authorized the executive board to issue a statement on the strike “if deemed necessary” in the upcoming weeks.
Multiple representatives immediately rejected this motion and instead called for more urgent action.
“I feel like this is one of the most pressing issues in a couple of years for graduate students,” Divinity School Representative Anna K. Del Castillo said. “Since this is happening tomorrow morning, we would be remiss if we didn’t support our classmates who will be striking.”
After a formal vote dismissing Buckley’s motion, Del Castillo motioned to draft a statement during the meeting with the full board and release it Tuesday. Her proposed statement supported the right to strike, the strike itself, and the union’s demands. Multiple representatives characterized this proposal as “more aggressive.”
“If you put that motion through, you’re supporting everything the union said," HGC Executive Board member Tracie M. Gordon said. "If you do that, the can of worms is going to explode."
Del Castillo’s motion received five votes in the affirmative and three in the negative, failing to pass without a two-thirds majority.
The council eventually settled on drafting a more neutral statement, which was passed unanimously.
Del Castillo, however, said she is still not satisfied with the statement’s final wording.
“I’m gonna be real. Saying the two parties should come together and create something is like, ‘no shit.’ They’ve been doing this for 13 months,” she said. “There’s one party that has the power.”

Harvard students and technology leaders discussed ways to integrate technology into politics at the inaugural Civic Tech Challenge at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics Monday evening.
Lynne A. Sipprelle ’23, chair of the IOP’s Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics program, moderated a panel of six professionals who are involved in developing technology for civic engagement. The panelists included the founder of Outvote Naseem Y. Makiya ’08, Vice President at Higher Ground Labs Teddy Gold, and co-founder of the Politicking App and Harvard Public Service Scholar Jordan Wilson.
Russell L. Mindich ’20, the challenge's organizer, said he created the event to teach undergraduates about civic and political technology.
“I felt that a lot of Harvard’s undergraduate courses and programs at the IOP and other political groups did not really cover the technological aspects of politics and wanted to, one, introduce the themes within it and, two, call upon students to create their own projects,” Mindich said.
In the panel, the technology professionals each described their own innovations for increasing voter participation and educating voters.
Gold said the 2016 election showed that the technological systems that ran political campaigns were outdated. His lab develops new ways for Democratic candidates to reach out to voters and run campaigns.
Makiya said he works on “relational organizing,” or creating digital spaces for activists to organize in any given area or topic.
“Relational organizing is just organizing as it has been done for decades,” Makiya said. “But the buzzword has come to mean engaging volunteers, engaging their friends, and for us it is…creating a platform where volunteers can come in and organize in their communities.”
After the panelists spoke, they judged proposals for new forms of civic technology from Harvard undergraduates.
The first presenters — Sarah S. Yoon ’21, Yanchen “Jeff” Jiang ’21, and Ava Ganik ’19 — created a campaign finance explorer that displays the sources and amounts of funding for any political candidate. The second presenter, Lisa Vo ’19, talked about her company, Grassroutes, an app that promotes local campaigns across the country.
“Candidates at the local level need to make voter contact, and that means face to face, door to door conversations,” Vo said. “And what is missing is that the technology available in political tech today is meant for your federal and Senate candidates.”
Presenter Lawrence H. Dang ’22 said the Legacy Museum in Alabama, which displays the history of American slavery, inspired his idea to build a website called “Truth Maps.” Through his site, he said he wants to educate the public about untold histories on topics like police brutality, environmental destruction, and indigenous history in the Boston area.
“A physical museum can only do so much,” Dang said. “But there are places everywhere to educate the public about untold histories.”
The judges named the students who developed Juntos, a website that provides destinations, services, and resources for asylum seekers, the winners of the competition. They awarded the team — comprised of Britney S. Vongdara ’21; Soyoun Choi ’23; Vivekae M. Kim ’21, a Crimson Magazine editor; and Meena Venkataramanan ’21, a Crimson News editor — with $1,000 and the opportunity to be mentored by the judges.
“We are really honored to have been given the opportunity to participate in the IOP Civic Tech Challenge,” Venkataramanan said, “We spent the summer working on immigration and border issues in Arizona and this is an issue area that really matters to us, so we are really grateful for the opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 3, 2019 at 2:48 a.m.
Harvard’s graduate student union began its strike Tuesday at midnight after more than a year of contract negotiations with the University.
The widely anticipated strike, announced by the union’s bargaining committee last month, followed months of negotiations during which the two parties failed to come to agreements on key provisions, including health care, compensation, and sexual harassment and discrimination grievance procedures. The strike will last indefinitely, according to a union Facebook post Monday evening.
“Harvard administration has failed to produce meaningful responses to our proposals for harassment and discrimination protections, comprehensive and affordable health care, and fair pay. Our indefinite strike begins at midnight tonight,” the union wrote in its post.
Union members – teaching fellows, course assistants, and graduate research assistants – can choose whether to participate in the strike. Striking HGSU members will halt their paid instructional work, including holding sections and office hours and grading assignments and exams, according to strike guidelines distributed by the union last week. Graduate research assistants on strike will withhold 20 hours of their paid research work not related to their academic program.
HGSU announced their Dec. 3 strike deadline last month, after voting members overwhelmingly approved strike authorization in a vote in late October. HGSU and the University have met for 28 bargaining sessions since October 2018. They have thus far reached tentative agreements on 12 contract provisions.
No additional bargaining sessions have been scheduled, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement Monday morning that the University still believes that a strike is “unwarranted.”
“Student workers have [a] vital role in fulfilling Harvard's teaching and research mission, and with that in mind, the University is committed to addressing concerns that have been raised throughout this process,” Swain wrote. “A strike will neither clarify our respective positions nor will it resolve areas of disagreement.”
Swain and union representatives could not immediately be reached for comment early Tuesday morning.
During a bargaining session Monday, the union made substantial changes to its compensation and health care proposals but the two sides have not agreed to anything at this point.
HGSU is now asking for a 5 percent wage increase this year and 3.5 percent in each subsequent year of the contract. The union had previously requested a 4.25 percent annual wage increase for salaried research assistants and hourly workers, and a 5 percent annual increase for salaried teaching staff.
Union negotiators also reduced their ask on minimum wage to $25 per hour or 5 percent above the current rate for all workers, a decrease from their previous call for $28 to $34 per hour depending on their academic discipline.
In addition to compensation, the union altered its proposal on dental coverage and healthcare coverage for members' adult dependents. The new proposals asks for 90 percent premium coverage on dental care and 65 percent on healthcare for adult dependents; the previous proposal called for complete coverage in both areas. HGSU also withdrew proposals for retirement and professional development benefits.
HGSU also changed its proposed threshold for members to be eligible for benefits. Previously, hourly workers who work roughly seven hours per week would receive health benefits, but the new threshold is set at “an average of 17.5 hours/week” in a semester.
“The University is reviewing [HGSU]-UAW's most recent counter proposal on compensation and benefits,” Swain wrote.
He added that there are currently no additional bargaining sessions set.
The University updated its proposal on harassment and nondiscrimination at Monday’s session, including expanding its list of available interim measures in cases where misconduct is alleged, according to a University website dedicated to contract negotiation.
Since the announcement of the strike authorization vote, University administrators have urged faculty to prepare for the possibility of a strike. Swain wrote that the university has developed contingency plans to ensure “as little disruption as possible” to exams and coursework. Guidance issued by the University has noted that striking student workers may not be paid.
HGSU has distributed picket sign-up forms in email updates to their members and urged striking members to spend at least 10 hours each week on the picket line. The union will also offer strike benefits if it lasts more than seven days and has set up a hardship fund to assist striking student workers impacted by the loss of pay.
HGSU members were asked to turn in all work materials, including grade books, papers, and all other materials for courses they teach, according to the union’s guidelines.
Several departments may delay grading or change final exam formats as a result of the strike, according to faculty members across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
HGSU members will continue their personal academic work for the duration of the strike, according to the guidelines. Picket lines outside of buildings are “porous” and strikers will not block people from entering buildings.

The union will also offer strike benefits if it lasts more than seven days and has set up a hardship fund to assist striking student workers impacted by the loss of pay.
Ahead of the strike, HGSU has also picked up influential allies, including political leaders, alumni, and other campus unions.

Bacow last month encouraging the University to “ensure fair treatment and strong workplace protections” for student workers. Forty-five alumni from the Class of 1969 also sent a letter supporting the union to top administrators.

“As the richest University in the country, Harvard can afford to provide good jobs to all of its workers—jobs that take into account the skyrocketing cost-of-living in Boston and the specific concerns and needs of its employees,” Rivera wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 50 students staged a sit-in at University Hall Monday evening to protest the tenure denial of Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña and to call on Harvard to create a formalized ethnic studies program.
García Peña was denied tenure Wednesday, according to an open letter students wrote to University Provost Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay. The letter — which 200 students and 30 student groups had signed onto as of Monday night — asks administrators to reverse that decision; publicly release correspondence about the final decision between Bacow, Gay, and department chair Mariano Siskind; and open an investigation into García Peña’s case for “procedural errors, prejudice, and discrimination.” A separate letter penned by Harvard affiliates and other academics had 972 signatures.
The open letter also connects García Peña’s tenure case to two incidents this semester which the authors claim the University has insufficiently addressed.
In the first, someone left a note at García Peña’s office insulting her ethnicity and challenging her right to be at Harvard. Harvard University Police opened an investigation into the incident, Bacow and Gay announced in September.
In the second, García Peña’s students were installing an art exhibit in Harvard Yard when Harvard University Police questioned the students and asked to see their IDs, engaging in a back-and-forth. At last month’s faculty meeting, Gay called the incident “painful,” adding that FAS would take steps recommended in a report the school commissioned on the incident to remedy the situation.
García Peña did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.
The open letter also calls on administrators to "increase transparency in the tenure review process for all faculty, providing more lines of accountability and greater consideration of the ways in which faculty have contributed to supporting underrepresented students on campus."
The ultimate decision to tenure a faculty member rests with the University President, and tenure review committees do not generally release public information about tenure cases.
Last spring, students launched a letter writing campaign in support of García Peña’s tenure bid, citing her mentorship of Latinx students on campus.
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on García Peña’s tenure decision.
HUPD officers were dispatched to University Hall Monday after receiving a report that “close to 50 protestors” entered the building, according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
“Officers merely observed the protest,” Catalano wrote in an emailed statement. “At the end of it the protestors vacated the building.”
Protesters occupied the lobby of University Hall for 48 minutes to correspond with the 48 years that students have been pushing for the establishment of a formalized ethnic studies program.
The open letter called on Harvard to establish an Ethnic Studies department offering Ph.D.s in Ethnic Studies and concentrations and secondary fields in Native American and Indigenous Studies, Latinx Studies, Asian American Studies, Muslim American Studies, and Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies. The students also demanded the University establish an Ethnic Studies research center.
Gay said upon taking office in fall 2018 that she wanted to recruit faculty who specialize in ethnic studies before creating a formal program. FAS is currently undertaking a faculty search for three or four tenured or tenure-track professors who specialize in Asian American studies, Latinx studies, and Muslim American studies.
The students wrote that García Peña was an “excellent candidate to lead Ethnic Studies initiatives.” They also alleged that some candidates for the ongoing faculty search have “demonstrated intent” to withdraw from consideration in solidarity with García Peña.
“While looking outwardly for faculty members that can conduct and teach Ethnic Studies research, it is absolutely unacceptable to deny Professor García Peña tenure, especially as a member of the search committee herself,” the open letter states. “It is hypocritical for University administrators to claim they are invested in furthering Ethnic Studies scholarship at Harvard while simultaneously denying tenure to a leading Latinx and Ethnic Studies scholar.”
Correction: Dec. 5, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Anna G. Cowenhoven is the University spokesperson. In fact, she is the FAS spokesperson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union is officially on strike after more than a year of negotiations with University administrators. While the two parties have reached 12 tentative agreements after 28 bargaining sessions, they remain at odds over key issues such as compensation, health care benefits, and grievance procedure.
Several other unions on campus have recently offered their support for the striking graduate students, noting that many of the same provisions HGSU is negotiating over are included in every union contract on campus.
Below, The Crimson has analyzed how HGSU and the University’s compensation and benefits proposals compare to existing provisions in other unions’ contracts.
HGSU’s most recent proposal on compensation, which negotiators brought to the table Dec. 2, asks for a 5 percent wage increase this year and a 3.5 percent increase each subsequent year of the contract.
HGSU’s proposal for yearly wage increases most closely matches that of UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents Harvard’s dining hall workers and reached its current contract at the end of a 22-day strike in 2016.
HUDS workers received between a 3.29 and 5.74 percent increase after their first year, and between a 1.04 and 3.70 percent increase in the second year, according to The Crimson’s analysis of their contract.
Members of 32BJ SEIU, which represents Harvard’s custodians and contracted security guards, received a wage increase of between 2.97 to 3.29 percent in the first year of their contract, which was negotiated in 2016. They make between $23.39 and $25.70 per hour, depending on their position and seniority.
HGSU negotiators have asked for a minimum wage of $25 per hour or 5 percent above the current rate for all workers, a decrease from their previous call for $28 to $34 per hour depending on their academic discipline.
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers — Harvard’s largest union — divides its employees into 10 salary grades. In the contract it ratified last year, it negotiated increases of 3.8 percent in the first year and 3.5 percent in the two subsequent years for the maximum and minimum of each grade.
The hourly pay rates for members of the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union increase by 2.25 percent annually, though this increase is accompanied by a flat rate increase, depending on employees’ base wage.
Under the University’s compensation proposal, salaried student research assistants in the Sciences would receive a three percent salary increase this year, and two 2.5 percent salary increases over the next two years, while salaried teaching fellows would receive a two percent salary increase this year, and two 2.5 percent salary increases in the next two years.
HUSPMGU President Curt E. Rheault called Harvard’s proposal “low” given the rate of inflation, cost of living in Boston, and cost of education.
“In my opinion, they need at least a three percent raise, no matter what, just to be above treading water,” Rheault said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Rheault’s characterization of Harvard’s proposal.
HGSU’s current benefits proposals would require the University to cover all eligible student workers’ health insurance premiums and fees, currently totaling $4,906 per year for students, and 90 percent of dental insurance premiums on their current or another substantially similar plan. Harvard’s current student dental coverage plan is currently set to be priced at $279 per student each semester starting in February 2020.
The proposal also asked the University to reimburse 65 and 100 percent of adult and child dependent health insurance premiums, respectively, which current cost $7,718 and $4,100 a year.
Under HGSU’s proposals, out-of-pocket costs for each specialist visit would be capped at $35 for student workers, with Harvard covering the rest of the cost. Eligible student workers’ spending on mental health specialist visits would also be capped at $500 per year.
In other campus unions such as HUCTW, HUSPMGU, and UNITE HERE Local 26, employees in a higher salary grade currently contribute more to their health insurance premiums. For employees in those unions earning less than $55,000 annually, a point-of-service plan – which the Student Health Insurance Plan is – currently costs between $1,476 and $1,716 per year. A similar plan that covers an entire family would cost $3,984 to $4,632 per year.
Dental insurance premiums for an employee or an entire family cost $240 and $672 per year respectively.
HGSU and Harvard have also remained deadlocked over grievance procedures and union membership proposals.
HGSU has demanded that members of its bargaining unit be allowed to use a union grievance procedure – a dispute-resolution mechanism that can lead to third-party arbitration – to handle sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
The University’s proposal, however, explicitly forbids the use of grievance procedures to adjudicate these complaints. Instead, Harvard has insisted that these claims be investigated under its internal Title IX procedures.
Current contracts for some other campus unions, including HUCTW, UNITE HERE Local 26, HUSPMGU, SEIU 32BJ, allow discrimination complaints to be handled through a union grievance procedure.
The University has also proposed that student workers be allowed to choose whether they join the union or not — a system known as an “open shop” arrangement that has been fiercely criticized by members of HGSU's bargaining committee.
HGSU, on the other hand, has proposed an “agency shop” arrangement by including a provision typically known as a “union security clause.” Such a clause would require student workers to pay dues to cover bargaining costs if they chose not to pay union membership dues.
The University has argued that the union’s proposal could result in workers being terminated if they fail to pay fees, leaving them unable to finish their academic program.
With no additional bargaining sessions scheduled, HGSU is set to begin picketing Tuesday morning. The strike is expected to be indefinite depending on the progress of negotiations.
Correction: Nov. 4, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers negotiated increases of 2.3 percent in the first year and 2 percent for various grades of employees. In fact, HUCTW negotiated increases of 3.8 and 3.5 percent, respectively.
Correction: Nov. 4, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that other unions on campus, including HUCTW, receive much lower yearly increases in wages compared to the union's proposed increases. In fact, on average, HUCTW raises are greater than those of other unions on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 4, 2019 at 1:44 a.m.
Members of Harvard’s graduate student union, bundled in winter coats and donning signs, braved heavy snowfall to picket in Harvard Yard Tuesday on their first day of their strike.
Carrying signs reading “UAW on Strike” and chanting “What do we want? Contract! When do we want it? Now!” Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers demonstrators marched from their strike base at Phillips Brooks House Association to Massachusetts Hall just after 10 a.m. They spent the rest of the day transitioning between marching routes throughout the Yard.
The strike officially began at midnight on Tuesday after more than a year of negotiations between Harvard and the union failed to yield agreements on key contract provisions. During a bargaining session Monday both sides offered new proposals, but no new agreements were reached.
HGSU announced their Dec. 3 strike deadline in November after voting members overwhelmingly approved strike authorization in late October. Since bargaining began in October 2018, HGSU and the University have held 28 sessions. They have reached tentative agreements on 12 contract provisions, but remain deadlocked on issues including compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination.
The strike is expected to continue indefinitely, with pickets in Cambridge lasting until 5 p.m on the first day. Starting Wednesday, the union will picket in Cambridge from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. each day. Pickets on Harvard’s Longwood campus in Boston are expected to begin Wednesday and run from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. each day.
Shortly after the strike began, students from classes across the University walked out to join the picket line and participate in a rally featuring HGSU organizers, politicians, and faculty members on the steps of University Hall.
Mass. State Representative Marjorie C. Decker, bullhorn in hand, called on Harvard’s administration to listen to students’ contract demands.
“You are changing the world through your research and through your teaching, and now more than ever, we need you in the classroom, not on the picket line,” Decker said. “I am calling on President Bacow, who has an incredible history of being attuned to social and economic justice. It is who he has been, it is how he has led. He needs to straighten this boat and get it right soon.”
UAW, which serves as the parent union for several university graduate student unions across the country, also sent leaders to support the strike effort.
In her remarks to the demonstrators, UAW regional director Beverley Brakeman told supporters the international union supports its Harvard chapter “all the way.”
“You know what I want to say to Harvard President Bacow sitting over there? ‘Shame on you,’” Brakeman said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment in an emailed statement Tuesday afternoon.
Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74, who marched with strikers in a suit but no coat, said that he was not bothered by the day’s below-freezing temperatures.
“You get warmed up by this kind of solidarity,” West said.
Several political candidates also backed the student workers. United States Senate candidate and labor attorney Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90 marched with protesters as they circulated Mass. Hall early in the afternoon.
Multiple 2020 Democratic Presidential candidates voiced their support for HGSU on Twitter throughout the day Tuesday.
United States Senator and Harvard Law School professor emerita Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julían Castro, Mayor Pete P. M. Buttigieg ’04, and former Vice President Joe Biden all backed the strikers.
Sanders included a photo of him meeting with union organizers during a labor event he held in New Hampshire last week.
“Last week I met with students from @hgsuuaw, and this morning they began their strike,” Sanders wrote. “I stand with them in demanding Harvard's administration to guarantee student workers a living wage, access to adequate health care, and protection against harassment and discrimination.”
The protest also captured the attention of tourists in Harvard Yard, including 26-year-old Gabriela Junqueira from Brazil.
“We don’t really think of Harvard as a place where protests would occur,” Junqueira said. “We think of Harvard as sort of perfect and as a place where protests wouldn’t occur because that doesn’t need to happen. We’re surprised.”
Around 3 p.m., protesters began marching toward Emerson Hall across Tercentenary Theatre, where University president Lawrence S. Bacow was scheduled to lead a faculty meeting.
Ethnic Studies demonstrators holding their own protest at the meeting merged with HGSU when they reached Emerson.
Several protesters attempted to hold their picket signs up to the windows of the faculty meeting.
Hours later, the strike concluded with demonstrators gathering outside Emerson to chant as Bacow and other faculty members left the meeting.
Bacow ultimately left the faculty meeting just after 5:30 p.m. in a waiting car.
As Bacow’s car sped away, demonstrators chanted “Shame! Shame!” before returning to PBHA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What’s it like coming from a family of super athletes?
Both junior Lane Leschly and sophomore Bo Leschly play varsity tennis at Harvard. Their grandfather, Jan Leschly, played professionally for Denmark. Their father, Mark Leschly ’90, also played for the Crimson. Their uncles Jake, Stig, and Nick all played tennis at Princeton. Their cousin, Kayla ’23, plays tennis at Harvard as well, while her twin sister Jayme plays at Princeton.
With so much tennis experience in their family, it was only natural for Lane and Bo to play the sport.
The Leschlys grew up in Atherton, California. Lane, the older brother, began playing tennis at the age of five and immediately fell in love with the sport. He acknowledges that his family’s tennis background “could be perceived as a lot of pressure,” but overall feels that “it was an unreal and amazing environment to grow up in. [It was] a great opportunity to develop as a tennis player.”
As a young player, Lane loved training with his family and receiving coaching advice from them. His father’s success inspired him to make ambitious goals for the future.
“There’s always the dream to play at college, and I always wanted to play at Harvard when I was younger,” Lane recalled.
When he was 10, Lane would show up at tennis practices at Stanford wearing Harvard gear. He laughingly mentions his youth coach making fun of him for wearing his father’s old Crimson vest. Today, he emphasizes the importance of taking a step back and appreciating one’s accomplishments.
“We always get so psyched up about what the next goal is that we never really take time to step back and appreciate what we have accomplished,” Lane observed. “It’s unbelievable thinking, wow, that was my childhood dream.”
Bo also started playing tennis at a young age, and his brother’s love for the sport inspired him.
“We grew up playing together,” Bo recalled. “There’s that [age] gap, obviously growing up he was a little bit better. He pushed me.”
The Leschly brothers attended Menlo High School. Despite their age difference, the two played on the same high school team and sometimes competed together in local tournaments. Both excelled at tennis. Lane was recognized as a high school All-American in 2015 and played in the Australian Open Juniors qualifications round in doubles in 2016. During his high school career, his team won three consecutive WBAL, CSS, and NorCal Championships. Bo also played on the 2015 team, and his team won the CSS and NorCal titles again in 2018. He was named to the National High School All-American Team Invitational All-Tournament team in 2018 after leaving his high school to an undefeated season.
After successful high school careers, collegiate tennis was a natural next step for both Lane and Bo.
“[Playing in college] wasn’t the goal per se growing up,” Bo said. “[But] it was definitely more the goal coming in towards middle school and then high school.”
When asked whether Lane playing for the Crimson affected Bo’s decision to commit, the younger Leschly responded simply, “yeah.” Having a sibling who plays the same Division I collegiate sport is incredibly rare, and being able to play on the same team with them is an even more unique experience.
“Having him on the team, getting to play with him, and having that bond [of] being family [and also] being teammates is something very special,” Bo stated.
Lane feels similarly. “Having [my] brother there makes it another level of fun,” he said.
Tennis is often a pretty individual sport, and both Bo and Lane emphasize how the incredible team dynamics enhance the game.
“In college when you actually play on a team, it’s very, very different [from high school] and very rewarding because normally when you’re playing tennis, you’re all alone,” Bo explained. “Having a team there to help you in college is inspiring and keeps you moving forward.”
Being on the same team helps keep the Leschlys connected.
“I see [Lane] every day,” Bo said, “which is something that’s great to have especially when I’m at college and, you know, you don’t see family that much.”
Cambridge is a long way from California, and having family close by makes it easier to stay connected.
Lane added, “Being on the Harvard team with him is a great opportunity to make sure that we stay in touch as siblings. I get to see him every day which I’m so grateful for.”
Lane also acknowledges that, in addition to being at the same school, being on the same team makes it easier for the brothers to see each other. College students often have hectic schedules, and many of Lane’s friends have to set dates just to see each other every week. Luckily, Lane and Bo don’t have to worry about setting specific times to see each other.
“Having [seeing Bo] as part of my daily schedule, it’s great,” Lane said. “I’m really appreciative of it.”
“We’ve had a lot of good times together on the court,” Bo summarized.
With two more seasons until Lane graduates, the Leschly brothers will have even more opportunities for success together on the tennis team.
The Crimson will begin their spring season on January 19th with matches against Purdue and Army. Its home opener will be against BYU on January 24th.

BOSTON — After opening the 2019-2020 campaign with the longest winning streak in program history, the No. 12/9 Harvard men’s hockey team saw its first losing streak of the season begin on Tuesday night. The Crimson (6-2-0, 6-0-0 ECAC) suffered a 5-2 defeat at the hands of Boston University (5-6-5, 3-3-4 HEA), struggling to establish the dominance that defined its first six games of the season.
“Guys played well from the start of the game to the end of the game,” BU coach Albie O’Connell said. “We forechecked them really well…. That team [Harvard] can really skate, and I thought we did a good job of taking away some time and space from them.”
Taking a one-score advantage into the first intermission, the Terriers carried play and extended their lead in the middle period. Late in the frame, the referees signaled a delayed penalty call on junior defenseman Reilly Walsh for roughing; Walsh raised his arms as he hit a BU skater near center ice.
With the extra attacker on the ice, the Terriers pinned the Crimson in its defensive zone. The long attacking shift culminated in captain Patrick Curry ripping a one-timer past Harvard goaltender Cameron Gornet (4 GA, .875 SV%). Junior blue-liner David Farrance, who nabbed a pair of assists in Tuesday’s outing, served up the clapper with a savvy cross-ice feed. Curry’s foray into double-digit goal scoring on the year gave his team a multi-point lead at the period horn — one which it was able to defend in the ensuing third stanza.
Five minutes into the final frame, BU defenseman Cam Crotty bulged the twine with a slapshot from the right circle, stretching the home team’s edge to three. The snipe put the game out of reach for the visiting Crimson, as Harvard’s late-third-period powerplay goal, courtesy of sophomore Jack Drury, made only a dent in the deficit.
Terriers backstop Sam Tucker (2 GA, .920 SV%), familiar with the Crimson from his days at Ivy League rival Yale, put forth one of his better performances on the season. In particular, he made several saves in the bout’s late stages to preserve his squad’s comfortable lead. Harvard attacked with significant momentum after Drury’s tuck and perhaps would have narrowed the margin to one without Tucker’s stout play. BU hung on, however, and potted an empty-net goal with just over a minute remaining to seal the victory.
“We ended up taking a penalty and they scored a goal,” coach O’Connell said. “[Tucker] made a huge save. It could have gone 4-3 very easily, [but] he made a highlight-reel save on a one-timer to keep the game, and then we ended up getting another one.”
The high-octane Crimson, which arrived at Agganis Arena as the number-one scoring team in the country (5.00 goals per game), failed to string together long spurts of crisp passing, threatening chances, and overall offensive dominance in Tuesday’s affair. The ice was tilted in the Terriers favor especially in the first two periods.
“The first two goals, they didn’t really have to work very hard for,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The first 10 minutes of the game were pretty sloppy, and teams were trading chances. I also think that we took a couple of penalties that were unnecessary and didn’t allow us to get to our game. I really didn’t feel like we started to skate until the third period.”
Tuesday’s contest saw three goals before the halfway point of the first period, the most action-packed segment of the game. Freshman forward Trevor Zegras opened the scoring less than 90 seconds into the tilt, burying an in-alone chance on Gornet. Senior Patrick Harper forced a turnover in the Crimson’s zone, leading to the top-shelf finish from the Anaheim Ducks first-round selection. Harper finished with a game-high three points.
Prior to Zegras’ fifth of the season, BU had not scored since Nov. 23, as the team suffered shutout defeats to Sacred Heart and Cornell on either side of the Thanksgiving holiday.
The lousy start continued for the visitors when sophomore forward Baker Shore took a hooking penalty on the shift following the Terriers’ opening strike. Already ahead, 1-0, BU embarked on an early powerplay opportunity. Fortune quickly reversed for Harvard, however, as the penalty-killing unit raced up the ice and found twine on the rush.
Captain Nathan Krusko connected on a give-and-go with Walsh, who beat Tucker under the pads. Walsh’s tally erased his squad’s stumble out of the gate, but the ledger did not remain even for long. At the 12:30 mark of the frame, freshman forward Ethan Phillips toe-dragged around Walsh and threw a puck toward the goal which redirected in off fellow rookie Robert Mastrosimone. The hosts took the 2-1 advantage into the first intermission.
“In road games, you want to get on a team early,” Krusko said. “You want to take the energy away from the building. I felt like we didn’t do it good enough tonight. It felt like we were in and out. A lot of the lines couldn’t sustain any offense…. It just took too long for us to get to our game.”
Tuesday’s loss marks Harvard’s second straight and another blown opportunity in the past week to pocket a victory over a prestigious Boston hockey school. The team’s non-conference games have significant bearing on the Pairwise rankings, so in this regard the defeat will go down as a disappointment.
“Regardless of teams’ rankings and teams’ conferences, every night is a battle in this league,” Krusko said. “You have to come out every night playing like they’re the number-one team in the country. In terms of the national conversation, obviously we feel strongly with the group we have. We have to take care of business with our out-of-conference games. We don’t get many of them, so that kind of increases the pressure on every single game.”
Additionally, the Crimson’s early-December schedule — including clashes with Boston College, BU, and Cornell — provided a crucial chance for the group to validate its position among the NCAA’s elite teams. Still winless after two of these matchups, Harvard will turn to the No. 2 Big Red on Friday in an attempt to reaffirm its lofty national ranking and place in the national college hockey conversation.
“We felt like we established who we wanted to be early, winning a lot of games” Krusko said. “These past two games kind of gave us a shock and gave us a reminder that maybe we’re not as good as we think we are [yet]…. It’s really fortunate that we have such a great team coming into our building Friday because it gives us an opportunity to reestablish our identity and let everyone know that starting 6-0 wasn’t a fluke.”

Have you ever seen a cat on a leash? If not, you probably haven’t met Moose and Fox, the two newest animal residents of Pfoho. Moose, a two-year-old ragdoll cat, and Fox, an about six-month-old domestic longhair, belong to Jennifer Kunes ’19, a House Elf (a recent graduate who contributes to house events and community) in Pfoho. Moose and Fox got their names because Kunes is a “big fan of naming animals the names of other animals.”
Kunes adopted Moose on the Fourth of July. This stud is a Ragdoll cat (pretty fancy, as far as cats go), but his breeder wasn’t a fan of the offspring he was producing, so Kunes got him for free! Fox, on the other hand, is from a shelter in Rhode Island.
Kunes never saw herself as a cat person; “I grew up with really big dogs… my family dog is a black lab.” However, a cat seemed like the perfect pet to fit her sometimes unpredictable schedule, and Kunes noted, “I still do walk [the cats] but you don’t have to walk them twice a day… they’re way more self sufficient [than dogs].”
So how did Kunes end up with not one, but two cats? She just wanted Moose to be happy, noting that “after the first month I realized that... [Moose] seemed very bored and I felt bad leaving him when I had to go to work.” Looking to spice up Moose’s everyday life, Kunes talked to her vet, who suggested that Kunes add a kitten to the family. As soon as Fox arrived, the two cats took to each other almost immediately, and, according to Kunes, “Moose straight up acts like he’s Fox’s father.” During this interview, Fox was tearing around Comstock common room, knocking over lamps and scrambling up the furniture. Moose followed, keeping an eye on his young charge, while also ensuring he made his rounds back to Kunes for treats.
Not only do these cats walk on leash, but Moose also does tricks. He knows how to sit, lay down, and even stand on his hind legs to grab a treat. Kunes has high hopes for training Moose, explaining, “I want to teach Moose to balance a treat on his nose.” As for Fox, well, “Fox… can’t really do anything,” admitted Kunes.
While Moose is a morning cuddler, he has another way he likes to start the day. “Moose has a huge thing for my hair. He really likes to eat my hair, so if I go to sleep with my hair down, I’ll wake up in the morning to him consuming my hair”, explained Kunes. Fox, on the other hand, is “the problem child.” Kunes said she understands when “parents are like this one, this is the troublemaker.” Fox enjoys unravelling entire rolls of toilet paper across Kunes’s room and then shredding it. He also enjoys eating psets. Yes, you read that right. With Kunes as a TF, “my cat ate your homework” could be the very real reason you’re not getting your pset back. “There are definitive claw marks on some people’s homework when I hand it back,'' laughed Kunes.
Although she’s only had the cats for a few months, Kunes said her favorite memory of the two of them was when Moose noticed Fox was having trouble grooming himself, and “took him under his wing and showed [Fox] how to groom himself.” After a while, Fox caught on, and after dinner he’d watch Moose and “they’d sit side by side cleaning their faces.”
When asked what the cats would study as Harvard students, Kunes considered the pair, then said: “Moose would be like Philosophy. I feel like Moose is dignified like that. What would Fox be? Folk-Myth? Is that offensive to Folk-Myth people?”
Ultimately, Kunes wants people to know that her cats “are just so cute” and that having cats has significantly changed her lifestyle. Having cats forces her to “establish boundaries for myself in terms of how much time I’m spending at home, which I don’t usually do for myself, but I think is healthy.” For example, with the cats, she said she “can’t just stay out until midnight and not come home because then they’ll miss dinner.”
Moose and Fox are pretty social cats, so Kunes holds cat office hours by appointment. If you need some kitten time, all three of them would love for you to stop by.

Few can say they’ve spent most of their life at Harvard. Boris the Cat, however, is one of them. Boris Vanderbilt Threlkeld has been a resident of Adams House with his owner Aubry Threlkeld for more than nine years — and for a cat that is now just 10 years old, this is quite an accomplishment.
Threlkeld first began searching for a furry friend of his own when he moved to Adams as a new tutor. “My roommate prior to moving here had cats, and I really liked having them around,” he said. Threlkeld headed to the Animal Rescue League of Boston with the goal of getting a kitten. However, it was there that he met Boris, a “17-pound, long-haired Maine Coon” who climbed right into his lap the first day he met him, and the rest is history.
While Threlkeld admittedly planned to come up with a more creative name for his new companion, the shelter had given him the name Boris and it just stuck. “I said, ‘You look like a Boris, I’m gonna have to keep you named Boris!’”
A true Adams cat, Boris gained his middle name from his time living in the Vanderbilt Suite in Westmorely. And despite being “really afraid of the outside,” he’s done a fair amount of exploring while students are away, even making it all the way to the Adams House library during J-Term one year.
While Boris has never been a big fan of large groups, he still enjoys being an “ambassador” of sorts when any students come to visit. “He’ll come out and want to meet everybody, especially if they’re quiet, but then he wants to go back to his own life,” explained Threlkeld. And while Boris no longer holds office hours like he did during his first few years in Adams, he’s still in high demand from students eager for a chance to babysit or even just feed him.
If Threlkeld were to describe Boris in one word, it would undoubtedly be “food-motivated.” One of Threlkeld’s favorite memories of Boris is from when they were in his first room in Adams. “I wasn’t really used to having cats around, so I put a big bag of dry food at the top of a set of shelves,” remembers Threlkeld. “I heard a crash at like 3 a.m. — he had climbed all the way to the very top of the shelves and knocked over the whole bag of dried food!” He’s also not afraid to wake up everyone else in the area to make sure he gets his breakfast early in the morning, earning him the nickname of the “kitty alarm clock.”
For Threlkeld, one of the best parts of adopting Boris was learning more about the Animal Rescue League of Boston where he rescued him from. “They had a very good strong sense of the cats and try to match you really well to a pet,” Threlkeld said. “I think if people are ever looking to adopt, it’s so important to adopt a rescue!”
More than anything, Threlkeld has loved having a cat around campus and has even been considering adopting another kitten. For the time being, though, Boris enjoys being in the spotlight — this will actually be his second time in The Crimson, after being photographed for the holiday season nearly seven years ago

According to Leverett House tutor and Oshie’s owner, John L. Pulice ’15, Leverett students are “big fans” of the new corgi in the house. Of course, a “corgi puppy is a strong attraction” in any house community, but especially in Leverett, where the corgis of the Georgi’s (former Faculty Deans Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi) were unofficial mascots.
Pulice says students have asked if Oshie is “the replacement corgi.” Not intentionally, Pulice said, but he was very recently welcomed to Leverett House. Pulice got Oshie, who traveled all the way from Missouri by car to get to Cambridge, last spring when Oshie was nine weeks old. Oshie is fully grown now, weighing in at around 20 pounds, but at 10 months old, he is still a puppy.
Pulice, who grew up with a golden retriever, didn’t set out to get a corgi, but for the size of a tutor suite and a Ph.D. student lifestyle, Oshie was “the right size and the right temperament.”
On how Oshie got his adorable name, Pulice confirmed that Oshie is an homage to the Washington Capitals player T.J. Oshie. Pulice is from the D.C. Metro area, and identifies as “a really big Capitals fan,” so Oshie seemed like the perfect reference to a favorite Caps player, especially after the team’s 2018 Stanley Cup win. Plus, “‘Oshie the corgi’ kind of rolls off the tongue.”
Oshie’s favorite spot on campus is probably the fenced-in Leverett courtyard, which is essentially his backyard. There he enjoys playing with other students and Leverett house dogs, like Kepler the black lab. According to Pulice, Oshie is well-behaved and well-trained … now. He used to have a “very bad understanding of the fact that the hallway was still inside. He would get right to the door of my suite and then he’d start pooping in front of the door. He was like ‘It’s still outside!’ and I was like ‘No it’s not.’” He hasn’t had accidents in a while though,” Pulice said. We’re so proud of Oshie’s progress!
Oshie is a tri-corgi, which means that beyond being triply cute, he has red, white, and black coloring. If you need any help spotting him on campus, look for a signature white spot on his brow. “It’s his little unique signifier,” says Pulice.
If you’re lamenting the fact that you have yet to get quality time with Oshie, fear not: Pulice runs the Leverett House website, and says an online sign-up for time with Oshie is in the works. “The plan is to have a walking schedule.” So stay tuned Lev students! The rest of us are certainly a bit jealous of your new corgi mascot.
