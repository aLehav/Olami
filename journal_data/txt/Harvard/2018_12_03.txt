After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Edith E. Scott Saavedra ’80 has recently released a bilingual historical novel entitled “The Lamps of Albarracín/Los candiles de Albarracín.” Through a fictionalized, first-person narrative, the novel illustrates the multicultural complexity of medieval Aragón during the years of the Spanish Inquisition. The author paints a compelling picture of a town thrust into crisis, where Jews, Christians and Muslims living side by side find themselves in the midst of a perilous political shift that would change their lives forever.  Scott, who, in the Spanish tradition, is also using her mother’s Sephardic surname Saavedra for purposes of the novel, sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss her book and her time at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: How did your research in writing this novel connect you with your ancestry or background?
Edith Scott Saavedra: I only discovered that my mother's clan had been Sephardim about seven years ago, and I had started on a search to understand the origins of her family back when I was an undergraduate at Harvard, because as I was growing up in Washington, D.C. in the 1970s, my mother raised me in a traditional way. She came from rural Central America, and she taught me precepts, rules, sayings that didn't mesh to anything I knew. I found out now in retrospect that they were preserved from 15th century Sephardic tradition and the Talmud.
THC: When you first started doing this research, did you know that you wanted to write a historical novel?
ESS: The truth is I had no idea. I had no thought to write a historical novel. About seven years ago I began to research, on my handphone, on the internet, at night. Maybe research is too cold a word… I had a thirst to understand, to take in this incredible period of Western history, this time and place. So I just began searching and searching and pulling up wonderful material on the internet, original documents from medieval Aragón, original artwork which had been pulled together by groups which are now organizing to preserve and communicate the culture of medieval Aragon. And the more I saw images, the more I saw artwork, the more I saw handicrafts, ceramics, poetry, the more fascinated and drawn in I became. I did this for several years, and then suddenly one fall five years ago I began to write a novel.
THC: How did Harvard shape your career path, as well as your work as a writer?
ESS: At Harvard I had two competing interests. One of them was very much Social Studies. The other was literature, and so I took several courses in Spanish literature, including the seminal famous HUM 55, which was taught at the time by Juan Marichal… I decided to concentrate in Social Studies, because I had a desire to understand — it sounds maybe naive now — but I wanted to have a framework in which I could understand how the world worked, in particular the political social world that we live in, the government, laws, etc… And both of these strands came together to enable me to write my novel, because I basically pulled up my sleeves and cut through received wisdom to understand what was really happening at that time and place.
THC: What role do you think that creative historical fiction as you've created this novel, plays in the larger historical narrative?
ESS: I think it plays a major role. We've all heard the adage, “there's no history, history is constantly rewriting itself.” But in instances where there is a totalitarian authoritarian regime that has completely controlled the recording of history and the historical story that has been handed down, I feel it is morally incumbent on us who have the tools, who have the perspective, who have the access to international research and creative minds, who can think outside the box, it is incumbent on us to go back and recreate the experiences of the people who were oppressed. Because their stories have been erased. The Jews were expelled from Spain, the expulsion occurred within six years of that conflict. How could these people maintain any record of what happened to them?
THC: You studied civil rights at Harvard with Robert Coles. Do you see any comparisons between what happened in Spain under the Inquisition and periods of oppression in this country?
ESS: It's very difficult, and perhaps perilous, to try to draw summary comparisons between periods of history. I think what I'll do with this question is jump forward to the present day. Because definitely, Robert Coles has shaped the way I think, in the sense that I took his seminar as a sophomore. I think that in the Western world today… increasingly, we're thinking of people divided into groups. Increasingly, we're saying that something is not true where the statement is in itself repugnant and shouldn't need to be even thought. And I fear that for all of us, this imposes a burden and a danger that we all will increasingly focus on this discourse of disunity and not think about our common humanity, and our common polity… We might think, oh well, of course, we're not experiencing anything like that.
Well, pause. If we are dragged and led far enough along this road, our discourse can fundamentally disintegrate, our way of thinking, and our souls. So in order to combat this, again, every day, how do we think, how do we act, and if we are so inclined, religiously, how do we pray?
THC: You've released your novel concurrently in English and Spanish. What audiences do you hope to reach by putting forth a bilingual work?
ESS: Spain has never come to a national agreement or consensus over Franco, much less the Inquisition. And I have been told several times that nothing was wrong because everybody knows that only three people ever died in the history of the Inquisition. Now, we may smile at this, but I am being told it repeatedly. But I also sent out about 8,000 Linkedin messages to people in Spain and Portugal, and I received 1,500 messages of support… They cherish their multicultural heritage, and it's time for the story of these different peoples to be told. So I believe that this book should be very much a book that belongs to Spanish speaking readers, and not a translation of an English work that comes out later, but a book that's created in two languages, which is how I went about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Grant Morrison’s 1989 graphic novel “Batman Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the psychotherapist Ruth Adams muses on the Joker: “It’s quite possible we may actually be looking at some kind of super-sanity here.” Later in the story, Dr. Arkham, founder of the Arkham Asylum, devours his wife and daughter after their brutal murder at the hands of an escaped asylum patient. He thinks to himself: “It all seems perfectly rational. Perfectly, perfectly rational.”
Morrison published “Serious House” because he wanted to kill Batman. Specifically, he wanted to kill the then-latest incarnation of the character, popularized by Frank Miller in the mid-1980s. Miller wrote Batman as a grizzled, violent, Freudian Vietnam vet, an iron-fisted punisher and pummeler of black and brown drug dealers and trannie hookers, the vengeful soul of ’80s white America, the defender of order and sanity in a cataclysmic age.
This was the Batman Morrison wanted to kill. And to do so, he let loose the Devil itself: that agent of chaos, the Joker.
The first time Joker’s face appears in the graphic novel is upon Batman’s arrival at Arkham Asylum, where the collection of super-criminals and psychopaths imprisoned there have gotten loose. The Joker’s eyes are framed by red done up in a sweeping cat-eye; Their lips are stained with bloody lipstick, their face powdered a dainty bone-white. They cry: “Aren’t I just good enough to eat?” At one point, they give Batman’s ass a tight squeeze, calling him “honey pie” and “dear.” When Harvey Dent pisses on the floor, they screech “You trying to ruin my heels?” At another point, they grab one of their male hostages tight and begs “Kiss me, Charlie! Ravish me!”
It wasn’t until I read Morrison’s notes on his original script that my sneaky sense of déjà vu, of recognition of — God, dare I say it — kinship began to make sense. In Morrison’s original script, the Joker was dressed “as ‘Madonna,’ in a black basque, seamed tights and lace-up stiletto boots.” Morrison writes that “he should look simply grotesque,” but that somehow, dressed to the nines in drag, the Joker possesses “a bizarre kind of attractiveness and sexuality.”
In other words, Morrison’s Joker is a trans woman.
This trans Joker wants to kill the image of Batman that Frank Miller created. Or, rather, in their words to Batman:
“We want you. In here. With us. In the madhouse. Where you belong.”
The Joker wants Batman to admit that sanity, the ironclad justice Frank Miller built him to crave, is an illusion. Morrison frames the struggle between Batman and the Joker with the story of Dr. Arkham. Arkham opens the asylum to conquer irrationality, aberration, psychic abnormality, to assert the calm and cleansing light of rational thought and male European wisdom into the dark maternal crevices of the insane mind. But in the end, he collapses in the bloody remnants of the Old World Order, locked up in his own asylum. In the end, sanity comes crashing down.
In “Madness and Civilization," Michel Foucault argues that the modern notion of mental “illness,” mental “not-rightness,” is not objective medical science. It can be used as a concept and tool for those in power to oppress, a corrective principle of condemnation for those who do not fit society’s schemas. In this form, it is deeply connected to the creation of marginalizing categories. Transness was once a mental disorder. Dysmorphia was a sign of mental unhealth, not to be met on its own terms, reckoned with, and adapted to, but to be erased, fixed, corrected. Blackness was considered a morphological and biological disorder with mental consequences (such as those elucidated by Frantz Fanon).  “Hysteria” as a diagnosable mental disorder was created to pathologize womanhood. And LGBTQ+ conversion camps manufacture queerness as a state of mind to be corrected. In these cases, mental unhealth is constructed to be a placeholder for, an admonishment of, social abnormality.
Ruth Adams links “super sanity” to a lack of “control over the sensory information [received] from the outside world.” The Joker is left with a “chaotic” flow of pure input, detached from schemas, orders, and structures that orient, categorize, and command — structures like gender. This might be understood as insanity, but Adams wonders: Could this not be its own kind of profane hyper-clarity? Could the Joker’s insane gender-play not be its own wild, dangerous, ferocious rejection of the colonizing, oppressive forces of the institution, the asylum, the Man?
The Joker wants to kill Batman. They want him to admit, as he finally does, “It’s only madness that makes us what we are.” Reading his final admittance of his own insanity, I saw Batman transformed, murdered and reborn: no longer a bastion of the hyper-anxious New Right; no longer a plague on Black folks just trying to get by; no longer a defender of the high and the beautiful and the white and the light. I saw Batman become, like the Joker, a symbol of the tectonic disruption of all that we are told is good and holy.
I saw hope, hope that even the most rigid and demonic notions — the vigilante, or the mad(man), or the villain — could be resuscitated. And in this project of resuscitation lies the power of low art. Just as the stale and hyper-rationality of Batman could be transformed into a subversive paean to the power of transness, so too can pleasure, ugliness, and minstrelsy be transformed into vehicles of liberation. In Morrison’s Batman, I saw hope that the forces of hegemony and order and the gaze of the White Man could be escaped, and a world built beyond their grasp.
In the end, the Joker bids adieu to a now “cured” Batman, ready to embrace the War on Crime with a new, decidedly kinky, irrational, and subversive tilt. They wave at his receding back as he strides away from the madhouse, and they crow:
“Enjoy yourself out there. In the Asylum.”
Down with the laws of taste and beauty! Down with any demand to be anything! Down with good art! Down with hegemonic forces of whiteness and gender and class! Down with sanity! Down with the madhouse! Down with the creation of concepts, the institutionalization of intelligibility, the demonization of all that is different!
Up, in Miss Joker’s words, with the real world!
—Contributing writer Nicholas P. Whittaker’s column, "Low End Theory,” digs deep into the archive of bad, taboo, and ugly art, seeking political liberation in the low.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William Faulkner theorized that every novelist is a failed short story writer, and every short story writer is a failed poet. Similarly, in the words of a respected historian, most books should be journal articles, and most journal articles should be footnotes. You get the point: Most columns should be tweets.
Indeed, for this column, which I’ve been writing off and on since Sept. 2016, I’ve found that the sub-headline usually captures 90 percent of an article’s point. The 1,000-odd words that follow dress it up in examples and statistics, wasting your time, dear reader, and mine. With so many topics to talk about at Harvard and beyond, why should we bother? If Michel de Montaigne could write one 60-page essay about death, doctors, defecating, and seemingly any other topic that occurred to him, extensively quoting classical writers and rarely bothering to segue, why can’t my own column be a series of loosely connected hot takes until I run out of space? Montaigne couldn’t even use hyperlinks. So let’s get started.
Like nearly every other school, Harvard should let students at least rank their housing preferences. Some people want to be in the Quad, and many don’t. Mather House should house people who prioritize singles over classical architecture and proximity to the Yard, and vice versa for Adams House.
Speaking of architecture, as Matthew B. McDole, Kennedy School alum, wrote in these pages, the Yard’s Georgian style is both aesthetically and morally superior to the imposing, ostentatious, and pretentious brick wall of Eliot, Winthrop, Leverett, and Dunster Houses that faces the Charles. Whether or not you buy into the justifications of brutalism as anti-bourgeois or even heroic, you have to admit that Mather and Gund Hall look more interesting than those derivative posers. Vive le béton brut!
Harvard should recognize its role in the process of letting powerful people get away with horrible things. By giving fellowships to Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski, for example, the Institute of Politics set a precedent that people who aided and abetted the Trump administration’s horrors will be received warmly in polite (even liberal) society. Oh, and they keep inviting Henry A. Kissinger ’50 to speak. Bad.
Harvard should abolish General Education and foreign language requirements. They mostly serve to add headaches and complexity to the process of choosing classes, which should be driven by actual intellectual interests or practical concerns. The evidence that students in general remember very little content from their classes makes this a slam dunk. Get real: Few forced to take French 10 and 11 will speak a useful amount of the language even a few months after the final, and even fewer of the hundreds who skate through Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory” become better citizens through that process. (How many go straight to Goldman Sachs afterwards, or vote Republican?)
We should adopt Stanford’s “open-door policy” for alcohol. It’s absurd to think that banning alcohol from the Yard will stop freshmen from drinking rather than making their habits more irregular and dangerous.
Harvard undergrads (and the rest of the world) should resist the temptation to think of the College’s admissions process as a judgment on our worth as an 18-year-old. Instead, consider it as a pairing of the school’s resources with specific people who then use them for four-plus years.
Relatedly, as Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker wrote in a 2014 article in The New Republic, Harvard should refocus admissions away from extracurriculars and intangibles and toward academic potential, mostly measured by test scores and grades (even if I would not have gotten in under this regime). It is irresponsible that the institution with the greatest capacity for research — endless library stacks and lab space, world-renowned faculty in every office — gives so many of its undergraduate seats on the basis of who can best ski down a mountain, play the bassoon, or navigate high school student body politics. As Pinker says, why couldn’t future presidents or business leaders go to Amherst or Swarthmore Colleges? Let’s get these Nobels! It’s what we’re best at.
A corollary: Downsize athletics. Harvard has more Division I sports programs than any other American college, and when these programs recruit, they take seats from non-athletes with better qualifications otherwise. (If this weren’t the case, we wouldn’t need to recruit them!) We should first cut the programs that most stack the deck for prep school kids (sailing, skiing, crew) and the ones that oft-injure their players (football).
Finally, despite the successful use of expanding tomato basil ravioli soup availability as a Undergraduate Council presidential campaign issue, the best Harvard University Dining Services food is clam chowder. What candidate will embrace this, the most important cause I have mentioned? The whole world is watching.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American Economic Association recently appointed Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. to a prestigious administrative position. Harvard has barred Fryer from entering his lab since March after allegations of sexual and gender-based harassment. Days following the AEA's announcement, the association released a statement saying it had learned one of its officers — almost certainly Fryer — is currently facing accusations of “creating a hostile work environment."
Given The Crimson and other media outlets such as the Boston Globe reported on the accusations leveled against Fryer, we are surprised and frankly disappointed that the AEA appointed Fryer as one of its officers. The decision demonstrates a general lack of due diligence in the association's selection process.
This past April, the AEA adopted a new code of professional conduct that emphasizes inclusion, equity, and workplace safety. The policies seek to provide equal opportunity to economists of all backgrounds. The alleged harassment committed by Fryer is antithetical to precisely these values, as — should it be found true — the alleged conduct jeopardized the comfort, safety, and free expression of other professionals and students in the field.
As we await the results of Harvard’s internal investigation of Fryer’s alleged actions, this incident points to serious problems with the AEA’s officer selection process.
The association’s claim that it became aware of the allegations only after appointing him is deeply disappointing. It would seem difficult to miss the news, given the degree to which the allegations permeated the media at the time. A simple Google search would have sufficed. Going forward, we urge the AEA to seriously reconsider how it vets potential officers. In order to uphold the organization's own ethical standards, the association must actively study whether its potential appointees have any history of workplace misconduct, especially that which jeopardizes the safety of others based on gender and other identifiers.
Pending Harvard's investigation, the association's subsequent actions will reflect the degree of its genuine commitment to the professional code of ethics it adopted in the spring. The AEA’s stated promise to foster “a professional environment with equal opportunity and fair treatment for all economists” would seem to necessarily contradict the decision to appoint someone currently under investigation for sexual misconduct.
It now falls on Harvard to release the results of its investigations quickly. The relative efficiency of the investigations thus far has been admirable — at least one of which has been completed though not released. Any final decision on whether or not punitive measures should be taken must be made swiftly and judiciously.
The University’s promptness in doing so is critical to the AEA’s ability to make a choice regarding its appointment of Fryer. Moreover, its decision is vital to the University’s own ability to move forward in its economic and educational work. Fryer’s lab, with or without him, does important economic research and offers economic opportunities to Harvard students. The sooner the University releases the results of its investigation, the sooner the University can try to institute some normalcy around the lab and its Economics Department more broadly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As The Crimson has reported, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has repeatedly failed to support BGLTQ graduate students at GSAS. As the co-president of LGBTQ@GSAS, I saw these issues firsthand.
We — the student group serving BGLTQ students at GSAS — were one of the only resources for BGLTQ graduate students at Harvard. Frequently, students from across Harvard’s schools came to me to ask who in the administration they could turn to for support, how to access BGLTQ-informed medical care, where international students could go to address their concerns, and more. Each time, I had to break it to them: Harvard lacks anywhere to go for help. There is no dedicated staff person with the title and training to assist graduate students with BGLTQ issues.
Harvard’s peer institutions, including MIT, Brown, Princeton, and Yale, all have BGLTQ centers open to all of their students — as well as to faculty and university employees — paid staff that plan regular events, and graduate student-specific resources. In addition, many of these universities make concerted efforts to provide students with BGLTQ-informed healthcare.
Harvard’s graduate students have no such center open to them and no dedicated staff person who works with BGLTQ issues, and, from what I understand, students’ experiences with Harvard University Health Services providers are hit or miss. The College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life serves College students, and its undergraduate-focused resources are neither intended for nor suitable for graduate students. Harvard Medical School has a staff person who serves its BGLTQ faculty and students. And that, to my knowledge, is it.
In my time as co-president of LGBTQ@GSAS, I was contacted by many prospective students asking whether they should attend Harvard. They were curious whether Harvard is welcoming to BGLTQ students and if it is the right school for them. However, unfortunately, I had to tell them the truth. If being BGLTQ is central to who you are, you would be better off at another institution because Harvard offers few resources. I told them that any community they did find here would be small and embattled, held together by unpaid student volunteers trying to create what they could — often to the detriment of their own academic work. It was heartbreaking every time I had to tell a student that they might be better off somewhere else.
Yes, GSAS administrators worked with LGBTQ@GSAS to create a “You Are Welcome Here” sticker campaign a few years ago. But two years later, many of us are still left wondering, are we actually welcome here? A sticker is not a safe space nor is it a resource center. A sticker cannot train staff and faculty to be more BGLTQ-informed, and it cannot intervene in advisor-advisee conflicts. A sticker certainly can’t direct students to appropriate medical and mental health resources or create professionalization programming that addresses the concerns of BGLTQ academics.
Harvard needs to make a tangible demonstration that it wants all of us here. It is not enough to speak about BGLTQ inclusion, update our symbols, and create a nondiscrimination policy. Harvard must commit to its BGLTQ students by hiring staff, creating a center, and designing programming specifically for the BGLTQ community. The University must track the number of BGLTQ students who are at Harvard and address the specific needs of our community.
Harvard is once again facing decisions about whether to give resources to these groups that it has previously ignored. As a member of the bargaining committee, I know that the Harvard Graduate Student Union has put forward proposals to make contractual commitments that would advance equality by creating substantive resources for all BGLTQ student workers. The Dudley House faculty deans are stepping aside, and a new GSAS student resources office is on its way. Hopefully GSAS dean Emma Dench will include resources for BGLTQ students in this center, including paid staff members trained to help BGLTQ students. I urge Harvard to take this opportunity to correct course and serve all of its diverse students by providing us with what we need to succeed.
Displays of good intentions are not enough. Harvard must show that the scholarship of all of its students, whether they are queer, non-white, low-income, undocumented, or international, is central to the success of this great institution. Harvard needs to stand up for all of us.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on a proposal Tuesday to add two class start times to the new academic schedule rolled out at the beginning of the fall semester.
The Faculty previously discussed the potential change at its last meeting in November when FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke presented a proposal to add these class times so students would have more time to eat lunch. If approved, faculty members could officially offer classes beginning at 12:45 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. in addition to the current slate of options.
In October, Harvard University Dining Services extended dining hall hours by 30 minutes to accommodate the new academic schedule as many seminars are scheduled to meet from 12 p.m.to 2:45 pm, overlapping entirely with the lunch hours in the undergraduate dining halls. The 12 upperclassmen residential Houses and Annenberg Hall, the freshman dining hall, now open at 11:30 a.m. instead of 12 noon.
In addition to the schedule proposal, David L. Howell, professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, will present a report on behalf of a committee of the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest governing body. In November 2015, the Faculty voted to amend the council’s election procedures with the requirement that FAS form a committee to review the electoral changes after three years. Howell, who serves as chair of the review committee and is a member of the council, will present the group’s findings at the Faculty meeting.
Previously, council elections required voters to rank their preferences among a large number of candidates, and the votes were subsequently counted in rounds. The system was deemed “confusing” and “unnecessarily complicated,” according to an April 2015 report. After the release of the report criticizing the old system, the Faculty adopted a new voting system for the council.
The changes have been successful and have led to more nominations and higher voter turnout among Faculty members, according to the report.
“The aim of the reform was to simplify the election procedures (and thereby boost voter turnout) while encouraging a diverse range of colleagues to stand for election to the Council. It worked,” the report states. “We recommend that the current procedures remain in place."
Under the current system, any Faculty member who receives at least three nominations qualifies automatically for election. After the reform of the policies, the report says the FAS dean no longer had to recruit candidates.
Although the report does not recommend any changes to the Faculty Council election policies, it does propose two suggestions. First, the report suggests that the Faculty “convene” a group each year of junior non-ladder faculty to participate in FAS governance with a liaison member who attends Faculty Council meetings.
Second, the report suggests that the FAS divisional deans, along with the deans of the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, not serve on the council, which “is a written version of an unwritten rule.”
At the Faculty meeting, the body will also vote to approve a preliminary announcement of Harvard Summer School courses for 2019.

Yvette J. Jackson will join the Music Department in July to teach interdisciplinary music courses as assistant professor in creative practice and critical inquiry.
Jackson, who currently serves as a visiting assistant professor of music at Amherst College, holds a doctorate in music-integrative studies.
In her new role at Harvard, Jackson will combine her expertise in music with her experience in theater. She will teach undergraduate classes for Theater, Dance, and Media, and graduate classes for the Music Department’s Creative Practice and Critical Inquiry program.
“I’m looking forward to being able to create classes that are cross-disciplinary. I always enjoy connecting music to other disciplines,” Jackson said. “So, creating classes for Theater, Dance, and Media is something I am really looking forward to.”
Suzannah E. Clark, the chair of the Music Department, said that during her time leading the department, she has made intentional changes to expand the department’s offerings to focus on types of music outside of the European tradition.
“The structure of our requirements was really centered around European music, or the Western tradition,” Clark said. “Now we’re very open, and we regard everyone in our department as equally contributing to what it means to study music.”
As part of these initiatives, the department founded the Creative Practice and Critical Inquiry program in collaboration with composer and musical improviser, Vijay Iyer. Iyer, a professor in the Music department, currently serves as the program’s graduate adviser.
“We make music, and we think about it,” Iyer said. “We think about how to talk about it, how to study it, how to analyze it, and how to theorize about it in ways that serve the process of music making.”
Jackson said she was excited to be involved in the new program and in the broader departmental changes. Jackson self-described her compositions as “radio operas” which are electroacoustic compositions drawing on historical context and using various sounds, often from computers, like sound bytes.
Iyer said that the Creative Practice and Critical Inquiry program marked the beginning of a shift in the identity of the department.
“We have all these music makers who have very diverse backgrounds, orientations, and perspectives on what music making consists of, how to study it, how to do it, and how to think about it,” he said.
Jackson’s recently announced appointment is another step in the department’s attempts to recognize and teach across more musical genres.
“She holds the view that everyone is a composer and everyone has creativity in them, and it's about the ability to make something happen with sound,” Clark said.
Prior to teaching at Amherst, Jackson taught music courses at the University of California, San Diego. In her final semester at Amherst next spring, she will teach a course on identity and electroacoustic music history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a near-unanimous vote, the Undergraduate Council called for the College to preserve shopping week — the one-week period at the beginning of the semester when students can sample classes without officially enrolling — in its current form.
The vote passed the Council, 22–2, at the UC’s last meeting of the semester Sunday.
In recent months, administrators and faculty members have formed a committee to investigate alternatives to shopping week, such as a pre-registration system. Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh met with the Council in October to discuss the well-loved tradition, and announced a series of faculty-led "listening sessions" for students to give feedback on the proposed change.
All three UC presidential tickets running in November’s election said they would advocate for shopping week to remain in place if victorious. Incoming UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who won the election with running mate Julia M. Huesa ’20, led a student town hall on the issue in October, and has repeatedly called for more student input in the process, including after administrators cancelled a scheduled UC town hall and instead scheduled the listening sessions.
In its statement, the Council cited a recent survey of 1,883 students that showed what they called “overwhelming” support for shopping week.
“Due to the current state of academic advising, shopping week remains crucial to course selection,” the statement reads. “Any proposal to replace shopping week would necessitate a significant rehaul of current advising programs, which would be difficult to implement in tandem with significant changes to course enrollment procedure.”
The statements adds that the UC believes shopping week to be a “quintessential, invaluable, and irreplaceable piece” of the undergraduate experience, and that the Council will “tirelessly fight” to retain it.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Alexander R. Miller, associate dean of student engagement, swore in Palaniappan and Huesa as the new president and vice president of the Council.
The UC also elected new members of its executive committee at the meeting. For the first time in several years, a freshman — Elm Yard Representative Jack M. Swanson ’22 — will serve as treasurer of the Council. Outgoing Rules Committee Chair Cade S. Palmer ’20, a Crimson sports chair, will take over as the Council’s secretary.
In an interview after the meeting, Swanson said he believes he has the requisite experience to manage the Council’s budget, pointing to his position in high school as the finance director of a multi-million dollar youth political committee in North Carolina.
He nonetheless acknowledged his relative youth — especially compared to the outgoing treasurer, Nadine M. Khoury ’20, who previously served as treasurer of the First-Year Class Committee — and wondered why it hadn’t come up in the debate over his nomination.
“I was surprised it didn’t get brought up,” he said.
Swanson, who ran unopposed, will take over the Council’s purse at a time of relative financial stability for the UC, with a significantly expanded budget due to an increase in the student activities fee that undergraduates pay as part of the College’s cost of attendance.
Swanson promised at the meeting to secure the long-term finances of the UC, including through the establishment of an endowment to promote the Council’s financial “independence,” an idea he said administrators have endorsed.
“We want to have a good working relationship with the administration and the first way to do that is to show them that we are an independent organization that can look to the long-term, rather than looking year-to-year,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 60 students crowded into a Boylston Hall classroom Friday to discuss their perceptions of the term “Asian American” in light of the admissions lawsuit challenging Harvard’s affirmative action policies.
The event entitled, “What is Asian America?” was the result of collaboration between the Asian American Women’s Association and six other cultural organizations. Organizers said they were inspired to host the event after seeing or taking part in a number of campus-wide events about the lawsuit and Asian-American identity.
Cayla S. Lee ’21, a Asian American Women’s Association officer, said that a lot of the discussions were focused on the opinions of Asian Americans and whether or not they benefit from affirmative action admissions policies.
“We thought it was necessary to have an on-campus dialogue about how we can complicate our notions of what it means to be Asian American, and in that way, make campus discussions a little more nuanced,” Lee said.
In November 2014, anti-affirmative action group Students For Fair Admissions sued Harvard, alleging the College’s race conscious admissions policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants. The case went to trial for three weeks in October and November and will extend until at least February 2019.
Though prompted by the ongoing lawsuit, students primarily discussed their personal conceptualizations of the term “Asian American.”
Participants discussed the political and social history of the term “Asian American” and what they considered the advantages and shortcomings of the classification. Attendees shared anecdotes about how the term has been applied to them by others. They also discussed intersectional representation within the Asian-American community — particularly focusing on how Southeast Asians, South Asians, and Pacific Islanders are often underrepresented by Asian-American advocacy groups.
“I had not really considered the distinction between Asian American and Pacific Islander from more than a geographic perspective,” Starr H. Rhee ’21 said. “I always thought we were grouped because people think we look alike and so because of that we have shared lived experiences, but really, Pacific Islanders have to deal with a whole different power dynamic that we usually don’t have to think about as Asian Americans.”
G. Stewart Barnes, a former chaplain of Harvard and notable donor to the Boston Asian American Film Festival, was also in attendance. He said he was encouraged by the dialogue and is eager to see how conversations regarding race and its impact will develop over time.
“It is a fact that students, not just Harvard students, but students everywhere, are going to be more focused on personal identity issues,” he said. “But you have a lifetime ahead of you to focus on that, and I fully understand the focus here.”
Jasmine Y. Parmley '21, a member of the Asian American Women’s Association, said the group plans to host similar discussions on Asian-American identity in the future, particularly focusing on the the identities of female and queer Asian Americans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of soon-to-be College graduates capped off their last semester with the Midyear Graduates Recognition Ceremony at the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
The ceremony provides students graduating after the fall semester, rather than in the spring, an opportunity to celebrate their achievement with their families. Organized by the 2019 Class Committee and the Harvard Alumni Association, the event featured several speakers and a reception for the 118 midyear graduates, and their families and friends. Some students are graduating a semester early after already fulfilling academic requirements, but most midyear graduates have taken a semester or more away from campus.
Julia E. Canick ’17-’19 said during her speech at the ceremony that student reasons for taking time off vary, but ultimately aren’t important. Canick said she had taken three semesters off due to health issues.
“Maybe you took time to work on a campaign, or left to seek medical treatment, or simply needed a break,” Canick said. “The reason, though, doesn’t matter. What matters is that you came back.”
Canick said that leaving the College for a semester and deciding to return can both be difficult choices, especially at Harvard.
“We took time away from an environment that often seems to emphasize being ‘on-track’, and we returned when we weren’t on said ‘track’,” Canick said.
During his remarks, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said that he himself graduated off-cycle from Cornell as an undergraduate, reflecting on the impact that the decision had on his life.
“December graduates, I feel a particularly special bond with you because I too was a December graduate. It was not something I had planned when I started college, but it actually turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me,” Khurana said.
“Without these moments of serendipity, we risk leading lives that are extremely efficient but monstrously dull, because it is those unexpected moments that makes life both messy and majestic,” Khurana added.
Speakers often touched on the stigma surrounding “off-cycle” students, and each time the friends and family in attendance were quick to show their support with laughs and loud cheers.
Midyear graduate Eehjoon Kwon ’18-’19 was excited to finish her studies and said she wasn’t expecting so many other students to be graduating in the fall.
Still, Kwon says she feels “not completely graduated yet” — she and her fellow graduates still have final exams to take before the semester’s end.
“I didn’t know there were going to be this many other people off-cycle like me, and it’s really great to hear that I’m not alone,” Kwon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five sophomores declared Environmental Science and Engineering — Harvard’s newest concentration — this year, according to Patrick D. Ulrich, the program’s associate director for undergraduate studies.
Approved in the spring, the newest offering became the College’s 50th field of concentration. Previously, students interested in the field received a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science in the Engineering Sciences concentration on a special track.
The change maintains the bachelor of science option, known as an S.B. at Harvard, in Engineering Sciences and replaces the bachelor of arts option in Engineering Sciences with an A.B. solely in the new Environmental Science and Engineering concentration.
Seven sophomores declared the older S.B. in Engineering Sciences this fall, in addition to the five who went with the new A.B. in Environmental Science and Engineering, according to Ulrich.
Ulrich said that making Environmental Science and Engineering its own concentration gives the field more visibility; there were few substantive changes to the curriculum.
“We were sort of buried in Engineering Sciences. Freshmen would come in and have to look really hard to find us,” Ulrich said. “We wanted to make sure that students know that we offer this awesome program in Environmental Science and Engineering. This puts it on equal footing with all of the other concentrations.”
Marissa Saenger ’18–’19, who switched into the new A.B. program this year, said the change makes it easier to find the environment-focused field among all of the Engineering Sciences options.
“Before it was kind of hidden among Engineering Sciences and all the possible tracks and now it’s just standing on its own,” Saenger said.
Tatiana S. Jimenez ’21, who recently declared an A.B. in the new field, said the change affected her perception of what was possible in the concentration.
“I knew I didn’t want to become an engineer in the future,” Jimenez said. “There’s probably a good chance I wouldn’t have declared Engineering Sciences with a track in ESE. If it had never changed, I don’t think I would’ve gone down that route.”
In addition to the recently declared sophomores, several upperclassmen switched from Engineering Sciences on the specialized track to the new concentration.
“Most of our seniors decided they were going to stay in Engineering Sciences track and finish what they’ve been doing all along and most of our juniors have decided to make the switch,” Ulrich said.
Julia Henry ’20, who switched to the A.B. in Environmental Science and Engineering, said that she appreciated “flexibility” in the new program — some previously required classes like the College’s introduction to Computer Science course are no longer part of the mandatory curriculum, she said.
Beverly Ge ’20, another junior who opted for the new A.B., said she couldn’t see “any downside” to switching to the Environmental Science and Engineering concentration.
“My friends and I, we were definitely very excited when the news came out,” said Ge, who described the program as “very accommodating” for those transitioning to the new concentration. “I don’t see myself becoming a technical engineer so doing an A.B. made more sense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard undergraduate has filed suit against the University charging it overstepped when it opened an investigation this October into allegations he raped a non-Harvard student in an apartment building located hundreds of miles from campus in summer 2017.
The unnamed male student, dubbed “John Doe” in the complaint, filed a civil lawsuit Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. He contends that Harvard does not have the authority to open an investigation into sexual assault allegations levied by a non-Harvard student regarding an incident that did not take place on University property.
He is demanding Harvard cease to investigate him and pay him $75,000 in damages, as well as compensate him for any costs incurred during litigation.
Doe’s suit states that, during summer 2017, Doe and “Jane Roe” — the unnamed woman he allegedly raped — were both working internships “in a city hundreds of miles away from Harvard.” That city was almost certainly Washington, D.C. Additional court filings state that the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department investigated the alleged assault but ultimately decided not to prosecute the case.
Doe wrote in his suit against Harvard that he is currently facing a civil lawsuit filed by Roe.
The University’s Office for Dispute Resolution opened an investigation into Doe in October 2018, according to Doe’s complaint. ODR handles all allegations of sexual or gender-based harassment at Harvard in keeping with Title IX, a federal anti-sex discrimination law.
In arguing ODR does not have the jurisdiction to investigate his case, Doe pointed to University policies related to sexual and gender-based harassment. Those policies — available online — apply only to misconduct perpetrated by University affiliates while on campus or in connection with University-recognized activities. The policy also covers harassment that may create a “hostile environment” for other Harvard affiliates.
Doe, though, is likely subject to both University policy and guidelines followed by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as a student of the College. The University's overarching policy — which Doe referenced — does not preclude schools within Harvard from producing and enforcing their own, more expansive sets of rules.
FAS policies and procedures are broader in scope than comparable University policies. Per its guidelines, FAS may hold all students to the expectation that they behave in a “in a mature and responsible manner” no matter where they are.
“It is the expectation of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that all students, whether or not they are on campus or are currently enrolled in a degree program, will behave in a mature and responsible manner,” the policy reads. “Consistent with this principle, sexual and gender-based misconduct are not tolerated by the FAS even when, because they do not have the effect of creating a hostile environment for a member of the University community, they fall outside the jurisdiction of the University Policy.”
Recent federal Title IX guidelines proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos could complicate Doe’s suit. The new rules, released by the department on Nov. 16, limit the scope of acts of sexual harassment universities are required to investigate. Specifically, the rules stipulate schools are not required to open investigations into alleged acts of sexual misconduct that took place outside the bounds of a school "program or activity."
In his complaint, Doe charges Harvard with two counts: breach of contract and breach of covenant of faith and fair dealing. He alleges that, in allowing him to attend classes in exchange for “substantial amounts of money,” Harvard created a reasonable expectation that Doe would earn a degree from the school. One possible outcome of an ODR investigation is expulsion.
“Harvard has breached, and is breaching, its contractual obligations by subjecting Mr. Doe to a disciplinary process that—in the ways, and for the reasons, set out above—is arbitrary, capricious, malicious, and being conducted in bad faith,” the complaint states.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
The complaint states that Doe met Roe on the night of July 22, 2017 at a party held at Roe’s apartment. There, they “engaged in sexual activity,” to which Doe alleges Roe consented. Roe, however, alleges Doe raped her, according to the lawsuit. The suit states Roe later filed a complaint with the local police department.
Roe filed a civil personal injury suit against Doe in March 2018. That suit is currently ongoing.
Doe states that ODR informed him that the investigation into him is based on Roe’s allegations. In an email submitted as an exhibit in the lawsuit, Ilissa K. Povich, ODR senior investigator, wrote that the College Title IX coordinator filed the case, then reached out to Roe to ask her to participate as a complainant in the investigation.
After first questioning ODR’s jurisdiction, Doe asked Povich to temporarily suspend the investigation pending the results of the lawsuit filed in March by Roe. Doe stated a simultaneous ODR investigation would have a “serious impact” on his ability to defend himself in the ongoing civil case, according to the complaint.
But Povich rejected this request, stating that Harvard University Police Department confirmed with D.C. police that law enforcement did not plan to investigate the allegations, according to an email filed as an exhibit.
Though FAS policy allows the school to pause an investigation in order to avoid interfering with active criminal investigations, it does not mention the possibility of deferring an investigation to accommodate ongoing civil litigation.
In his complaint, Doe states that the ODR investigation is unnecessary because Roe is already “assured of having her day in court” through her civil suit. He adds that, in that suit, Doe “will be entitled to all the protections of a defendant in a civil case,” including subpoena power and the right to cross-examine Roe and other witnesses.
On Nov. 15, Harvard temporarily paused its investigation into Doe, the complaint states. It reopened the investigation on Nov. 27 “with no changes to its existing procedures” and requested an interview with Doe the next day, according to the complaint.
Doe noted in his complaint that the temporary suspension of the investigation coincided with the Education Department’s release of new Title IX guidelines — “rules with which Harvard’s current proceedings do not comply,” the suit reads.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson did not respond to questions regarding Harvard’s decision to pause the investigation and whether it related to DeVos’s new guidelines.
In addition to filing a motion requesting a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, Doe has filed a motion to proceed with the case under a pseudonym.
Judge Indira Talwani ’82, who is presiding over the case, set a date of Dec. 11 for a hearing on Doe’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the new Title IX rules proposed in November 2018 would forbid universities from opening investigations into alleged acts of sexual misconduct that took place outside the bounds of a school “program or activity.” In fact, the new rules would merely stipulate schools are not required to open investigations into alleged acts of sexual misconduct that took place outside the bounds of a school "program or activity."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow traveled to San Diego last week as part of a series of trips he has taken to make the case for Harvard’s relevance to people beyond Cambridge.
During the trip, Bacow spoke at a local gathering of alumni Thursday and visited the Health Science High School and Middle College on Friday.
At the event for alumni, Bacow spoke on a wide variety of topics from the “admissions case to public service to Allston and efforts to tackle climate change and the opioid crisis,” according to University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson.
English Professor Elisa F. New accompanied Bacow on the high school visit, where her class ‘Poetry in America’ is being taught through Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education. New led the class in conversation, discussing various themes within the works of poet Emily Dickinson.
The trip is one of several that Bacow has taken in recent months. After he was appointed as Harvard’s 29th president last February, he pledged to reach out to all parts of the country to address critiques that Harvard caters to coastal elites. In September, Bacow visited Detroit and Pontiac, Mich., where he grew up, in order to make the case for the positive role the University can play in people’s lives across the country.
“I think it’s important that people understand that graduates of Harvard are working hard to make places like Detroit more vibrant, more interesting, and to create opportunity for others,” Bacow said during an event in Michigan.
Bacow spoke of his Midwestern upbringing during his remarks at the Health Science High School and Middle College, a charter school in San Diego.
“Being here took me back in time to being a high school student myself,” Bacow said. “Both my parents were immigrants — and actually both were refugees to this country — and so education was really important to them.”
“They thought it was a way to provide a better life for me and my sister,” he added.
Former University President Drew G. Faust also took several trips to communities across the country during her tenure, traveling to Philadelphia and Cincinnati in the waning days of her presidency.
During a wider discussion on higher education, Bacow said that students “can get a great education anywhere,” but emphasized what you do with that education is critical.
“For almost any college or university in this country, if you apply yourself, if you seek out the right people, you can get a great education,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Allston Ed Portal, removed from the buzz of construction and traffic on Western Avenue, is a hub of activity on an average Tuesday afternoon.
Children work on projects from telling stories about humanity's victory in soccer over extraterrestrial beings in a "Universe Cup," to extracting strawberry DNA, to presenting improv skits.
Ten years ago, the space at 224 Western Ave. was an unused garage owned by Harvard. In March 2015, Harvard opened a brand new facility to house the Harvard Ed Portal as part of the University’s “cooperation agreements” with the city of Boston amidst Harvard’s long-term expansion into Allston.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, former University President Drew G. Faust halted the construction of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ planned campus in Allston. Despite this setback, the University followed through on their agreed upon plans for community outreach detailed in their agreements with Boston. The Ed Portal opened in June 2008.
One of the agreements was the creation of the Ed Portal. The Portal, run by the University’s public affairs and communications arm, serves as a hub for Harvard’s neighborhood outreach efforts in Allston.
Among these efforts is the Ed Portal mentoring program, which pairs Harvard undergraduates as mentors with Allston elementary school students. The mentors and mentees meet once a week to work through projects combining personal interests and academic or personal growth topics.
The program was the brainchild of Robert A. Lue, faculty director of the Ed Portal and a professor of the practice of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Lue, aware of Harvard’s future in Allston, approached the University more than 10 years ago with an idea to increase the University’s engagement with the Allston neighborhood.
“The mentoring program was one of the critical things we wanted in the community of Allston,” Lue said.
The program started with an emphasis on science and math but has since expanded to “virtually every field you can think of,” Lue said.
“What we’re really trying to do is to create an opportunity here in Allston for Harvard students, the College students, the graduate students as well, to come and form a new community with the youth of Allston," he said.
For Christopher Li ’18, this appeal worked.
“Getting off campus, kind of getting to a different space, working with people who aren’t Harvard students, who are high school, middle school students from the local community, breaking out of that bubble was refreshing, but also a bit inconvenient,” Li said.
Li said the distance of the Ed Portal from Harvard’s main campus across the Charles River in Cambridge poses a bit of a challenge. Currently, there is only one Harvard shuttle route that travels through Allston.
Susan L. Johnson, a manager at the Ed Portal, also noted logistical difficulties in determining schedules between mentors and mentees. At the start of each semester, as mentors select their courses, the Ed Portal juggles varying schedules as they try to match mentors with mentees. Johnson said this also leads to a fluctuation in the amount of mentors each semester, sometimes causing a shortage.
On Sunday afternoon, the Ed Portal filled with nearly 100 mentors, mentees, families, local Allston residents, and Harvard affiliates. Each semester, the mentees, with help from their mentors, present the projects they have worked on during the semester. This year’s fall 2018 cohort consisted of 20 mentors and 161 mentees.
Some of the guests present Sunday were particularly high-profile.
State Rep. Kevin G. Honan and Boston City Council member Mark S. Ciommo came to show their support, along with University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
This was Bacow’s first visit to the Ed Portal, where he spent roughly 30 minutes greeting mentors and mentees. Mentees excitedly showed Bacow around their science lab, where smoke from dry ice tumbled around the room, and showcased their projects, including an iPad-controlled robot that erased markers from a whiteboard.
Bacow then shared a story from his own youth in Pontiac, Mich.; he said he was a “math and science geek” growing up.
“I actually had my life changed by a mentor, who I encountered actually when I was in high school,” Bacow said.
This mentor, his high school librarian, introduced him to a biography of Thomas Jefferson, which helped him “emerge a little bit from my math and science shell.” He attributes his current deep love of history and literature to this experience.
“I hope you guys will always be stimulated to keep learning,” Bacow encouraged the students. “But I also hope that someday you guys will become mentors yourself.”
Bacow’s concluding message expressed hope the program will continue to inspire young students to look forward and for older students to give back.
He added, “We’re creating and reinforcing the tradition of each generation helping the next.”

Convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein is not a Harvard alum. Nor is he a faculty member or an affiliate of the University. In fact, he does not even hold a college degree.
But the billionaire — who for years operated a sex ring of underage girls out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home, the Miami Herald reported in a three-part feature Wednesday — nonetheless boasts deep and longstanding ties to Harvard.
Epstein has donated millions of dollars to the University. His money funded the construction of at least one campus building, still standing today. He cultivated cozy friendships with top Harvard administrators including a former University president. And he forged close professional and personal ties to Alan M. Dershowitz, a high-profile professor emeritus at Harvard Law School who also allegedly had sexual relations with a minor.
When the allegations against Epstein first became public more than a decade ago, University representatives told The Crimson they had no plans to return any money the school received from him.
Now — as the Herald’s reporting is once again focusing national attention on Epstein’s and Dershowitz’s alleged misconduct — Harvard is staying quiet. University spokespeople declined to comment for this story. Harvard also refused to comment publicly on the allegations against Dershowitz.
The Herald reported they had identified about 80 women who said they had been molested or sexually abused by Epstein between 2001 and 2006.
Witnesses and alleged victims testified in civil court that hundreds of girls traveled to Epstein’s homes over the years under the pretense they would be paid to give Epstein “massages.” Epstein forced the women to perform sexual acts during most massages, according to the Herald. The Herald described the operation as “cult-like” and akin to a “sexual pyramid scheme” in which girls acted as recruiters, attracting other underage girls.
A 14-year-old girl and her parents went to the police in 2005 to report that Epstein had molested her at his Palm Beach mansion. That report kickstarted a legal battle that has continued to the present day.
One of the women Epstein allegedly paid for sexual services — Virginia Roberts — stated in a 2015 affidavit that Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell directed her to have sex with Dershowitz and others. Roberts wrote in the affidavit that she had sexual intercourse with Dershowitz six times starting at age 16. Dershowitz has denied these allegations multiple times over several years, and the judge presiding over the case ultimately struck the allegations from the record on the grounds that they were not relevant to the suit.
Dershowitz was not merely friendly with Epstein — he also served as part of the seven-person legal team that defended the billionaire in court. The Herald reported that, as part of his defense of Epstein, Dershowitz sought to portray some of the underage girls who had accused Epstein of sex crimes — many of them near-homeless or hailing from broken homes — as unreliable witnesses. Dershowitz denied this, telling the Herald he is “not an investigator.”
Though Epstein faced a potential life sentence, in 2007 his legal team and prosecutors struck an extraordinary plea deal: 13 months in the county jail and the shutdown of an FBI probe into Epstein’s sex crimes. Current Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta ’90, who served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time, formed part of the prosecution team that arranged the plea deal.
Epstein pled guilty in state court to two charges of felony prostitution. After finishing out his 13-month sentence in 2009, Epstein went on to pursue charity work and scientific research projects. He currently faces a civil lawsuit filed by Bradley J. Edwards — a lawyer who represents some of Epstein’s victims — that alleges Epstein “sued him to punish him for representing several of his victims,” according to the Herald. A separate lawsuit filed by some of the women accusing Epstein of sexual assault seeks to invalidate the 2007 plea deal, but it has been stalled in court for nearly a decade.
The Herald’s reporting revealed how Epstein was able to “manipulate the criminal justice system” using his riches, power, and influence.
Before Epstein was indicted, though, his riches, power, and influence earned him a different kind of special treatment. The billionaire enjoyed access to U.S. presidents and billionaire business leaders — and to scores of Harvard professors, administrators, and affiliates.
Though Epstein is not a Harvard alumnus or affiliate, he has a history of strong financial ties to the University.
In a 2003 profile, The Crimson reported that many of Epstein’s friends described him as a “long-time, low-profile” donor.
In 1990, Epstein partnered with fellow billionaire Leslie H. Wexner to fund the construction of a new building at Harvard Hillel — Rosovsky Hall, named after former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky, one of Epstein’s oldest friends.
Around 1998, Epstein helped fund the research of Anne Harrington ’82, a History of Science professor who also serves as Pforzheimer House faculty dean. Harrington wrote in an email Sunday that Epstein served on the advisory board of the Harvard Society of Mind, Brain, and Behavior at the time of the donation.
Harrington called Epstein’s actions “terrible.”
“He became interested in some work I was doing on the placebo effect and offered me modest funding to pull together an interdisciplinary group that would work on the subject,” Harrington wrote. “Had I known then even a hint of what we all have subsequently learned about him, I never would have accepted it.”
Roughly a half-decade later, Epstein approached David R. Gergen, a Harvard Kennedy School professor, to inquire about making a donation to the school. In an interview Sunday, Gergen said the encounter — which he said took place around 2004 or 2005 — marked the first time he met Epstein.
“It turned out he was serious and we, of course, had to do due diligence on him as we do on every donor, and the due diligence report that came back said that there were some questions about his past but that the University saw no reason not to receive the potential gift,” Gergen said.
Gergen said the idea for the donation was eventually scrapped.
“Somewhere along the way, serious questions began to arise about his past and at that point, we slowed the conversations way down and became very wary of making sure it was the right thing to do or not and eventually both he and we — the conversation waned and eventually ended several years ago,” he said.
Most notably, in 2003, Epstein pledged a $30 million donation to Harvard to fund the work of mathematical biologist Martin A. Nowak. His donation established the University’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which Nowak directs today.
Nowak, a professor of Mathematics and Biology, did not respond to a request for comment.
When Epstein was first charged in July 2006, several recipients of his donations — including New Mexico Governor Bill B. Richardson and New York attorney general and then-gubernatorial candidate Eliot L. Spitzer — distanced themselves from the billionaire.
Harvard did not.
Former University President Derek C. Bok, then serving as Harvard’s interim president, stood by his longstanding assertion that the University should not “have an obligation to investigate each donor and impose detailed moral standards.” University spokespeople said in 2006 that Harvard had no plans to return any money it had received from Epstein.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson declined to comment on any questions related to Epstein on Sunday, including one that explicitly asked whether Harvard plans to return Epstein’s donation in light of the Herald’s reporting and the new details it unearthed.
“We decline to comment,” Jackson wrote in a one-sentence emailed statement Sunday.
Epstein’s ties to Harvard extended to cozy chats with the school’s top brass and premier scientific minds. In an interview Friday, Dershowitz said that, over the course of several years, Epstein frequently hosted “seminars” in Cambridge on evolutionary biology.
Dershowitz said that numerous prominent Harvard professors and administrators attended the discussions. Participants included Lawrence H. Summers, who was serving as the University’s president at the time, Rosovsky, Gergen, and Stephen M. Kosslyn. Kosslyn, who is a Psychology professor emeritus, also received research funding from Epstein.
“I am amazed by the connections he has in the scientific world,” Nowak told The Crimson in 2003. “He knows an amazing number of scientists; he knows everyone you can imagine.”
Rosovsky wrote in an email that the seminars took place at the offices of Harvard’s Program of Evolutionary Dynamics and that he “attended a couple of sessions and lost interest.”
Kosslyn could not be reached for comment on Sunday. An assistant for Summers declined to comment.
The Crimson reported in 2003 that Epstein maintained tight friendships with Kosslyn, Rosovsky, and Dershowitz, among other Harvard luminaries. Epstein was also close with Summers, who served alongside Epstein on the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, two elite international relations organizations.
“We all knew Jeffrey Epstein as somebody who was contributing to Harvard,” Dershowitz said in an interview Friday. “None of us ever, ever suspected that he had any connection with anybody underage.”
Dershowitz was first implicated in Epstein’s crimes in December 2014 when a civil case challenging Epstein’s plea deal alleged that Dershowitz forced a then-underaged, unnamed woman to have sex with him several times in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The Herald identified the woman as Roberts.
Dershowitz — who is famous for representing defendants like O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bülow — repeatedly denied the allegations at the time, criticizing Roberts and her lawyers for including the charges. Dershowitz has since continued to deny the allegations. The presiding judge struck the allegations from the record in 2015 without directly addressing their veracity.
Dershowitz acknowledged that he once traveled to Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion to receive a massage, according to the Herald. But in his deposition in the case, Dershowitz said the massage involved no sexual activity and was performed by a professional masseuse — and that his wife was present the whole time.
In a Friday interview with The Crimson, Dershowitz once again strongly denied Roberts’s allegations. Dershowitz said the accusations against him form part of an extortion plot against Wexner, the chairman and chief of L Brands — the corporation that owns Victoria’s Secret.
“It’s a completely made-up story, I never met the woman, I don’t know her, I don’t know anything beyond what she said and it’s just a totally made up story,” Dershowitz said.
In addition to identifying the woman with whom Dershowitz allegedly had illicit sexual relations, the Herald piece sheds light on the methods the law professor reportedly employed to defend Epstein.
The Herald piece reveals that, after being hired by Epstein in 2005, Dershowitz flew to Florida and met with then-Palm Beach State Attorney Barry E. Krischer in an attempt to convince him that the girls accusing Epstein of sexual misconduct were not sufficiently credible to testify in court.
He shared the results of his personal investigation into one of the girls with Krischer, according to the Herald. Dershowitz showed Krischer photos scraped from the girl’s social media that depicted her using marijuana, the Herald reported.
In a written public statement in 2011, Acosta accused Epstein’s lawyers of carrying out a “year-long assault” on prosecutors, investigating their families and personal lives. Private investigators for Epstein allegedly posed as police officers and followed the girls and their families, according to the Herald.
Dershowitz, in an interview with the Herald, said he had nothing to do with gathering information on the girls, their families, or the prosecutors.
“I’m not an investigator,” he said. “My only job was to negotiate and try the case when it comes to trial.”
The Pipeline Parity Project, a Law School student group whose mission is to end harassment and discrimination in the legal profession, wrote in a statement that the allegations against Dershowitz are perturbing.
“The allegations against Alan Dershowitz are disturbing, as is Harvard's silence in response,” the group wrote. “Harvard maintains its policy of institutional silence, and our community is left with the harm that has been done."
They also noted that Dershowitz retains his emeritus professor status, as does Jorge I. Dominguez — a retired Government professor who was accused of sexual harassment by at least 20 women over the past 40 years.
The group denounced Harvard’s failure to launch a public investigation into the allegations against Dershowitz and compared it to the school’s decision not to investigate charges of sexual assault brought against Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court this fall. Kavanaugh taught at the Law School for roughly a decade before indicating he would not return to teach his class in January 2019.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 — a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group — wrote in an email that she finds the allegations against both Dershowitz and Epstein “deeply disturbing.”
“Efforts to protect perpetrators of sexual violence are unconscionable,” Goldberg wrote.
Dershowitz provided The Crimson with a copy of a letter to the editor that he sent to the Herald. In the letter, Dershowitz states that he not only “denied” that he had sex with Roberts — as was reported in the Herald — but that he “disproved it” during an investigation run by former FBI chief Louis J. Freeh.
Jackson, the University spokesperson, declined to comment on any questions related to Dershowitz, including whether Harvard has investigated or plans to investigate the allegations against him.

A group of fraternities, sororities, and students is suing Harvard over its social group sanctions, alleging the penalties are discriminatory, coercive, and unconstitutional.
The groups filed two lawsuits Monday, one in federal and one in Massachusetts court. The federal complaint — filed by sororities, fraternities, and three unnamed College students — alleges that the sanctions constitute sex-based discrimination and violate federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX and the United States Constitution.
The Massachusetts complaint, brought by two Greek organizations, asserts the sanctions violate the state’s Civil Rights Act and the Massachusetts Constitution because they deny students equal treatment based on their sex.
The state case requests an injunction barring Harvard from continuing its sanctions and demands the University pay the plaintiffs an unspecified amount of money to make up for what they allege the penalties cost them. Both cases ask for a court judgment that condemns Harvard’s social group policy and a court order requiring the College to cancel its sanctions.
Harvard’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity team athletic captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The plaintiffs in the Massachusetts suit are the international parent group of sorority Alpha Phi, Harvard’s newly reinstated chapter of Alpha Phi, and a management company for chapters of sorority Delta Gamma.
In the federal case, the plaintiffs are the international organizations for two sororities, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma; the parent groups for two fraternities, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi; Harvard’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon; and three current Harvard students who are also members of all-male social clubs. The undergraduates are not named in the suit.
Lawyers for the social groups filed the federal suit online, but one attorney — David A. Russcol of law firm Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein — traveled to the Suffolk County Superior Court in person Monday morning to hand-deliver the state complaint. As he left the courthouse, Russcol said he feels confident the suit has a "strong chance of success."
"Harvard has really shown a disregard for the rights of its students to associate with people they want to associate with," he said. "What they do off campus shouldn't be any of Harvard's business. It's disappointing that the plaintiffs have had to take this action."
Harvard could not immediately be reached for comment Monday. When faced with criticisms of the sanctions in the past, administrators have vigorously defended the policy and argued that single-gender social groups promote exclusivity.
“At Harvard, we have a very specific mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders for our diverse and interconnected society,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a May interview. “We do not believe that it is effective to basically institutionalize segregation.”
Legal threats began to loom almost immediately after the College debuted its sanctions in May 2016. Four months later in September 2016, the all-male Fly Club retained a group of lawyers to explore its options in defying the sanctions — and the men’s final clubs repeatedly weighed and discounted suing in the years since. Ultimately, no final clubs joined the suits filed Monday.
As recently as October, Khurana seemed confident Harvard would not face a lawsuit over the penalties. Asked how worried he was about litigation, Khurana said no one at Harvard had asked him to start preparing for the possibility that some single-gender groups might sue.
“Personally, I believe that most of these organizations are trying to find a way to become inclusive and evolve,” he said in October. “It’s just not always easy.”
Long before the sanctions drew legal fire, they earned blowback from Harvard professors, students, and alumni — as well as a campaign to kill the penalties on Capitol Hill.
When former University President Drew G. Faust announced the sanctions roughly two-and-a-half years ago, she spurred the ire of single-gender organizations and some faculty members alike.
Both vowed to resist however they could.
Less than three weeks after Faust’s announcement, Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, a former dean of the College, filed a faculty motion meant to strike down the sanctions. Though Lewis temporarily withdrew his motion in January 2017 — after Khurana convened a faculty committee and asked it to revise or replace the policy — he filed another in August, calling the work of that committee disappointing. The faculty committee ultimately opted to keep the sanctions unchanged.
Lewis’s motion failed to pass at a November 2017 Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting; 90 FAS members voted for it while 130 opposed it. And in December 2017, the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — voted to formally adopt the penalties, seemingly guaranteeing they were here to stay.
Beyond the gates of Harvard Yard, though, the final clubs had started making plans of their own. Rather than accepting the policies, several final clubs and Greek groups opted to take a legislative path to nix the sanctions.
Over the past year, two groups — the Cambridge Coalition and the Fraternal Government Relations Coalition — have worked with D.C. law firm Arnold & Porter to lobby lawmakers to oppose Harvard’s sanctions. Arnold & Porter, which boasts a top-notch reputation in Washington and a long list of contacts inside the government, will also represent the plaintiffs in the federal suit against the sanctions filed Monday.
The Cambridge Coalition, which formed in recent months specifically to counter Harvard’s social group policy, consists of all-male final clubs the Fly Club, the A.D. Club, and the Porcellian Club, as well as the Cambridge chapters of fraternities Sigma Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon. FGRC — comprising the North American Interfraternity Conference, the National Panhellenic Conference, and the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee — retained Arnold & Porter in 2015.
Neither the Cambridge Coalition nor the FGRC signed on to either suit Monday, though two fraternities who are members of the Cambridge Coalition — Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi — are also plaintiffs in the federal case.
Both groups focused their lobbying efforts on a specific provision in the PROSPER Act — a higher education bill introduced in December 2017 to the U.S. House of Representatives — that aims to prevent colleges and universities from penalizing members of “recognized” single-gender social organizations. Opponents of the sanctions hope to tweak the wording of the bill to ensure it applies to the College’s sanctions.
If the coalitions succeed and the bill passes, Harvard could be forced to choose between its social group penalties and millions of dollars in federal research funding.
But that almost certainly won’t happen. The PROSPER Act, a Republican proposal, garnered scant support even among conservatives. Given Democrats flipped the House in November, the legislation is unlikely to pass before the end of this congressional term.
Final club affiliates engaged in the lobbying efforts have said they view litigation as a “last resort.” 
Harvey A. Silverglate, a lawyer representing the Fly Club, wrote in an April 2017 email to The Crimson that he and his law firm, Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein, would explore the possibility of litigation “just in case” the Fly Club decides that a lawsuit “becomes necessary.”
Now, the final clubs’ “last resort” has become a reality — though no final clubs are formally involved.
One of the key contentions of both suits is that Harvard used strong-arm tactics to force social groups to go co-ed — strategies, the plaintiffs allege, that amount to coercion frowned upon by state and federal law.
The state suit notes that the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act provides a cause of action against any person who, by threats, intimidation or coercion, interferes with another individual’s enjoyment of his or her constitutional rights.
To prove Harvard coerced campus social groups into going gender-neutral, the state suit details several incidents — some of them previously unreported — in which Khurana and other administrators allegedly pressured social groups to abandon their single-gender status.
One episode the suit cites took place on March 29, 2016, when Khurana allegedly issued an ultimatum to the undergraduate leaders of male and female final clubs.
The clubs’ choice, as Khurana allegedly put it at the time, was simple: go co-ed or face the consequences. He gave leaders of the groups until April 15 to make up their minds. The Crimson reported that Khurana had issued this ultimatum at the time.
More broadly, College leaders bore a personal vendetta against the groups, the suits allege. The complaints state Harvard officials often threatened to severely punish groups that did not go co-ed and comply with the College’s sanctions.
Khurana’s primary goal as dean, according to the plaintiffs, was to sanction single-gender social groups as part of an effort to ultimately remove them from campus altogether.
Early in his tenure, the dean held a series of meetings with leaders of social groups to make his intentions clear and to impress on them the dire consequences of noncompliance with the sanctions, the suits allege. In October 2014, Khurana met with the undergraduate and graduate leaders of 30 to 40 groups to hold what they thought would be a run-of-the-mill conversation about College policies.
But Khurana had other plans, according to the state complaint. He questioned the organizations’ values and said he doubted whether they aligned with the College’s mission. He closed the session by urging the groups to “do better,” suggesting they should go gender neutral.
The meeting was “uncomfortable and at times confrontational,” per the state filing.
The dean’s unwavering determination to implement the sanctions stemmed in part from a desire to avoid potential legal liability, according to the state brief. Khurana had learned prior to October 2014 that an Office of Civil Rights complaint alleged all-male final clubs were “major site[s] of sexual violence,” and Khurana was determined to address the problem by eliminating them, the suit states.
The Crimson reported in September 2017 that the 2014 OCR complaint — which spurred a federal investigation into the College’s compliance with Title IX — specifically cited all-male final clubs.
After the April 15 deadline passed, Khurana continued his alleged coercion, according to the briefs. In May, he told graduate leaders of male final clubs that he planned to “close” them if they did not go co-ed, the plaintiffs allege.
The state brief alleges Khurana told clubs that, though they had the option of choosing to admit members of all genders on their own, he would soon step in if they failed to do so.
Khurana’s efforts to push clubs towards co-ed status continued into the fall of 2015, per both suits. In meetings with male clubs’ graduate leadership, he threatened a slew of sanctions should the clubs disobey his urgings to go gender-neutral, per the Massachusetts complaint.
Khurana allegedly told leaders that he could expel undergraduates who chose to join single-gender social groups.
When Alexander R. Miller, the College’s associate dean of student engagement, became a main point of contact for single-gender groups in the last year or so, he adopted similar tactics to Khurana, per the complaints.
“Dean Miller has made veiled threats about the consequences of failing to comply with Harvard’s changing demands (such as, ‘you know what the alternative is’ or ‘we might have to go there’) and has, on at least one reported instance, screamed at a student regarding an aspect of a social organization’s transition,” per the state brief.
Khurana and Miller could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.
Harvard's threats, the plaintiffs allege, are not limited to the two administrators alone.
“Harvard has also singled out students who join single-sex organizations for scathing criticism in university-wide letters, emails, reports, and media articles,” the federal complaint reads. “Harvard has threatened to deny future professional opportunities beyond those specified in the Sanctions Policy.”
Another central claim of both suits is that Harvard displayed a pattern of gender-based discrimination in pursuing and implementing its sanctions.
In the federal lawsuit, plaintiffs allege that Harvard has acted in violation of Title IX policies that forbid discrimination. The federal complaint specifically alleges that the College’s sanctions unlawfully discipline students because they “associate with individuals of a particular sex.”
“Because Harvard’s Sanctions Policy metes out its punishment based on the sex of both the student who joins the forbidden organization and the other members of the forbidden organization, Harvard’s Sanctions Policy is sex discrimination twice over,” lawyers wrote.
In addition, the federal complaint alleges Harvard relied on stereotypes of men and women to justify the sanctions. The federal suit states the University promoted the view that men in all-male social groups are likely to engage in sexual violence and bigotry and that women join all-female social groups to deal with exclusion from all-male clubs.
The plaintiffs allege that, in an August 2016 meeting with members of some sororities, a Harvard administrator said sororities have “no value” on campus.
The plaintiffs further allege Harvard’s sanctions reflect the school’s skewed and biased vision of how male and female students should behave. The federal suit states the University subscribes to the notion that men and women who join single-gender social groups are failing to act like members of a “21st century society.”
“Harvard expressed the view that men and women who join single-sex organizations are do not act like modern men and women, exhibiting ‘behaviors and attitudes... at odds with the aspirations of the 21st century society to which the College hopes and expects our students will contribute,’” the lawyers wrote in the federal suit.
Moreover, the plaintiffs in the federal suit allege Harvard’s motivation for implementing the sanctions is inherently discriminatory. The complaint includes an accusation that the College hoped to “negatively affect” male students solely because they opt to join all-male groups in violation of Title IX.
The plaintiffs cite previous Harvard reports that allegedly connect “the single-sex character of all-male organizations to a raft of negative characteristics.” The lawyers claim that this constitutes an “anti-male bias” held by the crafters of the social group policy.
Khurana and other administrators, however, have repeatedly said the sanctions are meant to help improve diversity and inclusion on campus.
In December 2017, Faust and William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation, wrote that single-gender social groups “stand in the way of our ability to provide a fully challenging and inclusive educational experience to the diverse students currently on our campus.”
Harvard has 20 days to file a response to the state suit, according to Russcol.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week, both the men’s and women’s swimming teams traveled out to Austin, Texas for the Hall of Fame Invitational and the diving teams to Athens, Ga., for the Georgia Fall Invitational.
“The Texas meet is an opportunity to really suit up to see how we’ve progressed up to the midseason,” senior Grant Goddard said. “All the top swimming schools are there so it’s really good to swim against them to see where we are.”
Beginning on Wednesday night, the men’s swim team fielded a team of sophomore Levente Bathory, freshman Andrew Acosta, junior Raphael Marcoux, and junior Zach Snyder in the 800-yard freestyle relay. Placing 11th with a time of 6:40.89, Harvard competed in the event for the first time this season.
Thursday opened up with with final qualifying times in the 500-yard freestyle posted by senior Brennan Novak, Snyder, and senior Gavin Springer. With times of 4:19.11, 4:26.36, and 4:29.23, respectively, all three swimmers notched season-best times.
In the 200-yard individual medley, Harvard had junior Daniel Chang and senior Daniel Tran both qualify for the finals. In the championships rounds, Chang defeated the surrounding competition in the C-final with a season-best time of 1:46.66, thus qualifying for the NCAA B Standard. Tran finished the D-Final in 1:49.43 which gave him a third place finish among the eight racers.
Closing Thursday’s opening session, junior Dean Farris notched the third fastest time in the preliminary rounds of the 50 freestyle at 19.49. This was the first time this season that a Harvard swimmer broke 20 seconds in the event.
The night ended with a series of relays, with the quartet of Farris, Marcoux, Goddard, and sophomore Mahlon Reihman coming in at fifth with a time of 1:19.80 in the 200 freestyle relay. Shortly after was the 400 medley relay in which Farris, Chang, Marcoux, and Reihman finished seventh with a time of 3:10.38.
On Friday, Farris qualified for two NCAA B Standards in the 200 free with a season best time of 1:33.53 and a first place finish in the 100 back with a time of 45.26. Now, the Atlanta native holds the top three times in the 100 back in program history.
Daniel Chang followed in Farris’ footsteps with an additional B Standard qualification in the 400 yard individual medley, posting a time of 3:51.56. The men’s team meet ended with both Novak and Snyder putting up NCAA B Standard qualifying times of 15:02.72 and 15:23.99, respectively, in the 1,650 yard freestyle on Saturday.
“We had a really strong showing,” Goddard commented. “Usually when we go to Texas, a lot of the guys go to pick up their NCAA cuts to qualify for the NCAA championships in March. I was really impressed with what we did out there — a lot of the times that guys were getting were top times in the Ivy Leagues.”
In Athens, Georgia, the men’s dive team had sophomore Alec DeCaprio earning a season-best and NCAA Qualifying Standard 307.10 points to come in sixth place in the 1-meter board. Sophomore Hal Watts followed in eighth with 271.30 points. The next day, Watts was Harvard’s top performer, finishing seventh in the 3-meter board with 301.85 points.
For the women’s swim team, the Harvard quartet of senior Sonia Wang, freshman Samantha Shelton, freshman Helena Moreno, and junior Miki Dahlke finished in seventh place with a time of 7:09.84 in the 800-yard freestyle relay. Foursomes of senior Meagan Popp, freshman Mikki Thompson, sophomore Michelle Owens, and senior Claire Pinson and senior Brittany Usinger, junior Matti Harrison, freshman Liz Boyer, and senior Valerie Yoshimura finished the night with times of 7:20.11 and 7:23.97, respectively.
“The freshmen are swimming amazingly,” said tri-captain Meagan Popp. “It’s really good seeing our freshman adapting to the college system and really thriving.”
On Thursday, Dahlke came in second place of the B-final of the 500-yard freestyle with a NCAA Qualifying B Standard time of 4:45.45. Meanwhile, Wang recorded Harvard’s top time in the 200 individual medley with a B standard time and third place finish of 1:59.19.
The night ended with the quartet of Dahlke, junior Mei Lynn Colby, Shelton, and sophomore Ingrid Wall producing a season best time of 1:32.36 in the 200 free relay and the quartet of Harrison, sophomore Jaycee Yegher, sophomore Cassandra Pasadyn, and Pinson posting a 3:49.17 finish in the 400 medley relay.
On Friday, Dahlke posted Harvard’s fastest time of the year in the 100 yard butterfly with a B Standard time of 53.64. Shelton duplicated this in the 200 freestyle with a 1:46.45. In the finals later that night, Shelton posted the eighth fastest time in the event and Dahlke came in fourth in the B-final.
On the final day, Shelton, the Texas native, posted Harvard’s first sub two minute in the 200 yard backstroke with a time of 1:54.98. Both Yagher and Popp placed in the A final of the 200 breaststroke with times of 2:13.85 and 2:16.19, respectively. Two other swimmers posted B Standard times on Saturday, with Dahlke finishing the 100 freestyle in 49.01 and Usinger posting a 1:58.04 in the 200 butterfly.
“We had some really good swims,” says Popp. “For us, this meet was more of a practice meet preparing us for the Ivies that will come later in the season. Right now, people were working on their techniques in their strokes and it was just really inspiring to see all the fast swims.”
In Athens, senior Mikaela Thompson finished in third place in a season best effort of 290.50 in the 3-meter diving event. Harvard had two other divers place in the top 10, with freshman Esther Lawrence placing fifth with 264.80 and sophomore Georgina Milne in ninth with 249.75. In the 1-meter dive, Lawrence came in fifth place with 270.95, Thompson in eighth with 24.80, and Milne in ninth with 268.00.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rolling off a 2-0 win against Rensselaer on Friday night, the Crimson (4-5-1, 3-3-1 ECAC) returned back to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center to take on the Union Dutchwomen (2-12-2, 0-5-1). Harvard came out on top with a 4-0 victory, completing its weekend sweep.
Early in the second period, with the game still tied at zero, sophomore defender Emma Buckles rushed forward and intercepted a Union pass. Speeding towards the Dutchwomen net, Buckles unleashed a deadly drag shot, which flew by the Union goalie and slammed into the net.
“We had a lot of opportunities and pucks were not going in,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “When Emma Buckles scored, it was a sigh of relief. We started to play a little more relaxed and settle into our game.”
The next three goals scored by Harvard would fall late into the third period, starting with freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere.
Taking advantage of a two on one opportunity, Della Rovere and Hughes outflanked the sole Union defender and raced towards the Union net. Near the goal, Hughes took a swift shot which bounced off the goalie. Moments later, Della Rovere appeared next to the goal and redirected the rebound which hit the top corner, doubling Harvard’s lead.
Harvard’s third goal would come twenty-nine seconds later, thanks to a tag team effort by freshman forward Anne Bloomer and sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich. Near the Union goal, Jovanovich shot a pass towards Bloomer who capitalized on the shot opportunity and streaked the puck past the Dutchwomen goalkeeper.
Just eighteen seconds after Bloomer’s goal, sophomore forward Keely Moy provided the Crimson’s final goal.
“Every line contributed and every line scored back to back,” senior forward Bradley Fusco said. “We just kept building off each other and it was a three line effort.”
The Crimson controlled the game’s offensive pace, winning thirty-five faceoffs and registering thirty-four shots on goal.
Harvard not only dominated offensively but defensively as well. Leading the efforts was freshman goalie Lindsay Reed.
“Lindsay has been unbelievable this year,” captain and senior forward Kate Hallett said. “She continues to develop her game and as a leader, on and off the ice, she has been unbelievable.”
Reed, coming off a strong performance against Rensselaer, recorded another shutout game, with a total of thirty-four saves.
“She came out with two shutouts in a row,” Hughes said. “That was really rewarding for all the work she has put in. It was nice to see her get that accomplishment and help the team out.”
Saturday’s game contained a number of key performances from freshmen players, including Lindsay Reed, Kristine Della Rovere, and Anne Bloomer, signaling the level of depth and talent present on the Harvard team.
“It has been really fun to watch them from week one until now,” Hallett said. “The college level it is so different, it is a lot faster and they all have developed really into that. Every single one of them comes ready to play and ready to go come game time.”
Completing its weekend sweep with back to back victories, the Crimson look to carry that momentum into the last two games of the semester. They face the Maine Black Bears at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Dec. 7, and the New Hampshire Wildcats at Durham, N.H. on Dec. 8.
“We only have these two games left in the semester,” Hallett said. “The goal is to win those games and finish on a high note was we enter the break and continue to train really hard to prepare ourselves for the second half of the season.”

Walking through campus you may hear some people talking about “winternships” — the strange time over winter break when some people choose to work instead of relax. But let’s face it, winter break is for taking a much needed mental break and catching up on Netflix (and non-HUDS calories), not for overloading yourself so as to only come back just as stressed as you left.
Do Some Ec10
Before you start considering the prospects of working over winter break, take a moment to do a cost benefit analysis, weighing the benefits of relaxation with the short-lived internship that most likely will not be a fulfilling experience. Just think, would you rather be sipping some hot cocoa and sleeping in, or spending a few weeks continuing the stress that you experienced during all of the fall semester?
Know Yourself, Love Yourself
While some may want to try something new with their internship, or hope to add another few lines to their resume, don’t be tempted to pursue this opportunity just for the sake of following the rest of the crowd. You do you. Recognizing that you need some alone time or some time away from anything remotely related to school is not a bad thing. Just think, after a month at home, you can come back refreshed and ready to take on the spring.
Home. Cooked. Food.
Would you rather be toiling away in a boring office in Boston and living on ramen from your microfridge or eating all the delicious snacks your family makes? Need we say more?
All in all, make the right choice for you. Sure, you can work at a startup or continue conducting research, but keep in mind the benefits of the time you can spend recharging this break. Say no to winternships and end this tragedy before it begins.
