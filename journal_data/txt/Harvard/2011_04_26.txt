After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A cheetah, a lioness, and your mom might have more in common than you think—or so suggests DisneyNature’s latest endeavor, “African Cats.” An anthropomorphizing wildlife documentary from Disney’s nature film division, the movie is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and takes viewers through two and a half years in the lives of two lion prides and a family of cheetahs. Though “African Cats” boasts stunning visuals, it has little else to recommend it.
The lions of the River Pride live in the hills south of the Mara River in Kenya. The pride boasts a horde of lionesses, including protagonist Mara, a young cub whose elderly mother Layla is on her last legs. Fang is the male of the pride and charged with protecting the females and their cubs. But just north of the river lives Kali, a powerful lion with four strong sons and a goal to expand his territory. Caught in the middle is Sita the cheetah, a ‘single mom’ trying to raise her five new cubs to adulthood. With all these feisty felines fighting for survival, what happens next is anybody’s guess.
As befitting a nature film, the visuals of “African Cats” do not disappoint. In press accounts, co-director Alastair Fothergill has attributed the panoramic beauty of the film to the talents of camera operators Owen Newman, Simon King and Sophie Darlington. They used the cutting-edge Phantom high-speed camera to shoot the film’s eponymous cats at 450 frames per second. The results—hypnotic sequences that showcase every hair and muscle of the majestic animals as they play, rest, hunt, and do everything in between—are truly captivating.
But once audiences nestle into the luxury of the beautiful imagery, “African Cats” starts to drag. Too much of the 90-minute narrative consists of slow-moving stand-offs with little payoff. Even the initially exciting hunting sequences start to look monotonously similar about halfway through the film’s runtime.
A few mesmerizing sequences stand out above the rest. At one point, Fang faces off with a crocodile. The two beasts roar at each other, snouts inches apart in a grippingly tense encounter. Later, during a thunderstorm, lightning illuminates the sky as Sita and her cubs sit shivering and drenched; the high-resolution image of such majestic creatures in a pathetically vulnerable state is startlingly affecting.
But unfortunately, sequences like these are few and far between. With so much time on their hands, audiences cannot help but fixate on Jackson’s over-the-top, never-ending narration. His inflated storytelling, combined with an overly dramatic score complete with choral passages and sound effects like artificially intensified heartbeats, exposes the documentary’s desperate attempts to infuse its images with drama. Eventually, the film starts to border on soap opera; its conceits detract from the power of the visuals themselves.
Along the same lines, the film’s uncredited storywriters’ attempts to impose a theme onto this exhibition of nature are distracting and inauthentic. In a forced statement about the all-conquering bonds of motherhood, Layla’s efforts to protect Mara are constantly paralleled with Sita’s attempts to protect her cubs. Grand, sweeping pronouncements like “there is nothing better for a lion than close companionship” and “there is no greater bond than that between a lioness and her cub” inspire skepticism about the film’s claim to scientific accuracy.
Beyond this, the film suffers from an uneven editing structure which confuses its message. The film repeatedly claims to be about the bonds of family, but the storylines on screen fail to maintain such consistency. “African Cats” cannot seem to decide whether it is about motherhood or about Kali’s takeover and its consequences for both cheetahs and lions. It also can’t seem to decide whether to be a scientific documentary or a narrative drama; it reaches for the best of both worlds and narrowly misses success in both.
All in all, “African Cats” may have been better off as a 30-minute IMAX film to be displayed in science museums instead of being inflated into a dragging full-length feature that desperately reaches for an elusive theme. Still, animal lovers of all ages can revel in the beauty of its imagery. Indeed, for those who walk into theaters expecting to take the images at face value, the film could definitely be an enjoyable experience. Critical consumers of documentary film, however, should probably look elsewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I frequently have the urge to hug random [Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC)] members when I pass them,” says Elizabeth J. Krane ’11. Given the love that the Harvard theater community has for Krane, winner of the Louise Donovan Award for behind-the-scenes contributions in theater, these hugs are likely less awkward than they sound.
“She’s just done so much, so well, and she’s built up such a good reputation for herself. Everyone in Harvard theater trusts her implicitly,” says Ali R. Leskowitz ’11, a friend and coworker and a Crimson arts editor.
Even listing her accomplishments is a tiring task. Formerly the President of the HRDC, Krane now works for the Office for the Arts, sings in the Holden Choir, and has been involved in over 30 different productions in roles ranging from producer to set designer to choreographer.
The legacy she will leave is not just of numerous producing credits or phenomenal shows, but of helping to forge a sense community within the HRDC. “Since it’s all different shows, we’re not really cohesive as an organization,” Krane says. “But one of my proudest moments was opening night of ‘The Balcony,’ because we really had the entire theater community come together for the Mainstage opening.” Another proud moment was the first annual HRDC pre-Housing Day River Run, which was just as integral in helping create the sense of community within the organization.
Before she entered Harvard, though, Krane was primarily interested in the acting side of theater. “I never would have expected myself to be involved in [behind-the-scenes roles],” says Krane. Since stage managing “Tick, Tick ... Boom!” her freshman year, though, she hasn’t looked back.
Her varied roles in a multitude of productions underlie her dependable reputation. “I’m sure if you ask anyone in the theater community who the most respected person is, it would definitely have to be Liz,” Leskowitz says. Fellow theater veteran Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 concurs. “She’s one that people fight over to work with every single semester because she is so ridiculously competent, and she makes life so much easier,” he said.
For Krane’s part, she enjoys staying behind the scenes. “I have learned so much about how to support other people’s creativity,” says Krane. Another benefit of the supporting role is that it allows her to step back and observe every step of a successful production. She tries to help share everything the cast and staff bring to the table with the audience. “As soon as you have a cast of enthusiastic people come together, that enthusiasm stretches to not only the cast but also to any audience member, and the relationship is real and magical in the end,” says Krane.
Krane will be taking the show on the road next year to New York City, where she hopes to work in theater administration. Reflecting on her experience, she has trouble picking out a favorite moment.  Two incidents of very different natures have stayed with her. The first is the opening of “Nine,” on which she earned her first producing credit. The second is a trip to a faraway junkyard looking for materials for a show. As this trek demonstrates, Krane does not just focus on her own work; she enjoys contributing to and improving everybody’s shows. “I love being the resource and making sure Harvard theater happens,” she says.

The phrase ‘triple threat’ is commonly used to describe skilled and versatile athletes. Kyle J. Dancewicz ’11 may not be a football player, but—according to friend and artistic collaborator Brandon J. Ortiz ’12—he is a ‘triple threat’ in a different sense: he excels in singing, acting, and dancing. Dancewicz, a member of the  Hasty Pudding Theatricals, has had a prolific performance career at Harvard in all three mediums.
Dancewicz developed an interest in theater in elementary school, and throughout high school he was involved in “four or five productions a year,” he says. Theater was an integral part of his life when he arrived at Harvard, and he immediately dove into the community, becoming involved in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and performing in the musical “Sweeney Todd.” He also joined the a cappella group the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones. “The transition to college was really easy,” Dancewicz said. “I was doing the same thing as in high school.”
However, Dancewicz’s arts career took a turn when he joined the Hasty Pudding in his sophomore year. In his first Pudding performance, “HPT 161: Acropolis Now,” Dancewicz donned a phoenix outfit, complete with a showgirl leotard, yellow tights, and four-inch heels. “It was never an uncomfortable thing for me except that it was extremely painful and sweaty,” Dancewicz said. Dancewicz soon thrived in the Pudding’s collaborative environment.
This year, Dancewicz served as the Cast Vice President of “HPT 163: Kashmir If You Can.” He ran the script comp in the summer, cast for the show in the fall, and helped bring the production to fruition on stage. Dancewicz had to deal with a large cast turnover—nine of the 12 cast members from the previous year’s show had graduated—and Dancewicz had the task of choosing their replacements. Dancewicz considers his involvement in casting a defining moment in his career. “It was amazing to see freshmen getting cast and knowing that I had a part in making it continue after I put so much effort into the organization,” Dancewicz said.
Dancewicz has developed a strong rapport with the newer members of the Pudding. “He was so welcoming and absolutely approachable,” Ortiz said. “He is very much the art patriarch for a lot of the younger generation.”
Besides performance, Dancewicz holds a deep interest in other arts. He is a member of the Signet Society and is a history of art and architecture concentrator.  “Kyle is conversant in every form of art,” Ortiz said. Dancewicz will remain in the arts world after college—he is interning at the Whitney Musuem of American Art this summer, and will work at Sotheby’s Auction House. As he advances into the art world, he will continue to be supported by the many peers he has inspired along the way. Pudding and Signet compatriot Ryan P. Halprin ’12 says, “I hope he continues to work on his performance craft, because it would be a terrible thing to waste.”

April 29-May 4, 7:30pm
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by William A. Grace ’12
Produced by Elizabeth J. Krane ’11 and Eleanor T. Regan ’13
Any production of Peter Shaffer’s “Equus” is bound to elicit a strong reaction from the audience. The acts of raw violence and sensuality become just as significant to the play as its themes on the search for personal meaning, identity, and faith. “It’s very scary if you can’t see through to the humanity in it,” says director William A. Grace ’12. “It can be very hard to see the goodness.”
“Equus” centers on a psychiatrist, Dysart (Alex P. Raymond ’12), during his sessions with Alan (Bryce D. Kauder ’14), a 17-year-old boy who has recently blinded six horses in what appears to be a bizarre fit of passion. As he attempts to reach Alan and mend his emotional scars, Dysart begins to doubt the value of his work, as well as his own notions of what it means to be normal.
While the cast will perform in the round and mostly without props, Grace will complement the physical and emotional intensity of the story with original choreography, co-created with Ilinca Radulian ’11. “Bill is extraordinary at taking something very specific, something that would normally be impossible to portray on stage, like sex, or riding a horse, and using choreography to present something that is very easily interpretable,” says Kauder.
The rights for “Equus” stipulate that Alan appear nude in the play’s final scenes and many past productions have used at least some form of stylized movement. “Key moments are often choreographed,” says Valériya Tsitron ’14, who plays would-be love interest Jill. “It makes it less awkward for the actors and at the same time more interesting for the audience.” While the play necessarily involves an element of spectacle, Grace says that he in no way intends his show to be gratuitous.  For Grace and members of the cast, dance and nudity are used very purposefully in the show.
Tsitron says that the show touches on many different topics, such as religion, growing up, and self-doubt. According to Grace, these topics make the play relatable. “For me this show is about what it means to have faith and to believe in something or someone,” he says. “There’s this whole undercurrent with the play and its characters of trying to find meaning in their lives.”

Walk into the doors for “Cleansed,” and you’re assaulted: glaring white lights blind you, and disturbing music throbs in the background. Caution tape ropes off the Loeb Drama Center Mainstage’s eerily bare seating, and you are forced backstage. In front of you lie a chain-link fence surrounded by exposed piping and brick, a black wall stained with clawing handprints, and a gaping, water-filled hole that spans the entire mud-strewn stage.  Already, director Matthew C. Stone ’11 has set the unnerving tone that will carry the play, and already it has defied expectations.
To describe “Cleansed”—which runs until April 30 on the Loeb Mainstage—as a play about love in the face of brutality does not do it justice. It tackles many themes that are too often dealt with superficially: human nature, the triumph and failures of love, brutality, terror. The treatment of these in “Cleansed” is anything but superficial. Rather, the play focuses on them so intimately it pushes past the point of discomfort and into the realm of pain. While such a tense, emotional atmosphere could feel overdone or monotonous, exceedingly skillful direction and impressive acting make “Cleansed” an indubitable success.
“Cleansed” takes place in a university reminiscent of a concentration camp. The sadistic Tinker (Stewart N. Kramer ’12) reigns over the ‘dysfunctional’—homosexual lovers Rod (Brandon J. Ortiz ’12) and Carl (Dan J. Giles ’13), suicidal Robin (an absolute standout performance by Joe G. Hodgkin ’12), and incestuous Grace (Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13) and her deceased brother and former lover Graham (Benjamin J. Lorenz ’14)—and ‘treats’ them through rape, torture, and brutality. It is against this background that playwright Sarah Kane explores love and human nature.
Though the acting feels a bit forced at the outset, sound (Stone), lighting (Bethina Liu ’13 and Lora D. Stoianova ’13), and set design (Snoweria Zhang ’12) combine to create an apprehensive tone that the cast later carry brilliantly. Lighting design continues to stand out throughout the show, as Liu and Stoianova aptly amplify subtle mood changes. In the closing scene, Carl extends his arm to Grace, who takes it in her hand. This slight movement could possibly be overlooked, and yet carries great significance in the play. In exchanging a harsh blue for a warm red light, Liu and Stoianova ensure that this seemingly incidental act creates a conspicuous shift in mood.
“Cleansed” contains several scenes in which all aspects of the play come together for remarkably powerful effect. In one such moment, Tinker forces Robin to eat an entire box of chocolates in a span of minutes. Hodgkin’s physical mannerisms are brilliant. Cowering on a bed and leaning as far away from Tinker as possible, he exudes timidity and fear. As Tinker violently throws each chocolate in front of him, Robin takes them, shoving each in his mouth and chewing with animalistic desperation. Though his interpretation sometimes misses Tinker’s psychological complexity, Kramer masters his character at the end of this scene. He stands on the bed looking down at Robin, hips cocked, body erect, head high, his very posture reinforcing his ability to ruin lives and his lack of feeling towards those he destroys.
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of producing “Cleansed” is rendering horrific emotional and physical trauma on stage, an aspect in which this production succeeds with remarkable maturity and affective force. Though successful throughout the play, Feinberg’s best moment was a scene in which Grace is beaten and raped by an unseen man. As the sounds of the beatings play, her body convulses with imaginary blows, and she lets out emotive screams and groans. While Grace is being raped, Feinberg confronts the audience, her face incredibly expressive and her body moving jerkily. Though the scene is long and deeply discomfiting, Feinberg’s chilling rendition of Grace demands full attention to the misdeeds that befall her character and lends the scene incredible power.
While the acting is superb, the direction in “Cleansed” is the key to its success. The play is a series of 20 scenes, all in rapid succession, and all of which cover brutal or intense material. Done poorly, this could get repetitive. Done with mediocrity, it could be overwhelming. However, done well, the play can be incredibly wrenching. And so it is. Rather than bombarding the audience with a succession of atrocities simply for the sake of showing brutality, everything is purposeful, and nothing seems superfluous. There are two rape scenes, multiple amputation scenes, two beating scenes, and three death scenes, and yet none of these feels like any of the others. Stone creates such emotion and suspense that, rather than numbing by repetition, each scene has a unique effect. In one of the death scenes, Robin hangs himself. Stone first builds up tension, as Robin calls Grace’s name more and more desperately. Then, he ends the scene with such a vivid, horrifying image by allowing Robin’s body to sway uninhibited for a few moments that the scene cannot be ignored. Never—from the moment the audience walks in to the theater to the curtain call—is the audience permitted to rest.
“Does it hurt? Do you want me to stop?” Tinker asks his partner during sex. Stone never asks these questions as he bombards the audience with scene after painful scene. It hurts. We want it to stop. And yet, in the end, it is this insistence to maintain the intensity that makes the play so powerful and successful.

Radcliffe Yard Sunken Garden
Directed by Tony J. Sterle ’11
Produced by Gus T. Hickey ’11
Though the story of “The Princess and the Pea” has been retold countless times, this may be the first time one of the princesses is played by a man in drag. This May, Sunken Garden Children’s Theater, a group of 14 undergraduates, will perform a spoof of a classic fairytale for the 17th year in Radcliffe Yard’s sunken garden.
“It’s kind of like [the TV show] ‘Spongebob Squarepants.’ It’s for kids, but little jokes are thrown in here and there for adults,” says Ryan P. Halprin ’12, who plays the Pea. Though the show is primarily aimed at children, Sunken Garden Children’s Theater entertains children and parents alike, explains co-president Gus T. Hickey ’11, also the writer and producer of this retelling. “As soon as you see it, it’s a trope. Everyone knows what happens. The only way for it to be interesting for the actors as well is for it to be funny for everyone. Otherwise, no one would want to do it. And the kids get more than we give them credit for,” says Hickey.
The generally high quality of performances in the Sunken Garden Children’s Theater is due in no small part to its flexibility.  Once undergraduates make it into the cast, they typically perform in the show during their remaining years at Harvard, which is made possible by the organization’s light rehearsal schedule. “It’s been conducive to drawing a really talented cast of people,” says co-president and director Tony J. Sterle ’11. “That makes it fun for us, as directors, to play with all these people who are so quick to grasp the material and the comedy.” Both co-presidents have performed in the show since their freshman years, and note nostalgically that Sunken Garden Children’s Theater has been one of the few constants for them during their undergraduate careers.
Sunken Garden Children’s Theater is also uniquely tied to the greater Cambridge community. The atmosphere of the show, performed in the picturesque sunken garden, is particularly welcoming. Audience members typically bring blankets and sit on the ground.  After the show, the children get to meet their favorite characters. “It’s one of the most effective ways in which HRDC [Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club] reaches out to the Cambridge community, because the audience never consists of just students or university affiliates,” says Hickey.  “It’s one of the few things that makes me feel like I’m doing a piece of community service. It’s a great feeling to make kids laugh.”

Homemade costumes, original techno, and laughs abounded at The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers’ (THUD) spring show on April 23 in Lowell Lecture Hall. Though the venue was not filled to capacity, the energy in the room was high, as the musicians’ enthusiasm and creativity filled the space with the sights and sounds of a variety of different types of percussion. 
In line with classic THUD tradition, this concert has its own theme: “Robots.” “If you’re wondering why—we just like robots,” the directors joked in the introductions following the opening number.
THUD member Seungjun Kim ’13 stated that THUD often chooses its concert themes based on general ideas for the concert and specific ideas for pieces.“If we can find a few that are kind of related then we can pick a theme. If not we just kind of pick one and go for it and see what we get,” he said. Seungjun’s twin brother Seungsoo Kim ’13 explained the choice of the spring concert’s theme, saying, “This one mostly came about because [the] roommate [of Co-Music Director Noam Hassenfeld ’12] had these robot costumes [lying] around.” 
Seungsoo was referring to the costumes worn by various members of the group–full-bodied, red and silver, metallic robot suits–during and between various pieces. Both these costumes and the transitional skits between pieces added personality and humor to the show. However, as the performers were unwilling to sacrifice the quality of their music for the sake of the theme, the weight of the theme lied with these two aspects rather than with the music. As THUD member Ian Dunn ’14 pointed out, most songs in the program were only loosely robot-related.  The THUD priority is interesting music, he said. Rather than enforcing the theme and thereby limiting the style of music, THUD chose to maintain variety. “We’re all about having a little something for everyone.” 
A little something for everyone could definitely be found in the show. Performances ranged from STOMP-inspired body percussion to renditions of Bach on the xylophone, vibraphone, glockenspiel, and marimba to the classic THUD cups tradition, in which they create rhythm with their hands, the tabletop, and solo cups. 
The range of performance style goes hand-in-hand with the range of specialties within the group.  Most group members are competent in all forms of percussion–mallet, drumset, snare, body, etc.–but many specialize. THUD co-director Gene Yoo ’12 says, “I’m not really a fan of mallet percussion,” though he is a capable player. “I don’t deal so much with tonal music, I just deal with rhythmic stuff.”  Situations like these are not uncommon for incoming THUD members, and they are not a significant factor in the audition process.  “You just have to be somewhat competent in percussion … We just look for talent, and we also look at what kind of person you are, your character, your personality. That factors in a lot, actually. We try to keep the group dynamic very chill, very playful, casual.”
This casual and laid-back approach to group dynamic is not indicative of the ensemble’s work ethic. About two weeks before their concert, they start rehearsing much more frequently than their usual two-hour, weekly pratices.  Even when their rehearsal schedule intensifies, THUD members still find the work enjoyable. “We’re all here to do it for fun,”  Seungjun said.  “It’s not something we do to write on a resume.  Few of us are planning to go into music.  It’s really our hobby … And the type of music we play kind of embodies that.” Member Rachel Wagley ’11 concurs. “This has provided an outlet for me to just—hit stuff,” she joked while snapping, clapping, and doing some low-key body-percussion.
Twins Seungjun and Seungsoo similarly view THUD primarily as an enjoyable experience. “We’ve played percussion since middle school and it’s always been the fun thing for us to do,” Seungjun said. “Because as Asians, we played piano because our parents made us, but then we played percussion because we wanted to,” he joked.  “It’s just us enjoying ourselves and expressing ourselves, more than anything.” This enjoyment of expression resulted, for many THUD members, in a very fulfilling performance. As Seungjun exaplained, ”If we had fun … it was a good show.”

Though opera might not be as popular of an art form with undergraduates as film or theatre, it still draws notably talented singers to Harvard. A recipient of the Radcliffe Doris Cohen Levi Prize for talent, energy, and enthusiasm for musical theater, Bridget P. Haile ’11, combines her talent with humility and a strong work ethic, and has been an impressive force on the Harvard opera scene for several years.
Haile is a native of Columbus, Ohio, and she first began performing opera with a group called Opera Columbus. “I started doing stuff with them in middle school, and in the seventh grade I was in a production of ‘The Magic Flute,’” she says. Her passion for singing has not waned at all over the years, and she has done numerous shows at Harvard, including the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ “Iolanthe” and “The Sorcerer,” Harvard Radcliffe Summer Theatre’s production of “The Rocky Horror Show,” and, most recently, Dunster House Opera’s “Die Fledermaus.” She also sings in the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, a critically acclaimed mixed chorus for undergraduates, and the Harvard University Choir, Harvard’s only paid chorus, which also mixes both graduate and undergraduate students. 
Other students who have worked with Haile are impressed by her diligence and her magnetic personality. “Bridget is my favorite person to work with on campus,” says Sofia M. Selowsky ’12, who has worked with Haile in several productions. “She is a great singer and actress, and she makes you want to perform to the best of your ability.” Matthew C. Stone ’11, a Crimson arts editor who directed Haile in “Die Fledermaus” and “The Rocky Horror Show,” wrote in an email that Haile puts both time and effort into her roles.  “Bridget is an incredibly hard worker in every way,” he writes. “She’s always totally prepared and knows her music, lines, and blocking inside out.” Stone also notes Haile’s positive attitude. “She’s always incredibly pleasant in the rehearsal room, and she puts an incredible amount of thought and effort into her character work. She’s someone who brings a lot of spontaneity and life into the rehearsal process because she’s such a naturally fun, vibrant person.”
Though opera stars are often known to be divas, Haile breaks this stereotype. Her colleagues describe her as both hardworking and humble, and she takes inspiration from the artists around her. One of her favorite things about the Harvard opera scene is that it gives her an opportunity to meet other talented students. “The nice thing about Harvard is that you don’t just mingle with people who do what you do,” she says. “There is a lot of overlap between artistic communities.” She feels that opera exemplifies this overlap because demands a wide range of talents. According to Haile, this translates on campus into a collaboration between some of Harvard’s most talented artists. “For example, some of the musicians for Dunster House Opera are the best musicians at Harvard,” she says.
Opera might be Haile’s first passion, but it is by no means her only one. She is an English concentrator who is especially interested in poetry. “It’s really easy to pigeonhole yourself, but I’ve really tried to broaden my horizons” she says, crediting Harvard for helping her do so. “One thing I didn’t know I was into before I came here was poetry,” she says, before jokingly adding “although I’m no poet.” 
Haile plans to continue her opera career after graduation. Next year she will be entering a two-year graduate program at the New England Conservatory to study voice, and this summer she has tentative plans to travel to Salzburg to take part in a student repertory program connected with the Salzburg Festival. 
“Above all, I am an opera singer. This is how people will remember me,” said renowned singer Luciano Pavarotti. Unlike him, as Haile leaves Harvard, she may not only be remembered as an opera singer, but also as the hard-working and inspirational person that her colleagues describe her to be.

 Ryu Goto ’11 has toured the world, played in Carnegie Hall, and received accolades from some of classical music’s greatest figures, but he is still thrilled about his time playing with Harvard’s own Bach Society Orchestra (BachSoc). “I’m performing for people I know and care about, which is very different to going from city to city,” he says. “There’s a sense of intimacy … I’m showing them who I am.” It is this genuine pleasure in being part of the campus arts community as well as his immense talent that has made Goto one of the Harvard music scene’s most prominent individuals.
 Goto came to Harvard with an already impressive reputation. At age seven, he debuted as a violinist in the Pacific Music Festival playing Paganini’s “Violin Concerto No.1;” he went on to attend Juilliard’s Pre-College Division for two years. The decision not to go to a conservatory is one he says he has never regretted. “The atmosphere was just so intense,” he says. “It was quite closed-minded.” The environment at Harvard has been more suited to him: “I love the enriching nature of it … My mind has opened up.” This breadth of interest, which Goto believes he would not have acquired at a conservatory, seems to be a defining aspect of his character.
 In addition to being a violinist, he plays guitar in a band, and his other activities include karate—he has earned a black belt—and working on a start-up with a friend. He listens to a lot of popular music; he smiles ruefully when he admits that he can’t remember the last time he attended a classical concert. This even carries over into his choice of major, physics. “I’m under no illusions,” he says, “I’m not going to be a physicist. But I do it because I’m interested in it.”
 His abiding passion, however, has always been his music, as demonstrated by his association with BachSoc. He entered their annual concerto competition as a freshman, and in his sophomore year they featured him as a soloist. Goto has remained loyal to the group ever since, and has played with them frequently throughout his time at Harvard. “BachSoc has always been nice to me,” he says. “They’re formed entirely by the willpower and discipline of the students, and the quality of the output they produce is very special.” While Goto has enjoyed great individual success, fellow musicians say that he has been willing to step out of the spotlight when the occasion calls for it. As one of his colleagues Jacob Shack ’14 writes in an emailed statement, “he has insisted on playing second violin, giving others a chance to shine while providing a solid foundation in the middle register.”
 His enthusiasm for music in general is markedly obvious, especially when he talks about his favorite works, such as the violin concertos of Johannes Brahms. “You never go wrong with Brahms, all his pieces are amazing,” he says. When he talks about the composer pouring himself into his music, you can’t help but feel he devotes himself to his craft in a similar way. He is reluctant to say ‘yes’ when asked whether or not he considers himself to be an artist—“It’s always been so much a part of me I’ve never had to tell myself that.” His music making seems to be a product of pure passion and excitement rather than one driven by a lofty and abstract desire to ‘create art.’ As Shack writes, “His antics during rehearsal reveal how devoted he is to music as both an art form and a profession.”
 Despite this, Goto is unsure what the future holds. Although he has already enjoyed great success as a musician, he is careful about committing himself to it: “Making something into a profession is a little different from it being an interest,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dressed in a hoodie and reflective sunglasses, Avinaash Subramaniam ’14 takes the stage. “Umi and Kaiyang, sittin’ in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G.” This skit—put on by the Harvard Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia Association (SIAMA)—went on to enact a marriage between a Chinese man and a Malaysian girl. Though their parents doubted that two such different cultures could ever produce a viable match, love won out in the end. After all, as Kaiyang Huan ’14 put it, “We both love supporting [English soccer team] Manchester United. And we both love malong food. And we both love supporting Manchester United while eating malong food!”
The performance was one of eight featured at Harvard Southeast Asia Night, which took place in the Leverett Dining Hall on April 23. While the audience enjoyed a Southeast Asian dinner featuring dishes from almost all of the represented cultures—Filipino, Thai, Vietnamese, Singaporean, Indonesian, Malaysian, and Indian—student groups put on a variety of quirky performances designed both to showcase talent and to spread cultural awareness. Thuy-Dung Quan ’11, a performer in the Vietnamese dance troupe, said, “In Vietnam, at least, food is a very important part of socializing. We were going for the most authentic possible experience.” 
While Coke machines still lurked beneath the paper lanterns lining the walls of the dining hall, the determination of the dancers and performers to share a part of their backgrounds created an authentic environment. Before nearly every performance, students shared videos that they had put together about their organization and the country that they represented. The Harvard Philippine Forum Dance Troupe showed a video in which a student wore a t-shirt bearing a map of the Philippines.  “I’m from—there!” said one student laughingly poking him hard in the ribs while joining other students in pointing out their hometowns. The video went on to comment on Filipino history, including over 300 years of Spanish occupation followed by nearly 50 years of U.S. occupation. The dance that followed—performed in traditional dress atop wooden benches stacked higher and higher as the performance went on—was a fusion of several of the Philippines’ cultural influences.
Before the audience was served iced Vietnamese coffee, members of the Harvard Vietnamese Association (HVA) took the stage with a skit about a young Vietnamese farm boy who wants to be a pop star instead of “majoring in lychee with a minor in rice paddies.” HVA also ended the night with a performance—in silk tunics and angular grass hats—of a more modern Vietnamese dance. 
While Southeast Asia Night has been a Harvard tradition for several years, it evolves a little every time. According to one of the coordinators, Tho D. Nguyen ’13, the videos were a new addition this year. “We wanted to allow student groups to share something about their culture [on top of] the performance,” he said. Part of the goal of Southeast Asia Night is to defy the stereotype that Asian cultures are similar. “Usually, they get lumped together,” said Michael Truong ’13, adding that the night was created not just to celebrate the cultures, but also to showcase the individuality of each culture represented. 
Other pieces included an acrobatic performance by the Harvard Wushu club, a performance of a Filipino folk ballad accompanied by a guitar, and a matchmaking event, in which a Cabot House sophomore was asked to choose from three potential suitors after asking them a few tough questions: “What’s your idea of good date?” and “If I were an ice cream, how would you lick me?” 
Throughout the entire show, students shared their affection for their countries and one another with enthusiasm and good humor. Though many of the jokes required some knowledge of the language, the humor and joy of the participants were apparent even without the cultural context.

This Friday, April 29, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Center for Middle Eastern Studies will host “Islam, the Middle East, Muslim World,” a drop-in workshop where attendees can learn techniques for putting their own ideas into comic book panels. Located at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, the event is co-sponsored by the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies Outreach Center and the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program.
Krystina Friedlander, one of the co-organizers of the event and the Program Assistant at the Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program, wrote in an emailed statement that her desire to do this workshop grew out of a lifelong love of comic books. “We [co-organizer Anna Mudd and myself] thought about how great it would be to facilitate something creative that would allow the Harvard community to actually share their own experiences,” she wrote.
In the workshop, attendees will work with comic artists, learning to sift through their ideas and pick the most salient elements to transfer to the page. By learning how to make comics, they can create their own without any prior experience. In addition to creating art, attendees will learn about current comics and graphic novels that address Middle Eastern and Islamic issues. They will also learn about artistic techniques from comic artists currently working in the Middle East.
Friedlander hopes that this workshop will enable participants to share their own perspectives on the Middle East in a creative and non-judgmental outlet. “Storytelling can bring us into others’ lives in a really dynamic way,” she wrote. “I consider it one of the most important tools we have to address the current unease with Islam and the Middle East in the United States.”
Paul Beran, the director of the Outreach Center at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, believes that the event will attract a diverse range of people. He expects that many teachers will attend, especially those hoping to use comics and graphic novels to convey important messages in their classrooms.
The workshop grew out of two areas of study that the Outreach Center focused on last year. “The first is contemporary art from the Middle East region—we focused on graphic novels and comics,” Beran wrote in an emailed statement. “The second is Islamophobia, as we started the year with a campus-wide teach-in on the Muslim community center controversy in Manhattan.”
The workshop is accessible to anyone with an interest in comic books or the Middle East, as Beran also expects to see artistic Harvard students and members of the Muslim community in attendance. “It is designed to be an outreach style workshop,” he wrote. “The academic content and discussion is robust and open, to both students of the topic and attendees who may be new to it.” Throughout the event, he will highlight additional resources on campus and at the Outreach Center for attendees to explore after the workshop.
During this past the year, Beran has been facilitating on-campus workshops and book discussions, as well as compiling comics and graphic novels related to Middle Eastern issues. He is also assisting in a nearly complete collaborative effort to establish a resource center of Muslim comics, one that educators can use with children of all ages when discussing Islam and the Middle East. This upcoming workshop, Beran said, is the culmination of all the work his department has been doing over the past year.
“We also thought it would be great,” Friedlander said, “for participants to walk away with something they’ve made, and ideally to inspire them, and others, to experiment with different ways of telling stories about the Middle East and Islam.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Photographer Susan Meiselas has directed her lens toward everything from carnival strippers to a revolution in Nicaragua. In a lifelong body of work known both for its variation and its excellence, Meiselas consistently showcases what photographer Jim Harrison describes as an “ability to combine an artistic skill with the inquisitiveness of a good social scientist.”
It is precisely for her combination of artistry and sociological inquiry that Meiselas has been awarded the Harvard Arts Medal, which, according to the Office or the Arts (OFA), is presented annually to a Harvard graduate or faculty member who has “achieved excellence in the arts and has made a contribution through the arts to education or the public good.” Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust will present Meiselas with the Harvard Arts Medal in a ceremony that will take place this Friday at 4 p.m. in the New College Theater.
Meiselas will be adding the Harvard Arts Medal to a long list of honors she has garnered over the course of her career, among them the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1979 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992.
“Susan was selected for a variety of reasons,” wrote OFA director Jack Megan in an email. “The overriding consideration, of course, is the quality of her work, which has been recognized around the globe. But the committee also was impressed with the fact that she has used her talent to document extraordinary and historic moments—the images from Nicaragua, as well as the Kurdish struggles.”
John A. Lithgow ’67, who will be hosting Friday’s ceremony, wrote in an email to The Crimson that he was delighted about this year’s selection. “Susan and I share a lot of history and some very good friends, so I’m delighted that we’ll meet at Harvard under these circumstances. I’m proud to help celebrate her,” he said.
After attending Sarah Lawrence as an undergraduate, Susan Meiselas graduated from Harvard in 1971 with an M.A. in visual education. She made her debut in the world of photography with a series entitled “Carnival Strippers,” which illustrated the lives of strippers in New England who worked in carnivals. This project, which she completed over the course of three summers, was an early sign of the innovative sensibility and intellectual rigor that marks Meiselas’ art.
“‘Carnival Strippers’ probably influenced me more than anything because the way she approached it was so uncompromised,” said photographer Jim Harrison, a contributing editor at Harvard Magazine. “If you look at the book, it is extraordinarily raw and uncompromising.”
The body of work that catapulted Meiselas to fame, however, was her coverage of the Sandista Revolution in Nicaragua during the 1970s. In one iconic photograph, a woman in a striking red dress pushes a cart upon which the shrouded body of her dead husband is resting. “Her images from the Nicaraguan civil war are among the most courageous photos I’ve ever seen, on both sides of the lens,” Lithgow said.
Although Meiselas’ photos quickly found their way into newspapers and news outlets around the world, Meiselas did not set out for Nicaragua with the intention of reporting news. Rather, Harrison said, “That [project] grew out of finding herself in a situation that was happening in a very dynamic way.”
Rather, Harrison believes Meiselas’s work aspires to permanence. “News has a temporal basis,” he said. “She’s more of a social scientist; she’s more interested in the historical record.”
Meiselas demonstrated her approach to photography as a form of recording history with her decision to return to Nicaragua 10 years after her original photos were taken. There she made enlargements of her photographs from 10 years earlier and installed them on the sites where they were originally taken. She also interviewed the subjects of her photos for a video documentary, “Pictures from a Revolution.”
Nicaragua is not the only country in which Meiselas has documented political upheaval and social injustice, and she is a frequent collaborator with Human Rights Watch (HRW). In 2006, Meiselas traveled with HRW researcher Nisha Varia to document the migration of women in search of domestic work in Southeast Asia; in 2007, her photos were used in a report entitled “Bottom of the Ladder,” which focused on the exploitation of domestic workers in Guinea, where thousands of girls begin working when they are only nine years old. Last year, Meiselas collaborated with HRW on “In Silence,” a photo exhibit documenting the dangers of childbirth in India.
In one of her most historically conscious projects, Meiselas spent six years creating a visual history of the Kurdish people. To accompany her own pictures, she also collected hundreds of photographs and accounts from soldiers, journalists, and Kurdish families. These records are hosted on a website; people continue to contribute images and stories to her perpetually growing project.
Whether documenting human rights abuses alongside HRW or exploring the lives of workers in a Manhattan sex club—as she did in her piece “Pandora’s Box”—Meiselas unfailingly brings a balance of artistic vision and historical consciousness to her photographs. “One might argue that the documentary photographer snaps the image and there is no interpretive component. But that hardly seems reasonable,” wrote Megan. “The photographer, after all, chooses where to point the camera. In so doing, she is saying, ‘This is the action or the moment that I want you to pay attention to.’” Throughout her career, Meiselas has continuously made bold choices in her work; she has been a diligent recorder of human experience and called attention to struggles across the globe with a meticulous, compassionate eye.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard students accept that people they meet will assume they are introverted workaholics who stay in and study all night. Others, like Abel Acuna ’11, take action. Producer of the early viral video “Facebook.com Song” in high school—which today has nearly 700,000 hits on YouTube—Abel has filmed and starred in videos like “Harvard Bros” and “Four Broko” to combat popular perceptions of Harvard students. “A lot of my work at Harvard has been to kind of poke fun at the Harvard name, because when people think of Harvard they automatically think of nerdy kids who study all day,” he says. “I wanted to share a different perspective with my friends at home and people on YouTube.”
The government concentrator, however, appreciates the respect that the Harvard name garners in the outside world. When looking for an internship after his sophomore year, Acuna noticed that “a lot of these entertainment companies don’t see a lot of applicants from the Harvard and Ivy communities, so they do give us a second glance when looking at our resume or calling us for a phone interview.” Why the shortage of Ivy League applicants for entertainment industry jobs and internships? “Some of the qualities they’re looking for might not … come from a Harvard applicant,” Acuna says. “A lot of these opportunities—especially not the more creative ones—are a lot more clerical.” In Acuna’s case, the Harvard name and his own resume obviously paid off, because that summer he went on to work for Home Box Office (HBO), the creator of shows like “Entourage” and “True Blood.”
The summer internship marked a turning point for Acuna. “Being there, being involved in something creative, being involved in an industry that ... provides entertainment to people seemed a lot more satisfying than writing papers or anything like that,” he recalls.
That experience spurred Acuna to consider going into the entertainment business himself. “My videos had always been well received and I never tried transferring that to a career,” he says, “but after my summer in L.A., I saw that there was an industry for it and I decided to come back and really finish my requirements ... so that I could spend my entire senior year working on projects.” Those projects included creating a video production service for Harvard Student Agencies and working as the assistant director on Harvard University Television’s J-Term film. Acuna also earned a secondary in visual and environmental studies.
Although he has indulged his artistic side at Harvard, Acuna says, “I see myself going after college into the world of entrepreneurship. My plan is to after college help build a number of startups that I’m working on to gain some business skills, and then perhaps eventually move over to the entertainment side of things.”
In fact, Acuna’s work in the entrepreneurial and advertising realm has taught him much about the utility of film while allowing him to hone his craft. “On one side [video production] is a fundamental business task like advertising, but I like to add my own piece of creative touch to these things,” he says.
Acuna has been less involved with the film scene on Harvard’s campus, which he finds somewhat lacking, even as he stresses its steady improvement. “There haven’t been that many on-campus groups that really facilitate artistic growth in the realm of film or video. It’s something I think is being worked on now and will improve in the next few years,” Acuna says. “Now it’s really about finding groups of your own peers on campus and improving your skills with them.” He characterizes the Harvard film scene in words that easily describe his own budding career: “in development.”

Somerville native Kiley A. McLaughlin ’11 has spent the majority of her life in the Boston area. The familiarity that naturally arose from spending so much time locally has inspired her poetry. “When you are out of your own space,” she says, “you look at things differently, so I think that’s why a lot of my poems are about when I’m not here. When you’re home you take things for granted, and when you’re away your senses are heightened.” That heightened awareness has resulted in a poetic style characterized by breathless but precise detail and evocative portraits of moments in urban life. One of her poems, entitled “Brooklyn,” reads: “An expanse. A dulled scrawl of doors. Bricks beginning over cinderblocks slouch into crust. / Everything separating us from the ground.”
McLaughlin’s poetic career developed almost incidentally. She wrote throughout high school but only for herself, sharing her poetry only with her sister. Poetry is her means of externalizing emotions to which she could not otherwise give a voice. “If I could express the things I’m trying to express through poems in any other way,” she says, “then I wouldn’t have to write poems.” She is still reticent about her writing, but has published her work in Tuesday Magazine and will also appear in the upcoming edition of The Gamut, the College’s student poetry magazine.
After years of keeping her work secret, McLaughlin applied for a poetry writing workshop at Harvard as a sophomore. The class proved to be a catalyst for later developments. She initially declared a concentration in social anthropology, but during her junior fall switched to English in order to apply to write a creative thesis. She was accepted, and in March began a process of poetic transformation under the guidance of Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory Jorie Graham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. The end result was a compilation of approximately 40 poems entitled “Dust,” dealing with themes of mortality and impermanence.
The first thing that changed was McLaughlin’s form: Graham encouraged her to write in long, extended sentences, capturing and capitalizing on the ‘breathlessness’ that characterizes McLaughlin’s work. She also developed a poetic format similar to that of a glossary. The format allows her to explore the multiple meanings of common words and challenge the definition of poetry itself. Another piece of hers, “Glossary of Literary Terms,” reads: “dormant / 1. to be kept for later, as a prize 2. to be kept from the telephone 3. to be kept from the honky-tonks 4. to be kept from the windows on this side of the house 5. to be kept en mass, in a stadium of resistance 6. to be kept lying asleep or as if asleep 7. to be inoperative, in abeyance, but within throwing range 8. to be kept, and kept.”
This fall, McLaughlin applied to and was accepted to the poetry program at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop. “At the beginning of this year, I couldn’t see myself doing anything else,” she says. “I couldn’t see myself applying to a job. I really wanted to keep writing and see where it was going to take me.” After completing the program, McLaughlin hopes to either teach at a university or start a literature newsletter or magazine. Either way, poetry has become her primary focus, and her future plans revolve around her desire to continue to write.
Her innovation and unique poetic vision bode well for future endeavors. Joanna Klink, a member of the creative writing faculty and a reader of McLaughlin’s thesis, says that “her poems are visually intense, by turns haunted and beautiful. They are attentive to injustice and helplessness, to small unexpected pleasures, to degrees of dusk, to color—the way it, like all human things, hovers between meanings.”

For Literature concentrator and composer Oliver D. Strand ’11, academics and the arts do not merely overlap—they inform each other in unique and surprising ways. “Composers and poets use a lot of the same terminology but come at it from different angles,” Strand, a joint student at Harvard College and New England Conservatory, says. “We both have to think about rhythm and line and meters, a voice.” One of his composition teachers, Manuel Sosa, instilled in him the value of an interdisciplinary education. While citing musical influences such as composers Morton Feldman and John Cage, as well as musical genres like Motown and blues, Strand also claims that the two classes most influential to his composing were not in music but in poetry and sculpture.
An able pianist and violinist, Strand has chosen to have others perform his compositions at concerts because he finds it informative. “It’s a much different experience when you’re hearing it in the audience. When you’re writing, you’re also performing it at the same time, whether in your imagination or with an instrument.” Strand assesses the response to his pieces in a methodical manner that he learned from one of his prior teachers. “If the audience claps immediately when it’s over, it means the piece ended 10 seconds ago and they’ve just been waiting. But if it ends and there is a 30-second pause, it means they don’t know what’s going on. Somewhere between there, there is a moment for the audience to sit and consider what happened,” he says.
Despite having his compositions performed at the prestigious Juilliard School’s Morse Hall and the Salle Cortot at the École Normale de Musique in Paris, when asked about his concert experiences, Strand chooses to cite a compliment he received two winters ago. This compliment was not from a famous composer or musician but from a mother of one of his friends, who told him that the silences in his work seemed just as important as the sounds. “That was exactly what I was hoping someone might say to me one day. It was really surprising and wonderful to hear,” Strand says.
Strand, a recipient of a David Rockefeller International Experience Grant, has chosen what some might consider an unexpected plan: to travel to Japan and be an apprentice in woodworking. His reasoning illustrates his willingness to stray from the familiar. “Music and poetry are both art forms that exist very much in your head, and they’re very easy to change. But that isn’t true when working with wood. The material requirements force you to make your plans and revise your plans and then stop and take stock of what’s happening, revise your plans again, and there’s this constant dialogue between what the material is and what you want to cause it to do that is exciting and surprising, and feels like a wonderful experiment every time, ” says Strand.
Despite the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Strand is undeterred. Although he had to find a new organization with which to work, Strand will go as planned. After he returns from Japan, he hopes to finish his Master’s in composition at New England Conservatory. “My hope,” Strand says, “is that I’ll continue writing poetry and music. Those are the two things I want to do the most. It’s unclear to me how to not starve to death, but hopefully I will find a way to make that happen.”

“I knew that I wanted to write but I didn’t know in what capacity,” says Courtney G. Bowman ’11, recalling her time in high school. At Harvard, she found her comedic voice, first writing for and then becoming president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Outside of comedy, Bowman’s medium of choice is fiction. She has contributed to the Advocate, and she wrote a series of cyclical short stories for her creative English thesis. She cites “Olive Kitteridge” by Elizabeth Strout as a literary influence.
“In high school she was hilariously serious about poetry,” says her brother Johnny F. Bowman ’11. In college, that changed as her friends got into comedy and she followed suit. She became a writer for the Lampoon and developed a sense of humor that fellow Lampoon writer Benjamin U. Steiner ’11 finds highly original: “She always tries to write what no one else has written before,” he says. Bowman prioritizes this search for novelty in her comedy writing. “I feel like in humor it’s very important to break format. You always want to subvert the assumptions of your audience,” she says.
Her humor has also been well received outside of Harvard. She and Lampoon writing partner Cora F. Frazier ’11 published a parody of the popular teen novel “Twilight” entitled “Nightlight.” It became a New York Times bestseller.
At the intersection of Harvard and comedy—both notorious ‘boys’ clubs’—Bowman’s rise to the Lampoon presidency is a rare feat for a female student. She hopes that her success can positively influence other female writers on campus. “I feel very proud to have broken that glass ceiling,” she says. Steiner credits Bowman with the recent increase in female writers at the Lampoon: “She’s just very vocal and very present … People like to know that there are other girls in comedy when it’s not the first thing that comes to mind as to what they’d pursue.”
Despite her experiences with gender issues in comedy, Bowman has kept both her writing and her leadership at the Lampoon relatively ungendered. Steiner says, “sometimes you see girls trying to counteract the ‘boys’ club’ atmosphere by making girl comedy, [but] she just wants comedy to be comedy and not have a gender … She’s the kind of leader who would punch you in the face if you challenged her—metaphorically speaking.”
Yi Cai ’11, Bowman’s roommate and a fellow Lampoon member, highlights Bowman’s well-roundedness. “She is one of the funniest people I’ve met on campus ... [but also] a mentor for a lot of people outside of the activities she does, really involved in the house and community in general.” Cai emphasizes that Bowman is a strong supporter of Winthrop House intramurals.
As for the future, Bowman has yet to decide on her plans. She confides, with the kind of seriousness expected between a Lampoon writer and her Crimson interviewer, “I see myself going into business, maybe trying to run a start-up company, going, I don’t know, hopefully going the Goldman route.” Her Lampoon collaborator Steiner says, “I always say she’ll end up in L.A. writing for TV, but she insists she’ll be in a shack somewhere writing short stories.” He adds, knowingly, “who knows? Maybe she’ll end up on Wall Street.”

“Curious,” “commanding,” “surprising”—these are all adjectives used to describe the art of Dana M. Kase ’11, a Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) concentrator whose thesis this year has transformed mundane, household objects and furnishings art. Kase, a resident of Adams House, also served as president of the Harvard Advocate and studied abroad in London for a semester at Goldsmiths College in her junior year.
Friends of Kase paint a picture of a talented and scrupulous artist, always working on more than one project at a time. “Dana is meticulous,” says studio-mate Julia A. Rooney ’11, adding that “She’s never just working on one thing.” Rooney also emphasizes Kase’s execution in a variety of crafts. “She’s amazing on a technical level,” she says.
Kase says that immersing herself in the VES department was critical to her growth as an artist, though she did not plan on doing so when she arrived at Harvard. “I think that at the time, I wanted something academically rigorous, and didn’t know that VES could be that way for me,” she says.
Kase, who came to Harvard as a painter, says that it was through Harvard that her artwork evolved into the more sculptural and textile-based work of her thesis. “My first class with [VES Professor] Stephen Prina felt like a turning point for me. Things that I had always thought of as less serious and sort of peripheral to my art practice—crocheting, liberal glue-gun use, and so forth—started to become accessible to me as tools for my art,” she says.
Kase’s artistic talent is matched by her enthusiasm for the work and interest in the subject matter, which comes through in her pieces. “There is this really wonderful part of her artwork that you can sense when you look at it: that she is making work about things she is interested in,” says Isidore M.T. Bethel, Kase’s roommate, who met her during the Freshman Arts Program in 2007.
According to Bethel, part of Kase’s artistic brilliance comes from the process through which she creates her pieces. “There’s a very intuitive approach she has to her artwork,” he says. “She looks at and systematically challenges why she is interested in [her subject]—what the artistic merit there is to what she can do with that subject.”
Rooney, who said Kase works in what looks like a “laboratory,” believes that Kase’s method and talent yield uniquely amazing results. “It’s almost like a little sour and also a little sweet. There’s something very light about it; it’s not so serious about itself,” she says. “It comes away feeling very surprising and quirky about itself.” Rooney also respects Kase on a personal level. “Dana is phenomenal. All around, I would just say she’s just really, really great. Wonderful.”
As for the future, Kase does not know exactly where she’s going, but she thinks that arts will play a role and she has an idea for a few future projects. “I imagine that art will always be a part of my life,” she says. “I started to learn about chair caning last summer, so I have a few projects in mind involving furniture.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing day is an important moment for all Harvard freshmen, as they find out whether they will spend their next three years walking the distance to the quad or living amidst mice and roaches on the river. But for Katherine M. “Ty” Tygielski ’11, the day proved to be far more decisive than it was for most of her peers. It was not being placed in Mather House, however, that changed her life. Rather, it was her fortuitous discovery of the webcam on her MacBook.
“I was flabbergasted,” she says. “I turned this MacBook around, and carried it around Apley. I spent hours and hours shooting a film and editing it, and my next door neighbor came over and said, ‘you should just do a class and get credit for this.’ My housing day movie was my first film, and I was sold.”
Now a visual and environment studies (VES) concentrator, Tygielski has recently completed a senior thesis film entitled “The Shape of Things,” which documents the learning experience of kindergartners in a Nepali school for deaf children. But whether making an ad hoc film about housing day or working on her senior thesis across the Atlantic, Tygielski always maintains a sense of playful discovery in her work.
“I felt like the classroom was a playground for me as well as for [the kids],” Tygielski says. “Kids have this way of looking at the world that we’ve forgotten, and I wanted to capture that on film and to share it with the world.”
In her junior year, Tygielski took a semester off to live in Nepal, where she worked for three months in a school for deaf children and shot two short films. For her thesis, she returned to a different, larger deaf school in order to continue her exploration of South Asian deaf culture.
“It’s still considered taboo in a way to be deaf in Nepal. Parents don’t really make any effort to learn sign language,” says Tygielski, who has herself mastered Nepali signing. “When kids get to the school it’s really their first time learning language and communicating with other deaf kids. It’s a very unique opportunity to be able to capture this on film, and watch language developing, and actually seeing these kids being shaped by the world around them.”
Associate professor Lucien Castaing-Taylor’s course on Sensory Ethnography, which Tygielski took before leaving for Nepal, was extremely influential in shaping her approach to documentary film.  “I went into that class hating the long take; I didn’t want to sit through three minutes of one shot. But now I love it, and I can’t do the two-second shots anymore,” she says.
Alfred Guzetti and Amie Siegel are among the other VES professors whom Tygielski identifies as her greatest inspirations, though she is quick to express her love for the VES department in its entirety. “In documentary film, Harvard is the place to be. There are so many fantastic professors, and it’s a very supportive community,” she says.
But Harvard is not the only place where Tygielski has pursued her interest in filmmaking; in addition to her work in Nepal, she also spent a summer interning in New York City at In Motion Productions, a company that does work for Sesame Street and for other non-profit organizations.
This summer, Tygielski will be working as a videographer at the Acadia Summer Arts Program, an artist’s retreat in Bar Harbor, Maine, after which she hopes to go on a three-month yoga retreat. Beyond that, she may be interested in graduate school, though she is torn between film school, divinity school, and Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. Regardless of where she ends up, Tygielski is hoping to continue working in film. She is especially interested in exploring childhood, deafness, and what she describes as “the more meditative aspects of film.”
“Film and the arts can be such a playground, and such a great place to explore and experiment,” she says. “There are no rules. There’s no right and wrong. You just play.”

Immediate Gratification Players Coffeehouse
April 29, 6:30 p.m.
Cafe Gato Rojo
This weekend, the Immediate Gratification Players (IGP) will be adding a little humor to your coffee and topping your pastries with laughs during a coffeehouse event at Café Gato Rojo.
President Benjamin W.K. Smith ’12 explains how the event differs from the montage improvisation shows for which the group is known. “It’s going to be a lot more relaxed, people can sit and drink coffee while we perform some improv around them,” he says. “Traditionally it’s a dinner party, but this year we get to play characters in a different setting,” adds IGP member Graham H. Lazar ’12. “Last year we had a repressed stripper and a mystic, and it’s great to choose a character and see how it all plays out.”
Smith hopes audiences will engage with the performance, which will cater specifically to the 25 to 30 people who can squeeze into the small café. “[Whether] it’s a high schooler who’s come to visit Harvard or another student, anyone can get involved. It’s more like an open mic event than our usual shows,” says Smith.
Though the potential participation of spectators creates an additional element of spontaneity, the coffeehouse will not be strictly improvisational. “People should come because normally we make our stuff up on the spot,” says Lazar. “But for these events, we really do our homework and we come in prepared.” IGP member Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 explains the show’s format further. “We mix the spontaneity of improv, the story arc of sketch comedies, and the live vibe of stand-up.”
Despite the added structure in this event, the IGP will maintain its trademark levity. “It’s basically going to be really low-key and chill,” Lazar adds.

Making Art With Letters, Paper & Ink
April 30, 5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
Adams House Art Space
Though a book may seem like an endless stream of words on a page—especially when rushing to finish required reading—one freshman seminar knows better. Freshman Seminar 34z: “Making Art with Letters, Paper & Ink” has spent a full semester exploring the meaning behind individual words in written works. The course, taught by Zachary C. Sifuentes ’97, will present an exhibit that visually interpret words from various works of literature during this year’s Arts First festival.
The primary goal of the seminar is to devise creative interpretations of the language found in poems and books, and then to create artistic representations of these ideas. “It’s a class about the meaning of words,” said Matthew E. Warshauer ’14. “It’s about words that have more meaning than when you just read a sentence. Words have meaning in how they look, in how they’re printed, and in the way they’re arranged on the page.” The Arts First exhibit will feature projects from throughout the semester, including poems that have been transformed into drawings, and reproduced books in which passages are rearranged. For the final project, the class is creating ‘altered books’––books that are reconfigured to illustrate important aspects of the story.  Students were asked to select books of importance for the piece. “I chose to work with ‘Peter Pan’ for my main piece in the show,” says Madalyn S. Bates ’14. “I tried to convey the idea that there’s a lot more darkness to the Peter Pan story than we think, because there are a lot of nightmare scenes and darker motivations [in the text]. I took the words from the text, and wrote them over each other, which created art and depth and shading out of just the words themselves.”
Though the students are essentially putting together a visual art show, the course and the exhibit are predominantly rooted in language and words. Due to the literary element of the seminar, artistic skill is not as essential as deep understanding and creative interpretation of the literary texts.  “It’s really nice that the seminar emphasizes our creativity in a way that doesn’t require experience or extensive artistic talent,” said Jasmine M. Omeke ’14. “We just [work on] capturing the essence of texts in a creative way, and get a cool product out of that.” The course’s show will take place on Saturday in the Adams Art Space from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, the White House expressed regret for then-Senator Obama’s vote against increasing the level of the federal debt limit in 2006. Its remorse is well placed. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has warned Congress that it must raise the debt ceiling, a statutory limit on the amount of money the Treasury can borrow, from its current $14.3 trillion by mid-May to early July to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt payments. By threatening to forego a needed increase in the debt limit, Republicans, like Democrats during the Bush administration, are effectively holding the economy hostage to get what they want. Congress would do well to put an end to this kind of brinkmanship by eliminating the debt ceiling altogether.
The modern debt ceiling arose on the eve of World War II as a way to increase the Treasury’s flexibility in managing government finances. Since 1939 Congress has imposed an aggregate limit on debt issued by the Treasury, which applies to debt held by the public—individuals and foreign governments—as well as money borrowed from government accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. Since World War II, Congress has enacted nearly a hundred separate measures altering the debt ceiling, usually increasing it, and by a series of actions has raised the ceiling by almost $10 trillion since 1993.
While the limit is legally binding, it is not strictly necessary to the budgetary process. The Congressional Budget Office calls it an “ineffective means of controlling deficits,” since the decision to spend an amount that would require borrowing is “made through other legislative actions.” Congress creates the need for debt issuance by approving spending in excess of revenues. Once the debt level reaches the statutory ceiling, it is too late for Congress not to raise the limit without reneging on spending it has already approved or defaulting on outstanding debt.
Why, then, would we maintain what former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan calls a budgetary system akin to “suspenders and belts”? The usual explanation, articulated by the CBO, is that necessary increases in the ceiling “bring debt levels to the forefront of policy debate.” This is certainly true now, as House Republican leaders are demanding that the debt ceiling increase be accompanied by substantial long-term spending cuts. But given the political climate of the past two years, one wonders whether an obscure institutional mechanism was needed to get people to pay closer attention to the level of federal debt.
Against whatever benefits accrue from increased publicity for the national debt must be weighed the costs of political haggling over the debt ceiling. The trouble with threatening not to increase the debt limit when it is nearly even with the debt level is that there is no viable alternative. Suppose that in early July President Obama calls the Republicans’ bluff, foregoing the debt limit increase to avoid the spending reforms they demand. In that case the government has two options: Either cut off borrowing by immediately reducing total spending by 42 percent—the amount currently financed by loans—or refuse to repay creditors, either by simply not paying or by printing money and paying them in inflated dollars. Either course would have catastrophic macroeconomic consequences, and the latter would likely destroy the government’s ability to borrow.
Recognition of this reality would eventually lead to a compromise. The critical question, however, is how long this would take. The Treasury sells debt to individuals and governments in exchange for commitments to repay the debt with interest within a certain period of time. If Washington gridlock prevents a debt limit increase by the July 8 deadline, the Treasury could begin missing payments, resulting in higher interest rates on federal borrowing to compensate creditors for the greater perceived risk of lending to the Treasury. In addition to making the federal spending trajectory even less manageable, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke says a default would be a “recovery-ending event” because of the broader impact of higher interest rates and shattered confidence in the deadbeat government. Even if we never reach the point of default, there is bound to be uncertainty about the timeliness of Congress’s action to increase the debt ceiling, which could by itself increase the cost of federal borrowing.
The irony of all this, as the Washington Post’s Ezra Klein has pointed out, is that it is precisely this kind of debt crisis that GOP congressmen are trying to prevent by demanding budgetary reform in exchange for a debt limit increase. The dangerous fight we are about to experience, as well as previous instances of haggling over the debt ceiling, suggest that the statutory limit should not exist at all. Given the national mood, it may be necessary to couple its elimination with long-term debt reduction legislation, or to wait until the budget trajectory substantially improves. Until then, we can only hope partisan bickering does not provoke an imminently preventable budget crisis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seniors, assuming you acquit yourselves well during finals (I’d say odds are 50-50), almost a quarter of you will join me in New York, where I’ve been scratching out a living for about a year now. As you cogitate on your entrance into the real world, let me be the first to say, “Come on in! The water’s cold and unforgiving.”
Sobriety aside, I’m sorry to inform you that your diploma won’t give you the one thing necessary to survival: common sense. That, I’m afraid, you must earn. To make your segue as smooth as possible, however, here are a few pointers about life in the city—and in general:
First—unlike in class—at work, requirements are mandatory. If you’ve got a job, you’re expected to show up. You’re also expected to be on time. There’s none of this seven-minutes-past-the-hour funny business. Luckily, if you’re quick, you’ll realize that a 7 a.m. wake-up time isn’t so ungodly if you go to sleep the night before.
Second, work has unavoidable unpleasantries—namely, your coworkers. At one point, you may find yourself sitting across from a guy who went to Yale. And if the dude in the cubicle next to yours reeks because he came straight from the gym, you can’t sit somewhere else. There’s nowhere to go.
Third, work has rituals, which you must follow. To be a successful investment banker, for example, you’ve got to stare at your computer screen refreshing The New York Times homepage longer than the rest of your coworkers. The first one to leave loses.
Plus, you’ll need to learn the lingo. For instance, at an investment bank, you don’t “read” books; you “do” them—typically several in one night.
At the same time, you’ve got to have cojones: You’ve got to tell the boss “no” occasionally. Let’s practice: “No, boss, I can’t ‘do’ another book because I haven’t slept in the past 72 hours.” My I-banking friends tell me such a move would get them fired. I could think of worse things.
Fourth—and this trips people up a lot—at home, you have more work. There’s no such thing as Dorm Crew. Meaning: You have to clean the bathroom yourself. If you end up living with an economics major, he’ll try to pull a “comparative advantage” on you. “Brian,” he’ll say, as he pleads for chore time clemency, “this just isn’t a productive use of my time. These aren’t the skills I need to be learning right now.”
Now I’m as pro-market as Adam Smith, but you’ve got to set him straight: Twenty minutes of scrubbing the toilet is more edifying for him than another hour of listening to Rebecca Black. What will he learn? That he’s never too big for a job.
Some would say I’m mostly citing random anecdotes. And they’d be right. But my point is that the real world forces you to do things you dislike, things with almost no payoffs. And that is good.
College is a holiday from history, during which you have few real responsibilities—that is, the kind you can’t talk your way out of. After four years of it, you get to be a little spoiled. Because when you spend all our time thinking about mortgage-backed securities or the Arab Spring, you forget that eventually, you have to pay the rent. You start to think you don’t have time for the little things. You start to think you’re above them.
Thankfully, some real-world experience will teach you otherwise. No, it won’t teach you “what you want out of grad school.” (You already knew the answer to that: money.) Rather, it will teach you that life isn’t just about thinking big ideas and making big moves. It’s also about paying the bills and washing the dishes. It’s about being responsible for yourself and cognizant of others. It’s about humility.
A brief sojourn in reality land will show you that. You’ll start sticking to a schedule and maintaining a budget. You’ll become more likely to vote Republican. Or you’ll become a lawyer. Either way, it’s a good experience, and you’ll glean more practical knowledge than that contained by the entire Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology.
So cheer up, Harvard grads-to-be. You’re about to enter adult life. You’ve got brilliance down. Now give competence a try.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May 2009, Justin Cosby, a 21-year-old Cambridge resident, was shot to death in the basement of Kirkland House. But Cosby wasn’t fatally wounded by accident or in cold blood—he was shot after he refused to hand over a large sum of marijuana to Jabrai Jordan Copney, a New York City songwriter who has just been sentenced to life in prison without parole.
In that sense, Cosby’s death is perhaps the best illustration of what is truly dangerous about marijuana: The transaction surrounding its purchase, not the effects of its use. Although it just isn’t the case that students risk their lives every time they purchase marijuana, Cosby’s murder is nevertheless a reminder of the potential for violence in these illegal transactions. Therefore, the Kirkland shooting—in which that sort of violence went so far as to claim a life on Harvard’s own campus—is a clear reminder that the College—and, in a broader sense, the U.S. government—must do everything in their power to ensure the safety of the individuals they exist to protect.
Ultimately, ensuring that kind of safety means legalizing marijuana.
To be sure, there are other reasons the drug should be legalized besides the safety issue. Not only, for instance, are the alleged health risks of consuming marijuana less dangerous than those involved in consuming two legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco, the federal government wastes billions of taxpayer dollars every year in a futile prohibition of a drug that 89 percent of high school seniors still claimed was “fairly or very easy” to get. Also, for some, marijuana has a medicinal value, and there is no sufficient evidence that it is in any way a so-called “gateway drug.” A 2001 study by National Institute of Justice—a federal agency—even concluded that during the 1990s, a period of increased marijuana consumption among 18-20 year-olds, these young adults were not using the drug as a trial run for harder, more harmful drugs.
In light of Cosby’s murder, however, most important is the fact that approximately 80 million Americans have tried marijuana at some point in their lives. In other words, were the drug legalized and regulated as it is in the Netherlands, it would never have to change hands at gunpoint in the basement of a Harvard dormitory, and Justin Cosby—and countless others like him—might very well still be alive.
Of course, in the present political environment legalization is unlikely to occur soon. After all, just last year, California voters rejected Proposition 19—a ballot measure that would have made California the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use. In the meantime, local communities across the country must do everything within the current framework of the law to ensure the safety of all of their members.
In that sense, Cosby’s murder—and, now, Copney’s conviction—should serve as a reminder to the Harvard administration of what more it can do to protect its students from the dangers that will continue to exist so long as marijuana is illegal in the United States.
It is clear, for instance, that House Masters and tutors are well aware that marijuana use occurs in their Houses; they should show more oversight in monitoring their students who use marijuana. Additionally, since there is nothing to suggest that the circumstances around the Kirkland shooting could not be repeated, the College—in the immediate future—should more clearly and vocally state the penalties for distributing marijuana on campus so that if transactions do occur, they are at least made off campus. Also, Copney—the boyfriend of Brittany J. Smith, who was a Harvard senior at the time of the shooting—had been living unofficially with Smith in Lowell House for nearly a year. We urge the College to have stricter guest policies that would require guests to be registered, as many of our peer institutions do.
The Kirkland shooting trial saga looks set to continue, as in Massachusetts, all first-degree murder convictions incur an automatic appeal. As it progresses, we continue to realize that marijuana is a drug that kills, and that more than just health is at stake in its legalization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is with great joy that professors, students, and faculty welcomed the record number of women who declared computer science this year: 21 out of the 51 sophomore concentrators are female. Just last April, The Crimson reported that the concentration had the greatest gender imbalance at the College, with only 13 percent of undergraduate concentrators being female. While the ratio of women to men might indicate a growing interest in computer science among women or an elimination of the social stigma against women in the field, it is a far-from-perfect metric .
Harvard’s most popular introductory computer science course, Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science has proved wildly successful, largely thanks to the charisma and engaging methods of course instructor, David J. Malan ’99. By developing adaptive, interactive methods to introduce computer science—a stereotypically dry or incomprehensible subject to learn from scratch—to students with a wide spectrum of previous experience, Malan is often credited with showing undergraduates that computer science can be relevant, accessible, and cool. Perhaps this has contributed to the increase in female concentrators who may not have felt as comfortable delving into the concentration otherwise.
At the same time, female computer science concentrators who declare their sophomore year may well have been influenced by factors outside of the academic draw of the concentration, such as the CS50 Fair at the end of the semester, complete with popcorn, corporate sponsors, and stress balls. But although a class ethic and appealing light-hearted touches are appealing incentives, they are no substitute for a genuine attitude shift toward women in the sciences—one that acknowledges their abilities and respects their potential. This, more than concentration counts, is how we should measure the degree to which CS and other science fields are gender equitable.
The rise of women concentrators in computer science is thrilling because it indicates an expansion of fields where women dare trod now. However, female computer science participation at Harvard still has a long way to go. For example, while the gender ratio in the concentration hovers tantalizingly close to 50 percent among sophomores, the gender disparity in more advanced computer science courses like Computer Science 124: Data Systems and Algorithms remains enormous. Though the increase female computer science concentrators indicates an increase of role models for future classes, what does the dismal lack of such role modes in higher level computer science courses tell contemplative freshmen?
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has clearly made efforts to close this gender gap and promote computer science as a whole. While I fully support methods that earn the field a second glance—encouraging students but women in particular to consider computer science when societal notions and the lack of role models seem to suggest otherwise—we should make sure not to lose sight of this more intangible, more important goal of feeling respected as promising academics by their peers. To this end, although there is no comprehensive measure of how much gender equality has permeated the computer science concentration, we must look beyond the gender ratio: female participation rate in higher level classes and the careers females ultimately pursue after graduation are important signs. Until we cease to report these statistics at all to prove improvement, we march onward.
Or, to be more precise, we code onward.

Despite its popularity last season, the men’s basketball program has yet to formalize plans to continue chartering fan buses to and from select Ivy League road games.
The team offered these buses, as well as free admission, on two occasions earlier this year. New Haven played host to both: a regular-season game against Yale and the NCAA Tournament play-in game against Princeton.
Harvard lost both games, each by just a point, but the teams’ overall record spurred greater interest in the Crimson’s basketball team.
Despite the heightened enthusiasm, it remains unclear whether the student buses will be sponsored next year.
“It’s certainly not something we have budgeted for,” said Assistant Director of Athletics Kurt K. Svoboda. “But working with ... student agencies, the marketing office, and then with the basketball program itself, [we’re] trying to scratch out enough money to pay for the bus and back.”
As a result of last season’s success—the team won its first-ever share of the Ivy League title—fan interest in men’s basketball has grown, both on campus and nationally. In addition to multiple sellouts at Lavietes Pavilion this year, several Harvard contests were televised on ESPN networks.
“We had a pretty strong following with student fans in the last couple of years for basketball, and essentially, the department got approached by some students asking if we would consider doing a student bus,” Svoboda said.
Svoboda said that he did not know how specifically the buses were funded, nor did he know the costs associated with sponsoring buses and tickets this season. He also said that he was not certain to what degree donors were involved in funding the buses last season.
In addition to transportation, students who rode school-sponsored buses to the Feb. 26 Harvard-Yale game were also given free food and apparel.
Transportation to and from away games for major Harvard sporting events is not without precedent. When the annual Harvard-Yale football game is played on the road, buses are generally chartered for the thousands of students who go to New Haven for the event.
But buses to and from The Game are organized by Harvard Student Agencies and other student organizations, and students usually have to pay for transportation, meaning the Athletic Department is financially uninvolved—a fact Svoboda confirmed.
At the moment, no official decision has been made about fan buses for men’s basketball going into next season. Student transportation will be handled on a “case-by-case basis,” according to Svoboda.
Still, he said that the men’s basketball program does what it can to create a vibrant environment in conference play.
“I think we always hope to have a good atmosphere for those Ivy League games,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Freshmen Space Working Group recommended that the College renovate freshman common rooms and that Annenberg Dining Hall remain open for longer hours in a report intended to address freshmen’s concerns regarding the availability of social space.
Submitted Monday to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, the report suggests that certain freshman common rooms be reconfigured into specialized spaces like film-screening rooms, game rooms, and lounges.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said that he thinks the lack of use-specific common rooms can create a “tension” between students who use common rooms to socialize and those who use them to study.
“The current space doesn’t work because it serves multiple purposes and people get aggravated by multiple activities,” Dingman said.
Dingman pointed to the Wigglesworth common room as a space that could be used more effectively.
If the recommendations are approved, not all freshman common rooms would be renovated. According to Dingman, those that were recently upgraded—like the Matthews and Thayer common rooms—would likely not see any change.
The committee also suggested that Annenberg remain open longer, although Dingman said such a change could be cost-prohibitive.
Dingman added that the group is looking into on-campus spaces besides Annenberg that might be turned into additional social space for freshmen.
Led by Assistant Dean for Student Life David R. Friedrich, the working group—comprised of students and administrators—has spent the last few months evaluating social space in search of upgrades that would “improve the social experience,” Dingman said.
A survey conducted in December by the Freshman Dean’s Office revealed that a lack of social space is a primary concern among first year students.
UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said that if the committee’s recommendations are approved, he plans to help with the process of renovating freshman common rooms while at Harvard over the coming summer.
“We want to make the rooms a cooler place for freshmen to hang out in and we want the freshmen who live in the dorms to feel more ownership of the space,” he said.
According to Ebrahim, the committee considered modifications that could be made with a limited budget and within a short time frame when drafting its recommendations.
“Fixing a common room under Wigglesworth would be a lot cheaper than building a $5 million student center,” Dingman said.
The report also recommended the creation of more freshman-specific programming and the creation of a centralized events calendar.
Dingman said that the source of funding for any approved changes has not yet been determined.
Hammonds commissioned the Freshman Space Working Group to address first year’s concerns about the availability of space.
She will review the group’s suggestions before any plans are finalized.

On April 8, throngs of people lined up outside of Pinkberry’s recently-opened clear glass doors to get a taste of the company’s frozen yogurt. New to Cambridge, the store had already begun drawing patrons the night before its official debut by giving away free samples.
Its arrival challenges Berryline’s monopoly on the frozen yogurt market. Now it is no longer the only store in the area that primarily sells the dessert option touted as healthier than ice cream.
While community members are excited about the new arrival, many are wondering if the local market can sustain two frozen yogurt stores.
THE BERRIES’ BEGINNINGS
Berryline was one of the first tart-yogurt shops in the entire state of Massachusetts, according to co-founder Matthew A. Wallace.
Since its inception, Berryline has prided itself on catering specifically to the Harvard Square market.
“We were both studying in the area,” says Wallace of the choice to open their first store on Arrow Street. Wallace was enrolled at MIT and the other founder, Pok “Eric” K. Yang, was at Harvard.
“As students, we were always hanging out here so we wanted our store to become part of the large student community here,” says Wallace.
“Many of the shops that are popular on the West Coast have that city-like, busy hub feel,” Yang adds. “[However], we wanted to be like your local coffee shop or local small business.”
Pinkberry, on the other hand, has cultivated its reputation worldwide. Its first store opened in West Hollywood, California in 2005 and it has since expanded to multiple locations all over the United States and internationally in countries including Canada, Bahrain, and Qatar. A 2007 “Fast Company” article once declared Pinkberry “the most famous” brand of yogurt within the United States.
Founded by restaurateur Shelly Hwang and architect Young Lee, Pinkberry has prided itself not only on the taste and variety of its yogurt but also its unique brand-name experience. The 2007 article reported that, as a result, Pinkberry has been careful in its expansion to select locations that appeal to its high-end image.
COMPETING FOR THE COMMUNITY
By providing buy-one-get-one deals for specific events, supporting various student groups, and speaking at different Harvard events, Berryline has actively engaged with the community since its arrival in Harvard Square in September 2007. In addition to established relationships with college students, Berryline has forged ties with other area businesses as well as local artists, whose pictures hang on the walls of the store.
“We always love making new connections with people in the area. Berryline is local, genuine and real, and we hope it shows in both our product and our customer service,” says General Manager of the Arrow Street Berryline Min-Young Hwang.
Given the company’s knowledge of the area, the business has never felt the need to advertise, according to Wallace.
The founders of the store can even be seen working there for at least a couple of hours every week.
“Berryline is a place where people know your name,” says Hwang.
New to Cambridge, Pinkberry’s mission focuses more on its nationally-acclaimed product, according to Vice President of Brand Marketing Suzanne Ginestro.
But Pinkberry has also tried to enhance its community presence in Harvard Square. Before opening its doors, the store established a connection with Her Campus, reached out to the student population, and forged ties with local businesses.
In the first few weeks of Pinkberry’s debut, the turnout remained high.
“The Harvard Square community has really embraced us and we couldn’t be happier to be a part of it,” says Ginestro.
Well located, at the entrance to the Harvard T stop, and secure in the quality of its unique brand, Pinkberry representatives say they are not worried about competition from Berryline.
“We do not like to think in terms of having an advantage or disadvantage compared to another company, we simply continuously strive to offer the best product and experience to our patrons,” says Ginestro.
Berryline’s owners echo these sentiments.
“We’re obviously curious to see if we’re going to take a hit because of the other frozen yogurt shop,” Wallace says, “But we’re keeping true to what we’ve always done—staying a part of the community and preserving that local feel.”
CHOOSING SIDES
The presence of the two frozen yogurt chains has drawn the attention of the Harvard Square community and caused many students and Cambridge residents to passionately defend their preference.
Students say that taste, variety, and the general comfort level provided by the different stores are factors in determining whether they prefer Pinkberry or Berryline.
“The reason I like Pinkberry is because they’re open at 9 a.m. and they have a lot of options,” says Elizabeth C. Ahern ’12. “They’re a little cheaper because they give you more toppings, and they don’t charge per topping. They have better flavors than Berryline,” she adds.
Some students note that Pinkberry is more conveniently located.
“It’s a social place where people can hang out,” says Yen Chin “Christine” Chen ’14. “You can satisfy that midnight craving of froyo.”
But some students and residents are quick to defend the originality of Berryline.
“What I like about Berryline is the culture and the atmosphere. Berryline is a nicer, cuter, hole-in-the-wall place,” says Sabina Ceric ’12. “I don’t like the corporate-y feel of Pinkberry. I think what it’ll end up happening is Pinkberry will be very touristy and Berryline will still get a lot of college students.”
Grant M. Jones ’14, who serves as a student representative for Berryline, also notes that the store has done a lot of work to build a reputation within the Harvard community, which will keep customers loyal.
“It’s not just frozen yogurt,” Jones says. “Not only is the taste better by far—it’s the local feel, the community, and the people. It’s so much cozier and familiar than [Pinkberry] with [its] industrial feel. I just love the brand.”
The warm atmosphere that many Berryline devotees describe may stem from the store’s origins.
“We were students,” Wallace says, “We did things the way college students would do them. We bought Target furniture and stuck it in our store. We gave it that homey feel because we made it like we would make a dorm room.”
ROOM FOR TWO
Big corporate chains like Pinkberry are in the minority in Harvard Square. Almost 80 percent of Square businesses are locally owned, and another 5 percent have regional headquarters. By contrast, national and international shops comprise only about 15 percent.
According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, the distinct business styles of Pinkberry and Berryline are representative of the mesh of small independent shops and national chains that have long been thriving in the Square.
“Large nationals really have a good understanding of merchandising, advertising, and display that the smaller independents benefit from. By that, I mean, they can emulate them,” Jillson says.
On the other hand, Jillson attributed the ability of small independent businesses to make quick decisions as a “real advantage for them” in the changing economic environment. “They have the ability to grab a broom, go outside, arrange flower baskets, and make their storefronts very appealing. They don’t have to call corporate headquarters across the country,” she says.
Jillson suggests that the future of the sweet debate may not be all that bitter, as Harvard Square has seen a variety of similar businesses exist side-by-side for years.
“We have lots of perfect examples of coexistence,” Jillson says. Indeed, the Harvard Square area supports two—soon to be three—different Starbucks stores, in addition to a plethora of other locally-owned coffee shops.
For their own part, the frozen yogurt stores say they are content to share the market.
According to Ginestro, Pinkberry is “happy to coexist with other shops in the area.”
“Every shop is different and has served their own interpretation of frozen yogurt,” she says.
The Berryline founders agree.
“There’s room in the market for everybody,” says Wallace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust, Professor Homi K. Bhabha, and other members of the Harvard community celebrated the inauguration of the newly renamed Mahindra Humanities Center at a gathering in University Hall yesterday.
Formerly known as the Harvard Humanities Center, the center is supported in part by a $10 million gift from Anand G. Mahindra ’77 made to the University in October 2010, the largest in Harvard’s history to be allocated exclusively to the humanities.
“Gifts of this nature are often recognized by place: a building, a title, a plaque, a hall,” Bhabha, the director of the center, said to the audience.
“To endow an institution, however, is also to make a tryst with time and to align one’s hopes and aspirations with the history of that institution,” he said.
The Mahindra Humanities Center will support a series of lectures, conferences, seminars, and graduate and postdoctoral fellowships.
This financial support aligns closely with an increased emphasis on the importance of the humanities on campus, amid doubts about its survival in the future.
“Your gift will contribute to the transformation of the humanities at Harvard because you have secured our future and provided us with the most precious of gifts: time,” Bhabha said. “Your gift of time has turned us from being hostages of the future to hosts who can throw open our doors to the rich possibilities that stand ahead of us.”
The $10 million donation, made by Mahindra in the memory of his deceased mother, honors her influence and reflects his appreciation for the full scholarship and education that he received as an undergraduate at Harvard.
“As I stand here before you today, it is out of a desire to repay this extraordinary act of generosity of this university many years ago,” he said.
Mahindra also told the audience that financial support for the humanities was inspired by a conversation with his mother, who urged him to always encourage his children no matter what choices they made.
“It was then that I realized that the nourishment and faith of a parent are probably at the heart of the survival of the liberal arts,” he said. “Indeed, this is particularly true of the humanities in emerging economies that are primarily concerned with producing material goods.”
The inauguration continued in a procession from University Hall to the steps of the Mahindra Humanities Center. Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, joined Mahindra and his family in unveiling the newly named building.
“This initiative draws together Harvard’s broad-reaching excellence and pushes it in new directions,” Smith said. “In his donation, Anand Mahindra has strengthened his experiences and is also strengthening Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sustainable agriculture advocate Fred Kirschenmann said that society needs to rethink agriculture in a talk in Sever Hall yesterday, arguing that the depletion of mineral and fossil fuel resources, the effects of climate change, and loss of biodiversity indicate that the current agricultural system cannot continue to provide for the Earth’s population indefinitely.
While acknowledging that he had presented “a grim picture,” Kirschenmann insisted that “I think we can beat these challenges that we’re going to be facing.”
The Centre for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services, and the Food Literacy Project co-organized the event so that Kirschenmann, a Distinguished Fellow for the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, could present his thoughts on sustainable agriculture to the Harvard community.
Kirschenmann said that, while using up limited fossil fuel resources was a significant problem, it was naïve to think that simply transitioning to green fuel sources will resolve it.
“We have to redesign the food system in this new era that we’re moving into in order to be sustainable,” Kirschenmann said.
“We need to be rethinking the paradigm,” he added. “Part of the solution is to really rethink how we do agriculture.”
Kirschenmann particularly emphasized the importance of educating and engaging urban populations in conversations about agriculture and food production.
“These changes are not going to come from Washington, at least not in the initial stages,” he said, advocating for changes at the level of the local community.
“The [Harvard Community] Garden is probably the result of conversations I once had with him,” Kathleen Frith, Managing Director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment, told the audience as she introduced Kirschenmann.
“We got a lot more people than I expected [to attend],” said Dara B. Olmsted ’00, co-ordinator of the Food Literacy Project at HUHDS. “There were college students, graduate students, staff, alumni, and people from the community.”
Attendee Louisa C. Denison ’11, who has been involved in the Harvard Community Garden project, said she thought Kirschenmann’s talk would stimulate further discussion about sustainability among those involved with Community Garden.
“As gardeners and kids interested in agriculture, we enjoyed the focus on the implementation rather than academics,” said Denison.

Last night, the Cambridge City Council continued a contentious debate regarding zoning policies—but first took a moment to recognize Cambridge Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff, who was recently named to an advisory position in the Obama administration.
Semonoff learned last week that she will be joining the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health, a 25-member body which will assist in the design of a national preventative health model.
“There are so many things in Cambridge that we do across the board, connected to prevention, that really put us in the forefront,” Semonoff said.
Semonoff is also the Vice Chair of the Cambridge Health Alliance, a Harvard-affiliated public healthcare system that serves both Cambridge and Sommerville.
The congratulatory tone of the Council quickly dissolved later in the meeting, as Councilor Craig A. Kelley requested that the Council order the City Solicitor’s office to issue a legal opinion on Section 5.28.2 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance—which allows for former commercial properties to be converted for residential use.
“This is an example of having the city staff chasing their tail,” said Mayor David P. Maher, referring to the redundancy of asking for a legal opinion on the issue while others involved in city government are already assessing zoning policy.
Maher seconded the objections to the ordinance, originally voiced by Councilor Sam Seidel, that this would stall work already underway on zoning reform. “I just see this as waste of the city staff’s time,” said Maher.
Councilors who opposed the request for a legal opinion said that the order goes against the Council’s intent to meet the need for more housing, and more specifically affordable housing, in Cambridge.
Councilor Marjorie C. Decker said she was surprised at the appearance of the order.
“It is an attempt to actually undermine what we intended 12 years ago, which is to promote more housing,” she said.
Decker went on to specifically question her colleague’s motivations in asking for the rendering of a legal opinion.
The order was initially proposed by Kelley and Councilor Leland Cheung, following an initiative to create new multifamily housing developments in Cambridge.
Kelley said he was not satisfied with the response from the city administration regarding the interpretation of the city ordinance.
“We got a response back, but we really didn’t get answers,” he said.
Ultimately, the motion requesting a legal opinion on the ordinance failed, with only Kelley and Cheung voting in favor.
“This is the wrong order at the wrong time,” Vice Mayor Henrietta S. Davis said.

Harvard President Drew G. Faust honored the first 10 recipients of the newly initiated Presidential Public Service Fellowship Program, a program that provides funding for summer service projects, at an award luncheon last Wednesday.
The fellowship, which Faust created with financial assistance from a single anonymous donor, offers grants of up to $5,000 for undergraduates or $10,000 for students of any of Harvard’s graduate schools.
Faust, who noted she wanted to create “a cohort of individuals” who could become a leadership team for public service in the Harvard community, said the idea for the fellowship arose last year when the University was featuring public service.
“We thought it was important to have a signature program supported by the president, representing the whole University,” Faust said, noting that  many of Harvard’s schools have their own public service programming.
This year’s 10 fellows will use their funding for a variety of different projects, including efforts in voter outreach, education and legal services for underprivileged communities, the formation of environmental and international policies, community organizing, and the implementation of health care information technology services in rural areas.
David H. A. LeBoeuf ’13, a Worcester, Mass. native, is a founding member of Coalition for Educated Options, a non-partisan group dedicated to voter outreach, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter protection in historically low-turnout precincts. LeBoeuf’s project will focus on increasing voter information in his hometown.
LeBoeuf, who is also a Crimson news writer, said he hopes to help the cause of underrepresented communities and to “make candidates recognize that there are a lot of different populations in the city besides the typical people they campaign after.”
Carolyn W. Chou ’13, another fellowship recipient who will work at the Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment Summer Program in Dorcester, Mass., said her personal focus will be on “embracing the cultures [the children] come from and introducing them to the new place they’re living while making them feel empowered to have a voice in that new community.”
A teacher of English, math, science, and civics at BRYE since her freshman year, Chou works with students aged 6 through 13 who immigrated from at least 12 countries including Vietnam and Uganda.
“I’m grateful that there is this new funding source to help the camp provide the best services possible,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine female representatives from a variety of undergraduate organizations met in Holden Chapel yesterday to talk about the challenges facing Harvard women pursuing leadership positions on campus.
Student panelists, ranging from the heads of student political groups to the former president of HUTV, commented on how they reached their current positions and their respective experiences as women in charge.
The discussion was moderated by Nannerl O. Keohane, a former president of Wellesley College and Duke University and a current Princeton professor.
The event grew partially out of a discussion about underrepresentation of women on the Undergraduate Council, which cosponsored the event with the Harvard College Women’s Center.
In last fall’s election of new freshman representatives to the UC, eleven of the twelve positions were filled by men.
“It is the single biggest problem for the UC right now,” said Bonnie Cao ’12, vice-president of the UC, who served as a panelist.
Keohane opened the event by describing the findings of a recent report she and several of her colleagues wrote on the achievement and leadership of female Princeton undergraduates.
The report concluded that there were subtle, but real differences between the ways in which men and women took advantage of extracurricular opportunities on campus.
In particular, women tended to do more work than men, undersell themselves, and fill roles with less visibility but greater impact.
“We want to make clear that both high profile jobs and jobs behind the scenes are important leadership positions,” said Keohane. “But we also wanted to point out the important advantages of high-profile jobs.”
In response to concerns over the lack of confidence among female students, Keohane suggested a number of possible solutions, including an increased focus on upperclassman mentors.
“The reason I got involved with the Dems was because the president, who was a woman, reached out to me when I was a freshman,” said Katie R. Zavadski ’13, the current Vice President of the Harvard College Democrats, who is also a Crimson editorial comper.
While they debated additional methods for dealing with the issue of gender imbalance, the panelists agreed on the benefits of holding a leadership positions and building strong communities.
“In high school I was a go-getter, but when I got to college I was very intimidated,” said Beverly E. Pozuelos ’12, the President of Latinas Unidas and a Crimson design editor. “Leadership helped me find my voice.”
“I would encourage the Harvard community and administration to take a close look at [Keohane’s] report,” said Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11, a former member of the UC who organized the panel. “We came to a lot of interesting suggestions that we could integrate at Harvard.”

In what organizers, attendees, and speakers said was a testament to the strengthened relationship between Harvard and the military, Harvard student veterans gathered yesterday evening at an event honoring their service.
Retired General Stanley A. McChrystal, former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, delivered the keynote address, speaking candidly about his experiences as a military leader and about current foreign policy issues.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor David Gergen said that the event—hosted by the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School—was likely the largest gathering of Harvard student veterans since World War II. Though said in front of a large crowd that packed a ballroom at the Sheraton Commander Hotel, most of McChrystal’s remarks were off the record.
“When Harvard embraces veterans and families like [it] did tonight, it sets a tone and a trend,” McChrystal told The Crimson after the event, echoing one of the themes of the evening. “That ability to articulate specially that this institution, which is one of the most important in the nation, goes to this level of effort impacts everyone. Harvard [is a] bellwether for education.”
McChrystal, who resigned after openly criticizing President Obama in a magazine article last summer, also said more broadly that he hopes more students will consider service careers.
“I would personally like to see everyone at institutions like this [to] first think: where am I going to serve?” he said. “I would like them to think, I’ve got to do something that makes me feel like I’ve given something to the nation.”
Seth W. Moulton ’01—who served in Iraq with the Marine Corps and is now a resident tutor in Quincy House and a student at HKS and Harvard Business School—said he has been impressed by the number of students who have taken up service careers in recent years.
“One of the things this dinner shows is that it’s a hard choice, but that it’s a good choice,” he said. “Harvard isn’t holding a dinner to celebrate all the veterans of Wall Street.”
Taylor B. Evans ’14—a five year Marine Corps veteran—said the dinner was the latest in a string of happenings that have improved the public impression of relations between Harvard and the military.
“The last few months have been very positive for [the military’s] relationship with higher education,” he said.
In remarks at last night’s event, HKS Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 attributed much of this success to the leadership of University President Drew G. Faust.
“From the day she became president ... she was the most committed person I knew to making ROTC happen at Harvard,” Ellwood said in reference to bringing the Reserve Officer Training Corps back to Harvard. The University recognized ROTC this March for the first time since the Vietnam War.
The event, which was attended by approximately 200 student veterans primarily enrolled in graduate schools across the University, is the third annual dinner honoring student veterans.
Gergen followed McChrystal with forward-looking remarks directed at the veterans.
“We honor you for your service, for what you have done, but we do it in the spirit of what you can be,” he said. “[There] is a sense that you can be the next Greatest Generation. You have in your capacity the power to do things that this country so desperately needs.”
McChrystal said that he could not agree more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The journal Science will publish on Friday a replication of a 2007 ­study co-authored by Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser, who was found to be “solely responsible” for eight charges of scientific misconduct in a University investigation last August.
Hauser’s original work, which studied the ability of animals to perceive other animals’ intentions based on their actions, was one of the three studies that came under question following the controversy regarding his research.
The new clarification, which confirms the findings from the 2007 report, concludes a long discussion on the integrity of the original research,  which Hauser conducted with Justin N. Wood, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California.
As a result of the investigation into Hauser’s conduct, Wood learned that data was missing from the 2007 study, and notified Science in July 2010.
The current results “replicate those reported in the original paper in terms of statistical significance,” according to a statement written by Science’s staff.
In the statement, Science said that the research was replicated only for this particular study, and has no bearing on the reliability of Hauser’s other research.
The original experiments were conducted on three different types of primates: cotton-top tamarins, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys.
According to the Science report, Wood later discovered that “there were only summary data, as opposed to raw data, for the rhesus monkey experiments because the researcher who performed the experiments inadvertently failed to archive the original field notes.”
An internal examination performed by the University determined that the hand-written records of the original raw data for the rhesus monkeys were unintentionally discarded, according to the letter Wood submitted to Science.
After realizing that the data for the study was lost, Wood and Hauser began re-running their experiments on rhesus monkeys.
According to Ginger Pinholster, director of the Office of Public Programs at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes Science, the journal carefully peer reviewed the new conclusions in the wake of realizations of Hauser’s misconduct.
“It was a pretty painstaking re-review process,” Pinholster said. “We wouldn’t publish a replication unless we felt that the peer reviewers had done a very thorough job and their assessment was the authors had sufficiently replicated the original finding.”
Pinholster further emphasized that the judgments of the peer review process only apply to the replication of the 2007 study.
“We did not make any effort to raise any questions about Hauser’s broader body of work,” she said.
Pinholster declined to comment on the specific evaluations the replicated study underwent before publication, saying that there is a “long-standing policy” of not disclosing those details.
Hauser could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few in the Harvard community could list all of the school’s 41 varsity teams. And even fewer could name all Crimson club sports.
So, it’s not too surprising that the Harvard Polo club teams, two of the newest additions to the club program, remain relatively unknown.
After the teams’ nearly 20-year hiatus, Nick Snow ’09 and his parents Cissie and Crocker Snow ’61 revived the club in the 2006 season. Even after Nick’s graduation, Cissie and Crocker decided to stay with Crimson polo and continue to coach the women’s and men’s teams, respectively.
Now, despite being back for its fourth full season, the polo club continues to be under the radar, and when mentioned, is often associated with the stereotype of being a glamorous, elitist sport.
But this isn’t Ralph Lauren’s Polo.
“I think most people have the image of white britches,” Crocker Snow said. “But the reality is dungarees.”
“It’s a work to ride atmosphere,” Cissie Snow agreed.
All players must take part in horsemanship, or caring for the horses. Specifically, riders are required to feed and brush the horses, take them back and forth to the barn, and muck out stalls.
While other Harvard athletes play and practice across the Charles, polo practices and games are held at the Myopia Outdoor Arena in Ipswich, Mass., nearly an hour drive away.
On practice days, players are usually gone from 2-8 p.m., and most riders go out at least twice a week. Some go as many as five, like freshman Janie Amero.
But to Amero, it isn’t much of a sacrifice.
“I love coming out and spending time with the horses,” Amero said. “It’s really beautiful here, and it’s nice to get out of Cambridge. Sometimes it can be lot of work, but for me, it’s completely worth it.”
Even more notable than the players’ time commitment is the fact that none of them had played polo before coming to Harvard.
Junior W. Albany Mulholland, the men’s team’s top scorer, had never even ridden a horse prior to college.
“I played rugby at home and was looking for a new sport when I came here,” Mulholand said. “It seemed like a great opportunity that I wouldn’t find anywhere else. And so I came out for a taste of it and really enjoyed it. ... [I] haven’t looked back since.”
Both Cissie and Crocker Snow are not intimidated by the tough task of coaching inexperienced players.
“It’s challenging but very rewarding at the same time,” Cissie Snow said. “It’s a matter of training them first to respect the horse [and then] to understand that they have feelings too.”
“We’re also getting kids who have never ridden before, ridden very little, or ridden in a different style,” Snow added. “[The progression] is from the horse, to the mallet, to actually playing the game.”
But while coaching new polo players may not be difficult for the Snows, finding funds for the teams is a constant struggle.
Even with yearly varsity dues of $1,250 and support from the Harvard Athletic Association, the teams do not have a large enough budget to afford a winterized barn or the 40-50 horses that well-established teams such as the University of Virginia and the University of Connecticut have.
But as with many Harvard sports, generous donations from alumni help bolster the teams’ resources. Perhaps the program’s biggest supporter is actor Tommy Lee Jones ’69, who hosts the teams at his Texas ranch for preseason riding and has donated a 12-horse truck and trailer along with several reliable ponies in the last three years.
Just as the teams have been given support from alumni and donors, the Harvard polo teams also have plans to give back. Currently, the club is working on adding a modest therapeutic riding program for the physically or mentally handicapped and other members of the Harvard community.
“There’s nothing like children with disabilities being with animals,” said University Disabilities Coordinator Marie Trottier. “I’ve seen the effects of putting them on the horse. And especially with soldiers coming back as wounded warriors back from Iraq and Afghanistan. It touches your heart in an amazing way, and I’m excited that we’re going to be doing that with Harvard polo.”
But therapy is not the sole purpose of the riding program.
“We just thought that it would help to give a better understanding of polo for people who don’t understand polo if we give therapeutic riding as well,” Trottier said.
That way, the club could gain some needed attention and, over time, accomplish its long-term goal: becoming a full-fledged varsity sport.
“One big disadvantage we face that other schools don’t is that we’re not able to recruit kids who played polo in high school because we’re a club sport,” women’s captain Samantha Drago wrote in an email.
But becoming a varsity sport would also have its drawbacks.
“The flip side to that is that people like me, who love riding but never played polo, might not get as many opportunities to play as they do now,” Drago added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only a month left before the national championship and the start of the postseason just around the corner, the Harvard women’s sailing team needed a finish in the top half of the field at the Reed Trophy Regatta to follow in the footsteps of its co-ed counterpart and extend its spring season.
The Crimson proved to be up to the challenge, taking home a fifth-place finish over the weekend to earn a spot in the ICSA Women’s National Championship.
The co-ed squad also had a solid weekend of sailing after qualifying for the ICSA Eastern Dinghy Championship Semifinal the previous week, finishing second in the Savin Hill Invitational and the Wellesley-Babson Tech Invite.
REED TROPHY, 45th WOMEN’S NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIP
The first day of racing at Bethel Point, Maine, did not provide optimal sailing conditions, as the Crimson had to battle rain, sleet, and even some snow all day. The second day proved to have nicer conditions, but the regatta had to be called early due to the lack of breeze.
Harvard finished the 45th Women’s New England Championship, hosted by Bowdoin, in fifth place, clinching a postseason berth.
The Crimson was once again led by a strong A-division performance from junior captain Alex Jumper and classmate Emily Lambert, highlighted by three second-place finishes. With Lambert at skipper, the duo managed to best Ivy League rival Yale by two points, finishing in second place only behind Boston College, the top-ranked team in the nation.
Senior Meghan Wareham, who typically sails with the co-ed squad, joined freshman skipper Morgan Russom to compete in the B division.  Racing together for the first time this season, the duo managed to capture two sixth-place finishes but finished in ninth place in five of the six other races. Overall, the pair finished the regatta in 10th place.
“It’s a culmination of all of the hard work that we have put in this season,” Jumper said. “Most of the top teams in the country are in the New England area, so we compete against them all the time, whether in conference races or this week’s past regatta. We’ll probably see most of these teams in the postseason, so we’ll take all of the competition and use it as preparation for high pressure environments.”
ADMIRAL’S CUP
Meanwhile, the co-ed squad, fresh off of qualifying for the postseason last weekend, traveled to King’s Point, N.Y., to compete in the Admiral’s Cup Regatta. Racing against 16 of the top teams in the country, Harvard proved that it could sail with the best in the nation. The Crimson turned in one of the most consistent performances of the weekend, garnering a second-place finish, even though none of Harvard’s teams finished above fourth place in their individual divisions.
“This regatta was more fleet racing, which will be more of the type of racing we’ll see at the national semifinals,” sophomore Alma Lafler said. “We were just using this as experience to get ready for the postseason.”
In the A division, senior skipper Alan Palmer teamed up with classmate Quincy Bock and Lafler, who split crew duties, to capture fifth place in the tightly contested division.
The B-division squad, comprised of senior skipper John Stokes and crews Bock, Lafler, and sophomore Jason Michas, turned in a fifth-place finish as well.
Senior Tedd Himler took care of the C-division races on his own, finishing in fourth place in a very competitive division that saw fourth, fifth, and sixth places separated by only two points.
“We were hoping to use this regatta as practice and a last-minute tune-up for semis in California this weekend,” Palmer said.
WELLESLEY-BABSON TECH INVITE
The final regatta may not have had any implications on the postseason for college sailing, but nonetheless, the Crimson competed at a high level against in-state rivals Tufts, Wellesley, and Boston University.
Each college sent out two teams to compete in the local-level event on the nearby Charles River. The Harvard A and B teams both turned in remarkable scores, finishing in second and third places, respectively. First place went to Tufts with a low score of 15, while the Crimson teams turned in scores of 20 and 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite rough conditions on the Charles River, Radcliffe’s heavyweight first varsity eight (7-4) toppled Yale (6-3) for the first time since 2003 on Saturday.
The victory over the defending NCAA champions came at a crucial moment in the season, as the team heads to the EAWRC Sprints in less than a month.
“We went out with the mindset of racing our own race [and] not focusing what was going on around us, whether it was the weather or the other team,” said junior five seat Liz Soutter. “Instead, we focused on making our boat go fast no matter what.”
As usual, the Ivy League is fielding some of the fastest boats in the country with four schools sitting in the top ten in CRCA/USRowing Coaches’ Poll: No. 1 Princeton, No. 6 Brown, No. 8 Yale, and No. 10 Cornell. The Black and White, currently ranked 16th, missed out on the NCAA championships last year, but this year could be a different story.
“This win has definitely given us a huge confidence boost,” Soutter said.  “Yale is one of our toughest competitors and edging them out has helped us bring the NCAA into our sight more clearly … and that’s been our goal for this entire year.”
Radcliffe trailed the Bulldogs early until a late push shot the Black and White ahead to defeat Yale by three seconds and six seats.
“We got down in the first 500 … but coming into the 1000-meter mark we all knew what we had to do,” said co-captain and stroke Liv Coffey. “And we knew that Yale couldn’t hold us back. Going into the second half of the third 500, we made a press and came even with them, … and at that point, I think, Yale just cracked.”
“There was no specific move that helped us move through Yale,” Soutter added. “But every move and stroke was powerful, so that during the second half of the race we were consistently moving through them. Yale wasn’t really moving consistently. They were just pushing a little for 10 strokes and then holding while we just got faster throughout the entire race, and we were able to shake them through the finish.”
On Saturday, the boat was composed of junior coxswain Jill Carlson, Coffey at stroke, sophomore Shelley Pearson in the seven seat, freshman Katie Wilcox in six, Soutter in five, sophomore Celia Kohl in four, sophomore Scout Moran in three, sophomore Mary Maginnis in two, and junior Christina McClintock, who is also a Crimson sports editor, in bow.
“Rowing’s a thing where you’re only as good as your collective speed,” Coffey said. “You can’t really pick one person out and say, ‘Oh you definitely pulled harder than everybody else.’”
The boat has been rowing together all spring and has come together both on and off the water.
“If you have a strong group, it just means you’re going to be successful,” Coffey said. “Our boat is filled with really competitive, really successful girls who have raced at all different levels. I go into a race completely confident that they know what’s going to go on and that they can react to basically any situation.”
This group mentality has helped the Black and White both in competition on the water and in long conditioning sessions.
“I think that everyone on the team has a lot of respect for each other,” Coffey said. “Everyone’s been willing to work very hard.”
The rowers’ respect for each other has made itself evident in the group’s attitude towards competition as well.
“The theme for our boat this whole season has been to be fearless no matter what,” Soutter said. “We’ve had some pretty scary racing conditions and gone up against some really tough crews, but we’ve never gone into a race feeling daunted. We always go in laying everything out on the line, and we never hold back. If you put your best into every single stroke, you’re never going to regret your race when you finish.”
The team’s audacity on the water is accentuated by the fact that it fields a young squad.
“Our team is very young, so I knew that our season would get off to a slow start,” Coffey said. “But we’re getting faster, like you usually do over the course of a season, but even more so this year. As the younger girls are getting more experienced, we’re going to get a lot of speed going into those championship races.”

Long walks, sometimes unreliable shuttles, and now coyotes? The list of grievances of life in the Quad got a little bit longer after coyotes were spotted on the frequently trodden path between the Radcliffe Quadrangle and the Yard.
"We've had coyotes in the city for a while now," said Christina Correia of the Cambridge Animal Commission. "Recently we've had sightings of them living in the cemeteries, both Mt. Auburn and Cambridge, but they keep a territory of between two and thirty miles, so really they could be seen anywhere in the area."
Urban coyotes are no new phenomenon in these parts. In fact, the only parts of Massachusetts that have not had any coyote sightings are Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.
Coyotes weigh between 33 and 47 pounds and are generally no danger to humans but can be deadly for pets and a nuisance for garbage workers. While they may not pose problems for most Harvard students, they may be a threat to late night wanderers who may accidently impose on the coyote's personal space. They are primarily nocturnal and generally move in small groups opportunistically looking for food.
Combined with the increased levels of violence this year, the coyotes serve as another incentive for people to continue to take advantage of the Harvard shuttle service late at night. For those who walk, traveling in pairs should reduce the risk of encountering the beast that has almost single-handedly kept the Canada geese population at bay.
Coyotes may look like dogs, and in fact they are canines, but they're less cute than their domestic cousins. So remember, stay safe and keep your wits about you, or else you could end up like this guy.

As Donald Trump prepares his bid for the GOP presidential nomination, he continues his attacks on President Barack H. Obama, claiming Obama was a "terrible student" and questioning the president's ability to have attended both Columbia University and Harvard Law School.
Trump has made headlines recently for reviving the birther debate and for demanding that the president reveal his birth records. Now the billionaire is taking it one step further, calling on Obama to reveal his academic records, believing there to be an inconsistency between Obama's academic performance and his acceptance to two elite universities.
"I heard he was a terrible student ... Let him show his records," Trump said in an Associated Press interview. "I have friends who have smart sons with great marks, great boards, great everything, and they can't get into Harvard," he added.
But one needs to look no further than former President John F. Kennedy '40 to realize that there may be precedent for Obama's supposed delinquency. Kennedy's application to Harvard shows that he was a lackluster student. Regardless, Kennedy and Obama were both actively involved with Harvard student publications—Kennedy was an editor of The Crimson while Obama served as president of the Harvard Law Review.
And never mind the fact that Obama graduated magna cum laude from HLS. We hear they just give those things away.

Are you a thrill-seeker looking for your next adventure? Try jumping from a plane.
On Sunday, May 8, the Friends of the Harvard Aviation Club will be leading a skydiving trip. The trip is open to anyone who wants to lottery for one of 40 slots.
"It's a great experience," said Benjamin L. Brinkopf  '11, president of the Harvard Aviation Club. "And it's very, very safe."
The jump will take place in northern Massachusetts at Skydive Pepperell. Pepperell, situated on the border of Massachusetts and Nashua, N.H., is the closest drop zone to Boston.
The trip was a hit last semester after about 40 students entered the lottery for 10 skydiving slots. According to Brinkopf, the Friends of the Harvard Aviation Club were able to expand to 40 slots. However, over 100 students have entered the lottery this time around, and slots are filling up fast.
"I'm going skydiving this time," Brinkopf said. "I gave up my spot last time because so many people wanted the chance to do it."
An increase in the number of participants has allowed the cost of the trip to decrease by roughly $100 per capita. The cost of the trip includes transportation and skydiving, but not meals.
"We're running it at cost because we want people who have passion and desire to do it," Brinkopf said. "The lower the cost, the more people it will appeal to."
Those who have never gone skydiving before will be required to jump tandem, which means they will be harnessed to someone who has done the jump at least a thousand times before. The instructor will guide the first-time jumper through the process from freefall to landing.
Sign up for the trip here. The $50 deposit is due by tomorrow.
