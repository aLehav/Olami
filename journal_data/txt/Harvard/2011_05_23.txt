Efforts to raise the dead rarely go well. Frankenstein’s monster ended up killing its creator; popular lore warns that when zombies exit their graves, it’s a sign of the coming apocalypse. Nonetheless, the Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston has attempted its own form of cultural resurrection in its current exhibition, “The Record: Contemporary Art and Vinyl.” Organized by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, the exhibit takes on a medium generally considered dead—vinyl—and argues for its current relevance. The diverse works in the show—made from sound, video and mixed media—offer attempts to breathe life into records. But as a whole, the ICA’s presentation is limp and witless, too bogged down with shallow nostalgia to present a potent argument for the importance of vinyl.
Some works do stand out, especially those that engage with vinyl as a physical medium. Foremost among these are the five pieces by Christian Marclay, a New York artist active since the late 1970s. Marclay focuses much of his work on the distortions of sound made possible by vinyl; he is largely credited with the invention of turntabling. In his piece, “Looking for Love,” a needle bumps across a record playing songs about romance; in “Ghost (I Don’t Live Today)” Marclay straps a modified record-player to himself and jams like Jimi Hendrix.
Taiyo Kimura’s fantastic video “Haunted By You” takes a more mischievous approach to vinyl distortions. Kimura toys with his turntable by replacing the arm with a chicken leg and slicing an apple placed on the record with a knife attached to his face. At one point he throws a real octopus on the vinyl just to film what happens. The record keeps on spinning. Unfortunately, though, the confines of the ICA’s gallery space reduce the effects of the video and sound pieces. Sounds blend together, and some of the subtler pieces are hard to grasp. Su-Mei Tse’s “White Noise”—in which small white balls are placed up on a turning record to replicate the crackling sounds before a song is played on a record—could barely be heard over the neighboring works.
This is a shame, because the visual works deal with vinyl much more superficially. Dave Muller’s two large paintings “Dave’s Top Ten (03/23/09: Muller Family Favorites)” and “Jake’s Top Ten (Nostalgia)” act as tributes to the dying art of record-collecting. Each painting is a large-scale representation of an ideal vinyl collection, the corners of the records frayed and worn from use. Muller presents his work with care and his own sense of loss is abundantly clear. But his work is more of an extension of nostalgia about the disappearance of records than a meditation on it. The paintings run solely on specific allusions to popular culture such as “Top Ten” lists in magazines like “Rolling Stone” and the kind of name-dropping that marks a website like “Pitchfork” or a movie like “High Fidelity.” As a result, they cater to a like-minded crowd instead of attempting to advertise their ideas to a larger audience.
The obsession with personal loss marks much of the art in “The Record,” and it is the exhibit’s greatest weakness. The exhibition makes no secret of the fact that it is dealing with nostalgia. Many of the works refer to the emotion explicitly. Alice Wagner remakes the covers of albums she saw as a child with colored thread and wax; Moyra Davey photographs vinyl collections in private homes. In these works, vinyl comes across as more of a relic than an object of greater importance. Its value lies only in the personal experience of the artist. Nor is the emotion of nostalgia fully explored as its own cultural force, and its prevalence in contemporary art deserves a critical look. An art exhibit based on a musical innovation that had its heyday decades ago could have been a good place to start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Smoking has long been a problem for many Americans, but anti-smoking campaigns have made serious progress throughout the country. More than 365 colleges nationwide have joined this trend by banning smoking both indoors and out. Harvard has tentatively followed by prohibiting smoking in all areas of upper-class Houses and freshman dormitories and within 25 feet of any university buildings.
On any given night, however, one readily sees these regulations disregarded by smokers huddled in circles in the Yard. These scenes support the idea that smoking is typically a social practice, but given Harvard’s highly competitive and highly stressful environment, one must wonder if students are driven to smoking for more troubling reasons. The Harvard community must understand why students decide to start smoking. In seeking answers, anti-smoking groups need to focus on eliminating the causes, not lashing out at smokers.
Last spring, the Tobacco Control Policy Group, a subgroup of the Institute of Politics, conducted a survey to understand smoking habits among Harvard College students. Out of the 462 students who responded, 10 percent admitted to currently being smokers. These results were lower than the national average derived from the National College Health Assessment during the spring of 2010, which found that 16 percent of those college students who responded had smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days from the time they were surveyed.
While Harvard celebrates a lower smoking average, the IOP’s survey results hinted at other trends that are perhaps more troubling, if not entirely surprising. About 64 percent of the respondents indicated that they have friends who currently smoke and about 53 percent of students have family members who smoke or have smoked. People are more likely to smoke if they are surrounded by friends or acquaintances who smoke.
The Group’s survey also found that the majority of Harvard smokers began smoking when they were 17 or 18, right around the age when most reached college. This indicates that Harvard’s social pressures and stressful environment may be enough to drive many students to smoking, especially if many regard it as a socially acceptable outlet for stress.
To properly address smoking issues on campus, and to support those students who need it, Harvard needs to focus on publicizing already-existing smoking cessation resources and look into establishing prevention programs. Alcohol and sexual health resources are widely available and advertised throughout campus, and there is no reason why tobacco support should not receive the same attention.
Furthermore, incoming freshman receive a lot of information regarding alcohol and sexual resources during their first week on campus. Freshmen should be aware of healthier ways to deal with stress before they turn to smoking. Likewise, freshmen who already smoke would benefit from knowing of the preexisting smoking cessation resources available to them should they choose to quit.
To be sure, the majority of smokers are likely aware of the risks and dangers associated with smoking. About 66 percent of surveyed students indicated they have taken a class or program on the dangers of smoking, such as Drug Abuse Resistance Education. These students are within their rights to continue to smoke at Harvard, where appropriate. The stigma surrounding smoking needs to be reduced so that smokers who want to quit feel more comfortable and less judged when they come forward.
A smoking-wide ban, though ideal for some, would also do little to help Harvard smokers. The emphasis should be on supporting existing smokers and creating ways to prevent those at risk from taking up the habit in the first place. As the Tobacco Control Policy Group’s survey indicated, many Harvard students are acquainted with smokers and it is easy to consider smoking a stress-reliever when surrounded by other smokers.
The Tobacco Control Policy Group’s survey may have revealed that the majority of Harvard students do not smoke, but this does not indicate that smoking is not a serious campus issue. Harvard’s social pressures and stressful environment likely perpetuate smoking habits. Focusing on prevention and proactive solutions to helping smokers kick the habit is sure to be a challenge, but it is a more viable solution than simply outlawing smoking or ostracizing smokers. Tobacco is the enemy, not smokers, and Harvard’s regulations should reflect that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a special canon of quotes for graduation season. Emerson, Churchill, Roosevelt (Eleanor), Angelou—they populate the greeting card aisle and countless commencement speeches. Though famous to the point of being cliché, they still have the power to uplift. But one has become perhaps the most famous. It is that of Henry David Thoreau, Class of 1837: “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.”
Note to Hallmark (and my fellow seniors): Thoreau, I believe, got it all backward.
Let me explain.
As we approach commencement, the Class of 2011 is torn between anxious anticipation of what is to come and warm reflection on our years here. And as we relive our best Harvard moments, it is worth considering them in light of those words of Thoreau’s. (After all, at least one relative will send a card emblazoned with his words.)
So, think about it: How many of those great moments did we actually imagine before arriving on campus? How many of our best Harvard experiences did we foresee? Are we sad to leave because our time here was exactly what we imagined four years ago, or is it because it defied expectations? On reflection, the brightest of the bright spots are, more often than not, those that were unexpected, undreamed, and unimagined.
But it is not just seniors who should know this by now. Harvard has taught us all something—whether we recognize it or not: Reject notions like Thoreau’s. (One wonders if he truly believed what he said, anyway. Are we really to picture an 18-year-old Thoreau lying awake at night in Hollis imagining an ascetic life on Walden Pond that would inspire a literary masterpiece? I doubt it.) Expectations rarely align with reality. When Al Gore ’69 arrived on campus, he planned to be a novelist. Author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Class of 1829, expected to be a lawyer. Bill Gates planned to graduate.
Conversely, a senior’s bout of nostalgia also provokes thoughts of what we missed—of opportunities passed over, of times we chose to follow carefully laid plans. Maybe it was a missed chance to be inspired by an intellectual luminary. Maybe it was a missed chance to deepen a relationship. Now, this is no time for regrets, but each of us has them. We know what they are. And how many were caused by our own refusal to deviate from the path we imagined—our insistence on adhering to carefully laid plans?
The fact remains, though: We like predictability. We like pre-planned order. It’s our nature. We often reject the present possibilities of a new opportunity when it just does not fit with the unguaranteed future we have crafted in our minds.
Perhaps it is because we are told to do so. We are told to follow our dreams, to follow our imaginations. In other words, we are encouraged to base today on the future. But when we do this—when we commit ourselves to dreams, expectations, the imagined life Thoreau had in mind—we lose a certain license for liberation. We miss out on the sorts of things that create much-treasured memories. Clinging to overly imagined dreams can be just as self-defeating as utter apathy. We do not live life, but rather pass through it—refusing detours or sudden turns away from the destination we’ve imagined.
Instead, we would be better advised to do the opposite: Rather than basing today on the future, base the future on today. We should not let our future determine what we do today; we should let today determine our future. And to do that, we must open up. We must forget about playing it safe. We must value the possibilities of unimagined present happiness more than we value the security of an imagined future.
This is not to say stop dreaming altogether. That would be terribly uninspiring. But it is to say don’t let dreams become shackles. Don’t let your imagination blind you to better things. It is not a failure to deviate from the grand narrative arc that we have constructed for our lives; in fact, if we think about it, we might realize it is in so deviating that we are more likely to find our greatest happiness and perhaps even our greatest successes. We should free ourselves for success. We should remember the lesson we have learned here. Those of us leaving campus and those of us returning should endeavor equally to live more and dream less.
So, a new version of Thoreau’s words is in order. It is perhaps literary “civil disobedience” to suggest as much, but I think Thoreau of all people would understand.
And that version goes something like this: Go confidently in any direction. Live the life you never imagined.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent study out of the University of California, Berkeley on “Keeping Women in the Science Pipeline” found that one of the reasons many women graduate students leave research careers is because paid parental leave after the birth of a child is so difficult for graduate students to obtain. Only 13 percent of universities provide at least 6 weeks of paid maternity leave to graduates, while 58 percent of them provide the same to faculty members. We might assume that Harvard, as one of the leading research institutions in the country, places a high premium on training the best and brightest PhD students, both men and women, for promising academic careers. We might assume that Harvard must be among that 13  percent. But we would be wrong. And among our peer institutions of MIT, Caltech, Princeton, Stanford, Yale, Cornell, and Dartmouth, Harvard remains the only university in the group that does not grant the basic benefit of six weeks paid leave to graduate student mothers. In fact, while we should expect Harvard’s support of graduate student parents to be commensurate with the quality of its research programs, we might make the argument instead that Harvard is one of the most difficult research institutions at which to be a graduate student parent.
A 2008 GSAS study of graduate student parents found that graduate student mothers bore the primary responsibilities for childcare in the months after the birth of a child: more than half (55 percent) of the spouses of Harvard graduate mothers stayed home for four weeks or less, while only two percent of the spouses of Harvard graduate fathers stayed home for four weeks or less. The burden of childcare is undeniably borne more heavily by the women graduate students. This statistic is reflected in the findings of the UC Berkeley study that determined that tenured women professors in science are three times more likely to be single without children than their male counterparts (25 percent versus nine percent). The 2005 Harvard Task Force on Women in Science and Engineering similarly concluded that in order “to encourage more women to pursue academic careers, Harvard should explore more ways to make it financially and logistically possible for female doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows to have children”. The link between retaining talented women in academia and providing adequate childcare support is evident, and Harvard is currently providing no financial support whatsoever for graduate mothers.
In addition to the lack of any GSAS-wide maternity leave policy, Harvard has a number of childcare assistance programs for faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows that are inaccessible to graduate student parents. These programs include the Ladder Access childcare scholarship program, childcare scholarships for Harvard, the Dependent Care Fund for Short-Term Professional Travel, and a back-up and emergency care program. While there existed a pilot program through the Office of Work/Life Resources to provide scholarships to graduate students whose children were enrolled in Harvard affiliated childcare centers for a short while, graduate students are no longer eligible to apply for these scholarships. The current status of childcare assistance at Harvard leaves graduate students with extremely limited resources for childcare in an environment which is, in contrast, so supportive of faculty and staff parents.
In the absence of any improvements to parental leave policy or childcare accommodations for graduate students, the GSAS administration has made strides in communicating to students the policy of stopping the G-clock, the administration’s measurement of a student’s progress through graduate school. The GSAS bulletin for February of 2011 publicized this avenue for graduate students, which allows parents to pause the G-clock for a year and maintain their eligibility for grants and teaching appointments. In practice, only 20 percent of GSAS parents took advantage of the G-clock stopping policy (per the 2008 survey), and hopefully more students do so now; the alternate route of taking an official leave of absence means that students may lose eligibility for precious health insurance resources at Harvard. However, Harvard simply must go further to meet the needs of graduate parents. The same article in the bulletin restated the university’s current rationale for the lack of other action on behalf of graduate student parents, though they are aware of the issues at stake; the need for “continuing fiscal restraint” prevents any progress. But we must take notice of the status of parental leave programs at other universities in the current financial climate: Those policies have stayed firmly in place; and even the University of California, Berkeley has maintained six weeks of paid maternity leave for doctoral students, despite being a publicly funded university within a state in the midst of a severe budget crisis.
It is of the utmost importance to bring attention to this gaping hole in Harvard’s support of its graduate students. As one of the best research institutions in the country, Harvard is far, far behind its peers in granting this basic accommodation, which is so pivotal in particular to the careers of women graduate students. We call on the Harvard administration to reconsider the action items for outstanding needs of GSAS parents as proposed by the 2008 report: paid maternity leave and adequate childcare are simply essential to the mission of promoting the best possible research environment at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten dollars can buy a variety of things in Harvard Square: one t-shirt from the bargain basement at Urban Outfitters, two burritos, six cups of coffee, or ten copies of Spare Change newspaper. It is also the amount seniors are asked to give to “Senior Gift,” the Class of 2011’s combined contribution to the Harvard College Fund. HCF raises current-use money which goes wherever it is needed most, whether that be financial aid or maintaining the Malkin Athletics Center.
Senior gift, in general, is a good idea. Harvard College is an institution worthy of our support because it largely succeeds as a mechanism for social justice. By the numbers, few schools do as much to empower the middle and working classes. Harvard has embarked on an ambitious financial aid initiative that has brought scholarship to portions of the population that only decades ago were nearly shut out of higher education. Harvard’s broad financial aid program, which strives to prevent students from graduating indebted, has combated the recent hyperinflation of college fees that has mired many young students in debt and forced others away from college completely. Harvard not only promotes socioeconomic mobility but it provides young people who will surely become leaders of industry and politics with valuable critical-thinking skills and exposure to peers from different backgrounds.
Nevertheless there are, of course, arguments against giving to the College. Some people are hesitant to give because of negative experiences during their four years here. Indeed, the Class of 2010 at Dartmouth achieved a 99.9 percent participation rate, with the one holdout being a student who wrote that she did not believe that Darmouth provided a net positive experience to its undergraduates. Additionally, some wish to give to causes that work for social justice in different ways than Harvard does, such as the Red Cross or Oxfam. Others may find it very difficult to give $10. These reasons are personal and legitimate, so no one should ever be harassed into giving to Senior Gift.
This seems obvious, but the line between positive recognition and excessive pestering can be difficult to define. While it is okay to list the names of students who have donated in a House dining hall, it is not okay to sit outside a dining hall with the names of students who have not given and entreat them to when they swipe in for dinner. While it is okay to poster the doors of students who have donated, it is not okay to ask their roommates to join them to give. In the end, it is the attitude that giving is a choice, not a duty that makes Senior Gift a positive experience for all involved.
A separate issue is the stratification of seniors into regular donors—who give $10—and those in the Associates Program—who give $250 or above. Simply put, this program should not exist. The ability to give $250 as a college student with no income largely reflects one’s pre-Harvard financial background. It is strange that the College tries its utmost to erase socioeconomic barriers within the student body, through financial aid, making all students buy a full meal plan, providing grants for the summer, and in numerous other ways, yet condones a program of divided undergraduate years. This program is particularly harmful because it is implemented at the end of senior year, at a time when students are especially anxious over their career, and possibly making life choices that will yield them less money than their peers. While we understand the value of stratified giving after college, where it is a useful tool for rewarding those who will make big gifts to the school, one’s four years at Harvard should remain sealed off from these realities as much as possible.

Despite being a Harvard College alumnus, Charles D. Ravenel ’61 does not have his undergraduate diploma hanging on his office wall. Instead, his eight-and-a-half by eleven sheet of paper, declaring the completion of his studies at Harvard, lies tucked away out of view.
Like many of his peers, Ravenel was upset by the College’s decision to change diplomas from the traditional Latin to English—a switch that set off a flurry of lighthearted but sincere protest in the spring of 1961.
“It was so unseemly for the dignity and history of Harvard,” Ravenel says. “It certainly wasn’t something graceful, something stately, or something worth putting on the wall.”
A RESOUNDING ‘NO’
The news that the Class of 1961 would be the first class to be given English diplomas was not well received. On Wednesday, April 26, 1961, the change incited more than 2,000 students to crowd the steps of Widener Library. The next night, The Crimson reported that nearly 4,000 boisterous students showed up—though participants remember far fewer.
After hearing the news that the diplomas would be changed, as the first class marshal, Ravenel was approached by numerous students disconcerted by the change in tradition. Ravenel attended a meeting with University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 on behalf of students to voice their concerns.
Ravenel recalls the meeting as wholly unproductive. After proposing a number of ideas to Pusey, including having seniors opt to pay for traditional diplomas—which, in addition to being written in Latin, were larger and more elaborately printed—Ravenel left with a resounding “no” ringing in his ears.
“He wanted complete control,” Ravenel says. “He wouldn’t budge an inch, and no one could stop him.”
The Crimson reported at the time that Pusey believed issuing diplomas in Latin would be hypocritical given that Latin neither remained a requirement for Harvard undergraduates, nor was it any longer the universal language of academia. But a number of students also say that they suspect the cost of diplomas played a large role.
LATIN SI, PUSEY NO
Few undergraduates found Pusey’s answers satisfactory, and rumblings of discontent continued to grow in the days after the announcement was made. A group of students hung a sign from their Leverett House window declaring: “We Want Latin,” and petitions gathered several hundred signatures in support of the tradition.
“It wasn’t just an English diploma, but a really silly looking English diploma that was not in keeping with what a Harvard graduate should look like,” Michael Abbell ’61 says.
The dissatisfied students soon became restless.
“We decided we wanted someone to put some pressure on President Pusey,” Ravenel says.
Student annoyance culminated in a protest that lasted three days before finally losing momentum.
On the first day, as students cried “Latin si, Pusey no,” on the steps of Widener Library, crowds gathered as Phillip A. Stone ’62 gave a speech in Latin in favor of keeping the traditional diplomas.
But Pusey had his own witty retort.
In response to the frustrated mass of undergraduates, the University president delivered a poem:
“What’s pat in Latin
Or chic in Greek
I always distinguish
More clearly in English.”
The words did little to quiet the students, however, as the protest gathered force on Friday, bringing even more students to the Yard—much to the chagrin of University administrators.
Ultimately, as the crowd continued to grow despite efforts to avoid conflict, the police were called in to disperse the students, reportedly using tear gas and smoke bombs.
‘TONGUE AND CHEEK’
Students, who viewed the protest as peaceful and all in good fun, were offended by the use of force, recalling that the administration did not seem to understand the nonthreatening nature of the demonstrations.
“I think there were very few people who really cared but it seemed like something to make a fuss about,” Elliot S. Gershon ’61 says. “I think the weather was good and people needed a break.” Gershon also says he suspects that for a few students “a couple of glasses of wine” might have played a large part in the outcry.
“It was pretty much a tongue and cheek riot—if you want to call it a riot,” Abbell adds.
But many of those involved also feel as though their protest was not without significance.
“We wanted to make our unhappiness known and we did very elegantly, I think,” Paul M. Meo ’61 says. “It was in the spirit of fun and Pusey shouldn’t have unleashed the police on us, but he did.”
With the arrival of the police, Meo, who describes himself as “perhaps more excitable than others,” led a charge over the fence to Pusey’s residence, where he was cornered after throwing bread at responding officers.
“In those days things were handled much less bureaucratically,” Meo says. “So I wasn’t officially arrested but you can imagine what my parents thought when they opened the Boston Globe a few weeks before my graduation and saw their son being led away by the cops.”
RESIGNED TO ENGLISH
In spite of the run-in with the police, Meo was still allowed to graduate without severe punishment. However, the bottom of Meo’s transcript now has a small caveat: it states that he was officially admonished by the University for behavioral misconduct.
“Luckily it was so small that no one really noticed it,” Meo says.
After the raucous weekend it became clear to students that the diplomas they were to receive would remain in English. Their displeasure had been noted and there was nothing left for them but to move forward and collect their “less than handsome” certificates, as Ravenel calls them.
“We raised a bit of hell,” Meo says. “But compared to what happened [later] in the ’60s this was a very mild protest indeed.”
Although the graduates were later offered an updated version of the diploma—still in English, but more like the former Latin version in appearance—many graduates chose to keep the diplomas they had received at Commencement.
“It was sort of a trophy in its sense of uniqueness,” Abbell says.
“I’m tempted to buy an old diploma off of eBay and change the name and date,” Ravenel says. “Just redo the damn thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 1960 presidential race between John F. Kennedy ’40 and Richard M. Nixon proved to be a turning point in U.S. politics. With the first televised presidential debate on Sept. 26, 1960, youth became a more prominent feature of American politics, as a candidate’s youthful apperance served as a marker of vitality readily visible to the American public via television sets.
“Television was not full color widescreen and all this kind of stuff,” says Roger M. Leed ’61, then a member of the Harvard Democrats, who watched the debate on campus.
But even on the black and white screen, Kennedy outshone Nixon, whose haggard look and five o’clock shadow reinforced the perception of the older Nixon relative to the youthful Kennedy. Of course, Nixon had been ill just a few days prior and had not fully recovered, nor did Nixon attempt to use makeup to improve his appearance.
“I just thought he looked that way,” Leed says.
Joel F. Henning ’61, who also watched the televised debate, recalls, “Kennedy came across as a much more attractive figure, both physically attractive and in that he was much more eloquent. He made a stark contrast both physically and stylistically to Nixon.”
But those who heard the debate on the radio rather than watching it on television generally believed Nixon trumped Kennedy in the debate, a fact often used to symbolize the television’s growing impact on politics.
Regardless of medium, Kennedy’s popularity among students might have had more to do with his alma mater than with his campaign platform.
“I would say [the political climate on campus] wasn’t so much clearly left-wing, but I think it was clearly pro-Kennedy,” Henning says.
Thomas M. Pepper ’61 agrees, saying Nixon did not stand a chance against Kennedy on the popularity scale.
“Students were predominantly Democratic party adherents. They had this romance with Kennedy.” Pepper recollects. “Nobody liked Nixon. Even Republicans didn’t really like him. He wasn’t quote ‘cool.’ There he was on TV sweating ... Everyone wanted to be like Kennedy.”
Coming out of the McCarthyist 1950s, the specter of communism still loomed over Harvard Yard.
“Sputnik occurred in the fall of ’57.” Pepper reminisces. “It was a big shock: ‘how could the Russians be ahead of us [in the space race]?’ So the big issue was the Soviet Union versus us.”
But despite Nixon’s fervent anticommunism, Leed says that the fear of communism did not permeate the student body.
“They didn’t take this Red Scare nonsense,” Leed says. “We were aware the Russians had atomic weapons, but nobody thought someone was going to take over the U.S. government from within.”
Henning agrees with Leed, saying students generally disapproved of “hysterical anticommunism.”
“I think there was generally a sense of revulsion to the general McCarthy-like, Nixon-like focus on finding communists under every bed and in every department of the government,” Henning notes.
With topics such as civil rights growing more and more contentious, students generally thought that the election of Kennedy could bring about the major changes they sought.
“People bought into the idea that maybe we could actually change something about the country,” Henning says. “People were interested in new political stuff nationally. I think Kennedy’s candidacy provided an outlet.”
But even Kennedy faced his own hurdles to election, among them his Catholicism—Kennedy is the only Catholic President.
“Prior to Kennedy, the idea of a Catholic being elected President was pretty far-fetched,” Henning notes.
Kennedy won the electoral vote over Nixon 303 to 219, though the margin of the popular vote was within .1 of a percent.
By inauguration day in the winter of 1961, Kennedy’s boyish bravado had instilled a sense of optimism in many students and throughout the nation, according to Henning.
“Kennedy represented youth, a breakthrough with regard to giving voice to people previously unrepresented at the highest level of government,” Henning says.
Even after his election, Kennedy continued to inspire Harvard’s student body, particularly in his call to service as embodied in his famous inauguration speech.
“It had an impact on me because I up and joined the Peace Corps,” Leed says, “Most people bought into that. We were waiting to hear something like that. That was a real watershed time in America.”

When Hobart G. Armstrong Jr. ’63 donned his helmet and his #40 Crimson jersey to step onto Soldiers Field in 1961, he was the only black man on the football team. When Spencer C.D. Jourdain ’61 sang in harmony with his fellow Harvard Glee Club members, what made him stand out amongst his peers wasn’t the color of his crimson suit jacket, but the color of his skin.
Although there were roughly six black undergraduates in the Class of 1961, black students didn’t always experience the discrimination that some might expect would accompany their minority status.
With lingering ’50s-era McCarthyism and Cold War fears continuing to suppress outspoken activism, the year 1961 signaled a relative lull in civil rights protest at Harvard, as black students became involved in extracurricular activities and felt integrated in the broader college community. Although many say they did not experience significant discrimination at Harvard, growing racial tension off-campus would slowly raise awareness of racial issues among students, eventually igniting vibrant student activism in the late ’60s.
MCCARTHYISM LINGERS ON
On Harvard’s campus, the ’50s and early ’60s served as a period of relative silence on civil rights before activism boomed in the later ’60s.
“Civil rights was just a topic among topics,” Jourdain says. “It certainly wasn’t the dominant issue at the time.”
But just a few decades earlier, Jourdain’s father Edwin Bush Jourdain, Jr. ’21 had spearheaded the movement to desegregate the dorms during his own time at Harvard.
“It was very different than the ’20s, when among the African-American students, [race] was a vociferous issue,” Spencer Jourdain says. “But in the ’50s and early ’60s among students and even African-American students, it was not nearly as intense.”
Wandering the aisles of the activities fair during his freshman year in 1959, John N. Woodford ’63 was warned by his friends to think carefully about the student groups that he signed up for.
Rather than being concerned about him over-committing himself while adjusting to his new life at Harvard, Woodford says that his friends still held lingering concerns about the era of McCarthyism in which people who engaged in activism and anti-government activity were seen as suspect.
Some people still believed that associations with socialism or communism, even if only in the form of signing up for a student activist group’s list, could ruin their reputation and even their careers later on in life, Woodford says.
But the early ’60s marked a transition period between that fear of action—instilled in the American population by organizations such as the House Un-American Activities Committee—and the later activist generations that would risk both their position at the University and their lives in the fight for racial equality.
The mixture of these two mentalities meant that a slow but constant evolution into a new era marked the period.
“It was a mix of the dying ’50s and the emerging ’60s, so there were a lot of different currents at the time,” Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92 says.
BEYOND RACIAL BOUNDARIES
But a hesitance to engage in activism did not translate into discrimination on campus.
Scanning the Freshman Union, one could easily spot the crew team and the football players, but the table that stood out the most to many was that filled with black students, Woodford says. But he adds that this group would also welcome other students and did not feel they were unwelcome elsewhere.
Most black students spent a significant amount of time with other black students, but they maintained close relationships with students of other races without concerns about racial differences.
Harvey Pressman, a white graduate student who graduated in 1964, says that race was on the backburner when he became close friends with an African-American student in his class.
“We thought of him more as a lousy second baseman than an African American,” Pressman says.
But the weekends led to more distinct racial separations as students spent time outside of the classroom.
“The only place that I was ever aware of difference—although it didn’t really affect me—but black students were not invited to the clubs, or at least barely any were,” Jourdain says.
His freshman year, Armstrong lived in Pennypacker 48, along with another black student Lowell S. Davidson ’63 and white students Philip A. Cromer ’63 and Franklin J. Bardacke ’63.
“It was an uptight place,” Bardacke says, referring to Harvard. “People weren’t really looking for change because they weren’t that unhappy with what it was.”
For Jourdain and Armstrong, their involvement in student groups gave them a strong sense of belonging, despite being in the extreme minority.
“Football was a team effort,” Armstrong says. “There was no discrimination that I could perceive.”
Similarly, Jourdain described his time on the Glee Club as the highlight of his Harvard experience.
“It connected me to the richest traditions and history of Harvard,” Jourdain says. “It was a deep and profound experience.”
Even without discriminatory practices or racial antagonism, events that seemed small to other students sometimes stood out in the minds of black students as they reinforced the continued existence of racial differences.
“One of our classmates was doing a paper on [African Americans],” Woodford says. “So if we didn’t think of ourselves as some kind of group or entity, it was kind of forced upon us once we saw that they were studying us.”
But rather than being irritated or insulted by this assignment, Woodford says that he and most of his black friends saw it as absurd and entered interviews with the writer with an attitude that made light of the project.
‘HOTBED OF REST’
Woodford had grown up in Benton Harbor, Mich., an “apple pie, Chevrolet, all-American town” where he attended an integrated school and had not experienced significant first-hand discrimination despite his African-American heritage.
However, when he traveled to Washington, D.C. with high school friends to attend an amusement park after his senior year in high school, he found that he was denied entry to the park because of his race.
After this, Woodford found that he had a personal connection to the movement for racial equality, which drove him to get involved with the cause.
“Since I had been barred from that amusement park, I kind of felt immediately that I had been involved with [the civil rights movement] and maybe if I hadn’t, then it might have felt unnatural or like someone else’s problem,” Woodford says.
It was these first-person encounters with systematized racism that drove Woodford to take up the cause of racial equality. As an undergraduate, he and a fellow student picketed locations of Woolworth’s, a national department store chain with segregated locations in the South.
But not all students on campus carried the same passion for civil rights activism, leading Pressman to describe the atmosphere as a “hotbed of rest.”
For Jourdain, attending Harvard was less of a social statement than an opportunity.
“That was the mindset of our class,” Jourdain says. “We were there to get an education and then to go out and be successful people in our chosen fields, not start a cohesive social movement.”
While growing unrest in the South slowly brought news of boycotts and eventually the Freedom Rides in 1961, Harvard students often were not entirely aware of what was going on 1,000 miles to the south. Ganz says that not all Harvard students were aware of the extent of segregation in the South and the problems it created.
“When you come from very privileged backgrounds you don’t see the world that way and you have to be confronted with it,” Ganz says. “Retrospectively, we kind of look back at that era and say it looks obvious that racial segregation should end, but it wasn’t obvious to most people at all, even in a place like Harvard.”
For Ganz, it was not a specific incident that convinced him he could no longer stand on the sidelines. Inspired by people his own age leading the movement in the South, Ganz left Harvard to head to the South himself and campaign for civil rights.
Ganz says that many of his peers would publicly assert their belief in racial justice, but only a few were “really putting their lives on the line to change things. It forced you to examine yourself and say, ‘Are these values real to me and are they enough to make me act?’”
As civil rights began to inspire activism throughout the nation, the climate on campus slowly began to evolve.
“Was it a huge conflagration? Well, no. But the flames were sure flickering,” Ganz says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1961, the College was in the midst of planning Project Tanganyika, a program that would eventually send 20 Harvard and Radcliffe College students to teach in secondary schools in Africa over the summer.
Project Tanganyika was intended to be one of many future trips offered by the Harvard African Teaching Prospect, a Harvard-sponsored program that would organize Harvard student volunteer efforts in Africa.
But at the time, Harvard was not alone in looking to international service.
The Peace Corps, like the Harvard African Teaching Prospect, was conceived of after World War II in order to cultivate cultural exchange and provide a forum in which American youths could dedicate themselves to a constructive cause.
On March 1, 1961, President John F. Kennedy ’40 signed Executive Order 10924 providing for the temporary establishment and administration of the Peace Corps.
“The Peace Corps and the first volunteers were going overseas” the following summer, according to Stephen C. Clapp ’60, a former Crimson Editorial Chair who joined the Peace Corps shortly after his graduation.
Now in its 50th year, the Peace Corps currently assists in 77 nations and counts 8,655 individuals as part of its volunteer efforts.
But in 1961, as public support for the nascent Peace Corps grew, the fate of the comparable Harvard program dimmed as the energy of the Harvard-based program flowed directly into the development of the Peace Corps. Because the individuals who drove the development of the Peace Corps and the Harvard African Teaching Prospect were often one and the same, the two separate programs were deeply intertwined.
CREATION OF THE CORPS
When Kennedy announced the creation of the Peace Corps in March 1961, students involved in Project Tanganyika were vigorously fundraising and memorizing conjugations in Swahili.
Fifty undergraduates had applied to teach English in Nigeria during the following summer as part of the Harvard program—a smaller pool than the 370 upperclassmen that expressed interest when polled in the fall of 1960.
But within a week of the Corps’ creation, Dean of the College John U. Monro ’35 suggested that the Peace Corps could ultimately subsume part or all of the Harvard African Teaching Prospect.
Discussions on how to implement the Harvard African Teaching Prospect were stalled as Monro pushed for further understanding of the relationship between the Peace Corps and its comparable Harvard program.
Rather than compete with the Peace Corps, Harvard assisted in the planning and implementation of the program.
Monro travelled to Washington, D.C. three times in April to meet with representatives of other universities and heads of government foundations about the initial planning of the Peace Corps.
John D. Rockefeller IV ’61 was selected, prior to his graduation, to serve on a 33-member Peace Corps advisory council, where his colleagues included calypso singer Harry Belafonte and former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
And other students demonstrated their interest in the Peace Corps’ ultimate definition by creating campus committees such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Committee for a Youth Service Program, which aimed to raise interest in youth service abroad and explore the prospect of setting up a national program.
A CULT OF PUBLIC SERVICE
Many attribute the excitement and fervor surrounding the development of the Peace Corps and the Harvard African Teaching Prospect to Kennedy himself.
At a National Conference on Youth Service Abroad meeting in D.C. on March 29, 1961, Kennedy praised the country’s youth for their initial enthusiasm for the Peace Corps, challenging them to pursue “a new era of American pioneering” by carving out a space in service.
Steven V. Roberts ’64 recently wrote a review of Stanley Meisler’s “When the World Calls: The Inside Story of the Peace Corps and Its First Fifty Years,” in which he characterized the Peace Corps as a symbol of Kennedy that impacted even non-volunteers in its call for service.
Roberts—now a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University—recalls his time at Harvard as being defined and shaped by Kennedy, whose inauguration and assassination bookended his time on campus.
What Roberts calls “the cult of public service” was a value system that profoundly impacted his collegiate life and those of his peers, many of whom went into public service careers.
“I knew hardly anybody who was interested in going to Wall Street, making money, going into business or anything like that,” he says. “The values that were most honored, the peer pressure that was most tangible, the goals that were most admired in that place at that time were to in some way or another be part of the public policy and political process.”
But Kennedy was not single-handedly responsible for the public service fervor at the time. The energy of the civil rights movement and the international focus in the wake of World War II also shaped and inspired the nation to which Kennedy spoke.
“It was JFK who had the vision and courage to call for the Peace Corps,” writes Craig K. Comstock ’61, a former Crimson news editor who helped organize the Harvard-Radcliffe Committee for a Youth Service Program, in an email. But “the Peace Corps did not spring out of nothing.”
THE REALITY ABROAD
But in the decades after Kennedy, this enthusiasm for public service would fade.
Peace Corps sign-ups at Harvard had dropped 20 percent between 1964 and 1965—in the Class of 1964, 125 students entered the Peace Corps, but the number of applicants dropped to 97 in 1965.
In fact, the number of organization members abroad peaked just five years after the Corps’ inception with 15,556 volunteers.
“The spirit of Kennedy which burned so brightly in that time has for a variety of reasons faded,” Roberts explains, citing the disillusionment of young people with their government after the progression of the Vietnam War and, later, the Watergate scandal.
President Nixon opposed funding the project further, and subsequent presidents did little to ensure its success.
Controversy surrounding the enrollment in the Peace Corps as a potential method of draft dodging and threats of communist influences also cast a shadow over Kennedy’s original vision.
Dissatisfaction with volunteer experiences abroad was a factor too, especially for volunteers in less-established programs in areas such as Central America.
Clapp, who taught English in a secondary school in a remote town in northern Nigeria, says that “the Peace Corps was very much finding its way at this point.”
“We were expected to live like our host-country counterparts,” explains Clapp, who lived the life of a normal civil servant in Nigeria, occupying faculty housing, hiring servants, and enjoying recreational games of tennis and snooker.
THE PEACE CORPS TODAY
Now in its 50th year, the Peace Corps is getting as much media attention for its failures as for its successes. The Corps sent 7,671 volunteers abroad in 2009, about half the number of those it sent abroad in 1966. Of late, the program has been weighed down by accusations of dealing insufficiently with instances of rape of female volunteers.
A 1961 Crimson editorial laments that the Peace Corps serves only undeveloped countries in lieu of suffering individuals in the United States.
“The institution that I think exists today that in many ways has tapped into the idealism of the Peace Corps is Teach for America,” says Roberts, remarking that many more of his students apply to TFA than to the Peace Corps. He credits TFA’s higher interest on college campuses to TFA’s youth, its effective recruiting, and its unique appeal.
“I also think in a larger sense that to students looking out at the world and saying we’re going to make a difference, teaching in Oakland or Houston seems a more possible place for now than Tanzania or Botswana,” Roberts says.
Despite its imperfections, Roberts sees the Peace Corps as “a critical example of doing it right,” serving both those in need and those who volunteer with the organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With bomb shelters, numerous protests for disarmament, and the beginnings of the Vietnam War, in 1961 the Cold War was hard to forget even within the gates of Harvard. Just four years after Sputnik was launched into orbit by the Soviet Union, the American imagination was filled with questions about the communist nation across the Atlantic.
“It was the height of the Cold War,” says Richard E. Pipes, professor of history, emeritus. “Everyone was curious as to what was going on in Russia.”
At Harvard, curiosity was turned into a meaningful intellectual exchange with professors at the University of Leningrad. However, even with some interactions, what interested many—the politics of the day—stayed largely off the table, even in the classroom.
PLANNING AN EXCHANGE
In 1958, William S.B. Lacy, President Eisenhower’s Special Assistant on East-West Exchanges, and Georgi Z. Zarubin, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, negotiated an agreement to help facilitate a cultural exchange between the United States and the USSR.
Then in the summer of 1959, Dean of Faculty McGeorge Bundy met with a group of Harvard professors including Pipes to begin planning an ongoing exchange between Harvard professors and those at the University of Leningrad.
“The idea was seen as a good step forward and away from the Cold War,” Pipes says.
Following the discussion with Bundy, the first Harvard professor went to the USSR to deliver a series of lectures in the fall of 1960. Seymour Slive, a fine arts professor, arrived in Leningrad to speak on 17th-century Dutch painting. Four more professors visited the USSR during the ’60-’61 school year.
In the same year, five professors arrived at Harvard from the University of Leningrad, with expertise in a wide variety of disciplines from law to history and the sciences.
The visitors stayed in their host country for periods of several weeks—though their arrival date was not known by Harvard officials until they were notified of visa filings by immigration authorities.
“In the days of the Soviet Union, Western and Eastern scientists mingled freely and in a friendly manner,” says Richard M. Goody, one of the professors who lectured in the USSR, in an email. “In the sciences it was a mingling based on mutual respect for the other’s achievements.”
AVOIDING THE QUESTION
But academic achievements were clearly separated from discussions of politics or the daily realities of life in the respective countries.
“When in Russia, we were treated like princes, and were clearly not participating in normal Soviet life.” Goody writes. “When you did meet normal Soviet life it could be pretty frustrating, and I sometimes felt it to be threatening. There was always tension—until you passed the final security barrier on the way out.”
But many cultural questions remained in spite of attempts to keep discussions as intellectual as possible.
“After my lecture the Russian students wanted to ask questions, but the professor in charge thought they better not, as they were questions of a provocative nature,” Pipes says. As a result, “the students would surround me after lectures to ask questions.”
Not only were conversations about politics avoided, but discussion actually carried consequences for those in the USSR and for the Soviet professors in America. For instance, Goody recounts a story of his good friend and Rector of the University of Leningrad, Kirill Kondratiev, who was reportedly too friendly to foreigners and was subsequently banned from traveling abroad for 15 years.
“We never discussed politics—that was too dangerous for our Russian colleagues,” Goody says.
“The ‘tiki’ or ‘silent ones’ were always there, somewhere. The slightest slip on their part could have consequences,” he adds, referring to the danger that Soviet professors’ actions might be reported to Russian intelligence services.
While back at Harvard, discussing politics did not carry the same severe consequences, but the discussion was still limited. Robert W. Back, a graduate student in Harvard’s Regional Studies-USSR program at the time, says he was frustrated even with the Russian language curriculum.
“The problem was it was all literature and no politics,” Back says. “But at the time we wanted to talk politics.”
“It was boring to be a student in Russian at Harvard because the conversation was all literature,” Back adds. “They couldn’t discuss politics to save their lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One Saturday night during his undergraduate years, Alan D. Croll ’61 remembers setting an alarm for 10:30 p.m. to ensure that his female visitor from Radcliffe College was out of his dorm room by 11 p.m.
“You did not want to be late,” Croll says. “There was absolutely no tolerance, and you would be on probation right away, first offense.”
When the Class of 1961 attended Harvard and Radcliffe, the University strictly enforced ‘parietal rules’ that discouraged private interaction between the Harvard men and the Radcliffe women.
In 1960, the birth control pill—an innovation that would revolutionize attitudes and approaches toward sex—was approved for contraceptive use.
Though the pill did not have a direct impact on Harvard life at first, the approval of the pill represents the beginning of Harvard’s gradual shift from the gender-segregated social scene of the 1950s and early ’60s to the more integrated, liberal environment of today.
THE BIRTH OF THE PILL
The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Enovid—the first brand of birth control pill—for the treatment of severe menstrual disorders in 1957, but it was not approved as an oral contraceptive until May 1960.
The pill, containing hormones that keep a woman’s ovaries from releasing eggs and thus preventing pregnancy, quickly grew in popularity. By 1967, more than 12.5 million women worldwide were on the pill, and by 1984, an estimated 50 to 80 million women worldwide took it regularly.
While the pill symbolized women’s ability to exercise autonomy over their bodies and have sex without reproductive consequences, it also became harder for women to refuse sex on the basis of the risk of pregnancy, according to History Professor Nancy F. Cott.
“It may have compelled women to engage in sexual activities so that they are not seen as prudes,” she says of the pill.
Men who were at the University at that time echoed Cott’s sentiment.
Joe, a ’61 graduate who asked that his real name not be used, says he believes the pill encouraged women to have more sex because it reduced some of the risk.
“Which was fine with me,” he says, “because I was very interested in having as much sex as I could.”
THE PILL ON CAMPUS
Despite the contraceptive’s national popularity, its role on Harvard’s campus was limited in those early days.
Ann M. Moore ’61 says she and her classmates did not talk about the pill.
“We didn’t discuss it beyond a very limited circle of really close friends,” she says, adding that she personally did not know of anyone who took the pill.
In fact, contraception only became legal in Massachusetts for all women in 1972, when the Supreme Court struck down the state law prohibiting the sale of contraceptives to unmarried women.
“The society held an idea that a nice girl would not get pregnant before marriage,” Moore says. “It was very shameful to get pregnant without getting married.”
Joe agrees that the pill did not affect his sexual life at Harvard.
“During my time at Harvard, I didn’t have any intercourse with a girl who was on the pill,” he says.
GENDER DISCREPANCY
In 1961, women were very much outnumbered on campus. The male to female ratio in the academic year 1960-1961 was 4 to 1, with 4,596 male undergraduates at Harvard and 1,154 females at Radcliffe College.
In every class, women were by far in the minority. The women lived only in the Radcliffe Quad, could not eat in Harvard Yard unless invited by a male student, and could not go into Lamont Library, according to Pamela J. Matz ’70-71, a research librarian at Widener Library.
Furthermore, the Radcliffe women practiced “gracious living,” which meant they could not wear shorts or jeans downstairs in the dormitory or out in the Quad after 5 p.m.. They were required to wear dresses or skirts to class except on the coldest days, when they were permitted to wear slacks, Moore says.
Moore, who attended a large, co-ed public high school in the Chicago suburbs, says she was not as happy socially in college as she was in high school.
“It did not have the same excitement or opportunities that co-ed public high schools or universities would have,” Moore says.
Harvard and Radcliffe were “quite independent” from each other socially, Croll says, adding that a lot of Harvard men preferred to date women from Wellesley or Simmons Colleges.
“There were not a lot of Harvard boys chasing Radcliffe girls,” he says, speculating that some of his peers may have been intimidated by the Radcliffe women.
Patricia D. Lemon ’61 says only a few of her friends at Radcliffe dated Harvard men, and their relationships tended to be largely sexual.
TALKING ABOUT SEX
Nonetheless, sex was a topic widely discussed among the male students at Harvard, students in the Class of ’61 say.
Though Croll says fewer people were sexually active because of parietal rules and other restrictions, he says that “Harvard boys talked about girls and sex a lot.”
On the other hand, conversation about sex was taboo at Radcliffe.
Moore says she focused more on her academics and rarely talked about sex-related issues with her peers, and Lemon adds that students were not able to bring up sex-related questions even with their House Mothers or House Masters.
“It was very hush-hush,” Lemon says.
Lemon adds that adults “very strongly discouraged male and female sexual activity,” and that the health center was the only available resource for women. She says it was also difficult for women to simply go to a physician and get advice about sex.
“They thought they were protecting us from the knowledge, but in fact, this lack of knowledge betrayed us,” Lemon says. “It put us in a position where we couldn’t take care of ourselves.”
Matz says that women still faced difficulties in attaining prescriptions for the pill from the University’s physicians even a decade after the pill’s approval. At that time, Matz and her fellow female students would share information about how best to obtain the pill.
“We discussed what kind of questions the doctors will ask you and whether or not you would have to wear a wedding ring,” she says.
LASTING IMPACT
In the opinion of some Radcliffe students, the pill changed their peer’s lives mostly after, rather than during, college, since at first many were remained cautious and hesitant about its use.
“A lot of women were waiting to see how the pill would turn out,” Moore says.
Croll also says that the pill had a much more gradual, cumulative effect on the changing culture of sex at Harvard and in the country more broadly.
“There was a bit of elation, invitation, and a step away from more Puritan values,” he says. “But women weren’t saying, ‘Let’s go to bed right away.’”
Although the lives of Radcliffe women might not have been strongly affected by the pill during college, the birth control pill did eventually have an impact on their lives.
After meeting her husband, Moore says her physician had prescribed her with a diaphragm as a birth control mechanism.
But because the diaphragm was ineffective, she became pregnant with her first child, Eric, within six months of her marriage.
“He came along because I didn’t go on the pill,” she says.
After the birth of her son in 1965, Moore switched to the pill as her birth control mechanism of choice.
MOVE TO EQUALITY
In the 1960s, the movement towards gender equality gained momentum, spurred by the independence offered to women with the advent of the pill.
“I think [the pill] was an important step in women’s movement in making them independent and equal,” Croll says.
The pill spurred the female push for equality by heightening gender differences, Matz adds.
It was this same movement that would ultimately have significant consequences for the structure of Harvard as a University.
In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe became one entity after the two schools signed an agreement that placed undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College.
Around the same time, the FDA reported that 10.7 million American women were on the pill.
Today, the prevalence of the pill is still widespread, including on Harvard’s campus.
David S. Rosenthal ’59, the director of University Health Services, says that many students come to campus already taking birth control pills and that UHS will facilitate these prescriptions being refilled. For students who wish to begin taking contraception in college, Rosenthal says they are able make an appointment with a clinician to discuss options.
The pill’s wide use can be attributed largely to its effectiveness. Fewer than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant each year if they always take the pill each day as directed, while about 9 out of 100 women get pregnant each year if they do not always take the pill each day as directed.
Despite the enormous changes of the last 50 years since the pill’s approval, Abby P. Sun ’13—former president of the female advocacy group Radcliffe Union of Students—says the fight for gender equality is ongoing.
“Something that we still have to contend with is that birth control and parenthood is thought to be the responsibility of women,” Sun says. “It should be among all parties involved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge of the 1950s was one of pastel homes alongside abandoned parking lots and a winding Charles River polluted with industrial run-off.
Although Cambridge is now a hub for technology and research, in the era after World War II but before the ’60s, the city was home to declining heavy industry and oil reserve tanks.
“It was an industrial wasteland,” says Joseph Tulimeiri, executive director of the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. “Just about every obnoxious industrial use that you can think of was in this area.”
As a result, people moved out, and after the end of WWII the city experienced a decline in population and industry.
In an attempt to counteract Cambridge’s deterioration, the city administration created the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority in the early ’60s, marking the beginning of urban renewal in Cambridge.
The end of WWII “coincided with the notion that you can and should reinvigorate urban context in very large parcels,” says Cambridge City Councilor Sam Seidel.
Following zoning amendments passed in the early ’60s, which permitted the construction of buildings by MIT and other organizations, Cambridge began its transformation from a decrepit industrial city to a revived research-focused one.
REVITALIZATION BEGINS
In response to the downward spiral in Cambridge following WWII, the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority approved the construction of Technology Square, built under the advising of a real estate agency, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, Inc, hired by MIT.
The city cleared off some land and built offices, research labs, and spaces for small businesses in the Kendall and Central Square areas.
The construction was intended to make the square “a much more attractive neighborhood for everybody to walk around,” Tulimeiri says.
The square was also intended to house the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) mission control center, considered the  epitome of technological advancement at the time.
By 1965, NASA had been granted permission to use nearly a third of the cleared property in Technology Square. But when President John F. Kennedy ’40 was assassinated, Technology Square’s face shifted.
“Cambridge, Mass. was Kennedy’s choice for NASA,” Seidel explains. But President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy’s successor, moved the NASA base to Houston, Texas, Johnson’s home state, leaving Technology Square with a large, vacated tract of land which was filled by other tenants.
Even though NASA’s intended entry was thwarted, other urban renewal projects spearheaded by the city revitalized Cambridge. According to Tulimeiri, the construction successfully improved the city’s tax income, job offerings, and aesthetics, and Cambridge became a more popular place to live.
By 1970, according to Charles M. Sullivan, executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission, the city had to introduce rent control to keep housing affordable after the influx of inhabitants.
HARVARD’S IMPACT
When Brian A. Thompson ’62 first came to Cambridge as a freshman at Harvard College, he remembers MIT as having “quite a bit of building going on.” But he remembers very few construction efforts at Harvard, recalling that most of Harvard Square’s transformation was to follow urban renewal efforts in other parts of Cambridge.
Harvard did still undergo some building efforts at the time. The Holyoke Center, in the heart of the Square, was opened for use in the early ’60s.
The University also bought the St. Paul’s church rectory and parking lot in order to change the rectory into a low income housing unit, according  to Thompson.
Harvard itself provides constancy to the state of the Square.
“Harvard’s footprint is important in Harvard Square,” Sullivan says.
NEW TOOLS, OLD PROBLEMS
Looking back on the urban renewal efforts of the ’60s, Seidel asserts that the focus of renewal has shifted somewhat.
“The vision of the physical space is absolutely different. Our understanding of what makes a good city is very different,” Seidel says. Unlike the previous emphasis purely on utility, “The focus [now] is on making places enjoyable.”
Even with this shift in emphasis, Sullivan says that Cambridge has been very successful in balancing industrial development and residential life.
“One of the things we’re finding out is that it does not make sense to do a lot of development without putting people in these places,” Seidel says. As a result, the city is currently examining how best to jointly incorporate apartment and office buildings into city plans.
“Cities will always change. The tools we use to change them will always change,” Seidel said. “Urban renewal was a tool that was used after WWII. [Now] we rely a lot more on the private sector.”
Despite the advancements of the ’60s, the Cambridge city renewal efforts are far from complete.
Tulimeiri says that there are about 1.5 million square feet of land that could be redeveloped further, noting that the abandoned parking lots have not all disappeared.
But throughout these renewal efforts, representatives of the city say they have always focused on protecting the character of Cambridge’s many neighborhoods.
“The main focus of the city is to protect its neighborhoods [while] at the same time creating an economic base that supports the programs the city has,” Sullivan says.
Nostalgically, Thompson remembers the Harvard Square that predates renewal efforts as being “a little funky.”
“You could get roast beef sandwich for 39 cents,” Thompson says.
But Thompson, who still lives in Cambridge, says the Square has since changed.
The sandwich shop, now gone, has been replaced by an ATM.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Michael S. Lottman ’61 transferred to Harvard, 1950s America was in full-swing. Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the civil rights movement was in its infancy, and Radcliffe women still had a curfew.
But during Lottman’s three years at Harvard, America was transitioning into a new era. Lottman—a former Crimson managing editor—would graduate into a changing world not quite culturally situated in the ’50s, but not fully in the ’60s either.
“When I was in school, I was totally oblivious to what was going on. A lot of us were,” he says. “It was a time of transition. I often thought, ‘I wish I had gone [to Harvard] a few years later.’”
But in this volatile time, Harvard administrators recognized a budding shift and sought to avoid becoming stagnant in the face of change. A short three months after Lottman’s class graduated, former Harvard Dean of Admissions Wilbur J. Bender ’27 declared in a report that Harvard should revise its admissions policies.
“Unless hereafter the steady stream of tuition increases slows down to what is justified by inflation, Harvard College will have to cut itself off from most of America,” Bender wrote in the report, which garnered national attention when it was released in Sept. 1961.
During the four years that the Class of 1961 spent as undergraduates, the College began to acknowledge the need to support socioeconomic and geographic diversity among the student body, a change indicated by the host of programs that, though young, were rapidly accelerating.
‘SCANDINAVIAN FARM BOYS’ AND ‘BRIGHT BRONX PREMEDS’
At first glance the figures from Bender’s report do not suggest that the College was becoming more exclusive, as more students of diverse backgrounds filed applications.
The total number of applications jumped from 3,602 for the Class of 1961 to 5,235 for the Class of 1964—an increase of 45 percent.
Furthermore, the total number of scholarship applicants rose by nearly 73 percent in that same period.
Students say they sensed that they were benefitting from a diverse class.
Christopher Wadsworth ’62 says that he had several roommates from the Midwest and enjoyed learning from their different perspectives, evidence of the increasing number of students from outside New England.
But looking closely at the numbers, Bender saw a different trend. His report noted that while on the whole the University was giving more financial aid, it largely benefitted students from upper middle class backgrounds rather than the genuinely poor who could not otherwise afford a Harvard education.
“In a decade of almost fantastic increase in our financial aid resources we were unable to increase significantly the proportion of the student body receiving financial aid from the College,” Bender wrote.
His 1961 report would serve as the basis of a change in philosophy that would distinguish the future classes from classes of the past.
“My prejudice is for a Harvard College with a certain range and mixture and diversity in its student body,” he said in the report. “A college with some snobs and some Scandinavian farm boys who skate beautifully and some bright Bronx premeds ...”
Today, University officials recognize Bender as the foundation of that shift from a predominantly upper middle class student body hailing from New England to a more diverse student body both socioeconomically and geographically.
“Students learn a great deal from one another in addition to what they get out of books and classes and the papers they write. That started in the ’50s with Bill Bender,” says former University President Derek C. Bok.
SMALL LOANS, BIG IDEAS
But while Bender and his ideas were ahead of their time in the world of college admissions, students themselves had already begun to make their own changes and lay the foundation for a more inclusive College.
Before Bender’s report, the Financial Aid Office struggled to find a practical answer to the question that Bender vocalized in 1961: With Harvard’s tuition on the rise, how could the University maintain and increase the social and economic diversity of its applicants?
Struck by the dorm room efforts of young entrepreneurs, then-Dean of Financial Aid John U. Monro ’35 assigned Director of Student Employment Dustin M. Burke ’52 to investigate student businesses as a mechanism for undergraduates to support themselves while on campus.
In response, Burke began the research that would culminate in the creation of Harvard Student Agencies, whose 1957 charter asserts that it serves “to conduct and supervise enterprises for the benefit of students at Harvard University who are in need of financial assistance to defray the expenses of their education.”
HSA became a major part of undergraduate financial support beyond what Harvard could lend to students through an aid program, Burke says.
Beginning in 1957 with a $7,000 investment and the acquisition of the rights to provide the weekly linen service customarily offered by the University, HSA quickly expanded to match student interest, providing funding to students who sought to start businesses of their own.
Although HSA began as an initiative of the Financial Aid Office, Burke stresses that its projects were founded and run by students.
“With a little selling knowledge and the genius nature of the student came the ability to find and start businesses,” Burke says. “We would give them a little desk and a telephone and leads to members of the community and alumni and it turned into a very active, positive group of people.”
Student employees became integrated in the Harvard community, serving hot dogs to eager peers at concession stands during Harvard football games and martinis to faculty during private parties.
And the growing number of relatively low-income students and their newfound position on campus were reflected in other ways.
“It really was a time when the social clubs were beginning to become more irrelevant to the vast majority of the students,” says Michael Churchill ’61, former managing editor of The Crimson.
Churchill says integration of social groups was “a long ways from where it was by the end of the ’60s.”
“There was in ’57 almost no attention being paid to racial or economic diversity,”
he says. “By ’61 that was beginning to change. By ’65 there was a complete transformation in students’ attention to those issues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 4, 1961, the Harvard varsity ice hockey team—the year’s Ivy League champions—sat in a silent locker room, bewildered by the 1-1 “upset tie” Yale had just handed them to end the season.
But the greatest disappointment was not a result of the team’s play on the ice.
Despite the squad’s posting an 18-4-2 record, the Faculty Committee on Athletics banned the team from taking part in the NCAA tournament for the second straight year. And once again the committee gave no official explanation for its actions.
Some speculated that it was caused by the losses against Boston College days before the prohibition was re-affirmed. And in a telegram message to the hockey team, then Associate Dean of the College and member of the committee Robert B. Watson ’37 bid the team to “prove you are of NCAA calibre.”
But in an unofficial capacity, school officials told the hockey team that the ban was a protest against the “professionalism in spirit” the committee saw in its opponents, particularly the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).
In response to the decision, the hockey team formed a special “fact-finding committee” under the Undergraduate Athletics Council to protest against the ban, according to hockey player David G. Morse ’62.
According to an anonymous committee member from a past Crimson interview, however, the faculty felt that it could make more progress on the situation without making its objections public or official.
BEHIND THE BAN
The problem, according to Morse, could be traced to the University of Denver—a member of the WCHA—where the school admitted heavily subsidized semi-professional athletes, many of whom were not full-time students. The NCAA determined that the University of Denver violated recruiting policies, and Harvard took a stance against its opponent’s admission strategy by banning the Crimson team from playing.
“If you look at the roster [of some WCHA teams], they did not have any American players,” says hockey team manager G. Neal Ryland ’63. “It was too much professionalism.”
But for the hockey team members who were motivated to play in the national spotlight, the decision came as a blow.
“I was opposed to it [and] it was a big deal,” says Benjamin B. Baker ’62, a team manager.
“They were tough teams to beat, but why should we shy away from teams that are hard to beat?” Baker adds, citing several instances where Harvard had defeated teams in the Western league.
This faculty’s decision, which Morse called “not very substantiated,” set off a long period of negotiation between the hockey team and administration.
“NCAA was being too judgmental [on the University of Denver],” Morse says, but “our complaints were more towards the University instead of NCAA. Our battle began with Harvard before anyone else.”
It was not until 1962, the third year of the prohibition, that the faculty confirmed the team’s suspicion and cited the “nature of the post-season event” as well as “the length of the season” as the major reasons for its actions. But Morse said the second explanation was weak.
The prohibition itself lasted much beyond the 1961 season. Even the underclassmen on the 1961 squad did not see the ban lifted during their playing careers.
MAKE A CASE
For the hockey team, the unfair recruiting standards at colleges in the WCHA did not constitute a serious problem. Rather, it was Harvard’s stubborn stance to forbid the team from playing at a national level that presented frustrations.
Adding to the annoyance was the reticence from the Faculty Committee, which had allowed all other varsity teams to participate in NCAA tournaments.
It was this lack of information that led team members to found the fact-finding committee.
With the help of some Crimson alumni at the University of Denver, the students tried to collect information on what had really happened there and met at least once a week.
During the hockey team’s campaign, the students found themselves not only dealing with the Faculty Committee, but also with school officials such as their advisors and athletic directors.
“We saw them as stodgy grandfathers,” Morse says.
In Jan. 1962, the hockey team presented its research result—a 29-page request to lift the ban—to the Faculty Committee. But Harvard refused to back down.
When it met the hockey team members for their request, the committee seemed to think of themselves as “very important people,” “looked down” at the team, and said “alright, make a case,” according to Baker.
FINAL RESULTS
By 1963, the fourth year of the ban, hockey players had stopped objecting to the decision and accepted it as a fact of life.
“They made the decision and we accepted. No one wrote letters. No one demonstrated,” says Ryland, who calls the faculty’s decision “disappointing.”
And half a century after the ban, even those who had protested the decision accept it.
“After all these years, it wasn’t the end of the world that we didn’t go,” Morse says.
“But it would have been nice if we went,” he immediately adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading to work on April 9, 1969, Archie C. Epps III and his colleagues anticipated the impending student takeover of University Hall. The raid, which garnered national attention, would be recorded in Harvard history as the symbolic zenith of Harvard student resistance during the late ’60s and early ’70s, a time fraught with undergraduate protest of the Vietnam War and Harvard’s administration more generally.
Yet while most administrators were quick to leave the building as students flooded in, Epps, an associate dean at the time, fortified himself in his office and departed only when the protestors carried him out.
Epps’ commitment to standing his ground solidified his position as a voice of authority within the administration while highlighting the complexity of his character.
A young African American from Louisiana who brought Malcolm X to speak at Harvard but also helped organize the March on Washington, Epps was not the typical voice of authority at a university that was still largely a bastion of white New Englanders.
In his 28 years as the College’s dean of students, Epps—a 1961 graduate of Harvard Divinity School—broke down barriers and sought to unite a College that was rapidly diversifying.
UNITING A COLLEGE
Matriculating at the Divinity School in the late 1950s, Epps realized that his new home would be drastically different from the place of his southern upbringing.
When he arrived in Cambridge, he and a few friends did a rough survey of Harvard’s graduate schools and found fewer than a dozen African Americans, according to Valerie Epps, who was married to Epps from 1969 until his death in 2003.
She said that despite being part of a small minority, Epps’ friendly personality allowed him to get along with nearly everyone. It was this affability that led Dean of the College John U. Monro ’35 to appoint Epps as a “baby dean,” one of Harvard’s associate deans, after his graduation from the Divinity School.
According to Epps’ son Josiah Epps, some questioned the appointment, believing that his father was hired solely because of his minority status. But over the course of his career, Epps would prove his ability not just as an administrator but as someone capable of uniting different factions throughout the College.
“In the era of black power, there was a tremendous push for separation by the blacks,” says Valerie Epps. “They wanted their own dorms, they wanted their own table in the dining hall. Archie fought against that.”
Because he did not always support the demands of Harvard’s African-American community, he was not necessarily popular with African-American students.
“When we got more minority students, that created some challenges for Archie,” says former University President Derek C. Bok. “I think that presented him with something of a challenge and I think he was viewed with some suspicion by minority students for some time.”
But his philosophy remained steadfast, and in his capacity as the dean responsible for minority issues, Epps refused to support a cultural center solely for African-American students as other colleges had done, fearing it would isolate the community from the rest of the College.
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who served as dean of the College while Epps was dean of students, says that Epps’ approach to improving diversity focused on bringing communities together rather than isolating them.
“He was resolutely an old-fashioned integrationist,” Lewis says. “He was very proud of Harvard, very proud of his associations with Harvard. He wanted what Harvard had to offer to be open to people like him and others.”
Epps was also given the responsibility for dealing with student groups when Harvard and Radcliffe merged completely in 1977.
“He decided everything had to be open to everyone,” says Lewis, explaining that Epps decided that final clubs would no longer be a part of the University after refusing to accept women.
“He would sometimes take a long time to come down on something like that, but when he decided ... he was always clear and firm. He was a very principled person,” Lewis says.
FROM SOUTH TO NORTH
Epps was born in Lake Charles, La., where Jim Crow laws segregating whites and blacks were predominant. Despite the inherent disadvantages of being black in the Deep South, Epps’ family provided him with opportunities. His parents were local business owners and school teachers.
Still, Josiah Epps says that his father did not talk much about his early life.
“He was very happy with the life he made here and had very mixed feelings about growing up in Lake Charles, La., as a black man,” says Josiah Epps, noting that as a child his father’s home was near the beach, but racial segregation required the family to travel more than 300 miles to swim in the water.
After moving north, Epps was accepted into the Harvard community and became an icon, recognizable to people across Boston.
“The minute I meet anybody in the Boston area, they say, ‘Epps, are you related to Archie Epps?’” says Valerie Epps. “He just was like a semi-celebrity.”
Josiah Epps says that this celebrity status resonated with people of all kinds.
“I can talk to professors and deans who tell me how great he was and then talk to security guards and maintenance workers who have the same thing to say about him,” he says.
When the Harvard Foundation began its project to introduce diversity into Harvard’s collection of painted portraits, Epps was one of the first to be honored with a portrait that now hangs in University Hall.
“I’m extremely proud that it’s there and in that building. It’s really about the longevity of Harvard,” Josiah Epps says. “Harvard’s been around 400 years and in another 400 years that portrait will still be around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As R. Eden Martin remembers it, he and future Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 would spend evenings sparking a fire, drinking from a bottle of cheap scotch whiskey, and discussing life.
Martin and Souter—both Harvard Law School students and freshman proctors at the time—lived side-by-side in Straus Hall A and B entryways, respectively.
Despite Souter’s many prominent legal positions throughout his career, culminating in his appointment to the nation’s highest court, friends and colleagues say that Souter’s quiet intellect, warm demeanor, and tendency to keep his life private have remained consistent since his freshman year at Harvard—and even since his high school years in New Hampshire.
FROM WEARE TO WASHINGTON
As a student at Concord High School, Souter had a reputation for reading every book in the public library. Every day after school, the young Souter spent hours at the library while waiting for his father—who worked at a bank in Concord—before they both made the commute back to their home in Weare, N.H.
“He was clearly the smartest kid that had passed through the high school in a long time,” says Harris A. Berman ’60, a fellow Concord High and Harvard graduate. During college, Berman often gave Souter rides back to Concord.
Berman took an English class with Souter at Concord High and said Souter enjoyed finding the fine points in each lesson and partaking in class debates.
“He spiced up the class just because he was so smart,” Berman says.
Jonathan Lurie ’61, now a professor of history at Rutgers, lived two floors up from Souter in Straus B entryway, the entryway for which Souter would act as proctor during his time at the Law School.
Lurie remembers Souter as being a very quiet yet spiritual student, and often walked through Harvard Yard with Souter to the seminary.
“Neither as a judge, nor as a person, nor as a student, he never wore his distinction on his sleeve.” Lurie says. “That’s what I like most about him.”
As an undergraduate, Souter worked for the Phillips Brooks House Association, was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, and was named to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.
Souter wrote his senior thesis on the judicial philosophy of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., class of 1861—his predecessor on the court and fellow member of the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa society. After graduating, Souter then studied at Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship before returning to Harvard to attend the Law School and serve as a proctor.
Souter was the type of proctor “that [freshmen] could come visit with and have a beer with,” according to Martin.
Martin adds that Souter often socialized with himself and other proctors, and that he didn’t partake in the competitive culture of the Law School.
“He was a brilliant student, but he didn’t have to study very hard because he didn’t have to,” Martin says, adding that Souter’s effortless mastering of legal concepts was sometimes frustrating. “He was detached from the law school rat race to a certain degree because he never intended to go practice in New York.”
Martin adds that Souter always intended to return to New Hampshire, an ambition Souter indeed realized. After moving back to Concord, he worked as the state’s Assistant Attorney General and then as the Deputy Attorney General.
Souter was appointed to the bench for the first time in 1978, on the Superior Court of New Hampshire. In 1983, he was appointed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, and in 1990, Bush appointed Souter to sit on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Souter was nominated to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 and was confirmed by a Senate vote of 90-9.
Though many assumed Souter would vie for traditional conservative values as a justice, Souter reaffirmed Roe v. Wade and voted against school prayer. At the time of his retirement in 2009, Souter was considered one of the more liberal justices on the court.
THE SAME SOUTER
Despite his appointment to ever-higher positions on the judicial bench, Souter remained a modest and friendly neighbor.
Philip R. Boulter attended Concord High a year below Souter, and maintained a professional relationship with Souter when the two lived in the Concord area. He said that, despite Souter’s status, the judge remained friendly when the two ran into one another while grocery shopping. Boulter added that Souter loved to hike, often in the White Mountains in New Hampshire.
“David is very quiet [and] incredibly bright,” Boulter says. “He’s a personal person who was warm and friendly towards everybody.”
Lurie reconnected with Souter when Souter was on the Supreme Court, sometimes bringing his students to Washington, D.C. where Souter would introduce them to the Court.
After ascending from Straus A-11 to the nation’s highest court, Souter—who Lurie remembered as friendly, private, and smart as a whip—is the same man.
“The one thing I remember about him is that he never changed,” Lurie says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a young second lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, Paul C. Morgan ’61 remembers being woken up late one night by a senior officer while aboard the USS Saufley. Because of the danger of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the destroyer had to prepare to set sail immediately.
Only one year after Morgan’s graduation from Harvard as a member of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, he was charged with waking up others onboard and getting the ship ready to sail, without disclosing the reason.
“It was just like a movie,” he says.
At a time when service in the military was an expectation for a majority of young men, Morgan joined a number of his classmates in participating in ROTC—which remained a normal part of University life through the escalation of the Vietnam War.
DOING THEIR DUTY
As the Class of 1961 graduated from Harvard, the U.S. military was rapidly increasing its presence in southeast Asia, with troop numbers tripling from their levels earlier that year. The Korean War had ended less than a decade before, and conflict was on students’ minds—but it was not until later that anti-war fervor would sweep through Harvard’s campus.
A fear of being drafted led many of the cadets to join ROTC—in many cases, those who volunteered for service were able to avoid combat zones. But a number of students say they had other reasons as well.
Experiences in the military, for one, were more familiar than they are to today’s average Harvard student. Samuel H. Young ’61 signed up for Army ROTC because of the importance that his family placed on military service.
“It was my father’s duty to be in World War II,” he says, “And it was my duty to do officer training.”
PART OF THE SCENERY
On June 14, 1961—the day before their graduation from Harvard College—62 ROTC students received their commissions as officers in a ceremony where former Defense Secretary Neil H. McElroy ’25 spoke. There were 39 Naval midshipmen, 18 Army cadets, and five Air Force cadets.
Receiving a commission meant that each of the 62 students had completed the classes required for a Harvard degree as well as the military science courses and physical training that differentiated them from their peers.
Most ROTC graduates from the Class of 1961 say that ROTC was not seen as unusual.
“It was a pretty accepted part of the scenery,” Col. Arthur L. Boright ’61 says.
And being in ROTC did not necessarily make the students stand out individually.
William R. Cronin ’61 says that ROTC was well known to some, but as ROTC classes were held near the old Scientific Labs past Memorial Hall, cadets and midshipmen only encountered a certain segment of the Harvard population. And the students in ROTC only wore their uniforms on occasion, for training and classes.
But there remained some tensions with the broader College community—although the former cadets say they were based on frivolous humor rather than anti-military sentiment. Morgan remembers non-ROTC students “having fun at our expense” and teasing the ROTC students with jokes about military careers.
But despite the teasing, Morgan says, “We weren’t castigated at all. It was sort of a fun difference.”
A FREE EDUCATION
However, there remained key differences in the experiences of ROTC students and others at Harvard in 1961.
At a time when financial aid was not prevalent, a number of participants in ROTC received scholarships from the military.
Some, like John R. Verani ’61, received money that covered their entire tuition, plus room and board. He says that when he agreed to serve four years in the Navy, the financial aid he received allowed him to go to Harvard, as his parents could not have afforded the tuition.
“It was an opportunity for me to have a Harvard education in exchange for the commitment,” he says.
Other students received funding only to pay for the extra ROTC courses they took.
In addition, all ROTC students participated in mandatory summer training.
Naval ROTC students were required to go on at least one summer cruise while at Harvard, while cadets of the other services fulfilled other missions. Verani’s cruises as a midshipman took him to the Netherlands, the Mediterranean Sea, Florida, and Texas in different summers.
“The summer cruises were for me a life -changing experience,” Verani says, adding that he had not traveled much before arriving at Harvard.
CHANGE ON THE HORIZON
The size of Harvard’s ROTC contingent fluctuated widely throughout the early 1960s. From a high of 138 graduates in 1958, it dropped in 1961, and then rose again to 100 in 1962—only to drop off sharply with the 1964 election of Lyndon B. Johnson, who had made campaign promises not to send troops to Vietnam. The next spring, Johnson went back on those promises and began a troop build-up in Asia.
Growing anger over the war soon swept through Harvard and the country, culminating with ROTC’s 1969 departure from campus and a subsequent ban on University support for the program.
The University only officially recognized the military’s presence on campus again in spring of this year.
But for many members of the Class of 1961 who served in the military, the experience made them more appreciative of civilian life.
Charles B. Condon ’61, who entered Harvard as an army veteran, says serving in the military made him take work more seriously.
“It was tantamount to a separate educational experience,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the five years since the retirement of Sandra Day O’Connor from the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy—a 1961 graduate of Harvard Law School—has wielded what many consider the most important vote on the Court.
Kennedy’s ballot has often been the least predictable, often deciding whether the Court will decide conservatively or liberally.
“He is the critical swing vote on many constitutional matters,” said David W. Adamany ’58, a law professor and former president of Temple University who was also a Law School classmate of Kennedy’s.
But in his time at Harvard, there were few hints that Kennedy would one day be the critical vote on the highest court in the nation. Despite graduating cum laude from the Law School, classmates describe Kennedy during that time as a friendly, regular student.
FRIEND TO MANY
In law school, friends could always spot Kennedy in a crowd by looking for his most distinctive feature: a green sweater, which he reportedly wore every day.
“Whether the green sweater ever got sent to the cleaners, I’ll never know,” says University of Virginia Professor Robert M. O’Neil ’56, recalling the look of Kennedy, whom he sat next to in constitutional law class at the Law School.
Friends said the thoughtfulness and humility that characterized Kennedy as a student have continued throughout his career on the bench.
“He was a very conscientious student,” O’Neil says. “He was easy to like and always was around friends.”
“Even in his exalted status, Kennedy has always been modest and straightforward,” he adds.
From his early years, law school seemed like an inevitability for Kennedy, whose father was an influential lawyer in Sacramento.
“There was really, really no choice. My dad was an attorney.” Kennedy said in a 2005 interview with the Academy of Achievement. “I’d say, ‘Oh, I have a geometry test.’ He said, ‘I’ll teach you whatever you need to know.’ So, I probably saw 10 trials before I was out of high school.”
Although Kennedy did not like school when he was younger, he grew to like it, earning admission into Stanford University and spending his final year of his undergraduate education at the London School of Economics before attending Harvard.
Those who know Kennedy stressed that today he defies the stereotype of a stuffy old judge.
“He’s by no means a dull or severe personality—very lively personality with a great sense of humor,” Adamany says. He notes that Kennedy hosted an event at the Law School’s 50th reunion for the Class of 1961 this past April, appearing alongside fellow Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, who graduated from the Law School in 1986.
THE SWING VOTE
After serving as a professor at McGeorge School of Law of the University of the Pacific, Kennedy was appointed to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1975. In 1988, Ronald Reagan nominated Kennedy for the Supreme Court, after his first two nominees failed to gain Senate approval.
In recent years, Kennedy has become the court’s swing vote, and determining the outcome in crucial 5-4 decisions has made him both an hero to some causes and a lightning rod for criticism.
Adamany cites two important cases in which Kennedy has served as the deciding vote on the Supreme Court decision.
In Lawrence v. Texas, Kennedy sided with the court’s liberals in striking down sodomy laws that particularly targeted homosexuals.
“He affirmed for the first time that gays and lesbians are part of the American community and should be treated with dignity,” Adamany says of the decision. “As he read the opinion there were muffled sounds in the courtroom—it was of gay and lesbian lawyers who had come to hear the decision, weeping.”
More often than not, however, Kennedy has sided with the more conservative side of the Court, as exhibited in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Elections Committee. The decision in that case struck down laws preventing corporations from spending corporate money on political campaigns.
Kennedy has accumulated criticisms for his decisions, notably from Jeffrey Rosen in The New Republic, who claims that Kennedy uses instinct in place of rigorous analysis.
But Jan C. Greenburg, author of a bestselling book on the Supreme Court, said that critiques of Kennedy are most often based off of his refusal to adhere strictly to conservative values and not a thorough legal analysis of his decisions.
Regardless of the varying evaluations of Kennedy’s legal career, O’Neil called him an “unsung hero,” emphasizing that he treasures his Harvard Law School connection. And for Kennedy, after all these years of being involved in the law, he still has a passion for it.
“I have great admiration for the system,” Kennedy said in a 2009 interview with C-SPAN. “The system works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With nearly a half-century of experience in foreign relations and diplomacy, W. Anthony K. Lake ’61 has visited nearly every nation in the world. Now the executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Lake has had a variety of diplomatic roles throughout his career, from serving in President Nixon’s White House to serving as National Security Advisor under President Clinton from 1993 to 1997.
Arriving on Harvard’s campus in the fall of 1957, Lake was not set on a career in diplomacy.
“I wasn’t sure, because I developed a real love in my sophomore, junior, senior year for American colonial history,” Lake recalls. “But [I] also took the foreign service exam because I was interested in American foreign policy and international relations.”
In fact, Lake’s political involvement at Harvard was fairly limited.
“I was less interested in being involved in politics on campus than in studies and sports,” Lake says.
Lake jokes that he spent much of his college career “playing a lot of sports very badly.”
In particular, Lake still vividly recalls his senior season, in which he singlehandedly cost the squash team their undefeated record, with the added humiliation of losing to Yale.
“I got [squash coach Jack Barnaby] to admit that I was the worst squash player in his time at Harvard,” Lake remembers.
“He was a very quiet contemplative sort of fellow,” says Dan L. Goldwasser ’61, who lived across the hall from Lake his freshman year. “When I saw him on television [during Lake’s years serving under Clinton], he didn’t look much different than he had when he was in college ... He was a very warm, quiet fellow.”
That characterization remains true today, his colleagues say.
“I would describe Tony as very cerebral,” says Chester A. Crocker, a colleague of Lake’s at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. “He’s not a table-pounding individual. He’s very deliberate in the way he speaks and careful in the way he thinks.”
As an American history concentrator, Lake fondly remembers crossing paths with at least one notable professor who he would later work with closely.
“There were a number of wonderful historians,” Lake notes. “I also took a course from Henry Kissinger, and ironically later ended up as his special assistant in the White House.” In particular, Lake says he was motivated by John F. Kennedy’s call to public service.
Lake resigned from his position under Kissinger in 1970 shortly following the invasion of Cambodia. Noting that working in such a contentious environment could be very intense, Lake says, “Kissinger to his credit welcomed and encouraged those internal arguments.”
Lake returned to the White House during the Clinton administration to serve as National Security Advisor, playing a part in the resolution of violence in Bosnia.
“Life in every White House is intense and challenging and fascinating,” Lake says. “While working very hard as I did to bring about the cease fire in northern Ireland or the Dayton agreements in Bosnia, or various other issues, it was very intense.”
While working with UNICEF may differ from working in the White House, Lake says it is no less absorbing. He recently finished his first year as executive director and is expected to remain at that post for at least four more years.
“I’ve been blessed always with having jobs that I loved,” Lake says.
Despite his multiple influential positions, Lake’s colleagues say that one of Lake’s defining characteristics is his humility.
“I more or less run it,” Lake says of UNICEF, quickly adding, “although it runs itself, and I’m often running after it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In addition to his wide-ranging influence within the academic and policy spheres of economics, Harvard Economics Professor Martin S. Feldstein ’61 has perhaps had his greatest impact in the classroom.
While sitting in a meeting about Social Security reform in the West Wing of the White House in 1999, Harvard Kennedy School Professor Jeffrey B. Liebman—once a Ph.D. student of Feldstein’s—realized he shared something with the others at the meeting.
“[I noticed] that three of the four economists in the room—Larry Summers, Doug Elmendorf, and myself—had been Marty’s students,” he said. “The fourth economist had studied at MIT under someone who himself had been a student of Marty’s.”
Feldstein, a professor at Harvard since 1967, has taught every level of economics, from introductory to upper-level graduate courses—training some of the world’s foremost economists in the process and spurring the Wall Street Journal to term him perhaps the “most influential economist of his generation.”
But his influence reaches far beyond Harvard. Feldstein served as the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Ronald Reagan from 1982 to 1984 and led the National Bureau of Economic Research as its president from 1984 to 2008.
AN INSPIRING TEACHER
In his 21-year role as head of Harvard’s introductory economics course, Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” Feldstein introduced hundreds of students to the discipline each year, beginning each fall with the same sentiment: “This is a particularly good year to be studying economics.”
“I always enjoyed teaching Ec 10, thinking about how to explain key issues to students with little to no background in economics,” Feldstein says.
Every year since he stopped teaching Ec 10, Feldstein has returned to Sanders Theatre to give a guest lecture on Social Security.
According to Harvard Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who took over the course from Feldstein in 2005, Feldstein never took a sabbatical in the 21 years he taught Ec 10.
“He’s a very dedicated teacher,” Mankiw says, “More dedicated than anyone I know.”
Mankiw conducted his graduate work at MIT under a professor who was a former student of Feldstein’s.
Although Feldstein now devotes all of his time in Harvard classrooms to the study of economics, as an undergraduate, Feldstein’s courses were much more diverse.
In fact, Feldstein completed the required pre-medical coursework and was debating between pursuing economics and attending medical school.
In the end, he chose economics, and in his over 40 years as a professor at Harvard, has taught students including University Professor and former University President Lawrence H. Summers, current Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, Columbia Business School Dean R. Glenn Hubbard, and prominent economist and Columbia University Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs ’76.
James M. Poterba ’80, a professor at MIT and current NBER president, says his interest in academic economics was first sparked when he worked with Feldstein as a research assistant the summer after his sophomore year of college.
Liebman, for whom Feldstein served as dissertation advisor and who now co-teaches Economics 1420: “American Economic Policy” with Feldstein, says that Feldstein inspires his students to “get out into the real world and figure out what is really going on, rather than hiding behind models and regression results.”
When Liebman was struggling to understand seemingly inconsistent results about the Earned Income Tax Credit, “Marty said, ‘Jeff, you aren’t studying fish. You can go out and talk to people,’” Liebman says. Acting on Feldstein’s advice, Liebman conducted field research and ultimately solved the puzzle.
BEYOND THE CLASSROOM
Feldstein has also had an enormous impact on the academic field of economics.
“He’s really one of the great men of economic policy,” Mankiw says. “There’s no question in anyone’s mind that he’s one of the stars of economics.”
Feldstein’s research focuses on issues of macroeconomics in the public sector, especially taxation and social insurance.
Feldstein is famous for his analysis of social welfare systems, which won him the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal in 1977, an award that goes to an economist under 40 judged to have made significant contributions to the field.
Over his career, Feldstein has penned over 300 articles, making him one of the most prolific economists in the world.
And Feldstein is often listed among those likely to win the Nobel Prize in economics in a given year.
“From my perspective he’d be a very plausible choice,” Mankiw says.
Feldstein has also played a significant role in encouraging the research of other economists as former president of the NBER, a nonprofit economic think tank based in Cambridge that gathers researchers together and sponsors academic articles.
“Marty had a transformative effect on the NBER,” Poterba says. “Under Marty’s leadership, the NBER had an enormous influence in promoting the expansion of empirical economic research, and in encouraging economists to carry out research on topics that would provide valuable input for policymakers.”
Additionally, Feldstein has worked in the government helping to implement policy, most notably as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Reagan, but also as an adviser to nearly every president since.
In 2005, when President George W. Bush was choosing Alan Greenspan’s replacement as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Feldstein was considered one of the two top contenders, ultimately losing out to current chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Convinced that “every young man in the world is fascinated with either sharks or dinosaurs,” as he said in an interview with National Geographic, Peter B. Benchley ’61 never shied away from the creatures that launched him to fame.
After the incredible success of his novel “Jaws” and the iconic Steven Spielberg-directed film co-written by Benchley, the novelist spent the rest of his life protecting sharks and promoting marine conservation.
Written in the back room of a New Jersey furnace company during the winters and in a small converted Connecticut turkey coop in the summers, the novel “Jaws”—about a great white shark “that wouldn’t go away”—inspired the 1975 film, one of the first summer blockbuster movies in Hollywood.
Benchley, who died in 2006, once said that all of his stories are “what if’s.”
“Jaws” was inspired by a story he read about a fisherman who had caught a 4,550-pound great white off of Long Island.
In a 1999 interview with Time, Benchley said he did not anticipate that “Jaws” would be a runaway success.
“No, I knew that ‘Jaws’ couldn’t possibly be successful,” Benchley said. “It was a first novel, and nobody reads first novels. It was a first novel about a fish, so who cares?”
Jaws stayed on the bestseller list for 44 weeks, selling over 20 million copies. Its film interpretation was the first movie to surpass $100 million in U.S. box office recipients.
Benchley’s interest in writing started when he was young. He freelanced starting at 16, and he continued writing through college as a stringer for The New York Herald Tribune. Later in life, he wrote speeches for President Lyndon B. Johnson.
Benchley was as indefatigable in his conservation campaigns as he was in his writing, striving to protect the animals his novel villianized.
Benchley has become a celebrity in the marine conservation world. In an email, Marie Levine, Founder and Executive Director of the Shark Research Institute, calls him “a great friend, a shark conservationist, and one of our patrons for many years.”
After Benchley’s death in 2006, she and the Institute honored him by inaugurating The Peter Benchley Shark Conservation Awards, which are given for outstanding contributions to shark conservation in science, advocacy, and media.
In an interview with The Paris Review, writer John McPhee remembers playing tennis with Benchley while both were living in Princeton, N.J.
“The thing I was so awed by and so admired about Peter was that he never stopped,” McPhee remembered. “Peter wrote and wrote and wrote ... The fact that he made all this money—life was about something else.”
Harvard was a place “pivotal for him,” Benchley’s brother Nathaniel wrote in an email to The Crimson. In college, Benchley concentrated in English, was a member of the Spee Club, and took a particularly formative course with visiting lecturer Lillian F. Hellman.
Following his graduation, Benchley traveled around the world with Charles D. Ravenel ’61, meeting people such as Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru whom he would later include in his book about his travels named “Time and a Ticket.”
Nathaniel Benchley says that his brother’s success was made more meaningful by his approach to life.
“Peter always understood that fame is a matter of luck and timing, as well as talent,” Nathaniel writes. “In person, Peter was even funnier and looser and more thoughtful than the characters he wrote about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a college student with a passion for Japan, John D. “Jay” Rockefeller IV ’58-’61 postponed his studies at Harvard for three years to study and do service there.
This first experience with hands-on volunteer work would cause Rockefeller to continue pursuing service opportunities, from the State Department to the Peace Corps. His passion for service would shape his career by leading him to the mining town of Emmons, W.Va., as a member of the Volunteers in Service to America program.
“Because of my time in Emmons, I found my cause in wanting to help West Virginians,” Rockefeller says.
Rockefeller, who has now served as a U.S. Senator from West Virginia for 26 years, has spent the rest of his career serving in a variety of political roles in the state.
LOOKING TO JAPAN
Even before enrolling at Harvard, Rockefeller had already developed an interest in Japan, possibly sparked by family trips taken during his childhood years, speculates Rockefeller’s roommate Pierre N. Leval ’59.
On campus, Rockefeller pursued this interest by concentrating in both Far Eastern Languages and History, but Leval says Rockefeller was more passionate about helping Japan outside the setting of academia.
“During his sophomore and junior year, he was not terribly interested in what was going on in his classes,” says Leval, who now serves as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Instead, Rockefeller “was interested in actively helping in Japan.”
In the late ’50s and early ’60s, Japan was still recovering from World War II and was very reliant on the international community in its efforts to reestablish itself.
“At the time, there were almost no American civilians in Japan,” Rockefeller says. “I decided to go take an intensive Japanese language course ... and travel across the country.”
For three years, Rockefeller postponed his studies at Harvard to assist in Japan. Rockefeller says the experience provided him with “a wonderful perspective that few Americans were able to get at the time, and it only furthered my interest in East Asian Studies.”
THE WORLD OF POLITICS
But beyond his interest in Japan, his time at Harvard also impacted Rockefeller’s political views, shaping the student who “didn’t really care about politics” into a future U.S. Senator.
Rockefeller entered college a Republican, largely due to his family’s political views, Rockefeller says. But that would soon change.
“I became a big fan of President Kennedy, and when he ran against Nixon, it solidified my support and my place as a Democrat,” says Rockefeller, who is now the only elected Democrat in the traditionally Republican Rockefeller dynasty.
But even with this increased interest in politics, Rockefeller says that while in college, he did not consider it likely that he would one day go on to run for office.
“After graduating, I was still trying to find my path and itching for a cause that I felt passionate about,” Rockefeller says. He worked in the State Department and then moved to the Philippines, where he volunteered for the Peace Corps.
But having spent years overseas, Rockefeller decided to return to the U.S. and learn more about his own country by working for the program that brought him to West Virginia.
Ezra F. Vogel—a Harvard social sciences professor emeritus—encountered Rockefeller in 1994 while they were both in Washington, D.C. Vogel then served as the National Intelligence Officer for East Asia at the National Intelligence Council.
“We’ve tried many times to get him to come back to Harvard,” Vogel says, “but he always felt that his mission was to work for the citizens of West Virginia.”
In 1966, Rockefeller was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates. Ten years later he was elected governor of West Virginia, and after two terms in that post he was elected to the U.S. Senate, an office he has held since.
“That cause has never wavered,” Rockefeller says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The brisk Boston wind swept over the dark brown hair of Timothy E. Wirth ’61 as he watched a young Massachusetts native who would become the next president.
While the election of 1960 was one of Wirth’s most memorable moments during his time at Harvard College, more inspiring was the culture of public service President John F. Kennedy ’40 cultivated during Wirth’s college years.
“This was a generation of ‘ask not what your country  can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,’” Wirth says.
Those words influenced Wirth well beyond his college years. Currently the president of the United Nations Foundation and a former U.S. Senator, the alert and energetic Wirth has created a life-long career based on serving others.
A GREENER FUTURE
As a Senator from Colorado for 17 years, Wirth found his passion in environmental issues. His support was influential in the passage of 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act that first outlined the structure of cap-and-trade for carbon emissions, as well as other significant environmental protection legislation—adding one million acres to the national wilderness preservation system.
Stirring much controversy in political circles, Wirth decided not to run for re-election in 1994, hoping to devote more energy to public service and environmental causes.
Wirth continues his work on the environment, hoping to create a greener world for his grandchildren, according to Richard S. Parnell, Chief Operating Officer of the U.N. Foundation. After working with billionaire entrepreneur Ted Turner—who donated millions to the U.N. to begin a philanthropic arm—Wirth became the president of the U.N. Foundation at its inception, focusing its work on humanitarian and climate change efforts.
“BABY DEAN”
Before beginning his career of politics and philanthropy, Wirth was “Baby Dean” of Harvard, a position for young graduates who would do administrative work in the Freshman Dean’s Office and University Hall.
“He handles pressure well,” says Fred L. Glimp ’50, Dean of Admissions during Wirth’s time in the administration. “He’s a positive ... young man and really an outstanding person.”
Wirth’s wife, Wren W. Wirth, says she believes her husband’s involvement with institutional issues early on set the trajectory for the rest of his career, from working as a White House Fellow under President Lyndon B. Johnson to serving in the U.S. Department of State as the first Undersecretary for Global Affairs under President Bill Clinton.
“The wonderful thing about his career path as it developed was the progression from local issues, to national issues, to international issues,” Wren Wirth says.
Wren Wirth adds that she was drawn to the energy that always emanated from her husband—a quality that she believes has made him successful in professional life.
“He has a great sense of irony and a great sense of [the] ridiculous,” she says.
His colleagues agree, adding that his visionary leadership and ability to think outside the box create a fruitful environment in the U.N. Foundation.
“Tim has a ‘happy dance.’ He’ll come in and he’ll sort of dance in your doorway and say, ‘we’re going to vaccinate another hundred children today,’” says Parnell.
“Tim is a dynamic leader—my favorite thing about Tim is that he challenges us and gives us the tools that he needs. He’s not at all a micro-manager or dictatorial manger,” he adds.
SETTLING DOWN
Wirth says spearheading the U.N. Foundation has “proved to be a very satisfying experience.”
According to Parnell, those who work around him feel a bond with Wirth because of the work he does.
“He’s absolutely beloved by his staff, and that’s rare,” says Parnell. “We have 200 people in this organization and he makes a point to know something about every person.”
Having accomplished so much and still working into his 70’s, Wirth has no plans to retire, according to his wife. She says he will continue to carry on the tasks of the U.N. Foundation, strengthening and expanding the organization.
“He’s the type of person that would have 50 new projects and be busier than he was before,” she says, only half jokingly.

A handful of Harvard Graduate School of Education students stood quietly on the porch steps to Longfellow Hall on Thursday at about 8 a.m., holding freshly printed white and yellow signs that said “Tenure Mark Warren” and raising them silently as cars passed down Appian Way.
The students’ protest was a continuation of their efforts to convince the Ed School administration to approve the tenure of Ed School professor Mark R. Warren, who specializes in community organizing and school reform.
According to the protestors—who consisted of masters and doctoral students—a few students at a time will be sitting in the hallway of Longfellow in front of the door to Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney’s office every day until Commencement.
The rotating group of protestors will be drawn from roughly 90 students on a mailing list created in response to Warren’s April 12 tenure denial.
In mid-April, 60 students gathered outside of a faculty meeting to protest the decision regarding Warren.
“What he does ... is absolutely important to the work of education,” said Houman D. Harouni, a student at the protest on Thursday. “It’s the kind of work that’s definitely missing from Harvard.”
“People are very unhappy at the direction this school is going in,” said Ayana Kee, an Ed School student at the sit-in on Thursday. “We will wait as long as it takes for [the dean] to do the right thing.”
Michael G. Rodman, Ed School director of communications, said that prior to the start of the sit-ins on Thursday, McCartney had reached out to the group of protestors and offered to meet with them in a small face-to-face setting to discuss their views. The protestors have not responded to the invitation.

When Tiffany L. Smalley ’11 receives her diploma at the Commencement ceremony on May 26, she will become the first Wampanoag Indian to graduate from Harvard College since 1665.
During her four years at Harvard, Smalley, a government concentrator with a secondary in ethnic studies, was active in raising awareness of the Native American culture on campus.
She served as co-director of a project that built a wetu—a traditional Wampanoag home—in Harvard Yard. The wetu was constructed near the site of Harvard’s Indian College, which was founded in 1655 to fulfill a statement in Harvard’s Charter of 1650 that called for “the education of the English & Indian Youth of this Country in knowledge and godliness.” The Indian College offered the same classes as the College, but did not charge its students for tuition or housing.
The last Wampanoag Indian to graduate from Harvard was Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, who graduated from the Harvard Indian College in 1665.
Smalley, however, will not be the only Wampanoag Indian to receive a diploma at this year’s Commencement exercises.
Joel Iacoomes, a member of the Wampanoag tribe who died in a shipwreck just before his graduation from the Indian College in 1665, will be honored with a special posthumous degree.
“With the presentation of this degree, we also recognize some of the commitments that were fundamental to the founding of Harvard: a commitment to a diversity of students, a commitment to the communities in which the College was founded, and a commitment to the power of education to transform lives,” Harvard President Drew G. Faust said in an article in the Harvard Gazette.
The incoming freshman class at Harvard is reported to be 1.6 percent Native American.

Drinking coffee—whether it is regular or decaffeinated—can lower the risk of prostate cancer among men, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
In a new study published on May 17, men who regularly drank six or more cups of coffee daily were nearly 20 percent less likely to develop any form of prostate cancer than those who had none. Furthermore, coffee drinkers had a 60 percent lower risk of lethal prostate cancer—the most severe form of the disease, which often spreads to the bones and results in death.
Researchers examined the coffee consumption of 47,911 men every four years from 1986 to 2008 as part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. While consuming six or more cups daily reduced the risk of lethal prostate cancer by 60 percent, even drinking one to three cups can lower the risk by 30 percent.
“But people should not change their coffee habits based on any one study,” said lead author Kathryn M. Wilson, a research fellow in epidemiology at the School of Public Health.
Prostate cancer, the most frequently diagnosed form of cancer, is the second leading cause of death among U.S. men, affecting one in six men during their lifetimes.
Wilson said there has been evidence that physical activity and abstinence from smoking can also help reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
Coffee has different biological effects on insulin, antioxidant, and sex hormone levels that are helpful in determining men’s risk of prostate cancer, Wilson said.
“Coffee is so commonly consumed and it is of interest because of its large intake in our population,” Wilson said.
Prior studies have shown that coffee is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, gallstone disease, and liver cancer.
The study, “Coffee Consumption and Prostate Cancer Risk and Progression in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study,” was published in an online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

The much anticipated mid-2011 recommendations outlining the future of Harvard’s development in Allston will be released this June, according to Bill Purcell, co-chair of the Harvard Allston Work Team—which is writing the recommendations.
“I think it’s about time because they have had time to get their ideas together, stabilize their budget, and figure out what their priorities are,” said Harvard Allston Task Force Member Ray Mellone.
The Work Team—a 14-person group of deans, alumni, and faculty members—was commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust in December 2009 to develop proposals for Harvard’s developments in the neighborhood. Faust charged the work team, also chaired by Harvard Business School Professor Peter Tufano ’79 and Graduate School of Design Professor Alex Krieger, to collect input from Allston residents.
But residents say they feel the group has not communicated enough with them, and many were unaware that recommendations would be released next month.
“The work team, as far as I know, has been completely closed to any participation,” said Task Force member Brent Whelan ’73.
The Task Force is composed of a group of Allston residents, which provide Harvard with feedback on its work in Allston.
“As a member of the Task Force, I had to ask for some formal participation ever since the team was appointed,” Whelan said.
Whelan recalled that two years ago, he and other community members partnered with a retired architect and urban planner to develop a viable way for moving the Charlesview Apartments—a cluster of low-income housing units located near the Business School.
While city leaders supported the plan, Harvard rejected it, he said.
Whelan noted that monthly coffee hours hosted by Purcell in the Ed Portal have allowed for community input. But both he and Task Force member Ray Mellone say they feel those hours were not sufficient.
“I’m not sure how far those ideas have penetrated [the Work Team’s] thinking,” Mellone said.
University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who oversees the Work Team, said the group’s recommendations will be shared with the community and other stakeholders.
Neither Purcell nor Lapp would comment on the shape the recommendations will take or the nature of their content, because members had not yet finalized plans in their last meeting, Purcell said.
“My sense is that they will be tangible ideas, specific ideas,” Lapp said.
Allston community members say they are anxious to see a formal presentation and hope the University prioritizes Allston development.
“[We] want to make sure we’re not left out of the equation for the development they want to do in the future,” Mellone said. “We’ve been sitting in suspense for a year and a half.”
Residents say they have faith in Allston’s success and are open and willing to working in collaboration with Harvard.
“We believe in a strong community, not a devastated one,” Whelan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new Starbucks Coffee shop opened in the center of Harvard Square on Friday morning with a small ceremony, in which General Manager C. Shane Sykes cut a green ribbon separating a small crowd of eager customers from the double doors to the two-story cafe.
The quiet kickoff, which was attended by Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson, was in contrast to the bustle and loud hum of chatter that would soon fill the polished interior of the new store.
The second floor, which has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mass. Ave, offers a variety of seating options for both social and studying needs, and also sports a modest stage for hosting live bands.
“Our mission is that the entertainment will support the coffee vibe,” Sykes told The Crimson in an interview prior to the store’s opening.
On Sunday afternoon, John W. Guenther, a calculus teacher at Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall School in Waltham, sat at a center table on the second floor, grading a stack of papers. He said that he is a loyal customer to the Starbucks in Davis Square, but will definitely be back to the new Harvard Square location.
Guenther said that, compared to other stores in Harvard Square, this new Starbucks is an “improvement.”
Across from Guenther, Phil W. Hyde, a graduate and former employee of the Harvard Kennedy School, said that he thinks this new Starbucks will cut into the business of the Starbucks in the Garage—his preferred Starbucks location.
He said he hopes that, as a result, the Garage Starbucks will be less crowded when he next returns.
Still, Hyde said he admits that the new Starbucks is a good space for tourists and young people.
“It’s like the cafe at Lamont,” Hyde said—a social space for students who are studying, who stay for long hours to get work done.
“I love the vibe—the warm colors,” said Catherine C. Doherty ’12, who frequents Starbucks about four times a week. “The lighting is great from the window.”
Tim M. Hanchin, a graduate from the Harvard Divinity School, said that he is a loyal Starbucks customer who usually studies in the Garage location.
“I think it’s brilliant,” he said of the new store.
“I would call it earthy-intellectual,” he added, noting that the contrast of the store’s interior aesthetic juxtaposed with the urban setting of the T stop outside.
The new Starbucks is open until 1 a.m. every day.
