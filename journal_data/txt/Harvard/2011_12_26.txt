At first, the Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation at Massachusetts General Hospital feels more like a theater lobby than a medical office. A panoramic window overlooking Boston graces the foyer, autographed photos of celebrity patients punctuate the pristine hallway, and a palpable serenity permeates the atmosphere. Then Dr. Steven M. Zeitels appears, walking briskly down the hall followed by a physician's assistant and a visiting fellow—and suddenly the whole place comes alive.
Zeitels is the center's director and the Eugene B. Casey Professor of Laryngeal Surgery at Harvard Medical School. Since the center's inception over ten years ago, Zeitels has used laser microsurgery to repair the vocal abilities of over a thousand patients with laryngeal tumors. In November, Dr. Zeitels operated on the Grammy Award-winning singer, Adele, who was suffering from recurrent bleeding of a benign polyp.
"They are very giving and willing to help," he said of his celebrity patients. "They understand that it is their leadership that a lot of individuals will follow, and when they give attention to something, it helps society." Julie Andrews, also a patient of Zeitels, serves as the Honorary Chairwoman for the Institute of Laryngology and Voice Restoration, a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 to promote education and research in laryngeal rehabilitation.
Zeitels is not just a celebrity voice doctor, however. A framed "thank you" note from a little girl named Jennifer hangs in his office, serving as a reminder of Zeitels's wide patient base, which varies in age and socioeconomic status. "I'm a cancer surgeon, that's my fellowship," Zeitels said. "When the outside world sees this thing related to singers, they think you're a voice surgeon. We just brought the rigors of surgical management to singers."
Although Zeitels has spent most of his career in Boston and Cambridge, he is originally from New Rochelle, N.Y. During his childhood, he spent many hours doing leatherwork, a hobby to which he credits his surgical skills. "The hand-eye technique and creativity came from the leatherwork. When I was in medical school I would watch the operations, and would be able to immediately participate."
Zeitels is an innovator in his field. He has designed more than 20 new laryngeal and pharyngeal procedures, and holds three laryngoscope patents. When he is not practicing medicine, Zeitels is busy working on his two latest projects. The first is a collaborative effort that involves reconstructing voice boxes with cadaver aorta; the second is the development of a biomaterial that he and his colleagues hope to apply to injured vocal cords—having a pliable enough material at this stage could make hoarseness disappear. "Once we get the materials soft enough, we are likely to create super-singers," Zeitels said.
Zeitels has received more than 50 awards and honored lectureships over the course of his career, but he believes that his success has been greatly dependant on his collaborations. "You need other people to stimulate you. You need to be around other thoughtful people" Zeitels said. "It's hard to innovate in surgery and medicine in a bubble."

After its 63-51 victory over Florida Atlantic on Thursday, the Harvard men’s basketball team has regained its spot in the AP rankings and moved up in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll. In both, the Crimson achieved its top position in program history.
Harvard (10-1) now finds itself ranked No. 23 in the ESPN/USA Today poll after receiving 92 votes.  But that puts the team far behind No. 22 Pittsburgh, which received 159 votes after a Christmas Eve upset at the hands of Wagner dropped the Panthers nine spots.
Harvard improved on its ranking from last week, when its 53 votes garnered the Crimson the No. 25 spot.
Bumped out of the top 25 in the AP Poll after a loss to UConn in early December, Harvard regained its lost ground. The Crimson’s 121 points pushed the squad past No. 25 San Diego State, which earned 119 points, and into the No. 24 spot.
But similar to the ESPN/USA Today poll, Harvard finds itself far behind the next-ranked team, with No. 23 Virginia receiving 214 points.
The Crimson will have its hands full defending its best poll appearances yet. Harvard heads over to Chestnut Hill, Mass. to take on cross-town rival Boston College (5-7) on Thursday before hosting Saint Joseph’s (9-3) on New Year’s Eve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the eve of both Christmas and the start of the 2011-12 NBA season, Jeremy Lin ’10 received some coal from the Houston Rockets.
According to the Houston Chronicle, Lin was released on Saturday night to make room for big man and nine-year NBA veteran Samuel Dalembert. The team made the official announcement regarding Dalembert early this morning, just hours before flying to Orlando for its first regular-season game of the year.
The past three weeks have had many turns for Lin. On Dec. 9 the Golden State Warriors waived the Harvard alum following a rookie season in which he appeared in 29 games, averaging 2.6 points, 1.4 assists, and 1.2 rebounds, and 1.1 steals during his time on the court.
Only two days following his release from the Warriors, the Rockets claimed the second-year guard off of waivers. In his two pre-season games with Houston last week, Lin notched a total of six points, one rebound, and one assist in eight minutes of playing time.
The Rockets are set to make the official announcement of Lin’s release later today.
