After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though it led at halftime, the Harvard men’s basketball team could not hold on Friday night, falling to No. 3/2 Oklahoma (11-0) in the final game of the Diamond Head Classic by a score of 83-71.
Looking to spoil the Sooners’ undefeated season, the Crimson (5-7) pulled within five with under four minutes to play, but it was not enough to overcome a 27-4 Oklahoma run that spanned the end of the first half and the first five minutes of the second.
“We’ve got to figure out how we can play four minutes at a time,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We certainly weren’t able to do that here in this championship game here this afternoon.”
Amaker consistently emphasizes the first four minutes of every half to his team, but while the Crimson kept it close during the first four minutes of the first half, the Sooners scored the first 17 points of the second half, forcing Harvard to play catch-up for the rest of the game.
The run happened in the blink of an eye. After going to the locker room down 37-35, the Sooners came out firing in the second half. Just eight seconds into the second frame, senior forward Ryan Spangler knocked down an open three to put Oklahoma up by one. After freshman guard Corey Johnson missed a three, the Sooners got the ball back to Spangler for a second trey.
From there, Oklahoma set the pace of play. While the Crimson had slowed the speed of the game in the first half, the Sooners blew the game open in the second with a flurry of fast break points, culminating in eight straight Buddy Hield points to put the Sooners up, 52-35.
“It was a tough stretch for us right there coming out of halftime,” Amaker said. “We knew transition defense was going to be key, and boy they turned their defense up and really got after us. It was like a jailbreak to the other end of the floor.”
Harvard finally got on the board in the second frame on a dunk from senior forward Evan Cummins with 16:15 remaining in the half, but the damage had been done.
In the process of Oklahoma growing its lead to 15, Johnson also picked up his third and fourth fouls, sending him to the bench early. Without Johnson, who has made the second-most treys of any freshman nationwide, Amaker’s style of playing inside-out and stretching the floor was hindered.
Without Johnson to help spread the floor, junior forward Zena Edosomwan took control. Beginning with a jumper with 12:40 remaining that pushed the score to 62-44, Edosomwan sparked a 12-0 Crimson run that brought his side within single digits. The Los Angeles native had five of the team’s 12 points over the four-minute span.
“I don’t fear anyone—I want to play the game, and I think they should fear me,” Edosomwan said. “I was playing as aggressive as possible within the system and within the team and finding my spots.”
The run, however, was too little too late. A jumper by Edosomwan with 4:28 remaining cut Oklahoma’s lead to five, but that was as close as the Crimson would get. A three-point play by Hield five possessions later stretched the Oklahoma lead to eight and put the game out of reach.
Going into the game, the Crimson’s keys to success were limiting Hield and defending the three-point shot. In the first half, Harvard was largely successful. Senior Agunwa Okolie, the Crimson’s top defender, kept Hield to just 11 points in the opening frame and the Sooners shot just 27 percent from behind the arc. In the second half, however, Hield lit up Okolie and the rest of the Harvard defense for 23 points, finishing the night with a career-high 34. As a team, Oklahoma shot 46 percent from deep in the second frame, including five-of-five in the first five minutes out of the locker room.
During the first two games of the Diamond Head Classic, Okolie was successful in limiting the production of the opponent’s top offensive player—BYU’s Kyle Collinsworth and Auburn’s Kareem Canty. Hield was a different story, burning the Crimson from nearly every spot on the floor, posing a threat to pull up for a shot or drive to the rim on any play. To go along with his sharp shooting in traffic, Hield shot 9-of-10 from the charity stripe. Meanwhile, Hield's partner in the backcourt—junior Jordan Woodard—added 28 points of his own on 9-of-13 shooting.
It was Edosomwan who provided the offensive spark for Harvard. The junior had a career-high 25 points to go along with 16 rebounds in 34 minutes. Edosomwan had his way in the post on offense in the first half, with starting Oklahoma center Khadeem Lattin heading to the bench early with foul trouble.
In the second half, Edosomwan had to work more for his shots. With the Crimson shooting just over 28 percent from three in the second frame, more pressure was placed on Edosomwan, but he continued to perform, with 12 of his 25 points coming in the final 20 minutes.
With the loss, Harvard finishes the tournament 2-1 after victories over BYU and Auburn. The defeat was the Crimson’s first in a mid-season tournament during the Amaker-era, after Harvard won the Battle 4 Atlantis in 2011 and the Great Alaska Shootout in 2013.
“[We] knew we were better than our record, and we are continuing to show we are better than our record,” Edosomwan said. “As we get close to Ivy League play, we played two top-five teams in the country and played our hearts out, and I think we should have all the confidence in the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 20 minutes of action, the Harvard men’s basketball team (5-7) looked to be on its way to a Christmas Day upset, leading the undefeated No. 3/2 Oklahoma Sooners (11-0) by two at the break in the final of the Diamond Head Classic.
The second half was another story. It took Harvard 19 minutes to build a six-point lead, but Oklahoma just a minute and a half to erase it. The Sooners were even more opportunistic with the next two minutes, lengthening the lead to double digits. By the time Harvard coach Tommy Amaker took a timeout five minutes into the second stanza, the lead was 19.
Although the Crimson would later cut the lead to five, precocious Sooners forward Buddy Hield would not be denied. Hield, who set the tournament record with a combined 86 points across the three games, scored 10 straight Sooner points late in the second. His three-point play with two minutes to go pushed the Oklahoma lead to eight and prevented Harvard from getting within two possessions the rest of the way. The Crimson fell by a final score of 83-71.
“[We] had our opportunities to grind away at it a little bit more, but it wasn’t meant to be,” Amaker said. “They are very good.”
TAKING CHARGE
While Hield was the story for the Sooners, junior forward Zena Edosomwan stole the show on the Harvard side. Edosomwan had 25 points and 16 rebounds, the former statistic breaking a career high he had set just two games ago. The big man made 10 of his 20 field goal attempts and provided stout field goal defense for the Crimson, which held the Sooner front line to just 14 points.
“Zena was outstanding,” Amaker said. “We need some more help on the perimeter a little bit but he’s our guy on the interior and we played through him and you can see why.”
Edosomwan started the scoring for the Crimson, taking a feed from freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy for a rim-rattling dunk. The junior posted up repeatedly throughout the first half, attacking every big man in the Sooner rotation without fear. Oklahoma starting center Khadeem Lattin, who had set a career high with 17 points in the semifinals against Hawaii, played just 24 ineffective minutes through foul trouble. Backup Akolda Manyang had similar struggles containing Edosomwan, finishing with more fouls than points and rebounds combined.
Debuting the James Harden “let me eat” celebration for the first time this season, Edosomwan was an essential part of Harvard’s comeback. At one point, the junior had seven straight points as Harvard cut the lead to five late, including consecutive makes where he was fouled inside.
“I think a lot of guys have more confidence,” Edosomwan said. “I think you see our team coming together so hopefully you see us build on this and make strides.”
For the weekend, Edosomwan averaged 20.3 points and 13 rebounds, earning a spot on the All-Tournament team.
RAINING TRIPLES
Playing against the second-best three-point shooting team in the country, the Crimson looked the better marksmen during the opening stanza. Harvard had five of its nine triples in the opening period as freshman Corey Johnson and junior Corbin Miller continued their tournament-long assault from deep, combining for four.
However, both Johnson and Miller went cold in the second half—making just two of their nine attempts. While freshman Tommy McCarthy heated up, making three of the five treys he attempted, Harvard made just three of its first 10 shots from long distance as it tried to battle back.
The scene on the other side of the court could not have been more different. Although the Sooners and Crimson both finished the game 9-of-24 from behind the arc, the Sooners made six of their 13 second-half attempts, including their first five. The last one, a deep bomb from Hield with senior Agunwa Okolie in his face, pushed the lead to double digits with five minutes to go.
“They are explosive and I think they displayed that,” Amaker said.
