After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—What a game.
I’m going to be honest, this would be a much more angry post had it not been for the final half of the second period. With Harvard down by 10 at the break, I kept telling my friends and myself that our team could still make a comeback, that it wasn’t over. But once the half resumed and the Crimson made silly mistake after silly mistake, I thought, damn, what a poor showing. After a couple of years of strong performances in the NCAA tournament from the Ancient Eight, this was pretty disappointing. Then Laurent Rivard happened.
The Canadian had the hot hand in the second half to keep Harvard alive, finishing the game six of seven from beyond the arc. He made me believe that it was still possible to overcome what had once been an 18-point deficit. And the Crimson came quite close to accomplishing the feat—it was a two-possession game when destiny decided to make it impossible for Harvard to come out victorious.
Even though Vanderbilt played a good game and deserved to win, let me emphasize how terrible the officiating was. Charges were called when they weren’t charges; flagrant fouls were missed. The final two minutes were devastating to watch. The ref failed to call a blatant charge on Oliver McNally. On offense, McNally made a scrappy play to salvage the possession but the ref failed to realize that the Commodore was out of bounds when the senior threw the ball off his opponent’s body. This made it easy for Vanderbilt to do its part and close out the game. The final score did not reflect how close the game got, but hats off to the Commodores. They played a balanced game with fewer mistakes.
We put up a fight—one that almost gave me a heart attack and had my legs literally trembling—but I just wish that level of play and intensity had come sooner. This was most certainly a game we could have won with less silly turnovers and without the foul trouble. Harvard will also need to work on shooting the ball in the offseason. Watching the guys warm up was disconcerting—I’ve never seen so many bricks in my life. There was one player though that caught our eyes—we counted at least 10 three-pointers that freshman Max Hooper made without a miss. The Crimson has its work cut out for it to finally reach the next stage of its development—it will require hard work, no doubt about it.
Most importantly, congratulations to the seniors on the team. You guys impacted the program in a big way and accomplished things that 66 years worth of players tried to do. Thank you for everything.
Okay, I’m done with my game analysis. As for the experience, it once again validated why I made the trip despite breaking the bank. UNM’s “The Pit” hosted fans from all over the country, creating an exciting environment that never quieted down. We went early to catch the first game between Montana and Wisconsin, and though I was not invested in either team, the crowd made it super fun to watch. It was like a home game for all teams involved. There were also a lot of Albuquerque residents, some watching the doubleheader and many crowding around the flat screens stationed around the arena to follow what was going on with their beloved Lobos. When UNM finally edged out Long Beach State during the Harvard game, the crowd erupted into huge cheers for the hometown team. I genuinely celebrated for Los Lobos—Albuquerque had been really kind to us, so it felt right.
There’s not much to say about the Montana-Wisconsin game, but maybe that the result was not indicative of how close it actually was for most of it. Also, a huge thanks to the NCAA for paying for the cheerleading teams—particularly Montana’s—to come. And the bands added a lot to the atmosphere as well; there were some cool songs played and dance routines.
Food was expensive, but that was expected. New Mexico makes a tasty angus burger, I must say. And the chili is pretty damn good (in Colorado too).
As the first game wound down, the section of Harvard alumni grew. My friends and I were among the only students there, but it was great to see how many people care about Harvard men’s basketball after graduation. There were former basketball players—notably Donald B. Swegan, a player from the 1946 team that last made it to the Big Dance—parents, Friends of Harvard Basketball, the athletic director, alumni from around the area, faculty, etc. It was awesome to meet so many cool and accomplished people.
I did find it a little weird to be sitting down at a basketball game after spending a season jumping up and down in the student section and yelling my voice away. Sitting down takes quite a bit away from the experience, so eventually I lost regard for those around me and evoked my inner Hugh Archibald. By the end of it all, I lost my voice, but it was totally worth it. Makes me wonder what it would have been like to have the tournament come back to Boston. That would be a crazy time.
After the loss, I went with my friend’s family to the Harvard reception at a nearby hotel, where Crimson coach Tommy Amaker and his team arrived shortly after their press conference to receive a standing ovation from the room full of alumni. Athletic Director Bob Scalise honored Amaker in the center of the room, and Amaker did the same for the seniors on the team and proceeded to thank the band and cheerleaders for their efforts. Our friend Swegan was given witty customized T-shirts as gifts, and former players from the 1950's received some as well. It was an emotional ceremony and very well deserved.
That gathering marked the end of Harvard’s run in the NCAA tournament for the first time in 66 years. Bittersweet, yes, but we finally took the first steps towards an eventual NCAA championship (knock on wood). As Amaker implied during the small ceremony, hopefully we’ll be back next year, and if the NCAA is a little kinder to Harvard and places it somewhere near home, I’ll definitely be there too. After this experience, I would encourage everyone to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After setting the NCAA record for ties in a season in 2011-12, the Harvard men’s hockey team could not find an equalizer when it needed one most.
With a berth to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2006 on the line, the Crimson blew a third-period lead and could not convert on a number of late chances to tie the game before Union added an empty-netter and won its first-ever ECAC championship, 3-1.
“I’m disappointed for our guys,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought we worked very hard. I don’t know if we had the same jump tonight that we’ve had over the last few weekends—and obviously I want to give credit for some of that to Union as well—but our guys battled.”
The loss brings to an end a season in which the Crimson surpassed all expectations in even reaching the title game.
Harvard (13-10-11, 8-5-9 ECAC) was picked to finish dead last in the ECAC preseason media poll, but thanks to a late-season run energized by the breakout play of sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard, the No. 19 Crimson topped Yale, last year’s champion, in the best-of-three quarters, and crushed No. 13 Cornell, 6-1, in the semis to reach the finals.
But its loss Saturday night left Harvard on the outside looking in at the tournament while the No. 6 Dutchmen will play on.
Union (24-7-7, 14-4-4) largely dominated the first two periods, outshooting the Crimson, 27-10. But Girard saved each of those Dutchmen shots, and 4:52 into the third, Harvard found the back of the net first. Junior forward Alex Fallstrom got loose on a fast break and centered the puck perfectly for senior forward Alex Killorn, who backhanded a shot through the legs of Union goalie Troy Grosenick to put the Crimson ahead. It was the 53rd, and final, goal of the All-Ivy standout’s career.
“When Killorn scored that goal, I think it was the shot of adrenaline we felt we needed to give us a bit of a boost,” Donato said.
But after neither team had scored in the game’s first 45 minutes, the Dutchmen tied things up just 37 seconds after Killorn’s goal, when Union forward Jeremy Welsh beat his defender, junior Danny Biega, and put a wrist shot through the legs of Biega and Girard from the right circle.
“That’s been a little bit of an Achilles heel all year for us,” Donato said. “After we’ve scored, we’ve given up a goal pretty soon thereafter.”
Four minutes later, Union took a 2-1 lead. Girard made a save on a shot from the right point by the Dutchmen’s Josh Jooris, but the puck deflected out to Shayne Gostisbehere at the left circle. Gostisbehere fired on net, and Girard made the save again, but Daniel Carr buried the rebound from the right side to put Union ahead.
Harvard had a several chances to tie the game late but could not convert.
With three minutes to go, junior forward David Valek took a pass from senior forward Eric Kroshus in front of the net, but Valek’s ensuing shot hit the post. Moments later, freshman forward Tommy O’Reagan got free on a breakaway and had an open look at the net from the left circle, but Grosenick made the save.
With two minutes remaining, Biega got loose in the slot, but Grosenick again responded with a pad save. He made a glove save on a Killorn shot thirty seconds later, and before the Crimson could get another chance, Jurris put the game away with an empty-net goal with 20.5 seconds left, setting off the Dutchmen’s championship celebration.
“We had some good looks in the third,” Donato said. “I was very proud of our guys for the way they finished and the way they battled all season.”
Union was in control for much of the first two periods, but both teams were unable to convert on chances to score.
“Even though I made some good saves, guys were taking sticks in front of me, getting rebounds in the corner,” said Girard, who finished with 31 stops and led all ECAC goaltenders with a .947 playoff save percentage. “The guys gave me the best chance to stop the puck every shot I had.”
The Crimson didn’t get a shot off for the first 17 minutes of the second period, as Union showed why it is first in the nation in goals-against average.
“They made it tough for us, made us play in our zone a lot,” Donato said.
Harvard did manage four shots on goal in the final moments of the second frame, but Grosenik held, and the game went into the final period tied.
“I don’t think we had the same legs that we’ve had recently,” Donato said. “But there’s no excuses. The truth of it is, Union’s a very good hockey team, and they were deserving of winning tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just under three minutes into sudden-death overtime, senior attackman Jeff Cohen fired a shot from the right side of the box into the back of the net, giving the Harvard men’s lacrosse team a 10-9 victory over Brown Saturday night at Harvard Stadium after it had spent nearly the entire game battling from behind. As his teammates rushed the field, Cohen got on one knee and celebrated his fifth and most dramatic goal of the day by mimicking a pose popularized by Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow.
Only moments earlier, the Crimson’s opponent had almost scored the game-winning goal. On the other side of the field, Bears senior attackman Parker Brown cut through traffic and fired a shot on goal from point-blank range, only to see the ball batted away by freshman goaltender Jake Gambitsky.
The game, which marked the beginning of the Ivy League season for both teams, was a critical contest for Harvard (3-3, 1-0 Ivy), which had dropped three straight contests prior to its matchup with Brown (2-3, 0-1 Ivy). But the team was unfazed.
“We like to take it game by game,” co-captain Kevin Vaughan said. “We try not to think of it as a chance to come back from a loss.”
After beginning the fourth quarter trailing, 7-6, the Crimson let up a quick goal to the Bears’ Sam Hurster. In a two-score hole, Harvard’s veterans stepped up. Vaughan delivered a pass in front of the Brown net to Cohen, who scored from close range. With nine minutes left to play, Cohen struck again, this time spinning in front of the crease and firing a shot into the back of the net as he fell.
Cohen scored his third straight goal just over a minute later, a shot which flew under the stick of Bears goaltender Will Round, to put the Crimson ahead, 9-8—its first lead of the game—with 7:43 to play in the fourth quarter.
But Brown would respond two minutes later, as freshman attackman Nick Piroli fired a shot past Gambitsky to tally his third goal and pull the Bears even at nine.
Neither team could find the back of the net in the remaining five-and-a-half minutes of regulation. Brown called a time-out with just over 30 seconds remaining to set up its final possession, but the Bears’ aspirations were thwarted as Vaughan stripped senior attackman Dan O’Brien and cleared the ball out of the zone to send the game into overtime.
Freshman attackman Keegan Michael won the opening faceoff in the extra period and charged through the Brown defense before firing a mid-range shot which was snagged by Round. The Bears’ only overtime possession was fruitless thanks to Gambitsky’s quick hands, and Vaughan set up Cohen for the game-winner on Harvard’s next time down the field.
The Crimson was forced to play much of the game from behind thanks to a slow start. Both offenses struggled in the first half, with Harvard turning the ball over eleven times and managing only three goals from Cohen and sophomore attackmen Carl Zimmerman and Daniel Eipp. Eipp’s goal came off a feed from Zimmerman with two minutes remaining in the first half, and it cut Brown’s lead to 4-3 at the break.
“We were down a lot of the game, but we kept chipping away,” Harvard coach Chris Wocjik said. “We knew we were going to get our chances if we stayed confident and poised.”
Piroli was the first to score in the third quarter, netting a goal three minutes in. Eipp and Zimmerman connected again, scoring a man-up goal a minute later to answer. Six minutes into the quarter, a shot from co-captain Terry White deflected off the post, but Zimmerman was in front of the net to scoop up the rebound and score the game-tying goal.
Johnny DePeters put the Bears ahead again with an unassisted goal before White answered with his first goal of the season with three minutes to play in the quarter. DePeters completed his hat trick with just 13 seconds to play in the quarter, sending the Crimson into the final frame trailing, 7-6, and setting the stage for its come from behind win.
Gambitsky allowed nine goals on 15 shots in his second career start but came up huge when the stakes were highest.
“He made a huge save to give us the ball back and put us in position to win,” Wocjik said. “That’s a big play coming from a freshman.”
Cohen’s prolific scoring—his five goals Saturday give him 23 on the season—puts him among the top three scorers in the nation with just under four goals per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 10, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team made history by going into overtime for a second straight game, the first such feat in the program’s existence.
One week later, it looked as if the Crimson was going to need extra time for the third straight game, drawing even with Johns Hopkins with just 98 seconds remaining.
But the Blue Jays struck with just 19 ticks left, securing an 8-7 win for Johns Hopkins Saturday afternoon at Homewood Field in Baltimore, Md.
The Crimson (2-3, 0-2 Ivy) staged a comeback in the game’s final minutes, battling back from a three-goal second-half deficit to pull even with 1:48 remaining. Junior Jennifer VanderMeulen netted the equalizer after strong ball movement resulted in Harvard finding the attacker open in front of the net.
Johns Hopkins took the ensuing draw control, and the Blue Jays (6-2) put the ball in the stick of sophomore midfielder Taylor D’Amore.
D’Amore waited for the clock to wind down and then attacked the goal, drawing a foul with less than 30 seconds remaining. When play resumed, D’Amore found Colleen McCaffrey open to the right of the net.
McCaffrey faked high and shot low, beating Crimson goalkeeper Kelly Weis to put Johns Hopkins up one, 8-7, with 19 seconds remaining.
The Blue Jays won the following draw control and ran out the clock, putting an end to Harvard’s comeback attempt.
“In the second half, we picked up our play, but it was just kind of too little too late,” said junior Micaela Cyr, who finished with one goal and one draw control. “We need to continue working on putting a full game together.”
Four other Crimson players found the back of the net on Saturday, with juniors Danielle Tetreault and Nina Kucharczyk contributing two goals apiece.
Kucharczyk, who entered Saturday’s contest scoreless on the season, provided a crucial spark off the bench for the Crimson. After the Crimson fell behind, 5-2, with 5:37 to play in the first half, the junior helped bring Harvard back. She notched her first goal off a free-position shot with 25:25 to play in the second, bringing the Crimson within one, 5-4.
“That got everybody going,” tri-captain Ellen Gleason said.
Johns Hopkins responded with back-to-back scores from Sammy Cermack and Sarah Taylor to extend its lead to three, 7-4, with 13:47 to go.
After the Crimson struggled to find the net over the next seven minutes of play, Cyr scored off a pass from Tetreault to bring Harvard within two.
Kucharczyk followed suit 2:03 later with her second score of the game.
“They gave her some room, and she went to work and did her thing,” Cyr said.
Kucharcyk’s second goal pulled the Crimson within one, 7-6.
“She really helped us out,” Gleason said. “She’s so fast. She’s incredibly quick. She’s probably one of the hardest people to defend, as a defender going against her in practice.”
VanderMeulen, the Ivy League’s leading scorer in 2011, completed the comeback, notching her first score with 1:38 left.
But the Blue Jays quickly regained the lead on their next possession after McCaffrey scored her 19th goal of the season.
“Hopkins has some strong offensive players, and I thought that we actually had some great stands the last couple times on defense,” Gleason said. “We ended up fouling [D’Amore], but I thought it was tough defense.”
D’Amore played a crucial role in establishing the Blue Jay’s early lead. After Harvard sophomore Jenn Leffew gave the Crimson an early 1-0 advantage, D’Amore answered less than two minutes later, finishing a pass from Rachel Ballatori for her 20th score of the year.
Tetreault put the Crimson back in the lead 37 seconds later with her first score, but Harvard’s lead was short-lived. The Blue Jays answered with a 4-0 run to grab a commanding 5-2 lead at the half.
“We started out a little slow, unsure of ourselves,” Gleason said of the Crimson’s first-half performance.
Harvard came out stronger in the second half, outscoring Johns Hopkins, 5-3, in the frame.
“We came out fighting in the second,” Gleason said. “I thought we started really playing together as a team. We got some draw controls; we forced some turnovers. We made some good stands on defense and were patient on offense.”
But it was not enough, as McCaffrey silenced the Crimson’s comeback attempt.
